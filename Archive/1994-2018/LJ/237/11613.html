Integrating Twitter into your application is easy, fun and useful.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3d580.0x1b353b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'm a very quick adopter of many new software technologies. I try new
programming languages, browsers, databases and frameworks without
hesitation. But when it comes to social networks, I'm a bit of a
Luddite, waiting to see what all the fuss is about before making them
a part of my life. Sure, I signed up for Facebook almost as soon as
it was available, but I haven't really posted much there. I do use
LinkedIn, mostly to collect and find contacts, but I don't post
there very often either, unless I'm announcing a presentation that I've added
to SlideShare.
</p><p>
Twitter is something of a different story. There are people, it seems,
for whom Twitter is the ultimate in communication. I've been on
Twitter for some time, but other than an occasional foray into that
world, I didn't really pay it much attention. Even now, after having
decided several months ago that I should try to get into Twitter more
heavily, I find that while I look through my feed several times a day,
I tweet only once every few weeks. Call me a dinosaur, but I still
prefer to use e-mail to be in touch with friends and family, rather
than 140-character messages.
</p><p>
Although I don't see Twitter as a great medium for interpersonal
communication, I recently have begun to appreciate it for other
reasons. Specifically, I have discovered (perhaps long after the rest
of the world has done so) that using Twitter as a sort of public
logfile can make a Web application more visible, updating the rest of
the world as to the status of your work and your on-line community.
Doing so not only lets people hear about what you are doing&mdash;and
potentially rebroadcast it to the world, by &ldquo;retweeting&rdquo; your message
to followers&mdash;but it also increases your application's SEO, or
visibility on various search engines. Finally, you can use Twitter to
bring attention to your on-line presence by following other people.
(The idea is that when they receive your follow request, they may try
to find out more about you, exploring your site or even following you
back.)
</p><p>
I might sound like a social-media consultant, but I've seen the
difference that Twitter can make in an application. I recently
connected my PhD dissertation project (the Modeling Commons, at
<a href="http://modelingcommons.org" target="_self">modelingcommons.org</a>) to Twitter, such that each public action
is sent to the Twitter feed. The combination of tweeting updates and
following other people has had a remarkable and direct effect on the
number of visitors who come to my site, the length of time they
remain and the number of pages they view. Now, I'm not talking
about millions of visitors per month. My application is still of
interest mainly to a small community of people working with the
NetLogo modeling environment. But the change has been obvious, and I
grudgingly admit that I owe some of it to Twitter.
</p><p>
In this article, I explore some of the things I did to use
Twitter in my application. From a technology perspective, you'll see
that the implementation was fairly straightforward. But I think that
what I've learned can be of interest to anyone running a Web
application, particularly one that is trying to get the word out to
the public. In addition, although there are plenty of good reasons to
question Twitter's business practices and its relationship with
developers, there is no doubt that its attention to detail with
its API offers a model for all of us who want to provide APIs to our
applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3d580.0x1b357d0"></a>
Registering with Twitter</h2></div></div><p>
I'm going to assume that anyone reading this article already
has created a Twitter account or is able to figure out how to do so at
Twitter.com. And of course, via the Twitter.com Web site, you can do
all the things that you might expect, such as tweeting, retweeting,
following and searching.
</p><p>
Twitter's API allows you to do all of these things via code. That is,
you don't need to go and compose tweets personally. You can write a
program that will do so for you. In order for this to happen, you
need to do two things: register with Twitter's API service and
install a library that knows how to communicate with the Twitter API.
</p><p>
In order to register with the Twitter API, you need to go to the
&ldquo;developer&rdquo; site at <a href="http://dev.twitter.com" target="_self">dev.twitter.com</a>. Note that you need
to sign in with your Twitter user name and password, even if you 
already are signed in to the main Twitter site. The two sites do not seem
to share login sessions.
</p><p>
Once you're on the developer site, you need to create a new
application. The application name needs to be unique, but don't worry
about it too much. You need to provide not only a name, but also
a description and a URL that is associated with the application.
Agree to the terms, fill in the Captcha, and you'll be on your way.
Note that many types of Twitter applications exist,
with many applications (including mobile) that post to Twitter on
behalf of a user. The model I demonstrate in this article
is of an application sending updates to Twitter, which means you
won't have such issues&mdash;you don't need a callback URL
or any special login configuration.
</p><p>
Perhaps the most confusing thing (to me, at least) about setting
things up with Twitter was that the default permissions for an
application allows you to retrieve tweets, but not post to them. To
allow your application read-write access, go to the settings tab and
indicate that you want the read-write access, or even read, write
and direct message. You won't be using all of these capabilities for this
example, but
without write permission, your application will not be able to post to
Twitter.
</p><p>
And now for the most important part, the keys: Twitter's
authentication model requires two tokens. First, there is your access
token, which allows you to access Twitter via the API. The second is
the &ldquo;consumer key&rdquo;, which describes your particular application and
usage. Each of these keys has an accompanying secret, which you
should treat as a password. As such, putting these secrets directly
in your application probably is a bad idea. You would be better off
putting them in environment variables, thus avoiding having the
secrets in version control.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3d580.0x1b35b98"></a>
&ldquo;Twitter&rdquo; Gem for Ruby</h2></div></div><p>
Readers of this column know that I love the Ruby language, so it won't
come as a surprise to hear that I intend to use Ruby for my examples.
However, there are Twitter API clients in virtually every modern
language, making it easy to access from whatever you prefer to use in
your programming.
</p><p>
The twitter Ruby gem, as is the case for all Ruby gems (libraries),
is available for installation via the gem program, which comes with
modern versions of Ruby. The gem currently is maintained by Erik
Michaels-Ober, also known as &ldquo;sferik&rdquo; on GitHub. You can type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem install twitter -V
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3d580.0x1b35e00"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the gem should be installed. On many systems, including those not
running a Ruby version manager like rvm, you need to execute
the above line while logged in as root.
</p><p>
Once you have installed the gem, you can use it. There are three
parts to this process: bringing the gem into the program, configuring
it to use your keys and secrets, and then executing a Twitter command.
The first is handled with the Ruby <tt  >require</tt> command, which looks at
installed gems, as well as the Ruby core and standard libraries.
</p><p>
Configuration of the client is handled fairly straightforwardly from
within a block that looks like this (filling in the values you got
from Twitter's API documentation):


<pre     class="programlisting">
twitter_client = Twitter::REST::Client.new do |config|
  config.consumer_key = CONSUMER_KEY
  config.consumer_secret = CONSUMER_SECRET
  config.oauth_token = OAUTH_TOKEN
  config.oauth_token_secret = OAUTH_SECRET
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that you are not merely executing the &ldquo;new&rdquo; method on
<tt  >Twitter::REST::Client</tt>, but that you also are returning a value. Thus,
in contrast to previous versions of Ruby's Twitter gem, you should
accept the returned object, which is then the basis for all of the
additional actions you wish to take.
</p><p>
Finally, you send the tweet with the &ldquo;update&rdquo; method:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tweet = twitter_client.update("Hello, world. Tweet tweet.")
</pre>
</p><p>
Invoking the #update method has the effect of sending the message to
Twitter. If you go to the Web page for your Twitter user, you'll find
that a new message has been sent, as if you had typed it.
</p><p>
If you capture the return value from the invocation of
<tt  >twitter_client.update</tt>, you'll see that it is an instance of
<tt  >Twitter::Tweet</tt>, a Ruby object that represents a tweet. This object
provides the functionality that you would want and expect from
something associated from Twitter. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tweet.user          # tells us who wrote the tweet
tweet.retweeted?    # indicates whether it was retweeted
tweet.favorited?    # indicates whether it was marked as a favorite
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, it's also possible that you will not get a tweet object back at
all, but rather that the &ldquo;update&rdquo; method will raise an exception. For
example, Twitter forbids users from sending an identical tweet, at
least within a short period of time. Thus, if you send the above
&ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; tweet (from the example above) a second time, you'll
get an exception:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Twitter::Error::Forbidden: Status is a duplicate.
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, you can catch such errors with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
begin
  tweet = twitter_client.update("Hello again, 
  &#8618;@reuvenmlerner  Tweet tweet.")
rescue Twitter::Error::Forbidden =&gt; e
  puts "You already tweeted that."
rescue =&gt; e
  puts e.class    # Twitter::Error::Forbidden
  puts e.message  # 'Status is a duplicate.'
end
</pre>
</p><p>
If you include a Twitter @username, hashtag or URL in your tweet, 
the appropriate magic will happen automatically. Thus:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tweet = twitter_client.update("Go to @reuvenmlerner's 
 &#8618;site at http://lerner.co.il/")
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above tweet, the URL automatically will be shortened, using
Twitter's standard t.co domain. Similarly, the @reuvenmlerner (my
Twitter handle) will turn into a link. You can access both of these
using methods on your tweet:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tweet.urls           # returns an array of Twitter::Entity::URI
tweet.user_mentions  # returns an array of 
                     # Twitter::Entity::UserMention
</pre>
</p><p>
You can more generally ask Twitter for information about tweets. For
example, you can get the most recent tweets a user has sent with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
twitter_client.user_timeline("reuvenmlerner")
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3d580.0x1b369b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which returns an array of tweet objects. You can apply the
&ldquo;text&rdquo;
method to the first element, thus getting the text back from the user's
most recent tweet:

<pre     class="programlisting">
twitter_client.user_timeline("reuvenmlerner")[0].text
</pre>
</p><p>
If there are URLs embedded in the tweet, you can get those back:

<pre     class="programlisting">
twitter_client.user_timeline("reuvenmlerner")[1].urls
</pre>
</p><p>
This method returns an array of <tt  >Twitter::Entity::URI</tt> objects, each of
which has attributes, such as &ldquo;url&rdquo; and &ldquo;expanded
URL&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a3d580.0x1f2efc8"></a>
Integrating into Your Application</h2></div></div><p>
As you can see, working with Twitter is surprisingly easy. The
startup time for connecting to Twitter can take a little bit of
time&mdash;up to two seconds, in my experience&mdash;but tweeting and querying
Twitter take very little time. It's obvious, as a consumer of the
API, that they have worked hard to make it execute as quickly as
possible. This is a lesson to all of us who create APIs. We all know
that Web pages should load quickly, and that slow load times can
discourage people from staying on a site.
</p><p>
API calls typically are embedded within another application, meaning
that if the API call takes time, the application itself will feel
sluggish. As a result, a slow API call will lead to slow responses
from the API clients&mdash;and may discourage people from using your API.
</p><p>
But where would you use such API calls? Why would you want to use
Twitter on your site?
</p><p>
One simple use of the Twitter API would be to display a user's most
recent tweets. For example, if your company (or you personally) use
Twitter to send messages about what you are doing, you can see that it
would be fairly easy to include those tweets in a Web page. Using an
MVC system, such as Rails, you simply would grab the tweets (with the
&ldquo;user_timeline&rdquo; method, as shown above), and stick the results on your
home page. Now your home page provides another view to your Twitter
feed, re-enforcing its importance and usage to your company.
</p><p>
I have been doing something slightly different. As I mentioned previously,
I have begun to use Twitter to log public activity in the application
I've developed for my dissertation. Every time a new user joins, new
content is posted or someone adds a posting to a discussion forum, I
send a new tweet on the subject. In and of itself, this doesn't do
very much; Twitter is full of text and URLs. But I have certainly
found by ensuring that my tweets are followed and seen by a large
number of people, I have increased the number of users
coming to my site.
</p><p>
In other words, by tweeting about activity on my site, I have given my
site additional exposure to the world. Moreover, people who really
want to see what my application is doing can follow the link in their
Twitter feed and follow along.
</p><p>
By adding a #NetLogo hashtag to my tweets, I also have made it
possible, and even easy, for my tweets (and thus my site) to be found
and identified by people searching Twitter for mentions of our
modeling environment. The fact that Google indexes tweets increases
my site's visibility on-line among people who are searching for
modeling-related sites.
</p><p>
The net effect has been rather huge. Within two weeks of starting to
use Twitter to announce updates on my site, the number of people
coming to visit has increased dramatically. Not coincidentally, my
site's ranking in Google has improved noticeably.
</p><p>
Now, if this were a commercial site, rather than a free infrastructure
for collaborative modeling, I would want to check a second thing,
namely the &ldquo;conversion rate&rdquo;&mdash;that is, how many people who came to
my site also became paying customers. But for my small, educational
site, it has been fascinating to see what a difference tweeting made.
</p><p>
And what did I do? Truth be told, not much. I set up things such that
a new tweet would be sent, using the &ldquo;update&rdquo; method demonstrated
above, every time a new model version, forum posting or person was
added to the system. Because of the relatively low latency on the
&ldquo;update&rdquo; method, I even do this inline on an
<tt  >after_create</tt> callback
within Rails, rather than queueing it in a background job.
</p><p>
The biggest technical challenge I have faced so far in all of
this is the issue of duplicate tweets. When I first set up the
Twitter feed, I defined the tweet for an additional discussion forum
post to be:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Reuven Lerner has added a comment about the Foobar model!
</pre>
</p><p>
The problem with this style of tweet is that it quickly can lead to
duplicates&mdash;and thus errors from within the application. As a
result, I have made sure that every tweet has a unique number in it
somewhere, typically counting how many similar objects already
have been created. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Reuven Lerner wrote the 5th comment about the Foobar model!
</pre>
</p><p>
The above ensures&mdash;assuming that user and model names are
unique&mdash;that there cannot be duplicates, thus avoiding the problem.
</p><p>
Beyond the advantages for users, SEO and people interested in
following my work, I also have found it to be enormously satisfying to
see tweets come out even when I'm not aware of it. It's similar in
some ways to seeing my children's creative output, but (obviously)
less emotionally charged.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Adding automatic tweets to a Web application is easy to do and can
have significant benefits. For your users, it gives them a way to
follow what is happening in your application without needing to visit
the site or use an RSS reader. For your site, automatic tweets
will help bring in new visitors, improve SEO and generally improve
your project's visibility.
