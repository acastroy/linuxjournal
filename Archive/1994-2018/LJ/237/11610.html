I don't know how many readers know this, but my very first <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
column (&ldquo;Browse the Web without a Trace&rdquo;, January 2008) was about how
to set up and use Tor. Anonymity and privacy on the Internet certainly
take on a different meaning in the modern era of privacy-invading
software and general Internet surveillance. I recently went back and
read my original column, and although the first few paragraphs were
written six years ago, they seem just as relevant today:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Is privacy dead? When I think about how much information my computer and
my gadgets output about me on a daily basis, it might as well be. My
cell phone broadcasts my general whereabouts, and my Web browser is
worse&mdash;every site I visit knows I was there, what I looked at, what
browser and OS I use, and if I have an account on the site, it could
know much more.
</p><p>
Even if you aren't paranoid (yet), you might want to browse the Web
anonymously for many reasons. For one, your information, almost all of
it, has value, and you might like to have some control over who has that
information and who doesn't. Maybe you just want to post a comment to
a blog without the owner knowing who you are. You even could have more
serious reasons, such as whistle-blowing, political speech or research
about sensitive issues such as rape, abuse or personal illness.
</p><p>
Whatever reason you have for anonymity, a piece of software called Tor
provides a secure, easy-to-setup and easy-to-use Web anonymizer. If you
are curious about how exactly Tor works, you can visit the official site
at <a href="http://tor.eff.org" target="_self">tor.eff.org</a>), but in a nutshell, Tor installs and runs on your local
machine. Once combined with a Web proxy, all of your traffic passes
through an encrypted tunnel between three different Tor servers before
it reaches the remote server. All that the remote site will know about
you is that you came from a Tor node. 
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The rest of the article went into detail on how to use the Knoppix live
disk to download and install Tor completely into ramdisk. Tor has come
a long way since those days though, so I decided it was high time
to revisit this topic and explain the best way to set up Tor on your
personal machine today.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2457580.0x254f880"></a>
Get the Tor Browser Bundle</h2></div></div><p>
In the past, Tor installation meant installing the Tor software itself,
configuring a proxy and pulling down a few browser plugins. Although you
still can set it up that way if you want, these days, everything is wrapped
up in a tidy little package called the Tor browser bundle. This single
package contains Tor, its own custom Web browser already configured with
privacy-enhancing settings and a user interface that makes it easy to
start and stop Tor on demand.
</p><p>
The first step is to visit <a href="https://www.torproject.org" target="_self">https://www.torproject.org</a> and check the lock
icon in your navigation bar to make sure the SSL certificate checks
out. If your browser gives you some sort of certificate warning, 
it's possible you aren't visiting the official Tor site, and you should
stop right there and attempt to get Tor from a different computer. On
the main page is a large Download Tor button for you to click. If you are
browsing the site from a Linux system (which of course you are), you will
be presented with links to a 32-bit and 64-bit browser bundle package,
so click the one that corresponds with the appropriate architecture for
your system.
</p><p>
While the software downloads, I highly recommend you do two things. First,
next to the button you clicked to download Tor, there should be a
hyperlink labeled &ldquo;sig&rdquo;. Click this link to download the signature you
will use to verify that the Tor package you downloaded was legitimate (I'll
talk about how to do that in a minute). The second thing you should do
is scroll down the page and start reading the section titled &ldquo;Want Tor
to really work?&rdquo; to familiarize yourself with some of the extra habits
you should take on if you really do want to browse the Web anonymously.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2457580.0x254fb40"></a>
Verify the Software</h2></div></div><p>
After you download the Tor browser bundle and the signature file, you
should have two files in your directory:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.3.25-14-dev-en-US.tar.gz
</p></li><li><p>
tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.3.25-14-dev-en-US.tar.gz.asc
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The first of these files is the software itself, and the second
file is the GPG signature. Although a lot of software uses MD5 or
SHA1 checksums so you can validate the software you downloaded
was complete, this checksum is different. The .asc file is a
cryptographic signature you can use to prove that the software
you just download actually was provided to you by the Tor project and
not by some malicious third party. The site provides documentation
on how to verify this signature for different operating systems at
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en" target="_self">https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en</a>, but since
you use Linux, here you will run the following commands. First, pull down
the key that was used to sign this package. Currently, this would be
Erinn Clark's key (0x416F061063FEE659), which you can import with the
following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg --keyserver x-hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net 
 &#8618;--recv-keys 0x416F061063FEE659
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the key has been imported, you should check its fingerprint:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ gpg --fingerprint 0x416F061063FEE659
pub   2048R/63FEE659 2003-10-16
     Key fingerprint = 8738 A680 B84B 3031 A630 F2DB 416F 0610 63FE E659
uid                  Erinn Clark &lt;erinn@torproject.org&gt;
uid                  Erinn Clark &lt;erinn@debian.org&gt;
uid                  Erinn Clark &lt;erinn@double-helix.org&gt;
sub   2048R/EB399FD7 2003-10-16

</pre>
</p><p>
If the fingerprint doesn't match what you see above, something fishy
is going on and you shouldn't trust this package. Of course, if you are
frequent GPG users, you may want even better assurances. Hopefully, you have
someone you already trust within your GPG keyring who has been to a
key-signing party with Erinn Clark. If so, it would help validate that the key
is legitimate.
</p><p>
Once you have validated the fingerprint, <tt  >cd</tt> to the directory that has
the browser bundle and .asc file, and run the following command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg --verify 
 &#8618;tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.3.25-14-dev-en-US.tar.gz{.asc,}
gpg: Signature made Fri 01 Nov 2013 01:25:10 PM PDT 
 &#8618;using RSA key ID 63FEE659
gpg: Good signature from "Erinn Clark &lt;erinn@torproject.org&gt;"
gpg:                 aka "Erinn Clark &lt;erinn@debian.org&gt;"
gpg:                 aka "Erinn Clark &lt;erinn@double-helix.org&gt;"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature 
              &#8618;belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 8738 A680 B84B 3031 A630  
 &#8618;F2DB 416F 0610 63FE E659
</pre>
</p><p>
If the output says &ldquo;Good signature&rdquo;, everything checked out.
Again,
you will see a warning if you don't have someone in your chain of trust
that already trusts this key.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2457580.0x25502d0"></a>
Install and Use Tor</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, it's relatively trivial to install and use Tor. Just use
tar to extract the .tar.gz file into your home directory or wherever else
you'd like it to be, and then run the start-tor-browser script inside:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar zxvf tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.3.25-14-dev-en-US.tar.gz
$ ./tor-browser_en-US/start-tor-browser
</pre>
</p><p>
You should see a GUI window pop up that looks like Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11610f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Vidalia Control Panel Window
</p></div></div><p>
It may take a little time for your Tor network to finish configuring,
but once it does, you will know, because a browser that looks like Figure 2
will appear.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11610f2.large.jpg"><img src="11610f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Congratulations, Tor works.
</p></div></div><p>
The initial Tor check page not only validates that you are using the Tor
network, it also displays your current IP address. If you ever notice
that IP address matches your home IP address, or if you don't see this
congratulations window at all, for some reason your Tor instance
isn't working properly, so you shouldn't do anything within the browser
that is privacy-sensitive. Note that because you may be exiting the
Tor network from an exit node in a different country, certain sites
like Google, for instance, that try to be helpful and display the site
in a country's native language may present you with Japanese, German
or some other language as you visit.
</p><p>
If you go back to the Vidalia Control Panel, you'll notice a number of
different options. You can view a map of the current global Tor network;
you can click the Setup Relaying button to add your machine to the network
of Tor nodes, and if you click Use a New Identity, you will stop using the
three Tor nodes you currently are using and will set up a new connection
with different Tor nodes. Although Tor itself does this routinely as you
use it, sometimes you may want to get a different endpoint so a Web site
stops displaying output in a language you don't understand.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2457580.0x2550958"></a>
Special Tor Browser Plugins</h2></div></div><p>
It's important to note that this special Tor browser has been configured
with extra plugins and settings to enhance your privacy. For instance,
by default, the Noscript plugin is installed and enabled, which blocks
JavaScript, Java and other plugins and allows them only for sites that
you trust. The browser also includes the HTTPS Everywhere plugin that
defaults to using HTTPS for any site you try to visit. You also will see
a small onion icon in the navigation bar that you can use to tweak your
Tor preferences inside the browser.
</p><p>
Once you are done browsing anonymously, close your browser and go back to
the Vidalia Control Panel. If you are done using Tor completely, click the
Stop Tor button, and then click exit to close the application. Browsing
the Web anonymously and privately has never been this easy.
