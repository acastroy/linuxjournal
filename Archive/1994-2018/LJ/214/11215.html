Writing a small Web app? Consider Sinatra, a micro-framework that makes
Web development quick and easy.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e59580.0x1f51300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For the past month or two, I have been teaching my nine-year-old
daughter to program in Ruby. She has enjoyed it a great deal, as have
I. To be honest, I've been a bit surprised by how much she has gotten
out of the experience and how excited she is to be discovering the
joy of programming.
</p><p>
Not surprisingly, I'm planning to introduce her to the wonderful world
of Web development. But given that we're working with Ruby, I was a
bit concerned. After all, the de facto standard for Web development
in Ruby is Rails, and although I think Rails is a wonderful
framework, it always has assumed that newcomers were at least familiar
with the basics of Web development. Modern versions of Rails, with
CoffeeScript, Sass stylesheets, an asset pipeline and many other
features (which are wonderful in their own right) would pose a
pedagogical challenge for both my daughter and me.
</p><p>
Just as I was trying to figure out how to introduce Rails or whether I
should give up on the idea of teaching her Web development at all, I
realized I had been overlooking a gem (no pun intended) of
software that is perfect for these purposes&mdash;Sinatra. Sinatra has been
around for a few years already, but I never really gave it much
thought. It turns out, however, that Sinatra is as easy (or easier!) than
the CGI programs I wrote back in the early days of the Web, supports a
huge number of plugins and features, can be hosted easily on Heroku or
Phusion Passenger and is a great deal of fun to work with.
</p><p>
So in this article, I'm taking a look at Sinatra.
I describe how to
configure and install it and explain why I'm convinced that whenever I now
need to do a quick-and-dirty Web application, Sinatra (and not Rails)
will be my tool of choice.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e59580.0x1f515c0"></a>
Sinatra Origins and Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Sinatra first was written by Blake Mizerany, a longtime Ruby
programmer who currently works at GitHub. Sinatra is an example of
both a micro-framework&mdash;that is, a Web development framework that
handles just the bare minimum of what you might want to do&mdash;and also
a domain-specific language (DSL). A DSL gives you a narrow, but deep,
vocabulary for writing programs in a particular domain, allowing you
to concentrate on the high-level development process, rather than the
nitty-gritty details.
</p><p>
Sinatra makes it ridiculously easy to put together Web applications,
because that's all it is meant to do. At the same time, it's
still written in Ruby, meaning that you have access to the language's
core functionality, along with gems, ranging from ActiveRecord (from
Rails) to templates to network-communication systems.
</p><p>
To create a simple Sinatra application, you first have to install the
Sinatra gem, either as root or (if you are using rvm, the wonderful
Ruby version manager) as a nonroot user:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem install sinatra
</pre>
</p><p>
With that in place, you're ready to get started! You can create a
file that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  "Hello"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
It doesn't get easier than this, right? The first line indicates
that you want to execute Ruby. The second and third lines load the Gem
libraries and also the &ldquo;sinatra&rdquo; gem itself. The third line defines a
route, such that if a Web browser uses the GET method to request /,
the method defined in the &ldquo;do&rdquo; block is executed. Run this program,
and you see this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
 ~/Desktop $ ./atf-sinatra.rb
   == Sinatra/1.3.1 has taken the stage on 4567 for 
      development with backup from Thin
   &gt;&gt; Thin web server (v1.3.1 codename Triple Espresso)
   &gt;&gt; Maximum connections set to 1024
   &gt;&gt; Listening on 0.0.0.0:4567, CTRL+C to stop
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, you're now running a live Web application, via an HTTP
server (Thin, if you have installed it on your system&mdash;otherwise,
Sinatra tries to find something else). As I mentioned previously, Sinatra
makes the development of Web applications easier and faster than 
ever was the case, even with CGI programs, and with many more capabilities.

Listing 1. atf-sinatra.rb</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
require 'erb'

get '/' do
 @first_number = rand(5000)
 @second_number = rand(@first_number)
 @operation = %w(+ - *).sample
 erb :index
end

post '/answer' do
 @first_number = params[:first_number].to_i
 @second_number = params[:second_number].to_i
 @operation = params[:operation].to_s

 @user_answer = params[:user_answer].to_i
 @right_answer = @first_number.send(@operation, @second_number)

 erb :answer
end
</pre></div><p>
You can stop the application by pressing Ctrl-C. Note that unlike
Rails in development mode, Sinatra doesn't (by default, at least)
notice when the program has changed and update itself accordingly.
If you want to have such functionality, you can install the
&ldquo;shotgun&rdquo;
gem, which restarts the application with each request.
</p><p>
Sinatra uses the common Rack interface for Web applications under
Ruby. This means that a Sinatra application, even one as simple as
what I have written here, can be deployed anywhere that supports Rack,
such as the various Ruby-flavored HTTP servers (for example Phusion
Passenger) or on hosting sites like Heroku.
</p><p>
Of course, Web applications tend to receive input from the user.
Simple parameters can come as part of the URL, following a question
mark (?) character. A POST request also can contain parameters, but
they are sent in a separate channel. Sinatra can handle both of
these:

<pre     class="programlisting">
get '/' do
  "Hello, #{params[:name]}"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
If I invoke this as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
http://localhost:4567/?name=Reuven
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e59580.0x1f51fb8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
my Web browser happily prints the text:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Hello, Reuven
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e59580.0x1f52118"></a>
Views</h2></div></div><p>
Now, it's certainly possible to produce a working Web application
using just the above. But, the output in this example is fairly
limited. It's safe to assume that in anything more sophisticated than
a &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; program, you'll want to use a templating system to
display your views. Fortunately, Sinatra supports not just ERb
templates, but also a number of other types, including popular Haml
templates.
</p><p>
For example, let's say you want your &ldquo;GET /&rdquo; handler to invoke an
ERb template, and that you will call the template &ldquo;index&rdquo;. Create a
subdirectory named views in the same directory where the Sinatra
application is located. Then, put a file named index.erb in the
views directory, and put some text into it:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sinatra index&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Sinatra&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;%= @name %&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, modify the &ldquo;get&rdquo; handler method such that it both uses the
ERb template and so that it assigns the instance variable
<tt  >@name</tt> with
something:

<pre     class="programlisting">
get '/' do
  erb :index
  @name = params[:name]
end
</pre>
</p><p>
As is the case in all ERb templates, such as in Rails, instance
variables (that is, those starting with @) are passed untouched to the
template. Your ERb template may contain any HTML you want, as well
as Ruby code inside of the &lt;% %&gt; delimiters. One bug (or feature?)
that kept biting me was the lack of &lt;%= -%&gt; delimiters, as in Rails. I
quickly trained my fingers not to type it, but I admittedly was confused
when Sinatra gave me a stack backtrace that was less than obvious.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e59580.0x1f525e8"></a>
A Simple Application</h2></div></div><p>
So, what kinds of simple applications can you create with Sinatra? You
can, of course, use a database on the back end or any number of 
other features, such as sessions or authentication. But, there are
a lot of little applications I've written during the years that
didn't require much in the way of server-side programming. One
example is a simple math-practice program I wrote for my
daughters several years ago using Rails. How easy would it be to
produce such a program in Sinatra?
</p><p>
First, you need two different handlers, one for GET
requests and one to POST the answers. The GET handler will choose
two random numbers and a math operation to perform on them. This
handler then will display the results as a math problem on a page of
HTML, providing a form in which the user can submit the answer. My
GET handler looked like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
get '/' do
  @first_number = rand(5000)
  @second_number = rand(@first_number)
  @operation = %w(+ - *).sample
  erb :index
end
</pre>
</p><p>
This code sets three instance variables, the values of which then
are available for display in the ERb template, which will be index.erb
in the views directory. The first number can be anything up to
5,000, and the second number must be smaller than the first. I then
allowed for addition, subtraction and multiplication. Doing division
with two 4-digit numbers seemed like a stretch for my children at this
stage, even by my tough standards. By giving the first number as the
parameter to the second call to rand(), you ensure that the second
number will be no larger than the first&mdash;an important consideration
when producing elementary-school problems.
</p><p>
index.erb (Listing 2) is, as you would expect, rather plain. The most
interesting part is the HTML form, into which users will provide
their answers:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;form method="POST" action="/answer"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="user_answer" /&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit answer" /&gt;
  &lt;input type="hidden" name="first_number" 
   value="&lt;%= @first_number %&gt;" /&gt;
  &lt;input type="hidden" name="second_number" 
   value="&lt;%= @second_number %&gt;" /&gt;
  &lt;input type="hidden" name="operation" 
   value="&lt;%= @operation %&gt;" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how the original operands and operation are kept as hidden
fields in the form. This allows you to avoid putting them in the
session and makes debugging easier.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e59580.0x1f52958"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. index.erb</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Sinatra Math&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;Sinatra Math&lt;/h1&gt;

   &lt;pre&gt;
       &lt;%= sprintf("%6d", @first_number) %&gt;
       &lt;%= @operation %&gt; &lt;%= sprintf("%4d", @second_number) %&gt;
   &lt;/pre&gt;
   &lt;hr align="left" width="200" /&gt;

   &lt;form method="POST" action="/answer"&gt;
     &lt;input type="text" name="user_answer" /&gt;
     &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit answer" /&gt;
     &lt;input type="hidden" name="first_number" 
      value="&lt;%= @first_number %&gt;" /&gt;
     &lt;input type="hidden" name="second_number" 
      value="&lt;%= @second_number %&gt;" /&gt;
     &lt;input type="hidden" name="operation" 
      value="&lt;%= @operation %&gt;" /&gt;
   &lt;/form&gt;

 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
The answer-checking program, which expects to receive three parameters
(first_number, second_number and operation), then grabs them and
calculates the right answer:


<pre     class="programlisting">
post '/answer' do
  @first_number = params[:first_number].to_i
  @second_number = params[:second_number].to_i
  @operation = params[:operation].to_s

  @user_answer = params[:user_answer].to_i
  @right_answer = @first_number.send(@operation, @second_number)

  erb :answer
end
</pre>
</p><p>
There is a bit of magic in the above code. Because operators (such as
+) are methods in Ruby, you can turn the operator into a symbol and
then send that symbol to the first operand. In other words, the Ruby
calculation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
5 + 3
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e59580.0x1f495b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
is always turned into:

<pre     class="programlisting">
5.send(:+, 3)
</pre>
</p><p>
But in this case, you do it explicitly, turning the string into a
symbol.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e59580.0x1f49768"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. answer.erb</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Sinatra Math&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;Sinatra Math&lt;/h1&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Problem: &lt;%= "#{@first_number} #{@operation} 
                    #{@second_number}" %&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Your answer: &lt;%= @user_answer %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Right answer: &lt;%= @right_answer %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;% if @user_answer == @right_answer %&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;You got it right!&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;% else %&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Sorry, you got it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;% end %&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;Try again?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
It took me just a few minutes to throw together this program. With a
bit more time, it's hard to say just what the limit would be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e59580.0x1f499d0"></a>
Other Features</h2></div></div><p>
Sinatra is packed with features. It's hard to exaggerate just
what this tiny framework can do. For example, if you want to use
sessions, such that you can carry user data from one HTTP request to
the next, you can enable the &ldquo;sessions&rdquo; feature:

<pre     class="programlisting">
enable :sessions
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates a hash-like object (&ldquo;session&rdquo;) into which you can store
or retrieve any Ruby object&mdash;although it's generally considered to
be a good idea to store only simple objects, keeping more serious ones
inside of a database or object store.
</p><p>
Sinatra also provides sophisticated routing, such that you can tell it
to accept requests for a particular URL template and then put one or
more elements of the template into parameters. Sinatra provides
before-and-after filters, which can be activated on some or all of the
handlers. Really, the number of simple applications that are
appropriate for Sinatra is almost limitless.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e59580.0x1f49ce8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
If you want to throw together a simple Web application, but don't want
the overhead of Rails, you seriously should try Sinatra. It has a
huge number of features, great documentation, lots of community
support, and it can be deployed just about everywhere Rails can be. I'm
planning to use Sinatra for many small projects in the future, both
with and without my kids. It's not as powerful as Rails, but that's
just the point!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e59580.0x1f49df0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Resources</b></p><p>
The Sinatra home page is at <a href="http://sinatrarb.com" target="_self">sinatrarb.com</a>. From there, you also
can get to the Sinatra book (<a href="http://sinatra-book.gittr.com" target="_self">sinatra-book.gittr.com</a>) and the
community-supported Rack (<a href="http://sinatra-book-contrib.com" target="_self">sinatra-book-contrib.com</a>).
</p><p>
There are similar small frameworks in Python, if you're less of a
Rubyist, such as &ldquo;Denied&rdquo;. I have played with these only briefly, but
they're worth examining if you and/or your project works better with
Python.
