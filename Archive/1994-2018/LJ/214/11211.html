Using Drupal to manage and display data.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a1b580.0x2b13250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Drupal is one of the most popular and versatile platforms for Web
design. It's free, open source and will run on Linux. Early last year,
a new version was released (Drupal 7), making it even better with
improvements in usability, performance and security. If you've looked
at Drupal before, but didn't end up using it, you may want to take
another look.
</p><p>
Drupal is built using a modular structure to accommodate extensions from
third-party developers. These modules allow you to add features that
otherwise might be unavailable. The improvements to Drupal 7 make them
far more accessible and easier for new users.
</p><p>
This article covers the basics of creating a data scheme (that is, content
types), how to manipulate that data (that is, views) and fundamental ways
to display data in Drupal 7. For the examples in this article, I use products of
a business site that sells writing instruments. I assume you have
already downloaded the Drupal 7 from drupal.org and have 
installed it successfully.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a1b580.0x2b13510"></a>
Content Types</h2></div></div><p>
A content type is simply a definition of a table of data, such as text,
numbers and images. Behind the scenes, Drupal uses MySQL for storing
data. When you create a content type in Drupal, in essence, you're
creating a table in MySQL and setting the columns in MySQL. For this
example writing instruments site, let's create a content type for the
products. It will include the name and description, as well as a field
for storing a photograph of each product.
</p><p>
To create a content type, you need to do a few things. After logging
in to Drupal as an administrator, go to the Administration page. From
there, click the link for Structure. On the Structure page, click on
Content Types. On the Content Types page, click the Add content type
link. Incidentally, in the Drupal community, navigation to this page would
be described typically in a shorter method: Click on
Administration&rarr;Structure&rarr;Content Types&rarr;Add content type. This menu-tree method
generally is accompanied with an absolute path for the domain shown
within parentheses (for example, /admin/structure/types/add). From this
point on,
I use the shortened method.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11211f1.large.jpg"><img src="11211f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Content Type Add Fields
</p></div></div><p>
After you've opened the admin page for creating a content type (Figure 1),
in the Name field, enter &ldquo;Product&rdquo;. Leave
the rest, and click the button that reads &ldquo;Save and Add
Fields&rdquo;. On
the next page, you'll see a table with a few fields (for example, Title,
Body). Let's add a couple more for the site's specific needs. In
the Add new field section, type in the first box, &ldquo;Product
Image&rdquo;. For
the Name column, enter &ldquo;product_image&rdquo; (this creates a field in MySQL,
field_product_image). For the Field Type, select &ldquo;Image&rdquo; from the drop-down
list. Now click Save. On the next two screens, accept the defaults and
click the save buttons for each page.
</p><p>
Completion of the above will take you back to the table of fields for
Product. Now, let's add another field to indicate whether an item is a
pen or a pencil. Call it &ldquo;Product Type&rdquo;, and set the Field
Type to &ldquo;List
(text)&rdquo;, leaving the Widget set to Select List, so that when content
is entered later, you can select the product type from a list. This
time after you save, you'll see a form containing a field called,
&ldquo;Allowed values list&rdquo;. Enter in that field, on separate lines,
&ldquo;1|Pen&rdquo;
and &ldquo;2|Pencil&rdquo; (without the quotation marks). This is a key and value hash that
will become the available choices for users. Now save your way out,
accepting default settings. The field list should then look like the
screenshot shown in Figure 2. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11211f2.large.jpg"><img src="11211f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Product Type Manage Fields
</p></div></div><p>
You may want to experiment and add a few more fields (such as Price, Ink
Color and so on). Otherwise, you now can create products on the site. To make
things easier to understand, add a few pens and pencils. Search the Web
for photos of pens and pencils, and grab them so you'll have images to
go with the products you add. To enter products, go to
Administration&rarr;Content&rarr;Add content and click on the content type,
&ldquo;Product&rdquo;
(/node/add/product). If you make a mistake and want to change a
product after it's saved, or if you just want to see a list of products, go
to Administration&rarr;Content (/admin/content). There, select
the type, &ldquo;Product&rdquo;, and click Filter to show only products
(Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11211f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a1b580.0x2b140c0"></a>
Building Views</h2></div></div><p>
Each content entry that you create, you can access individually, as an
on-the-fly page, which are referred to as nodes. However, let's
also create a page that lists all of the products with links to these
nodes. To do this, you need to create a view. A view allows you to aggregate
and arrange content on a site, and to organize and group data based on
field values and other factors.
</p><p>
To create a view showing a list of pens and pencils, go to
Administration&rarr;Structure&rarr;Views, and then click on &ldquo;Add new
view&rdquo;
(/admin/structure/views/add). This displays a form (Figure 4)
for creating a page&mdash;one that draws data from MySQL
and generates a Web page when called.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11211f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Add New View
</p></div></div><p>
In the View Name field, enter &ldquo;Product List&rdquo;. In the section that begins
with Show, you can select the kind of view to create. For our purposes,
select &ldquo;Content&rdquo;. To the right of this, after the options update, you
may select the content type to show. Choose &ldquo;Product&rdquo; from the list. If
you hadn't noticed, this form is something of a wizard. Now change the
sorting method to &ldquo;Unsorted&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Next you have two check boxes: one for creating a page and another for
creating a block. Basically, pages in this sense are views and may be used
to generate standalone pages. Blocks are views that can display the same
information, but that may be used as components within other pages. Pages
are better at this point, so check &ldquo;Create a page&rdquo;.
</p><p>
In the section that opens for creating a page, type in a title for the
top of the page. Next enter the file path. The wizard provides the
domain name and leading slash. Just add the page name in the box as
&ldquo;product-list&rdquo;. This means that when people using a Web browser go
to http://domain_name.com/product-list, they will see the results of
the display. Next, you need to set the display format. For what's
to come, choose Grid of Fields. Ignore the other settings and click the
button, &ldquo;Continue &amp; Edit&rdquo; to tweak the view further.
</p><p>
In the Fields section, by default, the view creates a Title field. Let's
add at least two more fields. Click on the link &ldquo;add&rdquo; across from
the FIELDS label to add a field. This lists many fields that may be
added. Scan the list for &ldquo;Content: Product Type&rdquo;&mdash;that's the one for
choosing whether a product is a pen or pencil. When you find it, click
the check box next to it. Probably just above it, you will find &ldquo;Content:
Product Image&rdquo;. Check that as well. Then click the button at the bottom,
labeled &ldquo;Add and configure fields&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The fields configuration page opens for each of the fields you're
adding, one at a time. For the Product Type field, check the box that
says, &ldquo;Exclude from display&rdquo;, since it won't be necessary to display the
word Pen for each pen. Instead, let's use this field for grouping the
data. Now, click the Apply button. When you see the form for Product Image,
for style preferences, ensure that &ldquo;Create a label&rdquo; is unchecked. For the
Image Style, select &ldquo;thumbnail&rdquo; from the list and then click Apply. Your
page should look like the screenshot shown in Figure 5.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11211f5.large.jpg"><img src="11211f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Product List View
</p></div></div><p>
Now that you've added the Product Type field, you can use it for grouping
the products. To do this, in the Format section, next to the Grid link,
click on the link for its Settings. Near the top of the box that opens,
where it says &ldquo;Grouping field&rdquo;, choose &ldquo;Content: Product
Type&rdquo; from
the list. Enter 4 in the field for the number of columns and then click
Apply. The name of each item and its photo now appear in the display,
but each product is grouped based on whether it's a pen or a pencil. A
larger, bold-faced heading appears for each group. Click on the button
near the bottom labeled &ldquo;Update Preview&rdquo;, so that you can see the results
of the query in MySQL generated by the view.
</p><p>
By default, the view sorts the groups of products in descending
alphanumerical order, based on their Product Type headings. So, the
pencils display before the pens. Because there's more money in pens than
mechanical pencils, you might want to put pens first. You can reverse the
order by adding a Sort Criteria for &ldquo;Content: Product Type&rdquo; and setting
it to &ldquo;Sort ascending&rdquo;.
</p><p>
There's plenty more that you can do, but this is enough to get started. Click
the Save button at the top right. Then, check the results of your
efforts by opening the page that users will see (/product-lists).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11211f6.large.jpg"><img src="11211f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Product List Page
</p></div></div><p>
Notice in Figure 6 that the pens are grouped together,
separated from the mechanical pencils. Because I entered content entries for
four pens and four pencils for testing and set the number of columns
to four in the view, the results are showing only four of each in one
row. Had I entered eight pens, two rows of pens would show. The name of
each pen and pencil functions as a link to the node, which presents a
larger photo of the product, as well as all of the other information on
the pen and any other fields I may have added. You can adjust the view to
provide more information at this level. You also can have the links set
to go to a different page generated by the view. And, you can change the
formatting (that is, CSS using the CSS Injector module) to alter the colors
and layout, as well as choose a different theme for Drupal. However,
what I've done here demonstrates the basics of creating a content type
and a view to filter and organize the data for a particular content,
as well as how to display that data dynamically.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a1b580.0x2f0d3e8"></a>
Other Considerations: Taxonomy</h2></div></div><p>
Having explained the absolute basics of using Drupal to manage and display
data, I would be remiss in speaking on content types and views if I
did not also mention the advantages of the Taxonomy module. Taxonomy is
a property in which a vocabulary of related words are assembled. In the
example site, I'm using the Product Type field to differentiate between
different kinds of products available. This arrangement works fine
if all you have are two kinds of products and rarely change them,
but it proves cumbersome if the list of product types is long or were to
change occasionally.
</p><p>
For instance, instead of just pen, you may want to distinguish between
ball-point pens, felt-tip pens and fountain pens. You might want to have
wooden pencils and mechanical pencils instead of just a product type of
pencil. You may want to rearrange the ordering of the products so that
red felt-tip pens appear above blue ball-points, but do not overshadow
orange fountain pens. The more complex the list of product types, the
less feasible it becomes to handle them within a field in the content
type, and the more reasonable it becomes to adopt taxonomy instead.
</p><p>
The Taxonomy module allows you to create lists of custom values for use
in organizing your products. Unlike, the present Product Type field,
these values, called terms, provide more configuration options, allowing
you greater precision in adding and arranging new product types.
</p><p>
Terms do not exist on their own in Drupal. Instead, you create them in
lists called vocabularies. A vocabulary allows you to keep all related
terms together so that you can add them as possible values for content
types. Compared to the Product Type field in the example site,
&ldquo;Pen&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Pencil&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Allowed values list&rdquo; are terms, and collectively
these terms are a vocabulary.
</p><p>
To create a vocabulary, go to the
Administration&rarr;Structure&rarr;Taxonomy page, and click the &ldquo;Add
vocabulary&rdquo; link (/admin/structure/taxonomy/add). In the Name field,
enter &ldquo;Product Types&rdquo;,
then save. This returns you to the Taxonomy page, which has added an
entry for Product Types. To add terms to your vocabulary, click the
add terms link for Product Types. In the Name field, enter &ldquo;Fountain
Pen&rdquo;. Ignore the rest of the settings for now and click Save. The add
term form re-opens. Continue to add terms for different types of writing instruments.
</p><p>
In order to use these terms with the products, you must replace the
existing Product Type field with a new one that is linked to the new
vocabulary. Go back to the Content types page at
Administration&rarr;Structure&rarr;Content Types. On the listing for
Products, click its &ldquo;Manage
Fields&rdquo; link (/admin/structure/types/manage/product/fields). Click
the Delete link for Product Type field. Then re-create the Product Type
field, this time selecting &ldquo;Term reference&rdquo; for the Field column. On
the field configuration page, at the bottom, from the drop-down list
for Vocabulary select &ldquo;Product Types&rdquo;, and then save.
</p><p>
The Products content types will update with the new field. Although it
appears the same as the old field, the options available now are drawn
from the Taxonomy, providing easier control over their arrangement
and number.
</p><p>
Now that you have deleted the old Product Type field, the products list
view no longer groups results correctly by types of products. To restore
this feature, edit the Product List view to include the new field. Go
to Administration&rarr;Structure&rarr;Views (/admin/structure/views),
and click the Edit link for Product List. Then add the &ldquo;Content: Product
Type&rdquo; field using the previous configurations. Repeat the steps given
above to format your view, grouping products around the Product Type
field. Save when finished.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
You now should have a good sense of how to create content types and
how to manipulate them with a view to display data in simple ways with
Drupal 7. Now you can start creating your own Web sites and learn more
as you go. Compared to other methods of building Web sites, Drupal may
seem restrictive and awkward at first. However, in time, you will come
to see that it's powerful and works well in an organization with many
people of various technical backgrounds. Once you've developed a site,
nontechnical users can add and maintain content easily. Plus, as a
developer, with modules, you can add functionality easily with additional
modules. If you would like to learn more about Drupal 7, see <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_self">drupal.org</a>.
