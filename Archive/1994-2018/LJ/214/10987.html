There are myriad ways to describe the prolific Dr Stephen
Wolfram&mdash;inventor, author, groundbreaking scientist, IT CEO and
entrepreneur and
MacArthur Genius Grant recipient (also toss in Renaissance man to emphasize the
diversity of his achievements). Despite Wolfram's many laurels, there's a
fair chance you never have heard of him. This accomplished Briton, who has
lived most of his adult life here on American soil, developed Mathematica,
the world-standard technical computing package, and is refining the
ambitious Wolfram|Alpha computational knowledge engine, a long-term project
to make the world's knowledge computable and accessible to everyone.

Dr Stephen Wolfram
</p></div></div><p>
Before
Mathematica and Wolfram|Alpha, Wolfram published his first scientific paper
at age 15 and knocked out his PhD in theoretical physics from Caltech by
age
20. He's a man who seems to be living well ahead of his age as well as his
time.
</p><p>
Recently, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> caught up with Dr Stephen Wolfram to learn more
about this fascinating man and the important, cutting-edge work he
continues
to do.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span> Your &ldquo;computational knowledge
engine&rdquo; Wolfram|Alpha has been running 
for more than two years now. How has it been doing out in &ldquo;the real
world&rdquo;? 
And, are there any surprises regarding who is using it and how? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span> It was a difficult decision when to
first release Wolfram|Alpha. Eventually,
we just couldn't learn much more without seeing actual users using it. 
Watching that has been fascinating, and it has let us steadily make 
Wolfram|Alpha better. Our goal is to understand queries in whatever form a 
user chooses to give them&mdash;with no &ldquo;manual&rdquo;. We have a whole calculus of 
linguistic variation, but it's amazing all the strange forms people
actually 
use. These days though, we can understand more than 95% of queries the first
time, 
which I think is pretty good. 
</p><p>
As far as users and uses are concerned, I'm continually amazed at the 
diversity of people I run into who turn out to be avid Wolfram|Alpha users. 
We intended Wolfram|Alpha to become a very widespread tool, and that's 
steadily happening. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
A fellow thinker, Rudy Rucker, called Wolfram|Alpha a &ldquo;platonic search 
engine&rdquo;&mdash;one that unearths eternal truths that may never have been 
written down before. Is that an accurate observation? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
It's a nice description. At a practical level, I can say that these days 
the majority of queries people enter in Wolfram|Alpha get zero hits in a 
search engine. But we can handle them because we're computing answers 
afresh, not trying to find something someone happened to write down before. 
</p><p>
Sometimes the truths we compute are &ldquo;eternal&rdquo;, like the solution of a 
differential equation or the property of a polyhedron. But a lot of the 
time, they're dynamic. They are based on data that comes from the outside 
world, like the weather somewhere, or the price of a stock or the position 
of a spacecraft. And at some level, what starts as a philosophical issue 
about eternal truths ends up as a very practical issue for the
Wolfram|Alpha 
caching system. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
What is your long-term vision for Wolfram|Alpha? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span> I'd like to see as much of the world's knowledge as possible be 
computable, so that it can be used to answer whatever specific query one
might 
have. With the progress of technology, we've been able to automate so many 
things. But a lot of the achievements of our civilization are still 
encapsulated only in the knowledge of human experts. I'd like to automate 
using that knowledge and get to the point that any question that could be 
answered by a human expert based on accumulated knowledge and data can be 
answered automatically by Wolfram|Alpha. I think that kind of automation is 
going to let us humans get a lot further on many fronts. 
</p><p>
At an engineering level, Wolfram|Alpha gives us a whole new approach
that 
I call &ldquo;knowledge-based computing&rdquo;. We're used to the idea that software 
has to be built from raw computational primitives. But Wolfram|Alpha gives 
us a platform where we can in a sense start from the knowledge of the
world, 
and then build from that. The result is a major change in the economics of 
all sorts of software development, as well as making lots of new and 
sometimes unexpected things possible. We're seeing some of these things as 
Wolfram|Alpha extends from just being a Web site to supporting a whole 
ecosystem. 
</p><p>
As of right now, Wolfram|Alpha takes short textual queries and computes 
results from them. We're about to release a version that can take all sorts 
of other input&mdash;whether it's images or data files or programs. And we're 
going to see it not just compute results, but also cause things to happen. 
For example, last year we released a new version of Mathematica that uses 
Wolfram|Alpha to synthesize runnable programs from free-form linguistic
input. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
What have been your technical challenges regarding Wolfram|Alpha? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
I've done some pretty complex projects in my life, but I have to say that 
Wolfram|Alpha is outrageously more complex than any of the others. It's got 
an incredible number of different kinds of moving parts. 
</p><p>
We've got to get computable data about every kind of thing. We've built a 
pipeline for curating data that's a mixture of automation and expert human 
input. And even though we've handled thousands of domains now, it's amazing 
that almost every new one seems to have some new twist. And, to get it all 
right often requires talking to the world expert in that domain. 
</p><p>
After the data, we've got to actually implement all the methods and models 
and algorithms that are needed to compute useful things from that data. 
It's all done in Mathematica (which is what makes it possible), but by now 
Wolfram|Alpha is about 15 million lines of Mathematica code. 
</p><p>
Then there's the linguistic understanding, which at first I thought&mdash;based 
on the history of natural language processing (NLP)&mdash;might just be plain 
impossible. But the problem we're solving is sort of the inverse of the 
usual NLP problem, and particularly by using insights from an area of basic 
science that I've developed, we've been able to make incredible progress. 
</p><p>
There are issues with generating output too&mdash;automating aesthetic 
judgments and the architecture of information presentation. And then, of 
course, there's lots of supercomputer-style infrastructure that's needed to 
actually run the computations for Wolfram|Alpha. 
</p><p>
From a software-engineering point of view, we've made use of all the tools 
that we've developed during the past 25 years for Mathematica. These days, 
the tools are almost all written in the Mathematica language, and they do a 
really good job of automating building, testing and deployment. 
Wolfram|Alpha is an incredibly nontrivial system to monitor and test, but 
so far we've been pushing out new versions successfully every week ever 
since it launched. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
I imagine your development team for Wolfram|Alpha must be quite eclectic. 
Can you tell us a little bit about that team? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
Yes, it's a very eclectic team. On the data and algorithms side, we have 
experts in lots and lots of different fields. For the overall frameworks, I 
think the highest concentrations of backgrounds are physics and computer 
science. There's also a huge concentration&mdash;particularly in the linguistic 
algorithms area&mdash;of people who've worked on science based on my book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A New 
Kind of Science</em></span>. 
</p><p>
Wolfram|Alpha almost by definition requires incredible diversity of skills 
and knowledge. We've ended up having to keep a WhoKnowsWhat database at our 
company so we can quickly find who might happen to know about forestry, or 
Vietnamese character sets, or machine tools or whatever. 
</p><p>
It's also interesting that Wolfram|Alpha needs people with skills that I 
doubt have ever been defined before&mdash;for example, linguistic curation. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
As you look back on 25 years and eight versions of your original and flagship 
application, Mathematica, how would you assess its impact and importance in 
the world of technical computing? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
Before Mathematica, it was really rare for technical people to &ldquo;do their own 
computing&rdquo;. They usually had to have special
&ldquo;programmers&rdquo; who did it. 
Mathematica has made that unnecessary, and the result is that an awful lot 
of advances have been made. It's pretty satisfying to see how much has been 
discovered and invented through the years with Mathematica. Fields like 
experimental mathematics have pretty much been made possible by it. 
</p><p>
I'm not quite sure, but I think I probably coined the term &ldquo;technical 
computing&rdquo;&mdash;not that I like it very much. I have to say that I think we 
pretty much defined what &ldquo;technical computing&rdquo; should be.
Through the years, 
we've redefined it a few times, and I think that particularly as we bring 
Wolfram|Alpha and Mathematica together, we're going to see the most dramatic 
changes that have happened since we first released Mathematica. 
</p><p>
Even after 25 years though, the story of Mathematica is only just 
beginning. Through the years, I've slowly understood more and more that's 
possible on the basis of the fundamental ideas in Mathematica, like 
symbolic programming. We're now pretty much finished with the to-do lists 
that I had for Mathematica in the late 1980s, but now I realize there's so 
much more that's possible. 
</p><p>
Through the years, Mathematica has emerged as an incredibly strong platform
for 
algorithm-rich software development. We certainly use it very successfully 
for pretty much everything at our company, and of course, it's the basis for 
Wolfram|Alpha. It's used in plenty of other organizations too, but we're 
building some things now that I suspect will make it a lot more widespread 
in the future. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
Can you share some interesting insights about Mathematica that would 
interest our technical readers? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
At a technical level, the core of Mathematica is its symbolic programming 
language. And, that language is based on one big idea: that 
everything&mdash;whether it's data, documents, programs, interfaces, 
whatever&mdash;can be represented in a very uniform way, as a symbolic 
expression. And because of that unification, it's possible to have a fairly 
small number of very powerful primitives that give a vast amount of 
functionality. 
</p><p>
In terms of scope, we've had a pretty simple principle: just implement
every 
definite algorithm we can. At the beginning, we emphasized things that would 
often be classified as &ldquo;math&rdquo;, but we long ago expanded far,
far, beyond 
that. Whether it's image processing, or control theory, or network 
analysis or text processing, if there are useful algorithms, they're 
probably in Mathematica. 
</p><p>
A strong principle in developing Mathematica has been to automate as much
as 
possible. The humans say what they want to achieve; it's up to Mathematica 
to figure out which algorithm to use, or whatever, to achieve that. We've 
also worked very hard to keep the design of Mathematica as coherent and 
consistent as possible. And, the result of all this is that in a sense we 
get to build Mathematica with bigger and bigger bricks. Each new piece of 
functionality finds it easy to use larger and larger chunks of existing 
functionality. 
</p><p>
We've done a lot of work on both system design and software engineering
during 
the years, and it's increasingly been paying off. So if you look, for 
example, at a plot of the number of functions supported by Mathematica 
versus time, it has a pretty impressive, perhaps exponentially looking form 
in recent years. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
To what extent did Mathematica inspire and inform Wolfram|Alpha? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
Well, of course, at a practical level, Wolfram|Alpha is implemented in the 
Mathematica language. It's all Mathematica. And if we hadn't had 
Mathematica, Wolfram|Alpha never would have been possible. 
</p><p>
We use Mathematica for all its built-in algorithms, but more important,
we 
use it as an incredibly powerful language for representing knowledge and 
defining new algorithms. We also use it as a large-scale deployment 
environment&mdash;actually delivering the computations and results from 
Wolfram|Alpha on the Web and elsewhere. And, needless to say, all our 
software engineering and testing and monitoring systems are written in 
Mathematica too. 
</p><p>
In a sense, Mathematica and Wolfram|Alpha are conceptual opposites. 
Mathematica is based on a very clean and precise language that can be used 
to build very large structures. Wolfram|Alpha has to handle all the 
messiness of the world, and of human language, and initially is used mainly 
for one-shot queries. 
</p><p>
For me, it was very interesting to think about Wolfram|Alpha after so many 
years of working on Mathematica. I could, in a sense, do everything exactly 
the opposite way. But, now it's really exciting to see how these different 
approaches can be brought together, so in the latest version of 
Mathematica, we use Wolfram|Alpha technology to let people enter free-form 
natural language inputs and get precise Mathematica code out. 
</p><p>
It's pretty interesting. It's a new way to do programming&mdash;just by using 
natural language. And, I am frankly quite surprised at how well it already 
works, and how useful even I, as an expert Mathematica programmer, find it. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
Unlike many software developers, you've had your application Mathematica 
available on the Linux platform for years. When did the first Linux version 
arrive, and what motivated Wolfram Research to be such an early Linux
supporter? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
I just looked at my e-mail archive, and I see that the first internal 
discussion about Linux at our company happened in 1993, and we started 
the actual port of Mathematica to Linux in late 1994. I'd have to read 
through lots of messages in my e-mail archive to remember exactly how the 
discussion about Linux went. But in general, it's been our principle ever 
since the beginning that we want Mathematica to be available on as many 
platforms as possible. 
</p><p>
It's good we have a well-developed Linux version of Mathematica, because 
nowadays all our Wolfram|Alpha servers are running Linux! 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
Could Wolfram|Alpha or Mathematica benefit from a model similar to
open-source software&mdash;that is, with a distributed group of contributors to
complement 
your core development teams? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
In Mathematica, we use lots and lots of open-source software these days. In 
fact, all the acknowledgements for it are getting to be the length of a 
small book. It's wonderful when we can use a strong piece of open-source 
software for an algorithm or a component. It lets us put more effort into 
the unique parts of the Mathematica system, like algorithm automation and 
its overall design. 
</p><p>
In Wolfram|Alpha, we have an increasingly large volunteer program, with 
people around the world helping us with particular data curation tasks that 
they're interested in. We're also thinking about how to develop open 
projects and collaborations to work on very large-scale data projects that 
we think would be good for the world, but which we can't afford to do
ourselves.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
You and [the late] Steve Jobs went way back. How did that relationship come
about?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
Steve Jobs was working in stealth mode on the NeXT computer. It must have 
been 1987. We met through a chain of acquaintances and ended up making a 
deal to have Mathematica bundled on every NeXT machine sold. It was 
actually the first major deal we made for Mathematica. And Steve Jobs was 
also the person who pushed me to use the name &ldquo;Mathematica&rdquo; instead of 
various alternatives. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
You were the youngest person ever to win the MacArthur
&ldquo;Genius&rdquo;
 Grant/Award. 
What did you win it for? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
I got that award in 1981. When Rod MacArthur (son of the late John 
MacArthur) called me to tell me about it, I actually asked what it was for, 
and he said they didn't ever specifically say that. So I guess I don't 
specifically know. 
</p><p>
I can say that in 1981, I was 21 years old, and I had mainly worked on two 
things. First, starting when I was 14, I had published all sorts of papers 
in theoretical physics&mdash;mainly about particle physics and about cosmology. 
I'd also become very involved in using computers to automate the 
calculations I needed to do. And starting in 1979, I'd been developing a 
symbolic manipulation software system that was in some ways a forerunner of 
Mathematica. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
From the outside, it appears that you are a person who is living the way
 he 
wishes without much compromise. Is that observation accurate? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
It's certainly what I aspire to, and I've spent a lot of effort doing my 
best to get myself into that position. 
</p><p>
Of course, I've made plenty of choices. For example, I could work on things 
that are somehow maximally intellectual, but don't have practical 
significance and don't make money. Or I could try to make the maximum 
amount of money, but work on things that are intellectually rather dull. 
I've chosen a middle path, which I'm pretty happy with. I get to do lots of 
very fascinating things, but they're useful enough that they've let me 
make a very decent amount of money, which gives me the freedom to go on 
doing interesting things. 
</p><p>
I've spent years building up Wolfram Research and collecting lots of very 
brilliant people there who I enjoy working with. I've never taken the 
company public or had investors. So I've been able to concentrate on 
long-term things that I think are really interesting (like Mathematica and 
Wolfram|Alpha). And I also don't get fired as CEO when I spend years 
working on basic science. (Although actually that basic science has now 
turned out to be crucial to our products too, but that's a different
story.) 
My theory is that having Wolfram Research is the best way I can turn ideas 
that I care about into real things in the world. 
</p><p>
I've been a remote CEO for more than 20 years now, working at home most of 
the time. I've ended up using technology to make my work as efficient as 
possible. I figure that whatever I can automate and make routine, I don't 
have to think about. So I can spend my thinking effort on the stuff that's 
really worth thinking about. And that I really enjoy. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
From a young age, you've been ahead of your time, regularly producing 
innovations in mathematics, science and computing that typically come from 
someone ten or 20 years older, if ever. What can you tell us about what 
is going on internally&mdash;your thoughts, impulses, philosophy and so
on&mdash;that 
would help us understand how you've managed to be so ahead of your time 
all of your life? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
Thanks for the kind words! I guess I like to understand things at the most 
fundamental level possible, and when I succeed in doing that, it often 
seems fairly obvious to me what direction the things should go in. It's 
been very common in my life that I think about doing something, and then a 
decade or two later it becomes very popular. 
</p><p>
I think I achieve the most by doing large long-term projects (although I find 
it a lot of fun to do the occasional short project), but one doesn't get to 
do that many large projects in a lifetime. One has to pick and choose. I 
like to pick ones that I think won't get done as part of the general 
development of things&mdash;ones where I can feel I'm making a unique 
contribution by doing them. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
Readers of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> tend to be &ldquo;outside the
box&rdquo; kind of people. (We 
think you'd fit right in!) Do you have any advice for any budding Stephen 
Wolframs out there&mdash;people who have great ideas and want to make important 
contributions to their field, but aren't sure how to proceed? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
I think the first thing is to have confidence. Figure things out as best 
you can for yourself&mdash;perhaps asking lots of people for advice
too&mdash;then 
stick to what you've concluded. At any given time, there's always a 
conventional wisdom about how things should be done or what's possible. If 
you believe something different, go with what you believe. You always 
can define success to be whatever it is that you achieve. 
</p><p>
I happen to find people really interesting (a great asset if you're trying 
to build a company like ours!), and I've worked with lots and lots of
people 
who've done great things. My main conclusion is that there are an awful lot 
of different ways to achieve things. For any given person, it's important 
to understand yourself as well as you can. Even after all these years, I 
gradually understand myself better and better, and every increment in 
understanding seems to help me a lot in managing to do the right things. 
</p><p>
It's a fascinating problem matching people (including oneself) with the
best 
possible directions and niches in the world. It's amazing how often people 
get stuck in the wrong niches&mdash;sometimes because they just didn't know or 
understand other niches that would be much better for them, and sometimes 
because they think they have too much investment in one niche and can't
see 
how to bridge to another. My observation (for myself and others) is that 
with sufficient creativity, one always can come up with a strategy to get 
from here to there, and the result is much more satisfaction, fun and 
productivity. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JG:</b></span>
Do you have more big initiatives up your sleeve, or are you content right 
now to focus on Mathematica and Wolfram|Alpha? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SW:</b></span>
I've done three large projects so far in my life: Mathematica, <span   class="emphasis"><em>A New Kind
of 
Science</em></span> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>NKS</em></span>) and Wolfram|Alpha. They're all never-ending projects, and I
hope 
to go on pursuing all of them forever, but I also hope to do some more big 
projects. 
</p><p>
I have quite a long list of projects I'd like to do, mostly very large and 
ambitious. The big challenge is to pick the right time to do them. I'd 
been thinking about the general idea of Wolfram|Alpha for several decades, 
but always had decided it was too early to try actually doing it. One has 
to wait until the ambient technology is to the right point. Some of the 
projects I'm considering may be close; some may be 50 years away. 
</p><p>
One project I'm committed to doing is to use the work I've done in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A New 
Kind of Science</em></span> to try to find a truly fundamental theory of physics. I'm 
ready to dive into that project, but right now, the amazing collection of 
opportunities around Wolfram|Alpha are keeping me far too busy. 
</p><p>
There are also some very, very interesting technology projects that are made 
possible by <span   class="emphasis"><em>NKS</em></span>; I just have to figure out when is the right decade to
start 
them. I often think about projects for decades before I actually dive into 
doing them. But it's always exciting when a new project gets going, and 
one starts seeing how something can be created from nothing. It's always a 
great experience, both for me and for the people I'm working with. 
</p><p>

important work!
