A once-hot category is now down to just Google.

Blogging was born in the late 1990s, and it got hot after the turn of the
millennium. Several characteristics made blogs distinctive. First,
they were personal. Second, they consisted of posts organized in
reverse chronological order: the latest stuff on top, the older stuff
scrolling toward the bottom. Third, each post had its own URL, called a
permalink, which survived with its own archival path after it scrolled
off the current page. Fourth, with the advent of RSS (Really Simple
Syndication), blogs had a journalistic advantage: notifying the world
that a post had just gone up. Thus, blogs were more current and live
than ordinary Web sites, and they were designed to accumulate a corpus of work that
respected the future by organizing and preserving the past.
</p><p>
By contrast, ordinary Web sites tended to be static and have no
archival function. This was especially true of commercial sites. Last
year's shoes were as gone as last year's snow.
</p><p>
Google and other search engines of the time paid little attention
to blogs. They assumed that the Web was more like real estate than
like anything that was alive and constantly changing. &ldquo;Sites&rdquo; that were
&ldquo;designed&rdquo;, &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; or &ldquo;built&rdquo;
at &ldquo;locations&rdquo; you could &ldquo;visit&rdquo;
or &ldquo;browse&rdquo; mattered more than &ldquo;journals&rdquo; that
were &ldquo;posted&rdquo;, &ldquo;updated&rdquo;
and &ldquo;syndicated&rdquo;.
</p><p>
That left open a hole in the marketplace for search engines that indexed
the live Web, leaving the static one to Google and its direct
competitors.
</p><p>
The first blog search engine was PubSub, which showed up sometime in 2002.
It was inventive and took some getting used to, but it was fast and did
a good job of finding current postings in the blogosphere.
</p><p>
Second was Technorati, which came along in late 2002, out of
research David Sifry and I were doing for the article &ldquo;Building
with Blogs&rdquo;, which ran in March 2003 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6497" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6497</a>). The first incarnation
of Technorati was a MySQL hack that ran on a Debian box in the basement
of David's San Francisco apartment. When he exposed it to the public on
the Web, it was an instant success. Not long after that, David quit his
day job and worked on building Technorati full-time.
</p><p>
Third was Bloglines, which came along in early 2003. Bloglines was a
Web-based RSS news aggregator, rather than a search engine in the usual
sense. Still, it served the need for readers to know what was being
published right now on the Web.
</p><p>
During the next several years, other fish in the blog-search pond came to
include Google Blog Search, BlogPulse, Yahoo, Feedster, IceRocket and Blogdigger.
</p><p>
After a while fake blogs&mdash;a form of spam Mark Cuban called
&ldquo;splogs&rdquo;&mdash;came to comprise about 99% of the blogs in the
world. This was a huge problem that even Google had trouble keeping
up with. Thanks to the splog issue and other problems, Feedster and
Blogdigger died off. Yahoo never was serious about blog search and
quit the game. IceRocket and BlogPulse both were sold and now
are mostly buzz search engines that don't remember anything more than a
few months old. Blogdigger's page still is up but doesn't do anything.
And Technorati, which once maintained a complete index of all syndicated
sources, including all blogs from the beginning of the company's
existence, turned into one of those &ldquo;content&rdquo; mills several years back.
</p><p>
The only true blog search engine still operating is Google Blog Search,
which basically is a specialized search in Google's main engine, which
has been modified in recent years to reduce time-to-index to minutes
or even seconds. I hope it keeps going, because it's an essential
resource for finding the kind of news that's syndicated live, still
curates itself, and isn't just about pushing or riding whatever happens
to be buzzing at the moment.
</p><p>
For a while after Technorati gave up, my favorite blog search engine
was IceRocket. Now owned by Meltwater Buzz, it's about &ldquo;social media
monitoring&rdquo; that &ldquo;helps you mine conversations across social channels
for nuggets of insight&rdquo;. Note that the second-person
&ldquo;you&rdquo; is not you
and me, the users. We're the producers of ore from which insight nuggets
are mined. The &ldquo;you&rdquo; they're talking to is advertisers.
</p><p>
This is what Twitter hath wrought, and Facebook
as well. They've buried
real news&mdash;stuff worth keeping around&mdash;under a mountain of buzz,
all of which melts away after minutes, weeks or months.
</p><p>
But the durable stuff still matters. Journalism, compromised and corrupted
as it has become, still matters&mdash;perhaps more than ever. That means
blogs, and journals like this one, still matter too. But only to the
degree that the work still can be found.
