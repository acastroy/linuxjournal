Rails isn't the only open-source Web framework in town.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218d580.0x2285250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Catalyst is the latest in the evolution of open-source Web development
frameworks. Written in modern Perl and inspired by many of the projects
that came before it, including Ruby on Rails, Catalyst is elegant, powerful
and refined. It's a great choice for creating any Web-based application
from the simple to the very complex.
</p><p>
Like many other popular Perl-based projects, Catalyst has a strong focus on
flexibility and choice. Catalyst is especially powerful because it provides
an abundance of features and the core environment, structure and
interfaces on which virtually anything can be built without forcing you to
do things in any particular way.
</p><p>
Writing applications in Catalyst is fast too. Just because you can tackle
any aspect of application design yourself, doesn't mean you have to.
Catalyst provides a wide array of refined, high-level, drop-in solutions to
all kinds of problems and needs without limiting access to the nuts and bolts.
Templating, ORM, authentication, automatic session management and all the
other high-level features you'd want from a Web framework are available in
Catalyst&mdash;and more.
</p><p>
Catalyst's approach is to provide these high-level features as optional
plugins and modules. This is one of the greatest strengths of Perl&mdash;a
tremendous number of refined modules and libraries are available. So,
instead of re-inventing all this functionality, Catalyst provides a
framework to bring together seamlessly what already exists. 
</p><p>
Catalyst is bigger than itself&mdash;it is also everything that's available in
CPAN. That alone makes it one of the most feature-rich frameworks there
are.
</p><p>
In this article, I provide an introduction to Catalyst and how to use it
for rapid application development. I cover the basics of how to
create and lay out a new application as well as how to write the actions
that will handle requests. I explain how to define flexible URL dispatch
logic and some of the APIs that are available. I focus on the
fundamentals, but I cover some of the popular available components as well, such as Template::Toolkit. I also talk about how you can
extend Catalyst itself, and how you can deploy an application with Apache.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218d580.0x2285618"></a>
Background Knowledge and the MVC Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
Catalyst and Catalyst applications are written in Perl, so some basic Perl
knowledge is necessary to use Catalyst effectively. You also should have
some experience with object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes,
methods, inheritance and so on.
</p><p>
Like Rails, Django, CakePHP and many other Web frameworks, Catalyst follows
the venerable Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. MVC is a
proven approach to structuring and segmenting application code for
efficiency, flexibility and maintainability. 
</p><p>
Plenty of tutorials and resources are available for MVC, so
I won't spend too much time covering it here. If you've 
worked with other Web frameworks, chances are you're already familiar with
MVC. If not, the most important thing to understand is that it is more
about best practices than anything else.
</p><p>
The focus of this article is to explain the core details of how Catalyst
operates, but since Catalyst made most of its layout decisions according to
MVC, you'll still see it along the way. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218d580.0x2285828"></a>
Getting Catalyst</h2></div></div><p>
Before you can install Catalyst on your system, you obviously need Perl.
Most Linux distros already have Perl installed out of the box, but if not,
install it with your package manager.
</p><p>
Catalyst itself is a Perl library that you can install with cpan:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cpan Catalyst::Devel
</pre>
</p><p>
The previous command installs Catalyst with development tools along with
its many dependencies. For production/hosting systems that will run
only applications without the need for development tools, you can install the
smaller Catalyst::Runtime bundle instead.
</p><p>
Because Catalyst has so many dependencies, it can take quite a while to
install on a fresh system. By default, CPAN asks if it should install each
dependency individually, which can become redundant really quick. You can
configure CPAN not to ask, but instead, I usually just cheat by holding
down Enter for a few seconds to queue up a bunch of default (&ldquo;yes, install
the module!&rdquo;) keystroke/answers.
</p><p>
If the install fails on the first attempt, don't fret. Whatever the problem
may be, it probably will be explained in the scrollback along with what to
do to solve it. Typically, this involves nothing more than
installing/upgrading another module that wasn't automatically in the
dependency tree for whatever reason, or just running the
<tt  >cpan</tt> command a
second time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218d580.0x2285b98"></a>
Catalyst Application Layout</h2></div></div><p>
Every Catalyst application is a Perl module/library/bundle&mdash;exactly like
the modules on CPAN. This consists of a package/class namespace and
standard structure of files and directories. The Catalyst::Devel package
comes with a helper script to create new &ldquo;skeleton&rdquo; applications and to
initialize the files and directories for you. For example, to create a new
application called KillerApp, run the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
catalyst.pl KillerApp
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates a new application structure at KillerApp/ with the
following subdirectories:
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>lib/:</b></span> this is the Perl include directory
that stores all the Perl
classes (aka packages or modules) for the application. This is added to
the Perl lib path at runtime, and the directory structure corresponds to the
package/class namespaces. For example, the two classes that are initially
created have the following namespaces and corresponding file paths:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
KillerApp &mdash; lib/KillerApp.pm
</p></li><li><p>
KillerApp::Controller::Root &mdash; lib/KillerApp/Controller/Root.pm 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
These directories also are created but initially are empty:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
lib/KillerApp/Model/
</p></li><li><p>
lib/KillerApp/View/
</p></li></ul></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>root/:</b></span> this is where other kinds application-specific files are
stored. Static Web files, such as images, CSS and JavaScript go in the
subdirectory static, which usually is exposed as the URL /static. Other
kinds of files go in here too, such as templates.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>script/:</b></span> this contains application-specific scripts, including the
development server (killerapp_server.pl) that you can use to run the
application in its own standalone Web server, as well as scripts to deploy
the application in a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Web server. The helper script
killerapp_create.pl creates new model, view and controller component
classes.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>t/:</b></span> this is where &ldquo;tests&rdquo; go. If you follow a test-driven
development process, for every new feature you write, you also will write an
automated test case. Tests let you quickly catch regressions that may be
introduced in the future. Writing them is a good habit to get into, but
that's
beyond the scope of this article.
</p><p>
The created skeleton application is already fully functional, and you can
run it using the built-in test server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd KillerApp/
script/killerapp_server.pl
</pre>
</p><p>
This fires up the app in its own dedicated Web server on port 3000. Open
http://localhost:3000/ to see the default front page, which initially
displays the Catalyst welcome message.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218d580.0x22865e8"></a>
The Request/Response Cycle</h2></div></div><p>
All Web applications handle requests and generate responses. The
fundamental job of any Web framework/platform/environment is to provide a
useful structure to manage this process. Although there are different ways of
going about this&mdash;from elegant MVC applications to ugly, monolithic CGI
scripts&mdash;ultimately, they're all doing the same basic thing:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Decide what to call when a request comes in.
</p></li><li><p>
Supply an API for generating the response.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In Catalyst, this happens in special methods called &ldquo;actions&rdquo;. On every
request, Catalyst identifies one or more actions and calls them with
special arguments, including a reference to the &ldquo;context&rdquo;
object that
provides a convenient and practical API through which everything else is
accomplished.
</p><p>
Actions are contained within classes called &ldquo;controllers&rdquo;, which live in a
special path/namespace in the application (lib/KillerApp/Controller/). The
skeleton application sets up one controller (&ldquo;Root&rdquo;), but you can create
more with the helper script. For example, this creates a new
controller class KillerApp::Controller::Something: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
script/killerapp_create.pl controller Something
</pre>
</p><p>
The only reason to have more than one controller is for organization; you
can put all your actions in the Root controller with no loss of features or
ability. Controllers are just the containers for actions.
</p><p>
In the following sections, I describe how Catalyst decides which actions
to call on each request (&ldquo;dispatch&rdquo;) and then explain how to use the
supplied context object within them. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218d580.0x2286c18"></a>
Dispatch</h2></div></div><p>
Catalyst provides a particularly flexible and powerful mechanism for
configuring dispatch rules. Rather than having a separate configuration to
assign URLs to specific actions, Catalyst uses the actions themselves to
determine URL mappings dynamically.
</p><p>
Each action definition (which is just a Perl subroutine) represents not
only a block of code, but also what URL paths apply to it. This is specified in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>subroutine attributes</em></span>&mdash;a lesser-known Perl feature that provides
arbitrary labels that can be used for introspection. 
</p><p>
Catalyst supports a handful of parameterized attributes to determine the URL
path to action mappings in a variety ways. 
For example, the following action has an absolute path set using the
<tt  >:Path</tt> attribute: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub myaction :Path('/some/place') {
        my ( $self, $c, @args ) = @_;
        # do stuff...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Regardless of what controller you put it in, the above action would map to
all URLs starting with /some/place (http://localhost:3000/some/place with
the development server).
</p><p>
If you omitted the starting slash and used
<tt  >:Path('some/place')</tt>, the action
would map to a path relative to the namespace of the controller. For
example, if it were in <tt  >KillerApp::Controller::Foobar</tt>, it would be mapped
to URL paths starting with /foobar/some/place.
</p><p>
Instead of using <tt  >:Path</tt> to set the path explicitly,
you can set <tt  >:Local</tt> to
use the name of the controller and method. For instance, the following
action, if contained in the controller
<tt  >KillerApp::Controller::Some</tt>, would
also map to /some/place:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub place :Local {
        my ( $self, $c, @args ) = @_;
        # do stuff...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
If it were contained in the controller
<tt  >KillerApp::Controller::Some::Other</tt>, it would map to /some/other/place.
</p><p>
Actions include subpaths by default, so the above also would match
/some/other/place/blah/foo/1. When this happens, the leftover parts of the
path are supplied as arguments to the action method ('blah','foo','1'). You
can use the <tt  >:Args</tt> attribute to limit how deep the action will match subpaths, if at all. With an Args value of 0, this action would match only
/some/place, but nothing below it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub myaction :Path('/some/place') :Args(0) {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
        # do stuff...
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Other attributes are available too. <tt  >:Global</tt> works
like <tt  >:Local</tt> but
ignores the controller name, and path pattern matching can be done with
<tt  >:Regex</tt> and <tt  >:LocalRegex</tt>.
</p><p>
When a URL matches more than one action, Catalyst picks the one that
matches best. However, there are a few built-in actions (method names
&ldquo;begin&rdquo;, &ldquo;end&rdquo; and &ldquo;auto&rdquo;) that, if defined, are called at various stages
of every request in addition to the matched action. Using the advanced
<tt  >:Chained</tt> attribute type, you can configure additional/multiple actions to
be called with single requests in any order you like.
</p><p>
You also can programmatically dispatch to other action/paths from within
the action code itself:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub myaction :Path('/some/place') {
        my ( $self, $c, @args ) = @_;
        $c-&gt;forward('/some/other/place');
}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218d580.0x267fa18"></a>
The Context Object (<tt  >$c</tt>)</h2></div></div><p>
Controller actions serve as entry points to application code. A special
per-request object called the &ldquo;context&rdquo; is supplied as an argument to every
action when it is called by the dispatcher. The context object typically
is read into a variable named <tt  >$c</tt>, but it could be called anything. 
</p><p>
The context provides interfaces and information about the application and
its current state. It contains the details of the request currently being
processed (<tt  >$c-&gt;request</tt>) and access to what will become the response
(<tt  >$c-&gt;response</tt>). 
</p><p>
At the beginning of the request, before any actions are called, the
response object is created with empty/default data. Each of the actions
that are called then has an opportunity to manipulate the response. At the
end of the request, its final state is sent back to the client. This
iterative approach to generating the response lends itself to a modular and
dynamic structure.
</p><p>
The following action illustrates a few of the simple APIs that are
available, such as inspecting the User-Agent and query/post parameters in
the request, and setting the body and headers of the response:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sub myaction :Path('/some/place')  {
     my ( $self, $c, @args ) = @_;
	
     my $myparam = $c-&gt;request-&gt;params-&gt;{myparam};
	
     if(defined $myparam) {
          $c-&gt;response-&gt;body("myparam is $myparam");
     }
     else {
          $c-&gt;response-&gt;body("myparam was not supplied!!");
     }
	
     $c-&gt;response-&gt;body( 
          $c-&gt;response-&gt;body . 
          "\n\nExtra path args: " . join('/',@args)
     ) if (@args &gt; 0);
	
     $c-&gt;response-&gt;headers-&gt;header( 'Content-Type' =&gt; 'text/plain' );
	
     $c-&gt;response-&gt;body("Bad command or file name") 
          if ($c-&gt;request-&gt;user_agent =~ /MSIE/);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Accessing the URL http://localhost:3000/some/place/boo/baz?myparam=foo
would display the text that follows (except when using IE, in which case
&ldquo;Bad command or file name&rdquo; is displayed instead):

<pre     class="programlisting">
myparam is foo

Extra path args: boo/baz
</pre>
</p><p>
Within the action code, you can write any logic you like to build your
application. Because the context object is just a variable, you can pass it
as an argument into other functions. Following normal Perl programming
rules, you can use other classes and libraries, instantiate objects and so
on. 
</p><p>
This is the extent of what you <span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> to do&mdash;write controller actions
and use the context object&mdash;but it's only the beginning of what you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> do.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218d580.0x26800f8"></a>
Catalyst Components</h2></div></div><p>
Over and above the core functionality, Catalyst provides a robust MVC
structure to build your application. This includes useful base classes,
sensible default behaviors and helpful sugar functions. You can leverage a
tremendous amount of turnkey functionality by creating your classes within
the supplied framework as models, views and controllers.
</p><p>
All these are considered &ldquo;components&rdquo; within Catalyst, and there aren't
actually many functional differences between them. The
Model-View-Controller monikers primarily are used for the purpose of
categorization. Models are meant to contain data and business logic; views
are supposed to handle rendering and display; and controllers tie
everything together.
</p><p>
Operationally, components are essentially application classes with some
extra, Catalyst-specific functionally. They are loaded automatically at
startup as static object instances. Any component can be accessed
throughout the application via the context object:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub myaction :Path('/some/place') {
        my ( $self, $c, @args ) = @_;
        $c-&gt;model('MyModel')-&gt;do_something;
        $c-&gt;forward( $c-&gt;view('MyView') );
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example action, you simply are calling the method
<tt  >do_something</tt> in a model named
<tt  >MyModel</tt> (KillerApp::Model::MyModel), and
then <tt  >forward</tt> to the view named
<tt  >MyView</tt> (KillerApp::View::MyView).
</p><p>
Earlier, I showed how to use <tt  >forward</tt> to dispatch to another action by
supplying a path. When you pass a component to
<tt  >forward</tt>, the <tt  >process</tt>
method of the supplied component is called as if it were a controller
action, which is roughly equivalent to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$c-&gt;view('MyView')-&gt;process($c,@args);
</pre>
</p><p>
These are just a few examples of the available conventions and shortcuts.
The important thing to understand is that all these sugar
functions just boil down to calling methods and normal program flow.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218d580.0x2680780"></a>
Template::Toolkit Views</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most common needs of a Web application is a templating system
for rendering content. Templates probably are the best all-around approach
to rendering text-based content, especially for markup like HTML.
</p><p>
Catalyst can use multiple Perl template systems,
but the
most popular is Template::Toolkit&mdash;a powerful, general-purpose
template-processing system that is fast and feature-rich. It has a versatile and
robust syntax that is simple and easy to use, but it also supports advanced
capabilities, such as control structures, stream processing and extendability.
Template::Toolkit is a whole programming language in its own right. 
</p><p>
Catalyst provides a drop-in interface to Template::Toolkit via the
view/component class Catalyst::View::TT. You can create a view within your
application that extends this class using the helper script. Run this to
create a new view named &ldquo;HTML&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">
script/killerapp_create.pl view HTML TT
</pre>
</p><p>
The new view is fully functional out of the box. As a general-purpose
wrapper around Template::Toolkit, it provides a simple API to select
templates and supply input data. The rest of the view-specific code goes in
the templates themselves, which are stored within &ldquo;root&rdquo; in your application
directory. 
</p><p>
Here is an example of a simple Template::Toolkit template to render an HTML
page:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;[% title %]&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Message: [% message %]&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The character sequences within [%  %] are &ldquo;directives&rdquo;&mdash;snippets of code
that get replaced when the template is processed. The directives above are
simple variable substitutions, which are the most basic kind. In this case,
the values supplied for <tt  >title</tt> and
<tt  >message</tt> will be inserted when the
template is rendered.
</p><p>
If you saved the above template in a file named main.tt within
root/templates, for example, you could use it with an action like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sub myaction :Path('/some/place') :Args(0) {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
	
        $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{template} = 'templates/main.tt';
        $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{data}-&gt;{title} = 'TT rendered page';
        $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{data}-&gt;{message} = 'A cool message!';
	
        $c-&gt;forward( $c-&gt;view('HTML') );
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >stash</tt> object above is another built-in feature of Catalyst that I
haven't covered so far. It isn't very complicated; it's simply a hashref
within the context object. It provides a standard per-request place to
share data across components, similar to request and response, but for
general use. 
</p><p>
Catalyst::View::TT-based views use the content of the stash to determine
operation. The value of <tt  >template</tt> identifies the
template to call, and the
stash as a whole is used as the input data&mdash;each key in the stash becomes a
variable in the template. The content generated from processing the
template is used to set the body of the response.
</p><p>
The data in a real application probably will be more complex than the
simple key/values in the previous example. One of
Template::Toolkit's great features is its ability to handle Perl data structures directly.
Consider the following action:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub myaction :Path('/some/place') :Args(0) {
        my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
	
        $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{template} = 'templates/main.tt';
	
        $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{data} = {
                title	=&gt; 'TT rendered page',
                subhash =&gt; {
                        alpha =&gt; 'foo',
                        bravo =&gt; 'abdc',
                        charlie =&gt; 'xyz'
                },
                thinglist =&gt; [
                        'Thing 1',
                        'Thing 2',
                        'Big thing',
                        'Small thing'
                ]
        };
	
        $c-&gt;forward( $c-&gt;view('HTML') );
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This would work with a template like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;[% data.title %]&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Alpha:&lt;/b&gt; [% data.subhash.alpha %]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Bravo:&lt;/b&gt; [% data.subhash.bravo %]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Charlie:&lt;/b&gt; [% data.subhash.charlie %]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;List of Things:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[% FOREACH item IN data.thinglist %]
        [% item %]&lt;br&gt;
[% END %]
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Objects also can be supplied and accessed in the same manner as hashes. In
fact, the context object is supplied automatically in &ldquo;c&rdquo;. For example, if
you want to display the client's IP address, instead of separately putting
<tt  >$c-&gt;request-&gt;address</tt> in the stash, you can just access it directly within
the template like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[% c.request.address %]
</pre>
</p><p>
Template::Toolkit has many more features and abilities, including wrappers,
conditional statements, filters, function calls and so on.
Catalyst::View::TT also has additional defaults and configuration options
that I didn't cover here (see the documentation for more details).
</p><p>
It is totally up to you how to balance logic between the templates and the
rest of your application. Depending on what you are trying to achieve, your
application easily could be written more in Template::Toolkit than in Perl!

DBIx::Class Models</h2></div></div><p>
One of the other most common needs of an application is a database.
DBIx::Class (often shortened to DBIC) has emerged as the most popular ORM
(Object Relational Mapper) library available for Perl. It is an
exceptionally powerful, robust, object-oriented interface to many
relational database servers (including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MSSQL and
many others). 
</p><p>
Like Template::Toolkit, but to an even greater degree, Catalyst provides
refined, drop-in component wrappers to interface with DBIx::Class
(Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema).
</p><p>
Using DBIx::Class is a whole topic in and of itself that I don't have
space to cover here, but it is a must-have if you plan to integrate your
application with a database. See Resources for information on where to go to start
learning about this wonderful library.

Plugins and Application-Wide Settings</h2></div></div><p>
Besides pre-built component classes for drop-in functionality, many plugins
are available to modify the behavior and extend the functionality of
Catalyst itself. A few of the most common are the optional authentication,
authorization and session plugins.
</p><p>
These plugins provide a consistent API for handling these tasks with a
variety of available back ends. Like the core request/response object
interfaces, they are available as application-wide features that are
accessed and controlled through methods in the context object, which become
available once these plugins have been loaded. 
</p><p>
You can authenticate a user (within an action handling a login form post,
for example) like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$c-&gt;authenticate({
   username =&gt; $c-&gt;request-&gt;params-&gt;{username},
   password =&gt; $c-&gt;request-&gt;params-&gt;{password}
});
</pre>
</p><p>
If this succeeds, the <tt  >$c-&gt;user</tt> object is available in subsequent requests
to control and direct application flow based on the authenticated user.
This is accomplished using sessions (usually cookie-based) that are
handled for you automatically. You also have access to
<tt  >$c-&gt;session</tt> to
persist any additional per-session data across requests.
</p><p>
The API of this framework is agnostic to the back end, and many
are available. You can handle authentication and user storage via databases
(DBIC), system accounts, PAM and LDAP, to name a few. There also
are multiple ways to handle session data to support different application
needs, such as distributed server deployments and so on. (See the
documentation for Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication,
Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization and Catalyst::Plugin::Session for more
information.)
</p><p>
Plugins and application-wide settings are configured within the main/core
class (lib/KillerApp.pm). Within this file, you can specify global
configuration parameters, load Plugins and even add your own code to
override and extend core functionality.
</p><p>
The top-level &ldquo;KillerApp&rdquo; class actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> the application&mdash;it
programmatically loads and integrates the other components and classes
throughout the system. Like any derived class, its behaviors can be
selectively altered from that of its parent class (&ldquo;Catalyst&rdquo;). Since it
uses the powerful &ldquo;Moose&rdquo; object system, in addition to adding and
replacing methods, you also can take advantage of additional powerful
features like method modifiers and Roles (in fact, Plugins are essentially
Moose Roles applied to this class).
</p><p>
Catalyst was written with customization and extensibility in mind. It's
structured to allow its functions and behaviors to be modified easily in a
fine-grained manner. 
</p><p>
For example, you could configure every response to be set with
&ldquo;no-cache&rdquo;
across the whole application simply by adding a method modifier like this
to lib/KillerApp.pm:


<pre     class="programlisting">
before 'finalize_headers' =&gt; sub {
        my $c = shift;
        $c-&gt;response-&gt;headers-&gt;header( 'Cache-control' =&gt; 'no-cache' );
};
</pre>
</p><p>
Catalyst calls methods with meaningful names (such as 'finalize_headers')
throughout the various stages of processing that you are free to hook into
or override.

Deploying Your Application</h2></div></div><p>
Like most things in Catalyst, many options are available when you're
ready to deploy your application to a real Web server&mdash;Apache/FastCGI is
one of the best choices available. I briefly cover this below.
</p><p>
If you put your application in /var/www, for example, you can deploy with
an Apache virtual host configuration like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName www.example.com
    ServerAdmin webmaster@example.com

    Alias /static/ /var/www/KillerApp/root/static/

    FastCgiServer /var/www/KillerApp/script/killerapp_fastcgi.pl \
        -processes 5 

    Alias / /var/www/KillerApp/script/killerapp_fastcgi.pl/

    ErrorLog /var/www/logs/error_log
    CustomLog /var/www/logs/access_log combined

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
FastCGI is a proven, language-independent interface for running Web
applications. It is essentially just plain CGI, but it keeps programs running
in the background instead of firing them up for every request. This is the
major limitation of CGI that FastCGI overcomes. FastCGI has been around
for a long time. The use of this efficient protocol is another example of
how Catalyst leverages existing solutions.
</p><p>
FastCGI allows you to specify the number of processes to run (five in the
example above), making your application multithreaded. Incoming requests
are distributed evenly among the processes, which are maintained in a pool.
</p><p>
The alias for <tt  >/static/</tt> above tells Apache to serve
the files directly in
this directory (images, CSS, JavaScript files and so on). This is more efficient
than serving these files through the application, which isn't necessary.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article is meant to provide only a taste of Catalyst and its
capabilities. As I hope you have seen, Catalyst is a viable platform for
any Web development project. With a flexible design and many available
mature features, you can use Catalyst to build robust applications quickly
and conveniently.
</p><p>
Catalyst is actively developed and is getting better all the time,
including its ever-increasing quality documentation. It also has a very active
user community with top experts available via IRC.
</p><p>
When you're ready to start writing an application, you should be able to
find the information and support you need to hit the ground running. See
the Resources for this article for important links and where to get started.
