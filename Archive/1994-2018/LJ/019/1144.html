    Trappen is a low-powered Linux box on the Internet. It serves uucp
    e-mail
    and news feeds to two home Linux machines. It also provides anonymous
    ftp and
    telnet terminal capabilities. This is its story.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e89580.0x1f81500"></a></h2></div></div><p>I work in a research lab with many Unix
boxes. My problem is that these boxes are dedicated to research
almost all the time. Our system administrator doesn't really have
time to support people like me, who want more than the traditional
dial-in e-mail reading. Sure, <span   class="emphasis"><em>term</em></span> is quite
useful, but I'm a traditionalist.
</p><p>You see, I run Linux at home. I have the full power of a Unix
machine in my house, and I am not going to be satisfied by using it
as a terminal to dial into a server with it. I want my own
e-mail!</p><p>In the old days of Unix, before Internet, machines
transferred e-mail, news, and files flawlessly [Well, pretty well,
anyway&mdash;Ed] by calling each other up over phone lines. A machine
could have dozens of modems and would accept calls and periodically
call up other machines using the system called uucp&mdash;Unix-to-Unix
copy. Instead of getting files through anonymous ftp, people used
&ldquo;public uucp&rdquo;. Instead of writing some nightmarish scripts to call
in, transfer files, hang up, and process them, I thought&mdash;why not
use uucp?</p><p>So I began looking for a machine to use. About that time, a
friend of mine was hired, and we found an old computer in his
office. It was an old 16 MHz 386SX. In its previous life, it ran
Procomm and was a full-time <span   class="emphasis"><em>terminal</em></span>. What a
change we had in mind&mdash;we transformed it into a multi-tasking
Unix <span   class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span>! It had 4MB of RAM, which was
enough to run Linux. But the hard disk wasn't much to gawk
at&mdash;40MB. We named it &ldquo;trappen&rdquo;.</p><p>The purpose of trappen was two-fold. First, we wanted uucp
connectivity to our home Linux boxes. Second, we wanted to provide
anonymous ftp and http for ourselves; not that we badly needed it
(though it would be handy) but more because it's fun to have your
own personal Unix server.</p><p>We decided to split the disk in half&mdash;20MB for the system
and swap space, and 20MB for file storage. Now, it needed about 5MB
of swap space, so how was I supposed to squeeze a Linux system into
15MB and still have plenty of room for news, e-mail, and ftp-able
files?</p><p>I've installed many Linux systems over the years, but I
always simple used Ethernet to copy my setup onto the target
computer. (I have almost created my own distribution.) But my
system would take me days to prune down to 15MB. I had to resort to
using someone else's distribution, instead.</p><p>In the beginning, Linux distributions were not really very
fancy. They gave you the files, and you were on your own. If you
weren't a Unix expert, you could get stuck in a swamp of daemons,
config files, and strange programs. But I knew installations were
getting better, so I decided it was worth a try.</p><p>I grabbed the latest Slackware distribution and looked at the
disk contents; I could do it. I didn't need any programming
libraries, and I didn't need X-Windows or anything fancy. Just the
basics. About 20 minutes later, I had the tiniest Unix system I've
ever seen! I went ahead and installed everything I needed, and it
took 14MB! I had all the binaries I needed: news-readers,
mail-readers, and uucp. The next step was to configure
everything.</p><p>Now I expected to have a lot of things to configure. We had
<span   class="bold"><b>smail</b></span>, anonymous ftp, and the
rest, but the Slackware system did such a good job of setting up
default configuration files that most things worked out of the box.
What I <span   class="emphasis"><em>did</em></span> spend time on was smail and uucp. I
set up uucp to route things to our two Linux boxes at home, and
configured smail to use it. Then we went through and stripped out
any functionality we didn't need, to make the system even
smaller.</p><p>To support us, our network administrator here at the lab
agreed to put in DNS MX records for our home computers, pointing to
trappen. This would allow e-mail addressed to us at our home
machines to be sent to trappen, which would process and spool it
and forward it to us when we were connected.</p><p>Through trappen, we now had e-mail at home&mdash;not just for us,
but for anyone who had accounts on our machines. My whole family
has access, and they're learning to use e-mail and news. (It takes
quite a bit of disk space to store news at home, but I only have a
few groups, and I don't keep articles for very long.)</p><p>Trappen has plenty of power for all its tasks, though it is
pretty slow interactively. But we have its console, as well as a
Wyse terminal in its office. We decided to make the ultimate use of
the console and terminal&mdash;as telnet terminals to other, more
powerful machines. We decided to write a program which would ask
for a host to telnet to, which would allow trappen to function as a
terminal server. It turned out to be easy, thanks to the getty_ps
package. <span   class="bold"><b>Getty_ps</b></span> is so versatile
that we were able to set up configuration files such that instead
of spawning login, it would spawn telnet. We changed the login
prompt accordingly, and voila! Trappen's VGA console is the fastest
terminal we have in the building, especially because it runs over
Ethernet. The serial terminal attached to it is quite handy to
check e-mail with.</p><p>Everything worked perfectly! We didn't have to touch trappen
for a week. In fact, when we had time we decided to add a few
enhancements. We added a uucp-ftp gateway. Someone can anonymously
ftp and place files in a directory named to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>computer</em></span> and trappen will automatically copy
the files to a directory on the machine with that name.</p><p>Then we really went all-out. We didn't want to put an entire
X-Windows environment on trappen (it was quite under powered), but
it did have a VGA card. We got the X-Windows server program and all
the X-Windows fonts and copied them over. Then we ran X-Windows
with the -query option, which causes it to be an X-terminal to
another machine, in this case to one of our high-powered machines
in the lab. It worked! Trappen didn't have nearly enough power to
run X-Windows applications locally but it wasn't bad as a graphical
terminal. We eventually decided it was too slow, but it did work,
and did not require much disk space.</p><p>Trappen is still going strong, over a year after it was
&ldquo;born&rdquo;. It now allows slip access for our home machines. The CPU is
severely limited in power, and during interactive use, it is quite
slow, but transferring files and telnet sessions through trappen to
other machines is almost instantaneous. Trappen now supports
several users who use it to access the Internet.</p><p>UUCP is almost completely error-proof, so when I want to
transfer a file between home and work, I uucp it. Trappen doesn't
call out right away, but the machines connect every few hours. It
doesn't matter if it can't connect right away; uucp always gets
through eventually, and I know that when I get home, the file will
be waiting in my incoming directory.</p></div></div>
