    months, and some of the debian developers are working on ELF issues.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2498580.0x2590190"></a></h2></div></div><p>Nearly all the major Linux distributions
have announced some support for ELF, and some have beta versions
available on the Internet. Red Hat, Slackware, and Yggdrasil have
each announced that alpha or beta level ELF-based distributions are
available from their standard FTP sites. By the time you read this,
all three expect to be shipping production-quality ELF-based
distributions.
</p><p>Debian has had ELF support for its standard distribution
available to developers and all other interested parties for
several months, and some of the debian developers are working on
ELF issues. The current release is a.out-based, but users will be
able to upgrade to ELF without re-installing the distribution. This
in-place upgradability has been included in Debian for a long time,
and has been well tested. Debian can be retrieved via FTP from
ftp.debian.com and mirrors including tsx-11.mit.edu and its mirrors
worldwide.</p><p>Red Hat's beta is available via FTP from ftp.pht.com,
ftp.caldera.com, and other mirrors, and is being tested as of late
August and early September. Red Hat has committed to a
production-quality release in September to support the second
preview release of the Caldera Network Desktop, which is built on
top of Red Hat's distribution.</p><p>For several months, Slackware has provided Slackware 2.3 in
a.out format and a beta-quality ELF distribution as well.
Slackware's ELF distribution is unusual in retaining an a.out boot
disk for installation. Slackware, including the ELF beta, is always
available from ftp.cdrom.com.</p><p>Yggdrasil avoided releasing a new release of their Plug and
Play Linux this spring, and instead put their resources into
developing an all-ELF distribution. That beta-quality distribution
was made available for FTP from ftp.yggdrasil.com in August.</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> is not officially
recommending any one particular distribution. We will (finally!) be
publishing a very comprehensive overview of the most common
distributions early next year, which should allow readers to make
their own more informed decisions, based partly on the information
<i  >LJ</i> provides.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2498580.0x2590500"></a>In other news...</h2></div></div><p>DEC has announced that they have ported the XFree86 XF86_SVGA
server to Linux/Alpha. This alpha-quality release is not guaranteed
to work on all S3 boards, but X support for Linux/Alpha does now
exist.</p><p>Jim Freeman announced that he has written a pre-alpha Linux
Frame Relay driver is available for the Sangoma S502 Frame Relay
card (a Z80 co-processed ISA card) from
ftp://ftp.sovereign.org/pub/wan/fr/s502fr.tgz and
ftp://www.caldera.com/pub/wan/fr/s502fr.tgz (new versions may be
available by the time you read this). See
<a href="http://www.sovereign.org" target="_self">http://www.sovereign.org/</a>
for current information.</p><p>Vipul Gupta and Ben Lancki introduced alpha support for
Mobile-IP for Linux. Patches are available at the ftp site
anchor.cs.binghamton.edu in
/pub/Linux-MobileIP/Linux-MobileIP.tar.gz</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2498580.0x2590710"></a>What is ELF?</h2></div></div><p>ELF, which stands for Executable and Linking Format, is the
new binary file format which has been implemented for Linux.
Previously, Linux has used a version of the old &ldquo;a.out&rdquo; format, but
that format has many limitations that ELF corrects. ELF was
originally designed for UNIX System V Release 4, and for various
reasons (technical and political) is becoming the most popular
binary file format for UNIX and related operating systems such as
Linux.</p><p>The Linux ELF implementation has been approximately two years
in the making, and is of very high quality. Most of the ELF support
in the GNU utilties was done by Linux developers to support this
implementation.</p><p>Linux distributors are working to make the change to ELF as
painless as possible for Linux users.</p><p>For more information on ELF, see <i  >Linux Journal</i> issue 16 (August 1995) <span   class="emphasis"><em>Stop The
Presses</em></span> for a light explanation, and issues 12 and 13
(April and May 1995) for a technical overview of the ELF file
format.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2498580.0x25909d0"></a>ELF-based or &ldquo;Supports ELF&rdquo;?</h2></div></div><p>What&ldquo;s the difference? ELF-ased means that all (or perhaps
almost all) of the binaries and libraries in the system use the ELF
file format. &rdquo;Supports ELF" merely means that ELF libraries are
included, so Linux binaries created for ELF systems will run. An
ELF-based Linux distribution may also support a.out binaries by
including the a.out libraries.</p><p>You only need a distribution that supports ELF in order to
run ELF binaries. However, if you are running both a.out and ELF
binaries at the same time, it requires a bit more memory than if
you are only running one or the other, so if you need to run some
ELF binaries, you are probably better off switching to a completely
ELF&lt;\#45&gt;based distribution if you have the time to do
so.</p><p>Some distributions (particularily Debian) give you the option
to upgrade from a.out to ELF with ease. Red Hat has promised a
floppy disk that you can use to record the most important parts of
your current configuration (such as your carefully&lt;\#45&gt;tuned
X Windows setup and networking configuration), which will be used
to automatically recreate your configuration when installing Red
Hat. This should work for upgrading from any distribution.</p></div></div>
