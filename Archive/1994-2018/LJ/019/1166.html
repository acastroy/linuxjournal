       This excerpt from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Essential System Administration</em></span> describes
    useful details of booting Linux on a PC.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23de580.0x24d6558"></a></h2></div></div><p>In general, the boot process on a
microcomputer has three stages: the system's master boot record
(MBR) contains the primary boot program which starts the boot
process and loads a secondary boot program from the boot blocks of
the active partition; this second boot program is what loads the
actual kernel.
</p><p>Linux provides LILO, the Linux Loader, which can function as
either a master boot program or a secondary boot program.
<span   class="bold"><b>lilo</b></span> is installed with a command
like this one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# lilo -C /etc/lilo.conf
</pre><p>The <b  >-C</b> option specifies the location of
LILO's configuration file. (The location in the preceding command
is, in fact, the default location, and so the <b  >-C</b>
clause is redundant.)</p><p>The lilo.conf file specifies LILO's behavior for certain
aspects of the boot process and also defines the kernels and
operating systems that it can boot. The following excerpt from a
lilo.config file lists the most important entries&mdash;and the ones
that you are most likely to want or need to modify:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Wait 10 seconds before autobooting 1st entry.timeout=100
# Allow user to enter a boot command.
prompt
# Where to install/configure LILO
# (no partition #=MBR) [see below]
boot=/dev/hda
...
# Text file displayed before boot prompt.
message = /boot/boot.message
#
# Default kernel is the first one listed.
image = /vmlinuz
# Boot prompt command to boot this kernel.
  label = linux
# Fix for Sony CD-ROM (post 1.1.72)
# Specifies parameters to pass to kernel,
# changing CD-ROM's compiled-in I/O address.
  append = "cdu31a=0x340,0,"
#
# An alternate Linux kernel
image = /safe
# Its boot command
  label = safe
  append = "cdu31a=0x340,0,"
...
# A different operating system (DOS)
other = /dev/hdb1
# Use the D: drive boot loader.
  loader = /boot/any_d.b
# Use this partition table.
  table = /dev/hdb
# This is the corresponding boot command.
  label = ddog
</pre><p>[I tend to install LILO both in the MBR and the Linux
partition for maximum flexibility, by running a second LILO command
using its <b  >-b</b> option (which replaces the boot
entry in the configuration file):<b  ># lilo -b /dev/hda1 -C
/etc/lilo.conf</b>This way, if I decide to remove LILO from
the MBR, I'll be all set to switch over to the Linux partition
version.]</p><p>The final section (&ldquo;stanza&rdquo;) illustrates the format for
booting a DOS partition on the second hard disk; it uses an
alternate loader, any_d.b, which tricks DOS into thinking it's on
the C: drive. There are also loaders provided for OS/2 on the D:
drive and DOS on the B: drive (os2_d.b and any_b.d, respectively;
chain.b is the default loader for other operating systems).</p><p>If the label for a stanza is omitted, it defaults to the
final component of the image or other entry (for example, vmlinuz
or hda1).</p><p>The entry for a DOS partition on the C: drive is simpler,
looking something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
other = /dev/hda1  label = dos
  table = /dev/hda
</pre><p>This stanza is actually what you need for any foreign
operating system on /dev/hda1. There is one additional trick needed
if SCO Unix is the operating system you want to boot. In order for
LILO to successfully boot a SCO Unix partition, that partition must
be the only active partition on the C: drive. This means you will
have to turn off the active (boot) flag on the Linux partition and
turn it on for the SCO Unix partition, using the Linux fdisk or
cfdisk, before trying to boot SCO Unix (in addition to running LILO
to install the new configuration). Note that LILO must be the
master boot loader in this case.</p><p>Note: You will need to rerun the LILO command to reinstall it
every time you rebuild the kernel or change any relevant aspect of
the disk partitioning scheme. If you forget to do this, the system
will not boot and you'll have to boot from a floppy. You will also
need to rerun LILO if you change the text of the boot.message
file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23de580.0x24d6c38"></a>More Complex Booting Scenarios</h2></div></div><p>Booting a Linux partition on the second hard drive is also
possible. For this to work, LILO must be installed in the MBR of
the system's boot disk, as well as the secondary boot program in
the Linux partition itself&mdash;this is usually taken care of when you
install Linux on the hard disk and will be assumed in what follows.
In this case, the best way to proceed is in two stages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>First, set up a lilo.conf like this one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
boot=/dev/hdaroot=current
image=/vmlinuz
  label=linux
other=/dev/hda1
  unsafe
other=/dev/hda2
  unsafe
...
other=/dev/hdb4
  unsafe
</pre></li><li><p>Define all of the partitions on both hard disks in
the same way; the unsafe keyword tells LILO not to read the boot
blocks or the disk's partition table for that entry&mdash;it basically
says, &ldquo;Trust me and do what I tell you.&rdquo; Install this LILO
configuration, and make sure that Linux is bootable.</p></li><li><p>Then, modify the file, changing entries for any
bootable partitions on /dev/hda to their correct form and removing
ones you don't need, and rerun the LILO command.</p></li></ul></div><p>It is also possible to boot a Linux partition on each of two
disks. The procedure for doing so is the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Decide which one will be the usual Linux boot
partition and set up LILO to boot it and any other non-Linux
operating systems on both disks. Create an entry like the following
for the second Linux partition:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
other = /dev/hdb2  label=eviltwin
  unsafe
</pre></li><li><p>Create a boot.message file which tells you which
Linux will be booted when you select the default option. Install
this configuration into the MBR on the C: drive.</p></li><li><p>Create (or retain) another LILO configuration for
the second Linux partition, this time including an unsafe entry for
the first Linux partition if you want to (this again assumes that
LILO is installed in that partition, which usually happens at upon
installation of the OS). Make sure that this partition's
boot.message file also lets you know where you are. Install this
configuration into the Linux partition only&mdash;make sure that the
boot entry specifies the partition and not the disk as a whole.
</p><p>The boot sequence will then go something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Welcome to gallant.Boot choices: linux (default; on C:), dos,
 eviltwin (Linux on D:), sco
boot: eviltwin
Welcome to goofus.
Boot choices: test (default; on D:),  goodtwin (Linux on C:)
boot: [Return]
Loading test...
</pre></li></ul></div><p>Given these selections, Linux will boot from the D: drive.
What happens is the LILO from the MBR on drive C: runs first, and
it then starts the boot program on the Linux partition on the D:
drive&mdash;which is again LILO. That (second) LILO then loads the
kernel from the D: drive. (Note that if you wanted to, you could
just keep popping back and forth between the LILO programs on C:
and D: ad infinitum.)</p><p>If you think this is pretty silly, then omit the prompt
keyword from the LILO configuration file for the D: drive (as well
as its image section for the Linux partition on the C: drive),
resulting in a simple lilo.conf file on the D: drive:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
install=/boot/boot.bboot=/dev/hdb2
root=/dev/hdb2
map=/boot/map
image=/vmlinuz
  label=linux
</pre><p>Once this is installed, selecting eviltwin at the initial
boot prompt will immediately boot the Linux partition on the second
hard disk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23de580.0x24d7528"></a>LILO's -r option</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes it is useful to be able to run LILO for a disk
partition mounted somewhere other than /. For example, if you have
another Linux root filesystem mounted at /mnt, you might want to
run LILO to install the kernel (currently) at /mnt/vmlinuz using
the configuration file /mnt/etc/lilo.conf. LILO's
<b  >-r</b> option is designed for such a purpose. It
sets the root directory location for the LILO operation to the
directory specified as its argument and looks for all files
relative to that point. Thus, for the scenario we've been
discussing, the correct command is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# lilo -r /mnt
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23de580.0x24d76e0"></a>The boot.message File</h2></div></div><p>The boot.message file is displayed before the boot prompt is
issued. Here is an example boot.message file:</p><pre     class="screen">
Welcome to JAG Property of the Linux Guerrilla Hackers
AssociationComputational science is not for the fainthearted!
Our current boot offerings include:
   * linux (smaller test kernel--1.3.10 currently)
   * safe (Yggdrasil distribution)
   * hacked (do you feel lucky?)
   * ddog - guess what ... (on D:)
</pre><p>An effective file will list all the defined labels (but it
needn't be this eccentric).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23de580.0x24d7898"></a>Restoring the DOS Master Boot Program</h2></div></div><p>Should you ever need to, here is the procedure for restoring
the DOS master boot program:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Boot from a bootable DOS floppy.</p></li><li><p>Run the command <b  >fdisk
/MBR</b></p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23de580.0x24d7bb0"></a>The Linux-FT Bootmanager</h2></div></div><p>The Linux-FT distribution replaces the entire LILO apparatus
with its Bootmanager facility, a graphical menu-based,
user-configurable utility by which you can select which kernel to
boot. Its display looks something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
              Bootmanager
  Name     Location
MULTIUSER   :3/vmlinuz ro root=/dev/sda3 2
SINGLE      :3/vmlinuz ro root=/dev/sda3 single
FLOPPY      A:
INSTALL     :3/vmlinuz root=/dev/sr0 ramdisk=300 5
DOS         C:1
LUCKY       :4/test_kern ro root=/dev/sda4
</pre><p>The Location field indicates the kernel to boot. For example,
the MULTIUSER item will boot the file /vmlinuz on the third disk
partition of the current disk, using the indicated device as the
root filesystem, booting to run level 2. The DOS item will boot
partition 1 on the first hard disk (C:). The final item is one
added for this system.</p><p>Customizing the Bootmanager is easy. Press ESC to override
the automatic boot timeout, and then use the cursor and function
keys listed at the bottom of the screen to edit the relevant
fields. Hardware options applicable to all boot sequences may be
entered into the designated field below the boot choices
menu.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23de580.0x28d0010"></a>Introducing Linux Loadable Modules</h2></div></div><p>Very recently (since version 1.2), the Linux kernel has
supported loadable modules. As of this writing, the Debian and
Linux-FT distributions use this functionality by default.</p><p>In this scheme, you build a minimal kernel and dynamically
load modules providing additional functionality as required. Such
an approach has the advantage that many types of system changes
will no longer require a kernel rebuild; it also has the potential
to significantly decrease the size of the kernel executable.</p><p>The modules package provides utilities for building,
installing and loading kernel modules (including ones needed to
build a kernel with module support). Running <b  >make
modules</b> after building a kernel will create the loadable
modules files, and <b  >make modules_install</b> will
install them into the /lib/modules/1.2.6 directory tree (where the
final component denotes the kernel release level). The
configuration file /etc/MODULES (or /etc/modules) lists modules to
be loaded automatically at boot time:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sysviBCS
ppp
</pre><p>This file says to load the modules supporting the System V
filesystem type, the Intel Binary Compatability facility, and the
PPP facility.</p><p>The following utilities are used to manipulate
modules:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>depmod: Determines dependencies among modules. For
example, the ppp module I selected earlier requires the slhc module
to function. depmod creates the file modules.dep in the relevant
subdirectory of /lib/modules. This utility may be run automatically
at boot time or you may need to execute it manually after building
modules.</p></li><li><p>modprobe: Loads a module as well as all of those
that it depends on (usually used to load modules on boots).</p></li><li><p>insmod: Loads a module interactively.</p></li><li><p>rmmod: Unloads a loaded module from the kernel
(provided it is not in use).</p></li><li><p>lsmod: Lists currently-loaded modules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Module:        # pages:  Used by:iBCS               19
ppp                 5
slhc                2    [ppp]
sysv                7
</pre></li></ul></div><p>At this point, the loadable modules facility is in its
infancy, and only a few modules are available, but this will
undoubtedly be the way Linux kernels generally operate in the
not-too-distant future (and it is the way many other Unix versions
already work).</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Reprinted with minor alterations by permission
