    Last month, Jim narrated the development of the basic
    infrastructure needed to port Linux to the Alpha. In this
    second of three parts, he describes the task of porting the
    kernel and basic environment needed to get to the shell
    prompt.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24c7580.0x25bf3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>With all of the infrastructure in place,
I was now able to turn my attention to the task of porting the
kernel itself. My experience with previous Unix ports has been that
the greatest number of system dependencies are found in the virtual
memory subsystem, the process scheduler, the system call interface,
the device drivers, and the trap handlers. In this particular case,
I wasn't worried about the device drivers because I was prepared to
write a few trivial drivers to interface to the console devices
anyway.
</p><p>My own approach to software development and porting is to
consider the data structures central to the operation of the
program. Accordingly, I used the kernel include files as my
starting point for understanding the code's structure and system
dependencies. I combed through the include files, making notations
as to where I thought there would be system dependencies and where
algorithms might need to be modified for the new environment.
Frequently I'd go back and forth between the include files, the C
code, and my porting notes. Eventually a (relatively) coherent
approach to the port emerged, which I began implementing.</p><p>One change that I made everywhere&mdash;and later
regretted&mdash;involved the <b  >cli()</b> and <b  >sti()</b>
routines. On Intel, <b  >cli()</b> and
<b  >sti()</b> disable and enable interrupts,
respectively. The Digital Unix PALcode on Alpha, however,
implements a seven-level prioritized interrupt scheme. At the time
that I started the port, I was not certain whether it would be
necessary to preserve the interrupt hierarchy.</p><p>I laboriously replaced all instances of
<b  >cli()</b> with calls to the <b  >ipl()</b>
routine, setting the current IPL (interrupt priority level) to the
maximum and preserving the previous IPL. I replaced calls to
<b  >sti()</b> with calls to <b  >ipl()</b> to
restore the previously-saved level. I did this because I was not
certain what the IPL might be when a particular piece of code is
run, and it would be a mistake to implement
<b  >sti()</b> as <b  >ipl(0)</b> if the code
in fact had been entered at a non-zero IPLl; it turned out that
this was largely unnecessary.</p><p>Linux implements two-stage interrupt handling, where
interrupt service routines are divided into a &ldquo;top half&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;bottom half&rdquo;. The top half is what runs at nonzero IPL when the
interrupt is received. Generally, the top half performs the minimum
amount of work necessary to acknowledge the interrupt, and queues
subsequent actions to be run by the bottom half. This means that
the interrupt handlers themselves are pretty much self-contained,
and the bulk of the kernel code runs at IPL 0 unless explicitly
raised. For Alpha, I could just as easily implement
<b  >cli()</b> as <b  >ipl(IPLMAX)</b> and
<b  >sti()</b> as <b  >ipl(0)</b>, without ill
effects. This is exactly what we did for the device driver
work.</p><p>The virtual memory subsystem was one of those places where I
had to implement Alpha-specific versions of Intel-specific
routines. In many ways, the Alpha memory-mapping scheme is similar
to the Intel scheme: Intel uses a two-level page table to map a
32-bit virtual address space, while Alpha uses a three- level page
table to map a 64-bit virtual address space. However, if one is
only mapping 32 bits of virtual address, Alpha only requires a
single first-level page table entry and a single second-level page
table. Therefore, on a 32-bit system the Alpha scheme essentially
collapses into a two-level scheme. The upshot of all this is that
similar algorithms could be used to manipulate both Intel and Alpha
page tables.</p><p>The Alpha Level 1 page table is set up once at boot time and
is never heard from again; the Level 2 page table corresponds to
the Page Directory on Intel; the Level 3 page tables correspond to
the actual Intel page tables. In fact, to save memory, I
implemented only a single system-wide Level 2 page table. It turns
out that with the addressing scheme that I outlined above, I could
map the entire address space using only the first 256 Level 2 page
table entries, 128 of which can map the entire user address space.
Therefore, I maintained a single Level 2 page table, kept the
kernel entries continually mapped, and copied in new user entries
for each context switch. The contents of the user entries were kept
in the <b  >pcb_struct</b> (an Alpha-specific structure
not present in the Intel version), which was attached to the
<b  >task_struct</b>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Intel Linux memory-management code took
advantage of some fortuitous features of the Intel paging model.
For instance, to obtain the physical memory address of a virtual
memory page on Intel, you can simply obtain the corresponding page
table entry and mask out the low bits. Page table entries on Alpha
are not so accommodating&mdash;they are 64 bits wide. If I had 64-bit
computation available to me at the beginning, I could do a mask and
a shift. As it was, I had to treat a page table entry as a struct
of two integers, extract the page frame number from one member, and
shift it to obtain the physical address.</p><p>Because I ended up changing virtually every line of memory.c
to accommodate the slightly different page frame traversal and
parsing semantics, I instead produced two versions of every routine
in memory.c&mdash;one for i386, and one for alpha. Context switching
was another area requiring significant change, and one of the more
difficult to debug. Much of the context switching and system call
handling code had to be rewritten, as it was originally implemented
in Intel assembly language. Intel code saves some process state on
the stack, but relies on the native task-switching mechanism of the
Intel CPU to save and restore other process state to and from the
Task State Segment (TSS). While the Digital Unix PALcode supports
the concept of a &ldquo;process context&rdquo; structure, this structure
contains relatively little of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>actual</em></span>
process context. Instead, it contains the vital pointers (kernel
stack pointer, user stack pointer, page table base register) needed
to allow a process to save and restore its <span   class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span>
context.</p><p>Most of the process context for a Linux/Alpha process resides
on the process's kernel stack. Six items (<b  >PS</b>,
<b  >PC</b>, <b  >GP</b>,
<b  >A0</b>, <b  >A1</b>, and
<b  >A2</b>) are pushed onto the kernel stack by the
PALcode upon entry into kernel mode (i.e. any time a trap or
interrupt is taken). The remainder of the processor's register
state is either pushed onto the kernel stack by the trap handler,
or stored in the process's <b  >task_struct</b>.</p><p>In my 32-bit port, I decided to play it safe by always
pushing the <span   class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> register state onto the
stack, including the floating-point registers. This is needlessly
wasteful, of course, especially if the process in question has
never used the floating-point registers. I had hoped eventually to
optimize the register save/restore path, but our development group
switched to version 1.2 before I got around to it.</p><p>I also had to update the Level 2 page table area on every
context switch. There were 128 Level 2 page table entries per
process, of which at most two or three were typically used. For
ease of implementation, I simply saved and restored all 128 entries
on every context switch. Again, this was something I had hoped to
be able to optimize but didn't get a chance to implement before
cutting over to 1.2.</p><p>Re-implementing the system call and trap handlers was not too
difficult. For the system call handler, I had to figure out the
Intel system call semantics for passing arguments in registers, and
use the analogous Alpha registers to pass arguments. As for trap
handling: while Alpha implements a different set of traps than
Intel, it was relatively straightforward to figure out where to
vector the various Alpha traps.</p><p>The only pieces of the file system that required extensive
attention were the buffer cache and the <b  >exec()</b>
code. The buffer cache had to be reviewed to verify that it would
work with a different hardware page size (8KB on Alpha as opposed
to 4KB on Intel). The <b  >exec()</b> code had to be made
aware of the executable file format generated by gcc and the GNU
binutils (in this case, it was a COFF variant).</p><p>After several weeks of reviewing and modifying code, I was
ready to try to compile it. Not surprisingly, getting a clean
compile was itself an iterative process. I would encounter an
error, decide whether it represented an error on my part or an
attempt to compile code that I did not yet want to support, and
take appropriate action.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24c7580.0x25c0318"></a>Hello, World!</h2></div></div><p>After much effort, I finally had an executable file named
&ldquo;linux&rdquo; full of Alpha code. The next step was to try to boot
it.</p><p>Not surprisingly, I did not get very far the first time...or
the second...or the third. So I put a <b  >printk</b>
statement early in the boot sequence so that I could show some
early success to my management, and added many additional
<b  >printk</b>'s to track the progress of the kernel
through the initialization sequences. Most of the problems I
encountered over the succeeding weeks were due to errors on my part
in not attending to all the ramifications of certain code changes.
What was amazing was that the code I didn't touch frequently worked
perfectly the first time. For example, I would spend several days
debugging <b  >init()</b>, then when it came time to
mount the root file system it would just work.</p><p>Once I had mounted the root file system and completed all of
the kernel initializations, the next step was to run a user-mode
executable. Since I did not yet have a C runtime library or any gcc
support for anything but the kernel, I decided to hand-craft a
program that, though extremely simple, would nonetheless show some
outward sign of functioning. I wrote a variant of the ever-popular
&ldquo;hello, world&rdquo; program in assembly language. Instead of using
printf(), I hand-crafted a system call in assembly which called the
<b  >write()</b> system call, passing it the address and
length of the string. Attempting to run this program provided me
with much opportunity to debug the <b  >exec()</b> code
in the file system and the virtual memory page-fault handler.
Eventually, though, Linux/Alpha did indeed say &ldquo;hello, world&rdquo; to
me.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24c7580.0x25c0688"></a>The C Runtime Library</h2></div></div><p>At this point, I needed more executables both to test
Linux/Alpha and to transform it from a kernel into a useful system.
Since I had not designed my 32-bit port to be binary- compatible
with anything else (such as Digital Unix), I had to produce any
executables I was going to use from scratch. In order to compile
anything other than specially hand-crafted programs, I was going to
need a C runtime library. At this point the project had grown
larger than one person could handle. (Actually, it had passed that
point long before, but at this point I could no longer deny
it.)</p><p>Fortunately, help arrived in the person of Brian Nelson.
Brian had been working for our group for some time already,
supporting the VEST VAX-to-Alpha binary translator. At this point
VEST's support requirements had diminished somewhat and Brian found
himself with some time on his hands. Although he knew very little
Unix at the time, his enthusiasm for the Linux project more than
made up for any lack of specific knowledge. I tutored him in the
arcana of gcc, make, and libraries, and set him off porting the GNU
libc from the InfoMagic CD-ROM to Alpha. I handled some of the
system- dependent portions while Brian handled the rest.</p><p>Porting libc turned out to be less than trivial, mainly
because we could not get libc's <b  >symbol_alias</b>
macro to work properly for the life of us. This macro essentially
creates a symbol in the object file's symbol table which is an
exact synonym for another symbol, and stdio uses it heavily. We
finally managed to build a &ldquo;Frankenstein-style&rdquo; libc by stitching
together pieces from various sources. Most of it was GNU libc 4.1,
but stdio came from BSD, and a few miscellaneous routines came from
wherever I could scare them up. Nevertheless, we managed (after a
fashion) to get clean builds of various GNU utilities using this
library.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24c7580.0x25c0898"></a>Porting Some Utilities</h2></div></div><p>We started out porting some Slackware packages, but soon
realized that a smaller distribution would get us to a usable
system more quickly. I poked around and decided that MCC would be a
better choice.</p><p>One problem we had compiling virtually any package had to do
with configuration. The auto-configure scripts with several
packages did not understand the concept of cross-compilation. Since
we were doing our development on a Digital Unix system, attempts to
configure packages would either fail or produce a Digital Unix
version when I wanted a Linux version. Finally I suggested to Brian
that he log into an Intel Linux system, configure the packages
there, hand-edit the makefile to reference the cross-tool suite,
then compile the package on the Digital Unix system using the
Linux/Alpha cross tools. This rather baroque strategy actually
worked, and he was finally able to get clean builds of some of the
smaller utilities. One of the first things I needed was a shell.
Brian started off porting <span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span>,
but ran into troubles. I scoured the net and found a bunch of
freeware shells. Brian and I then started porting like mad until we
could get one that would compile cleanly with the cross tools. We
finally were able to compile the Plan-9
<span   class="bold"><b>rc</b></span> shell.</p><p>Brian then went off to continue porting other utilities while
I tried to boot Linux and run the
<span   class="bold"><b>rc</b></span> shell.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24c7580.0x25c0b58"></a>Getting to the Shell Prompt</h2></div></div><p>Often, code that works in the trivial case can fail in subtle
ways when presented with a more complicated case&mdash;such was the
situation with the shell. While the COFF image-loading code that I
was using worked for loading a one-page &ldquo;hello, world&rdquo;
executable, bugs showed themselves when I attempted to use it on a
larger file. Once these problems were resolved, I had to debug the
various system calls that rc was attempting to use.</p><p>When debugging a newly-ported utility that uses a newly-
ported library and runs on a newly-ported system, one needs to keep
an open mind as to where potential problems might be. While
debugging rc, I ran into problems in all areas. In one case I was
not propagating system call error status correctly from the kernel
to the user; this caused an erroneous success condition to be
returned to the program. In another case, I found that the kernel
<b  >init()</b> function was not correctly opening
/dev/tty0, so that even if rc had been running correctly, it could
not have read from or written to the console.</p><p>Late one afternoon, I was working from home, using the ISP
Alpha simulator and several <span   class="bold"><b>nm</b></span>
listings to debug yet another rc problem. I'd just fixed a
virtual-memory bug when I sent a mail message to my colleagues
stating that I was well on my way and would probably have a shell
prompt by the end of the week. Then I tried One More Fix, rebooted,
watched the initialization messages scroll by, and then saw the
screen freeze. On closer inspection, I saw a prompt at the bottom
of the screen! Pressing <b  >return</b> had the desired
effect. I had very few tools to work with, but I could simulate a
crude <b  >ls</b> by typing <b  >echo</b> ; I
did that, and was greeted with the names of the few files on the
root file system.</p><p>Achieving the shell prompt is one of the major achievements
of any operating system porting project. I informed my colleagues,
and we knocked off and had a beer, proud of our achievement. Next
month, we'll cover debugging and further development.</p></div></div>
