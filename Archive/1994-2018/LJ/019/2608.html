    SCO Forum, famous for its fun, casual environment, offered
    thought-provoking discussions by Scott Adams, Clifford Stoll
    and John Perry Barlow. Linux Torvalds spoke on the future of
    operating systems.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf08580.0x1000348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The ninth annual SCO Forum took place on
the University of California Santa Cruz campus August 20th to 24th,
1995. SCO, Santa Cruz Operations, is the provider of SCO Unix,
billed as &ldquo;the leading PC-Unix&rdquo;. SCO also provides other system
software for businesses.
</p><p>During the Forum, SCO unveiled a new corporate logo to
signify its expansion into new markets, serving the &ldquo;entire
cross-platform world of Unix server and Microsoft Windows desktop
integration.&rdquo; Many SCO speakers reiterated SCO's &ldquo;Windows Friendly&rdquo;
strategy.</p><p>Forum tutorials and conference sessions varied from software
specific to SCO, Marketing on the Internet, to the Future of
Operating Systems.</p><p>The highlight of the sessions included three speakers. Scott
Adams, who writes the Dilbert cartoons, gave a humorous
presentation, augmenting some of his cartoons with the story behind
the cartoon. Some of Adams' cartoons had gotten him into trouble at
his former full-time jobs in the computer industry.</p><p>Stoll worried about the &ldquo;cult of computing&rdquo; noting that
schools have converted their music rooms or their art room into
computer labs, noting that, &ldquo;We are saying something about what's
most important in our society. and it's computing over music and
art... or even history and social interaction.&rdquo;</p><p>Barlow commented about the use of the Internet, &ldquo;I think
we're in the business of creating what Teilhard de Chardin talked
about, writing in the 30's, about the collective organism of mind,
an entirely new layer of the evolutionary process&mdash;evolution that
is self aware.&rdquo;</p><p>As Barlow eloquently started a statement about how the
Internet is &ldquo;...an ecosystem for all the creatures of mind,&rdquo; he was
interrupted by Cliff Stoll saying, &ldquo;How can you compare the
Internet to an ecology? the Internet is a telephone system!&rdquo;</p><p>Barlow: &ldquo;Clifford, it was a virtual thought.&rdquo;</p><p>Cliff: &ldquo;The Internet is a telephone system that's gotten
uppity.&rdquo;</p><p>The banter continued between the two about interactions on
the Internet versus &ldquo;meet (face-to-face interactions in the real
world) space&rdquo;.</p><p>Barlow told the audience about a project to establish a
virtual conference facility, with a room in Portland, a huge video
screen, and 3-dimensional sound, so that people could see the body
language of people in other places during the conference. Barlow
asked the project coordinator, &ldquo;Ranji, does it work?&rdquo; Ranji said,
&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; Barlow said. &ldquo;What's missing? It looks like you have
everything.&rdquo; Ranji said, &ldquo;But the Prana, the Prana is missing.&rdquo;
Barlow concluded the story for the SCO audience explaining &ldquo;Prana
is the Hindu term for breath and spirit. And I think that the real
enterprise here is to find out whether Prana can ever be fit
through a wire.&rdquo;</p><p>Over one-third of the audience raised their hands in response
to Linus's question, &ldquo;How many of you are actually using Linux or
have used Linux before?&rdquo;</p><p>Linus stated that &ldquo;The most important point I want to say
about the future is that I personally say that the future is the
desktop&mdash;or not even maybe the desktop, but the personal
computer.&rdquo;</p><p>Linus added, &ldquo;if Unix decides to ignore the desktop market
and tries to be a server, even if it's a server that tries to serve
desktops, Unix is eventually going to die. And I think the future
is acknowledging that the desktop market is where it's at.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We all know who's the boss on desktop. Certainly today,
Microsoft is spending probably in excess of 200 million dollars on
making sure who is King of the hill. Right? Is that due to
technical merit? No, no, people on the desktop have been used to
really crappy operating systems. Unix people who're telling us that
they have a technically superior product obviously aren't doing the
right thing, because on the desktop, technology isn't what matters.
What matters is availability and price. So what we like to have,
and what people like to have, [is] cheap and available, and actual
technical merit comes second&mdash;actually, it comes last.&rdquo;</p><p>He went on to mention Free Software, Software Piracy, and of
course, he talked a little about Linux.</p><p>&ldquo;What [Linux] has to give this community is a desktop that
doesn't reboot twice a day&mdash;or more often, if you're doing
something strange like writing a document.&rdquo;</p><p>He took technical and other questions in person after the
discussion, and the two SCO technicians sitting next to me were up
there first to ask him a question. Had I not been late to catch a
plane, I would have stayed a while longer and eavesdropped.</p></div></div>
