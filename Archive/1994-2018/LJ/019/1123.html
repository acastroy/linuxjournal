    The efforts of the Hungry Programmers are making the Motif
    widget set available for Linux users.

Microsoft Windows is that all your applications look and feel the
same. You know that there will be a bar at the top of the window
with some pull-down menus, that Alt-F4 will quit, Ctrl-X will cut,
Ctrl-V will paste, and so on. Even with a brand new piece of
software, everything looks familiar, and you don't have to spend
time getting used to a new user interface before you can start to
use the application.
</p><p>Compare this with the X world, where it seems that no two
applications look the same, and you often have to spend a few
minutes familiarizing yourself with the controls, even with
programs you have used before. Why is there such a difference in
the appearance of X applications, when it could be argued that the
Graphical User Interface (GUI) of a program is one of its most
important parts?</p><p>The most basic tool for X programmers is Xlib, the X
programmer library. It effectively hides the details of the X
protocol from the programmer in a library of C subroutines.
However, Xlib routines are very low level. The idea behind Xlib is
to give the programmer a convenient environment while offering the
full flexibility of the X window system. In particular, the
programmer has to implement his/her own user interface. There are
two important consequences of this. Firstly, there is a lot of work
for the programmer, since common components such as scrollbars,
buttons, etc. have to be written from scratch. Secondly, it means
that different applications look and feel very different, since
programmers implement their own GUIs according to their own
personal taste.</p><p>The designers of X addressed the first problem by providing
Xt, the X Window toolkit. This provides a set of functions that
handle the user interface and other X-related sections of an
application program, such as window creation and event handling. Xt
provides routines at a higher level than Xlib, making life easier
for the programmer. Although Xt is written in C, it has an
object-orientated approach to the problem. The functions in Xt
appear as self contained program units called widgets. Widgets are
arranged in classes, and each widget class performs one particular
type of task. Some widget classes provide the on-screen GUI
components (scroll bars, buttons etc.), while others assist with
managing the overall layout of the GUI. For example, the HTML
interpreter of NCSA Mosaic is implemented as a (very complicated)
widget.</p><p>Xt consists of two layers, the Intrinsics layer which
provides an environment in which widgets can be created and
managed, and the widgets themselves, which are usually packaged as
a widget library. Several widget libraries exist, the most
commonplace being the Athena widget library, which is provided as a
part of X as an example widget set. The Athena widget library has
been widely used, especially in public domain software, because it
is widely available and free. Unfortunately, it consists of only a
few basic widgets, which are often considered to be quite
ugly.</p><p>A well developed and popular widget set is provided by the
Open Systems Foundation as part of OSF/Motif. Motif provides
literally hundreds of widgets, and is used in a lot of X
application software. The recent cross-vendor COSE agreement
describes a GUI style which is heavily based on Motif. One possible
consequence of this agreement is that we could start to see X
applications with a consistent look and feel, even though they are
running on different hardware with different operating systems.
This would help shake off some of the antipathy that is directed at
the X window system.</p><p>There is a danger that all this could pass the Linux
community by. Motif is typically bundled with commercial Unix/X
systems, but since it is a commercial product, it does not come as
part of XFree86. Several versions of Motif are available for Linux
users, retailing in the region of $100&mdash;$200, but it is probably
fair to say that most Linux users are quite happy to do without
Motif, rather than pay for it. After all, we have a free operating
system, a free C compiler, a free DOS emulator, a free windowing
system, and so on. $100 for Motif? No, thanks.</p><p>However, Motif is already the de facto standard in the rest
of the Unix world, and the reliance on Motif is likely to increase
with the COSE agreement. While it is possible (depending on their
licensing arrangements) for vendors to distribute statically
compiled binaries of applications that use Motif, it would be
preferable for everyone to have their own copy of the library. It
is highly unlikely that the OSF is going to make Motif available
free to Linux users, but this is where LessTif comes in.</p><p>LessTif is an active project of a group called the Hungry
Programmers. It is intended to be a free widget set with exactly
the same look and feel as the Motif library. More importantly, it
will be source code compatible with Motif, so that the same source
will compile with both libraries and work exactly the same. At the
time of writing, the current focus is on getting the functionality
of the Motif 1.2 widgets. When that is done, the intention is to
add some of the features of Motif 2.0, and possibly other
extensions. The speed of development of the code is quite
astonishing. New releases are made weekly, and there is an active
mailing list where patches and improvements are sent in the
meantime. The main developer of LessTif is Chris Toshok of the
Hungry Programmers, but many others are contributing to the
project, and new contributors and bug reports are welcome.</p><p>The developers of LessTif are working only from descriptions
of Motif 1.2 available in books and header files&mdash;they have no
access to the &ldquo;real&rdquo; Motif source. Some of the developers have
Motif libraries, so they cay compile applications against both
libraries and compare the results. At the time of writing, LessTif
still is at alpha status&mdash;we are still a long way from being able
to compile and run most Motif applications using LessTif. There is
a list of programs known to compile, link, and run with LessTif,
but it is quite short at the moment. Other programs compile and
link, but are still a long way from being usable. It is unrealistic
to expect the developers to be able to give firm release dates,
since for most (all?) of them, LessTif is a spare time project, but
the developers hope that a usable release will be available in the
reasonably near future; perhaps even this year. It looks very
likely that the LessTif project will eventually succeed in its
aims, and that Linux users will have access to a free Motif-like
library.</p><p>The combination of the Xt toolkit with a suitable widget set
still only addresses part of the problem. It provides the
programmer with the building blocks for a user interface, but the
responsibility for actually constructing the interface still lies
with the developers of each individual application. In recent
years, users have come to expect many features from their programs,
such as context-sensitive on-line help, drag-and-drop facilities,
and inter-application communication&mdash;and they expect to see them
work the same way between different applications.</p><p>While there are guidelines for constructing such high-level
elements, such as the OSF/Motif style guide, these guidelines are
often written without consideration of the tools available to the
programmer. Without a suitable set of tools with which to work,
each developer will inevitably interpret the guidelines differently
as they implement a user interface from the lower level building
blocks provided by Xt and a widget library. Another factor is that
the widget set being used may pre-date the style guidelines the
programmer is attempting to follow, so that the widgets available
may not be suited to the tasks at hand. What is needed, then, is a
still higher-level toolkit which is tailored to the specific task
of providing a GUI, and which enables the programmer to provide the
features the user expects in a consistent fashion. These higher
level objects are known as application frameworks.</p><p>Application frameworks have been used successfully on
Macintosh and Windows systems, which is why there is such
similarity between applications in each of those environments.
Until recently, application frameworks have not been common in Unix
environments, but that is beginning to change.</p><p>Silicon Graphics provides an application framework called the
IRIS ViewKit (TM) with their workstations. The ViewKit is not
intended to be a stand-alone library, but instead is meant to be
used in combination with the Motif library. This gives software
developers the ease, power, and consistency of the higher level
objects, but allows them the full low-level flexibilty of the Motif
widgets should they need it. This approach helps avoid the main
danger of application frameworks&mdash;that the desired behaviour of
the application has to be compromised in order to work within the
framework.</p><p>As workstation vendors provide these application frameworks,
the gap between the Unix environments and the personal computer
environments should begin to narrow. Again, there is a danger that
Linux will become the poor relation of the Unix world.</p><p>The Hungry Programmers are also busy attempting to ameliorate
this problem by developing a free application framework which can
be used on Linux. Called the Hungry ViewKit, it is a C++ class
library for developing Motif applications which follows the API of
the IRIS ViewKit. It is intended to be a superset of the Silicon
Graphics kit, so that all code developed for the IRIS version will
work will the Hungry kit, but not necessarily vice versa.</p><p>The LessTif project is in fact a spin-off from the
development of the Hungry ViewKit. While working on the Hungry
ViewKit and XWord (a word processor being developed for the X
window system) the Hungry Programmers felt that there was too much
reliance on the Motif widget set, and decided that they should
implement a look- and feel-alike.</p><p>At the moment, there is no documentation available for the
Hungry ViewKit, but the XWord source is available as an example of
its use. Work on XWord has been given a higher priority than fixing
bugs on the ViewKit. Thus, while a release of the Hungry ViewKit is
available, it is not yet for the faint-hearted.</p><p>[Author's Note: As is the nature of the Web, the URLs I gave
