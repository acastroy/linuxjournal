command is one of the original Unix utilities and should be in
everyone's tool box. It can strip headers, extract parts of binary
files and write into the middle of floppy disks; it is used by the
Linux kernel Makefiles to make boot images. It can be used to copy
and convert magnetic tape formats, convert between ASCII and
EBCDIC, swap bytes, and force to upper and lowercase.
</p><p>For blocked I/O, the dd command has no competition in the
standard tool set. One could write a custom utility to do specific
I/O or formatting but, as dd is already available almost
everywhere, it makes sense to use it.</p><p>Like most well-behaved commands, dd reads from its standard
input and writes to its standard output, unless a command line
specification has been given. This allows dd to be used in pipes,
and remotely with the <b  >rsh</b> remote shell
command.</p><p>Unlike most commands, dd uses a keyword=value format for its
parameters. This was reputedly modeled after IBM System/360 JCL,
which had an elaborate DD &ldquo;Dataset Definition&rdquo; specification for
I/O devices. A complete listing of all keywords is available from
GNU dd with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd --help
</pre><p>Some people believe dd means &ldquo;Destroy Disk&rdquo; or &ldquo;Delete
Data&rdquo; because if it is misused, a partition or output file can be
trashed very quickly. Since dd is the tool used to write disk
headers, boot records, and similar system data areas, misuse of dd
has probably trashed many hard disks and file systems.</p><p>In essence, dd copies and optionally converts data. It uses
an input buffer, conversion buffer if conversion is specified, and
an output buffer. Reads are issued to the input file or device for
the size of the input buffer, optional conversions are applied, and
writes are issued for the size of the output buffer. This allows
I/O requests to be tailored to the requirements of a task. Output
to standard error reports the number of full and short blocks read
and written.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2350580.0x2448818"></a>Example 1</h2></div></div><p>A typical task for dd is copying a floppy disk. As the common
geometry of a 3.5" floppy is 18 sectors per track, two heads and 80
cylinders, an optimized dd command to read a floppy is:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Example 1a: Copying from a 3.5"
floppy:</b></span><b  >dd bs=2x80x18b if=/dev/fd0
of=/tmp/floppy.image1+0 records in1+0 records out</b></p><p>The <b  >18b</b> specifies 18 sectors of 512 bytes,
the 2x multiplies the sector size by the number of heads, and the
80x is for the cylinders&mdash;a total of 1474560 bytes. This issues a
single 1474560-byte read request to /dev/fd0 and a single 1474560
write request to /tmp/floppy.image, whereas a corresponding
<span   class="bold"><b>cp</b></span> command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp /dev/fd0 /tmp/floppy.image
</pre><p>issues 360 reads and writes of 4096 bytes. While this may
seem insignificant on a 1.44MB file, when larger amounts of data
are involved, reducing the number of system calls and improving
performance can be significant.</p><p>This example also shows the factor capability in the GNU dd
number specification. This has been around since before the
Programmers Work Bench and, while not documented in the GNU dd man
page, is present in the source and works just fine, thank
you.</p><p>To finish copying a floppy, the original needs to be ejected,
a new diskette inserted, and another dd command issued to write to
the diskette:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Example 1b: Copying</b></span> to a
3.5" floppy<b  >dd bs=2x80x18b &lt; /tmp/floppy.image &gt;
/dev/fd01+0 records in1+0 records out</b></p><p>Here is shown the stdin/stdout usage, in which respect dd is
like most other utilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2350580.0x2448df0"></a>Example 2</h2></div></div><p>The original need for dd came with the 1/2" tapes used to
exchange data with other systems and boot and install Unix on the
PDP/11. Those days are gone, but the 9-track format lives. To
access the venerable 9-track, 1/2" tape, dd is superior. With
modern SCSI tape devices, blocking and unblocking are no longer a
necessity, as the hardware reads and writes 512-byte data
blocks.</p><p>However, the 9-track 1/2" tape format allows for variable
length blocking and can be impossible to read with the cp command.
The dd command allows for the exact specification of input and
output block sizes, and can even read variable length block sizes,
by specifying an input buffer size larger than any of the blocks on
the tape. Short blocks are read, and dd happily copies those to the
output file without complaint, simply reporting on the number of
complete and short blocks encountered.</p><p>Then there are the EBCDIC datasets transferred from such
systems as MVS, which are almost always 80-character blank-padded
Hollerith Card Images! No problem for dd, which will convert these
to newline-terminated variable record length ASCII. Making the
format is just as easy and dd again is the right tool for the
job.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Example 2: Converting EBCDIC
80-character fixed-length record to ASCII variable-length
newline-terminated record</b></span><b  >dd bs=10240 cbs=80
conv=ascii,unblock if=/dev/st0 of=ascii.out40+0 records in38+1
records out</b></p><p>The fixed record length is specified by the cbs=80 parameter,
and the input and output block sizes are set with bs=10240. The
EBCDIC-to-ASCII conversion and fixed-to-variable record length
conversion are enabled with the conv=ascii,noblock
parameter.</p><p>Notice the output record count is smaller than the input
record count. This is due to the padding spaces eliminated from the
output file and replaced with newline characters.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2350580.0x2449160"></a>Example 3</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes data arrives from sources in unusual formats. For
example, every time I read a tape made on an SGI machine, the bytes
are swapped. The dd command takes this in stride, swapping the
bytes as required. The ability to use dd in a pipe with rsh means
that the tape device on any *nix system is accessible, given the
proper rlogin setup.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Example 3: Byte Swapping with Remote
Access of Magnet Tape:</b></span><b  >rsh sgi.with.tape dd
bs=256b if=/dev/rmt0 conv=swab | tar xvf -</b></p><p>The dd runs on the SGI and swaps the bytes before writing to
the tar command running on the local host.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2350580.0x24493c8"></a>Example 4</h2></div></div><p>Murphy's Law was postulated long before digital computers,
but it seems it was specifically targeted for them. When you need
to read a floppy or tape, it is the only copy in the universe and
you have a deadline past due, that is when you will have a bad spot
on the magnetic media, and your data will be unreadable. To the
rescue comes dd, which can read all the good data around the bad
spot and continue after the error is encountered. Sometimes this is
all that is needed to recover the important data.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Example 4: Error
Handlingi:</b></span><b  >dd bs=265b conv=noerror if=/dev/st0
of=/tmp/bad.tape.image</b></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2350580.0x24495d8"></a>Example 5</h2></div></div><p>The Linux kernel Makefiles use dd to build the boot image. In
the Alpha Makefile /usr/src/linux/arch/alpha/boot/Makefile, the
srmboot target issues the command:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Example 5. Kernel Image
Makefile:</b></span><b  >dd if=bootimage of=$(BOOTDEV) bs=512
seek=1 skip=1</b></p><p>This skips the first 512 bytes of the input bootimage file
(skip=1) and writes starting at the second sector of the $(BOOTDEV)
device (seek=1). A typical use of dd is to skip executable headers
and begin writing in the middle of a device, skipping volume and
partition data. As this can cause your disk to lose file system
data, please test and use these applications with care.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2350580.0x2449840"></a>Credits</h2></div></div><p>The dd command has been around since the 1970s, ported to
many systems, rewritten many times, and tested by time as a useful
tool. The current Linux version is GNU dd GNU fileutils 3.12,
