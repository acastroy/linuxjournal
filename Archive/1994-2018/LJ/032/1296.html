    Phil Zimmermann's PGP program was written primarily to
    allow people to be quite sure their private communications
    remain private. The messages are encrypted so that only the
    intended recipient is able to read them&mdash;as long as users have
    read the manual and paid heed to its security warnings. Pretty
    Good Privacy.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x19893f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Lurking is a time-honored practice. If
you don't want to seem foolish when you join a newsgroup, you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>lurk</em></span> there, reading articles without posting
any, learning what is expected of participants in that newsgroup.
The same goes for mailing lists. Some people never quit
lurking&mdash;and on the Internet, and on Usenet, that's all right.
</p><p>While reading Usenet news or a mailing list, you have
probably seen a PGP-signed message. It looks something like this
(the signature has been slightly modified to fit in the
magazine):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
This is an example PGP-signed message.
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
Version: 2.6.2

</pre><p>You can read the message just fine by ignoring all the
PGP-specific stuff. But you can also make use of it by learning a
few simple commands&mdash;and learning <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> to use
them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x19896b8"></a>Simple Security?</h2></div></div><p>Are you intimidated by PGP's manual? Perhaps you should be.
Unlike other software products, with which it is Okay to fool
around in order to learn it piece by piece as you need it,
cryptographic software needs to be well-understood to be truly
secure. Using it incorrectly can give you a feeling of
security&mdash;but that's worse than not using it at all, because with
that false sense of security, you will use it to send sensitive
information that you would never have dreamed of sending via e-mail
otherwise. The manual section on key management isn't that long,
but you do have to understand it, and to do that, you do need to
read quite a bit of the manual.</p><p>If you want to write PGP-encrypted e-mail, you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> to read the manual. This article can't
substitute for the manual in teaching you how to keep your e-mail
private. You have your choice of the free manual distributed with
the source code, the printed version of the official manual sold by
MIT Press, or the O'Reilly book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>PGP: Pretty Good
Privacy</em></span>, ISBN 1-56592-098-8, written by Simson
Garfinkel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x19898c8"></a>So Why Read This Article?</h2></div></div><p>So you can &ldquo;PGP-lurk&rdquo;. You don't have to send PGP-encrypted
e-mail in order to take advantage of PGP signatures; you can simply
verify that messages sent by other people are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> sent by them, and not by someone else
masquerading as them. But in order to do that, you really need a
little bit of background. Don't worry, this won't hurt a
bit...</p><p>PGP is based on <span   class="bold"><b>public key
cryptography</b></span>. Each person has a public key that everyone
else needs to know, and a private key which must not be known by
anyone else. A message is encrypted with both the sender's private
key and the recipient's public key. The message can only be
decrypted with the recipient's private key, which only the
recipient knows.</p><p>It is possible, however, to simply <span   class="emphasis"><em>sign</em></span>
a message without encrypting it. The sender's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>private</em></span> key is used to sign the message, and
the sender's <span   class="emphasis"><em>public</em></span> key is used to validate
the signature. Notice that the recipient doesn't need any keys at
all to validate a signature. As long as recipients are able to
trust that their copies of the sender's public key are correct,
they can trust the signature.</p><p>Since you don't need to protect the secrecy of a private key
in order to use PGP to validate signatures, you don't need to read
a book to learn how create a private key and keep it secret. You
just need to know how to find other people's public keys and know
how to use PGP to check signatures.</p><p>If you have read the newsgroup comp.os.linux.announce, you
will have noticed by now that every message posted there is
&ldquo;digitally signed by the moderator, using PGP&rdquo;. Lars Wirzenius,
the moderator, allows you to be sure that he approved the articles
for posting by PGP-signing them. In his signature, he states,
&ldquo;Finger wirzeniu@kruuna.helsinki.fi for PGP key needed for
validating signature.&rdquo; If you run the command <b  >finger
wirzeniu@kruuna.helsinki.fi</b>, you will see something
resembling <a href="1296l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. Don't type
that key in from the listing; if the key is going to do you any
good, you will be able to get it over the internet. If you don't
like finger, you can get it from his home page,
<a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/~wirzeniu/" target="_self">www.cs.helsinki.fi/~wirzeniu/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x1989df0"></a>I'm Still Not Convinced</h2></div></div><p>If the possibility of a forged posting on the
comp.os.linux.announce newsgroup doesn't worry you enough to make
you want to install PGP, consider another situation. Suppose you
see a newsgroup posting or e-mail message that looks like it is
from Ted Ts'o (one of the main Linux developers), and which claims
that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A security hole has been found in Linux,</p></li><li><p>It is being exploited by crackers who are
destroying the systems they crack into,</p></li><li><p>An attached kernel patch will solve the problem,
and</p></li><li><p>You should install the patch on your system(s) as
soon as possible.</p></li></ul></div><p>Further suppose that the patch is beyond your comprehension.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Do you install the patch?</em></span> Let's assume that
Ted is trustworthy (a pretty good assumption). How do you know that
it is really Ted who made the posting or sent the message? Perhaps
the patch really <span   class="bold"><b>creates</b></span> a
security hole through which a cracker could attack, and a cracker
is forging the message and pretending to be Ted in order to
convince you to apply the patch.</p><p>You can know because Ted PGP-signed his patch, and because
you have a copy of his public key. No one could sign it correctly
without a copy of his private key, and Ted is a security expert who
keeps his private key very safe.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x198a370"></a>Getting Keys</h2></div></div><p>In order to check a PGP-signed message, you need to have the
public key. Where do you get the key? You want to get the real
user's real key, not a fake one produced by a forger who is using
the fake key to impersonate the sender.</p><p>Fundamentally, you need to get the key from a different
source than the message. News and mail are notoriously insecure;
anyone can fake an e-mail or news message, and anyone who wants to
read this article to learn about PGP will probably not notice that
the message is fake, and probably won't know how to tell the
difference.</p><p>If someone is forging messages that are supposed to look like
they come from someone else, and they are including PGP, they will
also be attempting to propagate a fake key for the user as whom
they are masquerading. This means that in an ideal world, you will
collect public keys <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> you need to use
them to verify a message. However, there's a good chance that you
don't have the key yet when you want to read the message. Where do
you look to find a key, and how do you know that it is
correct?</p><p>Sometimes you can get a key from someone's home page on the
Web. If you do that, you have to weigh the possibility that someone
has broken security on that system and corrupted the key there. If
you get the key well before you want to verify a suspicious
message, chances are pretty good that the key you get will be good.
The same goes for keys retrieved via finger. If you think you will
ever want to verify a comp.os.linux.announce posting, get the key
now. If you are paranoid, keep checking for the next few days to
make sure there is no announcement that the key was forged or
compromised.</p><p>One place to find lots of PGP keys is on
<span   class="bold"><b>BAL's PGP Public Key Server</b></span>, at
<a href="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/pks-toplev.html" target="_self">www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/pks-toplev.html</a>.
This web site has a large database of public keys, and the person
you are looking for may have submitted the public key to the
database. There's no security; anyone could post an update to
anyone else's public key, even forgeries. You still have to verify
the keys you get from BAL's server; it's only a convenient point of
exchange.</p><p>None of these techniques ensure that the key you get is good.
All security is a matter of degree, and this technique provides,
for most purposes, a <span   class="emphasis"><em>reasonable</em></span> level of
assurance that you have the right key. Don't bet the family fortune
on it.</p><p>Essentially, PGP allows you to <span   class="emphasis"><em>extend</em></span>
trust you already have. If you trust your brother to tell you the
truth in person, and <span   class="bold"><b>he</b></span> has
verified that your copy of his PGP public key is correct, then you
can be rather sure that a message that is correctly signed with his
private key really comes from him. You can be only as sure of that,
however, as of his ability to keep his private key secret.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x198a898"></a>Signed Keys</h2></div></div><p>If your brother is sure that his copy of Joe's public key is
correct, and you trust your brother to give you a good copy of
Joe's public key, then you can be fairly sure that a message that
is signed with Joe's public key really comes from Joe. This is a
very useful notion, and PGP supports it.</p><p>To verify that he is positive that Joe's public key really
belongs to Joe, your brother can <span   class="emphasis"><em>sign the key</em></span>
with his own private key. If you are certain that your copy of your
brother's public key is correct, and your brother has signed Joe's
public key, then <span   class="emphasis"><em>if you trust your brother's judgement in
verifying keys</em></span> you can be mostly sure that your copy of
Joe's public key is correct. Now that you know Joe's key, if you
trust <span   class="emphasis"><em>his</em></span> judgement, you can be reasonably
confident of the veracity of public keys which
<span   class="emphasis"><em>he</em></span> has signed.</p><p>PGP users have organized PGP-key-signing gatherings (parties,
BOF (Birds of a Feather) sessions at conferences, whatever) in
order to meet face to face and sign each other's keys. As people go
to different gatherings in different places, it becomes easier and
easier to say, &ldquo;I trust my brother, and my brother has signed
Joe's key, and Joe has signed Jean's key, so I can be pretty sure
that this message signed with Jean's key is really from Jean.&rdquo;
This concept has become known as the &ldquo;web of trust&rdquo;.</p><p>Don't go off the deep end when it comes to the web of trust.
PGP doesn't make people trustworthy. As Zimmermann says in the PGP
manual, &ldquo;Trust is not necessarily transferable; I have a friend
who I trust not to lie. He's a gullible person who trusts the
President not to lie. That doesn't mean I trust the President not
to lie. This is just common sense.&rdquo; If you don't trust someone
about other things, there's no reason to trust their signatures of
other people's keys. They may be duped or careless or lying
themselves.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x198ac08"></a>Verifying Keys</h2></div></div><p>When people verify that their copy of someone else's key is
correct, they don't laboriously check 1000-10000 characters of the
ASCII representation of the key. Instead, they compare an
abbreviated form called a <span   class="emphasis"><em>fingerprint</em></span>. Each
key is verified by its fingerprint, which is represented by 32
hexadecimal characters. The possibility of two keys having the same
fingerprint is so close to nil that you don't even have to consider
it. So if the fingerprints match, the keys match.</p><p>Before checking fingerprints, it is best to quickly check the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ID</em></span>. The ID is even more abbreviated; it
consists of only 8 hexadecimal characters. If, for instance, a user
uses two different sets of PGP keys, the ID is used to
differentiate between them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x1d83068"></a>Examples</h2></div></div><p>Since we started with comp.os.linux.announce, let's show how
you can easily retrieve the public key for verifying those
messages. (I assume that you have PGP installed. If you don't, I'll
explain later how to do that. I just want to keep things simple for
now.)</p><p>PGP normally tries to do the right thing without being told.
If you feed it a public key, it figures that you want to add it to
your &ldquo;public key ring&rdquo;, available for inspection or use at any
time. Normally, you call it with the name of a file, so try
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
finger wirzeniu@kruuna.helsinki.fi &gt; /tmp/cola
pgp /tmp/cola
</pre><p>If PGP complains &ldquo;Key ring file
'<span   class="emphasis"><em>home</em></span>/.pgp/pubring.pgp' cannot be created&rdquo;,
then you should create the directory ~/.pgp and try again:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir ~/.pgp
pgp /tmp/cola
rm /tmp/cola
</pre><p>PGP will ask if you want to add the key to your public key
ring; answer yes. When it asks whether you want to certify any keys
yourself, answer no. You can't do that without having created your
own public and private key. You will still be able to verify
messages, but you can't use some of PGP's built-in features. This
will look like <a href="1296l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>The comp.os.linux.announce key is now on your public key
ring, and you can now use it to verify posts made to
comp.os.linux.announce.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x1d83430"></a>Checking Signed Messages</h2></div></div><p>Now let's try checking the signature on a message posted to
comp.os.linux.announce. Using your newsreader, save a message to a
file, preferably with the extension &ldquo;.asc&rdquo; (short for ascii).
Let's save it in the file cola.asc, and then call PGP to check the
signature:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b>pgp cola.asc</b></span>
</pre><p>PGP is verbose (as usual), and checks the signature. Part of
what it says lets us know that the signature checks out Okay&mdash;but
it warns that it can't be sure, because you don't have a key of
your own:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
File has signature.  Public key is required to
check signature.  <span   class="bold"><b>Good signature from user
"Lars Wirzenius &lt;wirzeniu@cs.helsinki.fi&gt;".</b></span>
Signature made 1996/05/01 11:36 GMT
WARNING: Because this public key is not certified
with a trusted signature, it is not known with
high confidence that this public key actually
belongs to:
"Lars Wirzenius &lt;wirzeniu@cs.helsinki.fi&gt;".
</pre><p>If you want to get rid of that warning, you will have to
create your own keys, and before you do that, you ought to read the
manual and understand it.</p><p>PGP also saves a copy of the message without the signature in
a file called cola&mdash;it strips the .asc from the filename. If you
had saved the original message in a file named &ldquo;cola&rdquo;, it would
have asked you for a different filename to put the unsigned message
in. Unfortunately, at the present time, the only way to check a
signature without creating a new file containing the unsigned text
is to press CTRL-C when PGP stops to ask you what to do.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x1d837a0"></a>Checking Fingerprints</h2></div></div><p>In order to verify that your copy of a key is the right one,
you need to put the key on your keyring, and then use PGP to print
its fingerprint. Use the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pgp -kvvc <span   class="emphasis"><em>user_id</em></span>
</pre><p>where <b  ><i><tt>user_id</tt></i></b>
is either part of the recipient's e-mail address or the actual
8-character key ID. <a href="1296l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>
shows part of the output of this command for the key used to sign
Announcements of the Linux Emergency Response Team (ALERTs), which
are used to announce security issues related to Linux. This
(<b  >-kvvc</b>) shows a lot of information for each key;
you can get a more concise listing with the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
pgp -kvc <span   class="emphasis"><em>user_id</em></span>
</pre><p>Now try to print the fingerprint for the key Lars uses to
sign comp.os.linux.announce postings. You can check it
below.</p><p>Once you have generated the fingerprint, you need to compare
it to a trusted version. That might mean the fingerprints listed in
this article, or it might mean calling the sender on the phone, or
it might include a fingerprint listed in a book. There are many
options&mdash;it's up to you to judge if the option you choose provides
good enough verification for your purposes.</p><p>Here is a list of IDs and fingerprints for important and
useful keys in the Linux world:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Lars Wirzenius's comp.os.linux.announce

there to help you read the fingerprint, and the fingerprint is the

key IDs and fingerprints in the CREDITS file in the Linux kernel
source code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x1d841f0"></a>Pretty Good Privacy</h2></div></div><p>There's a pretty good chance that after using PGP to quietly
verify signatures for a few years, you will at some point want to
use it for its original purpose&mdash;privacy. Perhaps you want to send
a password to someone. Maybe you simply want to send your credit
card over the Internet. You don't have to be a hero of the
information underground to want to keep your mail private; there
are many prosaic reasons as well. If you are already used to using
PGP to verify signatures, you will not find it difficult to learn
how to use PGP to encrypt your email. Just read the manual
carefully so that your communications are truly secure.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1891580.0x1d842f8"></a>Installing PGP</h2></div></div><p>Installing PGP is a bit of a mess, partially because there is
a patent that is honored in the US and Canada on the public key
algorithm used, and partially because of the US's insane ITAR
regulations. If this were an editorial, I'd have a lot to say about
how incredibly stupid the US government is acting in this case, but
this isn't an editorial, so I won't say a word on the
subject...</p><p>If you have Red Hat Commercial Linux, life is easy. You can
install PGP from an RPM available via anonymous ftp from
ftp.hacktic.nl in the /pub/replay/pub/redhat/ directory. For those
outside the US, you can use either the US version or the
international version; for those in the US, you can only legally
use the US version because of patent law. As of this writing, the
current version number of both versions is 2.6.3, and you just have
to choose between pgp-2.6.3i-1.i386.rpm (the international version)
and pgp-2.6.3usa-2.i386.rpm (the US version). There are also README
files in that directory that explain the situation more fully. You
also get one more benefit: since version 3.0.3 was released, all
official RPM's created by Red Hat are PGP-signed so that you know
you have the official version. Installing PGP will allow that
feature to work.</p><p>Life is also easy if you use Debian. There are .deb files
available for both the international and US versions available in
the non-free directory of selected archive sites. If you live
outside the US, please download your copy from a Debian archive
outside of the US to avoid causing Debian legal trouble. You can
get a list of archive sites by connecting to ftp.debian.org with
ftp. As of this writing, the file you want is pgp-i-2.6.2i-5.deb
(the international version) or pgp-us-2.6.2i-5.deb (the US
version). A new version using the ELF binary file format will
probably be available with the ELF-based Debian 1.1 when it is
released.</p><p>With other distributions, you will probably have to build PGP
from source. You can get the source via ftp from net-dist.mit.edu
in the /pub/PGP/ directory. However, MIT makes you jump through
several hoops to make sure that you are really a US resident to
protect themselves from over-eager US law enforcement officials.
Instructions for building PGP are included, and I wish you good
luck.</p><p>Warning: Within the US, you can use the free version of PGP
only for non-commercial purposes. For commercial purposes, you are
required to buy a copy of ViaCrypt's PGP. You can reach ViaCrypt at
<a href="mailto:viacrypt@acm.org">viacrypt@acm.org</a> or
(800)536-2664, or you can buy the product from the company that
originally ported ViaCrypt's PGP to Linux, SSC
(<i  >LJ</i>'s publisher).</p><p>Michael K. Johnson is only slightly paranoid... His public
key ID and fingerprint are listed above; his public key is
registered with Bal's public key server.</p></div></div>
