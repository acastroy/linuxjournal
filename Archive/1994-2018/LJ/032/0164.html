    Ready to get your news the high-tech way&mdash;with a satellite
    dish?  Here's the scoop.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe3580.0x20db4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article is a discussion of several
aspects of my company's news system, namely the principles of
operation and the hardware and software utilized, in order to guide
the novice news seeker through a successful implementation of
Pagesat's High Speed News feed. Our &ldquo;wish&rdquo; list for a news system
included:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A low-cost solution that would not impact local
network traffic or chew up our Internet bandwidth</p></li><li><p>A system that could be monitored and modified
remotely</p></li><li><p>A system that could support more than just a few
simultaneous news readers</p></li><li><p>A system that worked
<span   class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p>The news system that we have now set up is comprised of four
major components:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Pagesat High Speed News antennae and
receiver</p></li><li><p>News &ldquo;receiver&rdquo; machine connected to high-speed
receiver, Ethernet and SLIP attached</p></li><li><p>Master news machine, Ethernet attached</p></li><li><p>Slave news machine, Ethernet attached</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe3580.0x20dbc90"></a>Software</h2></div></div><p>All three news machines run Slackware Linux 1.2.8 as the
operating system. INN 1.4 processes the news feed. We are currently
using the &ldquo;hsdist2.0b.tar&rdquo; software to decode data from the
receiver. This software contains &ldquo;Forward Error Correction&rdquo; code,
which eliminates or drastically reduces data loss caused by
less-than-perfect satellite reception.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe3580.0x20dbd98"></a>Hardware</h2></div></div><p>We have three Intel-based machines. The receiver machine is a
486-33, 8MB RAM, 500M IDE HD. The master news machine is a little
beefier: a P133 with 32MB RAM, 1GB SCSI for the OS, 4GB fast
SCSI-II to retain the news hierarchy and data files, and another
4GB fast SCSI-II to contain INN and other toys. The relationship of
news and the disk subsystem is simple&mdash;both should be big and fast.
At the current rate, starting from scratch, my 4GB disk is full of
news in 5.5 days. We use the Buslogic BT-456-C PCI SCSI controller
because it is twice as fast as the 16-bit Adaptec 1542C. Having the
Buslogic helps in particular on the daily expire, which went from
3+ hours to a mere 35 minutes. All the machines are
Ethernet-attached, and one of the machines has a modem for remote
control. The slave machine is just that&mdash;a slave. It's identical to
the master in hardware configuration, and just receives everything
that the master &ldquo;feeds&rdquo; it, which is everything. Why do we have
it? In a pinch it can be configured as the &ldquo;master&rdquo;, just in case
some disaster strikes the master, and it can also be used as a
primary or secondary news reader machine for all our
clients.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe3580.0x20dbea0"></a>Principles of Operation</h2></div></div><p>The number one rule is to keep operation straightforward and
simple. Cron-managed batch jobs were our choice: I can't write C
code, but I can write simple shell scripts. I wanted a little more
monitoring capability, so I added extra processing to the Pagesat
software. We accumulate news for half-hour bursts, then process it
into the news system on the hour and the half hour. It currently
takes, on average, fifteen minutes to process the previous half
hour's data. At 15 and 45 minutes past the hour, we &ldquo;feed&rdquo; the
slave, sending everything we have received to that point. We run a
nightly expire on the master and slave to get rid of the old news
and prepare for the next day. The &ldquo;receiver&rdquo; machine runs both
the PSFRX and PSNEWS programs to receive the data and process it
into the .gz data files. These files are stored on an NFS-mounted
disk r/w to the master. The master copies the files at the
specified intervals onto its disks and deletes them from the
receiver disk. The master then processes the news into the system.
With this configuration we can take down the master machine for
whatever reason and continue to accumulate news on the receiver,
processing it whenever the master comes on-line again.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe3580.0x20dbfa8"></a>Why Does This Make Sense?</h2></div></div><p>Three reasons: it's dirt cheap, it's efficient, it works. Add
it up. The total cost for software is ZERO. Hardware costs are
minimal, because PCs are a lot less expensive than workstations,
and disk drive prices keep dropping every day. And RAM is really
cheap these days&mdash;16MB for $100 or less.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe3580.0x20dc0b0"></a>Silly Alternatives</h2></div></div><p>Have you priced a leased line lately? The cost is maybe $200
a month for a 64KB circuit to pipe your news to you, a circuit that
can't even support a full feed. Want to slurp two or more days of
old news from your provider across your 28.8 AND try to surf AND do
anything else at the same time?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe3580.0x20dc1b8"></a>Ready to Install the Software</h2></div></div><p>If you don't already have your Linux system(s) up and
running, do it now. Run down to your local software house and pick
up a CD-ROM containing the latest version of Linux (I like
Slackware), follow the instructions and get it installed. It's
easy&mdash;all it takes is a little time. Take the extra time needed to
customize your kernel in order to save RAM. Next, get X-Windows up
and running, so that you can monitor several things simultaneously.
Make sure your TCP/IP is working, be it LAN or SLIP/PPP, to allow
posting capability. Now you're ready to set up the news system. We
chose to obtain a source code version of INN off the Internet
rather than use the distributed version. Key files worth reading
are most notably the FAQs in /usr/lib/news/tools.linux, and the
README files in the base directory. These files explore the
configuration options and operating procedures.</p><p>Now it's time to build your news repository. First, fetch the
latest &ldquo;active&rdquo; file from ftp.pagesat.net. Then write a simple
script to strip out and retain the newsgroup name, and append
&ldquo;00000000 000000001 y&rdquo; to each entry to reset the news article
counters. Make your modified file the &ldquo;active&rdquo; file. Now run
/usr/lib/news/bin/makehistory and watch a lot of your disk space be
consumed by the directory structure being built to house the news
data. Next, you will need to edit some of the INN control files in
/usr/lib/news. The following examples are excerpts from our working
files, with explanations. Feel free to copy and/or modify to suit
your configurations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe3580.0x20dc318"></a>File 1: control.ctl</h2></div></div><pre     class="programlisting">

directions. Read the documentation that comes with the dish and
receiver. Grab a compass and protractor, an extension cord and the
tools necessary to assemble the dish. Don't forget a beer or two, a
lawn chair and a friend with two hands to help. Go out into your
yard and plug everything together. Then, using your compass and
protractor, aim the dish in the general direction of the satellite
to obtain a tone signal. This tone will help you orient the dish to
the proper location, so that you can decide where to mount it
permanently&mdash;a position that should be free of current and future
obstructions. Once you get the antenna mounted, attach it to your
computer, and start up PSFRX -v to see if you're pointing at the
correct satellite. If you are, you should see a series of dots
representing data blocks&mdash;it isn't a continuous flow, so be
patient. If you see other characters like C and S, which represent
errors, try re-aiming the dish a little, twisting the LNB for
proper polarization. You really need a friend within earshot to
fine-tune the aiming of the dish. If you're getting data, you're
aimed at the right place. Now you can re-attach the receiver next
to the dish for fine-tuning. Using the tone and meter, you can
really zero in on the satellite. Once done, go back into the house,
and re-attach the receiver to your PC: you're ready to start
receiving the news!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fe3580.0x20dcb58"></a>Feeding Time</h2></div></div><p>Start up INN with /usr/lib/news/etc/rc.news and the PSFRX and
PSNEWS programs. You should start seeing news batches filling up
your spool queue. Set <b  >cron</b> to run the
PROCESSSATNEWS PROGRAM each half hour or so. Pick a time and set
<b  >cron</b> to run <b  >news.daily</b> once a
day. Watch your disk fill up with hundreds of megabytes of news
daily. Now you're a member of the INN crowd; pick your favorite
newsgroups (e.g., biz.pagesat, comp.os.linux.* and news.*) and
start learning more about how to tailor your system to be exactly
as you want it.</p></div></div>
