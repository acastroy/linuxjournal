have every issue. I hesitate to say this, because it sounds like so
much bullshit, but I have always been impressed by how quickly
<i  >LJ</i> came up to speed with quality articles. As
a Unix applications programmer, I read several periodicals, and I
find your nuts-and-bolts approach refreshing, compared to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>DDJ</em></span>'s articles. However, I am writing (if that
is what this form of communication is properly called) to ask for
an improvement in <i  >LJ</i>. Would your editorial
staff please give serious consideration to including articles on
FreeBSD? Especially since it poses no threat to the sales of Linux.
Furthermore, I think it would increase your sales, at least with
some of the programmers that I know.</p><p>&mdash;<a href="mailto:ursa@cris.com">ursa@cris.com</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd6580.0x20ce500"></a>Plenty of Linux</h2></div></div><p>An informal survey made back in <i  >LJ</i>'s
early days suggested the FreeBSD community wasn't interested in a
magazine devoted to FreeBSD, which SSC was contemplating. (Perhaps
things have changed?)</p><p>As far as giving time to FreeBSD within the pages of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, we do have some ideas we're
working on. Right now, though, we've got more material about Linux
than we can print.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fd6580.0x20ce710"></a>Korn Shell</h2></div></div><p>The July '96 issue of <i  >LJ</i> presents the
new Korn shell (ksh93). What is not mentioned (and is not widely
known) is users not interested in commercial support can get Linux,
Sun, etc. binaries for free (src is not available). This includes
not only the ksh binary but also shared libraries and the Tksh
extension for Tcl/Tk. Just check the URL
<a href="http://www.research.att.com/orgs/ssr/book/reuse" target="_self">www.research.att.com/orgs/ssr/book/reuse</a>.
By the way, the book that URL refers to (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical
Reusable Unix Software</em></span>, Krishnamurthy, Wiley 1995), is a
gold mine, describing and providing the source code for gems such
as the dot tool. Dot is a directed graph layout tool, and now I
can't live without it. Recommended.</p><p>&mdash;Alexandre Valente

Know gdb&rdquo; article (September '96) that gdb is capable of setting
hardware watchpoints on &ldquo;only a few workstations&rdquo;. Not only does
the i386 (and beyond) have these capabilities, but current versions
of Linux (1.2.1+) and gdb (4.14+) are able to use this
feature.</p><p>The 386 supports up to four simultaneous hardware watchpoints
which can trigger when a memory location is &ldquo;accessed&rdquo; (read or
written). In Linux gdb, these are the &ldquo;rwatch&rdquo; and &ldquo;awatch&rdquo;
commands. Both commands take an expression to be watched. As the
authors point out, this feature is great for watching a memory
location that is being mysteriously trashed. The advantage with
hardware watchpoints is your program runs at full speed instead of
being slowly single-stepped.</p><p>The one tricky point in dealing with these watchpoints is
they are disabled automatically if program control transfers
outside the scope of the expression. For example, if &ldquo;i&rdquo; is an
automatic variable (a &ldquo;local&rdquo; variable), then when a subroutine
is called, the meaning of &ldquo;i&rdquo; is lost. The workaround is to watch
a raw memory location:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) print &amp;i
$1 = (int *) 0xbffffd2c
(gdb) awatch *((int *) 0xbffffd2c)
Hardware access(read/write) /
watchpoint 3: *(int *) 3221224748
(gdb) cont
Continuing.
Hardware access(read/write) /
watchpoint 3: *(int *) 3221224748

that you are excluding any mention of bugs from your review
articles. Rely on word of mouth? Then why the devil did I just pay
$4.00 for your silly journal!! I know you don't want to offend any
potential advertisers, but this is ridiculous. Until you can be
bothered to report on what these packages are REALLY like, your

July's <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>One free system you did not mention was Exodus (from the now
famous OO7 benchmark debacle with Object Store). I have been using
Exodus for about two years with its E (C++ extension) for
persistence. It is exceptional.</p><p>I note from its archive (cs.uws.edu) the latest version of E
has been removed (based on gcc-2.5.8), maybe because of several
bugs in the release (which I tripped over and have since fixed).
The stable release is based on gcc-2.3.3.</p><p>I have just completed the port of E-2.5.8 to Solaris 2.4
&amp; 5 and should be releasing it, along with the fixes, back to
the archive shortly.</p><p>By the way, Exodus does run under Linux and does support a
very extensive multi-user, multi-server caching system called
&ldquo;sm&rdquo;. sm also supports a two phase commit and
checkpointing.</p><p>I agree about OODB speed differences&mdash;they make systems like
&ldquo;Manacle&rdquo; look like the dinosaurs they are.</p><p>&mdash;Stephen

the <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Your journal is the only
one I read from cover to cover any more. Here are a few opinions
and comments I'd like to pass on:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Please convey to Michael Johnson he did a marvelous
job in getting <i  >LJ</i> started. I always enjoyed
his technical articles, and I wish him well in his new position
with Red Hat.</p></li><li><p>I think your mix of newbie to &ldquo;not so newbie&rdquo;
articles varies a little between issues but, on the whole, is about
right (for me anyway).</p></li><li><p>I think your &ldquo;What is Linux&rdquo; section should
highlight the contributions of the FSF, BSD, MIT and others a
little more prominently. Although their software wasn't written to
support the Linux project (but it does now), Linux would be much
the poorer without them (it doesn't diminish Linux in any way to
provide this acknowledgement).</p></li><li><p>Please continue to run as many articles as possible
on introductions to programming tools under Linux. The &ldquo;Getting to
Know gdb&rdquo; article was a good example of this type of
article.</p></li><li><p>I liked your interview with Linus Torvalds. It
would be very interesting to see more articles in this vein. I
suggest you interview additional Linux luminaries such as Alan Cox,
Werner Almesberger, Matt Welsh, Lars Wirzenius, Remy Card, Rick
Faith, Leonard Zubkoff, Bjorne Ekwall, Al Longyear, Donald Becker,
and many others too numerous to mention.</p></li><li><p>I'd also be quite interested in getting to know a
little more about Linux entrepreneurs like Phil Hughes, Mark
Bolzern, Erik Troan and many others.</p></li><li><p>While I'm on the topic of interviews, a good
complement to the Linux Distributions review article would be short
bios on the founders of the distributions. (I'm particularly
fascinated by the Debian project, its philosophy, and its
contributors.)</p></li><li><p>Interviews with Unix luminaries like Richard
Stallman, Larry Wall and others would also be very
illuminating.</p></li><li><p>An article on the use of Linux for real-time
applications would be interesting. There are a number of groups
working on this, and perhaps you could convince their coordinators
to contribute an article or two.</p></li><li><p>An article surveying free and non-free database
software would be very useful.</p></li></ul></div><p>Well, that's enough opinions and suggestions for one letter!
Keep up the good work!

2.0 and in Mr. Crow's article about them is totally wrong. You
focus only on memory savings. Mr. Crow even goes so far as to
explain that for drivers used permanently, it is better to compile
them in the kernel due to the 2K loss per module when they are
page-aligned&mdash;besides, you lose twelve pages due to kerneld.</p><p>Let me answer this first. If you have 20 modules loaded (an
unrealistically high number) you lose 40K&mdash;add the kerneld and you
are still under 100K. Well, what's the matter? This is Linux, not
stinking DOS. We have no 640K barrier, and 100K will not cause a
noticeable difference in speed (unless you have only 4MB of RAM,
but today this is rare).</p><p>Consider a beginner using 1.2: he must choose from dozens of
boot diskettes the one able to support his hardware. Despite this,
the kernel has so many unnecessary drivers that it is 1MB too big
(and that WILL make an important difference in speed). And despite
being so large, this kernel lacks things he wants, like sound
support. So our beginner (still barely able to copy a file) is
confronted with the task of compiling a new kernel. It is not so
difficult, as we know, but this has an undesirable effect: Linux
gets the reputation of being a &ldquo;hackers only&rdquo; OS&mdash;you can't put
it in the hands of a person without some computing
experience.</p><p>Now consider a (future) 2.0 distribution: only one boot image
(well, perhaps half a dozen, if you want to optimize for Pentiums).
All the drivers are modules. At installation time, the user answers
some questions about his hardware, and the installation procedure
builds the config files for kerneld and /etc/rc.d/conf.modules for
&ldquo;permanent modules&rdquo;. The user reboots and he is running.</p><p>Your kernel is perhaps
<span   class="bold"><b>slightly</b></span> suboptimal, but
recompiling is no longer a requisite. That means handling drivers
in Linux becomes a lot easier than editing CONFIG.SYS or
AUTOEXEC.BAT. Add to this the new package managers, some
configuration tools, and a good file manager&mdash;with a little hand
holding, I now have a hope to rescue my 15-year-old niece from the
clutches of the Evil Empire.</p><p>&mdash;Jean Francois
