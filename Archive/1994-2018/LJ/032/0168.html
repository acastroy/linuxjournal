    Dr. Wampler introdces us to V, an excellent GUI framework
    for writing applications that work with Linux and X Windows.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2893580.0x298b558"></a></h2></div></div><p>I love Linux as a development
platform&mdash;it has all the Unix tools I've been using for years.
Linux has been a superior development platform in every way except
for development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with X. For
some time, programmers using Microsoft Windows have had the option
of using either Microsoft's MFC or Borland's OWL to develop C++ GUI
applications. However, Linux has caught up in the graphics area as
some very good freeware C++ GUI frameworks are now available for X
and Linux. This article is about V, the GUI framework I've written.
</p><p>I first developed V as a tutorial example for a C++ book I'm
writing. My tutorial has turned into a very complete, easy-to-use
C++ GUI framework suitable for developing almost any GUI
application. It works with X and Linux, and uses the standard X
Athena toolkit, so that everything remains free. V uses some
customized versions of the free Athena 3D widget set, so V
applications have a very handsome 3D look. V also works with
Microsoft Windows, so applications you build on Linux with V are
easily ported to MS-Windows, as well as other X platforms. V is
distributed under the GNU Library General Public License, so you
can freely use V to develop either other freeware or proprietary
applications (as long as you make the source of V available to the
end user).</p><p>Two other good frameworks are wxWindows and YACL. While these
two programs have their strong points, I think V is much simpler to
use and has applications that are more user friendly. For more
details, a comparison of V and the other frameworks is posted on my
web page
(<a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~wampler" target="_self">http://www.cs.unm.edu/~wampler/</a>).
All three programs provide much of the functionality of commercial
frameworks such as MFC or OWL.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2893580.0x298b768"></a>Life Without a Framework</h2></div></div><p>If you don't use a GUI library or framework, you are stuck
using the native X toolkits to develop your GUI, either by using X
directly (very hard) or using the Xt Athena or Motif widget sets
(just a bit easier). While you can develop very nice interfaces
using these toolkits directly, there is a steep learning curve. A
good programmer needs at least a month of steady effort to be able
to write programs using either Xt Athena or Motif, and the
applications are limited to X platforms. One of the problems with
the native X toolkits is that they are designed to be totally
flexible, and to handle almost any interface design. This very
generality makes them hard to learn and to use. For most
applications, you simply don't need that much flexibility.</p><p>V, on the other hand, has been designed from the start with
ease of programming in mind. I have received reports from new V
users saying they were able to get their first V applications up
and running in just four or five hours from downloading the V
distribution to ending with a running application. Within a week,
programmers are able to fully use almost every feature of V. Even
the inexperienced programmers in my classes at the University of
New Mexico have learned to program with V in a week.</p><p>The cost for this ease of programming is rather small. For
one thing, you must use V's definition of the GUI elements. When
you use V, you end up with interfaces that conform closely to
standard Motif or Microsoft Windows applications. Also, you lose
some of the low level access and flexibility you have when using
the low-level toolkits. For the vast majority of applications, this
loss is not significant. V does provides hooks for getting at some
of the low-level details, but the only use I've heard made of them
is to interface with OpenGL and Mesa.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2893580.0x298b920"></a>A Standard V Application</h2></div></div><p><a href="0168f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1</a> shows the V Icon
Editor included with the V distribution. The Icon Editor is
representative of a typical V application. The main user interface
element is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>command window</em></span>. The command
window has a menu bar that is the standard drop-down menu found on
most Motif and Windows applications. Below the menu bar are one or
more tool bars that allow you to make the most commonly used
commands readily available to the user. The current trend is to
place buttons with small icons on the tool bar; with V you can use
any standard control object on the tool bar. Under the tool bar is
the drawing canvas where your application shows data, such as text
information, graphical information, or, in this case, the icon to
edit. The drawing canvas can have scroll bars, and the user
interacts with the data displayed on the canvas using the mouse or
keyboard. Below the drawing canvas is a status bar, used to show
useful information, like the mouse position.</p><p>Dialogs are an important part of most GUI programs.
<a href="0168f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2</a> shows the color selection
modeless dialog used with the V Icon Editor. V supports both modal
and modeless dialogs with a complete set of controls.</p><p>I hope you agree that the appearance of this V application is
as good as any other X application you've seen on Linux. Icon
Editor also compiles in Microsoft Windows without a single
<b  >#ifdef</b> and will look just like a standard
Windows application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2893580.0x298bc38"></a>V C++ Objects</h2></div></div><p>V is a C++ framework, and therefore, consists of several C++
base classes you can use to derive your own classes. The core class
is <span   class="bold"><b>vApp</b></span>, which is used as the main
foundation of the rest of the application. A minimal application
has a command window derived from the
<span   class="bold"><b>vCommandWindow</b></span> class containing at
least a menu and a drawing canvas. The command window can also
contain tool and status bars. When the user selects menu items or
activates command objects on the tool bar, V sends messages to your
derived <span   class="bold"><b>vCommandWindow</b></span> object
which your program then interprets. Your program usually shows its
output on a canvas object, derived from a
<span   class="bold"><b>vCanvas</b></span> class. Mouse input is
handled by sending messages to your derived canvas class.</p><p>While it is possible to build an application using only the
<span   class="bold"><b>vApp</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>vCommandWindow</b></span>, and
<span   class="bold"><b>vCanvas</b></span> classes, most applications
will also use dialogs. The dialog controls supported by V currently
include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>standard push button</p></li><li><p>push button with icon and color</p></li><li><p>toggle buttons</p></li><li><p>labels</p></li><li><p>icons</p></li><li><p>check box</p></li><li><p>radio button</p></li><li><p>combo box</p></li><li><p>list</p></li><li><p>spinners</p></li><li><p>slider</p></li><li><p>progress bar</p></li><li><p>text in</p></li><li><p>multi-line text</p></li><li><p>frame (box)</p></li><li><p>toggle frames (similar to tabs)</p></li></ul></div><p>The layout of controls in a dialog is determined by
specifying a position for each control relative to other controls
in the dialog. For example, you might specify one control is to the
right and below another control. All dialog controls can also be
used on the tool bar of a command window.</p><p>V also includes several standard dialogs that implement
common operations. One of the most useful is the file open dialog,
which lets the user select files and directories interactively.
Since no standard X file open dialog exists, V implements its own.
The MS-Windows version of V uses the standard Windows file dialog.
Other standard dialogs include font selection, yes/no response and
a message box. Using standard dialogs helps ensure that your
application will match the look and feel of the native
platform.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2893580.0x298cc08"></a>Building Your First V Application</h2></div></div><p>The first step to using V is obtaining the latest release.
The primary source for V is my web page,
<a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~wampler" target="_self">http://www.cs.unm.edu/~wampler/.</a>
V is also available for anonymous ftp from
ftp://ftp.cs.unm.edu/pub/wampler. Unpack the distribution, decide
where you want to keep the source and libraries, modify the
makefile to reflect this decision and execute make.</p><p>After you've built V, read the documentation. You can either
print it, or use xdvi or ghostscript to view the provided dvi or ps
files. You then typically start your own application by modifying
one of the examples provided. Most new V users find it very easy to
modify the example to get a good start on their own. The entire
process of downloading, building, reading the manual and building a
first custom V application has been done by several current V users
(already familiar with the Internet, Linux and C++) in just four or
five hours.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2893580.0x2d85010"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Since its release to the world in February 1996, V has been
in use by my software engineering class and received considerable
interest and positive response from the user community. If you've
put off writing a GUI application because X programming is just too
hard to learn, V may be the solution you need. If you've been
putting off learning C++, again V may be just what you need. V is a
very elegant, small and well-designed C++ class library. GUIs are
one of the most naturally object-oriented applications around and
are a good way to get started with object-oriented
programming.</p></div></div>
