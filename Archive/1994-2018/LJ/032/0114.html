Darwin Open Systems
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Price:</b></span> $30.00</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Reviewer:</b></span> James
Waldby</p><p>OPEN LOOK is a graphical-user-interface specification. For
example, the Sun OpenWindows windowing environment is based on OPEN
LOOK specifications, while olwm and olvwm are OPEN LOOK window
managers often included with OpenWindows implementations. XView is
an X11 toolkit for developing programs that meet OPEN LOOK
specifications. The &ldquo;Linux GUI Development mini-HOWTO&rdquo; refers to
XView as &ldquo;the poor man's object-oriented toolkit for building OPEN
LOOK applications for X&rdquo; but also says, &ldquo;The XView toolkit
provides extensive attribute-value pair combinations, convenience
routines and object class hierarchies...&rdquo; I comment briefly on
XView vs. Motif later in this review.</p><p>The CD I reviewed was released in mid-1995 by the Darwin Open
Systems company in Ontario, Canada. Priced at USD $30, the CD
contains about 570 megabytes of files, mostly uncompressed. The
principal directories are: src/X11R6/contrib, src/X11R6/xc,
src/xview, book, bin.Linux, NeWS, bin.sun and t viewers. Contents
of some directories are of use only on Suns (bin.sun, of course; a
set of indices for SearchIt; AnswerGarden/xinfo files), but most
files either appear in two forms (Sun OS and Linux) or aren't
OS-specific. A lamentable exception: acroread-msw.exe and
acroread.sun Acrobat/PDF viewers are supplied on the CD&mdash;but no
Acrobat viewer for Linux is supplied.</p><p>One page accompanying the CD describes licensing terms for
its contents, and a second page tells how to mount the CD on your
system and &ldquo;get started&rdquo; with it. You can get a quick overview of
much of the disk using an HTML browser and the provided TOUR
script. The script will use Arena (provided on the CD) if you like,
or any browser you already have. I used both Netscape and Arena to
navigate around the disk.</p><p>The CD contains text and figures of three books, licensed for
personal use. The books are volumes 7A <span   class="emphasis"><em>(XView Programming
Manual)</em></span> and 7B <span   class="emphasis"><em>XView Reference
Manual)</em></span> of the O'Reilly &amp; Associates Guides to the X
Window System series, and an analog of volume 3 <span   class="emphasis"><em>X Window
System User's Guide)</em></span> tailored toward XView instead of
Motif or Athena widgets and windows. Each book appears in two
forms: as single files suitable for Acrobat/PDF viewing, and as
chapter-by-chapter PostScript files for viewing or printing. It is
these three books that make the CD unique, rather than the software
on the disk; most of the software is freely or inexpensively
available on Internet or other CDs. Still, having the software
collected and organized on one CD adds value because that makes it
easier for programmers to study and run several XView-based
applications quickly.</p><p>Documentation on CD has its virtues, the most important in my
view being findability (I often misplace books), transportability
(much lighter than books), and machine readability (for searching
and copying). But on my system (Linux 1.3.81, 486DX2-66 with 32MB
RAM, 17" monitor) ghostview seems clumsy and slow, so I'm not
inclined to recommend the PostScript files on this CD as an online
substitute for printed manuals. Instead, I'd recommend the CD to
persons learning about X11 or XView because it provides a broad set
of example X and XView programs. Now, if all those .ps files were
.html's ...</p><p>The src/X11R6/xc/doc directory subdivides into directories
with many megabytes of troff and PostScript files for X library
descriptions, X specifications, and X man pages. For example,
xlib.PS.Z is a 490-page document about xlib, widgets.PS.Z is 146
pages about Athena widgets, and so forth.</p><p>The src/xview directory leads to source and executable
versions of about 50 XView application programs in categories such
as general, accessories, graphical, networking, administrative,
games, editors, programming tools, and GUI program skeletons.
Applications include (for example) workman, xrolo, xvnews, ftptool,
and mahjongg.</p><p>Many of the HTML pages for the CD tour let you try out
applications easily. For example, the page with URL
file://localhost/CD/src/xview/pan3.0/index.html lets you run
&ldquo;pan&rdquo; (post a note) by clicking on &ldquo;Try it!&rdquo;. There should also
to be a link on these pages, to make it easy to view source code
with your browser; but there isn't, so those pages without &ldquo;Try
it!&rdquo; links feel like dead ends.</p><p>I noticed glitches and unexpected results in some tour links;
for example, catcher and contool (listed among the XView example
programs) are not actually on the CD; their pages say that
copyright prevented inclusion and to use FTP to get a copy. The
catcher page has a clickable link for catcher.tar.Z from rain.com,
but the contool page merely says &ldquo;use archie or your favorite Net
Searching tool to find a copy.&rdquo; For psview, the tour futilely
refers to src/misc/psview instead of src/motif/psview. The workman
&ldquo;Try it out&rdquo; button is displayed by $$Try it out.$$. The TOUR
script determines it is running on a Linux system by detecting file
/vmLinux which didn't exist on my system; perhaps it should say
&ldquo;elif [ -f /vmLinux -o -f /vmlinuz ]&rdquo; instead of just &ldquo;elif [ -f
/vmLinux ]&rdquo;. Of course, minor problems like these are easily dealt
with by us Linux experts and need not deter anyone from buying the
CD.</p><p>The HOWTO document that refers to XView as &ldquo;the poor man's
object-oriented toolkit for building OPEN LOOK applications&rdquo; also
says &ldquo;Motif has become the standard user interface for X Window
System applications.&rdquo; I don't know enough about Motif or OPEN LOOK
to compare their technical qualities, but at a local bookstore saw
a dozen Motif titles in stock vs. two XView or OPEN LOOK titles.
This is consistent with Ian Darwin's comment (in article 14.03 of
the O'Reilly book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>X User Tools</em></span>, by Mui and
Quercia) that &ldquo;OPEN LOOK has essentially lost the commercial GUI
wars to Motif.&rdquo; But he concludes positively that &ldquo;olwm and the
XView toolkit will live forever, ensconced on tens of thousands of
CD-ROMS and on Linux and other ... distributions.&rdquo;</p></div></div>
