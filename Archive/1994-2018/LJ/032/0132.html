    IMEC/NIT is taking its Unix applications to its customers on
    a portable Linux box.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2783580.0x287b7c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Our research group at the InterUniversity
MicroElectronics Center (IMEC&mdash;more information about IMEC can be
found on
<a href="http://www.imec.be" target="_self">www.imec.be</a>)
in Leuven, Belgium is working on the simulation of microelectronic
fabrication processes and microelectronic devices. Somewhat
misleadingly, this is usually called Technology Computer Aided
Design (TCAD). Simulation is gaining importance in the
microelectronics industry as processes and devices are becoming
more complex. Real prototype fabrication currently takes too much
time and money in the development cycle for new technologies.
</p><p>However, producing a good
<a href="0132f1.html" target="_self">fabrication plan</a> for a new
semiconductor technology is difficult. Numerous parameters in the
plan, such as furnace temperatures, process duration, implant doses
of impurities and so on, influence the resulting semiconductor
microstructure. Also, the electrical characteristics of the diodes,
transistors and capacitors depend on the geometry and impurity of
the contents of the microstructure. The engineer is responsible for
coming up with a fabrication plan, such that all the electrical
characteristics of the devices not only meet their specified values
but also exhibit a minimal sensitivity towards the uncontrollable
fluctuations on the numerous process parameters. Trial and error
methods, combined with physical insight, were once the only tools
available for engineers.</p><p>In order to help the engineer on this laborious and grave
task, we developed a software package called
<a href="0132f2.html" target="_self">NORMAN/DEBORA</a>. Input to
<a href="0132f2.asc.html" target="_self">NORMAN/DEBORA</a> is a template
design for the fabrication plan, which contains a likely range for
some of its parameters. The package then fires off simulations of
some well-chosen fabrication plans and constructs mathematical
models for the electrical characteristics.</p><p>The engineer can then interpret the template fabrication plan
using these models. She will find the critical parameters and will
see how the electrical characteristics are linked, whether the
specified values are feasible and, of course, which parameter
values could be used to achieve this. The engineer can judge the
sensitivity of the electrical characteristics when parameter
variations occur, as in real fabrication. This will determine the
robustness of the fabrication plan. Finally, NORMAN/DEBORA can
perform an optimization of the fabrication plan, taking into
account specified electrical characteristics and parameter
sensitivity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2783580.0x287bb30"></a>From the Laboratory to the Marketplace</h2></div></div><p>Most engineering software currently runs on the more powerful
Unix systems of various breeds, and so does NORMAN/DEBORA. When the
product was leaving the research phase, demonstrations were held
for potential customers. At first, we envisaged the
microelectronics industry as the sole user. However, the general
concept of iterative simulations, plan evaluation and optimization
could also be applied to other fields of engineering, such as
injection molding of plastics and mechanical analysis of dynamics,
acoustics and vibrations.</p><p>Finding a place in the sun in the market for engineering
software proved to be tougher than we expected. We visited
customers, gave demonstrations and prepared successful examples on
the customers' particular types of engineering projects, using
their engineering software. For easy travelling, and to avoid
installation procedures, we decided to install the software on a
portable machine. Linux was the most attractive operating system,
because it installs on a small, inexpensive portable PC. Since
Linux itself is free, using it would be extremely cost-effective,
with no compromises in the required functionality.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux was hooked up to our network of Unix
workstations. In order to do this, we needed the PCMCIA driver
package in addition to the common distributions. Currently, we are
using FTP for transferring the source code, and remote login for
working on the machine. To integrate the machine even further, nfs
could be used, but it would require reconfiguration when the
portable is not connected.</p></li><li><p>We can run the simulators from our portable machine
using the remote execution facility of NORMAN/DEBORA. However, most
companies don't allow us to connect our portable to their
network.</p></li><li><p>For porting, Linux has a POSIX-compliant
programming interface and a good compiler for the C language
readily available. As some older and mathematical modules were
written in FORTRAN, we needed f2c to complete the porting since
there was no full compiler for FORTRAN available at that
time.</p></li><li><p>Porting our graphical user interface required an X
server for our graphical hardware, which needed to be selected with
care. As the user interface had been developed with Tcl/Tk, this
step also went smoothly. We are using gnuplot to generate graphs
and pbmtoxbm from the netpbm graphics format conversion library to
display these as X bitmaps. As some companies don't want to have
free software installed on their machines, we intend to replace
this graphical interface, using widgets from the Motif library,
which is available for Linux at a low price.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2783580.0x287bfa8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>The time spent in configuring Linux on a portable and porting
our software to it has certainly proven worthwhile. The machine has
been used to give demonstrations at customers' sites with great
ease, including two tours in the US and Canada. We are also working
on engineering projects at customer sites and using the machine for
a three day training course, held at the customer's site Our group
members regularly take the machine home for the weekend when it's
not being used by anyone else! Some of our customers are: Philips
in the Netherlands, OKI in Japan, Kodak and Xerox in the US.
Outside the field of microelectronic General Motors in the US is
also using NORMAN/DEBORA.</p><p>The marketing and further commercial development of the
package is handled by Numerical Integration Technologies (NIT), the
leading company in the field of software for acoustic
engineering.</p><p>As it hardly does any marketing itself, Linux usually enters
a commercial organization through its supporters. A lot of them are
software engineers, and they can have a hard time convincing their
managers Linux is a viable and even superior solution. Therefore we
want to thank the many programmers who have been developing the
system and its application software. We intend to continue porting
our software to the system at NIT.</p></div></div>
