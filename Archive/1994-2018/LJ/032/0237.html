likely read a similar note in the September issue. I can only
assume someone made <i  >LJ</i>'s five-day Editor an
offer he couldn't refuse.
</p><p>Similarly, I didn't see how I could say no when Phil Hughes,
our Publisher, asked if I'd like to leave my ho-hum job at a state
university and become Editor of a publication dedicated to
nurturing and promoting the use of Linux. The little operating
system that could is now a formidable force, and new product
announcements are becoming the rule rather than the exception. The
good press Linux is receiving in major media is exciting and
impressive. And who would've thought Linux would do so well that
the Santa Cruz Operation would start giving their Unix away?</p><p>Linux is still free and open, unlike the other Unix-like
operating systems. The ability for users to contribute to the
development of Linux creates a positive and vibrant scene. Because
Linux actually works&mdash;and works well&mdash;it is truly useful instead of
just fun.</p><p>Talented people devoting their time to Linux development make
it possible for others at many levels of computing savvy to use
Linux systems effectively. In many situations, users can just
&ldquo;plug and play&rdquo; now; Linux is no longer just for hackers. Of
course, Linux still has the free tools and open design to
accommodate anyone who <span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> want to start
playing around with code.</p><p>So, I had to take this job, really.</p><p>I've actually been working with Specialized Systems
Consultants, the company that publishes <i  >Linux Journal</i>, for a couple of years now. I decided I needed
to learn about this Linux thing I kept hearing about, joined a
mailing list, found out <i  >Linux Journal</i> needed
some data entry done in the evening... moved on to copy editing,
and now here I am.</p><p>My computing experience includes: playing with a Cyber on an
old TI thermal printing terminal with a 300-baud acoustic coupler,
calling up every BBS I could find back in the early '80s, trying to
load programs on cassette tape for my TRS-80 Model 1, learning
Turbo Pascal and CP/M (a functional OS in under 7K!) on a Kaypro
II, taking computer science classes with VMS on old Heath 19
terminals, spending countless hours with Macs and Windoze machines,
and, lately, trying everything I can find on my Linux machines. I
may have a talent for programming, but I've put more energy into
writing and editing, so I need to rely on the people actually
making things happen on Linux systems&mdash;programmers and
developers&mdash;for content. For you, the reader, this means
well-written articles by people who know what they're talking
about.</p><p>What I and the rest of the staff of <i  >Linux Journal</i> want is simple: world domination. Short of that,
we want to be the best source of information about Linux and to
help promote its use. We think we can do that with how-to texts,
programming tips, hardware and software reviews, examples of Linux
in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, and articles for the beginner. Is there
something you need or want to see? Please let me know
