The
Readers' Choice awards results are in, and who's your favorite
<i  >Linux Journal</i> columnist? Marcel Gagn&eacute;,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>bien s&ucirc;r</em></span>--the virtual French chef who
takes you on explorations of fascinating Linux software (and a
little <span   class="emphasis"><em>vin rouge</em></span>) every month. Marcel,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>nous vous aimons.</em></span> Check out your other
favorites on page 72.
</p><p>Even though our journal is (mostly) in English, we see that
Linux development for users who speak other languages is just as
popular around the world as Marcel's <span   class="emphasis"><em>cuisine</em></span>
is in our pages. In some areas, we English speakers need to catch
up.</p><p>In our September 2002 issue, Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall mentioned
the SAGU Project for university administrative software,
headquartered at the public university UNIVATES in the state of Rio
Grande do Sul in Brazil. At Linux Istanbul, a conference held as
part of the Bilism 2002 computer tradeshow in Istanbul in
September, Cesar Brod, who works on SAGU and, among other things,
on the GNUTECA free library software, said that the project has
already exceeded its goals financially. By developing a homegrown
solution, UNIVATES saved $130,000 US on software licenses up front.
And the annual $70,000 that would have gone to software upgrades
and maintenance is more than enough to pay the development team.
The university comes out ahead even before they release any free
software at all&mdash;contributions from outside, educational value and
the benefit of having a custom solution are purely bonuses.
UNIVATES actually added free software development to its
institution-wide mission statement.</p><p>For how many places on earth do shrink-wrap software
economics make sense anymore? Also in Istanbul, maddog brought up
the economic multiplier effect. Develop locally, whether on your
own or as part of a global project, and developers spend money
locally. Send the money away, and you'll never see it again.</p><p>Look for SAGU, GNUTECA and the other projects hosted on the
SourceForge descendant
<a href="http://codigolivre.org.br" target="_self">codigolivre.org.br</a>,
and you'll find a lot of cool software. The original web screens
and docs are all in Portuguese. However, SAGU is in the process of
being internationalized: &ldquo;A Japanese guy who lives in Sweden is
doing an English version for schools in South Africa&rdquo;, Cesar said
at the Istanbul event.</p><p>There is plenty of information on how to make your software
work in different languages in this issue. Check out &ldquo;Introduction
to Internationalization Programming&rdquo; (page 52) for how to do
things the standard, GNU, way. And, &ldquo;Indian Language Solutions for
GNU/Linux&rdquo; (page 46) covers the status of support for the widely
spoken but under-supported languages of that area.</p><p>We hear that the skeletal creature on the cover is cute with
his hide on, but you'll have to wait for the next movie from Jim
Henson's Creature Shop to find out. Meanwhile, learn how Linux can
drive their creatures on page 28.</p><p>As you might already have heard, I am the new editor in chief
