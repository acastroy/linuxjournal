    Vagueness, inapplicability and measures that fall short&mdash;why

to join her in requesting that the National Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) reverse their 1999 decision to adopt
UCITA, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.
</p><p>I've commented before on UCITA [see <i  >LJ</i>,
June 2002]. Readers of this column will recall that UCITA is a
model code intended to be adopted by all states, so there is
uniformity within software licensing law. UCITA provides default
rules that apply when a software license omits essential terms.
Another purpose of UCITA is to define what license terms are
against public policy and thus cannot be enforced, even if they are
included in a license.</p><p>On behalf of the Open Source Initiative, I wrote to the
NCCUSL to oppose UCITA. I did so because UCITA does not address yet
many of the major concerns of licensors and licensees of
open-source software. Even though recent amendments to UCITA have
begun to recognize our unique issues, the proposed law remains
flawed, incomplete, confusing and biased toward licensors of
proprietary software.</p><p>The drafters of UCITA have proposed several amendments to
address our issues, but they still struck out with us. Here's what
they proposed and why we continue to oppose it.</p><p>One recent amendment provides that &ldquo;a copyright notice
merely giving permission to use the software that is not part of a
contract is not within UCITA.&rdquo; This either is a truism (federal
copyright law preempts state contract law anyway) or is
inapplicable to the many open-source licenses intended to be
contracts. I understand that this amendment purports to address the
concerns of people using the GNU General Public License (GPL), a
license whose author urges that it be treated exclusively as a
copyright license. What about all the other licenses that satisfy
the Open Source Definition
(<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php" target="_self">www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php</a>)
and whose authors intend to form a contract? This provision is of
no help; it simply does not matter.</p><p>Another amendment excuses licensors from implied warranty
obligations &ldquo;if the software is free (no intent for profit or
commercial gain from the transfer of the copy or from controlling
use or distribution of the copy).&rdquo; This amendment relies on a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>commercial</em></span> definition of &ldquo;free&rdquo; as &ldquo;free of
charge&rdquo; rather than the far more important conveyance of rights to
use, copy, modify and distribute software, along with access to the
source code that makes those rights meaningful.</p><p>The latter concept of freedom underlies the principles of the
Free Software Foundation
(<a href="http://www.fsf.org" target="_self">www.fsf.org</a>) and the Open
Source Initiative
(<a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_self">www.opensource.org</a>),
but it apparently plays no role in UCITA. The actual language in
the UCITA provision is vague and confusing, relying as it does on
phrases like &ldquo;intends to make a profit&rdquo; and &ldquo;acts generally for
commercial gain&rdquo;. It will allow proprietary software vendors who
hide their source code and limit the rights to copy, modify and
distribute software to obtain the benefit of warranty exemptions,
even though they actively obstruct their customers' ability to make
the software &ldquo;merchantable&rdquo; and &ldquo;fit for a particular purpose&rdquo;
by doing so.</p><p>A third amendment says reverse engineering for the purpose of
interoperability cannot be prohibited by a license. This is an
important step&mdash;albeit a baby step&mdash;toward affirming the fair use
rights so badly damaged by the passage of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act. Unfortunately, because of federal preemption this
provision is probably of limited effect. Furthermore, this idea is
not the same as a strong statement by NCCUSL that a license
provision that restricts or limits <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> fair
use rights to software is unconscionable and against public policy.
Such a broad provision would not solve the preemption problem, but
it would make a valuable statement that may encourage Congress to
restore the public benefit objectives that underlie copyrights and
patents in the US Constitution. I am afraid that the current weak
and limited UCITA amendment relating to reverse engineering will
lull people into thinking that their former rights have been
restored.</p><p>I believe that it will be important to start afresh with
UCITA and consider the new environment in which open-source
software competes against proprietary, closed software marketed by
wealthy companies. UCITA is not particularly helpful to guide
courts in interpreting or enforcing open-source licenses or to
guide Congress in restoring fair use rights to the public. Without
that, the Open Source community doesn't need UCITA.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
attorney-client relationship specifically with reference to all the
facts of a particular situation and the law of your jurisdiction.
Even though an attorney wrote this article, the information in this
article must not be relied upon as a substitute for obtaining
specific legal advice from a licensed attorney.</p></div></div>
