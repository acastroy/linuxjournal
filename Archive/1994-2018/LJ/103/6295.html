    Some simple and cost-conscious ways to migrate workstations
    to the Linux desktop.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdf7580.0xeef4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, the restaurant looks
wonderful tonight. Do have another look around, and make sure that
each workstation has the necessary tools. I want this to be
perfect.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Bonsoir, mes amis</em></span>, and welcome to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of fine Linux cooking and
marvelous wine. Please sit down and be comfortable.
Fran&ccedil;ois, run along and fetch the wine.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>! Better make it the 1999
Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape.</p><p>Those of you who have been visiting my restaurant for some
time no doubt will take pleasure in the fact that many companies
(and individuals) are looking for alternatives to their desktop
operating system. Linux is the natural choice and offers many
relatively painless ways to make that switch. Unfortunately, modern
Linux distributions running KDE and GNOME can demand a great deal
of system resources, and many companies looking to make a switch
have modest PC hardware. Luckily, Linux makes it possible to set up
workstations with minimal Linux installations that offload most of
the work to a powerful, central server.</p><p>This type of setup is the thin-client design. Exactly how
thin this client can be depends on which approach you choose. As
you would expect with all fine ingredients, there are many ways to
prepare something. Fresh lobster steamed and served with drawn
butter and garlic is certainly excellent, but it is not the only
way. The same holds true for what we prepare in our Linux kitchens,
in this case thin-client implementations. In fact, one approach
lets you set up Linux workstations without re-installing the client
PC.</p><p>Probably the easiest way to achieve our thin-client goal is
to run a Linux workstation with an X server and not much else.
Rather than starting up KDE or GNOME, you can use OpenSSH:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
startx /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm
</pre><p>The resulting desktop is far from interesting. You get a
plain old X desktop with nothing but an X terminal running and no
window control whatsoever. What can you possibly do with this? For
one thing, you can connect to your server using OpenSSH, like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -C -X -l <span   class="emphasis"><em>user_name</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>server_name</em></span>
</pre>


The -C option sets up data compression in the secure stream, while
the -X enables the forwarding of X requests. Once you find yourself
at the command prompt, you can launch a desktop session on the
remote host by typing <b  >startkde</b> or
<b  >wmaker</b> or whichever desktop you prefer.
Suddenly, you will find yourself running a full graphical desktop
session on the remote server.
</p><p>Note that the server's /etc/ssh/sshd_config file must have
X11 forwarding turned on before the client request can be accepted.
Here is what the parameter in that file should look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
X11Forwarding yes
</pre><p>If you needed to change the parameter, you also will need to
restart sshd with <b  >service sshd restart</b>. This
kind of a remote desktop setup works wonderfully and can be quite
useful even if you already run a graphical Linux desktop. It is
particularly useful if having access to a desktop on the server
would otherwise require you to go to the computer room, which
happens to be across the building.
</p><p>If you want to run your own desktop <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
one on the server, switch to one of your virtual consoles by
pressing Ctrl-Alt-F2 (or F3 or F4...) and start a second X session
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
startx /usr/X11R6/bin/xterm -- :1
</pre><p>The -- :1 option (note the double hyphen) brings up a second
graphical desktop&mdash;yet another boring xterm on a boring background.
From here, you can use <b  >ssh</b> to connect to your
server and start whatever desktop session you like. To switch back
to your regular session, press Ctrl-Alt-F7 or Ctrl-Alt-F8 for the
second session. The downsides of this setup are that this isn't
exactly <span   class="emphasis"><em>thin</em></span> and, even with compression, the
OpenSSH stream can seem a bit slow.
</p><p>The best way to do an X display session (and to thin down the
client) is to use XDMCP, the X Display Manager Control Protocol.
From the Linux command line on the client PC, you would simply
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
X -query <span   class="emphasis"><em>server_name</em></span>
</pre><p>Magically, you would have a graphical login screen exactly as
it is running on your server. Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, as
you might expect, a little preparation must go into this recipe
before we can execute that simple command, but the preparation is
simple. While Fran&ccedil;ois refills your glasses, I will explain.
</p><p>In order to get a graphical login screen presented to a
querying host, the /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess file needs to have the
following lines uncommented:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*                        #any host can get
                             #a login window
*     CHOOSER BROADCAST  #any indirect host
                         #can get a chooser
</pre><p>You also need to have xdm running (or kdm or gdm), which
means your server comes up in runlevel 5. Those of you who boot up
into a graphical login screen probably can skim the next few lines.
To start services in runlevel 5, you must set the initdefault in
your /etc/inittab file to 5:
<pre     class="programlisting">
id:5:initdefault:
</pre>


If you aren't booting up into a graphical desktop, the 5 above
should be a 3. One last thing needs to be set in that /etc/inittab
file. Look down at the bottom, and you should see something like
this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Run xdm in runlevel 5
# xdm is now a separate service
x:5:respawn:/etc/X11/prefdm -nodaemon
</pre>


Log out and restart your X server so that the new changes take
effect. Then, from the workstation, simply run <b  >X -query
<i><tt>ip_address</tt></i></b> (the IP address of
your server, of course). If you are running XDM, things should
work. But, many of you will be using KDE's KDM login manager, and
you may find yourself looking at a flat gray screen with an X in
the center (although you can move that X around, it isn't very
interesting). That's because XDMCP access to KDM requires a little
bit more tweaking.
</p><p>KDE uses a kdmrc file. On my system, it is located in
/etc/kde/kdm. Look for the following lines and make sure that the
Enable parameter in the [Xdmcp] section is set to true:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[Xdmcp]
# Whether KDM should listen to XDMCP requests.
Enable=true
</pre><p>As Fran&ccedil;ois brings out the double-butter Brie to go
with your wine, let me tell you about the thinnest clients of all,
diskless workstations. Several options are available for this
approach; I will concentrate on one for today. However, given how
important a tool this is for Linux desktop deployment in the
workplace, I feel it is my duty as proprietor, in this home of fine
Linux fare, to point out a handful of other projects worthy of your
consideration. I will share some of these with you before closing
time, but for now, let's talk about booting these workstations.
</p><p>Boot diskettes, with the appropriate driver for your Ethernet
card, can be created using the tools from the Etherboot web site,
<a href="http://etherboot.sourceforge.net" target="_self">etherboot.sourceforge.net</a>.
Building from source is simply a matter of untarring the
distribution, changing to the src and typing
<b  >make</b>. There is an even easier way to do this,
however, thanks to the folks at ROM-o-matic.net
(<a href="http://rom-o-matic.net" target="_self">rom-o-matic.net</a>). They
maintain a collection of boot ROMs generated from the Etherboot
Project. Simply select the release level (latest is usually best),
the card type (3c509, tulip, etc.) and click Get ROM. The
downloaded file then can be transferred to a diskette:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat eb-5.0.6-yournic.lzdsk &gt; /dev/fd0
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Et voil&agrave;</em></span>! Our diskette is done.
Pop it into the workstation PC and reboot. When the system comes up
off the card, it will pause for a few seconds by default, giving
you the opportunity for a local or network boot&mdash;network is the
default. The problem is, your client has nothing to connect to
after it boots. This is where the Linux Terminal Server Project at
<a href="http://www.ltsp.org" target="_self">www.ltsp.org</a> comes into
play. The whole point of the project is to make the setup and
operation of thin-client Linux as simple as possible,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?
</p><p>All right, let's put that workstation out of our minds for a
few minutes and concentrate on the server. You will need a couple
of additional things, starting with a DHCP server (the dhcp package
from your Linux distribution) and a TFTP server (most likely, the
tftp-server in your distribution). You'll also need to install the
packages for your NFS server. Any major distribution will have
these on the CD(s), so you won't need to look far for them.</p><p>In the case of TFTP, you will find yourself with an entry in
/etc/xinetd.d for the service. Unfortunately, although the package
install will create an entry, it also will be disabled by default.
So, make sure the service (/etc/xinetd.d/tftp) has this
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
disable = no
</pre><p>Then, restart xinetd to activate the TFTP d&aelig;mon.
</p><p>If you haven't already done so, now would be a good time to
get the LTSP packages themselves. The site does offer tarred and
gzipped packages for everything, but it also provides precompiled
RPM packages for Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake and others. Debian users
also will find prepackaged DEBs available. If you choose to work
from the tarred bundles, simply extract them and run the install.sh
script in each package. Speaking of packages, these are the ones
you will need&mdash;I'm listing RPMs here, but the packages are in the
order you need them: ltsp_core, ltsp_kernel, ltsp_x_core and
ltsp_x_fonts. There are a few additional local application
packages, such as Netscape, but we will leave them for now.</p><p>This is the spot where things got a bit interesting on my
setup. I installed LTSP on three different machines and found that
their order was quite important. I needed to have dhcpd running for
the LTSP configuration step, but starting the d&aelig;mon required
that I have a valid /etc/dhcpd.conf file in place. Because I didn't
have such a setup, the autoconfig was failing so I decided to
create my own dhcpd.conf file; it isn't difficult. Have a look at
the following configuration. It should be sufficient to get you
going, keeping in mind, of course, that the IP address of my domain
(and my root-path server IP) certainly will be different from
yours:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
subnet 192.168.22.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
    option domain-name "yourdomain.dom";
    option root-path "192.168.22.10:/opt/ltsp/i386";
    range dynamic-bootp 192.168.22.128 192.168.22.254;
    default-lease-time 21600;
    max-lease-time 43200;
    }
host baroque {
    filename "/lts/vmlinuz-2.4.18-ltsp-1";
    hardware ethernet 00:50:FX:5B:XX:56;
    fixed-address 192.168.22.5;
            option host-name "baroque";
    }
</pre><p>Note that I have created at least one host. The filename is
correct for the latest LTSP distribution, but the hardware or MAC
address for the Ethernet card (besides being fictional here) must
be a valid one for your client. Start dhcpd with the command
<b  >service dhcpd start</b>.
</p><p>Once you've installed your DEBs, RPMs or tarred packages and
started the various services, you can thank the folks at LTSP
because the other work pretty much has been done for you. All you
need to do is execute an initialization script, which is
provided:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /opt/ltsp/templates
./ltsp_initialize
</pre><p>After you type the command, you will be warned that the
script is about to update some important system files, specifically
/etc/dhcpd.conf, /etc/exports and a few others (Figure 1).
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6295f1.large.jpg"><img src="6295f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Configuring Your LTSP Distribution
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Since NFS has been updated with new exports and DHCP
configuration information has been changed, you should restart the
NFS d&aelig;mon as well as the DHCP d&aelig;mon:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
service nfs restart
service dhcpd restart
</pre><p>We are almost done, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. In
seconds, we will have a top-of-the-line, yet modest, Linux
thin-client installation. Because all the software for LTSP is in
the /opt/ltsp, we need to make a little side trip there for some
configuration. Start by editing the file
/opt/ltsp/i386/etc/lts.conf. Specifically, look for this line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
SERVER = 192.168.22.10
</pre>


Make sure that it reflects the IP address of the host you are using
as your server. This lts.conf file is a good one to get to know. It
allows you to tweak individual workstation configurations on the
off chance that the defaults don't work for a particular one.
Here's a configuration I created for my workstation called baroque
(it needed to be configured with an old serial mouse):
<pre     class="programlisting">
[baroque]
       XSERVER            = vesa
       X_MOUSE_PROTOCOL   = "Microsoft"
       X_MOUSE_DEVICE     = "/dev/ttyS0"
       X_MOUSE_BUTTONS    = 3
       LOCAL_APPS         = N
       SWAPFILE_SIZE      = 64m
       RUNLEVEL           = 5
</pre>


Remember, as you add workstations (and bring more on-line), you
need to put these in the /etc/dhcpd.conf file. Yes, you do need to
restart the dhcpd service when you make changes, but that is all.
</p><p>Now that we have that out of the way, put in your diskette,
boot up your workstation, and in a few seconds, you should see your
kernel image being downloaded to the workstation via TFTP. A
configuration boot-time dialog will scroll past, followed by an
automatic X configuration. Incidentally, if X is giving you a hard
time at this stage of the game, you can change the workstation's
entry in the lts.conf file to runlevel 3 instead. You'll then boot
up into a text-only screen.</p><p>Closing time is fast approaching, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, but I did say I would tell you about similar
projects. You may want to look at Solucorp's X terminal toolkit
(<a href="http://www.solucorp.qc.ca" target="_self">www.solucorp.qc.ca</a>),
headed up by Jacques G&eacute;linas of Linuxconf fame. You also
might pay a visit to Diego Torres Milano's site at
<a href="http://pxes.sourceforge.net" target="_self">pxes.sourceforge.net</a>
and have a look at his PXES Linux thin-client package.</p><p>Thank you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, for sharing this
evening here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. I do hope that
your experience in thinner Linux has been a good one and that you
will consider it in your place of business. The cost benefits along
with simplified administration make it a perfect choice in this
cost-conscious world. Update the server, and you update everyone;
back up the server, and you've backed up every workstation&mdash;it
doesn't get any easier than that. Fran&ccedil;ois, please refill
our guests' wineglasses a final time. Until next month. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A
