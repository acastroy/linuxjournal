    Using Squid's URL redirection to implement WWW usage quotas.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2184580.0x227c3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The University of Zululand is a
&ldquo;historically disadvantaged&rdquo; university campus with approximately
6,000 students located in the northeastern coastal region of South
Africa. Our disadvantaged legacy continues in post-apartheid South
Africa, and our students are mostly black and are from financially
disadvantaged backgrounds. Consequently, our operating budgets are
severely constrained, and the daily challenge of doing more with
less prevails.
</p><p>In this environment, Linux is the obvious choice for our
internet services platform, and we use it for practically
everything: e-mail and WWW servers, DNS, DHCP, HTTP proxies,
firewalling and dial-up access. Our management loves the
&ldquo;free-as-in-beer&rdquo; aspect of Linux. However, our main reason for
using Linux is more compelling&mdash;using Linux is the most fun way to
deliver our internet services.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2184580.0x227c500"></a>Cost of Internet Access</h2></div></div><p>Early in 2000, our biggest financial challenge was to provide
internet access to all our staff and students. The cost of internet
bandwidth in South Africa is much higher than in the US. Our
128Kbps access circuit was costing approximately $5,000 US per
month. This circuit already was saturated during the day by our 400
staff users, and we still needed to provide internet access to the
350 workstations in our heavily used student labs.</p><p>We needed more bandwidth, but our budget wouldn't cover
doubling or tripling our access bandwidth. Without monitoring or
placing controls on internet usage, management was uneasy about
committing to large increases in spending on internet access. They
were skeptical of paying large monthly bills when they didn't know
who was using the Internet or for what purpose.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2184580.0x227c660"></a>Quotas and Prepayment</h2></div></div><p>Our problem was really one of how to provide an acceptable
quality of service (QoS) for WWW browsing within our budgetary
constraints. With unregulated internet access, congestion of the
access circuit is the only factor limiting demand, which usually
leads to the poorest QoS that the core group of die-hard
downloaders can bear.</p><p>We needed to provide some type of &ldquo;cost&rdquo; for internet usage
in order to regulate demand. This system would educate our users
about the real costs of providing internet access at the
university. For students, this cost should be prepaid. The level of
bad tuition debt at disadvantaged universities in South Africa is a
significant problem, and we didn't want to add bills for internet
access to the debt collection problem. We needed a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>quota</em></span> system for internet usage.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6214f1.large.jpg"><img src="6214f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Implementing WWW Usage
Quotas</p></div></div>
</p><p>Our bandwidth constraints have since eased with the
introduction of a new network for higher education in 2001. We
upgraded our internet access to 768Kbps (384Kbps CIR for
international traffic), while maintaining our monthly costs at
roughly the same level. However, we remain convinced that our quota
system is still necessary for maintaining a reasonable QoS for our
users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2184580.0x227ca80"></a>Squid and URL Redirection</h2></div></div><p>We use NLANR's popular Squid HTTP caching proxy software to
provide WWW access for our users. Our firewall ensures that staff
and students must use our proxy servers to access the WWW, and we
configured the proxies to require login names and passwords for WWW
access. With this configuration, the access.log file generated by
Squid has a complete record of all WWW activity for all users.
Tallying WWW usage for a given user is straightforward with the
information in access.log.</p><p>Squid can use external URL redirector programs. When a URL
redirector is configured, every URL request to the proxy is sent to
the standard input of the URL redirector program, which responds by
either telling the proxy to fetch the requested URL or to redirect
the request to a different URL. This feature is used by content
filtering with programs like SquidGuard where the URL redirector
checks each URL request against a database of undesirable URL
patterns. Any request for an undesirable URL is redirected to a
page telling the user that she may not view the requested
URL.</p><p>We realised that a URL redirector also could be used to
enforce usage quotas. The URL redirector checks the user's quota,
and if it has been exceeded, it would redirect her to a page
telling her she was out of credit. While simple in principle, this
has to happen quickly or it impacts the overall performance of the
proxy server. In our implementation, the URL redirector usually
responds in two milliseconds when the URL request is
permitted.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2184580.0x227cc38"></a>QUORUM Server</h2></div></div><p>QUORUM (QUOta-based Resource Usage Manager) is a server that
provides a simple message API with two basic message types: tallies
(bill a particular account/session for an item) and queries (ask
the server if a given account/session is still in credit).</p><p>We use the QUORUM server to manage the tallies of all URLs
retrieved by the proxy as well as the current credit balances of
user accounts and also to track user sessions, which correspond to
periods of uninterrupted WWW usage by a user. The server keeps a
cache of all active account and session tallies and credit
balances. Updated items in these caches periodically are written to
a database. The server has a WWW interface for displaying account
balances, user sessions and other administrative and debugging
information.</p><p>An early version of the server was written in C, using
various CGI programs to provide the WWW interface. However, this
approach was abandoned when we discovered Java servlets. The QUORUM
server is written as a collection of Java servlets and JSPs, with
JDBC for the back-end database connectivity. We currently run it
under Caucho's Resin Servlet/JSP container. We use MySQL for the
back-end database with Resin's built-in JDBC classes for MySQL
access and database connection pooling.</p><p>Java servlets are a natural choice for implementing an
application like QUORUM. The server contains several persistent
shared data structures for user sessions, per-session tallies and
caches of account tallies and credit balances. Since servlets are
simply Java classes that are part of a container application that
implements a WWW server, it is simple to create these persistent
objects as part of the server, as well as background threads that
check for idle sessions and periodically flush changed data to the
accounting database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2184580.0x227ce48"></a>How It Works</h2></div></div><p>When a user requests a URL, her browser sends the URL request
to the Squid proxy. Squid then sends this URL request information
to the URL redirector. The URL redirector sends a querySsn message
to the QUORUM server to ask if the user has a current QUORUM
session and if the user's account is still in credit. If everything
is okay, then the URL redirector replies to Squid with a blank line
telling Squid to fetch the requested URL.</p><p>If the user does not have a current session, or the querySsn
response indicates that the user's account has no credit, the
browser is redirected to a JSP, ssnInfo.jsp, in the QUORUM server
that shows the user's current account usage and available credit
and asks her to start a QUORUM session by clicking on a link to
another JSP, beginSsn.jsp. If the user's account is in credit, this
JSP creates a QUORUM session for the user.</p><p>The URL redirector actually sends a redirect to a servlet
that sends another redirect to ssnInfo.jsp. The URL redirector
passes the user name and IP address of the user as a parameter in
the request to the servlet:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/QUORUM/servlet/Redirect?ssn_id=<span   class="emphasis"><em>uname@ipaddr</em></span>
</pre><p>The servlet saves the ssn_id in the HTTP session associated
with the client's browser. This lets all the other JSPs use an HTTP
session variable to retrieve the user's account and session
information.
</p><p>Usage accounting depends on the information in Squid's
access.log file. After a URL has been fetched by Squid, it appends
a line to the access.log file, containing the URL fetched, the size
of the object in bytes, the user ID of the requester and the IP
address of the workstation making the request. A Python script,
squidTallies.py, reads the tail of access.log and generates
tallySsnItem request messages to the QUORUM server. The QUORUM
server processes these tally messages and keeps running usage
tallies for user accounts and sessions, as well as credit balances
for all active user accounts.</p><p>Account balances, usage tallies and logs of user sessions are
written to a MySQL database. A background thread in the QUORUM
server periodically walks through the caches of session tallies,
account tallies and credit balances and flushes any changed data to
the database. This enables the server to keep reasonably up-to-date
information in the database without overwhelming the database with
multiple updates for every single URL fetched.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2184580.0x227d1b8"></a>The PostMsg Servlet</h2></div></div><p>QUORUM request messages are simple text messages terminated
by a newline. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ref000001 querySsn ssn_id=soren@1.2.3.4 ccode=11000
</pre><p>is a request message asking the server if the user soren at
IP address 1.2.3.4 has a current QUORUM session, and if the user is
still in credit for &ldquo;cost code&rdquo; 11000. The first field of all
request messages is a user reference that is echoed back to the
client in the response message, which allows multithreaded clients
to match responses to request messages.
</p><p>As a J2EE application, you might expect a hipper message
transport such as SOAP over HTTP. We considered encoding the
requests as individual HTTP GET requests to servlets that would
implement the various QUORUM API messages. This would have been a
cleaner fit with the servlet framework, but our tests indicated
that the HTTP overhead would be too large for our application. The
peak demand from our student labs is 20-30 URLs per second. Since
each URL request would correspond to two QUORUM request messages
(one querySsn request and one tallySsnItem request), the server
would need to handle 60 requests per second comfortably. We use a
single QUORUM server to handle both our staff and student proxies,
so we need to handle at least 100-150 requests per second. We could
not achieve these rates using a separate HTTP request for each
QUORUM request message, even making back-to-back requests over a
single persistent HTTP connection.</p><p>Instead, a single servlet, PostMsg, handles all QUORUM
request messages from clients. A client application makes an HTTP
POST request and then sends QUORUM request messages on the TCP
connection of the POST request, as if it was uploading a file or
other data in the request. The PostMsg servlet reads request
messages, one per line, from the ServletInputStream with the
readLine() method of the input stream. It processes the request
messages and sends responses back to the client on the
ServletOutputStream. After sending the response, it calls the
flushBuffer() method on the ServletHTTPResponse object to ensure
the response is sent to the client. Using this technique, a single
QUORUM server can handle several thousand requests per second on a
single client connection.</p><p>There are two minor problems with this technique. First, the
servlet container will close any HTTP connection that is idle for
more than a set time, typically 30 seconds or so. This means that a
client will be disconnected when it doesn't send any requests for a
while. The client will then have to reconnect and send another HTTP
POST request in order to send more QUORUM request messages. We
wrote a Python class that provides a UNIX pipe for sending requests
and reading responses. The class establishes the HTTP connection on
demand and sends the HTTP POST request. An advantage of the
connect-on-demand technique is that the message transport is very
robust&mdash;idle connections don't hang around and there aren't
problems with clients getting stuck, thinking they have a
connection that the server thinks is closed.</p><p>The other problem is that HTTP/1.1 requires that a POST
request has a Content-length header in both the request and the
response. While we found that Tomcat ignored this restriction,
Resin did not, and it closed the connection when the number of
bytes sent by either client or server exceeded the Content-length
value. Our workaround was to set a very large value in the
Content-length header and arrange for the client to close the
connection well before that number of bytes was sent.</p><p>Performance of the URL redirector is critical for the proxy
as each URL request is delayed until the URL redirector responds.
QUORUM's URL redirector keeps a cache of querySsn replies for all
recent sessions. This makes the redirector very fast for URL
requests once a session has been established and is in credit, as
the URL redirector responds based on the most recent reply message
in the cache. The response time in this case is typically two
milliseconds or less. Even if there is a cached reply, the
redirector always sends a querySsn request to the QUORUM server.
The reply message is used to update the reply cache, so the cache
always contains up-to-date information about the status of user
sessions and credit balances.</p><p>When the redirector doesn't have a cached reply message, or
if the cached reply is negative (user out of credit), then the
redirector sends a querySsn request and blocks the reply to the
proxy server until the response from the QUORUM server has been
received. In this case, the redirector may take from 20 to 50
milliseconds to respond.</p><p>Squid can be configured to start up several copies of the URL
redirector so that URL redirection requests can be processed in
parallel. The QUORUM URL redirector is multithreaded so that Squid
can make several simultaneous URL requests. Squid actually talks to
several copies of a small stub program that forwards the URL
redirector requests to the URL redirector process over unix-domain
socket connections. This allows the URL redirector to share the
same cache of querySsn replies for all the requests.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2184580.0x227d5d8"></a>Deployment and Administration</h2></div></div><p>Painless administration of user accounts is crucial to the
successful adoption of this system. In our deployment of QUORUM,
students must have a usage quota for WWW access. Staff usage is
currently tallied by the QUORUM server, but staff members are not
yet subject to quotas. (Tracking staff usage with QUORUM has been
invaluable in cracking down on the use of stolen staff accounts by
students, however.)</p><p>For internet usage related to a particular course, we credit
all students in the course with a specified amount of usage credit,
using our database of student registration information. We do this
at the start of every term for all courses where the lecturers have
requested internet access.</p><p>In the past, we found that there were continual cases of
students who had registered late, whose registration was not in our
database for some other reason or who simply needed additional
usage quota. We now have additional discretionary accounts for some
departments. Nominated lecturers can transfer funds from their
departmental accounts to individual student accounts. This relieves
our department of an administrative burden and gives the
departments some discretion for the management of student
accounts.</p><p>For students who require additional usage over and above the
quota they are issued, we will introduce a prepaid voucher system.
This system is intentionally reminiscent of the voucher systems for
prepaid cell phones, which are very popular with our students.
Students will be able to buy a voucher from the university bookshop
that has a secret access number. The voucher can be redeemed by
typing this number into a WWW form and submitting it. The MD5 hash
of the number entered is compared to hash values stored in a
database table, and if the hashed value matches one of these, the
student's account is credited with the amount shown on the voucher.
We have had initial discussions with the suppliers of our new
campus point-of-sale (PoS) system to see if we can sell our
internet quota vouchers using a system similar to the one currently
used to sell prepaid cell-phone vouchers at till points.</p><p>The voucher system is an important part of our goal to offer
a flexible internet service to our users, subsidize internet use
for academic purposes and recover the costs of other usage. We
currently are testing the voucher system. There is pressure from
the students to introduce the voucher system quickly, but we are
being very cautious about the rollout of the system as we this will
be a service that students are paying for directly. It is important
that the system is well established and well understood by our
student users so they can be completely comfortable with what they
are paying for.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2184580.0x227d840"></a>Future Directions</h2></div></div><p>From the outset, QUORUM was designed for applications beyond
WWW usage accounting and quota management. Any service that
generates a log file of usage information can be parsed by a script
that sends tally request messages to the QUORUM server. In the near
future, we will add accounting for e-mail usage so that mail
messages with large attachments are billed against the sender's
usage quota. Gratuitous e-mail usage (sending that cool AVI to all
your friends) has been a recurring problem at our site. In the
future, our users will have to decide if sending a large e-mail
attachment now might mean having to pay for WWW access
later.</p><p>Usage accounting in QUORUM is structured into cost codes.
Currently, WWW usage is broken down into international and national
traffic, which are charged at different rates, and Squid cache
hits, which are not charged for. The breakdown of charges is
hierarchical, where internet usage may be split into WWW and e-mail
access, each of which is split into further categories. Eventually,
we plan to have additional usage cost codes for network printing,
dial-up access and direct TCP/IP traffic through our firewall. The
hierarchical structure of the cost codes means that we can have one
quota for all services or that specific quota credits apply to only
parts of the cost-code hierarchy. For example, we could decide that
the quota credits issued to students in a course apply only to
internet access, but prepaid voucher credits could be used for
network printing as well.</p><p>We are trying to utilise our internet bandwidth more
effectively by encouraging our users to do so. Our charging
structure benefits users who download large files from mirror sites
within South Africa rather than from overseas. It is cheaper for us
to purchase guaranteed bandwidth for national destinations than for
overseas ones. Similarly, we offer after-hour discounts to
encourage users to download large files in the evenings when our
internet access is less congested.</p><p>Another intriguing idea is to integrate a messaging/bulletin
system into QUORUM, a sort of intranet instant messaging. We
currently can see which users are browsing the WWW. QUORUM could be
extended so messages could be sent to a user or group of users.
When one of the recipients next requests a URL, the QUORUM server
could redirect the user to a page that shows the
message/bulletin.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2184580.0x227da50"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>We have developed a flexible accounting and quota management
system that works with our existing Linux and OSS-based internet
services platform. This system will play an important role in
offering a well-managed internet service on our campus, both from
the control it offers over usage and the information it provides
about the demand for services.</p></div></div>
