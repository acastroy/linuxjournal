    Some of the world's most widely spoken languages are the
    hardest to support on a computer. Here's how support is
    coming together for Hindi, Malayalam and other languages of
    the Indian subcontinent.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dde580.0x1ed6660"></a></h2></div></div><p>South Asia, home to nearly one-sixth of
humanity, is struggling to attain regional language solutions that
would make computing accessible to everyone. Even if most are poor
and have low purchasing ability, this could open the floodgate to
greater computing power and much-needed efficiency in a critical
area of the globe. However, some call Indic and other South Asian
scripts the final challenge for full-i18n support.
</p><p>Some Indian regional languages are larger than those spoken
by whole countries elsewhere. Hindi, with 366 million speakers, is
second only to Mandarin Chinese. Telugu has 69 million; Marathi, 68
million; and Tamil, 66 million. Sixteen of the top 70 global
languages are Indian languages with more than 10 million speakers.
Other languages spoken in India are also spoken elsewhere. Bengali
has 207 million speakers in India and Bangladesh, and Urdu has 60
million in Pakistan and India.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dde580.0x1ed67c0"></a>Simputer Offers Text-to-Speech</h2></div></div><p>The Simputer is a simple and relatively inexpensive Linux
computer for people in Indian villages. The creation of the
Simputer is being organized with a hardware license, the Simputer
General Public License, modeled on the GPL. Although the license
provides for free publication of specifications, it does require a
one-time royalty payment before licensees sell Simputers.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6282f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The Simputer features a 200MHz StrongARM processor, 32MB of DRAM,
24MB of Flash storage, a monochrome display, speaker and
microphone.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>dhvani</b></span> is a text-to-speech
system for Indian languages developed by the Simputer Trust
developers and others. It is promising to have a better phonetic
engine, Java port and language-independent framework soon. (See
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dhvani" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/dhvani</a>.)
Meanwhile, IMLI is a browser created by the Simputer Trust for the
IML markup language. It is designed for easy creation of Indian
language content and is integrated with the text-to-speech
engine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dde580.0x1ed6b88"></a>I18n Frameworks Already in Place</h2></div></div><p>In Kerala, a southern state with an impressive 90% literacy
rate whose language Malayalam is spoken by 35 million people,
senior local government official Ajay Kumar
(<a href="mailto:kumarajay1111@yahoo.com">kumarajay1111@yahoo.com</a>)
is leading an initiative to make GNU/Linux Malayalam-friendly: &ldquo;We
propose to develop a renderer for our language. Specifically, we
are looking for a renderer for Pango (the generic engine used with
the GTK toolkit).&rdquo;</p><p>He adds, that in nine months time, &ldquo;we want to create an
atmosphere where language computing in Malayalam improves.&rdquo; He
also says, &ldquo;We are confident that once we deliver the basic
framework, others will start localizing more applications in
Malayalam.&rdquo;</p><p>At the toolkit level, GTK and Qt are the most used. GTK
already has a good framework through the Pango Project and has
basic support for Indian languages. Qt also now has Unicode support
for all languages, but rendering is not yet ready.</p><p>International efforts also are helping India. Yudit, the free
Unicode text editor, now offers support for three South Indian
languages: Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu. Delhi-based GNU/Linux
veteran Raj Mathur commented, &ldquo;The current version of Yudit has
complete support for Malayalam and other Indic languages. It can
also use OpenType layout tables of Malayalam fonts. I think Yudit
is the first application that can use OpenType tables for
Malayalam.&rdquo;</p><p>K Ratheesh was a student of the Indian Institute of
Technology-Madras (at the South Indian town of Chennai) when he
worked on enabling the GNU/Linux console for local languages a
couple years ago. He said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>As the [then] current PSF format didn't support
variable width fonts, I have made a patch in the console driver so
that it will load a user-defined multiglyph mapping table so that
multiple glyphs can be displayed for a single character code. All
editing operations also will be taken care of.</p></blockquote></div><p>In Indian languages, there are various consonant/vowel
modifiers that result in complex character clusters. &ldquo;So I have
extended the patch to load user-defined, context-sensitive parse
rules for glyphs and character codes as well. Again, all editing
operations will behave according to the parse rule
specifications&rdquo;, Ratheesh commented.
</p><p>Ratheesh also said, &ldquo;Even though the patch has been
developed keeping Indian languages in mind, I feel it will be
applicable to many other languages (such as Chinese) that require
wider fonts on console or user-defined parsing at I/O
level.&rdquo;</p><p>The package, containing the patch, some documentation,
utilities and sample files then weighed in at around 100KB.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dde580.0x1ed7000"></a>Which Languages First?</h2></div></div><p>Many issues need to be tackled in the search for solutions.
For instance, which languages need be tackled first? Joseph Koshy
(<a href="mailto:JKoshy@FreeBSD.ORG">JKoshy@FreeBSD.ORG</a>),
HP's Bangalore-based technical consultant, argues that the North
Indian Hindi family promises the greatest reach population-wise.
However, he feels the southern languages&mdash;Kannada, Telugu, Tamil
and Malayalam&mdash;offer the greatest promise of real-world
deployability. They enjoy a better support infrastructure needed to
deploy an effective IT solution, which appears to be better in
South India.</p><p>Outside of his work life at HP, Koshy is a volunteer
developer of the FreeBSD operating system and one of the founders
of the Indic-Computing Project on SourceForge. Koshy says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>What I am interested in is helping make
standards-based, interoperable computing for Indian languages a
reality. This dream is bigger than any one operating system or any
one computing platform. I want to see pagers, telephones, PDAs and
other devices that have not been invented yet interacting with our
people in our native languages.</p></blockquote></div><p>But others have different views. CV Radhakrishnan
(<a href="mailto:cvr@river-valley.org">cvr@river-valley.org</a>),
a TeX programmer who has contributed packages to the Comprehensive
TeX Archive Network and runs River Valley Technologies in South
India, says:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I think most of the South Indian languages could
pose problems [because of] their nonlinear nature. For example, to
create conjunct glyphs one has to go back and forth, while North
Indian languages do not have this problem. Malayalam has peculiar
characters called half consonants [&ldquo;chillu&rdquo;]. There is no
equivalent for this in other languages. This raises severe
computing/programming challenges.</p></blockquote></div>

Koshy notes that the official Census of India lists 114 &ldquo;major&rdquo;
languages in the subcontinent, and that linguists, who discriminate
more finely than the Census officials, peg the number of living
languages in India at 850 plus.
</p><p>According to Koshy, out of the 18 more important
&ldquo;scheduled&rdquo; national languages, all except the Devanagari-based
ones (which use the same script as Hindi) have serious issues when
it comes to representing and processing them on a computer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dde580.0x1ed7420"></a>Other OSes Lag</h2></div></div><p>Proprietary OSes have trouble with Indian language support
too, says Edward Cherlin
(<a href="mailto:edward@webforhumans.com">edward@webforhumans.com</a>)
who creates multilingual web sites: &ldquo;Progress is slow at Microsoft
and Apple. Linux should pass them by the end of the year, or early
in 2003.&rdquo;</p><p>On GNU/Linux, Cherlin points out, you can volunteer to
Indicize any application. In the future, when font management and
rendering are standardized, all applications will run in Indian
languages for input and output without further ado, and anyone will
be able to create a localization file to customize the user
interface. According to Cherlin, volunteers also are needed to
translate documentation.</p><p>Additionally, Cherlin says, &ldquo;Apple and Microsoft are not
willing simply to support typing, display and printing. They will
not release language and writing system support until they have
complete locales built, preferably including a dictionary and spell
checker.&rdquo; Linux is under no such constraints.</p><p>He points out that the Free Standards Group together with
Li18nux.org are proposing to rationalize and simplify i18n support
under X, including a common rendering engine, shared font paths and
other standards that will simplify greatly the business of
supporting all writing systems and all languages. Cherlin feels
that Yudit and Emacs both support several Indic scripts and could
be extended with only moderate effort on the part of a few
experts.</p><p>Microsoft's Windows XP has Indian language support based on
the current Unicode version (3.x) and hence suffers from all the
problems of Unicode-based solutions: inability to represent all the
characters of some Indian languages and awkwardness in text
processing.</p><p>&ldquo;When Microsoft came up with the South Asian edition of
MS-Word, the fonts had a lot of problems. Mostly, words were
rendered as separate letters with space in between and not combined
together as is the case with most Indian languages&rdquo;, says PicoPeta
language technology specialist Kalika Bali. PicoPeta is one of the
firms working to create the Simputer.</p><p>However, Dr UB Pavanaja
(<a href="mailto:pavanaja@vishvakannada.com">pavanaja@vishvakannada.com</a>),
a former scientist now widely noticed for his determined work to
push computing in the influential South Indian language of Kannada
(<a href="http://www.vishvakannada.com" target="_self">www.vishvakannada.com</a>),
sees the progress as being &ldquo;quite remarkable, compared with the
scene about two years ago&rdquo;. Pavanaja says, &ldquo;Current pricing and
product activation of [Windows] XP may become a boon for
GNU/Linux.&rdquo;</p><p>Mandrake Linux includes Bengali, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Hindi
Devanagari and Tamil out of the box. That leaves Oriya, Malayalam,
Telugu and Kannada yet to be done, along with the Indic-derived
Lao, Sinhala, Myanmar and Khmer. Tibetan and Thai are moderately
well supported, Cherlin contends.</p><p>&ldquo;Recently, localization efforts are picking up&rdquo;, agrees
Nagarajuna G, scientist/free software advocate in Mumbai. He also
notes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If the government or other funding agencies can
spare any amount to bodies like the Free Software Foundation of
India and others who are active in the localization initiative, the
developers could work with obsession and make this happen very
fast. FSFIndia is presently working with the Kerala government to
produce Malayalam support for the GNOME desktop.</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="6282s1.html" target="_self">Projects Finding an Indian Tongue

OpenType, Type 1, etc.) is capable of handling Indic scripts.
Availability of quality fonts is another matter, but as Koshy puts
it, this is not really a showstopper. Display technology for
embedded devices, such as pagers and other small devices, for
Indian languages is not well developed.</p><p>Languages like Urdu and Sindhi have right-to-left scripts
that look similar to Arabic but are, in fact, different, says
Prakash Advani who some years back launched the FreeOS.com
initiative. Urdu is the main language of Pakistan but is also used
in India.</p><p>Satish Babu
(<a href="mailto:sb@inapp.com">sb@inapp.com</a>), a free
software enthusiast and vice president of InApp, an Indo-US
software company dealing with free and open-source solutions,
points to other problems, such as collation (sorting) order
confusion (oftentimes, there is no unique &ldquo;natural&rdquo; collation
order, and one has to be adopted through standardization).</p><p>There's also the non-availability of dictionaries and
thesauri in Indian languages and issues arising out of multiple
correct spellings for words; encoding standardization (Unicode)
that will, inter alia, facilitate transliteration between Indian
languages programme support (database, spreadsheet) for
sorting/searching two-byte strings; lack of support of some
languages (e.g., Tulu, Konkani, Haryanvi and Bhojpuri), which are
the mother tongues for some sections of our population.</p><p>Ravikant
(<a href="mailto:ravikant@sarai.net">ravikant@sarai.net</a>),
who taught history at Delhi University before moving to the
Language and New Media Project of sarai.net
(<a href="http://www.sarai.net" target="_self">www.sarai.net</a>), says,
&ldquo;The long-term solution is of course Unicode.&rdquo; For short-term
measures, he suggests working toward developing the existing
packages &ldquo;in a manner that people can use them with freedom from
OSes and fonts&rdquo;. ITRANS and WRITE32, written by Indians settled
abroad, are transliteration packages that already do so. The
LaTeX-Devnag package is being used and promoted by Mahatma Gandhi
International University, Delhi.</p><p>Says Prakash Advani
(<a href="mailto:prakash@netcore.co.in">prakash@netcore.co.in</a>)
of the FreeOS.com initiative: &ldquo;There is definitely a market for
Indian language computing that exists today, but there is a huge
untapped market: 95% of the population doesn't read or write
English. If we can provide a low-cost Indian language computer, it
will be a killer.&rdquo;</p><p>Advani also says, &ldquo;The biggest challenge is not technical
but a lack of standards. Till Unicode happened, there was a
complete lack of standards. Everyone was following their own
standards of input, storage and output of data.&rdquo;</p><p>There is a lack of free Indian language fonts. &ldquo;There are
over 5,000 commercial Indian language fonts, but there are probably
ten Free (GPL/royalty free) Indian language fonts. This is a
serious issue, and more efforts should be made to release free
fonts&rdquo;, Advani adds.</p><p>Besides, others point out, fonts are another mess altogether.
Most of the current implementations rely on glyph locations to
display and store information. For instance, to represent the
letter &ldquo;a&rdquo;, what is stored is the position of &ldquo;a&rdquo; in some
particular font used by that package. This is different from normal
English where the ASCII standard specifies that to represent &ldquo;a&rdquo;
the number 65 must be used. No such standard exists for Indian
languages, and thus one document written in one application cannot
be opened in another. This is also the reason why authors of Indian
web pages must specify particular fonts.</p><p>Vendors use this situation to lock in their customers to a
particular product. This also limits the exchange of e-mail to only
situations where both parties have the same web interface or
program for using an Indian language e-mail.</p><p>TUGIndia, which Raj Mathur represents, has procured a
Malayalam font (Keli) from font designer Hashim. The font is
currently available at
<a href="http://www.linuxense.com/oss/keli.volt.zip" target="_self">www.linuxense.com/oss/keli.volt.zip</a>.
This is the OpenType source for the Malayalam font. You can edit
and improve the font tables with Microsoft VOLT. The font tables
are released under the GNU GPL, and the glyph shapes can be changed
provided that the fonts are redistributed under a different name.
Raj works as an engineer at Linuxense Information Systems and leads
the Indian TeX users' group's localization project.</p><p>G Karunakar, another young developer with a keen interest in
this field, says, &ldquo;There are very few people in India who
understand font technology completely, so most available fonts are
buggy. Due to a lack of font standard, our fonts are not tagged as
Indian language fonts.&rdquo;</p><p>Right now, a general consensus seems to be building on
OpenType fonts as the suitable technology for Indian language
fonts. There is already a free Devanagari font (&ldquo;Raghu&rdquo; by Dr RK
Joshi, NCST and used in Indix), a Kannada OpenType from KGP, also
for Malayalam, Telugu and Bengali.</p><p>The Indian TeX Users Group currently has a project to fund
font designers in all the Indian languages who are ready to write
fonts and release them under GPL. They've thus secured &ldquo;Keli&rdquo; a
Malayalam font family in various weights and shapes written by
Hashim and released under GPL. &ldquo;We do hope to get more fonts in
other languages to fill in the gaps. We hope to use the savings
generated with TUG2002 (which was held in India in September 2002)
exclusively for this purpose&rdquo;, says Radhakrishnan in
Thiruvananthapuram.</p><p>&ldquo;A lot of the know-how exists in rare books, which are
difficult to get. A lot of research work done by scholars,
linguists, typographers, etc., is going untapped, because we don't
know of it, or the people who know it,&rdquo; adds Karunakar.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dde580.0x22d0430"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>Shrinath
(<a href="mailto:shrinath@konark.ncst.ernet.in">shrinath@konark.ncst.ernet.in</a>),
a senior staff scientist at Mumbai's NCST, which has done some
interesting work on this subject, says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We want Indian language programming to be as
simple as programming in English is today. Almost every company has
to re-invent the wheel or buy costly solutions from others. In
English, the OS supports it. It's a chicken-and-egg problem. If
there are applications in Indic, OS vendors will build the
fundamental capabilities into the OS, and if the capabilities are
built in, there will be more applications.</p></blockquote></div><p>&ldquo;English has been the de facto language for software
development as well as usage. So there is a long way to go. China
is working quickly on that end, and so can we&rdquo;, argues Girish S,
an electronics engineer from the central Indian region of Madhya
Pradesh, who set up ApnaJabalpur.com.
</p><p>There are other needs too, such as dictionaries and spell
checkers. Word breaking doesn't operate the same way in Indic
scripts as in the Latin alphabet and neither does fine typography,
which you don't find in consumer or office applications in any
language. Finally, the main challenge is the sheer numbers. India
is believed to have 1,652 mother tongues, of which, 33 are spoken
by people numbering over a 100,000.</p><p>At the time of this writing, a number of key proponents of
Indianization are planning to meet in the southern city of
Bangalore at the end of September to discuss local language
development tools, applications and content. The meeting is planned
for 20-25 core participants.</p><p>&ldquo;We also hope that this broad coalition would play a
facilitatory role in helping local language groups interact more
effectively with international standards processes and forums, such
as the Unicode Consortium and W3C&rdquo;, says Tapan Parikh, one of the
organisers.</p><p>
