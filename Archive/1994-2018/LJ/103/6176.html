    Olexiy describes the basic aspects of i18n and provides a sample i18n output program.

used computers, they were, for the most part, English speakers.
Today, computers are widely available, and differences in
languages, traditions and cultures need to be reflected in the
world of programming. This article introduces the GNU gettext
system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ba0580.0x1c98500"></a>Internationalization and Localization</h2></div></div><p>The idea of using the same program but changing its
properties according to the cultural traditions of different
peoples is called <span   class="emphasis"><em>internationalization</em></span>.
However, because programmers like to make words shorter, instead of
typing 20 characters they type only four:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>i18n</em></span>. I18n means programming designed to
handle many languages.</p><p>Once you've written an i18n program, you may want to add a
new language. This is not an i18n problem. In general, you need a
person who will translate messages from the program for a specific
nation. This problem is called <span   class="emphasis"><em>localization</em></span>,
or <span   class="emphasis"><em>i10n</em></span>. I10n refers to the implementation of
a specific language for an internationalized software, or in other
words, the creation of <span   class="emphasis"><em>localized objects</em></span>
according to the specific region's rules.</p><p>Although each organization and company that designs and
distributes software tries to implement this in its own way, in
general, the i18n idea is simple. Software should be created with
two parts in mind: common and nation-dependent. This second part is
known as <span   class="emphasis"><em>localized objects</em></span>.</p><p>Hopefully, standards will make life more comfortable. The
basic concept of <span   class="emphasis"><em>locale</em></span> was introduced by the
ISO (International Standard Organization) with the C standard in
1990, which was expanded in 1995. POSIX also has rules for i18n, so
the term <span   class="emphasis"><em>POSIX locale</em></span> is used together with
National Language Support (NLS). Formally, NLS is not a part of
POSIX but has some functions that help when using the POSIX locale.
X11 has its own i18n implementation, but the common way for
programmers is to move the X11 i18n/i10n &ldquo;up a level&rdquo; into the
POSIX/NLS locale. [Other software has its own i18n and i10n. See
&ldquo;Bridging the Digital Divide in South Africa&rdquo; for one way to handle
it].</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ba0580.0x1c989d0"></a>Language, Coding and Charsets</h2></div></div><p>What should we take into account when speaking of locale? Of
course, the name of the language, but that is not enough. Everybody
knows there are differences between American and British English,
so we also have to know <span   class="emphasis"><em>where</em></span> the particular
language is used, or in other words, the territory, taking into
account individual traditions and cultural rules.</p><p>Every language has its own system of writing, and sometimes
even several. Languages have alphabets, or character repertoires,
but computers deal with digits. So, a character should be
associated with a digit. This kind of association is called a coded
character set (CCS). There are plenty of them, and each has its own
name, such as ASCII, ISO-8859-1, KOI8-U. Instead of CCS, the term
charset is often used. There is no special standard for the name of
a charset, so ISO-8859-1, ISO8859-1 and iso8859-1 all refer to the
same thing. There are some definitions from IANA, the organization
that also is responsible for the registration of charsets (see
Resources). As you probably know, the X11 system has its own system
for charset naming, and their document &ldquo;Logical Font Description
Conversion&rdquo; (described in Jim Flower's article, see Resources)
provides a good name and alias charset creating system.</p><p>Charsets are important. Some countries have several different
charsets for the same language! In the Ukraine, for instance, the
same text may be displayed nicely in koi8-u but may be absolutely
unreadable if a terminal uses the Ukrainian charsets iso8859-5,
cp1251 or Unicode. In those cases, we would have to convert the
text from one charset into another.</p><p>In order to take all of this into account, the POSIX locale
defines some things that all together are called <span   class="emphasis"><em>locale
categories</em></span>. They are shown in Table 1. Knowing them is
important; C functions work differently with different locales!
Categories are reflected in shell as environment variables with the
same name. An example of using LC_ALL is shown in Listing 1.</p><p><a href="6176l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Example of Using
LC_ALL</a></p><p>The syntax to build a locale name looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>language</em></span>[<span   class="emphasis"><em>_territory</em></span>][.codeset][@<span   class="emphasis"><em>modifier</em></span>]
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>language</em></span> is represented by two
lowercase letters, such as <b  >en</b> for English and
<b  >fr</b> for French; <span   class="emphasis"><em>territory</em></span> is
represented by two uppercase letters, such as <b  >GB</b>
for United Kingdom and <b  >FR</b> for France, and in
these two cases, <b  >euro</b> would be the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>modifier</em></span>. So, you can change your locale by
setting the corresponding environment variables. See Listing 1,
where we use the programs <span   class="bold"><b>date</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> and our example program,
<span   class="bold"><b>counter</b></span>. Note, we use only
language and territory; we cannot change the charset for the
terminal with this command. Now imagine that the program messages
are written in one charset but are output in another. POSIX does
not have functions to determine the current charset, but XPG has
nl_langinfo(). In some distributions, the man page for this
function may be missing (Debian does not have it, but SuSE and Red
Hat do). In any case, you can obtain additional information from
/usr/include/langinfo.h. To determine the current charset, use the
following code:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;locale.h&gt;
#include &lt;langinfo.h&gt;
 ...
 setlocale(LC_ALL,"");
 printf ("Current charset = %s\n",
            nl_langinfo(CODESET));
</pre>


To convert from one coding into another for the correct output, you
can use the conv() function. For more details, consult
&ldquo;Introduction to i18n&rdquo; (see Resources).
</p><p>In order to provide output information, a message catalog for
that locale was created. This means that all software messages are
kept separately from a program that may have (and must have) its
own catalog. NLS provides a set of utilities for creating and
supporting such catalogs, as well as functions for extracting
information according to three keys: 1) program name, 2) current
categories of locale and 3) pointer to a particular message to be
output.</p><p>There are two general realisations of the NLS
mechanism:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>X/Open Portability Guide
XPG3/XPG4/XPG5</b></span> with the functions catopen(), catgets()
and catclose() and the gencat utility.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>SUN XView</b></span> with
functions gettext() and textdomain(). The GNU Project has its own
fully compatible release called GNU gettext.</p></li></ul></div><p>Usually programs, as well as system libraries, use one (or
even two) NLS systems.</p><p>Although XPG5 is included in the UNIX specification version
2, and all versions of UNIX systems support it, with Linux, GNU
gettext is the most popular solution.</p><p>The POSIX locale has the following components:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Locale API, i.e., subroutines like setlocale(),
isalpha(), etc.</p></li><li><p>Shell environment variables to manage locale
categories.</p></li><li><p>The locale utility to get information about the
current locale; see <b  >man locale</b> for more
details.</p></li><li><p>Objects of localization. The default directory for
their location is /usr/share/locale/.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ba0580.0x1c99b00"></a>Making a Program I18n-Compliant</h2></div></div><p>If you are going to write a real i18n program, it would be
wise to think that you know nothing about a specific language and
take charsets into account. Ideographic languages have many more
than 26 letters: Japanese has about 2,000, and Chinese has about
5,000. To deal with such characters, the POSIX locale has multibyte
and Wide Class (wchar_t). The latter is done for Unicode. To
convert one into another, functions like mblen(), mbstowcs(),
wctomb(), mbtowc() and wcstombs() are used. However, using Unicode
is beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>Producing real multilingual software is a complex task.
Hopefully, the GNU gettext system that now conforms with SUN XView,
will help you write i18n programs.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6176f1.large.jpg"><img src="6176f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Producing an i18n Program</p></div></div>
</p><p>Figure 1 represents all necessary steps for producing an i18n
program:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>To create an i18n version, you have to edit a
non-i18n program. If you use a special editor mode you will create
an additional file at the same time, called a POT file, where PO
stands for portable object, and the letter T is for
template.</p></li><li><p>If you merely make a revision of an existing i18n
program, or if a POT file does not exist, you have to use the
xgettext program to produce it.</p></li><li><p>Copy the template file into
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ll</em></span>.po, where <span   class="emphasis"><em>ll</em></span> refers to
a certain language.</p></li><li><p>Translate messages into the language
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ll</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>Create a <span   class="emphasis"><em>ll</em></span>.mo file with the
msgfmt program (mo stands for machine object). Sometimes you can
see gmo files (g stands for GNU).</p></li><li><p>Compile your source; put the binary program and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ll</em></span>.mo files into the right place. This and the
previous steps are better accomplished with a Makefile.</p></li></ul></div><p>Before looking briefly at all the steps of a simple program,
please read these golden rules of internationalization:</p><p>1) Put the following lines into the non-executable part of
your program, and mark messages in the source file as
<b  >_("<i><tt>message</tt></i>")</b> instead
of <b  >"<i><tt>message</tt></i>"</b> in the
executable part of the program and
<b  >N_("<i><tt>message</tt></i>")</b> in the
non-executable part. Pay attention to the output to guarantee
passing the strings declared as constants through gettext, i.e., in
the non-executable part:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;libintl.h&gt;
#include &lt;locale.h&gt;
#define _(str) gettext (str)
#define gettext_noop(str) (str)
#define N_(str) gettext_noop (str)
</pre><p>2) Start your program by setting the locale:
<pre     class="programlisting">
setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
</pre>


3) Indicate the message catalog name, and if necessary, its
location:
<pre     class="programlisting">
bindtextdomain(PACKAGE,LOCALEDIR);
textdomain (PACKAGE);
</pre>


PACKAGE and LOCALEDIR usually are provided either by config.h or by
the Makefile file.
</p><p>4) To check a symbol's properties and conversion, use calls
like isalpha(), isupper(), ..., tolower() and toupper().</p><p>5) To compare strings, use the strcoll() and strxfrm()
functions instead of strcmp().</p><p>6) To guarantee portability with old versions of locale, use
a variable of type unsigned char for symbols, or compile your
program with the -funsigned-char key.</p><p>Let's make a simple internationalized program in which these
rules are ignored (Listing 2). The program outputs an invitation to
type, reads a string from the terminal and counts the digits in it.
The results of this counting are output in the terminal, then the
program exits.</p><p><a href="6176l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. A Non-I18n
Program</a></p><p>Because the program is small, we can change it easily
according to the rules with your favorite editor; if the program is
large, it is better to use special tools. Editors like (X)Emacs or
vi with po mode can create a counter.pot file at the same time that
you are changing the program source!</p><p>The changed file is shown in Listing 3. Lines 4-8 are added
according to rule 1. Definitions from the locale.h file may not be
necessary; they may be included within the libintl.h definitions.
Writing gettext and gettext_noop many times is annoying, so we will
use macros, as defined in lines 6-8. Using
<b  >gettext_noop</b> is an example of pre-initialized
strings at the compile stage. A possible solution is shown in our
program where using <b  >gettext_noop</b> allows the
strings to be recognized by gettext at the time of
executing.</p><p><a href="6176l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. I18n Version of the
Program Shown in Listing 2</a></p><p>Without line 15 (rule 2), the program will not understand
your locale and will use the C locale. Note that sometimes it is
necessary to set special categories of locale, such as LC_CTYPE and
LC_MESSAGES. See <b  >man setlocale</b> and Table 1 in
this article for more information.</p><p><a href="6176t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Categories of Locle and
Shell Variables</a></p><p>Lines 16 and 17 were inserted according to rule 3. Usually
the parameters of these calls are provided in either a Makefile or
a special file (like config.h) that holds configuration
information, but in this program we put in the names directly.
According to line 16, searching will be started in the current
directory. If the line with the call is omitted, Linux will use the
default location, /usr/share/locale.</p><p>The call textdomain() <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be presented
in any i18n program. It points the gettext system to the filename
with i10n messages.</p><p>Lines 19, 25 and 26 where changed according to rule 1. Lines
19 and 25 are simple: instead of using strings directly, we call
them through gettext to use a message catalog. Line 26 demonstrates
the exception. We cannot transform strings defined in the
non-executable part through gettext because there the values are
initialized <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> running the program by the
compiler. The problem is solved according to rule 1. We marked the
strings with <b  >N_</b> in line 12 to make them
recognizable by xgettext; we used <b  >_(mess)</b>
instead of mess in line 26, as with normal strings. We do not need
to do more, because of the function isdigit (see rule 4).</p><p>Now the program is internationalized. Compiling and running
it, however, produces exactly the same result as the previous
non-i18n one. Messages from the counter.pot file have to be
translated into a specific language.</p><p>There is another way to create an initial .pot file. Once you
have an i18n program, you can use xgettext. This scans the source
files and creates corresponding strings for translation. In our
case, we can invoke it like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xgettext -o counter.pot -k_ -kN_ counter.c
</pre><p>where <b  >-o</b> is for output file name and
<b  >-k_ -kN_</b> is to extract strings that start with
corresponding symbols. Consult <b  >info xgettext</b> to
get more details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ba0580.0x20935b8"></a>Basics of Localization</h2></div></div><p>Typically, a programmer works on the source code, and a
translator deals with the corresponding .po file, which may be
created with the copy command from the .pot file or directly from
the source with the xgettext program.</p><p>Glance over a .po file, and you will see it has a header and
entries for translating. Here is an example of an entry:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# This is my own commentary
#: counter.c:25
#, c-format
msgid "You typed %d %s \n"
msgstr "Vous avez tap&eacute; %d %s\n"
</pre><p>It's simple. You translate phrases from msgid and put the
results into the msgstr fields. If a line starts with
<b  >#:,</b> it is a reference to the source; if it
starts with <b  >#,</b> it shows an entry's attributes.
You can add your own comments in lines starting with two symbols:
<b  >#</b> (the pound sign and then a white space).
</p><p>After copying the template .pot file information (.po) or
creating a new one with the xgettext command, you can start
translating. Generally, this job can be done by another person
using his or her favorite editor. (X)Emacs is not a bad choice for
this job, but KBabel, part of KDE, is an even better one. If you
are going to participate in a team of translators, it is highly
recommended that you use KBabel. Describing KBabel is beyond the
scope of this article, but you can read more about it in &ldquo;The
KBabel Handbook&rdquo; (see Resources).</p><p>Translation is a kind of art. Writing a correct phrase can be
difficult, and you sometimes may doubt your ability with a
particular language. So, you may want to leave some entries
untranslated, or having translated them doubtfully, mark them as
&ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo;. With KBabel or (X)Emacs, you easily can find such
entries and edit them again later. Do not worry; only fully
translated entries will be compiled later by msgfmt and become
usable in programs. This simply means that an entry may be marked
&ldquo;translated&rdquo;, &ldquo;untranslated&rdquo; or &ldquo;fuzzy&rdquo;, and as software
changes quickly, there is also an &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo; attribute.</p><p>Languages are flexible. English messages are not always
perfect either. In our case, the message &ldquo;You typed 0 digit&rdquo; is
incorrect. GNU gettext can manage translating problems like word
order, plural forms and ambiguities, but you have to use extra
functions that hold more arguments than gettext().</p><p>Once you have translated the file, you should convert it into
a .mo file that gettext will use if you run the program with the
corresponding locale. Do not forget to put this file in the right
place, in our case:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mv counter.mo fr/LCMESSAGES/
</pre><p>Now the counter can speak French! (See Listing 1.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ba0580.0x2093ae0"></a>Managing a Message File</h2></div></div><p>Programs evolve, and if their source code is changed, the
corresponding .po files also have to be updated. Using only
xgettext in this case is not an ideal solution. All translated
messages will be lost, because it overwrites .po files. In this
case, you should use the program msgmerge. This program merges two
.po files, keeps translations already made (if the new strings
match with the old), updates entries' attributes and adds new
strings. Of course, these new strings will be untranslated entries.
A typical call is simple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
msgmerge old.po new.po &gt; up-to-date.po
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ba0580.0x2093c40"></a>Final Remarks</h2></div></div><p>In this article, the input method is not described, although
it is also important. Generally, non-X11 software doesn't need to
worry about i18n input methods, because it is the responsibility of
the console and X terminal emulators.</p><p>For input in X11, three methods exist: Xsi, Ximp and XIM. The
first two are old-fashioned; the last one is the de facto standard.
Their descriptions are beyond the scope of this article; however,
the source code for the rxvt program provides an excellent
example.</p><p>Modern tools provide their own special subroutines for input
of internationalized strings, using gettext for output messages. To
make program code 8-bit transparent for internal proposals, Unicode
is used. Qt, for instance, works in such a way, providing
additional functions for input and output of i18n strings correctly
(see Resources).</p><p>You also may want to look at the source code of mutt, which
is a good i18n program
(<a href="http://www.mutt.org" target="_self">www.mutt.org</a>). This
program supports aliases for charsets.</p><p>Using Unicode in your programs is described by Tomohiro
Kubota (see Resources). Happy i18ning!</p><p><a href="6176s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
