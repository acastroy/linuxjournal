    Let one packet go to multiple addresses and you can save

kernel manages multicast traffic and how it is possible to interact
with it by simply patching some kernel code. Although this is a
rather specific topic, it might be useful for anyone interested in
multicast routing. If you want to monitor or modify any existing
multicast protocol, the information provided below will be useful.
</p><p>At the University of Milan, we are developing a new protocol,
CAMP (Call Admission Multicast Protocol), that uses information
provided by the multicast kernel code to make some important
decisions. We have to be able to receive notifications of important
events, such as JOIN or LEAVE requests. As you probably know, the
Linux kernel can act as a multicast router, supporting both
versions 1 and 2 of PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast,
<a href="http://netweb.usc.edu/pim" target="_self">netweb.usc.edu/pim</a>).
All the MFC (Multicast Forwarding Cache) update operations are
served completely by an external user-mode process interacting with
the kernel. In this article, we explain how the kernel manages
messages sent by the user-mode d&aelig;mon in order to update the
MFC. After this brief introduction we describe our hook
implementation in more detail. Figure 1 shows the topology of our
testing network. As you can see, SNOOPY is acting as a multicast
router running PIMd (version 2.1.0-alpha 29.9) on top of Linux
kernel 2.4.18.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6070f1.large.jpg"><img src="6070f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Test Network Topology
</p></div></div><p>All the multicast-related code of the kernel is located in
two files: ipmr.c (net/ipv4/ipmr.c) and mroute.h
(include/linux/mroute.h). Before we start looking at the code, it
is important to mention two other files: /proc/net/ip_mr_vif and
/proc/net/ip_mr_cache. As we will see later, these two files are
particularly useful for understanding the current state of the
multicast router. The ip_mr_vif file lists all the virtual
interfaces involved in multicast operations, while ip_mr_cache
exactly represents the state of the MFC.</p><p>Now, as an example, we start sending out multicast traffic
from VAIO to the address 224.225.0.1. Packets are received by
SNOOPY but are not forwarded to eth1 because no JOIN has been
issued by MAFALDA. When MAFALDA does issue a JOIN to 224.225.0.1,
the contents of the two proc files (on SNOOPY) are shown in Table 1
and Table 2.</p><p><a href="6070t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Content of
/proc/net/ip_mr/vif</a></p><p><a href="6070t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Content of
/proc/net/ip_mr_cache</a></p><p>In ip_mr_vif the two interfaces (eth0 and eth1) involved in
our multicast routing are listed, while the third interface
(pimreg) is a virtual device registered by the multicast management
code. In Table 2, you can see the route PIMd has built. Here,
packets coming from eth0 (Iif: 0) with a source address equal to
192.168.1.118 (Origin: 7601A8C0) and directed to 224.225.0.1
(Group: 0100E1E0) are forwarded to eth1 (Oifs: 1:--ignore the
second number at the moment). Now, we issue a LEAVE message from
MAFALDA. After a couple of seconds the content of
/proc/net/ip_mr_cache is updated, and the result is shown in Table
3.</p><p><a href="6070t3.html" target="_self">Table 3. Content of
/proc/net/ip_mr_cache after a LEAVE Message</a></p><p>We still have the same origin and group, but now the input
interface has been changed to -1, and we have no output interfaces.
This is because packets still are coming in from eth0, but because
nobody wishes to receive them on other interfaces, they are
dropped. When packets are dropped this way, a new entry is stored
in a special queue of unresolved addresses. To indicate this is an
unresolved address, the input interface is set to -1 and no output
interfaces are listed.</p><p>This operation of queuing unresolved packets is necessary for
a particular reason: receiving an IGMP packet and adding the
corresponding MFC entry takes a lot of time (about 2-3 seconds on
our test network and about 20-30 seconds on a bigger network with
interconnected multicast routers). When VAIO started transmitting
multicast packets in our previous example, there was a high
probability that the JOIN message from MAFALDA wasn't yet handled
by SNOOPY, and the corresponding MFC entry necessary to forwarding
packets was not already set up. So, in order not to lose the
packets received from VAIO while the JOIN request is handled and
the new MFC entry is added, they are queued in this special cache.
As soon as the MFC entry is added, the queue is cleaned up, and the
packets waiting in it are forwarded to the right destination.
Obviously, due to performance and memory restrictions, this queue
cannot grow too large. This is solved by simply adding a timer
function that periodically cleans up the cache of unresolved
entries (ipmr_expire_process()).</p><p>Now, let's take a look at the data structures involved in
this process (Listing 1).</p><p><a href="6070l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. The vif_device and
mfc_cache structures used by the multicast routing
code.</a></p><p>vif_device is a virtual device linked to a real network
adapter. The dev field is a pointer to the net_device structure
representing the real hardware interface. More interesting is the
mfc_cache structure. Its fields are self-explanatory and reflect
all the data shown in Tables 2 and 3.</p><p>The three main variables used in ipmr.c are as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* Devices              */
static struct vif_device vif_table[MAXVIFS];
/* Forwarding cache     */
static struct mfc_cache *mfc_cache_array[MFC_LINES];
/* Queue of unresolved entries */
static struct mfc_cache *mfc_unres_queue;
</pre><p>vif_table is simply an array of all the virtual devices
created by PIMd; mfc_cache_array represents the MFC; and
mfc_unres_queue is the list of unresolved entries described above.
Prior to analyzing the multicast management code, it is worth
spending a couple of words on the TTL array, a member of the
mfc_cache structure. Each value of the array is linked directly to
the vif_table. In fact, for each multicast address assigned to
every interface, we have a single byte value identifying the TTL
threshold. As we will see later, this value is compared to the TTL
field of each IP packet when deciding if the packet is to be
forwarded.
</p><p>We have seen the basic data structure of multicast routing,
so now let's take a look at how they are manipulated by the kernel.
All the functions are implemented in one single file, ipmr.c. Keep
in mind that the code in this file does not implement the routing
protocol itself. The functions you can find in ipmr.c are used by
the multicast routing d&aelig;mon (PIMd in our case) to manage
these data structures. Simply put, whenever PIMd decides it's time
to add or delete a route, it merely sends a message to the kernel
specifying the action that should be taken. PIMd, in order to do
that, must be able to receive IGMP packets; these are passed up to
user space by the kernel. PIMd communicates to the kernel in two
different ways: using ioctls and via the setsockopt() system call.
Both the vif and mfc tables are handled using the setsockopt()
system call.</p><p>In order to better understand how this is achieved we take a
look at some of PIMd's code as well. In particular, all the
functions communicating with the kernel are located in the kern.c
file of the PIMd distribution. Here, the function k_chg_mfc() is
responsible for adding or modifying an existing MFC entry, while
the deletion of an existing entry is performed by k_del_mfc(). In
order to tell the kernel how multicast packets should be forwarded,
some information similar to that listed in the mfc_cache structures
must be provided by the user d&aelig;mon. In particular, this
information is encapsulated in a new structure defined as mfcctl
(Listing 2).</p><p><a href="6070l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. The mfcctl used by
PIMd.</a></p><p>The fields in this example should be self-explanatory. It's
important to mention, though, the role of the mfc_ttls array in
this structure. As stated earlier, this value represents the TTL
threshold; however, it is treated in a slightly different way by
the user-mode d&aelig;mon. The function k_chg_mfc() must specify to
the kernel on which interfaces the multicast packet should be
forwarded. In order to do so, a list of the output interfaces must
be provided; the mfcc_ttls fills this role. The code snippet below
shows this point:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for (vifi = 0, v = uvifs;
     vifi &lt; numvifs; vifi++, v++)
{
if (VIFM_ISSET(vifi, oifs))
            mc.mfcc_ttls[vifi] = v-&gt;uv_threshold;
        else
            smc.mfcc_ttls[vifi] = 0;
}
</pre><p>Here, if an interface is indeed an output interface for a
particular multicast address, its TTL threshold is set to the real
value; otherwise it is set to zero. The kernel interprets the value
zero as a non-output interface for that particular group, and as a
consequence, it will set the corresponding byte of the mfc_cache
structure equal to 255 (decimal) and not forward the packets.
</p><p>Now, let's see what the kernel does when it receives a
request to add a new entry to the MFC. The type request is handled
by the ipmr_mfc_add() function. The kernel checks whether this is
an update request by looking for the current entry in the MFC. If a
matching item is found, the new TTL's values are copied into the
existing mfc_cache structure, and the minvif and maxvif values are
updated as well. These values indicate the minimum and the maximum
index values of all output interfaces for a particular multicast
address. The function performing this job is
ipmr_update_thresholds(). For your convenience, we include the
function shown in Listing 3, because it better explains the meaning
of the minval and maxval fields.</p><p><a href="6070l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. How the kernel updates a
current MFC entry.</a></p><p>Back to our ipmr_mfc_add() function; we now consider the case
where an existing MFC entry is not found. In this case, a new
structure is allocated and inserted into the MFC table. Once this
operation is completed, the kernel must perform one last action:
forwarding any unresolved multicast packet currently queued in the
mfc_unres_queue that might be directed to the newly added
destination node. In an affirmative case, packets are removed from
this queue and forwarded to the new interface. The other operation
that remains to be executed is the MFC delete. This one is pretty
straightforward&mdash;data structures are basically the same as what was
seen before. In order to remove a cache entry, the user-mode
d&aelig;mon invokes the k_del_mfc() function while the handler for
the kernel mode invokes the impr_mfc_delete(). This function simply
removes the specified entry from the MFC.</p><p>Now that we have identified where MFC entries are added,
modified and deleted, we can start hooking the multicast routing
code. Function hooking is a simple concept. Basically, a function
inserted in the middle of the code shown previously causes the
system to switch to an external function implemented in a kernel
module. In a way, the function implemented in the module can be
seen as a callback that is invoked every time an MFC entry is
added, modified or deleted. To implement this hooking mechanism, we
based our code on a well-known hooking architecture already
implemented in the 2.4.x kernel: the Netfilter interface. If you
have never used it before, suffice to say it's a popular interface
implemented within the kernel to allow packet filtering. The same
action that Netfilter performs with packets can be done easily with
arbitrary data structures&mdash;mfc_caches in our case. In particular,
the following is the prototype of the callback function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typedef void nf_nfy_msg(
    unsigned int hook,
    unsigned int msgno,
    const struct net_device
    *dev,
    void* moreData);
</pre><p>Here, hook represents the domain (this value always will
assume the PF_INET value); msgno represents the message number (the
action taken by the kernel, adding an mfc_cache entry, for
example); dev can assume the value of any current net_device
involved during the operation; and moreData is a void* pointer to a
generic data structure. This pointer is indeed a pointer to an
mfc_cache data structure.
</p><p>Now that we have seen the format of the callback let's see
how it can be invoked by the kernel. It's actually quite simple;
placing the following in the kernel code will invoke any registered
hook function for the specified action:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef NF_EVT_HOOK &amp;&amp; NF_MCAST_HOOK
    NF_NFY_HOOK(
        PF_INET,
        NF_NFY_IP_MCAST_MSG,
        IPMR_MFC_ADD,
        NULL,
        (void*) c);
#endif
</pre><p>However, the details about our hook architecture are beyond
the scope of this article. The reader will understand the code
better by looking at our modified kernel files [available from the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site at
<a href="../listings/103/6070.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue103/6070.tgz</a>]
or at the original Netfilter implementation.
</p><p>Now that we have had a complete overview of the multicast
routing implementation in Linux and a couple of notes about how to
implement a hooking mechanism, it's necessary to pinpoint a couple
of concepts we observed during our tests.</p><p>Let's go back to our testing network and imagine the
following scenario: SNOOPY is sending out multicast traffic, and
both MAFALDA and VAIO issue a JOIN request. You expect to see a new
multicast route with eth0 and eth1 as output interfaces.
Unfortunately, that is not what happens. Taking a look at
/proc/net/ip_mr_cache, you can see only a single route to MAFALDA,
but both MAFALDA and VAIO are receiving multicast traffic
correctly. Here's why: outgoing packets from SNOOPY are sent using
192.168.1.200 as a source address. For that reason, when sending
out data on eth0, SNOOPY will behave like it's sending out
multicast traffic on a LAN. That means SNOOPY will start sending
out packets on eth0 even before VAIO issues a JOIN, because the
kernel is unaware of the presence of a PIM d&aelig;mon able to
interpret IGMP packets coming from other PCs. In order to make
other workstations receive multicast traffic, it simply sends out
packets. This way, any other machine on the same network segment
can turn on the multicast hardware filter and pick up the desired
data from the wire. In a similar situation, multicast JOIN and
LEAVE requests cannot be hooked on the primary interface, because
on that interface the kernel is not exactly performing multicast
routing.</p></div></div>
