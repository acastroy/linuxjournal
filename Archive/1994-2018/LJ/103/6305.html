    The <i  >Linux Journal</i> web site provides many learning
    opportunities.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28ec580.0x29e43a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Parking my car this morning, the Tuesday
after Labor Day weekend, I noticed that the neighborhood skate park
was empty&mdash;the kids are back in school. Besides feeling a little
sad that my own back-to-school days are long gone, I thought about
all the ways our learning never stops.
</p><p>Along those lines, an abundance of tutorials have been posted
on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web site in the past
month or two. In the spirit of continuing education, I'll take this
opportunity to point out a few of these how-to articles, starting
with Jos Hartman's &ldquo;Building an Office Network from Spare Parts&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6207.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6207</a>).
This tutorial outlines how Jos and some other members of his church
built their office a new Linux-based network (from donated computer
parts) that spans 40 kilometers. When they were finished, they'd
built an office LAN, an internet server and a backup/testing
server.</p><p>If you're new to office suites or have recently switched from
StarOffice to OpenOffice, Ralph Krause offers two articles that
might save you some time on those daily office tasks.
&ldquo;OpenOffice.org Address Books and Form Letters&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6269.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6269</a>)
and &ldquo;Creating Web Pages with OpenOffice.org&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6289.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6289</a>)
explain how to perform tasks such as importing an existing address
book, connecting to LDAP servers, filtering an address book with
SQL queries to create form letters and creating web pages from the
various applications with OpenOffice.</p><p>On the other end of the user spectrum, Mike Petullo offered
the informative &ldquo;Amateur Video Production Using Free Software and
Linux&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/5817.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5817</a>).
Using only free software, Mike explains how to digitize analog
video sources for storage and manipulation, presents tools for
editing video on a computer and offers some options for publishing
digital videos, including the video CD (VCD) format that is
compatible with various DVD players.</p><p>Finally, for everyone wanting a laptop with Linux
pre-installed from the manufacturer, well, keep waiting. Until
then, however, Brian C. Lane's article, &ldquo;Installing Red Hat 7.3 on
a Compaq Presario 711CL Laptop&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6291.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6291</a>)
will help you put a Linux distro on your laptop&mdash;a process he
didn't find to be as dreadful as he'd heard. Brian discusses power
management and how to make sure your laptop is using the correct
kind, employing the acpid d&aelig;mon to track power events,
drivers for LinModem support and playing encrypted DVDs.</p><p>Learning something new is a daily occurrence; be sure to look
for new tutorials on the <i  >LJ</i> site. Articles are
available on the site dating back to 1994, and new ones are posted
every day.</p></div></div>
