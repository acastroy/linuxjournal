Watch out! Here comes the Networked Media Tank.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x29692a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux-powered devices are everywhere. They're so ubiquitous that 
Linux often isn't even mentioned. It's just <span   class="emphasis"><em>there</em></span>. One case in point is the
Popcorn Hour A-100. Linux isn't mentioned in the technical specifications
of the device at all. What is mentioned are the formats and codecs and
other capabilities of the device, and what a device it is.
</p><p>
The Popcorn Hour is a reference hardware implementation for a new
Linux-based middleware layer from Syabas Technology called the Networked
Media Tank. According to its Web site: &ldquo;The Networked Media Tank (NMT)
is a state-of-the-art integrated digital entertainment system that allows
you to watch, store and share digital content on your home network.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Think of tank in terms of fish, not Abrams or
Sherman. The
NMT is designed to be able to access all your media, no matter what
computer or networked storage system it resides on, and display it on
whatever television you connect to it. According to Syabas,
other devices are in the works from other manufacturers that will be using
the same NMT middleware and similar hardware.

Figure 1. Popcorn Hour and Everything That Comes in the Box
</p></div></div><p>
The Popcorn Hour is not designed to compete with your TiVo or MythTV box;
it can connect to on-line video streams and podcasts, but it doesn't
do live over-the-air (or cable) television. The closest device it
competes with, at least partially, is the Neuros OSD. The Neuros can
encode video though, which is something the Popcorn Hour can't
do&mdash;it's
strictly a playback device.
</p><p>
For me, the encoding capabilities of the Neuros OSD are not needed. I've already digitized most of my DVD library. I have a mix of media
in both MPEG-4.2 and H.264 formats, and the Popcorn Hour's support of
both formats was one of the things that attracted me to it over the
MPEG-4.2-only Neuros OSD. For more on the differences between MPEG-4.2
and H.264, see the When MPEG-4 Isn't MPEG-4 sidebar.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x2969880"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
When MPEG-4 Isn't MPEG-4</b></p><p>
Many people are familiar with what generically is known as MPEG-4 or
MP4 video. Popular implementations of this are DivX and Xvid, both of
which have found wide use on file-sharing sites. Technically though, DivX
and Xvid implement MPEG-4 Part 2. Much like MPEG-2 before it, the
MPEG-4 standard encompasses several different audio, video and file
format standards. There isn't space to go into too much detail on MPEG-4
here, so see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4</a> for more
information (a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span>
more). The main point I want to make about MPEG-4 Part 2 is
that even though when the first implementations were released it was hailed
as an excellent video codec that was far better than MPEG-2 video,
MPEG-4 Part 2's two main modes are known as the Simple or Advanced
Simple Profiles. In other words, they're the children of the MPEG-4
world. The &ldquo;all-grown-up&rdquo; video codec of MPEG-4 is Part 10, which is also
known as MPEG-4 AVC (Advanced Video Coding). The International
Telecommunications Union calls it H.264.
</p><p>
To avoid confusion, when I refer to MPEG-4 Part 2 in this article, I
call it MPEG-4.2 instead of Xvid or DivX or the generic MP4. And, when I'm
talking about MPEG-4 Part 10, I refer to it by the ITU name,
H.264.
</p><p>
Much as MPEG-2 is the format used on DVDs, H.264 video is the preferred
video format of Blu-ray discs. It also is becoming the preferred video
format for small devices, such as cell phones. This is because
H.264 was designed to provide video quality equivalent to MPEG-4.2 at
half the bandwidth. This efficiency comes at an increased processing
cost both to encode and decode, but since the standard was formalized a
few years ago, several chipsets have been developed to do the decoding
in hardware. Thus, even extremely small and low-power devices, such as
cell phones, can play back H.264-encoded video easily.
</p><p>
This is exactly what the Popcorn Hour does. It utilizes a Sigma Designs
SMP8635 chip, which, according to the manufacturer, provides MPEG-4.2,
H.264, VC-1, WMV9 and MPEG-2 decoding at up to 1080p resolution.
</p></div><p>
Another thing that caught my eye on the Popcorn Hour were the various outputs, which include
composite, component, S-Video and HDMI. I currently have a standard-definition television, but we plan on replacing it with an LCD-HDTV
before the end of the year, and the Popcorn Hour will work on both. It
can output NTSC, 480p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p among others.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10215f2.large.jpg"><img src="10215f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Ports on the Back of the Popcorn Hour
</p></div></div><p>
The Popcorn Hour casing is sleek and rather empty inside. Only about one-third
of the case is the actual hardware for the device. The other two-thirds
is reserved for installing your own ATA hard drive.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10215f3.large.jpg"><img src="10215f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The actual hardware takes up very little of the case.
</p></div></div><p>
Under full operation, and especially with a hard drive installed, the
Popcorn Hour becomes quite warm, so although the nice flat top of the unit
seems to be begging for something to be stacked on it, it's probably a
good idea to give it a little breathing room all the way around.
</p><p>
Installing a hard drive into the Popcorn Hour is essential if you want
to use it as a file server or BitTorrent client. For those uses, there
needs to be some sort of local storage. Installing a hard drive is as
easy as sliding it in and screwing it to the bottom of the case. All of
the necessary screws and cables are provided. One nice touch is that the
top of the case is attached with thumbscrews, so accessing the interior
is easy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x296a1c8"></a>
Initial Setup</h2></div></div><p>
Setting up the Popcorn Hour is easy. For basic operation, you simply
plug it in and turn it on. From the factory, the Popcorn Hour
is set to detect the appropriate video output settings automatically,
so after a few seconds of my television blinking, the startup screen
appeared and the main interface loaded.
</p><p>
The Popcorn Hour interface is attractive, but it is not flashy or
fancy. It is very serviceable, and it gets the job done.
</p><p>
If you have DHCP set up on your network, the Popcorn Hour will
connect automatically. Otherwise, you need to put in the appropriate
network settings manually. On my network, the Popcorn Hour was given the
IP address 192.168.1.148, which I mapped in my /etc/resolv.conf file to
popcorn, so in the examples in this article, that's what I use.
</p><p>
After the home screen appeared, my first step was to visit the Setup
section to set my default output settings&mdash;so it doesn't have to
scan for the correct setting every time it starts&mdash;and to install
the extra apps to the hard drive along with setting other preferences.
</p><p>
The initial step of installing the apps to the hard drive involves making
sure all firmware updates have been applied. The firmware upgrading
process was easy and took only a few minutes. Once the firmware is at
the latest version, the hard drive apps can be installed.
</p><p>
The apps can be installed over the Internet or from a USB key (if the
Popcorn Hour doesn't have an Internet connection). After installing the
apps, my next step was connecting it to my NFS server. The
process was easy once I actually read the documentation for the
proper URL formatting. By default, when specifying an NFS address, such as
nfs://fileserver/mnt/files, the Popcorn Hour tries to connect over
UDP. For my setup, I had to use nfs-tcp://fileserver/mnt/files, and then
it worked.
</p><p>
For my setup, I installed the NFS server and BitTorrent client. There
is also a Samba server option, but I don't have any Windows machines,
so I didn't enable it. Once installed and started, I was able to mount
the Popcorn Hour NFS share from any of my machines with the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t nfs popcorn:/opt/sybhttpd/localhost.drives/HARD_DISK 
 &#8618;/mnt/popcorn
</pre>
</p><p>
The brief documentation that comes with the Popcorn Hour is
Windows-centric, so I had to use the showmount command to discover what
the export was called on the Popcorn Hour, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
danielb@d610:~$ showmount -e popcorn
Export list for popcorn:
/opt/sybhttpd/localhost.drives/HARD_DISK 192.168.1.0/
&#8618;255.255.255.0
</pre>
</p><p>
The on-line forum and wiki also came in very handy whenever I had similar
questions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x296a698"></a>
Testing the Popcorn Hour</h2></div></div><p>
One of my first orders of business after the initial setup was out of
the way was to test the capabilities of the Popcorn Hour to see whether
it could play all the formats advertised.
</p><p>
For video tests, I used <span   class="emphasis"><em>Big Buck Bunny</em></span> from the Open Movie
Project. This Creative Commons-licensed animated short is available at
<a href="http://bigbuckbunny.org" target="_self">bigbuckbunny.org</a> in several video formats and sizes. The sizes
range from 1920x1080 pixels (1080P) at the high end down to 320x180 pixels
at the low end. For each size, there is a selection of container formats,
including AVI, Ogg, M4V and MOV. Each container format has a different
video format inside it, including MPEG-4.2, H.264, MS MP4 and Theora. The
audio is in MP3, AAC, AC3 and Vorbis formats. These various versions
provide a pretty good test suite for the capabilities of any video player.
</p><p>
The only container format it doesn't have is Matroska (.mkv). This,
however,
was not an insurmountable problem, because it is simple to create it,
thanks to mkvmerge. For more on this and the Matroska container format,
see the Matroska sidebar.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x296a900"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Matroska</b></p><p>
According to the Matroska home page, &ldquo;Matroska aims to
become <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> standard of multimedia container
formats.&rdquo; A lofty goal to be
sure, but it's making progress due to the tremendous flexibility the
container format has.
</p><p>
The main trick that Matroska has over other container formats is that it
can support multiple audio and video streams inside a single file. This
enables you to, for example, have multiple selectable languages to go
along with the video portion of the file. If you think that sounds like a
DVD, you're on the right track. Many people feel that the era of
physical formats, like DVDs and
Blu-ray discs, is coming to an end. In fact, many of them feel that Blu-ray
is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>last</em></span> physical format. The only problem with this line of
thinking is that if the world moves away from physical formats, whatever
replaces them should be able to do everything (or almost everything)
they can do. This includes multiple languages, alternate video
streams, subtitles in various languages and other features. The LGPL-licensed
Matroska is trying to become that format.
</p><p>
Matroska containers can contain nearly any
audio and video format, and one of the ways for putting those
formats into a .mkv file on Linux is with mkvmerge. The mkvmerge
tool can be downloaded as part of the mkvtools package from
<a href="http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html" target="_self">www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html</a>. Follow the
directions for your distribution to install it.
</p><p>
To change the container of any video file from whatever it is to Matroska,
simply launch the mkvmerge GUI, and click the Add button to open the
file you want to convert. By default, it will save the output .mkv file
to the same directory. If you want to change that, click on the Browse
button in the lower-right corner of the window, and choose where you want
to save it. Finally, click the Start muxing button, and mkvmerge will
begin the process of extracting the audio and video from the existing
container and putting it all into a Matroska container. Because the tool
is not converting the audio or video to a different format, the process
is lossless and does not take long.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10215fi.large.jpg"><img src="10215fi.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The mkvmerge program is very easy to use.
</p></div></div><p>
If you want to do the muxing from the command line, the GUI tool offers
a Copy to Clipboard button that gives you the command and all of
the options that it will do when you press the Start muxing button. The
general command is this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkvmerge -o "destination-file.mkv"  -a 1 -d 0 -S 
 &#8618;"original-file.avi" --track-order 0:0,0:1
</pre>
</p><p>
At the end of the process, you will have a Matroska container with whatever
audio and video you copied out of the other container inside of it.
</p><p>
For more on Matroska, see <a href="http://matroska.org" target="_self">matroska.org</a>.
</p></div><p>
The most dominant video format of the past ten years (or more) has been
MPEG-2, the format DVDs use. Thankfully, the Open Movie Project
has me covered there too. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Big Buck Bunny</em></span> can be downloaded as a DVD
ISO file from Archive.org (<a href="http://www.archive.org/details/BigBuckBunny" target="_self">www.archive.org/details/BigBuckBunny</a>),
which can be burned to a DVD or simply opened by the Popcorn Hour (more
on playing ISO files later).
</p><p>
The Fast Forward button on the remote works as advertised for all
supported video files. Rewind works with varying levels of success on
.avi, .mov and .m4v files. Rewind did not work at all with the .mkv
files I have. Hopefully, a firmware upgrade will fix this.
</p><p>
All the video formats I tried worked with the exception of Microsoft's
implementation of MPEG-4.2 (msmp4) and the Theora-encoded version. I
also noticed some slight jitteriness with the 1080p versions when I
played them off my NFS server. They played without a hitch when the
files were on the local hard drive. The scaling that the Popcorn Hour
applied to the large files to shrink them down to my television screen
looked flawless. There was pixelation (naturally) when I played the
smaller versions that had to be scaled up, but they still were very
watchable. Audio playback likewise was flawless.
</p><p>
For audio tests, I tried a variety of files, including MP3, FLAC, Ogg
Vorbis and M4a. The Popcorn Hour had no problems with the MP3 and FLAC
files, but it would not play the Ogg or M4a files. The failure of the M4a
files was surprising, as both the M4a container and the AAC audio
format are listed as supported. More than 95% of my music is in either MP3
or FLAC format (with FLAC being the preferred format), so the lack of
M4a and Ogg support is not that big of a deal, but I hope they will be
enabled at some point.
</p><p>
One thing I should note is that the Popcorn Hour does not play any sort
of DRM-infected content. So, if you've been purchasing things from iTunes
and/or similar digital stores that cripple their content, the Popcorn
Hour probably is not a good purchase.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x2d635f8"></a>
BitTorrent</h2></div></div><p>
One of the big selling points of the Popcorn Hour is the built-in
BitTorrent client. My experience with it has been mixed.
</p><p>
On one hand, the BitTorrent client works. On the other hand, it's very
painful to use with the remote. I do like the fact that I can check on the
status of torrents I am downloading or seeding right on my television,
but anything more than that (like setting up the schedule) is difficult
at best. Thankfully, there is a Web interface that is much easier to use.
</p><p>
The Web interface has all the features of the TV interface with the
addition of an upload interface to add new torrents. To add torrents
to the list, you first need to download the .torrent file to your
desktop and then connect to the Web-based torrent front end and upload
the file through that. The address for the Web-based front end is at
<a href="http://popcorn:8883/torrent/bt.cgi" target="_self">popcorn:8883/torrent/bt.cgi</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10215f4.large.jpg"><img src="10215f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The BitTorrent service can be controlled via a Web front end.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x2d639c0"></a>
Content Providers</h2></div></div><p>
The Online Services area has a lot of content preconfigured for
it. The biggest section is the Media Service Portal, which is filled
with dynamically updated content from various providers, such as YouTube,
Revision3, DLTV, SayaTV, Vuze, Mevio and even a selection of podcasts
from the NBC, CBS and CNN news networks.
</p><p>
There also are slots for adding podcasts (video or audio) of your
own. Simply choose the Edit link from the Online Services page, and
then enter the title of the podcast and the RSS feed URL. After saving
your changes, when you select the newly created entry, the Popcorn Hour
will fetch and parse the RSS and give you a link to the audio or video
file. Select it, press the Enter button, and the podcast will play after
a delay. The length of the delay is dependent on your Internet bandwidth
and the size of the file you are downloading. In my testing with some
large-format (480p and up) video podcasts, the Popcorn Hour had trouble
downloading the files and even crashed a couple times. So, although it's nice
that the Popcorn Hour can connect to RSS podcast feeds that I specify
directly, a much more reliable solution for me is to download them on
my local file server and then access them through the NFS share.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x2d63b20"></a>
DVD Playback</h2></div></div><p>
The Popcorn Hour can play DVDs either from a USB DVD-ROM drive plugged
in to one of the USB ports or from a DVD ISO file. There is one huge
caveat to this ability, however; it can't play encrypted DVDs, which
basically covers nearly all commercial DVDs and ISO files of those
DVDs. The only DVDs I found in my collection that can be played directly
by the Popcorn Hour are the ones I purchased at the dollar store
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Big Buck Bunny</em></span> from the Open Movie Project.
</p><p>
Assuming you have some unencrypted DVDs or ISO files, playing
them is similar to using any off-the-shelf DVD player. One note though:
playing an ISO of a DVD off of a network share takes a lot of bandwidth,
so you'll have your best luck with NFS and a wired connection as opposed
to Samba and/or a wireless connection.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x2d63cd8"></a>
myiHome</h2></div></div><p>
For people who don't want to go to the trouble of setting up an NFS or
Samba server, there is another option for sharing media from your computer to
the Popcorn Hour: myiHome. The myiHome application can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.networkedmediatank.com/download/myihome.html" target="_self">www.networkedmediatank.com/download/myihome.html</a>.
There are versions for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.
</p><p>
For Linux, you simply download a tar.gz file. Untar it, and you will have
a folder named something like myiHomeLinux-v5.0.2. Inside this folder
is a startserver.sh script. Running this script starts myiHome.
To stop it, simply press Ctrl-C, and it will quit.
</p><p>
Once the server is started, it shows up in the list of media sources
on the Popcorn Hour automatically. On Linux, the server automatically
looks in your home directory for folders named My Videos,
My Music and My Pictures.
</p><p>
After connecting to a myiHome server, you can set various preferences
from the television interface, such as selecting the photo folder to
use as a slideshow source when playing back music and vice versa, among
other things.
</p><p>
When navigating music or video folders on a myiHome server, you have the
option to play the contents randomly with the Shuffle command. There also is
a Search button that you can use to find specific tracks or photos.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x2d63f98"></a>
The Remote</h2></div></div><p>
Navigating with the remote is easy; you simply use the arrow keys on the
remote and the Enter key to select things&mdash;much like navigating DVD
menus. To go up a directory, use the Return key. The combination
number/letter keys are used during initial configuration when setting
network settings and configuring shares, and I haven't had much use for
them since.
</p><p>
The DVD-specific keys (Menu, Title, Angle and so on) work as expected
with DVDs, but are useless otherwise.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10215f5.large.jpg"><img src="10215f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Popcorn Hour Remote
</p></div></div><p>
My biggest complaint about the remote is the location of the Page Up
and Page Down keys. They're way up in the top-right corner. A much
better location would have been next to the arrow keys.
</p><p>
There is a Suspend BT button on the remote that the manual says is
for suspending all BitTorrent traffic with one click. It does not work
at the time of this writing, but the promise is that a firmware update will enable
it (hopefully, by the time you read this). I hope it's sooner rather than
later, because although it isn't hard to suspend BitTorrent traffic, it does
take several clicks with the remote to do it, and you have to stop whatever you're
watching or listening.
</p><p>
There also are some colored buttons at the bottom of the remote that
don't do anything at the moment.
</p><p>
One trick I learned was that if you want to play everything in a folder,
first navigate into the folder and then press the Play button. If
you want to play only a single file, highlight the file and press the
Enter button. Also, when playing a file, you need to press the Stop
button before you can use the Return or Home buttons.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2871580.0x2d64410"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The Popcorn Hour is a very capable little box. It plays a wide variety
of music and video formats&mdash;provided they aren't encumbered with DRM.
</p><p>
Right now, there are several unfinished pieces, but thankfully,
firmware updates are coming regularly, and each one unlocks more
functionality. Despite the rough spots, I have to admit I am perfectly
happy with the core functionality, and I recommend it 
(as long as you don't have a lot of DRM-infected content). It is well
worth the modest purchase price of $179.
