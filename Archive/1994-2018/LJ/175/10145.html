As a general-purpose programming language, Python's
benefits are well recognized. With the help of some
add-on packages, you can use Python for scientific
computing tasks as well.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x2509250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As computers become more and more powerful, scientific computing is becoming
a more important part of fundamental research into how our world works. We
can do more now than we could even imagine just a mere decade ago.
</p><p>
Most of this work has been done traditionally in more low-level languages,
such as C or FORTRAN. Originally, this was done in order to maximize the
efficiency of the code and to squeeze out every last bit of work from
the computer. With computers now reaching multi-GHz speeds, this is no
longer the bottleneck it once was. Other efficiencies come into
play, with programmer efficiency being paramount. With this in mind,
other languages are being considered that help make the most of a
progammer's time and effort.
</p><p>
This article discusses one of these options: Python. Although Python is an
interpreted language and suffers, unjustly, from the stigma that
entails, it is growing in popularity among scientists for its clarity
of style and the availability of many useful packages. The packages
I look at in this article specifically are designed to provide fast, robust
mathematical and scientific tools that can run nearly as fast as C or
FORTRAN code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x2509510"></a>
Getting Set Up</h2></div></div><p>
The packages I focus on here are called numpy and scipy. They
are both available from the main SciPy site (see Resources). But before we download them,
what exactly are numpy and scipy?
</p><p>
numpy is a Python package that provides extended math capabilities. These
include new data types, such as long integers of unlimited size and complex
numbers. It also provides a new array data type that allows for the
construction of vectors and matrices. All the basic operations that
can be applied to these new data types also are included. With this we
can get quite a bit of scientific work done already.
</p><p>
scipy is a further extension built on top of numpy. This package
simplifies a lot of the more-common tasks that need to be handled,
including
tools such as those used to find the roots of polynomials,
doing Fourier transformations, doing numerical integrals and enhanced
I/O. With these functions, a user can develop very sophisticated
scientific applications in relatively short order.
</p><p>
Now that we know what numpy and scipy are, how do we get them and
start using them? Most distributions include both of these packages,
making this the easy way to install them. Simply use your distribution's
package manager to do the install. For example, in Ubuntu, you would type
the following in a terminal window:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install python-scipy
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x2509778"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This installs scipy and all of its dependencies.
</p><p>
If you want to use the latest-and-greatest version and don't want to
wait for your distribution to get updated, they are available through
Subversion. Simply execute the following:

 
<pre     class="programlisting">
svn co http://svn.scipy.org/svn/numpy/trunk numpy svn co
http://svn.scipy.org/svn/scipy/trunk scipy
</pre>
</p><p>
Building and installing is handled by a setup.py script in the source
directory. For most people, building and installing simply requires:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python setup.py build
python setup.py install    # done as root
</pre>
</p><p>
If you don't have root access, or don't want to install into the system
package directory, you can install into a different directory using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python setup.py install --prefix=/path/to/install/dir
</pre>
</p><p>
Other options also are available, which you can find out about
by using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python setup.py --help-commands
</pre>
</p><p>
Take time to experiment and see whether you can use any of
the extra options in your specific case.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x2509bf0"></a>
Basic Math</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have scipy and numpy installed, let's begin our tour by
looking at some of the basic functions that are often used in scientific
calculations. One of the most common tasks is matrix mathematics. This
is greatly simplified when you use numpy. The most basic code to do
a multiplication of two matrices using numpy would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import numpy
a1=numpy.empty((500,500))
a2=numpy.empty((500,500))
a3=a1*a2
</pre>
</p><p>
Contrast this to what we would need to write if we did it in C:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main() {
   double a1[500][500];
   double a2[500][500];
   double a3[500][500];
   int i, j, k;
   for (i=0; i&lt;500; i++) {
      for (j=0; j&lt;500; j++) {
         a3[i][j] = 0;
         for (k=0; k&lt;500; k++) {
            a3[i][j] += a1[i][k] * a2[k][j];
         }
      }
   }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The Python code is much shorter and cleaner, and the intent of the code is
much clearer. This kind of clarity in the code means that the programmer
can focus much more on the algorithm rather than the gritty details
of the implementation. There are C libraries, such as LAPACK, which
help simplify this work in C. But, even these libraries can't match the
simplicity of scipy.
</p><p>
&ldquo;But what about efficiency?&rdquo;, I hear you ask. Well, let's take a look
at it with some timed runs. Taking our above example, we can put some
calls around the actual matrix multiplication part and see how long each
one takes. See Table 1 for the results.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2411580.0x2509f60"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 1. Average Runtimes</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 1. Average Runtimes10145t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Language</th><th>Average Time (seconds)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>
C</td><td>1.620</td></tr><tr><td>
C (-O3)</td><td>0.010</td></tr><tr><td>
Python</td><td>0.250</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Although your mileage will vary, because these times depend on your hardware
and what other programs also are running on your machine, we can see a
general trend. The Python code actually was about eight times faster than
the C code compiled with no command-line options. That is actually
quite surprising. Once we use the optimization command-line option, we
see that the C code is now faster, by a factor of approximately 25. So,
we can get faster code using optimized C, but we need to realize that
multiplying two matrices with 250,000 elements each in one-quarter of a
second is probably fast enough.
</p><p>
As well, we get a certain amount of protection when we use Python. What
happens if we try to multiply two matrices where such multiplication
doesn't make sense mathematically? When we try to multiply two matrices
of different sizes, Python gives us:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ValueError: shape mismatch: objects cannot be 
 broadcast to a single shape
</pre>
</p><p>
In C, we get no error at all. This due to the fact that when we work
with matrices, we actually are using pointer arithmetic. So pretty much
anything we do is valid C, even if it makes no sense in the problem
domain.
</p><p>
We also can work just as easily with complex numbers. If we wanted to
create an array of 64-bit complex numbers, we would write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
a=zeros((500,500), dtype=complex64)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x250a7a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which would give us a 500x500 element matrix initialized with zeros. We
access the real and imaginary parts of each element using:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
a.real[0,0]=1.0 a.imag[0,0]=2.0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x250a900"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which would set the value 1+2j into the [0,0] element.
</p><p>
There also are functions to give us more complicated results. These
include dot products, inner products, outer products, inverses,
transposes, traces and so forth. Needless to say, we have a great
deal of tools at our disposal to do a fair amount of science already. But
is that enough? Of course not.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x250aa60"></a>
Getting Down to &ldquo;Real&rdquo; Science</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we can do some math, how do we get some &ldquo;real&rdquo; science done? This
is where we start using the features of our second package of interest,
scipy. With this package, we have quite a few more functions available
to do some fairly sophisticated computational science. Let's look at
an example of simple data analysis to show what kind of work is possible.
</p><p>
Let's assume you've collected some data and want to see what form
this data has, whether there is any periodicity. The following code lets
us do that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import scipy
inFile = file('input.txt', r)
inArray = scipy.io.read_array(inFile)
outArray = fft(inArray)
outFile = file('output.txt', w)
scipy.io.write_array(outFile, outArray)
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, reading in the data is a one-liner. In this example, we
use the FFT functions to convert the signal to the frequency domain. This
lets us see the spread of frequencies in the data. The equivalent C or
FORTRAN code is simply too large to include here.
</p><p>
But, what if we want to look at this data to see whether there is anything
interesting? Luckily, there is another package, called matplotlib, which
can be used to generate graphics for this very purpose. If we generate a
sine wave and pass it through an FFT, we can see what form this data has
by graphing it (Figures 1 and 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10145f1.large.jpg"><img src="10145f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Sine Wave
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10145f2.large.jpg"><img src="10145f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. FFT of Sine Wave
</p></div></div><p>
We see that the sine wave looks regular, and the FFT confirms this by
having a single peak at the frequency of the sine wave. We just did some
basic data analysis.
</p><p>
This shows us how easy it is to do fairly sophisticated scientific
programming. And, if we use an interactive Python environment, we can do
this kind of scientific analysis in an exploratory way, allowing us to
experiment on our data in near real time.
</p><p>
Luckily for us, the people at the SciPy Project have thought of this and
have given us the program ipython. This also is available at the main SciPy
site. ipython has been written to work with scipy, numpy and matplotlib
in a very seamless way. To execute it with matplotlib support, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ipython -pylab
</pre>
</p><p>
The interface is a simple ASCII one, as shown in Figure 3.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10145f3.large.jpg"><img src="10145f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. ipython Window
</p></div></div><p>
If we use it to plot the sine wave from above, it simply pops up a
display window to draw in the plot (Figure 4). 
</p><p>
The plot window allows you to save your brilliant graphs and plots, so
you can show the entire world your scientific breakthrough. All of
the plots for this article actually were generated this way.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10145f4.large.jpg"><img src="10145f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. ipython Plotting
</p></div></div><p>
So, we've started to do some real computational science and some basic
data analysis. What do we do next? Why, we go bigger, of course.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x2502000"></a>
Going Parallel</h2></div></div><p>
So far, we have looked at relatively small data sets and relatively
straightforward computations. But, what if we have really large amounts
of data, or we have a much more complex analysis we would like to run? We
can take advantage of parallelism and run our code on a high-performance
computing cluster.
</p><p>
The good people at the SciPy site have written another module called
mpi4py. This module provides a Python implementation of the MPI standard.
With it, we can write message-passing programs. It does require some work
to install, however.
</p><p>
The first step is to install an MPI implementation for your machine
(such as MPICH, OpenMPI or LAM). Most distributions have packages for MPI,
so that's the easiest way to install it. Then, you can build and
install mpi4py the usual way with the following:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
python setup.py build python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
To test it, execute:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
mpirun -np 5 python tests/helloworld.py
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x25022c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which will run a five-process Python and run the test script.
</p><p>
Now, we can write our program to divide our large data set among the
available processors if that is our bottleneck. Or, if we want to do
a large simulation, we can divide the simulation space among all
the available processors. Unfortunately, a useful discussion of MPI
programming would be another article or two on its own. But, I encourage
you to get a good textbook on MPI and do some experimenting yourself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x2502420"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Although any interpreted language will have a hard time matching the speed
of a compiled, optimized language, we have seen that this is not as big
a deterrent as it once was. Modern machines run fast enough to more than
make up for the overhead of interpretation. This opens up the world of
complex applications to using languages like Python.
</p><p>
This article has been able to introduce only the most basic available
features. Fortunately, many very good tutorials have been written and
are available from the main SciPy site. So, go out and do more science,
the Python way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x2502580"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
ScientificPython</b></p><p>
numpy and scipy are not the only options available to Python programmers.
Another popular package is ScientificPython. It includes geometric types
(such as vectors, tensors and quaternions), polynomials, basic statistics,
derivatives, interpolation and more. This is the same type of functionality
available in scipy. The major difference is that ScientificPython has the
ability to do parallel programming built in, whereas scipy requires an
extra module. This is done with a partial implementation of MPI and an
implementation of the Bulk Synchronous Parallel library (BSPlib).
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x2502790"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
LAPACK and BLAS</b></p><p>
The argument can be made that comparing the complexity of C and FORTRAN to
that of Python is unfair, because we actually are using add-on packages in
Python. Equivalent libraries can be used in C and FORTRAN, with LAPACK and
BLAS being some of the more popular. BLAS provides basic linear algebra
functions, while LAPACK builds on these to provide more complex scientific
functions. Although these libraries provide optimized routines that will
extract every useful cycle from your hardware and are much simpler to write
than straight C or FORTRAN, they still are orders of magnitude more complex
than the equivalent in Python. If you really do need to squeeze out every
last tick from your machine, however,
nothing will beat these types of libraries.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2411580.0x25029a0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Types of Parallel Programming</b></p><p>
Parallel programs can, in general, be broken down into two broad
categories: shared memory and message passing. In shared-memory
parallel programming, the code runs on one physical machine and uses
multiple processors. Examples of this type of parallel programming include
POSIX threads and OpenMP. This type of parallel code is restricted to the
size of the machine that you can build.
</p><p>
To bypass this restriction, you can use message-passing parallel code. In
this form, independent execution units communicate by passing messages back
and forth. This means they can be on separate machines, as long as they have
some means of communication. Examples of this type of parallel
programming include MPICH and OpenMPI. Most scientific applications use
message passing to achieve parallelism.
