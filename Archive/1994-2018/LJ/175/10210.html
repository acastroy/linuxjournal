Bashing Arithmetic</h4><p>
I was surprised to see Dave Taylor imply that the magic bash variable
$RANDOM is a feature of $(( )) arithmetic syntax [see &ldquo;Movie Trivia
and Fun with Random Numbers&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, August 2008]. It is just a magic
variable that can be used anywhere. Likewise, there is no need to use both
$(expr) and $(( )); one or the other is sufficient. In particular, lines
like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pickline="$(expr $(( $RANDOM % 250 )) + 1 )"
</pre>
</p><p>
could have been simplified to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pickline=$(( $RANDOM % 250 + 1 ))
</pre>
</p><p>
I might also mention in passing that double quoting is redundant in variable
assignment, even if the expression would normally be unsafe without
quoting.

<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span>
Thanks for your note. I didn't mean to imply that $RANDOM was part of the
$(( )) notation, but I will say that in my experience it's far more useful
in that context than elsewhere I use it. Finally, although the double quotes
are occasionally unneeded, I find that a consistent style (for example, always
quote variable assignments) helps with debugging.

End of TV?</h4><p>
In reading Doc Searls' article on the end of analog TV and seeing his
background [see &ldquo;What Happens after Next February?&rdquo;,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, September 2008],
I had to speak up and say, &ldquo;Yes, I was there too in those
days.&rdquo; I have
tinkered with radio, most of my life&mdash;K9LD. Wire recorders, 21 tube
television sets, tall towers with long yagi's. I started in computers when it
was diodes and telephone relays, DEC, right on up until now. I would rather
write programs than anything else.
</p><p>
Point being, I believe TV will just die. You can download your movies and
watch them when you want. Every home has a PC running something. I
subscribe to Netflix, and would rather that instead of mailing out the
DVDs, they would put it all on a point-and-click basis&mdash;ah, those copyright laws though. 
Someone will come up with a scheme to where your programming, which is all
we are interested in with television anyway, will be selected and viewed
on your computer&mdash;whether it's 20 inches, handheld or, dare I say it, built
in to your glasses.

I'm partway through reading Eric Pearce's article on a 16TB backup NAS
(essentially), and I really have to compliment his writing [see
&ldquo;One Box. Sixteen Trillion Bytes.&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>,
August 2008]. It's simple,
direct and honest (&ldquo;here are the things I thought about doing, but
didn't have the time to try&rdquo;, and &ldquo;FYI: I'm not sure about these options in
practice, but maybe they could improve performance&rdquo;), and I truly appreciate
that.
</p><p>
I find that very often technical people (microbiologists, analytical
chemists, IT workers and so on) paralyze themselves into quiescence because they want to
present not just a problem but a solution&mdash;and not just any solution, but a
very thoroughly thought-out and &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; and utterly defensible solution.
The honesty and practicality that Eric shows in his article is a kind of
triumph of what he actually accomplished over the common tendency to
&ldquo;self-paralysis&rdquo;. It's his writing this down as he did that really
impressed me.
</p><p>
I'm glad there is a forum like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> where the writers can be that
open and (I urge all of us, including myself when I'm ornery!) the readers
keep their criticisms technical.

I am not a computer specialist and neither do I have any interest in
computer code. But, I use a computer most of the day, every day. Having been
stuck with Windows (which I don't like because of the way everything I do
is controlled by Microsoft), I recently bought a small laptop with Linux as
the operating system. It is an absolute disaster area. For a start, it is
incompatible with 3 mobile broadband (I have read a number of blogs and
even the experts agree on that). I have had no success in loading Java,
which is essential for the work I do. And, I can't even load a 56K modem for
emergency use. In short, it is totally useless to me, and I am going to have
to load up Windows XP instead&mdash;much against my wishes. I had hoped that
Linux was a serious competitor to Microsoft, but in reality, it is
light-years away, strictly for computer specialists. Of course, I could spend days
and days reading up on how to make it work, but why should I? I only want
to use the computer, not re-invent it. Kernels, shells, command
prompts&mdash;these things are of no interest to me whatsoever. It's back to the dark days
of MSDOS all over again.

I feel your pain. It is so frustrating to buy a computer, especially
one preloaded with Linux, only to have it fail during normal,
everyday tasks. You didn't mention the brand or vendor of your
laptop, but I could name a handful of &ldquo;Linux-friendly&rdquo; vendors
shipping laptops that seem crippled when they arrive.
</p><p>
My suggestion would be to purchase a laptop from a vendor like
EmperorLinux&mdash;one that is known for retro-fitting Linux into computers and
doing it well. As for the laptop you currently own, there still
might be hope, but I'd need more details to point you in the right
direction.
</p><p>
It's frustrating as a Linux evangelist when vendors sell pre-installed
computers that don't work quite right. I assure you, it's not a Linux
thing, but rather a vendor thing. If a vendor shipped a Windows
notebook without the drivers, I'd venture to guess it would be even
less useful than your Linux laptop.

I was excited to read about the mobile version of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Web site [go 
to <a href="http://m.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">m.linuxjournal.com</a> to try it out], as it
will be perfect not only for my Nokia N800, but also my new Acer Aspire One
running Linpus Linux Lite. Speaking of the One, I really enjoyed the
articles by Marcel Gagn&eacute; and Victor Gregorio regarding text-mode browsers
and the Mutt e-mail program, respectively [see &ldquo;Browsers with the
Speed of Lightning&rdquo; and &ldquo;Power Up Your E-Mail
with Mutt&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, September 2008]. After trying
several browsers, I settled on
ELinks and have been trying it out on my Aspire One. I just installed Mutt
and will be trying to configure it as soon as I send this message.

Thanks for another great issue! I just subscribed, and my first print
issue should be arriving next month.

I was very interested when I read
&ldquo;Over-the-Air Digital TV with Linux&rdquo; by Alolita Sharma
in the July 2008 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>.
</p><p>
I purchased the Pinnacle PCYV HD Pro Stick and was disappointed to find
that they have recently changed chipsets. The 801e now utilizes the
DIBcom 0700C-XCCXa-G. It seems that the community has just recently
started reverse-engineering the stick. I have decided to keep the unit,
anxiously awaiting the community support. In the meantime, I will be
supporting the &ldquo;made for Linux&rdquo; pcHDTV.

I'm a little baffled at the article on Xara Xtreme included in the
September 2008 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. How old is that article? It states:
&ldquo;Until last year, Xara X was a professional, closed-source, Windows-only
commercial app...&rdquo;
</p><p>
Huh? Xara Xtreme has been available for Linux since October 2005. The
article also fails to note that development on the open-source version
ended about two years ago, owing to the fact that the rendering engine was
being kept proprietary, and thus, FOSS contributors lost interest. I'm
guessing this article was written two years ago, at least. You might want to
check the date on your mayonnaise if this kind of stuff is slipping by.
Care to comment?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Alan C. Stegerman  <br><br>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dan Sawyer replies:</b></span>
When I got your comment, my immediate reaction was, &ldquo;that can't be
right&rdquo;, so naturally, I returned to my notes and dug around on the Web.
Dating the open sourcing to last year was an oversight. I wish I had a
good excuse, but I don't. The proper date is there in my notes, and I
should have seen it when I was fact-checking the article before I sent
it in. It's a gross oversight&mdash;thank you for pointing it out. I'd
rather be corrected on an error, so that people don't carry away inaccurate
information from one of my articles.
</p><p>
As for the development controversy, I hadn't heard about it before your
letter. After receiving your message, forwarded on to me by my
editor, I dug. And dug. And dug. And eventually, I stumbled upon a blog
that mentioned the matter in passing and linked to the developer's listserv
group. Here's what I learned.
</p><p>
The latest I can ascertain is that there was, at some point this time
last year, an effort to port Xara Xtreme to Cairo away from CDraw, in
order to fix the problem (the acquisition of Xara by another company
evidently pooched the effort to open source the CDraw library), and that
most community involvement has stalled for the time being until that fix
is back on-line. Xara either currently hosts or has made space to host
the Cairo fork (the information I can find is unclear on this point).
This doesn't change my opinion that it's a project that deserves a lot
more attention (in fact, I think it reinforces the point). The code base
is still available; the listserv is still running; and the SVN is still
accepting commits. Xara open sourced a hell of a program, and it'll be
a crying shame if its hiatus turns into a death on the vine.
</p><p>
Thanks for bringing the matter to my attention.
