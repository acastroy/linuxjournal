us, he seems like the perfect candidate to use Linux. He agrees, and tells
us about it.

and I hope you'll bear with me.

Cory Doctorow
</p></div></div><p>
An internationally sought-after activist on copyright and DRM issues,
Doctorow is an ardent proponent of the Creative Commons, releasing
all his own work under CC licenses on the Internet, regardless of their
primary publishing format. A lifelong Mac devotee, a bit more than a year
ago,
he switched to Linux. I caught up with him on his <span   class="emphasis"><em>Little
Brother</em></span> book
tour and arranged an interview to talk about his experience with Linux.
What follows is an excerpt of the conversation.
</p><p>
Note: to those of you who have never met him or who plan to interview him on
your podcast, be aware that I caught him on an off day. When we talked,
he was jet-lagged and exhausted, and he still spoke at a consistent 148
words per minute. And for him, that's slow!
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
What's the deal with your Linux switch? You used to be a Mac guy, right?
</p><p>CD:
Yup, I mean, obviously, always Linux on the server, yeah, but I was always
Mac on the desktop for a long time, starting with Apple II Plusses
in 1979, and then Macs all my life&mdash;one or two a year minimum over
the years.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
What prompted the switch, and what do you think so far?
</p><p>CD:
Well, there are a couple things&mdash;the DRM stuff keeps getting
worse and worse. It seems like every time I turned around, Apple is
doing something with its OS to add more bullshit to it. More DRM,
more controls on how users use it....They're anti-features. There's no
customer who woke up this morning and said, &ldquo;Gosh, I wish there was
a way I could do less with my music this morning&mdash;I hope there's an
iTunes update waiting for me.&rdquo;
</p><p>
So, it just seemed to me, increasingly, that Apple wasn't making computers
to suit my needs; they were making computers to suit the needs of some
theoretical entertainment giant. And, you know, I think that's their
business if they want to do it, but they're not a charity, so if they
don't want to make the stuff I want to buy, I don't have to buy it.
Which is exactly what I did&mdash;I stopped buying it.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
And this despite the noises that Steve Jobs keeps making about removing
DRM from the iTunes store?
</p><p>CD:
...they keep saying that. Meanwhile...Audible...has the exclusive
contract to deliver audiobooks to the iTunes store&mdash;and is now actually
the largest audiobook seller in the world by far (they're owned by Amazon
now), and Audible won't turn the DRM off on their audiobooks, even when
the authors and the publishers ask them to. And, it's not just when it's a
weird little indie. With my latest book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Little Brother</em></span>, the audio edition
is published by Random House audio&mdash;they're the largest publisher
in the world; they're part of Bertlesmann....So, you know, if Steve Jobs
really felt like he didn't want DRM, he would be setting things up so
there were competitors of Audible in the iTunes store who were offering
stuff without DRM.
</p><p>
...Meanwhile you have Steve Jobs running around saying&mdash;at one point
he made this big speech&mdash;how you should never allow your videos to be
available in HD if you're a movie studio executive, unless you are assured
that no one is going to make an HD burner or ripper that will be capable
of making your DVDs....So it seems awfully mealy-mouthed, basically.
</p><p>
So [the switch to Linux] just seemed like the right idea. And then the
other thing that happened was that I wanted a computer in a &ldquo;color
other than black&rdquo;....There is a certain elegance to going into an
Apple store and saying, &ldquo;well, I want a Pro machine&rdquo;, and they
say,
&ldquo;well, this is the Pro machine and you can get it in fast, faster
or fastest&rdquo;. But at the same time, it was awfully refreshing to walk
into the EmperorLinux Web store and have this incredible variety of CPUs
to choose from. And Emperor's been pretty good to me. I'm on my
second machine from them now. They have very, very responsive service.
Every once in a while, I run into some problems that I think are endemic
to Linux&mdash;where, I think in hindsight I made a mistake. I bought
the next model up from the tiny, little ThinkPad I've been loving. I had
an x50 and decided I wanted an x51 for the additional speed and power.
And, frankly, the drivers weren't there and still aren't entirely there.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
Other than driver issues, what other problems or good points have you
run into so far?
</p><p>CD:
Well, for the good stuff, it's all around Synaptic for me&mdash;and it's
not just Synaptic as a package manager, but it's just the idea that
there is a suite of tools that are guaranteed to work with your machine
(more or less), where the cost of pulling the wrong tool is zero, and
where they're open&mdash;so, if there are problems you can get them fixed.
So that's really nice.
</p><p>
Let's say I need vector graphics&mdash;well, let's just go into Synaptic
and type &ldquo;vector&rdquo; and see what comes up. All right, there's nine
packages&mdash;let's try them all! Okay, this one's good.
</p><p>
That's pretty cool&mdash;that's actually really, really cool. 
</p><p>
The downside has been that, especially for larger projects, the process
by which you submit bugs&mdash;especially hard bugs&mdash;is way beyond my
ability as a user to fiddle with....
</p><p>
...If I want to submit a bug to OpenOffice.org, and it forces me to do an
e-mail loop to the Bugzilla, and the e-mail loop success takes
14 hours to go through, and the e-mail loop confirmation message goes to my
junk-mail folder, so I have to spend 14 hours checking my junk-mail folder,
remembering over and over again that I have to check it. And then when
I'm through it, actually filing the bug against Bugzilla is crazy. It's
just not an easy procedure.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
I've gotten taken to task a lot with reader feedback for the reviews
I write, because I don't always submit bugs when I bitch about things,
but it's for exactly this reason. I'm not a coder.
</p><p>CD:
Yeah. And I totally understand why they want a membrane between
submitters and programmers. I have a membrane between me and people who
want to submit stuff to BoingBoing, which is the &ldquo;submit a
link&rdquo; file.
The fact is that the &ldquo;submit a link&rdquo; page&mdash;when we've turned that
off and we've given people easier ways to send us feedback and send
us posts&mdash;the proportion of good stuff we got barely changed, but the
proportion of bad stuff we got went way up. And by &ldquo;bad
stuff&rdquo;, I
mean spam, stupid suggestions and so on....So I think it's kind of a
truism that &ldquo;fools and wreckers look for easy targets&rdquo;, whereas
people of good will tend to hunt around. The problem is that it's
very frustrating when you're experiencing a bug, and it's often nearly
impossible to really get to it.
</p><p>
...And The GIMP too. I use The GIMP every day, all day long, and there's
a persistent bug...that shows up when if I open a file, edit the file,
and then delete the file, The GIMP crashes. And, that's my actual
standard work flow, which is, take a screenshot of a Web page that I'm
going to put on BoingBoing, open it in The GIMP to edit it. Save it.
Upload it to my server, then delete it. And then The GIMP crashes.
So basically, every time, I have to wait for The GIMP to load up.
</p><p>
It's kind of a dumb bug, and my guess is that it has to do with the
&ldquo;recent files&rdquo; menu, but it's just a general pain in the ass, and I've
never figured out how to submit bugs up to The GIMP. So yeah, it's
that kind of thing I find very, very frustrating, but I understand why
it's there. And I also have problems with drivers or proprietary
hardware&mdash;which I understand is not Linux's fault&mdash;but that lack
of driver stuff is very, very frustrating at times. Like I have a Wi-Fi
bug with my Wi-Fi card that's apparently well known....So it doesn't work
properly with B networks. I was staying at a hotel all last weekend in
Los Angeles that had a B network, and...after about five minutes, the machine
would lose the ability to route packets until I rebooted it....And then, if
I tried to open too many sockets at once&mdash;like to get my RSS reader to
run&mdash;then it would just crash entirely. The machine would hard-freeze.
</p><p>
So this was unbelievably frustrating. I've encountered bugs of that
gravity in the Mac OSes. At least with this stuff, I was able to call
up someone I know at Canonical and say I had this problem, and he said,
&ldquo;Yes, that's a well-known problem and we don't know how to fix
it.&rdquo;
But at least it was a well-known problem...
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
And you know not to spend your whole day banging your head against the
wall trying to fix it.
</p><p>CD:
Yeah, that's it exactly. 
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
You got into Linux because Apple squeezed you out with the DRM shit.
Beyond just giving us an operating system that's not governed by that
kind of crappy politics, what other significance do you think Linux has
in the copyright and patent and IP wars?
</p><p>CD:
...In every DRM negotiation...there's always, at some point, some coercive
mechanism by which the manufacturers and the consortium get together
and require of the implementers that they implement in a way that is
resistant to user modification. It's kind of easy to see why you would
want DRM to be resistant to user modification, because the point of DRM
is that you're designing a computer that's adverse to its user. So, if
you're going to be adverse to the user, it doesn't do to have the user be
able to modify the system, because the user is the attacker in that model.
</p><p>
This is the opposite of FOSS....There's no such thing as open-source DRM
for that reason&mdash;and to the extent that there is, it involves things
like code signing, which is really outside the spirit of open-source
software&mdash;it violates the Four Freedoms if not the letter of the
license....So wherever you have a DRM consortium you have a conspiracy
to fight open source, and wherever that happens, you have a really good,
chewy policy argument, because open source is generally considered by
most IT ministries and policy-makers and so on to be of really important
value to national economies, national autonomy, national security and
all of that stuff. So, creating a mandate, as they tried to do with the
Broadcast Flag, requires that the government would require of hardware
designers that they design their hardware to resist user modification
is such a nonstarter when put in those terms. When put in the terms
that &ldquo;well, you realize that this is a prohibition on FOSS&rdquo;, that
really gives us a lot of power to derail those DRM mandates. DRM always
involves some kind of mandates....
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
There's no market demand on it.
</p><p>CD:
Right. Some manufacturers might have an incentive to do it because
they'll be offered some kind of special privilege by the entertainment
industry...but when that happens, it <span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> to be everybody. It has to be
all the manufacturers that go along with it; otherwise, you wind up with
a situation like you had a couple years ago where the big
&ldquo;legit&rdquo;
manufacturers were abiding by the Region Controls in DVDs and all the
little guys weren't, and the little guys were clobbering the big guys
because everyone wants region-free DVD players.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
Yup. I literally walked down to Wal-Mart and paid $30 for a region-free
player.
</p><p>CD:
Yeah, and then what you end up with is that the big guys turn around and
say, &ldquo;Look, I know we agreed that we'd implement this region coding
stuff, but we're not going to implement this region coding stuff&rdquo;,
because tiny, little two-man outfits in garages in Asia are kicking Sony's
ass and Sony can't be having that.
</p><p>
So, you end up with this kind of Prisoner's Dilemma.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
Particularly in a situation where you have Sony owning movie studios as
well, you've got an internal fight going on at the vertically integrated
companies.
</p><p>CD:
Absolutely. So Sony or whoever needs an assurance that everyone's going
to play ball, and without a mandate, that doesn't happen. So that means
that wherever the mandate is arriving, if you can show the policy-makers
who will be making the mandate stick that they're about to ban FOSS,
it can often sway the debate, so that's kind of a big way in which DRM
and FOSS kind of interact with each other, and in which FOSS is so vital
to that debate.
</p><p>
I'm sure there are other ways. Obviously, between CC and FOSS there's the
kind of QED&mdash;the demonstration that you can do it a different way,
that there isn't just one way of doing it. And so wherever people say,
&ldquo;we need higher fences and stronger laws, otherwise no one will invest
and no innovation will take place, and there will be no good
equipment&mdash;no good software, no good hardware and so on&rdquo;, then to the extent
that you have FOSS in the marketplace that eschews that and CC licenses
that eschew that, you've got something very powerful as well.
</p><p>
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>Note: Doctorow then went on to tell of successes in this area, such
as the defeat of Informem in Europe. The discussion is too lengthy to
reproduce here.</em></span>]
</p><p>
...So the last thing is, that where you have this stuff available
at a low cost and low barrier to entry, it creates in users a set of
expectations of what they can and can't do with media, so I think that it
doesn't necessarily naturally occur to people that, for example, you can
record a television show to a DVD. That doesn't always naturally occur.
You kind of have to see it being done and then have it taken away from
you to get worked up about it....
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
It's human nature to expect &ldquo;now&rdquo; to last forever, despite the fact
that we're used to an incredibly rapid rate of change and development.
</p><p>CD:
Exactly. So FOSS tends to be more richly featured, and so as a result
it creates new expectations from users about what they can and can't do
with their equipment.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
To swap tracks again to your other big advocacy area&mdash;privacy. What
privacy tools and techniques can you recommend for beginning Linux users?
</p><p>CD:
I've been using GPG for a while now, and I'm actually finding it very easy
to use, once I got it up and running. Although, again, it's not the best
integration I was hoping for. I've got GPG running with Thunderbird,
and I want it to sign every e-mail I send automatically, and I actually
have to mouse over and click an icon every time I want to sign an e-mail,
so if I don't remember, it won't sign all my e-mails, so it's just kind
of a pain in the ass, and I can't believe there isn't a switch in an
obvious place for that.
</p><p>
...TOR was incredibly useful to me when I was in China last year.
It just seemed to me like, over and over again, the sites I wanted to
visit were being blocked by the firewall, so I was able to get to them
that way. And, I use TOR in other ways too&mdash;I mean, there are plenty
of times when I try to get on-line, and I just find myself not able
to access one site or another, and TOR just fixes it, which is great.
I have FoxyProxy on Firefox, which allows me to turn on
or turn off TOR automatically when I need it, and my friend Seth Shoan helped me with
a little script to tunnel my mail over TOR....so I'm sending SMTP over
SSH over TOR, which is great.

<span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
One of the things I run into with GPG or with encrypted IMs or SELinux,
which ships with almost every distribution now, is that they're all
commonly available, most of them are easy to use, and the vast majority
of people don't. Why?
</p><p>CD:
Yeah. We undervalue our privacy because the cost of losing it is so
far in the future, and again very speculative, so we tend to assume that
because it doesn't cost us anything to lose our privacy today, it won't
cost us anything to lose our privacy tomorrow, and that's generally a
bad bet. So we don't worry about encrypting our hard drives until we
lose our laptops&mdash;oh, and that's the other thing I do. I encrypt my
hard drive, and I also just figured out how to use Cryptix with SD cards
as well.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
So, tell us a bit about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Little Brother</em></span>. What's it about, why
the title, and how does it tie in to your other advocacy?
</p><p>
CD:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Little Brother</em></span> is a novel about hacker kids in the Bay Area who,
after a terrorist attack that blows up the Bay Bridge, decide that
there are worse things than terrorist attacks, which, after all, end.
Those things include the authoritarian responses to terrorists, which have
no end, which only expand and expand. When you're fighting a threat
as big and nebulous as terrorism, there's virtually no security measure
that can't be justified. And so they find themselves caught inside an
ever-tightening noose of control and surveillance, and they decide that
they're going to fight back. They do so by doing three things: they use
technology to take control of their technology, so they jailbreak all
of their tools and use them to build free, encrypted wireless networks
that they can communicate in secrecy with. The second thing they do is
get better at understanding the statistics of rare occurrences so
that they can control the debate. So they start to investigate how,
when you try to stop a very rare occurrence with a security measure,
the majority of things you end up stopping won't be the rare occurrence
because the rare occurrence happens so rarely. So they start to show
how automated surveillance and automated systems of suspicion and control
disproportionately punish innocent people and rarely if ever catch
guilty people.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>DS:</b></span>
Yeah, you're actually having this problem in London now, aren't you?
</p><p>CD:
Oh, well, absolutely. We've got massive surveillance networks here, but
it's in the US as well. You've got the hundreds of pages of no-fly-list
names. People who are so dangerous that they can't be allowed to get
on an airplane but so innocent that we can't think of anything to charge
them with....And then, finally, they get involved in electoral politics,
because no change endures unless it can be cemented into place and
shellacked over with law. You might be able to convert this year's
government to the cause, but...in order to make it endure, you have to
make it into a law that every government that comes afterward has to
abide by. And so for these three measures, they end up changing society
and changing the whole world.
</p><p>
The novel is very explicitly didactic. Every chapter has instructions
and information necessary to build technology that can help you fight
the war on the war on terror. So, from setting up your own TOR node,
to building a pinhole camera detector, to disabling an RFID tag, it's in
the book. We did a series of &ldquo;instructables&rdquo;&mdash;little
how-tos for
building this stuff with kids that can be used as science-fair projects
or home projects, and people have taken some of this stuff to heart.
There's a notional Linux distro in the book called Paranoid Linux that's
kind of an amalgam of all the different security-conscious Linux distros
out there, and there are people trying to build a Linux distro based on
Paranoid Linux, which is pretty exciting.
