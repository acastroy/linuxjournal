When I first started using computers, &ldquo;High-Performance
Computing&rdquo;
basically meant how fast a person could type. People were considered high
performance if they could type faster than the IBM electric typewriter
could smack out the letters. In fact, if you haven't seen a race
between a person on a manual typewriter versus a person on an IBM Selectric
&ldquo;golfball&rdquo; typewriter, you haven't lived. 
</p><p>
Times quickly changed, however, and now instead of counting characters per
second, we use terms like petaflops. Although arguably more funny to
verbalize, petaflops don't really measure the same thing as characters
per second. In an abstract notion, however, they both measure &ldquo;how much
stuff&rdquo; a piece of hardware can churn out. This issue is thankfully
dedicated to high-performance computing, not high-speed typing. If I
pitched an issue focusing on the IBM Selectric typewriter, I have a
sneaking
suspicion it would be my last issue as Associate Editor.

Our writers came through this month and, indeed, focused on high-performance computing. In fact, James Gray takes us to the headquarters of
the Roadrunner supercomputer. It's not exactly the type of system most
people can build in their bedrooms, but a fascinating look at some real
horsepower. If such setups seem too &ldquo;pie in the sky&rdquo; for you, fear
not. We have a bunch of other articles that you can dig right into.
</p><p>
You can supercharge your programming by using CUDA and leveraging some of
the GPU processor time to bend to your will. Robert Farber explains how.
Or,
perhaps you'd rather take advantage of your high-performance operating
system and replace your hardware RAID setup with a Linux-powered software
RAID system. Will Reese shows the advantages of doing such a thing,
along with instructions on how to do it.
</p><p>
There's a lot to be said for writing good code, however. Often, if the
code is good, even a regular desktop machine can act like a
high-performance beast. Reuven Lerner provides a big roundup of books that is
sure to help along the way to some high-performance code. A word of
warning, however; you may need to buy another bookshelf.
</p><p>
What if you're just a Linux desktop user like me? Well, we didn't
leave you out. Marcel Gagn&eacute; shows you how to streamline your blogging habits
by utilizing the new microblogging services out there. Twitter? Identi.ca?
Jisko? Yep, plus more. Marcel explains how to make microblogging as
efficient and effective as possible, and these days, high-performance blogging
is 140 characters or less.
</p><p>
If you hate the whole Twitter concept, fear not. Kyle Rankin shows how
to streamline your desktop experience with Compiz. I'm suspicious that
Kyle just wanted to prove Compiz was a legitimate addition to a business
desktop, when, in fact, he just likes wiggly windows. He, of course, would
deny any such thing. Check out his column, and see what you think.
</p><p>
Can a person be a high-performance device in the Open Source world? If so,
Cory Doctorow would be a supercomputer when it comes to open standards and
free information. This month, we have an interview with a man on
the front line fighting against DRM. As you can imagine, he has some kind
words to say about Linux. You won't want to miss it.
</p><p>
Just like every other month, we have our regular cast of columns, reviews
and tech tips. Whether you're looking for information on installing and
securing Samba or you're interested in solving programming tasks with
Python, this issue will be one you'll want to read from cover to
cover. As for me, I think I'm going to go dig out that old IBM
Selectric and see if I can still type faster than it can print. For some
reason, I suspect I might not be as awesome as I remember (but I am
hot&mdash;<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/extra-shawn-powers-hot" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/extra-shawn-powers-hot</a>).
