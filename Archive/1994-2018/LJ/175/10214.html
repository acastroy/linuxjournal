<span   class="emphasis"><em>VDrift</em></span>&mdash;Open-Source Drift Racing Simulator (<a href="http://vdrift.net" target="_self">vdrift.net</a></h2></div></div><p>
To start off this month, I deal with my petrol-head side straightaway and look at the racing simulator <span   class="emphasis"><em>VDrift</em></span>. For those who read my column
last month, you may recall I made a brief mention of this project. This
month, I take a more in-depth look at it. To quote the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>VDrift</em></span> is a cross-platform, open-source driving simulation made with drift
racing in mind. It's powered by the excellent Vamos physics engine. It is
released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2. It is currently
available for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X and Windows (Cygwin).
</p><p>
This game is in the early stages of development but is already very
playable. Currently the game features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
19 tracks: Barcelona, Brands Hatch, Detroit, Dijon, Hockenheim, Jarama,
Kyalami, Laguna Seca, Le Mans, Monaco, Monza, Mosport, Nurburgring
Nordschleife, Pau, Road Atlanta, Rudskogen, Spa Francorchamps, Weekend
Drive and Zandvoort.
</p></li><li><p>
28 cars: 3S, AX2, C7, CO, CS, CT, F1, FE, FF, G4, GT, M3, M7, MC, MI,
NS, RG, RS2, SB, T73, TC, TL, TL2, XG, XM, XS and Z06.
</p></li><li><p>

</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
I was pleasantly surprised by this project's main installation method,
as it eschews all of the usual repository and source stuff and uses
Autopackage instead. I've always been a big fan of Autopackage,
because it combines the perks of a Windows-style package installation
(double-click, Next, Next, Next, Finish&mdash;you get the idea) with the
added structural benefits of a UNIX-style architecture. There is a source
file buried deep under several layers of the Web page, but the choice given
for Linux on the main page is an Autopackage, so we'll stick with that here
and hopefully annoy some pedantic Debian developers in the process&mdash;the natural enemy of the Autopackage!
</p><p>
Grab the package and save it somewhere locally. Once it's downloaded,
you need to flag it as executable (don't worry, this is just a once-off), either by turning the executable option on for the file in the
file manager of your choice, or by entering the following at the command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod u+x VDrift-2007-03-23-full-2.package
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can run the package simply by clicking on it, and follow the Next,
Next, Next prompts. You can choose to install it locally or system-wide, depending on whether you have a root password. Note that
you <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> run this from the command line, but it's a bit like mixing
12-year-old Scotch with Coke&mdash;it just defeats the purpose. If
this is your first time with an Autopackage, before
<span   class="emphasis"><em>VDrift</em></span> installs,
Autopackage installs itself to your system along with a neat
Add/Remove Programs-style utility called Manage third-party software
in your system menu, where you can remove <span   class="emphasis"><em>VDrift</em></span> (or any other
Autopackages) later if you want. Don't worry; this also is a one-time-only
process. Autopackages will skip straight through to installing
after you have Autopackage on your system.
</p><p>
During the installation, Autopackage checks your system for
compatability, and if it encounters any problems, it tells you in the
installation window. If you are missing any needed requirements, you
can install them in the meantime and run the Autopackage again simply by
clicking on it. In terms of libraries, the documentation says you 
need the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
libsdl: simple direct media layer.
</p></li><li><p>
libglew: OpenGL extension utilities.
</p></li><li><p>
sdl-gfx: graphics drawing primitives library for SDL.
</p></li><li><p>
sdl-image: image file-loading library for SDL.
</p></li><li><p>
sdl-net: low-level network library for SDL.
</p></li><li><p>
vorbisfile: file-loading library for the Ogg Vorbis format.
</p></li><li><p>
libvorbis-dev: the Vorbis General Audio Compression codec.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once the installation process is over, <span   class="emphasis"><em>VDrift</em></span> should install itself under
your menu, somewhere along the lines of Games&rarr;Simulation&rarr;VDrift.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
The first thing you should do is crank up the graphics as much as
humanly possible. The default graphics level is <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> conservative,
and even with the graphics turned up, it still has the occasional feel of
&ldquo;ye olde Pentium 133&rdquo;. So, head to the Options&rarr;Display
section, and then
go to the Advanced section below. Texture size, Anisotropic filtering,
Antialiasing and Lighting quality will all have a big effect on the look
of the game. Back in the main Display section, you can switch between
full-screen and windowed mode, as well as change the resolution. If
you want to make life easier, you can choose between either miles or
kilometers per hour, and enabling the track map really helps when driving
somewhere unfamiliar.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2352580.0x244bb68"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>VDrift</em></span> Controls</b></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
W: gear up.
</p></li><li><p>
S: gear down.
</p></li><li><p>
Up arrow: accelerate.
</p></li><li><p>
Down arrow: brake.
</p></li><li><p>
Left/right arrows: steering.
</p></li><li><p>
Spacebar: handbrake.
</p></li><li><p>
F1&ndash;F6: camera angles.
</p></li></ul></div></div><p>
Given the general emphasis on physics, you really do get the feeling that
this game is meant to be controlled by a steering wheel. If you have one,
please, plug it in. In the Controls section, you can tweak any wheel,
pedals, joystick or joypad options under Joystick Options as well as
adjust the force feedback settings. If you're a poor bloke like myself,
and you can't afford a steering wheel and are stuck with a keyboard, you'll
want to turn on the driving aids, such as traction control, ABS and
the auto-clutch. I also found that to have any feel without constantly
spinning off, I had to change Speed Affect on Steering to 100%.
</p><p>
Enough of this boring setup rubbish though, let's drive! Head into
Practice Game, and select a car and a track. Remember, the physics
engine is very harsh on driving and will show no quarter to any
need-for-speed arcade-racer types. Do not glue the accelerator down! Just keep
dabbing at it to begin with&mdash;particularly if you're using a
keyboard&mdash;until you gain more confidence. I found the MC (Mini Cooper) and the XG
(which appears to be some kind of BMW, perhaps a 5 series) to be the
easiest cars to drive, and the easiest track is Weekend Drive, which
had easy corners and will give you an initial feeling for the game.
</p><p>
The default view is behind the wheel, and at a fairly low graphics
level, it will not give much of a speed sensation. Things just don't
look that fast even in real life unless you have a lot of objects whizzing
by your side, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>VDrift</em></span> is fairly minimal in terms of road-side 
distractions. I recommend keeping a close eye on the speed to
begin with instead of just feeling it, so you can compare it to real
life. In real life, would you take that corner at 73mph? No, you'll
understeer into the railing or your back end will swing out. So, 
practice for half an hour on something long and twisty,
such as the Nordschleife Nurburgring circuit, which is simply epic and
one of the longest circuits in the world. This track is incredibly
hard, and you'll keep coming off, but the corners are endless, and you'll
learn to adapt very quickly to the harsher aspects of this game. Mind you,
I am a bit of a masochist, so if it puts you off, try another track!
</p><p>
The early development bugs do show through almost immediately in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>VDrift</em></span>. I
found that restarting a track would cut the sound out, and when I tried to
change graphical options, things kept resetting and would rarely stay
the same between game sessions. When I was driving, I often ran into
the kind of jumping physics that have always plagued large 3-D games,
especially when you stray from the track. Several times after coming
off a tricky hairpin, I had to restart the track. Racing is still
pretty rudimentary, and it's not always obvious what you're doing, so
things are still best in one-player mode. But, look
past this, because you can see that so much passion and research went into
this project, with its amazing touches and brilliant locations.
</p><p>
Yes, this game does have a lot of bugs, but it's allowed to&mdash;it's in
development. You may curse and swear at this incomplete game, which is
often ugly and quite harsh to play (and definitely not friendly
to beginners). But, ten seconds later, a moment will come when everything
looks beautiful, you're in the zone, control is coming naturally and an
authentic touch by a big fan will put a huge grin on your face. There
really is a large sense of ambition with this game, and if you can look
past the early development flaws, you'll find a real gem. The code
currently is being rewritten as a side project called Refactor,
so I <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> hope this game sees the support and development it
deserves, because it could be brilliant&mdash;definitely one to watch.

CharTr&mdash;Mind Mapping Tool (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chartr" target="_self">code.google.com/p/chartr</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
CharTr is an artistic piece of software made for fun to give mind mappers
good usability. For those unfamiliar with mind
mapping, Wikipedia says the following:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
A mind map is a diagram used to represent words, ideas, tasks or
other items linked to and arranged radially around a central key word or
idea. It is used to generate, visualize, structure and classify ideas,
and as an aid in study, organization, problem solving, decision making
and writing.
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10214f4.large.jpg"><img src="10214f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Here's me going off on a creative bent with CharTr.
</p></div></div><p>
Currently, its stated features are as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Basic mind map with curved links.
</p></li><li><p>
Link folding.
</p></li><li><p>
Colors.
</p></li><li><p>
Outline box of several selected nodes.
</p></li><li><p>
Audio/text/images embedded as notes.
</p></li><li><p>
Automatic saving.
</p></li><li><p>
SVG, PNG, PDF and PS export.
</p></li><li><p>
Numerous keyboard shortcuts (with an eased keyboard navigation, vim-like).
</p></li><li><p>
Idea bookmarking.
</p></li><li><p>
Search for text in nodes.
</p></li><li><p>
Math equations. 
</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
CharTr does have a few obscure requirements, so you should look
through your repositories. You need Python, PyGTK, Cairo, GStreamer,
Numpy and python-plastex for mathematical equations. Once you have
these sorted out, head to the Web site where you have a choice of a source
tarball or Debian package.
</p><p>
If you grab the .deb package, install it by entering the following in
a terminal from whichever directory contains the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo dpkg -i chartr_0.16_i386.deb 
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, run CharTr by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ chartr
</pre>
</p><p>
If you get the source version, download and extract the tarball, and
then open a terminal in the new CharTr directory.
</p><p>
You need to invoke Python manually, by entering the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python chartr.py 
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once inside, click that big shiny New button, and a new window
appears, called a Map. In the big expanse of white, left-clicking 
brings up a text cursor allowing you to type in some text. Press Enter,
and the text is placed inside a box. The first of these is yellow,
allowing for a central idea from which others ideas can flow. If you
click on the original box and add some text somewhere else on the map,
it is placed in a blue box, and a black line links to it. Right-clicking
lets you move the map around, and if you look at the toolbar
at the top, you can zoom in and out, as well as add images. If you check
the drop-down box toward the right, you also can add bits of audio,
notes or some already-provided icons&mdash;very handy! Once you've finished
making a mind map, you can export it to a picture file. Check the
documentation page at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chartr/wiki/CharTrDocumentationEn" target="_self">code.google.com/p/chartr/wiki/CharTrDocumentationEn</a> for more
information on general usage.
</p><p>
All in all, this is a nice and simple application with some great aesthetics
that will find favor with students and teachers alike. It's still buggy
for the moment, but I hope to see it included in major distros,
especially educational ones.
