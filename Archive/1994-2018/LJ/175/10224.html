Build a secure file server with cross-platform compatibility.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea2580.0xf9a460"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It recently occurred to me that in the eight years or so I've been writing
this column, I've never covered file servers. I've covered secure
file <span   class="emphasis"><em>transfer</em></span>, for example, via scp, rsync and vsftpd,
which certainly is important.
But, I've not covered file serving, specifically, allowing users to mount persistent
&ldquo;network volumes&rdquo; that let them use networked server disk space
as though it were a local disk. This has all sorts of productivity- and
operations-related benefits: it's (usually) easy for end users to use, and
it makes data easier to access from multiple systems and locations
and easier to back up and archive.
</p><p>
As it happens, there's a rich toolkit available to Linux users for
building, securing and using file servers, mainly in the form of Jeremy
Allison and Andrew Tridgell's Samba suite of d&aelig;mons and commands, plus
various graphical tools that supplement them. For the next few columns,
I'm going to show you how to build a secure Samba file server using both
command-line and GUI tools.
</p><p>
Does that sound like a good Paranoid Penguin project? Good enough, I
hope, to forgive me for ignoring file servers for so long. (So
many things to secure, so little time!)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea2580.0xf9a778"></a>
What We Want to Achieve</h2></div></div><p>
Obviously, no series of articles can cover everyone's file server needs or
wants. So, before I begin, let's agree on some requirements of my choosing
(hopefully, some or all of these coincide with yours). It seems
reasonable to focus on the following:
security, convenience and cross-platform compatibility.
</p><p>
It goes without saying that in a security project, security is foremost
among my preoccupations. With a file server, I'm going to pay particular
attention to protecting the data itself: the integrity, availability
and confidentiality of my files, while at rest on the server and in
transit over the network. I also want to protect the server itself,
both to protect the data and to prevent the server from being misused
in other ways.
</p><p>
The trio of goals I listed above (confidentiality, integrity and
availability) is part of classic information security dogma. In just about
any information security scenario you can think of, C, I and A are
important one way or another.
</p><p>
The goal of simply preventing a system from being used in unexpected or
unwanted ways by unauthorized persons though, is what I like to call
exclusivity. If I go to the trouble of building and maintaining a file
server, even if the data itself is 100% boring and useless (please do
not insert a joke about Paranoid Penguin column archiving here), 
I want such a server to be used <span   class="emphasis"><em>exclusively</em></span> by me and the users
I specifically designate.
</p><p>
Even if it's some sort of public file server (for which, by the way,
asynchronous file transfer technologies, such as FTP, HTTP and rsync
are <span   class="emphasis"><em>much</em></span> more securable than Samba), I still want that server to
be used <span   class="emphasis"><em>exclusively</em></span> for that purpose. I don't want it being used
as someone's pirate IRC server, warez repository or proxy for attacking
other systems.
</p><p>
I just mentioned that the type of file server I'm talking about (the kind
to which you can &ldquo;map drives&rdquo;) isn't suitable for public file serving. This is
because the two dominant tools for this, Samba and NFS, historically
have relied on RPC, a protocol that involves the dynamic assigning of TCP and
UDP listening ports on a per-client, per-connection basis, which requires
a large range of ports to be opened through any firewalls that might be
in the way. Alas, opening UDP and TCP ports 1025 through 65,534 in both
directions through a firewall is an awful lot like not using a firewall
at all, even if you limit source or destination IP addresses.
</p><p>
On the one hand, more current versions of NFS (versions 3 and 4) allow the
server/d&aelig;mon to use a single TCP port for all connections by concurrent
users. However, much of the world seems to be stuck on NFS v2. Worse
still for our purposes here, there never has been good support for NFS
outside the world of UNIX and UNIX-like platforms.
</p><p>
And, this brings us to our other two requirements: convenience and
cross-platform compatibility. I want to be able to map network
drives/volumes, because this is much, much more convenient than manually
copying files to and from the file server every time one changes, even
automatically via some script. I want a file share that allows me to
&ldquo;work&rdquo; on files that &ldquo;reside&rdquo; in a central location; I don't want working
copies of my files being maintained on umpteen different systems.
</p><p>
I've alluded to the fact that NFS allows you to map network volumes in a
very similar way as with Samba. However, I have to acknowledge the ugly
reality that I am sometimes required to operate Windows systems. My job
requires it and so does my video-gaming habit. So, I need a file server
that supports both Linux and Windows clients. (As it happens, the one
we're going to build also will support FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Mac OS X
and practically the entire rest of the *nix world!)
</p><p>
To summarize, we're going to build our file server with Samba, because
it's convenient and it supports different client platforms. And, we're
going to build it as securely as possible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea2580.0xf9ae00"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Samba over the Internet?</b></p><p>
If Samba is so very convenient, you may wonder, why not use IPsec or
some other VPN/encryption tool to secure its use on the Internet? This is
actually possible. As it's been a while since I covered IPsec in this
space, and in the intervening years, IPsec support has been added to the
Linux kernel, I just may end this series with a quick tutorial on doing
Samba over IPsec.
</p><p>
However, Samba is a very &ldquo;chatty&rdquo; protocol&mdash;it generates a lot of packets
even if you're using it only for small files or shares. This causes
problems not so much for your Internet link as for Samba performance:
Samba can be very sensitive to dropped or delayed packets, which is
more likely in your modestly sized Internet uplink than over your
exponentially bigger Local Area Network (LAN) fabric.
</p><p>
So, trying to get Samba working over IPsec may or may not be worth
your time, and it may or may not warrant my covering it in this series of
columns. Have no fear, one way or another, you can expect me to provide
a tutorial on using the Linux kernel's IPsec functionality in a future
Paranoid Penguin column.

Samba Security Terms and Concepts</h2></div></div><p>
I've explained in gory detail why Samba, firewalls and the Internet
don't go well together. So, how do you secure Samba for LAN use?
</p><p>
Samba security is a surprisingly complex topic, which is why this is
a multipart article. You've got many choices to make if you want
to use Samba securely. Is your Samba server also going to be an NT
domain controller, or will it participate in an existing domain or
workgroup? Will you permit guest access, or will all users of every
share need to be authenticated first? Or, will you allow both private
and public shares?
</p><p>
Don't worry if the previous questions make little sense to you. That's
why the Paranoid Penguin is here. For most of the rest of this
article, I discuss these concepts in detail. Only then will you be
ready to explore the mysteries of smb.conf and the NMB d&aelig;mon.
</p><p>
First, let's get some definitions out of the way:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
SMB: the Server Message Block protocol, the heart of Samba. SMB
is the set of messages that structure and use file and print
shares.
</p></li><li><p>
CIFS: short for the Common Internet File System, which in practical terms is synonymous with SMB.
</p></li><li><p>
NetBIOS: the API used to pass SMB messages to lower-level network
protocols, such as TCP/IP.
</p></li><li><p>
NBT: the specification for using NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
</p></li><li><p>
WINS: Microsoft's protocol for resolving NBT hostnames to IP
addresses; it's the MS world's answer to DNS.
</p></li><li><p>
Workgroup: a peer-to-peer group of related systems offering SMB shares.
User accounts are decentralized&mdash;that is, maintained on all
member systems rather than on a single central server.
</p></li><li><p>
NT domain: a type of group consisting of computers, user accounts and 
other groups (but not other domains). It is more complex than 
a workgroup, but because all domain information is maintained on 
one or more domain controllers rather than being distributed 
across all domain members, domains scale much better than 
workgroups.
</p></li><li><p>
Active Directory: Microsoft's next-generation domain system. Samba can
serve as an Active Directory client via Kerberos, but you can't control an Active 
Directory tree with a Samba server as you presently can do with 
NT Domains. Active Directory server support will be introduced in Samba v4.
</p></li><li><p>
User-mode security: when a Samba server's shares are authenticated by local
workgroup user names and passwords.
</p></li><li><p>
Share-mode security: when each share on a Samba server is authenticated with a share-specific password that isn't explicitly associated with a user
name.
</p></li><li><p>
Guest access: when a Samba server allows anonymous connections to a given 
share via a shared guest account with no password.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Here's what you need to take away from that list of definitions. 
</p><p>
First, the protocols. SMB, aka CIFS, is the protocol that defines the
network filesystem&mdash;its structure and its use. NetBIOS provides an API
through which SMB messages may be transmitted over networks, and which may
be used by servers to &ldquo;advertise&rdquo; services and by clients to
&ldquo;browse&rdquo;
those services. NetBIOS can use any of a number of lower-level network
protocols as its transport, but the most important of these is TCP/P;
NetBIOS over TCP/IP is called NBT. WINS provides centralized name services
(mappings of hostnames to IP addresses), where needed.
</p><p>
Next, server roles. A Samba server can authenticate its transactions
either on a per-share basis, using share-specific passwords and
inferred/implicit user names, or on a per-user basis, using either
a dedicated local user database (in user-mode security) or some
networked authentication scheme, such as LDAP, NIS, NT Domains or Active
Directory. The server can be in a workgroup, in which case it needs to
maintain its own database of all the workgroup's user information, or
it can be in an NT Domain or an Active Directory, in which all user information
is managed centrally.
</p><p>
When you want to share data with maximum convenience and minimum security,
for example, read-only files containing nonsensitive data, you can put
it on a share with guest access. Users connecting to such a share will
not be prompted for any user name or password.
</p><p>
The bad news is that this is only a fraction of what you need to know
in order to understand SMB/Samba services. The good news is, NT
Domains and Active Directory are out of scope for this series of articles.
We're going to focus on using workgroups for our secure Samba file server.
</p><p>
Workgroups don't scale well, because each server in a workgroup needs
to maintain all user information for the entire workgroup, and you must
somehow keep this information (passwords and so forth) consistent across
all workgroup members (except where only guest access or share-mode
access is permitted).
</p><p>
However, for the usage scenario I've described&mdash;creating a file
share or two I can reach from anywhere in my house&mdash;I'm not going
to have very many users or even more than one server, necessarily, and
the simplicity of setting up a standalone/workgroup server trumps the
complexity-laden power that comes with NT Domains. If your needs differ,
hopefully this series of articles nonetheless will make it easier for
you to figure out Samba's NT Domain support on your own, if that's what
you really need instead.
</p><p>
So, to express our project in the terms I've just defined, in subsequent
articles, I'm going to walk through the process of configuring a
standalone (workgroup) Samba server operating with user-mode security,
using a dedicated local user database. Our example server will host a
combination of guest shares, read-only shares restricted by user and
shares that can be read by only some users, but that can be written to
(changed) by others.
</p><p>
First though, we have to make sure you've got the software you need in order
to pull that off.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xea2580.0x1394180"></a>
Getting Samba Software</h2></div></div><p>
On your Samba server, you're going to need your distribution's packages
for Samba's libraries; the Samba d&aelig;mons smbd, nmbd and winbindd;
the Samba client commands smbclient, smbmount and so forth (which are
useful even on servers for testing Samba configurations); and also the
Web-based configuration tool SWAT (Figure 1). Naturally, nearly all these
things are contained in packages whose names don't correspond neatly
with the names of their component d&aelig;mons, libraries and so forth, but I
give some pointers on those shortly.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10224f1.large.jpg"><img src="10224f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. SWAT
</p></div></div><p>
First, a word about SWAT, which requires a modest security trade-off
for Ubuntu users. Although normally in Ubuntu the user root can't log in
directly, Samba requires this to be possible, so you need to set a
root password on any Ubuntu box that runs SWAT.
</p><p>
Like so much else about Samba, this is not something I recommend doing
on any Internet-facing Ubuntu box. However, SWAT is such a useful
and educational tool, I feel pretty confident in stating that in
non-Internet-facing environments, the mistakes SWAT will help you avoid
probably constitute a bigger threat to system security than SWAT does.
</p><p>
As I mentioned, Samba packages are included in all major Linux
distributions. In Debian and its derivatives, such as Ubuntu, you'll
want to install the following deb packages: samba, samba-common,
samba-doc, smbclient and swat (plus whatever packages you need to satisfy
dependencies in any of these).
</p><p>
In SUSE, you'll want to install samba, samba-client, samba-winbind
and samba-doc. (SWAT is included with one of these, probably samba.)
</p><p>
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its derivatives, you need samba,
samba-client, samba-common and samba-swat.
</p><p>
Installing these binary packages should involve installation scripts that
put startup scripts, symbolic links and so forth in the correct places
for everything to work (at least, after you configure Samba to serve
something). Using SWAT is the best way to get up and running
quickly&mdash;not because it does very much work <span   class="emphasis"><em>for</em></span> you, but because its
excellent help system makes it super-convenient to summon the pertinent
parts of Samba's various man pages.
</p><p>
There are two SWAT quirks I should mention. First, SWAT must be run by
an Internet super-server, such as the old Berkeley inetd or the newer
xinetd. Ubuntu configures inetd automatically when you install the swat
package, but if your distribution of choice does not, you need a line
like this in /etc/inetd.conf:


<pre     class="programlisting">
swat   stream  tcp    nowait.400   root   /usr/sbin/tcpd  /usr/sbin/swat
</pre>
</p><p>
Second, to get SWAT's help links to work under SUSE 11.0, you may need
to create the following symbolic links while logged in to a terminal
window as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s /usr/share/doc/packages/samba/htmldocs/manpages 
 &#8618;/usr/share/samba/swat/help
ln -s /usr/share/doc/packages/samba/htmldocs/using_samba 
 &#8618;/usr/share/samba/swat/help
ln -s /usr/share/doc/packages/samba/htmldocs/index.html 
 &#8618;/usr/share/samba/swat/help
ln -s /usr/share/doc/packages/samba/htmldocs/manpages.html 
 &#8618;/usr/share/samba/swat/help
</pre>

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
And with that, we're ready to start configuring our Samba server! Or
we would be, if we weren't out of time and space for this month. The links in
the Resources section, not to mention SWAT's aforementioned excellent
help links, should help you get started before we continue this series
in my next column. Until then, be safe!
