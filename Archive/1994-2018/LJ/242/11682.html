In mobile we are losing the free world called the Web and the Net. How do
we save it?

Already most of us spend more time on mobile devices than we do on desktops
and laptops, put together. We also can do a lot more stuff, in a lot more
places, on mobile devices than on computers. There were more than a million
iOS apps on the shelves of Apple's store in October 2013
(<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/10/apples-app-store-hits-50-billion-downloads-paid-out-10-billion-to-developers" target="_self">techcrunch.com/2013/06/10/apples-app-store-hits-50-billion-downloads-paid-out-10-billion-to-developers</a>), and I'm guessing
there are at least that many Android apps on Google's shelves by now.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, app development on computers is slacking off&mdash;so is Web
development, except as required to accessorize mobile apps. And on mobile
devices, use of the Web is fading as well. According to Flurry Analytics
(<a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/109749/Apps-Solidify-Leadership-Six-Years-into-the-Mobile-Revolution" target="_self">blog.flurry.com/bid/109749/Apps-Solidify-Leadership-Six-Years-into-the-Mobile-Revolution</a>),
the Web's share of mobile use dropped from 20% in 2013 to 14% in 2014. In
&ldquo;The Decline of the Mobile Web&rdquo;
(<a href="http://cdixon.org/2014/04/07/the-decline-of-the-mobile-web" target="_self">cdixon.org/2014/04/07/the-decline-of-the-mobile-web</a>), Chris Dixon

This is a worrisome trend for the web. Mobile is the future. What wins
mobile, wins the Internet. Right now, apps are winning and the web is
losing.
</p><p>
Moreover, there are signs that it will only get worse. Ask any web company
and they will tell you that they value app users more than web users. This
is why you see so many popups and banners on mobile websites that try to
get you to download apps. It is also why so many mobile websites are
broken. Resources are going to app development over web development. As the
mobile web UX further deteriorates, the momentum toward apps will only
increase.
</p><p>
The likely end state is the web becomes a niche product used for things
like 1) trying a service before you download the app, 2) consuming long
tail content (e.g., link to a niche blog from Twitter or Facebook feed).
</p></blockquote></div><p>
He sees an end state that &ldquo;will probably be like cable TV&mdash;a few
dominant channels/apps that sit on users' home screens and everything
else relegated to lower tiers or irrelevance&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Those millions of apps are a forest of silos, growing on land that is
privately owned or controlled by Apple, Google and Microsoft. Out on the
streets, plains and hills of the civilized world, network connections are
also provided by mobile phone companies, whose own silos are walled by
usage limits and by tariffs at national borders.
</p><p>
Underneath it all, the Internet is getting harder and harder to see,
understand and appreciate. Already mobile operators in India are offering
free or cheaper plans just for Facebook, Whatsapp and Twitter
(<a href="http://www.medianama.com/2013/01/223-airtel-vodafone-idea-data-internet-rates-increase" target="_self">www.medianama.com/2013/01/223-airtel-vodafone-idea-data-internet-rates-increase</a>). To those
operators, network neutrality means nothing. In fact, it never did, to any
of the big operators. When he was Chief Scientist at BT, JP Rangaswami
(<a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com" target="_self">confusedofcalcutta.com</a>) said
the core competence of phone companies is billing, not communications.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Winning the Internet&rdquo; should be absurd on its face, like
&ldquo;winning&rdquo;
sunlight or weather. But it isn't in mobile, which already has turned into
a giant Truman Show (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show</a>). Inside that show, small app developers become suburbs
of large ones&mdash;for example, by requiring logins through Facebook or Twitter,
rather than using an identity from the open world, such as an e-mail
address. That's the case with Shazam (<a href="http://www.shazam.com" target="_self">www.shazam.com</a>), a handy mobile app you can use to
identify the music you hear. But if you want to see the music you've
&ldquo;tagged&rdquo; with Shazam on the company's Web site, the only way to log in is
through Facebook. As for getting that data back out, good luck.
</p><p>
Even apps that do let you have your data back also make the process costly
or difficult. Fitbit will give you XLS and CSV data, but only with a
&ldquo;premium&rdquo; subscription of $49.99/year. To get personal data gathered by
Nike+ devices and apps, you'll need an external hack, such as fuel_dump
(<a href="https://github.com/edrabbit/fuel_dump" target="_self">https://github.com/edrabbit/fuel_dump</a>).
Integrating that data is also a steep challenge. Some app developers will
partner with other companies or open their APIs to allow data to flow
between apps, but integrating personal data gathered by mobile apps on a
personal computer requires real wizardry. The Muggles won't bother.
</p><p>
There are exceptions though. My favorite is Moves (<a href="http://moves-app.com" target="_self">moves-app.com</a>), a $2.99 app from
Finland that produces an &ldquo;activity diary&rdquo; of your walking, running, cycling
and riding around in the world. Its Web site kindly provides data
exports in CSV, GEOSON, GEORSS, GPX, ICAL, JSONKML and KML_GE. Within those
are Activities, Places and Storyline. The only loophole in its otherwise
respectful privacy policy is one that lets your data go to a third party if
that party buys the company (<a href="http://www.moves-app.com/privacy" target="_self">www.moves-app.com/privacy</a>). Still, privacy laws are much stronger in
Europe than in most other places, especially the US.
</p><p>
Many ordinary activities that are open in the physical world are now silo'd
in the virtual one. Take reading books, for example. Buy a hardcover or
paperback book, and it's yours. You can pull it off your shelf and read it
without any company intermediating the process or telling you what you can
and can't do. This is not the case with most electronic books, which can
be read only on proprietary machines using proprietary software, both of
which are mostly Amazon's. My wife just got a new Kindle Fire, as a gift
from the airline she's flown for more than two million miles. It's a nice
gift, but using it feels like you're on an Amazon cruise ship with
portholes looking out to the open world.
</p><p>
Even listening to radio on-line is an ordeal compared to what we had when
stations could be found on radio dials. Although there are apps&mdash;TuneIn
(<a href="http://tunein.com" target="_self">tunein.com</a>) and
Wunderadio (<a href="http://www.wunderradio.com" target="_self">www.wunderradio.com</a>)&mdash;that try to replicate the dials of old (and it's not easy,
given the vast numbers of stations streaming in the world), station owners
feel the need to create an app for their own stations, or for fleets of
them, to the exclusion of others. This is what Clear Channel
(<a href="http://www.clearchannel.com/Pages/Home.aspx" target="_self">www.clearchannel.com/Pages/Home.aspx</a>) does with
iHeartRadio (<a href="http://www.iheart.com" target="_self">www.iheart.com</a>). It's a
&ldquo;dial&rdquo; mostly of its own stations. To it, as to
other large operators in the virtual world, the infrastructure that matters
isn't the public stuff that's open and ownerless&mdash;such as the Net, the
Web and e-mail&mdash;but what's private and controlled by companies with
which deals can be done.
</p><p>
For example, right now at the top of the stream of tweets I see on Twitter
is a &ldquo;promoted&rdquo; link&mdash;an ad&mdash;from Sprinklr. The
tweet says, &ldquo;FREE
eBook: Without Infrastructure, You Can't Be Social&rdquo;. The link goes to a
page about &ldquo;The Rise of Social Experience Management&rdquo;, explained in a free
eBook that requires giving up a bunch of personal data so you can become a
qualified lead for whatever it is that Sprinklr sells. Note that the
&ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; is theirs. Not the Net's. Not the Web's. Not any space we
all share. Just their space, which they own and charge rent to use.
</p><p>
Nowhere is mobile infrastructure more locked down and controlled than with
the app stores. These completely private marketplaces are monopolies to
mobile customers and monopsonies to app companies. As sole
intermediaries,
the stores get to charge what they want, which is a lot. Apple and Google
both take 30% of what you pay for an app. So does Microsoft, but it drops its
cut to 20% after sales of an app reach $25k. These are monopoly rents. Ask
your shoe or grocery store what kind of margins it gets&mdash;or hell, even
Amazon.
</p><p>
I believe the only answer is to equip ordinary individuals (Muggles, not
just wizards like us) with independent tools for integrating and managing
data and services&mdash;and better ways to exercise their autonomy,
independence, freedom and agency in the world. I don't see any other way to
break out of the Matrix (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix</a>) that the mobile world is becoming.
</p><p>
We need to start with general-purpose devices on which we can run anything
we want. We still have that with some computers, but we don't with our
mobile devices. There, with no meaningful exceptions, we are still vassals
of Apple, Google and Microsoft.
</p><p>
Fortunately, Android is a breed of Linux. In the Matrix of mobile, Linux is
Zion.

Wake up, Neo.
