Monitor your network's security 24/7 with a free and open-source solution
that collects, analyzes and reports logs of the events on your network.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297e580.0x2a761f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Networks and information systems are increasingly exposed to attacks
that are becoming more sophisticated and sustained over time,
such as the so-called APT (Advanced Persistent Threats).
</p><p>
Information security experts agree on the fact that no organization,
even the best equipped to protect itself from these attacks, can be
considered immune, and that the issue is not whether its systems will be
compromised, but rather when and how it will happen.
</p><p>
It is essential to be able to detect attacks in a timely
manner and implement the relative countermeasures,
following appropriate procedures to respond to incidents, thus minimizing the effects and the damages they can cause.
In order to detect intrusions and attacks, system administrators and
information security analysts make use of tools, such as IDS/IPS
(Intrusion Detection/Prevention System) and analysis of logs (event
records) of servers and network devices, looking for any significant
events from a security point of view.
</p><p>
A network of an organization of average size produces, as a whole, such
a quantity of logs that it is very difficult (and still very expensive)
to check them all, one by one, to obtain meaningful information.
</p><p>
A further difficulty is that there is no single standard used to record
the logs and often, depending on the type and size, they are not immediate
or easy to understand.
</p><p>
It is even more difficult to relate other logs produced
by many different systems to each other manually, to highlight anomalies in the network that
would not be detectable by analyzing the logs of each machine
separately.
</p><p>
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) software, therefore, is not limited to being a centralized solution for
log management, but also (and especially) it has the ability to standardize
logs in a single format, analyze the recorded events, highlight the
most important information and relate the logs to each other (correlation),
allowing analysts to detect anomalies and attacks more easily.
</p><p>
For example, for log management software, three failed attempts to
log in to the same user account from three different clients will 
be only three lines in your log file and not obviously related to each
other. For an analyst, instead, it may be a sequence of events worthy
of further analysis, and its correlation (looking for patterns in the
log files) can generate alerts when these types of events occur.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297e580.0x2a76618"></a>
Overview of a SIEM Open-Source Solution: OSSIM</h2></div></div><p>
OSSIM is a SIEM software
platform, free and open-source, developed by AlienVault and based on a
Debian 64-bit Linux distribution.
OSSIM has four major components:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Sensor.
</p></li><li><p>
Server.
</p></li><li><p>
Framework.
</p></li><li><p>
Database.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
You can install these components on a single physical machine (the default
installation), on a single virtual machine, on different virtual machines
and/or physical machines, depending on the size and configuration
of the network to monitor.
</p><p>
For a relatively small network, installation on a single machine,
which is the simplest configuration, may be the right solution. For
larger networks, it is advisable to install the Sensor and the Database
separately.
Figure 1 shows the OSSIM architecture.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11676f1.large.jpg"><img src="11676f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. OSSIM Architecture
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sensor:</b></span>
</p><p>
The Sensor has two main components:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The rsyslog service, which listens on TCP/UDP port 514, receives the
logs from network devices and stores them locally, according to the
configuration.
</p></li><li><p>
The Ossim-agent, using a series of modules called plugins, one for each
type of log, performs log analysis and normalization, and sends that to the
Server component.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Plugins are of two types: detectors, which detect anomalies and possible
attacks (such as Snort, P0f, Arpwatch), and monitors to monitor the
network status (like Ntop and Nagios).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Server:</b></span>
</p><p>
The Server performs the essential SIEM functions: aggregation, risk assessment and
correlation of events that are received from the sensor through TCP
port 40001. The server also sends the information concerning the events
to the Database for storage.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Framework:</b></span>
</p><p>
The Framework connects and manages the OSSIM components and security tools included, and
it provides the system administration Web interface. It is the component
that needs the least hardware resources and is usually installed together
with the Server component.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Database:</b></span>
</p><p>
The Database is a MySQL server instance that stores events and system configuration
data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297e580.0x2a772d0"></a>
Functionalities</h2></div></div><p>
Following is a brief description of OSSIM's main features and functionalities
concerning the collection, analysis and correlation of logs and the
primary tools included in the system for network security monitoring.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Collection and Normalization of Logs:</b></span>
</p><p>
You can collect logs from the devices on your network in two ways:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Install a software agent (like Snare or SysLogAgent) in the source machine
and configure it to read certain types of logs and send them to the
Sensor component.
</p></li><li><p>
Configure the source machine to send the logs upon request of the
appropriate Sensor plugins (for example, via WMI for Windows machines). Once
the Sensor records the logs, the OSSIM Agent performs the analysis and
converts them to a single format (normalization). Each log represents an
event that will be sent to the server for analysis (Figure 2).
</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11676f2.large.jpg"><img src="11676f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Log Collection and Normalization
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Prioritization of Events and Risk
Assessment:</b></span>
</p><p>
The prioritization process involves assigning priority values to
the recorded events, which is done by the Server component. It depends
on the structure of the network and it needs, as prerequisites, the
definition of security policies and the inventory of information assets
on the network, which can be managed in the Web administration panel. It
sets the priority of an event based on the machine that generated it
and the type of event to which it belongs.
</p><p>
The risk assessment of events is calculated in real time and is based
on three main factors:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The value or level of importance of the machine that generated the event.
</p></li><li><p>
The type of threat posed by the event.
</p></li><li><p>
The probability that this event occurs.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The formula used for calculating risk is the following (Figure 3):
Risk = value * (reliability * Priority / 25).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11676f3.large.jpg"><img src="11676f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. How to Calculate the Risk Associated with an Event
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Analysis and Correlation of Events:</b></span>
</p><p>
The correlation of events essentially relates events to each other to
achieve a comprehensive view of network security and to detect possible
attacks or anomalies.
</p><p>
The correlation process is performed via two methods:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Correlation using sequence of events, using directives, consisting of
rules that relate events to patterns of known attacks. This method
is similar to using Snort for intrusion detection (signature-based
detection).
</p></li><li><p>
Correlation using heuristic algorithms can be detected by these abnormal
situations that do not detect the preceding rules and may or may not
be attacks (abnormality detection).
</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11676f4.large.jpg"><img src="11676f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Example of Analysis and Correlation of Events
</p></div></div><p>
Directives are located in the /etc/ossim/server/directives.xml file.
Directives are specified in XML using tags like Id, Name, Priority,
Type, Reliability, Occurrence, Timeout, Source, Destination, Source port,
destination port, protocol, PluginSid and Sensor.
</p><p>
Reliability is a measure of the probability that the considered event
truly represents the attack referred to by the directive and is generally
based on the number of occurrences of the event.
</p><p>
For example, consider the following directive to detect brute-force
SSH attacks:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;directive id="20" name="Possible SSH brute force login  
 &#8618;attempt against DST_IP" priority="5"&gt;
&lt;rule type="detector" name="SSH Authentication failure" 
 &#8618;reliability="3" occurrence="1" from="ANY" to="ANY" 
 &#8618;port_from="ANY" port_to="ANY" time_out="10" 
 &#8618;plugin_id="4003" plugin_sid="1,2,3,4,5,6"&gt;
&lt;rules&gt;
&lt;rule type="detector" name="SSH Authentication failure (3 times)"
 &#8618;reliability="+1" occurrence="3" from="1:SRC_IP" to="ANY"
 &#8618;port_from="ANY" time_out="15" port_to="ANY"
 &#8618;plugin_id="4003" plugin_sid="1,2,3,4,5,6" sticky="true"&gt;
&lt;rules&gt;
&lt;rule type="detector" name="SSH Authentication failure (5 times)"
 &#8618;reliability="+2" occurrence="5" from="1:SRC_IP" to="ANY"
 &#8618;port_from="ANY" time_out="20" port_to="ANY"
 &#8618;plugin_id="4003" plugin_sid="1,2,3,4,5,6" sticky="true"&gt;
&lt;rules&gt;
&lt;rule type="detector" name="SSH Authentication failure (10 times)"
 &#8618;reliability="+2" occurrence="10" from="1:SRC_IP" to="ANY"
 &#8618;port_from="ANY" time_out="30" port_to="ANY"
 &#8618;plugin_id="4003" plugin_sid="1,2,3,4,5,6" sticky="true"&gt;
&lt;/rule&gt;
&lt;/rules&gt;
&lt;/rule&gt;
&lt;/rules&gt;
&lt;/rule&gt;
&lt;/rules&gt;
&lt;/rule&gt;
&lt;/directive&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
The directive assigns a value of reliability equal to 3 (30% probability)
when the number of occurrences of the event detected by the sensor
(SSH authentication error) is equal to 1, then increments it by 1 at
the third occurrence of the event, by 2 at the fifth occurrence and by
an additional 2 at the tenth, thereby achieving a reliability of 8 (80%
of probability) when the incorrect authentication attempts are 10.
</p><p>
OSSIM also has the ability to correlate different types of logs, generated
by various plugins (cross-correlation). The cross-correlation allows
you to change the event reliability and risk assessment.
For example, suppose that Nessus or OpenVAS has identified a
vulnerability in a server. If Snort detects an event that indicates a
possible attack on that server, the correlation engine increases the
level of risk associated with the event.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Generation of Alarms and Response Actions:</b></span>
</p><p>
The directives can create alarms, which either are generated by a single
event or by a specific sequence of events under certain conditions.
The alarms can be displayed in the Web administration panel, under the
menu item Incidents&rarr;Alarms.
</p><p>
Furthermore, alarms can activate response actions, such as sending
an alert by e-mail to the system administrator and/or the execution of
appropriate scripts.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Vulnerability Analysis, Intrusion Detection and Network
Monitoring:</b></span>
</p><p>
OSSIM includes many valuable tools, which also are open-source, that are
among the most known and used for intrusion detection, vulnerability
analysis and network management and monitoring:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Arpwatch: used for monitoring ARP traffic on the LAN and for related
attack detection.
</p></li><li><p>
P0f: used for operating system identification and analysis.
</p></li><li><p>
Pads: used for detecting anomalies of the services running on
a host.
</p></li><li><p>
Nessus and OpenVAS: the most widely used and popular vulnerability
scanners.
</p></li><li><p>
Nmap: the most famous and powerful network scanner.
</p></li><li><p>
Snort: the most popular intrusion detection system (IDS).
</p></li><li><p>
Tcptrack: used for TCP connection monitoring.
</p></li><li><p>
Nagios and Ntop: used to monitor the status of the network, the hosts
and the availability of services.
</p></li><li><p>
Osiris and OSSEC: intrusion detection software for individual hosts
(HIDS&mdash;Host-Based IDS).
</p></li><li><p>
Snare: a software agent for collecting logs on Windows systems.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297e580.0x2a6f840"></a>
Installation and Hardware Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
You can download the ISO file for the installation from the AlienVault
Web site download page at <a href="http://www.alienvault.com/free-downloads-services" target="_self">www.alienvault.com/free-downloads-services</a>.
</p><p>
The most recent version (February 2014) is 4.3.4, only for 64-bit
architectures. You can choose the Automatic or Custom installation. The
automatic installation is fairly simple, in graphical mode by default,
and it installs all components of OSSIM on the same machine.
The custom installation allows you to select the mode (graphical or
textual) and which components to install.
The custom installation is a little more complex because it has more configuration options.
For instructions on how to install OSSIM, refer to the Installation Guide:
<a href="https://alienvault.bloomfire.com/posts/525575-installation-guide/public" target="_self">https://alienvault.bloomfire.com/posts/525575-installation-guide/public</a>.
</p><p>
The minimum hardware requirements are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
64-bit processor or virtualization software with support for 64-bit
operating systems (at least a quad-core processor is recommended).
</p></li><li><p>
4GB of RAM.
</p></li><li><p>
500GB of free disk space.
</p></li><li><p>
Network adapter with support for the Intel e1000 Ethernet driver.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Of course, the hardware requirements will be directly proportional to
the size of the network (number of hosts and network devices connected)
and consequently to the amount of logs produced and recorded.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297e580.0x2a6fe18"></a>
Configuration and Management</h2></div></div><p>
You can perform the system configuration and administration through
the console, a Linux shell or through a more convenient and intuitive
Web interface.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Configuration through the Console:</b></span>
</p><p>
To configure the system through the console, you need to log in as root
with the password you set during the installation process.
The directory that contains the system's configuration files is
/etc/ossim.
</p><p>
The main configuration file is /etc/ossim/ossim_setup.conf, which contains
the system's main settings, such as IP addresses and ports of the hosts
on which components are installed, the active plugins and the password
used by the root user of MySQL, randomly generated by the system during
the installation procedure.
</p><p>
For example, if you want to change your password or other data, you need
to edit the file with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# vi /etc/ossim/ossim_setup.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
Then run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ossim-reconfig
</pre>
</p><p>
To change the main configuration file more easily, there is also a
command called <tt  >ossim_setup</tt>, which presents a graphical interface, shown
in Figure 5.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11676f5.large.jpg"><img src="11676f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Configuration with the ossim_setup Tool
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Configuring the Sensor and Plugins:</b></span>
</p><p>
With the <tt  >ossim_setup</tt> command, you can set the parameters of the previously
shown configuration file, such as enabling or disabling plugins. To get a
list of plugins that can be turned on or off, select the option Change
sensor settings&rarr;Select detector plugins (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11676f6.large.jpg"><img src="11676f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. List of Plugins in ossim_setup
</p></div></div><p>
The OSSIM agent runs as a background service (d&aelig;mon), and you can 
start it with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#  /etc/init.d/ossim-agent start
</pre>
</p><p>
Its configuration file is /etc/ossim/agent/config.cfg.
The plugins' configuration files also are text files with the .cfg
extension and are in the /etc/ossim/agent/plugins/ directory.
When you activate new plugins, you must restart the server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#  /etc/init.d/ossim-server restart
</pre>
</p><p>
More than 2,000 plugins are available (<a href="http://www.alienvault.com/docs/AlienVault%20Plugin%20List%20-%20June-20-2010.pdf" target="_self">www.alienvault.com/docs/AlienVault%20Plugin%20List%20-%20June-20-2010.pdf</a>),
which you can download and
install via the Plugin Wizard. For example, run the following
commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /usr/share/ossim/scripts ; 
# plugin_wizard.pl -s "oracle"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297e580.0x2fff908"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you will get the plugins that contain the word &ldquo;Oracle&rdquo; in
the name.
</p><p>
With the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#  ./plugin_wizard.pl -g -s "oracle"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297e580.0x2fffb18"></a></h2></div></div><p>
these plugins will be extracted to a directory called win_plugins. 
</p><p>
Next,
you have to move them to the default directory /etc/ossim/agent/plugins/:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#  mv win_plugins/*.cfg  /etc/ossim/agent/plugins/
</pre>
</p><p>
Files with the .sql extension must be added to the MySQL database with the
following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# ossim-db &lt; ./win_plugins/*.sql

</pre>
</p><p>
If the database server is not installed on the same machine, you need to
copy the files on the server:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# scp win_plugins/*.sql root@&lt;IP Database&gt;:/root/

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297e580.0x2fffe30"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and run the <tt  >ossim-db</tt> command from the database server.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Server Configuration:</b></span>
</p><p>
The configuration directory for the Server component is /etc/ossim/server.
The main file is directives.xml, which specifies the configuration file
directives, grouped by type of attack, such as malware, brute force and so on.
</p><p>
When you create new guidelines, they should be specified in user.xml
rather than in the file containing the default directives (Figure 7).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11676f7.large.jpg"><img src="11676f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. New Directives Specified in the user.xml File
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>rsyslog's D&aelig;mon Configuration and Log
Rotation:</b></span>
</p><p>
The /var/log/ossim directory contains the log files of OSSIM's components.
The d&aelig;mon that keeps track of the logs is, as already mentioned,
rsyslog, whose configuration file is /etc/rsyslog.conf.
</p><p>
During the installation process, you configure rsyslog to accept logs
from remote machines and store them in different log files, depending
on the type and the host that created them.
</p><p>
To achieve this, rsyslog uses filters based on expressions, which are
.conf files usually placed in the /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory.
For example, to save the logs from a Fortinet firewall in the file
/var/log/ossim/fortinet.log, the expression would be:


<pre     class="programlisting">
if ($source == '192.168.1.100' and $msg contains 'fortinet ') 
 &#8618;and $severity &lt;= '6' then /var/log/ossim/fortinet.log
</pre>
</p><p>
Adding new hosts that send the logs to rsyslog, you quickly can run out
of disk space. Therefore, it is important to define a policy for log
rotation in /etc/logrotate.conf. This involves the regular archiving,
at predefined intervals, of the existing log files. After a predefined
period, the archived log files are deleted or stored on external devices
for backup.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Administration through the Web Interface:</b></span>
</p><p>
OSSIM also can be configured and managed through a nice Web interface,
connecting with the browser to the IP address of the machine on which
you installed the Server/Framework component (Figure 8).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11676f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Web Administration Interface Login Screen
</p></div></div><p>
The default user and password are admin/admin. When you log in for the
first time, you are prompted to change your password.
</p><p>
Through the Web interface, you can perform the following tasks:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
System configuration (users, update, backups and so on).
</p></li><li><p>
Creation and configuration of directives, policies and actions.
</p></li><li><p>
Real-time monitoring of network security.
</p></li><li><p>
Report generation.
</p></li><li><p>
Ticketing system.
</p></li><li><p>
Vulnerability management and incident response.
</p></li><li><p>
Management and optimization of network traffic.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The Web interface includes several sections:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Dashboard: provides an overview of detected security events. Displays
the visual counters and statistics of the most important security
events (Figure 9).
</p></li><li><p>
Incidents: shows the list of security events and generated alarms with
specific information, such as date, priority, risk, status and a brief
history of the actions taken by system administrators.
</p></li><li><p>
Analysis: shows a table with the latest events detected, the type, date,
origin, destination, the OSSIM node that detected it and the risk. From
here, the user can search for patterns in the events according to
different criteria (for example, the source IP address). This includes
a real-time list of detected events that is updated every two seconds.
</p></li><li><p>
Report: allows you to generate reports about security events and network
status.
</p></li><li><p>
Activities: this interface allows you to run and manage network inventory,
identify and add new machines from which to record the logs.
</p></li><li><p>
Intelligence: this section handles the system logic&mdash;definition and
management of policies/actions, directives, event correlation and

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
OSSIM is a viable open-source SIEM solution and a free alternative to
other commercial SIEM products (including AlienVault USM, the commercial
version of OSSIM), which are much more expensive, and it is supported
by a community of developers and users through forums and documentation
available on the AlienVault's Web site.
