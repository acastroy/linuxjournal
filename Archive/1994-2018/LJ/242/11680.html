Get to know the language and tools that can take your network filtering
rules to a
whole new level.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1272580.0x136a1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Network filtering is probably as old as networks themselves. If you
exchange data with the outside world, it's natural to control what's going
in and out. If, however, you capture packets for a good reason (like
traffic analysis or intrusion detection), filtering those you are not
interested in as early as possible is crucial for performance. The
first type of filtering is typically done with a firewall. Berkeley
Packet Filter (BPF) is what comes to the rescue in the second case.
</p><p>
Originally, BPF referred to both the capturing technology and its
high-performance filtering capabilities. For some Unices (for instance,
FreeBSD), this still holds true, and there is a /dev/bpf device from which you
can read captured packets. For others, BPF means what it says (the
filter), and in this reincarnation, you can find it in various operating
systems, including Linux, and with WinPcap and even Microsoft Windows.
</p><p>
BPF filters are programs written in a low-level language similar to
assembler (I take a look at that in the last section of this article). These programs
are executed by a BPF virtual machine. Most often, this virtual machine
resides in the kernel and uses Just-In-Time compilation (JIT) to boost
filtering performance. However, user-mode BPF interpreters (useful for
debugging purposes or as fallbacks) are available as well&mdash;for instance,
the one provided with the ubiquitous libpcap library (<a href="http://www.tcpdump.org" target="_self">www.tcpdump.org</a>), the
main workhorse behind tcpdump, Wireshark and other popular network tools.
</p><p>
All of this may sound like you need to delve into registers and
opcodes just to say you are interested in the packets coming to host
192.168.1.1. Luckily, that's not the case. Of course, if you want (or need)
to, you can, but libpcap provides its own high-level filter language
that compiles directly to BPF. Largely, this syntax is synonymous with BPF
(they are tightly related albeit different things), so I use these
terms interchangeably here.
</p><p>
In this article, you'll learn the basics of BPF syntax and also see
how it works under the hood.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1272580.0x136a5c0"></a>
The Testbed</h2></div></div><p>
To get a better idea of what BPF really is, let's go through a set of
examples, generating series of packets each time and filtering them as
as needed. Sometimes these packets will come from a real network
application, but other times you will craft them manually. It's not the best
idea to allow these forged packets out from the local host, especially
if you are on the office network. So the first step will be to create
a virtual Ethernet interface.
</p><p>
Linux already has a concept of &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; network interfaces, and the kernel
module named dummy implements them. Load it, and assign the dummy0
interface a unique IP address:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# modprobe dummy
# ip link set up dev dummy0
# ip addr add 192.168.2.1/24 dev dummy0
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you'll need something to craft the packets and capture them subject
to BPF filters. An obvious choice here is Scapy
(<a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy" target="_self">www.secdev.org/projects/scapy</a>), a Python
toolkit for packet manipulation. Install it with your package manager
or from the sources. Raw packet generation and live traffic capture
are considered privileged operations in Linux, so you'll need to run
Scapy as root (for example, with sudo).
</p><p>
Scapy provides an interactive shell (which is naturally Python-based). You
create different protocol layers as instances of the classes like TCP,
IP or Ether. A complete list is available with the <tt  >ls()</tt> command, and you
can add your own protocol if you really want to. The attributes of these
classes correspond to protocol fields (addresses, ports, flags and so
on). You can use raw numbers (say, 20) or symbolic names
(<tt  >ftp_data</tt>)
for attribute values. To assemble the packet, use the / Python operator:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ether(src='08:60:6e:da:31:ae', dst='42:7f:79:88:de:3d') / 
 &#8618;IP(src='192.168.1.5', dst='192.168.2.1')
&lt;Ether  dst=42:7f:79:88:de:3d src=08:60:6e:da:31:ae type=IPv4 
 &#8618;|&lt;IP  src=192.168.1.5 dst=192.168.2.1 |&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Protocol fields usually have sensible default values (you can check
them with <tt  >ls(IP)</tt> or similar), so you need to specify
only those you want
to override.
</p><p>
To disassemble the packet and get a specific protocol layer, use the []
operator:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; _[IP]
&lt;IP  src=192.168.1.5 dst=192.168.2.1 |&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
A special _ variable contains the last expression's value. Scapy makes
it easy to generate a series of packets that follow a specific pattern:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; packets = Ether(src='08:60:6e:da:31:ae', 
 &#8618;dst='42:7f:79:88:de:3d') / IP(src='192.168.1.5', 
 &#8618;dst='192.168.2.1-3') / UDP(dport=[135,(137,139)])
&gt;&gt;&gt; len(list(packets))
12
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, Scapy crafts 12 packets targeting UDP ports 135, 137, 138
and 139 (common Windows stuff) on three hosts. You can define address
ranges with an asterisk (<tt  >dst='192.168.*.2'</tt>), or whole subnets with CIDR
notation (<tt  >dst='192.168.2.0/24'</tt>).
</p><p>
Several functions send packets over the wire, but here,
let's deal with <tt  >send()</tt> and
<tt  >sendp()</tt>. The main difference is that
<tt  >sendp()</tt>
works on Layer 2, so the packet you pass it must have an Ethernet
header. <tt  >send()</tt> is for Layer 3, and it looks up the host's routing table
to decide what to do with the packet you gave it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; sendp(packets, iface='dummy0')
............
Sent 12 packets.
</pre>
</p><p>
This way, you push crafted packets into the dummy0 interface.
</p><p>
To capture packets, use the <tt  >sniff()</tt> function. It has many different options,
but on these pages, you'll mainly call it like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; sniff(iface='dummy0', filter='udp')
^C&lt;Sniffed: TCP:0 UDP:12 ICMP:0 Other:0&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; _.summary()
Ether / IP / UDP 192.168.1.5:domain &gt; 192.168.2.1:epmap
Ether / IP / UDP 192.168.1.5:domain &gt; 192.168.2.1:netbios_ns
... 10 lines skipped ...
</pre>
</p><p>
If you omit the <tt  >iface=</tt>, Scapy will listen on all network interfaces. You
also can add the <tt  >count=</tt> argument to capture only as many packets as specified;
otherwise, you should stop the capture manually with Ctrl-C. Without the
<tt  >filter=</tt>, <tt  >sniff()</tt> captures all packets. Internally, Scapy uses libpcap
to compile the filter (either directly or via the <tt  >tcpdump
-ddd</tt> command),
so the syntax is just what you want.
</p><p>
This was a quick tour of Scapy; however, this tool can do much more than
you've seen so far. Consult the official documentation
(<a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc" target="_self">www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc</a>) for more
information. 
Or, have a look at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Security Power Tools</em></span> published by O'Reilly
(2007), which has a complete chapter (number 6) on Scapy written by its
author, Philippe Biondi.

Some Scapy Tips</b></p><p>
You easily can convert between symbolic names and their numeric values
using the s2i and i2s attributes defined on the protocol fields. Both are
dictionaries, which you can use to look up the mapping:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; TCP.sport.s2i['www'], TCP.sport.i2s[21]
(80, 'ftp')
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that I've used a class attribute here (not the instance one):

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; TCP().sport
20
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the default value for the TCP source port in Scapy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; ls(TCP)
sport      : ShortEnumField       = (20)
...
</pre>
</p><p>
Many network protocol fields also accept bit flags. Scapy allows single letter
mnemonics for them:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; TCP().flags= 'S' # TCP SYN packet
</pre>
</p><p>
Available mnemonics are in the field's &ldquo;names&rdquo; attribute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; TCP.flags.names
'FSRPAUEC'
</pre>

Let's Filter</h2></div></div><p>
Now with the tools to experiment with in place, it's time to learn some
actual high-level BPF. The most authoritative (and complete) reference
documentation is the tcpdump(1) man page. Let's do a quick summary:
filter expressions contain one or more primitives combined with the
&ldquo;and&rdquo;,
&ldquo;or&rdquo; and &ldquo;not&rdquo; keywords (equivalently written as
&amp;&amp;, || and !). All basic
arithmetic and bit operations are supported as well, and the explicit
precedence can be set using parentheses. If you omit parentheses,
&amp;&amp;
and || are of the same precedence, and ! is applied first. Arithmetic
and bit operations follow common rules.
</p><p>
Each primitive consists of the ID (either name or number) preceded
with an optional protocol (<tt  >ether</tt>,
<tt  >ip</tt>,
<tt  >tcp</tt> or <tt  >udp</tt>, to name a few),
direction (<tt  >src</tt>, <tt  >dst</tt>,
<tt  >src or
dst</tt>, and <tt  >src and dst</tt>; it is always a
single token, so <tt  >or</tt> and <tt  >and</tt> aren't operators)
and type (<tt  >host</tt>, <tt  >net</tt>,
<tt  >port</tt> or <tt  >portrange</tt>). If some of these are
missing, all protocols match;
<tt  >host</tt> is assumed for the type, and <tt  >src or
dst</tt> for the direction (this
means either direction is okay). 
</p><p>
The following are valid primitives:
<tt  >udp</tt> (no ID here), <tt  >port 80</tt>
(TCP or UDP port 80), <tt  >ip host pluto</tt>
(all IP packets for the host &ldquo;pluto&rdquo;; the name must be resolvable),
<tt  >dst tcp portrange 0-1023</tt> (packets targeting all privileged TCP ports).
</p><p>
That's enough theory&mdash;now let's play. Arguably the most common case
is to filter packets by their source or destination IP addresses. Let's
use one Scapy instance to generate empty IP datagrams for random (and even
nonexistent) hosts:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; while True: sendp(Ether(src=RandMAC(), dst=RandMAC()) / 
 &#8618;IP(src=RandIP(), dst=RandIP()) / ICMP(), iface='dummy0')
</pre>
</p><p>
There are many <tt  >Rand*()</tt> functions in Scapy; two of
them are used here.
</p><p>
A second Scapy instance will capture the datagrams that happen to be for
host 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.1.2 (note that for the second operand
in the expression, the <tt  >host</tt> keyword is implicit):

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; sniff(iface='dummy0', filter='host 192.168.1.1 or 
 &#8618;192.168.1.2', count=1)
</pre>
</p><p>
Unless you are very lucky, <tt  >sniff()</tt> will hang until you press
Ctrl-C. That's because the probability for a given two addresses to occur
in a randomly generated packet series is around 0.0000001%. Let's increase
your chances and look for a whole A-class subnet:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; sniff(iface='dummy0', filter='net 1.0.0.0/8', count=1)
</pre>
</p><p>
Equivalently, you can rewrite the filter as <tt  >net 1.0.0.0 mask
255.0.0.0</tt>. This time, <tt  >sniff()</tt> should
catch a packet much sooner: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; _.summary()
Ether / 185.0.19.206 &gt; 1.205.135.116 hopopt
</pre>
</p><p>
It's equally easy to filter traffic on ports. For instance, this is a
very simple filter for MySQL client-server sessions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; sniff(iface='lo', filter='tcp port 3306')
</pre>
</p><p>
Try to connect to the MySQL server with the <tt  >mysql -h 127.0.0.1
-P 3306</tt> command,
and you'll see some packets captured. It doesn't matter if the server
is actually running&mdash;if it doesn't, you'll catch a pair of TCP SYN and
RST-ACK indicating the port is unavailable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; _.summary()
Ether / IP / TCP 127.0.0.1:57485 &gt; 127.0.0.1:mysql S
Ether / IP / TCP 127.0.0.1:mysql &gt; 127.0.0.1:57485 RA
</pre>
</p><p>
Detecting services by the port numbers they use isn't really accurate. Let's
do a deeper packet analysis. Imagine you need to collect data pertaining
to NTP activity on the local network. NTP messages are sent to (or from,
or both) UDP port 123. Moreover, they are 48 bytes in size and have
the status of a local clock, which can't be greater than 4, encoded in
bits 2&ndash;7 of the first octet (see Appendix B in RFC 958 at
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc958" target="_self">tools.ietf.org/html/rfc958</a>). Given
all of that, the filter you construct will consist of three primitives:
<tt  >udp port 123</tt> (for the first two conditions), and the other two checking
the UDP payload length and the clock status value.
</p><p>
To implement them, let's peek inside a protocol payload. BPF uses the
<tt  >[offset:size]</tt> operator for this purpose. Offset is measured from 
byte 0, so for instance, <tt  >tcp[0]</tt> gives the first byte of the TCP header
(not a payload). The UDP datagram Length field is at offset 4 and is 16 bits
wide. Thus, to check the packet length, you can use the following primitive:
<tt  >udp[4:2] == 48+8</tt> (UDP header length 8 is bytes, and they are included
in the Length field as well). The clock status check is a bit more convoluted,
but the combined filter looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; ntp = sniff(filter='proto udp and port 123 
 &#8618;and udp[4:2] == 48+8 and ((udp[8] &amp; 0x38) &gt;&gt; 3) &lt;= 4')
</pre>
</p><p>
Note the operators and hex numbers used&mdash;BPF is much like C in
this sense. Leave this alone for some minutes, and on a modern Linux
distribution you'll sooner or later spot the NTP requests the system sends
(and the replies it receives):


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt; ntp.summary()
Ether / IP / UDP / NTP v4, client
Ether / IP / UDP / NTP v4, server
...
&gt;&gt; ntp[0][NTP]
&lt;NTP  leap=nowarning version=4L mode=client stratum=2L 
 &#8618;poll=10L precision=233L delay=0.0422210693359 
 &#8618;dispersion=0.0782623291016 id=194.190.168.1 ref=Tue, 
 &#8618;15 Apr 2014 10:00:26 +0000 orig=Tue, 15 Apr 2014 
 &#8618;10:15:20 +0000 recv=Tue, 15 Apr 2014 10:15:20 
 &#8618;+0000 sent=Tue, 15 Apr 2014 10:33:04 +0000 |&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
In fact, it works so well, you even can drop the <tt  >udp proto
123</tt> part without
introducing too much error (my quick tests show about a 1% rate).
</p><p>
Another way to get the packet length is to use the
<tt  >len</tt> operator. However,
it accounts for all protocols used down to Layer 2. So, assuming UDP
datagrams are encapsulated in IPv4 with no options and untagged Ethernet
frames, you can rewrite <tt  >udp[4:2] == 48+8</tt> as
<tt  >len == 14+20+8+48</tt>. By
the way, you also can select packets longer (or shorter) than a specific
threshold with the <tt  >greater</tt> and
<tt  >less</tt> keywords.
</p><p>
Now you've seen that Scapy can decode (and encode) some application-level
protocols like NTP (or DNS). But it can dig even deeper, so for the next
example, let's use it to forge VLAN-tagged traffic:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; sendp(Ether(src=RandMAC(), dst=RandMAC()) / 
 &#8618;Dot1Q(vlan=[(1,5)]) / 'Nothing to see here', iface='dummy0')
</pre>
</p><p>
This generates five 802.1Q Ethernet frames with arbitrary MAC addresses
and VLAN tags in range 1&ndash;5 (note the syntax). Let's not worry about
the payload now, so instead of IPv4 (or any other network-level)
packet, let's just put raw bytes that form a <tt  >'Nothing to see
here'</tt> string
inside the frame.
</p><p>
This is how you can filter traffic with specific VLAN tags in BPF:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt;&gt;&gt; sniff(iface='dummy0', filter='vlan 1', count=1)
&lt;Sniffed: TCP:0 UDP:0 ICMP:0 Other:1&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; _
&lt;Ether  dst=29:a0:ea:e9:df:ce src=c3:33:a3:9c:63:9c 
 &#8618;type=n_802_1Q |&lt;Dot1Q  prio=0L id=0L vlan=1L 
 &#8618;type=0x0 |&lt;Padding  load='Nothing to see here' |&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
If you just want to filter out untagged traffic, use
<tt  >filter='vlan'</tt>.

When the Engine Matters</b></p><p>
In Linux, Scapy defaults to PF_PACKET sockets internally. And, to my experience,
sometimes it grabs more than the filter permits. If this happens to you too, force
Scapy to use libpcap as an engine. First, install the pypcap library (it is usually
named python-pypcap or something similar in your package manager). Then, edit
scapy/config.py (depending on how you installed Scapy, it may be under
/usr/lib/python2.7 or somewhere else), and set Conf.use_pcap to True.

Under the Hood</h2></div></div><p>
As you already know, BPF filters are actually expressed in a low-level
assembler-like language. It targets a register-based virtual machine
that has an accumulator register and an index register, along with
some memory store. This machine has access to the packet buffer and
supports several dozens of instructions that store and load values to
the registers or memory, perform arithmetic or logical operations and do
flow control. I won't discuss them in detail, but if you want a
taste of what they look like, here is the equivalent of a libpcap-compiled
simple filter, <tt  >ip</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ldh [12]
jeq #0x800, Keep, Drop
Keep: ret #0xffff
Drop: ret #0x0000
</pre>
</p><p>
Opcode mnemonics come from
the original BPF USENIX paper (Steven McCanne and Van Jacobson's &ldquo;The BSD Packet Filter: A New Architecture for
User-level Packet Capture&rdquo; available at
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/sd93/mccanne.pdf" target="_self">https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/sd93/mccanne.pdf</a>). 
This program loads 16-bit (short)
integer (&ldquo;h&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;half-word&rdquo;) at the fixed offset in
the packet buffer
(12, the Ethernet Type field) and compares it to 0x800 (the IPv4 protocol
number). The filter returns the number of bytes in the packet to allow. Thus,
zero means the packet should be dropped, and 0xffff (the maximum possible
length) means to accept it entirely.
</p><p>
Linux's own implementation of BPF design is known as Linux Socket Filtering
(LSF). It differs from the original BPF slightly (mainly in areas
I haven't mentioned in this article), but largely what I've said here
about BPF applies to LSF.
</p><p>
Given that the virtual machine is register-based, it comes
as no surprise
that its bytecode easily can be compiled to real machine instructions. It is
exactly what a BPF JIT compiler (introduced in Linux 3.0) does. On my
x86_64 system, the code above compiles into:


<pre     class="programlisting">
 0:   push   %rbp
 1:   mov    %rsp,%rbp
 4:   sub    $0x60,%rsp
 8:   mov    %rbx,-0x8(%rbp)
 c:   mov    0x68(%rdi),%r9d
10:   sub    0x6c(%rdi),%r9d
14:   mov    0xd8(%rdi),%r8

This is a small function. By convention, the return value is stored in
%eax register. Everything up to offset 0x1b is the utility stuff, but you
easily can spot loading 0xc (12) to %esi (x86 source index register) and
compare the result to 0x800. A few dozens of machine-level instructions
are needed to check the filter against a packet, and since BPF was
designed to execute filters on the original packet and not a copy of it,
this should really be a fast process.
</p><p>
To control BPF JIT in the Linux kernel, you write to
/proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable (or use the corresponding
sysctl&mdash;see Jonathan Corbet's &ldquo;A JIT for packet filters&rdquo;
at <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/437981" target="_self">https://lwn.net/Articles/437981</a>). A value of 1 means to
enable JIT, and a value of 2 means to enable
tracing. When tracing is enabled, JIT code for the filter is printed to
the kernel log buffer (that's what dmesg reads). With this in place,
you can use the bpf_disasm tool (it comes with the Linux kernel sources)
to print a disassembly.
</p><p>
With the neat high-level language libpcap provides, it is unlikely you
will need to program in BPF &ldquo;assembler&rdquo; directly. But if you ever want
some BPF feature that libpcap doesn't provide (maybe filtering by Netfilter
mark value or something else Linux-specific), take a look at netsniff-ng
(<a href="http://netsniff-ng.org" target="_self">netsniff-ng.org</a>). This toolkit contains a fully functional BPF compiler, bpfc.
</p><p>
Finally, what if you want to integrate BPF filtering capabilities into
your own code? If it isn't possible (or feasible) to link against libpcap
(or use one of its bindings), you can call the native kernel interface
directly. BPF filter programs are represented as <tt  >struct
sock_fprog</tt>
that has a pointer to the array of opcodes (<tt  >struct sock_filter
*</tt>) and
a program length field. A sock_filter structure is what <tt  >tcpdump
-dd</tt>
(or bpfc) prints for you:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# tcpdump -i dummy0 -dd ip
{ 0x28, 0, 0, 0x0000000c },
{ 0x15, 0, 1, 0x00000800 },
{ 0x6, 0, 0, 0x0000ffff },
{ 0x6, 0, 0, 0x00000000 },
</pre>
</p><p>
Sometimes (for example, in a script) you even can execute this command in the
runtime (it is exactly what Scapy does when conf.use_pcap is False).
</p><p>
Filters are attached to (and detached from) the socket with the setsockopt(2)
system call:

<pre     class="programlisting">
setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ATTACH_FILTER, 
 &#8618;&amp;bpf, sizeof(bpf));
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, <tt  >sockfd</tt> is the socket descriptor and
<tt  >bpf</tt> is the <tt  >struct
sock_fprog</tt>.

BPF for Non-Sockets</h2></div></div><p>
So far, I've spoken of BPF (and LSF) as a socket-level facility. To
conclude this article, let's look at it from a different angle. Starting
with Linux 3.9, there is an <tt  >xt_bpf</tt> module that allows you to use BPF in
xtables rules:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A INPUT -m bpf --bytecode "$(nfbpf_compile 
 &#8618;RAW 'tcp dst port telnet')" -j DROP
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >nfbpf_compile</tt> utility comes with iptables, provided those were built
with the <tt  >--enable-bpf-compiler</tt> flag to the configure script.
</p><p>
Some tests show that <tt  >xt_bpf</tt> performs even faster
than the u32 xtables module,
so it's worth considering when you optimize your firewall rules.
</p><p>
Berkeley Packet Filters and their OS-specific implementations are
no substitute for conventional firewalling code (like Netfilter in
Linux). However, they may become indispensable when a fast application or
system-level traffic filtering is the requirement.
