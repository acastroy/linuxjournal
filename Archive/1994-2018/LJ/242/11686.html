IGEL Thin and Zero Clients</h2></div></div><p>
Those working in the clinical field will want to take note of innovations
to the IGEL Thin and Zero Client solutions. IGEL Technology recently
announced that all Linux x86-based hardware and software thin clients now
integrate Imprivata OneSign ProveID Embedded, providing the health-care
industry with secure clinical authentication. The addition of OneSign
ProveID Embedded allows high-performance, user authentication for rapid,
secure access to clinical applications and critical patient information.
Instead of having to enter passwords manually, users log on to virtual
desktops and/or communicate through virtual channels to core medical
applications using a contactless RF-enabled smart card. The resulting
improvement of work processes ensures that staff members have more time to spend with
patients.

ElasticHosts' Elastic Containers</h2></div></div><p>
In a test analysis with its largest customers, ElasticHosts found that
switching to the company's new Elastic Containers&mdash;cloud servers that are
based purely on consumption, rather than capacity&mdash;would result in a
50% or more cost savings. The secret sauce is a breakthrough auto-scaling
container technology that elastically expands and contracts to meet
customer demands, entirely eliminating the need for manual provisioning.
Because each container automatically can scale up to 64GB RAM, companies
can handle usage peaks and valleys more effectively. Aside from disrupting
the cloud market, ElasticHosts adds that Elastic Containers also
will eliminate load balancers and reduce disaster recovery costs.

Mark Edward Soper's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building and Repairing PCs</em></span> (Que Video)</h2></div></div><p>
We Linuxers are a roll-your-own kind of crew. Even for us though, keeping
track of all the latest technologies can be overwhelming. A solution
with our tribe in mind is Mark Edward Soper's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building and
Repairing PCs</em></span>, a
hands-on tutorial dedicated to building and repairing desktop and laptop
PCs. The product consists of three hours of professionally edited,
downloadable videos that cover topics like selection of parts, building a
system, tweaking the BIOS, overclocking, installing the latest components
(such as hard disks), configuring a PC for game performance and more.

Envivio's G5 Family of Appliances</h2></div></div><p>
Envivio's specialty is software-based video processing and delivery
solutions. The company's latest innovation is the Envivio G5 family of
Intel-based server
appliances, featuring increased compression density, support for the latest
Ultra HD 4K resolution and HEVC (H.265) encoding, and a lowering of
operating expenses for service providers. Operators deploying Envivio Muse
Live encoders on the new G5 platform can deliver up to 100 high-quality SD
or 20 HD channels in a 2RU configuration. In a typical IPTV or cable
scenario, this represents a significant cost savings. Rack space
requirements can be reduced by nearly 40% and power consumption by more
than 30% compared to the previous generation of Envivio appliances. Both
1RU and 2RU versions are available, with the latter featuring a modular
hot-swappable, multi-node architecture.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Thanks to collaboration with Google, users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux now
have a new &ldquo;bring-your-own-subscription&rdquo; benefit that enables them
to move their on-site subscription to the Google Compute Engine. The
benefit is part of the Red Hat Cloud Access program, which enables Red Hat
customers to take advantage of the benefits of the Google Cloud Platform
with the confidence that the consistency and quality on a public cloud
matches the on-site version. Red Hat states that Red Hat Cloud Access also
enables customers to maintain a direct relationship with the
company&mdash;including the ability to receive full support from Red Hat's Global
Support Services organization&mdash;on Google Compute Engine. This enables
its customers to maintain a consistent level of service and support across
all certified deployment infrastructures with consistent and predictable
pricing.
