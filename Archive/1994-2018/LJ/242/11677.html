Updating his shell script book, Dave bumps into a legacy Solaris problem, which
leads to all sorts of interesting solution paths and discussion.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2655580.0x274d358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Gah, so frustrating! Ten years ago I wrote a rather popular book called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wicked Cool Shell Scripts</em></span>, and I'm working on a new
edition&mdash;a
Tenth Anniversary release. There are lots of new scripts, entirely new chapters and
updates to the older stuff. Fortunately, Bash hasn't evolved that much in the
last decade, so just about everything still works fine (although there are some
scripts I'm now realizing can't handle spaces in filenames&mdash;something I
talked about years ago in this very column).
</p><p>
But, there were problems when I pushed out the following script to my Google Plus followers (find
me on G+ at <a href="http://profiles.google.com/d1taylor" target="_self">profiles.google.com/d1taylor</a>) and asked those that had access
to a Linux or UNIX system to give it a quick run:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# how many commands: count how many executable commands
#   are in your current PATH.

myPATH="$(echo $PATH | sed -e 's/ /~~/g' -e 's/:/ /g')"
count=0 ; nonex=0

for dirname in $myPATH ;  do
  directory="$(echo $dirname | sed 's/~~/ /g')"
  if [ -d "$directory" ] ; then
    for command in $(ls "$directory") ; do 
      if [ -x "$directory/$command" ] ; then
        count="$(( $count + 1 ))"
      else
        nonex="$(( $nonex + 1 ))"
      fi
    done
  fi
done
echo "$count commands, and $nonex entries that weren't \
   marked executable"
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
It's simple enough really&mdash;I'm using <tt  >sed</tt> to split the $PATH value
into space-separated values, then the for loop to step through them
one by one, counting how many entries are marked as executable (the
<tt  >-x</tt>
test).
</p><p>
Of course, you have to take into account that there might be spaces in directory
names within the PATH (like /User Applications/bin), so I also convert
spaces to ~~ and then later in the for loop convert them back at the
last possible moment. But that's not rocket science, just basic scripting.
</p><p>
Why test to see if the directory in the PATH is an actual directory (the
<tt  >-d</tt> test), you may ask? Because when people can add their own
directories to the system PATH, it can get messy, and it's entirely possible
that there is an entry that's not a valid directory. So that's just
error management really. Perhaps an <tt  >else echo "Error: Entry $directory
isn't a directory?"</tt> would be a good addition.
</p><p>
In any case, I posted this script, and people ran it on various systems,
reporting answers ranging from 1,100 to more than 3,000 executable commands in their
PATH (Ubuntu 13.10). More than 3,000 commands? Sheesh!
Except then there was my friend Chris who said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Sun OS 5.8 The line &ldquo;for command...&rdquo; gives me this error &ldquo;syntax error at
line 10: '$' unexpected&rdquo;.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
That's this line in the script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for dirname in $myPATH ;  do
</pre>
</p><p>
Well, that's puzzling, because there's nothing particularly complicated
in that statement. Perhaps it's the ; in the middle of the line?
Still, a classic&mdash;useless&mdash;error message from the shell.
A bit of digging, and it turns out that he had a different default login shell,
and that /bin/sh in that version apparently wasn't linked to /bin/bash.
Oops. We changed the first line to invoke the proper shell:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
</pre>
</p><p>
And...it still didn't work:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The script ran, but it came back with this: &ldquo;First RE may not be
null&rdquo;. The
second line read, &ldquo;0 commands, and 0 entries that weren't marked
executable&rdquo;.
There are a lot of executable files in my path.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Well heck. Now what?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2655580.0x274deb0"></a>
Running Solaris to Test the Script</h2></div></div><p>
The logical solution was to gain access to a system running Solaris (ideally
SunOS 5.8, aka Solaris 8), but who the heck is running a Solaris system and can
grant me external SSH access? The answer: no one I could find,
which is why it's fortunate that I found a far better path: VirtualBox.
</p><p>
Free to download from Oracle (<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_self">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a>),
VirtualBox is a virtualization system, creating a system within a system.
Even better, it runs on Mac or Windows systems along with various flavors of
Linux, offering the ability to install and run a full Solaris installation (or
just about any other OS you're interested in testing) as an app.
</p><p>
If you've experimented with VMware or Parallels, you've already bumped
into this technology, and it's very slick. In fact, I run Windows 8 Pro on my
MacBook Pro using VMware Fusion, and it works astonishingly well in its own
full-screen window. The down side is that VMware Fusion isn't free. But,
VirtualBox is&mdash;nice.
</p><p>
Download and install it, then you can grab a free copy of SunOS 5.11 (aka
Solaris 11.1) at
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris11/vmtemplates-vmvirtualbox-1949721.html" target="_self">www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris11/vmtemplates-vmvirtualbox-1949721.html</a>.
</p><p>
Unpack the OS and double-click. It's automatically opened by VirtualBox, and
with another click or two, you're running Solaris 11.1 and have the default
window manager, GNOME, front and center, as shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11677f1.large.jpg"><img src="11677f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Solaris 11.1 Running within VirtualBox, within Mac OS X 
</p></div></div><p>
Now finally, I can open up an xterm and test the script within a Solaris
environment. The easiest path? Tweak the VirtualBox config to share the
clipboard with the parent operating system, and you simply can copy and paste it
into a vi edit buffer and save it.
</p><p>
An invocation:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh ./count-cmds.sh
2003 commands, and 15 entries that weren't marked executable
</pre>
</p><p>
Ah great. So in fact, the script works fine in the latest version of SunOS/Solaris but fails in the older version that Chris is running. How old is it?
It turns out that Solaris 8 came out a while back, in February
<span   class="emphasis"><em>2004</em></span>. The same
year my book came out, and I tested the scripts on Solaris 9 prior to
publication.
</p><p>
This leads to the dilemma: the script apparently doesn't work on a
ten-year-old version of Solaris UNIX but works just fine on the latest release,
Solaris 11. Should I care?
</p><p>
This is all tied to the legacy problem: how far back do you need to go to ensure
that your software works? The previous OS release? Five years back? Ten? Longer?
Legacy support has been in the news for Windows users, that's for sure, as
Microsoft just axed support for the ancient Windows XP version of the flagship
operating system. For the record, WinXP was released in October
<span   class="emphasis"><em>2001</em></span>.
Fourteen years later, Microsoft is saying &ldquo;guys, we've had a lot of major
releases since then and can't support it forever&rdquo;, and people are
howling. 
</p><p>
Apple seems to weather this sort of thing more gracefully. When the company
moved from MacOS to Mac OS X, it included &ldquo;Classic Mode&rdquo; where old apps
would mostly run, but the writing was on the wall from the beginning of the OS X
era that Apple wasn't going to &ldquo;do a Microsoft&rdquo; and support the old
OS for years and years.
</p><p>
And, this brings me back to Solaris 8 and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wicked Cool Shell
Scripts</em></span>.
The long and short of it: if the script didn't work properly in Solaris 11,
I'd be concerned and debug the problem, but because it fails in a ten-year-old
version of the OS, I'm going to ignore the problem. If I could log in to a
Solaris 8 system, I might debug it anyway just to understand what's going on,
but is that a reason to slow down the revision of the book? I don't think
so.
</p><p>
Legacy support&mdash;it's a big challenge for every software developer, and
although
Bash and the Linux command-line world hasn't changed that much in the past
few years, it's still something to consider before you ship your own
software (even if it's free software).
</p><p>
So what's your solution? Write to us, and let us know how your company deals
with legacy Linux/UNIX issues!
