If you think hacking is breaking into Pentagon computers to play &ldquo;Global
Thermonuclear War&rdquo; with Joshua, you have good taste in movies, but
unfortunately, not a clear picture of what hackers do. Yes, there is a subset of
folks who take advantage of system vulnerabilities to compromise computer
systems. There's a much larger group of people, however, who just use quick bits of code
to get their jobs done. These &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; aren't nefarious, but are generally not
well planned and executed code. Hacks are like digital duct tape, and
although you
probably can hold an airplane's wing on with duct tape, you wouldn't want to
fly it very far. The same is true with the hacks I talk about here.
They're generally good for a quick fix, but not something you want to build
your infrastructure on. (Unfortunately, simple hacks often get hacked on more
and more, and become production systems, which is not ideal, but nonetheless
can happen. Use your hacking powers wisely and know when your digital duct
tape isn't appropriate.)
</p><p>
In my last article, I described a bunch of simple skills that I now want to demonstrate in
action. Basically, I'm just going to think up a handful of things
I've done through the years and show you an example script. Then I'll go through
them. You probably won't have the same needs I do, but hopefully the
concepts will get you thinking. For example, let's start with a script I
used to
use on my file server to create home directories for newly added users. On a
standalone system, the home directories are created when you add a user, but on
a large network, the processes are often separate. My users would get added to
an LDAP database, and then I'd run the following to create their home
directories:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
# 
# Create home directories on file server

cp -R /etc/skel /home/$1
chown -R $1.$1 /home/$1
chmod 751 /home/$1
echo "Unless you saw an error, everything is good."
</pre>
</p><p>
If you remember from my last article, the <tt  >$1</tt> variable is filled with the first
argument given to the script. In this case, it's a user name (like
&ldquo;spowers&rdquo;).
The script then copies the /etc/skel folder and all of its contents to /home
with the name of the new user. Then ownership is changed to the user's user name
and group, and finally the permissions are set on the user's folder. In my case,
it allows non-owners to enter the directory so Apache can read the user's
public Web folder. This is a real-world example of how to use the
<tt  >$1</tt> variable.
If you had a separate group, you could use <tt  >$2</tt> to specify. Building on this
example, you can come up with elaborate variations to suit your needs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189f580.0x1997828"></a>
Programs Never Die</h2></div></div><p>
The next script is far smaller, but it serves an interesting purpose.
If you're
running a program that is known to crash occasionally (Mono programs are
notorious for this, at least in my experience), it's helpful to have them
automatically restart. It's possible to create an init script or upstart
configuration that will respawn dead processes, but it's often challenging to
get the configuration just right. A quick hack is to put the program in an
endless loop. Here's an example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
#
# Restart program when it dies
while true
do
  /usr/bin/crashy_program
  sleep 10
done
</pre>
</p><p>
If you start this script from rc.local or from crontab on boot (see my
article in the UpFront
section of this issue on using cron to start programs at boot), it will run
crashy_program until it crashes, wait 10 seconds, and then the loop starts
over,
which launches the program again. You do have to be careful, because if
&ldquo;crashy_program&rdquo; is something that launches itself into the background, in
d&aelig;mon mode, the script will just keep starting new instances of the program
until your RAM fills up. You could add a <tt  >pkill
crashy_program</tt> line inside the
loop if you want to clean up any remaining processes before starting the loop
over, but this method of keeping a script running will work well only if the
program doesn't release control of the shell while it's running. Hopefully that
makes sense.

Can You Hear Me Now?</h2></div></div><p>
From here out, the scripts I show you will be more and more complex. There
might even be some stuff thrown in that I didn't cover in my last article, but that's
okay, it should be pretty easy to figure out what's going on. Take this script
for example, which I use to check my Internet connection at home:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
#
# Test Google by IP
wget -q --tries=3 --timeout=5 \
   http://173.194.46.49 -O /tmp/google.idx &amp;&gt; /dev/null

if [ ! -s /tmp/google.idx ]
then
   /usr/local/bin/powercontrol reboot
   sleep 180
   echo "Charter sucks." | mail -s \
        "DANGER WILL ROBINSON: Rebooted Home Router" me@example.com
fi

rm -rf /tmp/google.idx
</pre>
</p><p>
This is literally the code I use to check my Internet connection and power
cycle my modem if need be. First things first, the backslash in a script is
just a way of making the commands more readable. All the \ character does is
break a single command into multiple lines. The system doesn't actually see the
\ character, it sees the entire line. So above, the
<tt  >wget</tt> command is a one-liner that ends with /dev/null.
</p><p>
The script itself uses <tt  >wget</tt> to download the Google search page to
/tmp/google.idx. I use an IP address because often when my modem is off-line,
DNS lookups fail, so that IP address is one of Google's. Anyway,
<tt  >wget</tt> tries to
download the Google page, allowing for three failed attempts with a five-second
timeout. Then the &ldquo;if&rdquo; statement checks to see if it failed at downloading the
file. (That's what the ! does, it negates the test command.) If it failed, it
issues a reboot command to my serial-port-connected power-cycling machine,
waits three minutes for the connection to come back up, and then e-mails me a
notification of the failure. If <tt  >wget</tt> successfully downloads the file, which it
usually does, the if statement is skipped, the downloaded file is erased and
the script ends. I run this via cron every 15 minutes or so, and it works well
to keep my flaky connection stable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189f580.0x1997f08"></a>
Everyone Gets a Web</h2></div></div><p>
The next script goes back to the home directory situation. This time, however,
I use a &ldquo;for&rdquo; loop to affect change to all the folders in the /home directory.
See if you can figure out what this does:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
#
for x in `ls /home`
do
mkdir /home/$x/public_html
chown $x.nobody /home/$x/public_html
chmod 755 /home/$x/public_html
done
</pre>
</p><p>
This script basically creates a set of objects from the <tt  >ls
/home</tt> command
(because it's in backticks), and then executes one loop iteration for each
object in the set. The beauty of this is that it will work whether you have
three
users or 3,000 users. Each iteration of the loop (the part between
<tt  >do</tt> and <tt  >done</tt>)
creates a public_html folder inside the user's folder and gives it the correct
ownership and permissions. You can imagine how much typing this saves for large
numbers of users! I use a variation on this type of loop for lots of
maintenance issues on user files. If I need to copy a single file to everyone's
desktop, a for loop saves the day.
</p><p>
This is probably a good time to remind everyone that quick Bash hacks like
these aren't foolproof. It's best if you first have your script do something
innocent like <tt  >echo</tt> instead of
<tt  >mkdir</tt>, so that it prints on the screen what it is
doing. A simple typo could cause you to wipe out millions of user files, so
it's best to test your script before using it on your live servers or personal
system. This is especially true if you start running
<tt  >rm</tt> commands in a loop&mdash;that's some powerful mojo, which you don't want to use incorrectly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189f580.0x19983d8"></a>
I Hate Typing Things More Than Once</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, I'm going to demonstrate another way I use quick Bash scripts on a regular
basis, and that is to create configuration files. Basically, any time you see
repetitious data in a configuration file, chances are you can write a script
that will save you lots of time. This script is fairly complex, but it uses lots
of the tools I've been talking about. 
This configuration file is actually part of a script I use
to monitor Bitcoin miners, for those who are curious:


<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/bash
# 
BASE_ADDRESS="172.20.1."
LOOP_NUMBER=$(($2 - $1))
# First part of config file
echo "&lt;?php"
# This loop should run for all miners
for MINERLOOP in $(seq 0 $LOOP_NUMBER);
do
echo "\$r[$MINERLOOP]['name'] = 'MINER$(($1 + $MINERLOOP))';"
echo "\$r[$MINERLOOP]['ip'] = '$BASE_ADDRESS$(($1 + $MINERLOOP))';"
echo "\$r[$MINERLOOP]['port'] = '4028';"
echo "\$r[$MINERLOOP]['sick'] = 'FALSE';"
echo " "
done
# And finish off the file
echo "?&gt;"

</pre>
</p><p>
To make this program run, it needs two arguments. The last octet of the IP
addresses of the miners I'm configuring must be entered, so I'd type something
like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./myscript 100 102
</pre>
</p><p>
And the output is:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?php
$r[0]['name'] = 'MINER100';
$r[0]['ip'] = '172.20.1.100';
$r[0]['port'] = '4028';
$r[0]['sick'] = 'FALSE';

$r[1]['name'] = 'MINER101';
$r[1]['ip'] = '172.20.1.101';
$r[1]['port'] = '4028';
$r[1]['sick'] = 'FALSE';

$r[2]['name'] = 'MINER102';
$r[2]['ip'] = '172.20.1.102';
$r[2]['port'] = '4028';
$r[2]['sick'] = 'FALSE';

?&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
If you follow the logic of the script, you'll see it starts by figuring out the
number of loops needed by subtracting the beginning IP octet from the ending
one&mdash;in this case, 102-100=2. You'll notice there are actually three iterations of
the loop, and that's because I'm a little sneaky. I start the loop iterations
at zero, so there are three total loops done. Little quirks like this are figured out
as you test your scripts and are the reason you <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> test your scripts before
depending on them, even if they're for something simple like this. 
</p><p>
Anyway, there are some confusing things in this script that I had to learn how
to do while I was debugging it originally. The <tt  >$(seq 0
$LOOP_NUMBER)</tt>
statement, for example, is really confusing looking. The reason it's required,
however, is because it's not possible to put a variable in a standard range
statement for creating a for loop. My first instinct was to say
<tt  >for MINERLOOP
in {0..$LOOP_NUMBER}</tt>, but that just doesn't work. My brain thinks it should
work, but alas, it doesn't. So, using the <tt  >seq</tt>
command along with the <tt  >$()</tt>
structure, provides the same effect, only with <tt  >seq</tt>, it works.
</p><p>
There might be some confusion with the echo statements too, because since I
needed the <tt  >$</tt> character in my final output, I needed to use a backslash to
&ldquo;escape&rdquo; the next character. The same thing with the + symbol inside the echo
statement. I included the output so you can see what actually happens with the
syntax. Please don't think I wrote this script without pulling my hair out in
frustration several times. Trying to get an exact format can be incredibly
frustrating. In this instance, however, all the script does is print to the
screen. That means it's fairly safe to run just to see if the output is what
you expected. Once it looks correct, you simply can redirect the output of the
script into a file like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./myscript 100 102 &gt; config.php
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x189f580.0x1998b68"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, you end up with a configuration file completely created with minimal input
required by the user. It's important to check that file to make sure it looks
like you expect, but generally, you'll see exactly what printed on the screen
when you ran the script in the first place.

You've Ruined My Mental Image of Sysadmins</h2></div></div><p>
Well, I'm glad. Being a system administrator, or just a skilled end user,
doesn't have to be some mystical dark art. Being a system administrator is more
about thinking differently and problem-solving than anything else. It's great to
have an arsenal of knowledge and know-how under your belt, but just having the
right attitude often is more valuable than having all the answers. If all we
needed were answers, Google would manage all of our servers. Coming up with the
right questions and knowing what tools to use&mdash;that's the real value.
</p><p>
I know some of these scripting examples seem absurdly simple. Some of the most
useful scripts are! The idea with this article was to get you thinking about how to
combine the various scripting basics into something powerful, something useful
and ultimately something that saves you time.
