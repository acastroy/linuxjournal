Net Connectivity in Hotels</h4><p>
In Doc Searls' article &ldquo;Dear Hotels: Quit Being A-holes&rdquo; in
the August 2013 issue, he
writes: &ldquo;In the US and Europe,
the expensive hotels are the ones with inconvenient connectivity deals....It's the cheap hotels that offer free Internet, just like they offer free
electricity, heat, air conditioning and running water.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I've recently stayed in youth hostels in northern Italy and in Alberta,
Canada.
They all had free Wi-Fi. Why would anyone stay in an expensive hotel?
</p><p>
And, I'm a &ldquo;youth&rdquo; of 66&mdash;most youth hostels seem to have no age limit.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
David Brown  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Doc Searls replies:</b></span> Coincidentally, I am a youth of 66 as well. So let's
toast staying young for the duration (clink!).
</p><p>
As I said, mostly I stay in private homes (all with free Internet
connections) when I'm paying my own way. And, I like AirBnB. But the youth
hostel idea is also a good one, and even cheaper. Thanks!

Cerberus, I</h4><p>
In the August 2013 issue, Shawn Powers recommended the Cerberusapp application to track the
location of your Android phone (see his UpFront piece titled &ldquo;Android
Candy: Hire a Cerberus to Find Your Phone&rdquo;). This is indeed a great
app; thanks for
sharing.
</p><p>
However, you should be aware of the privacy policy
(<a href="https://www.cerberusapp.com/privacy.php" target="_self">https://www.cerberusapp.com/privacy.php</a>):

</p><p>
I just thought you and <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> readers should be aware of the privacy
implications when using the app.

Ugh! Thanks for pointing that out. Creepy indeed.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Archive CD?</h4><p>
I already own the 1994&ndash;2009 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Archive CD.
Is there a way to just download/purchase the issues from 2010 onward, or do I have to
purchase another archive disk? Also, do you plan to have another Linux and Amateur
Radio issue? I enjoyed the January 2010 issue.
P.S. I enjoy the articles in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>; keep up the good work.

<br><br>&mdash;<br>

The archive CDs are an all-or-nothing sort of thing. The intention isn't to
resell the same thing every year, but rather to provide a full archive for
those folks hoping to catch up. They're also nice for people like me who
like to &ldquo;collect the whole set&rdquo;, but I don't think there are any plans to
release incremental updates. That said, subscribers have access to the back
issues&mdash;maybe that helps?&mdash;Shawn Powers

Google Reader</h4><p>
I saw Shawn Powers' article on Google Reader via the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> RSS feed (&ldquo;The Google Giveth&rdquo;
in the May 2013 issue).
</p><p>
Go to <a href="http://keepamericaatwork.com" target="_self">keepamericaatwork.com</a>.
I decided to do this when Google Reader disappeared, so that I wouldn't be
dependent on any system.
</p><p>
Basically, I host my own site, and I use a plugin called wp-o-matic that goes out
and grabs the RSS feeds that I program it with.
</p><p>
Because I'm using WordPress, I can categorize those feeds (look on the right-hand
sidebar for the categories), and now I can view articles by category or by searching.
Most important, I can click on a day in the calendar and read all feeds for
that particular day.
</p><p>
And, because I also have subscribed to Keep America At work via the e-mail subscription
plugin, I automatically get a copy of everything that gets added via e-mail in case I
become too busy to check the site itself.
So far, it works like a champ.
</p><p>
The downside is that if you're subscribed via the e-mail plugin, and you add a bunch of
new feeds, you will get a bunch of e-mails until it processes the new
feeds, but then
because most places release only one or two articles per day, it is very manageable.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Virgil   <br><br>
</p><p>
Interesting concept. Over the past few months, I've written about a few ways to
replace Google Reader, but creating a personalized blog that &ldquo;writes
itself&rdquo; based on subscribed feeds...that's interesting. Of course, it
makes me want to have you add your own RSS feed to your feed aggregation
setup, to see if it blows itself up, but that's just the prankster in me
coming out!&mdash;Shawn Powers

Cerberus, II</h4><p>
I often pass on Shawn Powers' &ldquo;Android Candy&rdquo; tips to my wife.
I did so this month for the Cerberus app, but then almost immediately saw this story:
&ldquo;Google Unveils Android Version of 'Find My iPhone'&rdquo;
(<a href="http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2013/08/find-your-lost-phone-with-android.html" target="_self">officialandroid.blogspot.com/2013/08/find-your-lost-phone-with-android.html</a>).
</p><p>
You might want to alert your users to this development in next month's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Bob L.   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks Bob! This is especially interesting based on Aviv's letter regarding
Cerberus. It does mean I'll be reading the fine print on the Google
solution before installing though, that's for sure.&mdash;Shawn Powers
