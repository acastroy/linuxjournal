Computing started out corporate, then it got personal. Same thing happened
with networking. Next up: the cloud.

Maybe the biggest thing that ever happened to Linux&mdash;at least
scale-wise&mdash;is virtualization. As I recall, virtualization first
materialized in a big commercial way with IBM, which started by putting
many Linux instances on System z mainframes. (Once on the old Linux Show, we
had a guest geek from IBM who said it was not only his idea, but also that he
came up with it over lunch.) IBM didn't call those mainframes
&ldquo;clouds&rdquo;,
but that's what it hosted. Now we have clouds of clouds of Linux all over
the place. Nothing could be more widespread and ordinary. (Of Netcraft's
ten most reliable hosting company sites for June of this year, eight are
Linux and two are FreeBSD:
<a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/07/01/most-reliable-hosting-company-sites-in-june-2013-2.html" target="_self">news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/07/01/most-reliable-hosting-company-sites-in-june-2013-2.html</a>.)
</p><p>
Now think about the Internet of Things, often abbreviated IoT. It is
generally assumed today that the Internet of Things will require embedded
smarts. But in fact, any thing can have a cloud, whether the thing has
embedded smarts or not. This insight comes to us from Phil Windley
(<a href="http://www.windley.com" target="_self">www.windley.com</a>), the
hacker-in-chief of Kynetx (<a href="http://kynetx.com" target="_self">kynetx.com</a>), a small Utah start-up with very big plans.
(Disclosure: I sometimes consult them, as I do a number of other
companies.) Phil is also the inventor and alpha maintainer of CloudOS, a
small and simple cloud operating system for anybody and anything, including
you and every thing you own. CloudOS is open source and GPL'd. So is KRL
(kinetic rule language, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_Rule_Language" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_Rule_Language</a>), the first language for programming on CloudOS
(among other things), also first authored by Phil.
</p><p>
By abstracting intelligence away from physical things, we can unburden
those things of the need to be intelligent in themselves. In fact, we can
enlarge to absolute the variety of things that can have intelligence. Phil
embodies this range in the word &ldquo;pico&rdquo;, for <span   class="emphasis"><em>persistent compute
object</em></span>. One
of his is a pothole in front of his house
(<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2013/04/potholes_and_picos.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2013/04/potholes_and_picos.shtml</a>). That pothole has brains in the
cloud Phil gave to it, and that cloud is in Phil's personal cloud
(<a href="http://personal-clouds.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_self">personal-clouds.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>). To help
demonstrate how this can work in everyday life, here is a list of things
I've made smart by giving each its own cloud:

Figure 1. Doc's 30" x 30" tablecloth looks like this QR code.
</p></div></div><p>
The doors to those things' clouds are the QR codes I've hung or stuck on
them&mdash;and, in the case of the last one, the item itself is a QR code.
There can be other doors as well (for example, URLs), but QR codes are handy
because: a) as with Ethernet, the patent owners (Denso, in Japan) decided
they would rather create more value than they capture, so they let anybody do
anything they want with QR codes; and b) they're easy to scan with a
smartphone.
</p><p>
Until now, QR codes have had the misfortune of being exploited mostly by
marketers, which is why they appear as &ldquo;robot barf&rdquo; on promotional jive all
over the place. But now it's time for the hackers to take over, which is
what the ones working for Kynetx have done. They created a service
(<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2013/01/introducing_squaretag.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2013/01/introducing_squaretag.shtml</a>) called
SquareTag (<a href="https://squaretag.com" target="_self">https://squaretag.com</a>), which hosts things' clouds. SquareTag's business model, for now,
is selling hang-tags and stickers with QR codes on them. I'm using some of
the tags and stickers for the things in the list above. (Note that SquareTag
isn't a silo. I can take my things' clouds, plus my own personal cloud, and
put them wherever I want. That means I can self-host them, put them in
Dropbox, or stick them in some other cloud service.)
</p><p>
Through a feature called &ldquo;safe and mine&rdquo; you can present a message to any
Samaritan who scans the QR code of a thing you've lost. For
example, &ldquo;This
bag belongs to (your name). Text me at (your number).&rdquo; From any computing
device, you can write or change that message.
</p><p>
But here's the biggest thing: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Every thing's cloud is a platform for
relationship</em></span>&mdash;between you (as the owner) and whoever else you welcome
aboard: notably the companies that make and sell the things you've bought.
</p><p>
For example, I have messages waiting for the makers of many of the items
above. Here are a few:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Canon &mdash; <span   class="emphasis"><em>I'm in the market for a 5D Mark III when the price for a new
one falls below $2500.</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
LaCrosse &mdash; <span   class="emphasis"><em>I'll be glad to testify my love for the charger in any promo
you want to run. It's the best charger I've ever used. The display also
tends to flicker and fade. Is there an easy fix for that?</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
Sangean &mdash; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gave the radio a 5-star review on Amazon, but I won't buy
another one like it unless it does HD too.</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
Garmin &mdash; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Love the sensitivity and the UI. What I want are more than
10,000 waypoints in memory and the ability to produce KML
files.</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
Dish Network &mdash; <span   class="emphasis"><em>DishAnywhere is a great system. That's mostly how I
watch the VIP 922. What I'd like is to have access to all the menu items
remotely through the browser UI and on the tablet app. Please notify me
when that feature is ready. Thanks.</em></span>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I also can advertise to the world, should I wish, some or all of what I say
about those products in my cloud. Or, I can restrict what I say just to the
companies I invite into a relationship, such as the ones above.
</p><p>
Likewise, any company (such as Canon, LaCrosse, Sangean and Garmin) can give
every product it sells a unique cloud of its own, with its own QR code,
and transfer ownership of that cloud to the customer along with the product
itself. If the customer welcomes a relationship with the company, and the
company agrees to the customer's terms of engagement (such as, &ldquo;respect the
privacy of this communication channel in the following ways&rdquo;), the whole
&ldquo;own cycle&rdquo; of a product becomes a much richer experience for both the
customer and the company. The QR code then becomes what's called a
&ldquo;TalkTag&rdquo;&mdash;meaning that its purpose is to serve as a way for the customer
to signal his or her interest in talking to the company. For example, I can
program the cloud of my Dish Network set-top box to make a scan of its QR
code send a message to the company saying I'd like a call from an agent to
help me work through a problem. I've talked to call-center people about
this possibility and they love it.
</p><p>
What they love especially is that it's now possible to have a standard way
for customers to relate to companies. The problem today is that every
company's CRM (customer relationship management) system is a silo, each
with its own silo'd &ldquo;relationships&rdquo; with customers, all of which are
governed at call centers by IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems,
followed by scripted interactions when a customer gets through to a human
being. If ways can be found to normalize the protocols of genuine
relationships between companies and customers, the work of the call center
can be made far more easy and efficient. In fact, the only way that can
happen is if the customer's side does the normalizing.
</p><p>
Once that happens, both sides can learn far more from each other, in far
better ways. If the product is the platform for a genuine two-way
relationship, both company and customer are in far better positions to
learn from each other. Companies can update manuals and provide notices of
firmware updates. Customers can tell companies directly what's working or
not working, how the product might be improved and what new products the
company might consider making.
</p><p>
We also can start to evolve past the current marketing system, by which
makers and sellers labor constantly to entrap and coerce customers into
restrictive dependencies. Communications inside silo'd coercive systems
tend to be far more restrictive, and far less useful, than communications
between free and independent parties who are ready and able truly to help
each other.
</p><p>
At this point, as T.Rob says in his article in this issue, we're still at the
beginning of whatever it is we'll make of personal clouds. CloudOS itself
is about where Linux was in the months after Linus wrote &ldquo;I'm doing a
(free) operating system...&rdquo;. But the population of available hackers for
personal cloud projects is several orders of magnitude larger than the one
to which Linus wrote. Yet, the challenge is remarkably similar: take something
that has been purely corporate (in this case, &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;), make it personal,
and then ramp it out to everything it might conceivably work on, improving
it along the way, and not stopping.
</p><p>
The result, if all goes according to plan, is a true Internet of Things
and the reframing of business around fully useful relationships between
customers and companies&mdash;or, for that matter, between anybody and anything.
