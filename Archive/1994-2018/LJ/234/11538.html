a small server with this great embedded system for less than $80 US!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b8580.0x18b0250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Olimex is a Bulgarian company known for its innovative hobbyist
products. It has a wide array of microcontroller-based products, ranging
from the small Arduino clones to the very able system that has the Allwinner
A13 microcontroller as its brain. In this article, I describe
how you can create a working Linux system for the Olinuxino A13 and Olinuxino
A13Micro from scratch.
</p><p>
Let's begin by 
obtaining and compiling the kernel, creating the
U-Boot system, preparing the root filesystem and getting the necessary
packages to create a comfortable minimal computing environment. At the
end of this article, I also explain how to install a compact desktop environment.
</p><p>
I am using Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) for my build system. Any
Debian-based system users should be able to follow the instructions in
this article with relative ease. Before you begin, you should create a
directory under your home directory to contain all your work. I am going
to call mine &ldquo;A13System&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b8580.0x18b0510"></a>
What Are Arm and eabihf?</h2></div></div><p>
As you progress further into the article, you will encounter the terms
Arm and eabihf more than once. Let me clarify those terms
in order to avoid confusion with other terms that you might encounter
if you decide to go further into the world of cross-compilation.
</p><p>
Arm is a general name for a family of microcontroller architectures
designed by ARM Holdings, a British company. You can find Arm
microcontrollers inside most portable modern gadgets, ranging from mobile
phones, Nintendo DS portable game consoles to Apple iPhone and Apple
TV. ARM Holdings does not manufacture these microcontrollers; rather, it
licenses the designs to other companies. These companies then add their
own &ldquo;secret recipes&rdquo; into the designs and then manufacture and sell the
finished microcontrollers. This is why there are so many variants of
Arm architecture and so many companies that produce Arm microcontrollers.
</p><p>
EABI stands for Embedded Application Binary Interface. It specifies
the low-level conventions for embedded software application. When it
comes to Arm microcontrollers, they come in many sizes, ranging from
very small to large. The smaller variants don't have the necessary memory
or power to process floating-point computation on the hardware itself,
thus making it necessary to do it by software. These variants are called
Arm soft float. There are other variants that can process the
floating-point calculation by hardware, like vector floating point (vfp). These two
EABIs (soft float and vfp) are what is usually known as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>armel</em></span>. A
newer EABI that targets the higher end of Arm microcontrollers with more
efficient floating-point instructions than vfp is called hard float,
thus <span   class="emphasis"><em>armhf</em></span>.
</p><p>
Olimex's A13WiFI, A13 and A13Micro boards are powered by the Allwinner A13
Arm microcontroller, which are based on ARMv7 design. ARMv7, as with
the newer ARMv8, fully supports armhf.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b8580.0x18b0828"></a>
Prerequisites</h2></div></div><p>
You can find all the necessary URLs for file downloads and other
information in the Resources section of this article. You need to
install the following programs before you can commence the build process:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
build-essential.
</p></li><li><p>
gcc-4.6-arm-linux-gnueabihf (the version might vary from one distro to 
another; the latest I came across at the time of this writing is version
4.7).
</p></li><li><p>
ncurses-dev.
</p></li><li><p>
uboot-mkimage.
</p></li><li><p>
git.
</p></li><li><p>
debootstrap.
</p></li><li><p>
debian-archive-keyring (if you decide later that you want to use Debian 
rootfs).
</p></li><li><p>
qemu-user-static.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once you finish installing the prerequisites, you then
need to create several softlinks in the same directory where
gcc-4.6-arm-linux-gnueabihf is installed (in my case, it is located in
/usr/bin). Use the <tt  >which</tt> command to find the installation directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ which arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc-4.6
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, create softlinks for arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc-4.6, 
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcov-4.6 and arm-linux-gnueabihf-cpp-4.6:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc-4.6 \
 /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc
$ sudo ln -s \
 /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcov-4.6 \
 /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcov
$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-cpp-4.6 \
 /usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-cpp
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b8580.0x18b10c0"></a>
Preparing the Kernel and U-Boot</h2></div></div><p>
The good people at Linux Sunxi are kind enough to share the kernel and
U-Boot code tailored to run on Allwinner chips. You have the option
of getting and compiling version 3.0 or 3.4 of the Linux kernel. The
compilation procedures are similar. For the purpose of this article,
I am using kernel version 3.4. Get the kernel and U-Boot
source from Linux Sunxi's GitHub repository:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ git clone -b sunxi-3.4
 https://github.com/linux-sunxi/linux-sunxi.git
$ git clone -b sunxi
 https://github.com/linux-sunxi/u-boot-sunxi.git
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's compile U-Boot first.
Depending on the target
system (A13 or A13Micro), go to the U-Boot directory and issue the
following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make a13-olinuxino \
 CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b8580.0x18b1328"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make a13-olinuxinom \
 CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
</pre>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Note:</em></span> the dash (-) at the end of the commands are not typos.
After the make process finishes, if everything goes correctly, you should
end up with u-boot.bin and spl/sunxi-spl.bin.
</p><p>
Go to the kernel source directory. Check the configuration directory
($KERNEL_DIR/arch/arm/configs) for the A13 configuration file
(a13_defconfig) or A13Micro (a13om_defconfig). If you do not have the
configuration file for A13Micro (which is usually the case), you can
find the download URL in the Resources section.
</p><p>
Now you need to check the configuration file for a specific line. I
learned the hard way that without this line, the compilation will fail. Add
the following line to your configuration file if it does not exist or
uncomment it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CONFIG_GPIOLIB=y
</pre>
</p><p>
Once again, depending on the target system, issue one of these sets of
commands to compile the kernel source:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make ARCH=arm a13_defconfig
$ make menuconfig
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b8580.0x18b16f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make ARCH=arm a13om_defconfig
$ make menuconfig
</pre>
</p><p>
The last step allows you to customize your kernel.
In order to avoid a long and painful debugging process, always make sure
you are able to compile the minimal kernel (that means compiling
without any options added) successfully first. Once you succeed, you can
add more options to your kernel. Note any options you add to the
kernel configuration, as it will aid you in figuring out which feature(s)
does not work.
</p><p>
There is a special step you should adhere to if you are compiling
the kernel for A13Micro boards. You need to remove the option to
&ldquo;Suspend to RAM and standby&rdquo;, which is located under &ldquo;Power Management
options&rdquo;. A13Micro boards do not support this option.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11538f1.large.jpg"><img src="11538f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. Uncheck Suspend to RAM and Standby
</p></div></div><p>
If you are planning to use any of the board's GPIO pins, make sure that
you select &ldquo;An ugly sun4i gpio driver&rdquo; option under
&ldquo;Device Drivers&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Misc devices&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11538f3.large.jpg"><img src="11538f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Selecting Misc Devices under Device Drivers
</p></div></div><p>
I also plan to use Olimex's MOD-WIFI USB Stick
Module<sup  >2</sup> that
adds the Wi-Fi capabilities to the board. To do that, you need to include
the driver for the module, which is called &ldquo;Realtek 8192C USB Wifi for
SW&rdquo; and is located under &ldquo;Device Drivers/Network device support/Wireless
LAN&rdquo;. You are welcome to experiment with other Wi-Fi devices. I can
vouch that I successfully run the A13 board with the Netgear WG111v2 USB
Wifi Stick module. The driver I used for this Wi-Fi device was &ldquo;Realtek
8187 and 8187B USB support&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11538f4.large.jpg"><img src="11538f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Realtek 8192C Driver as a Module
</p></div></div><p>
You also have to make sure that TCP/IP is selected and included in
the kernel. Tick Networking Support and press Enter to select it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11538f5.large.jpg"><img src="11538f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

selected.

Figure 6. Make sure that TCP/IP networking is selected.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you are satisfied with your configuration, save it and go back to
the command prompt. Issue the following commands to compile the kernel
and build the drivers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make ARCH=arm \
 CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- uImage
$ make ARCH=arm \
 CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- \
 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=out modules
$ make ARCH=arm \
 CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- \
 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=out modules_install
</pre>
</p><p>
When the compilation finishes, you will end up with the kernel image
in $KERNEL_DIR/arch/arm/boot/uImage and the modules and drivers in
$KERNEL_DIR/out/lib/modules/$KERNEL_VERSION.
</p><p>
The next step is to prepare a minimal filesystem for your board. The
easiest option I've found so far is by using the root filesystem from the
Debian project or Ubuntu, as both distributions provide armhf binaries
for the essential applications. I explain how to prepare both options next.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b8580.0x1caab78"></a>
Preparing the Filesystem: Debian Wheezy</h2></div></div><p>
Start by creating a new directory for your root filesystem. For the sake of
clarity, I call mine debian-rootfs. You'll
use an application called debootstrap to pull the basic
filesystem structure from a Debian repository. You are free to use a
repository that is closer to you, rather than the same one I use
in this example. Enter the following as root or using sudo, inside your
newly created directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# debootstrap --foreign --arch armhf wheezy \
 /home/user/A13System/debian-rootfs \
 http://ftp.debian.org/debian
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the resulting structure is still not a complete
filesystem. The next step is to create a chroot system within your
new directory. For those of you who are not familiar with chroot, this
command effectively creates an isolated system within your
&ldquo;host&rdquo; system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cp $(which qemu-arm-static) \
 /home/user/A13System/debian-rootfs/usr/bin
# mount -t proc proc \
 /home/user/A13System/debian-rootfs/proc
# chroot /home/user/debian-rootfs /bin/bash

I have no name!# ./debootstrap/debootstrap \
 --second-stage
</pre>
</p><p>
Copy the qemu-arm-static binary into your root filesystem's
/usr/bin directory. The qemu-arm-static binary helps run the armhf
binaries from your x86/64-bit systems. You also need to mount the host's
proc filesystem into your chroot system. When you first get inside the
chroot system, you might find a strange prompt greeting you (&ldquo;I have no
name!&rdquo;). This is not a cause for concern, and you can safely disregard
it. Once you are inside your chroot system, execute another call to
debootstrap to complete the base system (with
<tt  >--second-stage</tt>).
</p><p>
If you are curious whether you really are running an armhf system within
your chroot system, issue the <tt  >uname</tt> command to
check. If you see something
like &ldquo;armv7l&rdquo; somewhere in the output, it is an indication
that your
chroot is running the armhf system.
</p><p>
The next step is to update your apt source list file. Within your
chroot system, or using the build host's editor, go and edit the
file /etc/apt/sources.list that resides inside your root filesystem
directory. Add the following lines to this file (remember, you can
use other Debian repositories as well):

<pre     class="programlisting">
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy main \
 contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy main \
 contrib non-free

deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian wheezy-updates \
 main contrib non-free
deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian \
 wheezy-updates main contrib non-free

deb http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates \
 main contrib non-free
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ \
 wheezy/updates main contrib non-free
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b8580.0x1cab0f8"></a>
Preparing the Filesystem: Ubuntu</h2></div></div><p>
If you are feeling adventurous, you always can try to debootstrap
your Ubuntu root filesystem, just like I described in the previous
section. (You also can find instructions on the Internet for
that.) Here, let's opt for an easier way and just download a ready-made
minimal root filesystem provided by Ubuntu. Several packages
are available, including Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10 and 13.04. Make sure that
you are downloading the armhf version of the root filesystem package.
</p><p>
Create a directory for your Ubuntu root filesystem and extract the contents
of the file you just downloaded into it. Your next move should
be to edit /etc/resolv.conf and add your nameserver in there. Also,
take a look at your sources.list file in /etc/apt/. You might want
to add <tt  >universe</tt> and
<tt  >multiverse</tt> at the end of each deb and
deb-src line.
</p><p>
You should check the version number of your qemu-arm-static. Version
1.0.50 that comes with standard install of Ubuntu 12.04 generates errors
when running the following steps on my build system for the Ubuntu root filesystem. To solve the problem, I had to compile my own qemu-arm-static. I
used version 1.0.91 (see Resources for the download URL of the source
package). 
Do the following steps to configure and
compile the binary, and copy the resulting qemu-arm to qemu-arm-static
inside your Ubuntu root filesystem's /usr/bin directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure \
 --prefix=/home/user/A13System/qemu-arm-static \
 --static --disable-kvm \
 --target-list=arm-linux-user

$ make
$ make install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b8580.0x1cab3b8"></a>
Finishing Touches for the Root Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>
What you have so far is just a very basic filesystem. Now let's 
improve it so that you have the tools required for a comfortable basic
computing environment. Change the locales generated according to your own
locale. All the processes described next are done inside the chroot system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@host:/# apt-get update
root@host:/# apt-get install apt-utils ncurses-dev
root@host:/# apt-get install dialog locales tzdata
root@host:/# locale-gen en_AU en_AU.UTF-8
root@host:/# dpkg-reconfigure locales
root@host:/# dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
root@host:/# apt-get install iputils-ping \
 wpasupplicant dhcpcd5 sudo openssh-server ntp \
 openssh-client
root@host:/# apt-get install nano vim gettext \
 bison automake autoconf
root@host:/# apt-get install python rsyslog \
 network-manager alsa-utils
</pre>
</p><p>
Now let's configure Wi-Fi connectivity. I'm assuming that
you're using a Wi-Fi USB adapter for your connectivity and that your wireless
network connection configuration is using WPA for security. Change the
steps accordingly for your configuration. Edit your /etc/network/interfaces
and add the following lines, changing the values as needed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
auto wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-ssid YOUR_ESSID
wpa-psk YOUR_PASSPHRASE
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, if you want your bash shell to have autocompletion, edit
/etc/bash.bashrc and uncomment some of the lines to be something like
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# Commented out, don't overwrite xterm -T
# "title" -n "icontitle" by default.
# If this is an xterm set the title to
# user@host:dir
case "$TERM" in
xterm*|rxvt*)
 PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne \
 "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}: ${PWD}\007"'
 ;;
*)
 ;;
esac

# enable bash completion in interactive shells
if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] &amp;&amp; ! shopt -oq \
posix; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
fi

</pre>
</p><p>
Check /etc/shadow for the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root:*:15629:0:99999:7:::
daemon:*:15629:0:99999:7:::
</pre>
</p><p>
If you see an asterisk (*) after the first colon on the line for root,
you should remove it. This will allow you to set the root password yourself on
the first run.
</p><p>
You have completed the process of building the root filesystem for
your board. Next, let's compress the entire root filesystem so you can
deploy it easily to your MicroSD card later. Exit the chroot environment
and do the following inside your root filesystem directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# umount proc
# rm ./usr/bin/qemu-arm-static
# tar -zcvf /home/user/my-rootfs.tar.gz *
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b8580.0x1cab888"></a>
Preparing the MicroSD Card</h2></div></div><p>
I am using a 4GB MicroSD card for my board. I am sure that a 2GB MicroSD card
would be sufficient to contain all your files, but it is nice to have
some room for additional applications. You need to create two partitions
on your empty MicroSD card. The first one is a VFAT partition of around
17MB for U-Boot and the kernel image. The rest will be used to store your
root filesystem.
</p><p>
Mount the MicroSD card. Take note of the device name your computer gives
the MicroSD card. Some computers recognize the card as /dev/sdX,
while others call it /dev/mmcblkX (for this example, I assuming that your card
is recognized as /dev/sdb):

<pre     class="programlisting">
# fdisk -u=sectors /dev/sdb
</pre>
</p><p>
Type &ldquo;p&rdquo; to list the partitions inside the card. If you have any
partitions at all listed, delete them by pressing &ldquo;d&rdquo;. Once the card
is empty, create a new partition by pressing &ldquo;n&rdquo;. Make this the first
primary partition. fdisk is going to ask you for starting and ending
sector numbers. Type &ldquo;2048&rdquo; and &ldquo;34815&rdquo;, respectively. Repeat the process
for the second partition. This time, just press Enter when asked for
starting and ending sector numbers; fdisk will use the default values,
which will fill the remainder of the card.
</p><p>
Type &ldquo;p&rdquo; again to list the partitions. You should see
something like what is shown in Figure 7.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11538f7.large.jpg"><img src="11538f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. List of Partitions on a 4GB MicroSD Card
</p></div></div><p>
Type &ldquo;w&rdquo; to write the changes permanently onto the card. Now, 
create the two filesystem types on the partitions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1
# mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb2
</pre>
</p><p>
Don't forget to do the sync after every command you type for the
MicroSD card. Sync ensures that the changes are flushed and keeps the
card in the correct state. Next, mount the partitions. I am assuming
the mountpoints are /media/card1 for /dev/sdb1 and /media/card2
for /dev/sdb2. First, populate the root filesystem and
copy the kernel modules onto the first partition:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /media/card2
# tar -xzvf /home/user/A13System/my-rootfs.tar.gz
# sync
...[THIS WILL TAKE SOME TIME]
# cp -a $KERNEL_DIR/out/lib/modules/3.4.43+/ \
 ./lib/modules/.
# sync
</pre>
</p><p>
Copy the uImage file from your kernel
directory (in arch/arm/boot) to the first partition, along with a file
called script.bin. script.bin stores the system configuration settings
necessary for Allwinner chips. If you want to edit these settings,
convert this .bin file into a .fex file using a tool called
bin2fex. You can edit the resulting file with any text editor.
</p><p>
For the last step, you need to write U-Boot onto the card itself. Pay
extra attention to what you type here, as you are not going to write to
/dev/sdb1 or /dev/sdb2 but to /dev/sdb:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /home/user/A13System/u-boot
# dd if=spl/sunxi-spl.bin of=/dev/sdb bs=1024 \
 seek=8
# dd if=u-boot.bin of=/dev/sdb bs=1024 seek=32
# sync
</pre>
</p><p>
Now your MicroSD card is ready to use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b8580.0x1bbcae0"></a>
First Run</h2></div></div><p>
Plug in the card in the slot on the board. Also plug in the Wi-Fi USB
Stick, a keyboard and the VGA monitor (use a USB hub if you have to). Plug
in the power cord and wait for the login prompt.
</p><p>
Log in with the root account. You shouldn't need a password for the
first run. After you get in, set a secure password for your root account
and create another account for your daily use. Put this new user into
the sudoers file. Check whether you have network connectivity. Test the board
remotely by connecting to it via SSH. If you can do all that successfully,
congratulations! You have a great minimalist PC/server at your disposal.

Desktop Environment</h2></div></div><p>
If you are interested in using this board with a graphical user interface,
you need to use a lightweight GUI environment, because the board
does not have much RAM to spare. There are several options from which to
choose, such as LXDE and XFCE4; however, I use a different
package here called Fluxbox. You also need to install a light graphical login
manager. Using the package manager, install lightdm and fluxbox. Yes, it
is really that easy. These commands will install the desktop environment,
graphical login manager and their required servers and libraries:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@a13board:/# apt-get install lightdm fluxbox
</pre>

Restart the board. When the board restarts, you will be greeted with
your new login manager. Make sure you select Fluxbox from the session
menu on Lightdm screen when you are logging in. Enjoy your new mini-personal computer/server!
