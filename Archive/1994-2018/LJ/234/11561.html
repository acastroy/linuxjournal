Command-Line Cloud: rss2email

Now that Google Reader is dead and buried, I've switched to a
much simpler approach to viewing RSS feeds.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2766580.0x285e3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I started a series called Command-Line Cloud. The intent of
the series is to discuss how to use the cloud services we are faced
with these days without resorting to a Web browser. I spend most of my
time on the command line, so that's where I'd most like to interface with
cloud services. My last article described how to use Google Calendar
from the command line, and in this article, I talk about a more general
cloud service&mdash;RSS feeds. If I had written this column a few months
ago, it would have been more focused on replacing Google Reader itself,
because that was the primary RSS aggregator I used, but Google preemptively
killed off the service and left a lot of users, including myself, scrambling
to find a replacement. Although a number of people were able to find some
sort of Web-based replacement, I realized the main features I wanted
(sorting stories by date and vi key bindings to view the next story) were
absent in a lot of the existing Google Reader replacements. What's worse,
a lot of people were using this as an opportunity to make a quick buck
by selling access to RSS services (and of course, still capturing everyone's
valuable Web-viewing habits).
</p><p>
I decided to take a completely different tack and convert my RSS feeds to
e-mail in a special mailbox and use an interface I already was used to:
e-mail on the command line using mutt. I decided to use the rss2email
program, written by the great Aaron Swartz, to manage my feeds. This
software pulls down RSS feeds and converts each story into its own e-mail
message
that it sends to you. This means you can use whatever e-mail program
you want to read your feeds, but of course, because we are focusing on the
command line here, I am going to talk about only mutt.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2766580.0x285e618"></a>
Installation and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
The rss2email program already had Debian packages, so on my system,
installing it was as easy as typing <tt  >apt-get install
rss2email</tt>. If for
some reason it isn't packaged for your distribution, follow the steps on
<a href="http://www.allthingsrss.com/rss2email/getting-started-with-rss2email" target="_self">www.allthingsrss.com/rss2email/getting-started-with-rss2email</a>
to download and extract the rss2email tarball. This is Python software,
so you will need Python 2.x on the system as well as some sort of local
Sendmail program (Postfix or Exim works as well), or alternatively, you'll
need to identify an outbound mail server you can use to send these e-mail
messages.
</p><p>
Once rss2email is installed, you interface with it via the
<tt  >r2e</tt>
command. To set up a new rss2email database containing your feeds, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ r2e new youremail@yourdomain.net
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the e-mail address you use here will be the e-mail to which rss2email
will send the e-mail messages. Once the database is set up, it's time to add
feeds to it. You can do that with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ r2e add http://feed.someurl.com/rss
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2766580.0x285e988"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Or, if you happen to have an OPML file (such as you may have exported
from Google Reader when you jumped ship), you can import that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ r2e opmlimport file.opml
</pre>
</p><p>
At any point, you also can export all of your configured feeds from
rss2email as an OPML file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ r2e opmlexport
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have added some feeds, you will want to poll them for new
stories. Now the first time you run r2e against these feeds, it will pull
in all stories in the feed, which probably includes some you already
have seen. If you want to avoid that, the first time you will want to run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ r2e run --no-send
</pre>
</p><p>
Otherwise, run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ r2e run
</pre>
</p><p>
The first time it may take a while, because it reads all of your feeds
and generates e-mail. Of course, by default, it will send all the stories
to your INBOX, so because I control my own mail server, I created a special
e-mail address for rss2email to use and then set up a procmail rule so that
it forwarded all e-mail messages sent to that address to a special rss mailbox.
</p><p>
Of course, rss2email updates your feeds only when you run the command,
so you probably will want to run this within cron so it updates
automatically. Just run <tt  >crontab -e</tt> as your regular user and add:

<pre     class="programlisting">
* *     * * *    r2e run 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre>
</p><p>
This will run r2e every minute and output any random error (such as
when feeds are temporarily down) to /dev/null instead of sending you e-mail
every time. For the most part, rss2email works as is, but in my case,
I wanted to change two extra settings. To do this, just open
up ~/.rss2email/config.py in a text editor and add the following
settings:

<pre     class="programlisting">
HTML_MAIL = 1
DATE_HEADER = 1
</pre>
</p><p>
The first setting tells rss2email to send the e-mail as HTML mail, and 
the second dates the message based on the date of the news story, not
the date it picked it up. Although you might be surprised that I opt for
HTML e-mail in my text-based e-mail client, mutt automatically converts
HTML e-mail to text for me. Plus, when I tell mutt to open the e-mail in an
external viewer, on pure shell sessions, it means I can view the
full article in a text-based Web browser, such as w3m, very easily. And,
when I run mutt on a machine with a Web browser, it can open the full
article there instead.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2766580.0x285efb8"></a>
Managing Feeds</h2></div></div><p>
Managing feeds in rss2email is relatively straightforward. First type
<tt  >r2e list</tt> to see a numbered list of all of your feeds. You will use the
number associated with a feed to manage it. For instance, to get rid of
a feed numbered 12, you would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ r2e delete 12
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can pause feeds if you want to ignore them temporarily with
<tt  >r2e
pause <i>number</i></tt> and then unpause it with
<tt  >r2e unpause <i>number</i></tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2766580.0x285f328"></a>
Mutt as the Front End</h2></div></div><p>
What makes this set up work so well for me is that I can use my regular
mail program, mutt, to view my feeds. This means I quickly can scan my
feeds and skip uninteresting or duplicate stories. In my case, I found
I needed to tweak how mutt displays the index for this mailbox so
I more easily could see who the feed was from. By default, mutt sets the
index_format to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%4l) %s"
</pre>
</p><p>
So, I set up a folder-hook so that when I'm in the rss mailbox, I get a
slightly tweaked index:


<pre     class="programlisting">
folder-hook rss 'set index_format="%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-20.20f  %s"'
</pre>
</p><p>
The main change I made was to remove the column that displayed the size
of the message (%4l), and had it display the complete FROM: line of the
e-mail and gave myself a little extra room in that column
(<tt  >%-20.20f</tt>). The
result is a much more readable feed list, as you can see in Figure 1.

Figure 1. RSS Feeds inside Mutt
</p></div></div><p>
Although it's true that I miss out on images within my news feeds, in many
cases, that just means I miss out on ads or clipart. When I run mutt
from a machine with a Web browser and view the HTML, it opens the e-mail
inside the Web browser, and from there, I can view images if I want.
For those feeds that post only a summary of the article, I can follow
the hyperlinks to the main article and read it in full.
</p><p>
Viewing my news this way may not appear to be as
full-featured as with using a Web-based client, but it's a lot more flexible.
Plus, in
my case, I often have hundreds of stories to pore through, so viewing just
the text versions of stories helps me focus on what's most important&mdash;the
data.
