time on my home computer. After the excitement of having a Unix
workstation at home had faded away, I started looking for a way to
port my molecular graphics program Viewmol to Linux. I used to work
with IBM and Silicon Graphics workstations, and Viewmol had been
written using the Silicon Graphics' Graphics Library (Iris GL).
There are a lot of 3D graphics libraries available for Linux (over
180 are listed on the Technische Universitat Berlin web site,
<a href="http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~ki/engines.html" target="_self">www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~ki/engines.html</a>)
including some rudimentary implementations of Iris GL (YGL at
<a href="http://WWW.thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE/Ygl/ReadMe.html" target="_self">WWW.thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE/Ygl/ReadMe.html</a>,
2D only, and VOGL at
<a href="http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~philippe/vogl" target="_self">http://www.cs.kuleuven.ac.be/~philippe/vogl/</a>),
but none of the libraries had the full functionality that I
needed&mdash;then I discovered Mesa. Mesa is a 3D graphics library which
is source code compatible with OpenGL, Silicon Graphics' successor
to Iris GL. Mesa's goal is to make programs which have been written
for OpenGL runnable on every X windows system including Linux. So I
took a better look at Mesa and decided to rewrite my program for
OpenGL.
</p><p>Mesa has been written mainly by Brian Paul over the last 3
years and is currently (as of this writing) at version 1.2.8.
Nearly all of the OpenGL functionality is available; the only
missing features are anti-aliasing, mip-mapping, polygon stippling
and some of the texture querying functions. Mesa's home page,
<a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html" target="_self">www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html</a>,
lists a number of applications (basically scientific visualization
tools, but also a VRML browser) which use it. Currently, Mesa can
be called from C and Fortran routines.</p><p>While OpenGL has been designed as a software interface to
high-performance (and high-price) graphics hardware, Mesa is a
software-only solution which uses X windows to interface with the
hardware. (Recently a SVGA driver and some support for 3D
PC-hardware have been added to Mesa.) Therefore Mesa based programs
usually execute slower than OpenGL based programs. Both libraries
are hardware independent and window system independent; thus, the
handling of the window system is left to the application
programmer. Having the programmer handle windowing is different
from Iris GL, but was considered necessary for Mesa in order to
achieve hardware independence. OpenGL is the standard for 3D
computer graphics and is managed by the Architecture Review Board.
Implementations are available for a number of operating systems:
different flavours of Unix, Windows and MacOS. Mesa also supports
all these platforms. OpenGL requires an extension, GLX, in the X
server to run. Mesa does not need this extension as it emulates the
calls to GLX. There are commercial implementations of OpenGL
available for Linux which also include X servers with GLX.</p><p>OpenGL/Mesa (I will use only the term Mesa in the following
text, but it should be noted that everything applies to OpenGL as
well) do not provide high-level commands for describing models in
3D. They do provide the necessary graphics primitives (e.g.,
points, lines, polygons) to build and manipulate models. Mesa
provides the programmer with the ability to perform model building
and manipulation completely in three dimensional space. All the
details of converting the 3D model to a drawing on a flat screen
are handled by the library, including one of the most tedious tasks
in 3D programming&mdash;removal of hidden lines and surfaces. Mesa also
offers &ldquo;special effects&rdquo; such as texture mapping, fog or
blending.</p><p>Mesa's primary ftp site is iris.ssec.wisc.edu, but it can
also be found at the usual places for Linux. Installation is
easy&mdash;first unload the archive file using the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gzcat Mesa-1.2.8.tar.gz | tar xf -
</pre><p>then for a.out give the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make linux
</pre><p>or for ELF give:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make linux-elf
</pre><p>Executing make will compile the Mesa library, the GL utility
library (GLU), the tk and auxiliary libraries, and a whole bunch of
example programs. (Mesa's makefile comes configured for 46
different operating systems, including MS Windows.) I have found
compilation to be hassle free on at least Linux, AIX, Irix and
OSF1. The compiled libraries can be found in Mesa-1.2.8/lib and
should be installed in either /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib. The
header files (Mesa-1.2.8/include) should also be copied to either
/usr/include or /usr/local/include. This step was not included in
our make process&mdash;the following examples all assume that Mesa is
installed in both /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include.</p><p>The compilation produces a total of four libraries.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>1) libMesaGL.* contains all the basic graphics
code.</p></li><li><p>2) libMesaGLU.* provides some higher level
functions, such as subroutines to draw geometric objects, splines
etc.</p></li><li><p>3) libMesaaux.* is an auxiliary library that is not
really a part of Mesa. Since Mesa is window system independent,
some simple window manipulation functions were needed. This library
was created to demonstrate the features of OpenGL in the OpenGL
Programming Guide (&ldquo;The Red Book&rdquo;). It is included with Mesa so
that all the example programs from &ldquo;The Red Book&rdquo; which are
included in the Mesa distribution can be compiled.</p></li><li><p>4) libMesatk.* is another window system support
library. libMesaaux.* relies on libMesatk.*, so to successfully
link a program which uses libMesaaux.* -lMesatak must be added to
the command line.</p></li></ul></div><p>I don't wish to bore you with the usual &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo;
program. So since Mesa is a graphics library, we will start with
something more appropriate to its function. Let's draw some
geometric shapes:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include&lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
#include&lt;glaux.h&gt;
void display(void
{
  glClearColor(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
  glColor3f(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
  glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
  glLoadIdentity();
  glOrtho(-1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0);
  glBegin(GL_LINES);
  glVertex2f(-1.0, -1.0);
  glVertex2f(1.0, 1.0);
  glEnd();
  glBegin(GL_POLYGON);
  glVertex2f(0.25, -0.75);
  glVertex2f(0.75, -0.75);
  glVertex2f(0.75, -0.25);
  glVertex2f(0.25, -0.25);
  glEnd();
  glFlush();
}
void main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  auxInitDisplayMode(AUX_SINGLE | AUX_RGB);
  auxInitPosition(0, 0, 500, 500);
  auxInitWindow(argv[0]);
  auxMainLoop(display);
}
</pre><p>As you can see, there is a naming convention for all
functions. All Mesa functions start with the letters
<b  >gl</b>. Functions in the auxiliary library start
with the letters <b  >aux</b>. The first two calls to the
auxiliary library in <b  >main()</b> specify the desired
frame buffer configuration, i.e. single buffered, rgb mode. (There
is also a double buffered configuration for animations and a
colormap mode, but rgb mode is preferred and is easier to handle.)
The third call opens a window, and the fourth call enters an
infinite loop in which the function <b  >display()</b>
will be called whenever a redraw request is received from X
windows. As I mentioned earlier, Mesa does not deal directly with
the interface to the windowing system. The auxiliary library
provides only the very basics and is not suited for larger
programs&mdash;more about alternatives later.</p><p>The <b  >display()</b> function starts with two
calls to clear the background of the window to white&mdash;first we
specify the desired color with <b  >glClearColor()</b>
and then we clear the color buffer with
<b  >glClear()</b>. Following that we set the drawing
color to black and set up a projection matrix using
<b  >glMatrixMode()</b>,
<b  >glLoadIdentity()</b> and
<b  >glOrtho()</b>. Since Mesa can handle all the
necessary mathematics to create a 2D drawing from our 3D world, we
have only to give the instructions for making the projections.
First we use <b  >glMatrixMode()</b> to specify that we
are going to manipulate the projection matrix. (There is a modeling
matrix to translate or rotate objects that we discuss later.) Then
we load an identity matrix to initialize the matrix stack, and
finally, we use <b  >glOrtho()</b> to specify an
orthogonal projection. Now we draw a line from the lower left to
the upper right corner of the window and a square in the lower
right quadrant.</p><p>All drawing primitives in Mesa are created by embracing their
vertex specifications with calls to <b  >glBegin()</b>
and <b  >glEnd()</b>. In the call to
<b  >glBegin()</b> we specify the primitive we wish to
draw. Available primitives are GL_POINTS, GL_LINES, GL_LINE_STRIP,
GL_LINE_LOOP, GL_POLYGON, GL_QUADS, GL_QUAD_STRIP, GL_TRIANGLES,
GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP and GL_TRIANGLE_FAN.</p><p>Finally, we call <b  >glFlush()</b> to tell Mesa to
flush its graphics pipeline and display the objects we have
specified. To compile our demo program (assume it has been stored
under the name demo1.c), we execute the following command (note
that the standard Xlib, the X extension library and the math
library are needed to resolve all references from Mesa):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cc -o demo1 demo1.c -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib \
-lMesaaux -lMesatk -lMesaGL -lXext -lX11 -lm
</pre><p><a href="0174f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1</a> shows the result of
the execution of our program which is exited by pressing the
&lt;ESC&gt; key. This exercise was definitely easier to program
using the Mesa libraries than using X window directly.</p><p><a href="0174f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1. Demo Program
Output</a></p><p>Now, since Mesa is a library for 3D graphics, let's create a
three dimensional object. Replace the <b  >display()</b>
function in our first example with the following calls:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 void display(void)
{
  glClearColor(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
  glColor3f(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
  glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
  glLoadIdentity();
  glOrtho(-1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0);
  glRotatef(45.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  glRotatef(30.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
  auxWireCube(1.0);
  glFlush();
}
</pre><p>Recompile. Instead of using
<b  >glBegin()/glEnd()</b> pairs to specify the vertices
for an object, we now use one of the auxiliary library functions to
draw a wire frame cube. The two <b  >glRotatef()</b>
calls before the drawing change the model view matrix. Since
rotations can only change the model view matrix, we are not
required to switch to the model view matrix mode explicitly; the
switch is made automatically by Mesa. The first call rotates the
object 45 degrees about the Y axis, the second 30 degrees about the
Z axis. The final letter, <b  >f</b>, of
<b  >glRotatef()</b> indicates that its arguments are
floating point. (Functions that end with the letter
<b  >d</b>, <b  >i</b> or <b  >s</b>
accept arguments of type double, integer or short, respectively.)
Internally, Mesa uses the float version of a function; thus,
calling this version directly saves an additional function call
within Mesa. <a href="0174f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2</a> shows the
output generated by running this version of our program.</p><p><a href="0174f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2. Wire Frame
Cube</a></p><p>Next, we add interactivity to our program. To allow an
interactive rotation of our cube, we have only to add some lines
that deal with input:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include&lt;GL/gl.h&gt;
#include&lt;glaux.h&gt;
float xangle=0.0, yangle=0.0;
void display(void)
{
  glClearColor(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
  glColor3f(0.0, 0.0, 0.0);
  glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
  glLoadIdentity();
  glOrtho(-1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0);
  glRotatef(xangle, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
  glRotatef(yangle, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  auxWireCube(1.0);
  glFlush();
}
void rotX1(void)
{
  xangle+=5.;
}
void rotX2(void)
{
  xangle-=5.;
}
void rotY1(void)
{
  yangle+=5.;
}
void rotY2(void)
{
  yangle-=5.;
}
void main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  auxInitDisplayMode(AUX_SINGLE | AUX_RGB);
  auxInitPosition(0, 0, 500, 500);
  auxInitWindow(argv[0]);
  auxKeyFunc(AUX_LEFT, rotX1);
  auxKeyFunc(AUX_RIGHT, rotX2);
  auxKeyFunc(AUX_UP, rotY1);
  auxKeyFunc(AUX_DOWN, rotY2);
  auxMainLoop(display);
}
</pre><p>The <b  >display()</b> function is nearly identical
to the one in the previous example, we have exchanged the hard
coded angle for a variable. Our <b  >main()</b> function
now includes four calls to <b  >auxKeyFunc()</b> allowing
us to specify a callback function that is called when a certain key
is pressed (the constants used here refer to the cursor keys).
Finally, we need functions that will increase or decrease the
rotation angle of the cube depending on which key is pressed. The
program is again compiled in the same manner. When this version of
our program is running, the cube can be rotated by pressing any of
the cursor keys.</p><p><a href="0174s1.html" target="_self">Sidebar: Messa/OpenGL
Resources</a></p><p>We would probably prefer our application to use the mouse to
rotate the cube, but we are currently limited to the functions
provided by the auxiliary library. To undertake writing the program
to use mouse clicks instead of cursor keys would require us to use
one of the more sophisticated X windows interfaces (but thats
another article).</p><p>Finally, we will add some light effects to our cube demo and
show how to remove hidden surfaces. These calculations are also
easily handled by calls to Mesa, and the programmer does not have
to worry about the underlying, non-trivial mathematics. We again
modify the <b  >display()</b> function as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void display(void)
{
  GLfloat light0[4] = {0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 0.0};
  GLfloat color[4]  = {1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0};
  glClearColor(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
  glMaterialfv(GL_FRONT_AND_BACK, GL_DIFFUSE, color);
  glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
  glLoadIdentity();
  glOrtho(-1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0);
  glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
  glLoadIdentity();
  glLightfv(GL_LIGHT0, GL_POSITION, light0);
  glRotatef(xangle, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
  glRotatef(yangle, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  auxSolidCube(1.0);
  glFlush();
}
</pre><p>Since drawing a wire frame cube with lighting enabled does
not make much sense, we will use a solid cube. For a solid cube to
be rendered correctly we need to remove hidden surfaces. In Mesa
this can be accomplished by using the z-buffer which stores
information about the depth value of a point in 3D space. Mesa will
then automatically only draw pixels which are visible. To
initialize the z-buffer prior to the drawing we just add the
constant <b  >GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT</b> to the call to
<b  >glClear()</b>.</p><p>For lighting calculations we cannot simply use a drawing
color&mdash;we have to link a color to an object. Mesa uses
&ldquo;materials&rdquo; to make this link and allows us to specify the
properties of a material. The call to
<b  >glMaterialfv()</b> assigns red as the color for
diffuse reflections to both the front and back sides of all
polygons. We specify the position of the light with a call to
<b  >glLightfv()</b>. Mesa can use a number of different
lights (at least 8 are guaranteed), and the constants
<b  >GL_LIGHT0 ... GL_LIGHT7</b> can be used to reference
them. <b  >GL_POSITION</b> informs Mesa that we are
specifying a position (other possibilities include light and
color), and the vector <b  >light0[]</b> places the light
on the specified axis at infinite distance. This particular axis is
used to achieve different light intensities on the different faces
of the cube. Notice that these two functions show another type of
naming convention&mdash;both names end with the letters
<b  >fv</b>, i.e., the arguments are vectors of floating
point values.</p><p>We also need to modify the <b  >main()</b> function
to include z-buffering and lighting calculations:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  auxInitDisplayMode(AUX_SINGLE | AUX_RGB | AUX_DEPTH);
  auxInitPosition(0, 0, 500, 500);
  auxInitWindow(argv[0]);
  auxKeyFunc(AUX_LEFT, rotX1);
  auxKeyFunc(AUX_RIGHT, rotX2);
  auxKeyFunc(AUX_UP, rotY1);
  auxKeyFunc(AUX_DOWN, rotY2);
  glShadeModel(GL_SMOOTH);
  glEnable(GL_LIGHTING);
  glEnable(GL_LIGHT0);
  glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
  glDepthFunc(GL_LESS);
  auxMainLoop(display);
}
</pre><p>First the constant <b  >AUX_DEPTH</b> in the call
to <b  >auxInitDisplayMode()</b> instructs X windows to
provide a window with a z-buffer. We then use smooth shading
(<b  >glShadeModel()</b>) to draw polygons that have
varying color over the face of the polygon. If we used flat shading
(the default), the different polygons would be clearly visible. Of
course, that would not make a difference in the case of a cube, but
would with other objects (e.g., replace the cube with a cone using
<b  >auxSolidCone(1.0, 1.0)</b> and see the result).
Finally, we enable lighting calculations, <b  >light0</b>
and depth testing using calls to <b  >glEnable()</b>. For
depth testing we specify a function to compare the depth values so
that only smaller values, i.e., closer to the viewer, are
considered. Recompile. The lit, rotatable cube shown in
<a href="0174f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3</a> is the output of our
program after some rotations have been done.</p><p><a href="0174f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3. Rotatable
Cube</a></p><p>We have now covered the basic drawing operations to produce
realistic 3D scenes using Mesa. The auxiliary library used in these
examples is insufficient as an interface to the window system for
larger scale programs. One alternative is to use the GL Utility
Toolkit (GLUT) that transparently provides the same functionality
as Iris GL (e.g., window and event handling, menus). GLUT was
written by Mark Kilgard at Silicon Graphics and is available free.
Another option is to use OpenGL widgets that are provided with the
Mesa package in the widgets subdirectory. (This subdirectory must
be compiled separately.) A program could then do all the windows
and events handling in the normal X fashion and create one or more
OpenGL widgets to display 3D graphics. Drawing into these widgets
can be accomplished using calls to Mesa. As a final example of what
Mesa can do, <a href="0174f4.html" target="_self">Figure 4</a> shows a
rendering of a molecular orbital of benzene using my molecular
graphics program Viewmol. (The OpenGL/Mesa version of Viewmol has
not been released yet, but will appear at the same locations where
the Iris GL version can be found today:
