Randolph Bentson
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Publisher:</b></span> Specialized
Systems Consultants (SSC)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ISBN:</b></span> 0-916151-89-1</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Price:</b></span> $22.00</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Reviewer:</b></span> Richelo
Killian</p><p>The title of this book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Inside Linux: A Look at
Operating System Development</em></span>, is a bit misleading. I was
expecting a book that really digs right into the Linux kernel, and
would give me some insight into why Linux works as great as it
does, but that's not what I found.</p><p>Please don't misinterpret the above paragraph&mdash;Dr. Randolph
Bentson has written an excellent book here. I just think the title
is a bit misleading. Now that I have that off my chest, let's have
a look at what the book <span   class="bold"><b>does</b></span>
offer. The book is divided into three parts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Computing Today</p></li><li><p>The Linux Programmer's View</p></li><li><p>The Advanced User's View</p></li></ul></div><p>Chapter 1 discusses why Linux is becoming more popular,
pointing out both its advantages and its shortcomings, although
even those are looked at from a Linux-fanatic's point of view. This
chapter alone makes buying the book worthwhile, if only as
ammunition to convince your boss you need Linux in your
organization.</p><p>In the next three chapters, Dr Bentson gives a fairly
detailed history of the development of Linux, covering, among other
topics: security rings, the shell, file system, timesharing,
virtual memory, the X client, the X server, scheduling,
synchronization, memory management and kernel security. These
issues are discussed from the initial development of Linux, and why
many of these elements are implemented differently in Linux than in
any other system. Each system element is covered in sufficient
detail, but not so much as to become boring. Dr. Bentson has done
an excellent job of filtering through all the material available
for these different areas of operating system Development, but just
in case there are some people out there who want more information
on one or more of the topics discussed, he includes more than
enough pointers to sites on the Internet to satisfy even the most
avid reader.</p><p>Part II, &ldquo;The Linux Programmer's View&rdquo;, gets a bit deeper
into the actual kernel. Chapter 5 discusses the operating system
kernel, concentrating on issues such as: user interface, process
control, input/output, memory management, security, standards and
&ldquo;bootstrapping the kernel&rdquo;. Each section is full of example code
which better explains the concepts presented. All of this
explanation is done in a mere 80 pages&mdash;I would have liked a more
in-depth discussion of the inner workings of the kernel.</p><p>Chapter 6 looks at the networking side of the kernel and
gives a brief overview of the ISO OSI Model, TCP/IP, UDP/IP and IP
&amp; ICMP. This chapter is very informative, mostly covering
information that can also be found in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Network
Administrator's Guide</em></span>. Part III starts off by looking at
development tools, but does not discuss any specific tools,
concentrating instead on the philosophies behind the tools.</p><p>Chapter 7 discusses languages, editors and file management
tools. Chapter 8 goes into quite a bit of detail on the hardware
supported by the Linux kernel. These chapters would be very useful
to a new user in making decisions as to hardware and software
tools. The book concludes with a quick run-down of available
distributions&mdash;a good reference for someone looking to buy, as long
as the rapid rate of change in software today is kept in mind.
Covered in this last chapter are dual tracked kernel releases,
distribution kits and CD-ROM publishers. Appendix B contains a
concise list of system calls, and Appendix C consists of a nice
time-line of Linux development to date. Overall I would say that
this is an excellent read for the accomplished Unix User. Part II,
however, could be a bit too advanced for the newcomer to
Unix.</p><p>Dr. Bentson emphasizes that the book was written in LaTeX,
and converted to HTML with LaTeX2HTML. It would be nice if SSC
could include the book on CD in HTML format to make following the
URLs easier.</p></div></div>
