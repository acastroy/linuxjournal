<i  >Linux Journal</i> interviewed Larry Gritz of Pixar
Animation Studios on August 16.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Amy</em></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>I understand that you were
a Technical Director for the latest great animation feature film,
</em></span><span   class="bold"><b>Toy Story</b></span>. Can you tell
us what you did in that role?</p><p>LarryI was one of 30 or so technical directors (TDs) who
worked on that film. TD is the job title for people who create the
models, write shaders and light the shots. Essentially, they are
technical folks responsible for the visual look of the film.
Another group, the animators&mdash;typically with classical animation
rather than technical backgrounds&mdash;is responsible for the motion
or acting of the characters. There are also countless other people
writing the story, designing the look, painting, developing
software and so on. In all, it's quite a big team of incredibly
talented people. I came into the project fairly late in the
production, after modeling was mostly done, but I got to work on
shaders and lighting.</p><p>What is your background? How did you get involved with
graphics?</p><p>I started out interested mainly in compilers, but I took a
course in computer graphics when I was an undergraduate at Cornell,
and I've been hooked ever since. I started tinkering around with
writing renderers, and concentrated on graphics in graduate school
at George Washington University, doing my MS thesis about a new way
of calculating a particular kind of light propagation. I stayed for
a PhD (which I am still in the process of wrapping up), doing more
research in animation techniques, among other things.</p><p>Can you tell us about your Blue Moon Rendering Tools
software?</p><p>BMRT is a high quality renderer which supports ray tracing
and radiosity, area lights, volumetric effects and other advanced
features. It runs on several Unix platforms, including SGI, Sun,
HP, NEXTSTEP, and of course, Linux. It's cheap shareware, and is
free for academic and non-commercial usage. Features that set it
apart from most other renderers include support of curved high
level surfaces such as bicubic patches and trimmed NURBS, good
anti-aliasing support and programmable shading (users can write
little programs called &ldquo;shaders&rdquo; which control the appearances of
surfaces and lights). These features aren't found in many renderers
(including big commercial packages), but they are essential to
high-end, professional quality rendering.</p><p>BMRT is fully compliant with the RenderMan Interface
Specification, developed by Pixar. RenderMan is a standard way for
modelers to talk to renderers, sort of like PostScript, but for
describing 3-D photo-realistic scenes. By being RenderMan
compliant, BMRT is largely compatible with Pixar's PhotoRealistic
RenderMan product (PRMan, for short), which is probably the most
commonly used renderer for feature film effects work (and of
course, was used to render <span   class="emphasis"><em>Toy Story</em></span>).</p><p>BMRT is not particularly easy to use; it's really more of a
developer's product. But it's extremely powerful&mdash;much more so
than any of the other free renderers out on the net, which are more
oriented toward hobbyists.</p><p>The BMRT home page,
<a href="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html" target="_self">www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html</a>,
has several pictures that have been rendered using my
software.</p><p>Why did you pick Linux as a platform for Blue Moon?</p><p>A couple of years ago, I was introduced to Linux by Youngser
Park, a fellow graduate student at GWU. He asked me to port BMRT to
Linux so that he and other students could run the renderer (as well
as our other lab tools) at home. I remember the first time I was at
his place and saw Linux running on his computer. I'd heard of Linux
before, but never imagined that it could be a robust
implementation. When I saw X11 running and realized how easy it was
to set up an environment just like I was used to on the SGI, I knew
I needed to be running it on my home machine, as well.</p><p>What are some interesting projects where the BMRT have
been/are used? Is BMRT a popular package? Do you know of any
studios that use it running under Linux?</p><p>BMRT is fairly popular in the high end. It's rather hard for
beginners to use, so it doesn't come close to say, POV-Ray, in
terms of the number of people who use it. But because it's so
powerful, and RenderMan compliant, it's gotten noticed by a lot of
production houses. Judging by the mail I receive, several
well-known studios have at least tried it out. Pixar's renderer is
much faster, and is less prone to some very subtle artifacts, so no
studios would want to use my software instead of PRMan. But since
the algorithms are very different, many houses use them
together&mdash;PRMan for the bulk of the work, and BMRT for those pesky
scenes when they just have to have ray tracing or area lights or
something. I can't name the studios, but I know BMRT has been used
for a couple TV commercials and for an episode of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star
Trek: Voyager</em></span>. I don't think it's been used for final
frames of any feature films yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if
that happened soon.</p><p>I don't know any studios currently using Linux
&ldquo;officially&rdquo;, but many people who work at production houses run
Linux at home and like to be able to continue to tinker with
shaders and such.</p><p>How do you think Linux compares to other platforms?</p><p>I think it's a more robust Unix-like OS than many I've seen
from the big commercial workstation vendors. I also like the spirit
of community and the kind of high-quality, low cost software that
is available for Linux. I've tried to contribute to that with the
availability of my software for Linux.</p><p>Do you think your decision to offer a commercial
graphical/rendering tool for Linux will inspire others to make more
packages available?</p><p>I hope so. With high end Intel chips being a very
cost-effective way to get lots of computational power, I wouldn't
be surprised to see studios using large farms of Intel-based
hardware for their rendering or other graphics tasks. If this is
the case, I'd much rather see these machines running Linux than
NT.</p><p>And in the vein of Barbara Walters, if you had to be one
character in <span   class="bold"><b>Toy Story</b></span>, who would
you be?</p><p>Probably Sid, though perhaps without the sadistic streak. I
like the tinkerer in him. He has sort of a God complex, but he sure
does make interesting toys.</p><p>Note that RenderMan is a registered trademark of Pixar, and
<span   class="bold"><b>Toy Story</b></span> is registered and

RenderMan Companion</b></span> by Steve Upstill (Addison-Wesley,
