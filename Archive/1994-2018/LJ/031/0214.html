    We take the tag line on the cover (&ldquo;The Monthly
    Magazine of the Linux Community&rdquo;) seriously.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ca580.0x15c2138"></a></h2></div></div><p>While I have never run a railroad, I am
guessing that publishing a magazine is like running a railroad. You
have an assortment of diverse customer needs, you have a limited
budget, and you need to offer the best possible service to
everyone.
</p><p>But the parallel goes beyond that. In the railroad business
you can make up your train out of an assortment of different cars,
and based on the number of cars and the terrain you must travel
through, you can pick the number of engines to pull it. As
publisher of <i  >LJ</i>, I get to pick the article
mix, pick the number of pages, and pick who receives the magazine.
If I do my job right, <i  >LJ</i> gets more customers,
which gets it more revenue&mdash;revenue from advertisers as well as
readers&mdash;and everyone benefits.</p><p>All that said, I want to tell you what has changed at
<i  >LJ</i>, why it has changed and what you will see
in the future. And, for our old customers, I want to assure you
that you will continue to get the service you expect.</p><p>We take the tag line on the cover (&ldquo;The Monthly Magazine of
the Linux Community&rdquo;) seriously. I fought for this before Issue 1
was published, and I continue to fight to make sure we stay on
track. Today, however, that community is changing and we need to
respond to those changes. While there is still a large Linux
development community, there are other easily-identifiable
&ldquo;communities&rdquo; needing a reliable source of Linux information.
Here are a few:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Applications developers</p></li><li><p>ISPs</p></li><li><p>Linux (and Unix) novices</p></li><li><p>Web developers</p></li><li><p>Embedded systems builders</p></li></ul></div><p>Let's take one example, web developers, and see why it is
important that we give them the information they need. Linux is an
ideal platform for developing web content and Linux systems make
ideal web servers. But web developers have choices. When someone
says, &ldquo;Why should I use Linux instead of NT for my web server?&rdquo;
we need to have a good answer. Being able to point at books like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>CGI Programming in C &amp; Perl</em></span>, by Thomas
Boutell, a Linux user himself, helps. Being able to show the person
that a monthly magazine called <i  >Linux Journal</i>
will answer ongoing questions, offer sources for essential hardware
and software, and generally offer needed support is another
important part of the answer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ca580.0x15c2920"></a>What's Changing?</h2></div><div><h2 class="subtitle">Linux Gazette</h2></div></div><p>The first major change is that we are taking over the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>. For those of you not familiar
with it, <span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> is a newsletter.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> has offered an assortment of quick tips and
articles that, while useful, have appealed to a smaller segment of
the Linux community. We have always considered their work to be
complementary to ours.
</p><p>John Fisk, the creator of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gazette</em></span>,
has run out of time to produce it and we struck a deal whereby
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LG</em></span> can continue as a vendor-independent source
of information. Its new home will be http://www.ssc.com/lg/, and
its new editor will be Marjorie Richardson. She can be reached at
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>.</p><p>In addition, a new editor and a new home, there will be other
changes to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gazette</em></span>. While we will continue
to offer an on-line version, we intend to include part of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Gazette</em></span> in the pages of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. We will offer the information we consider of
the greatest interest, and pointers to additional on-line
information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ca580.0x15c2e48"></a>Novice-to-Novice</h2></div></div><p>The way our community grows is by getting new people up to
speed. We used to have a novice column. It just sort of faded away.
We knew it was needed and with the introduction of
&ldquo;Novice-to-Novice&rdquo;, we've done something about it. John Fisk is
writing some articles for the series, as well as at least one other
author. You can suggest new topics by sending e-mail to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a> or by
writing to us.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ca580.0x15c2fa8"></a>Tech Answers</h2></div></div><p>When each new Linux distribution comes out there is a flood
of new questions. We have started a tech answers column where
vendors and consultants will answer the common questions that
arise. If you have a question, you can send it to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>, mail it in
or fill out a form on our web page.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ca580.0x15c3108"></a>More product reviews</h2></div></div><p>The most common question for a beginner is: &ldquo;What should I
buy?&rdquo; For someone who has been working with Linux for some time,
this is a common question as well&mdash;the query is just more likely to
be about an ISDN board or scanner than a Linux distribution. We are
encouraging vendors to send us products to review and hope to keep
up with the new product releases so we can help you make product
selections.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ca580.0x15c3210"></a>More pages</h2></div></div><p>Finally, we are producing a larger magazine. That means we
will have more space for the new columns and more reviews. What
makes this possible is more income. We are growing as fast as we
can right now, but we need you to do your part. Buy your boss a
subscription. Tell a fellow Linux user about us. And when you buy
something for Linux tell the vendor that you found out about him in
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. That's the way it all happens.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ca580.0x15c3370"></a>And more</h2></div></div><p>We have other changes in the works as well. Watch for
information on them in the December issue, or watch for news
flashes on our web site. With your help we can continue to be the
Linux resource you need as well as a tool that helps show others
that Linux has become a real part of the computing industry.
