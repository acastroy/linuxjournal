    The Linux-CGI Project goals are explained&mdash;what it intends

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a85580.0x1b7d7c0"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>In this article, we will explain the intentions and goals of
the Linux-GGI Project along with the basic concepts used by the GGI
programmers to allow fast, easy to use access to graphical
services, hide hardware level issues from applications and
introduce extensible support for multiple displays under Linux. The
Linux-GGI project wants to set up a General Graphical Interface for
Linux that will allow easy use of graphical hardware and input
facilities under the Linux OS. Already existing solutions and
standards like X or OpenGL do deal with graphic's issues, but these
current implementations under Linux have several (sometimes
serious) drawbacks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Console switching is not deadlock-free, because the
kernel asks a user-mode application to permit the switch causing a
problem in terms of security. Since
<span   class="bold"><b>any</b></span> user-mode application can lock
the console, the kernel has to rely on the application to allow a
user-invoked switch. For stand-alone machines, if the console locks
in an application without a switch, a system reboot will have to be
done.</p></li><li><p>The Secure Attention Key (SAK), which kills all
processes associated to the current virtual console might help with
the above problem, but for graphics applications the machine might
still remain locked, because the kernel has no way to do a proper
reset of the console&mdash;after all, it has no idea which video
hardware is present.</p></li><li><p>Any application accessing graphical hardware at a
low level has to be trusted as it
<span   class="bold"><b>needs</b></span> to be run by root to gain
access to the graphical hardware. The kernel relies on the
application to restore the hardware state when a console switch is
initiated. Relying on the application might be okay for an X server
that needs superuser rights for other reasons, but most of us would
not want to trust a game that is available to us only in binary
form.</p></li><li><p>Input hardware (such as a mouse or a joystick) can
be accessed using the current approach, but it can't easily be
shared between several virtual consoles and the applications using
it.</p></li><li><p>No clean way is available to use more than one
keyboard and monitor combination. You might think that this is not
possible on PC hardware anyway; but in fact, with currently
existing hardware there are ways to have multi-headed PCs, and the
USB peripheral bus to be introduced soon may allow for multiple
keyboards, etc. Besides, other architectures do support multiple
displays, and if Linux did also, it would be a good reason to use
Linux for applications like CAD/CAE technology.</p></li><li><p>Games cannot use the existing hardware at maximum
performance, because they either have to use X, which introduces a
big overhead (from a game programmer's point of view), and/or
access the hardware directly, which requires separate drivers for
every type of hardware they run on.</p></li></ul></div><p>GGI addresses all these points and several more in a clean
and extensible way. (GGI does not wish to be a substitute for these
existing standards nor does it want to implement its graphical
services completely inside the kernel.) Now, let's have a look at
the concepts of GGI&mdash;some of which have already been implemented
and have shown their usability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a85580.0x1b7de48"></a>Video Hardware Driver</h2></div></div><p>The GGI hardware driver consists of a kernel space module
called Kernel Graphical Interface (KGI) and a user space library
called libGGI. The KGI part of GGI will consist of a display
manager that takes care of accessing multiple video cards and does
MMU-supported page flipping on older hardware. This method allows
for incredibly fast access to the frame buffer from user space
whenever possible. (This technique has already been proven&mdash;the
GO32 graphics library for DJPGG, the GNU-C-compiler for DOS, uses
this method and has astonishingly fast graphical support on older
hardware.) If this memory-mapped access method can be used in GGI,
there will be no loss in performance as the application reads or
writes the pixel buffer directly.</p><p>Each type of video card in the system has its own driver, a
simple loadable module that registers as many displays as the card
can address. (Video cards exist that support two monitors or a
monitor and a TV screen.) The driver module gives the system the
information needed to access the frame buffer and to access special
accelerated features, the setup of a certain video mode and the
limits of the hardware (e.g., the graphic card, the monitor, and
any other part of the display system). The module can either be
obtained from a single source file or be linked using precompiled
subdrivers for each graphical hardware subsystem (ramdac, monitor,
clock chip, chipset, accelerator engine). This last option is the
favourite approach, since it allows support for new cards to be
added quite easily, as only the subdrivers for hardware not already
supported need to be implemented and tested. (The others are
already in use or bug fixes there will improve all drivers using
them.) This scheme has been used to derive support for many of the
S3 accelerator-based cards, and has proved to be very efficient and
easy to use. It also allows for efficient simultaneous development
for several graphic cards. The subdrivers to be linked together are
now selected at configuration time, but they can also be selected
after automatic detection or according to a database (not yet
built). Note that the subdrivers do not need to be in source form;
as a result, precompiled subdriver object files can be linked
together during installation.</p><p>As each subdriver knows the hardware exactly, it can prevent
the display hardware from being damaged due to a bad configuration
and make suggestions about the optimal use of the hardware. For
example, the current implementation has drivers for fixed- and
multisync monitors that allow optimal timings for any resolution to
be calculated on the fly without any further configuration. Of
course, completely user- configurable drivers are also possible. In
short, in addition to the hardware level code, the subsystem
drivers provide as much information about the hardware as possible.
This way the kernel will have sufficient methods to initialize the
card, to reset consoles and video modes when an application gets
terminated, and to make optimal use of the hardware. The KGI
manager will allow a single kernel image to support GGI on all
hardware, as any hardware-specific code is in the loadable module
and only common services (such as memory mapping code) are provided
from the kernel. The KGI manager will also provide data structures
and support to almost any imaginable kind of input devices.</p><p>The user space library, called libGGI, will implement an
abstract programming interface to applications. It interfaces to
the kernel part using special device files and standard file
operations. Applications should use this interface (or APIs
provided by applications based on it) to gain maximum performance;
however, other APIs can be built accessing the special files
directly. Understand that in this case the X server will just be a
normal application in terms of graphic access. Since X is
considered to be the main customer for graphical services, the API
will be designed according to the X protocol definition and will
implement a set of low level drawing routines required by X
servers. The library will use accelerated functions whenever
possible and emulate features not efficiently supported by the
hardware found. An important feature of future generation graphical
hardware is 3D acceleration which easily fits into the GGI point of
view. We plan to provide support for 3D features based on MESA,
which is close to OpenGL and ensures compatibility with other
platforms than Linux.</p><p>Another issue when dealing with graphics is game programming
as games need the highest possible performance. They also need
special support by the video hardware to produce flicker-free
animation or realistic images. The current approaches can't support
this need in a reasonable way, since they cannot get help from the
kernel (e.g., to use retrace interrupts). GGI can provide this
support easily and give maximum hardware support to all
applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a85580.0x1b7e0b0"></a>Input Hardware Driver</h2></div></div><p>There are many ways to interact with computers&mdash;a keyboard, a
mouse, even a cybersuit. All of these methods have special
protocols to report user actions and even need special hardware to
be accessed. GGI will allow any kind of input to be supported
without recompiling the kernel for each new device, thus allowing
for flexibility and easy configuration. This support is achieved by
having a loadable module for each device or device class. Just like
the video card drivers, any input device driver will register
abstract input devices that convert user actions to events.</p><p>For example, an application might query for the registered
devices and select the events it wants to receive, so that a game
program could default to use joysticks or keyboard input depending
on the environment. Installing a game or an X server will not
require any further configuration other than copying the binary to
its destination directory and starting it. Please note that this
methodology will also considerably reduce the effort required to
maintain several differently-equipped machines as the application
binaries will be the same for all machines and can be shared via
network file systems. Only the GGI modules to be loaded will differ
from machine to machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a85580.0x1b7e210"></a>A New Way of Understanding Consoles</h2></div></div><p>GGI defines a console as a pair&mdash;a display and a (mandatory)
character input device. Optionally, other input facilities like a
pointing device or controllers attached to a console may be
present. The display is capable of providing alphanumeric data or
graphics while the character device provides character input (just
as the name implies). We use these diffuse terms as the display
actually might be something other than a monitor, e.g., braille
lines or other devices that help disabled or handicapped people to
work with computers. Similarly, the input might be a keyboard or a
voice recognition program or hardware&mdash;just about anything you can
imagine. However, the character input device is mandatory, because
it focuses on one and only one virtual console that is shown on one
of the displays registered by the loaded modules. Any other devices
are associated with one of the keyboards, and any user activity is
reported to applications running on the focused console. Thus, it
is not only possible to have multiple virtual consoles but also (in
conjunction with multiple displays) to have several real
consoles.</p><p>If the user wants to switch between two virtual consoles, the
keyboard driver will tell the KGI manager to bring the specified
virtual console on the display assigned to it and then report any
keyboard, pointer and controller events to the application. One
problem arising from the virtualization is that an application
accessing accelerated features might first have to terminate the
current command or that the frame buffer needs to be preserved even
if the application goes into background mode. GGI will effectively
hide this operation from the application. Applications can be
placed into one of the following categories with examples
given:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The application can redraw its screen without
noticeable overhead at any given time, e.g., X server.</p></li><li><p>The application can be programmed considerably more
easily when a back-up buffer is provided in case the frame buffer
needs to be accessible at any time, e.g., a ray tracer or any other
program that needs to do a lot of calculations to draw an image.
This back-up would also allow running the application in background
mode while continuing to draw to its frame buffer.</p></li><li><p>The application can skip output or simply sleep, if
not in foreground mode, thereby reducing system load significantly,
e.g., games or software video decoders. SVGALIB works in this
manner.</p></li></ul></div><p>Class one and three are easy to virtualize&mdash;they just have to
redraw their buffers when switched to foreground mode, and
therefore, when switching to background mode, the screen contents
are discarded and drawing requests are ignored. The only difficult
class is class two. However, since the kernel knows the exact state
of the hardware, it can tell a user space daemon to allocate
sufficient memory, save the frame buffer there, redirect the memory
mapping of the application and tell the library to use optimized
drawing methods for memory- mapped buffers instead of accelerated
drawing functions.</p><p>GGI plans to add powerful graphical hardware support to the
Linux operating system. As with any hardware driver, it needs to
have a kernel segment that is kept to a minimum (currently the
modules are about 30K in size, and should not become greater than
80K). If accepted by the Linux community, GGI can provide a clean
method of dealing with multiple display and input hardware as well
as an architecture-independent programming interface that will give
good performance on any platform. Also, it will allow hardware
manufacturers to provide optimized drivers for their hardware if
they wish. During development much care has been and will continue
to be taken to isolate machine or hardware-dependent code, whenever
possible, in order to provide good portability.</p><p><a href="0160s1.html" target="_self">Sidebar: Linux-GGI Project
Resources</a></p><p>As GGI is still under development, several features are not
yet implemented, but there is a first implementation that
demonstrates that our concepts are capable of providing easy access
to video hardware and solving all of the points addressed in this
article. Currently being worked on is support for multiple displays
and libGGI. Of course, introducing a new concept to the kernel to
access video hardware will cause several (non-X) applications to be
incompatible, but on the other hand, adding this concept will ease
the configuration of Linux, and open up new vistas to game
programmers with an operating system and graphical support that
will allow maximum performance on any system.</p></div></div>
