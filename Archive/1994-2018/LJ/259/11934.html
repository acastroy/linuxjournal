And, how does it compare to what we've already experienced with Linux and
open source?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab6580.0x2bae300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I was in the buzz-making business long before I learned how it was done.
That happened here, at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. Some of it I learned by watching
kernel developers make Linux so useful that it became irresponsible for
anybody doing serious development not to consider it&mdash;and, eventually,
not to use it. Some I learned just by doing my job here. But most of it I
learned by watching the term &ldquo;open source&rdquo; get adopted by the world, and
participating as a journalist in the process.
</p><p>
For a view of how quickly &ldquo;open source&rdquo; became popular, see Figure 1 for a
look at what Google's
Ngram viewer shows.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11934f1.large.jpg"><img src="11934f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Google Ngram Viewer: &ldquo;open source&rdquo;
</p></div></div><p>
Ngram plots how often a term appears in books. It goes only to 2008, but
the picture is clear enough.
</p><p>
I suspect that curve's hockey stick began to angle toward the vertical on 
February 8, 1998. That was when Eric S. Raymond (aka ESR),
published an open
letter titled &ldquo;Goodbye, 'free software'; hello, 'open source'&rdquo;
and made sure
it got plenty of coverage. The letter leveraged Netscape's announcement
two weeks earlier that it would release the source code to what would
become the Mozilla browser, later called Firefox. Eric wrote:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It's crunch
time, people. The Netscape announcement changes everything. We've broken
out of the little corner we've been in for twenty years. We're in a whole
new game now, a bigger and more exciting one&mdash;and one I think we can
win.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Which we did.
</p><p>
How? Well, official bodies, such as the Open Source Initiative (OSI), were
founded. (See Resources for a link to more history of the OSI.) O'Reilly published books and
convened conferences. We wrote a lot about it at the time and haven't
stopped (this piece being one example of that). But the prime mover was
Eric himself, whom Christopher Locke describes as &ldquo;a rhetorician of the
first water&rdquo;.
</p><p>
To put this in historic context, the dot-com mania was at high ebb in 1998
and 1999, and both Linux and open source played huge roles in that. Every
Linux World Expo was lavishly funded and filled by optimistic start-ups
with booths of all sizes and geeks with fun new jobs. At one of those,
more than 10,000 attended an SRO talk by Linus. At the Expos and other
gatherings, ESR held packed rooms in rapt attention, for hours, while he
held forth on Linux, the hacker ethos and much more. But his main
emphasis was on open source, and the need for hackers and their employers
to adopt its code and methods&mdash;which they did, in droves. (Let's also
remember that two of the biggest IPOs in history were Red Hat's and VA
Linux's, in August and December 1999.)
</p><p>
Ever since witnessing those success stories, I have been alert to memes and
how they spread in the technical world. Especially &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; (see Figure
2). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11934f2.large.jpg"><img src="11934f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Google Trends: &ldquo;big data&rdquo;
</p></div></div><p>
What happened in 2011? Did Big Data spontaneously combust? Was there a
campaign of some kind? A coordinated set of campaigns?
</p><p>
Though I can't prove it (at least not in the time I have), I believe the
main cause was &ldquo;Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and
productivity&rdquo;, published by McKinsey in May 2011, to much fanfare. That
report, and following ones by McKinsey, drove publicity in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Forbes</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Economist</em></span>, various O'Reilly pubs, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Financial
Times</em></span> and many others&mdash;while providing ample sales fodder for every big vendor selling Big Data
products and services.
</p><p>
Among those big vendors, none did a better job of leveraging and generating
buzz than IBM. See Resources for the results of a Google search for IBM +
&ldquo;Big Data&rdquo;, for the calendar
years 2010&ndash;2011. Note that the first publication listed in that search,
&ldquo;Bringing
big data to the Enterprise&rdquo;, is dated May 16, 2011, the same month as the
McKinsey report. The next, &ldquo;IBM Big Data - Where do I start?&rdquo; is
dated November 23, 2011.
</p><p>
Figure 3 shows a Google Trends graph for McKinsey, IBM and &ldquo;big
data&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11934f3.large.jpg"><img src="11934f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Google Trends: &ldquo;IBM big data&rdquo;, &ldquo;McKinsey big
data&rdquo;
</p></div></div><p>
See that bump for IBM in late 2010 in Figure 3? That was due to a lot of push on IBM's
part, which you can see in a search for IBM and big data just in
2010&mdash;and a search just for big data. So there was clearly something in the water
already. But searches, as we see, didn't pick up until 2011. That's when
the craze hit the marketplace, as we see in a search for IBM and 
four other big data vendors (Figure 4). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11934f4.large.jpg"><img src="11934f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Google Trends: &ldquo;IBM big data&rdquo;, &ldquo;SAP big
data&rdquo;, &ldquo;HP big data&rdquo;, &ldquo;Oracle
big data&rdquo;, &ldquo;Microsoft big data&rdquo;
</p></div></div><p>
So, although we may not have a clear enough answer for the cause, we do
have clear evidence of the effects.
</p><p>
Next question: to whom do those companies sell their Big Data stuff? At the
very least, it's the CMO, or Chief Marketing Officer&mdash;a title that
didn't come into common use until the dot-com boom and got huge after
that, as marketing's share of corporate overhead went up and up. On
February 12, 2012, for example, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Forbes</em></span> ran a story
titled &ldquo;Five Years From
Now, CMOs Will Spend More on IT Than CIOs Do&rdquo;. It begins:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Marketing is now a fundamental driver of IT purchasing, and that trend
shows no signs of stopping&mdash;or even slowing down&mdash;any time soon.
In fact, Gartner analyst Laura McLellan recently predicted that by 2017,
CMOs will spend more on IT than their counterpart CIOs.
</p><p>
At first, that prediction may sound a bit over the top. (In just five years
from now, CMOs are going to be spending more on IT than CIOs do?) But,
consider this: 1) as we all know, marketing is becoming increasingly
technology-based; 2) harnessing and mastering Big Data is now key to
achieving competitive advantage; and 3) many marketing budgets already are
larger&mdash;and faster growing&mdash;than IT budgets.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In June 2012, IBM's index page was headlined, &ldquo;Meet the new Chief
Executive Customer. That's who's driving the new science of
marketing.&rdquo; The
copy was directly addressed to the CMO. In response, I wrote &ldquo;Yes, please
meet the Chief Executive Customer&rdquo;, which challenged some of IBM's pitch at
the time. (I'm glad I quoted what I did in that post, because all but one
of the links now go nowhere. The one that works redirects from the original
page to &ldquo;Emerging trends, tools and tech guidance for the data-driven
CMO&rdquo;.)
</p><p>
According to Wikibon, IBM was the top Big Data vendor by 2013, raking in
$1.368 billion in revenue. In February of this year (2015), Reuters reported that
IBM &ldquo;is targeting $40 billion in annual revenue from the cloud, big data,
security and other growth areas by 2018&rdquo;, and that this &ldquo;would represent
about 44 percent of $90 billion in total revenue that analysts expect from
IBM in 2018&rdquo;.
</p><p>
So I'm sure all the publicity works. I am also sure there is a mania to it,
especially around the wanton harvesting of personal data by all means
possible, for marketing purposes. Take a look at &ldquo;The Big
Datastillery&rdquo;,
co-published by IBM and Aberdeen, which depicts this system at work (see
Resources). I
wrote about it in my September 2013 EOF, titled &ldquo;Linux vs.
Bullshit&rdquo;. The
&ldquo;datastillery&rdquo; depicts human beings as beakers on a conveyor belt being fed
marketing goop and releasing gases for the &ldquo;datastillery&rdquo; to process into
more marketing goop. The degree to which it demeans and insults our
humanity is a measure of how insane marketing mania, drunk on a diet of Big
Data, has become.
</p><p>
T.Rob Wyatt, an alpha geek and IBM veteran, doesn't challenge what I say
about the timing of the Big Data buzz rise or the manias around its use as
a term. But he does point out that Big Data is truly different in kind from
its predecessor buzzterms (such as Data Processing) and how it deserves
some respect:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The term Big Data in its original sense represented a complete reversal of
the prevailing approach to data. Big Data specifically refers to the
moment in time when the value of keeping the data exceeded the cost and the
prevailing strategy changed from purging data to retaining it.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
He adds:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
CPU cycles, storage and bandwidth are now so cheap that the cost of
selecting which data to omit exceeds the cost of storing it all and mining
it for value later. It doesn't even have to be valuable today, we can just
store data away on speculation, knowing that only a small portion of it
eventually needs to return value in order to realize a profit. Whereas we
used to ruthlessly discard data, today we relentlessly hoard it; even if
we don't know what the hell to do with it. We just know that whatever data
element we discard today will be the one we really need tomorrow when the
new crop of algorithms comes out.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Which gets me to the story of Bill Binney, a former analyst with the NSA.
His specialty with the agency was getting maximum results from minimum
data, by recognizing patterns in the data. One example of that approach was
ThinThread, a system he and his colleagues developed at the NSA for
identifying patterns indicating likely terrorist activity. ThinThread,
Binney believes, would have identified the 9/11 hijackers, had the program
not been discontinued three weeks before the attacks. Instead, the NSA
favored more expensive programs based on gathering and hoarding the largest
possible sums of data from everywhere, which makes it all the harder to
analyze. His point: you don't find better needles in bigger haystacks.
</p><p>
Binney resigned from the NSA after ThinThread was canceled and has had a
contentious relationship with the agency ever since. I've had the privilege
of spending some time with him, and I believe he is A Good American&mdash;the
title of an upcoming documentary about him. I've seen a pre-release
version, and I recommend seeing it when it hits the theaters.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, I'm wondering when and how the Big
Data craze will run out&mdash;or if it ever will.
</p><p>
My bet is that it will, for three reasons.
</p><p>
First, a huge percentage of Big Data work is devoted to marketing, and
people in the marketplace are getting tired of being both the sources of
Big Data and the targets of marketing aimed by it. They're rebelling by
blocking ads and tracking at growing rates. Given the size of this
appetite, other prophylactic technologies are sure to follow. For example,
Apple is adding &ldquo;Content Blocking&rdquo; capabilities to its mobile Safari
browser. This lets developers provide ways for users to block ads and
tracking on their IOS devices, and to do it at a deeper level than the
current add-ons. Naturally, all of this is freaking out the
surveillance-driven marketing business known as &ldquo;adtech&rdquo; (as a search for
adtech + adblock reveals).
</p><p>
Second, other corporate functions must be getting tired of marketing
hogging so much budget, while earning customer hate in the marketplace.
After years of winning budget fights among CXOs, expect CMOs to start
losing a few&mdash;or more.
</p><p>
Third, marketing is already looking to pull in the biggest possible data
cache of all, from the Internet of Things. Here's T.Rob again:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
IoT device vendors will sell their data to shadowy aggregators who live in
the background (&ldquo;...we may share with our affiliates...&rdquo;). These are
companies that provide just enough service so the customer-facing vendor
can say the aggregator is a necessary part of their business, hence an
affiliate or partner.
</p><p>
The aggregators will do something resembling &ldquo;big data&rdquo; but generally are
more interested in state than trends (I'm guessing at that based on current
architecture) and will work on very specialized data sets of actual
behavior seeking not merely to predict but rather to manipulate behavior in
the immediate short term future (minutes to days). Since the algorithms and
data sets differ greatly from those in the past, the name will change. The
pivot will be the development of new specialist roles in gathering,
aggregating, correlating, and analyzing the datasets.
</p><p>
This is only possible because our current regulatory regime allows all new
data tech by default. If we can, then we should. There is no accountability
of where the data goes after it leaves the customer-facing vendor's hands.
There is no accountability of data gathered about people who are not
account holders or members of a service.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I'm betting that both customers and non-marketing parts of companies are
going to fight that.
</p><p>
Finally, I'm concerned about what I see in Figure 5. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11934f5.large.jpg"><img src="11934f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Google Trends: &ldquo;open source&rdquo;, &ldquo;big
data&rdquo;
</p></div></div><p>
If things go the way Google Trends expects, next year open source and big
data will attract roughly equal interest from those using search engines.
This might be meaningless, or it might be meaningful. I dunno. What do you
think?
