<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #259, November 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>NMI</b></span> (non-masking interrupt) system in Linux has been a notorious
patchwork for a long time, and <span   class="bold"><b>Andy
Lutomirski</b></span> recently decided to try to
clean it up. NMIs occur when something's wrong with the hardware underlying
a running system. Typically in those cases, the NMI attempts to preserve
user data and get the system into as orderly a state as possible, before
an inevitable crash.
</p><p>
Andy felt that in the current NMI code, there were various corner cases and
security holes that needed to be straightened out, but the way to go about
doing so was not obvious. For example, sometimes an NMI could legitimately be
triggered within another NMI, in which case the interrupt code would need
to know that it had been called from &ldquo;NMI context&rdquo; rather than from regular
kernel space. But, the best way to detect NMI context was not so easy to
determine.
</p><p>
Also, Andy saw no way around a significant speed cost, if his goal were to
account for all possible corner cases. On the other hand, allowing some
relatively acceptable level of incorrectness would let the kernel blaze
along at a fast clip. Should he focus on maximizing speed or guaranteeing
correctness?
</p><p>
He submitted some patches, favoring the more correct approach, but this was
actually shot down by <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>. Linus wanted to favor speed over
correctness if at all possible, which meant analyzing the specific problems
that a less correct approach would introduce. Would any of them lead to
real problems, or would the issues be largely ignorable?
</p><p>
As Linus put it, for example, there was one case where it was theoretically
possible for bad code to loop over infinitely recursing NMIs, causing the
stack to grow without bound. But, the code to do that would have no use
whatsoever, so any code that did it would be buggy anyway. So, Linus saw
no need for Andy's patches to guard against that possibility.
</p><p>
Going further, Linus said the simplest approach would be to disallow nested
NMIs&mdash;this would save the trouble of having to guess whether code was in
NMI context, and it would save all the other usual trouble associated
with nesting call stacks.
</p><p>
Problem solved! Except, not really. Andy and others proved reluctant to go
along with Linus' idea. Not because it would cause any problems within the
kernel, but because it would require discarding certain breakpoints that
might be encountered in the code. If the kernel discarded breakpoints
needed by the <span   class="bold"><b>GDB debugger</b></span>, it would make
GDB useless for debugging the kernel.
</p><p>
Andy dug a bit deeper into the code in an effort to come up with a way to
avoid NMI recursion, while simultaneously avoiding disabling just those
breakpoints needed by GDB. Finally, he came up with a solution that was
acceptable to Linus: only in-kernel breakpoints would be discarded. User
breakpoints, such as those set by the GDB user program, still could be
kept.
</p><p>
The NMI code has been super thorny and messed up. But in general, it seems
like more and more of the super-messed-up stuff is being addressed by
kernel developers. The NMI code is a case in point. After years of
fragility and inconsistency, it's on the verge of becoming much cleaner and
more predictable.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: If You're Not Using This, Then Do That</h2>

The &ldquo;If This Then That&rdquo; site has been around for a long time, but if you
haven't checked it out in a while, you owe it to yourself to do so. The
Android app (which had a recent name change to simply &ldquo;IF&rdquo;) makes it
easy to manipulate on the fly, and you're still able to interact with
your account on its Web site. The beauty of IFTTT is its ability to
work without any user interaction.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11937androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11937androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
I have recipes set up that notify me when someone adds a file into a
shared Dropbox folder, which is far more convenient than constantly
checking manually. I also manage all my social network postings with
IFTTT, so if I post a photo via Instagram or want to send a text
update to Facebook and Twitter, all my social networking channels are
updated. In fact, IFTTT even allows you to cross-post Instagram photos
to Twitter and have them show up as native Twitter images.
</p><p>
If you're not using IFTTT to automate your life, you need to head
over to <a href="http://ifttt.com" target="_self">ifttt.com</a> and start now. If you're already using it,
you should download the Android app, which has an incredible interface
to the already awesome IFTTT back end. Get it at the Play Store today;
just search for &ldquo;IF&rdquo; or &ldquo;IFTTT&rdquo;&mdash;either will find the app.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Install Windows? Yeah, Open Source Can Do That.</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #259, November 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For my day job, I occasionally have to demonstrate concepts in a Windows
environment. The most time-consuming part of the process is almost always
the installation. Don't get me wrong; Linux takes a long time to install,
but in order to set up a multi-system lab of Windows computers, it can
take days!
</p><p>
Thankfully, the folks over at <a href="https://automatedlab.codeplex.com" target="_self">https://automatedlab.codeplex.com</a> have
created an open-source program that automatically will set up an entire
lab of servers, including domain controllers, user accounts, trust
relationships and all the other Windows things I tend to forget after
going through the process manually. Because it's script-based, there are
lots of pre-configured lab options ready to click and install. Whether
you need a simple two-server lab or a complex farm with redundant domain
controllers, Automated Lab can do the heavy lifting.
</p><p>
Although the tool is open source, the Microsoft licenses are not. You need
to have the installation keys and ISO files in place before you can
build the labs. Still, the amount of time and headaches you can save
with Automated Lab makes it well worth the download and configuration,
especially if you need to build test labs on a regular basis.

If you've ever dropped Mentos in a bottle of Coke with kids or grown
your own rock candy in a jar with string, you know how excited children
get when doing science. For some of us, that fascination never goes
away, which is why things like Maker Faire exist. If you want your
children (or someone else's children) to grow into awesome nerds,
one of the best things you can do is get them involved with projects
at <a href="http://www.makershed.com" target="_self">www.makershed.com</a>.
</p><p>
Although it's true that many of the kits you can purchase are a bit too advanced
for kindergartners, there are plenty that are perfect for any age. You
can head over to <a href="http://www.makershed.com/collections/beginner" target="_self">www.makershed.com/collections/beginner</a> to see a
bunch of pre-selected projects designed for beginners of all ages. All
it takes is a dancing brush-bot or a handful of LED throwies to make
kids fall in love with making things.

(Image via <a href="http://www.makershed.com" target="_self">www.makershed.com</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
Even if you don't purchase the kits from Maker Shed, I urge you to inspire
the youngsters in your life into creating awesome things. If you guide
them, they'll be less likely to do the sorts of things I did in my youth,
like make a stun gun from an automobile ignition coil and take it to
school to show my friends. Trust me, principals are far more impressed
with an Altoid-tin phone charger for show and tell than with a duct-tape-mounted taser gun.
</p><p>
You can buy pre-made kits at <a href="http://www.makershed.com" target="_self">www.makershed.com</a> or visit sites like
<a href="http://instructables.com" target="_self">instructables.com</a> for homemade ideas you can make yourself. In fact,
doing cool projects with kids is such an awesome thing to do, it gets this
month's Editors' Choice award. Giving an idea the award might seem like
an odd thing to do, but who doesn't love science projects? We sure do!

<h2 class="title">Simple Photo Editing, Linux Edition!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #259, November 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
A while back I wrote about the awesome open-source image editing program
Paint.NET, which is available only for Windows. Although I'm thrilled there
is an open-source option for Windows users, Paint.NET is one of those
apps that is so cool, I wish it worked in Linux! Thankfully, there's
another app in town with similar features, and it's cross-platform!
</p><p>
Pinta isn't exactly a Paint.NET clone, but it looks and functions very
much like the Windows-only image editor. It has simple controls, but
they're powerful enough to do most of the simple image editing you need
to do on a day-to-day basis. Whether you want to apply artistic filters,
autocorrect color levels or just crop a former friend out of a group
photo, Pinta has you covered.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11937pintaf1.large.jpg"><img src="11937pintaf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
(Image from <a href="http://www.pinta-project.com" target="_self">www.pinta-project.com</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
There certainly are more robust image editing options available for Linux,
but often programs like GIMP are overkill for simple editing. Pinta is
designed with the &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; mentality. It's available for Linux,
OS X, Windows and even BSD, so there's no reason to avoid trying Pinta
today. Check it out at <a href="http://www.pinta-project.com" target="_self">www.pinta-project.com</a>.

<h2 class="title">Recipy for Science</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #259, November 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
More and more journals are demanding that
the science being published be reproducible. Ideally, if you publish your
code, that should be enough for someone else to reproduce the results
you are claiming. But, anyone who has done any actual computational
science knows that this is not true. The number of times you twiddle
bits of your code to test different hypotheses, or the specific bits of
data you use to test your code and then to do your actual analysis, grows
exponentially as you are going through your research program. It becomes
very difficult to keep track of all of those changes and variations over
time. 
</p><p>
Because more and more scientific work is being done in Python, a
new tool is available to help automate the recording of your research
program. Recipy is a new Python module that you can use within your code
development to manage the history of said code development.
</p><p>
Recipy exists in the Python module repository, so installation can be
as easy as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pip install recipy
</pre>
</p><p>
The code resides in a GitHub repository, so you always can get the
latest and greatest version by cloning the repository and installing
it manually. If you do decide to install manually, you also can install
the requirements with the following using the file from the recipy
source code::

<pre     class="programlisting">
pip install -r requirements.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have it installed,
using it is extremely easy. You can alter your scripts by adding this line
to the top of the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import recipy
</pre>
</p><p>
It needs to be the very first line of Python
executed in order to capture everything else that happens within your
program. If you don't even want to alter your files that much, you can
run your code through Recipy with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python -m recipy my_script.py
</pre>
</p><p>
All of the reporting data is stored within a TinyDB database, in a
file named test.npy.
</p><p>
Once you have collected the details of your code, you now can start to
play around with the results stored in the test.npy file. To explore this
module, let's use the sample code from the recipy documentation. A
short example is the following, saved in the file my_script.py:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import recipy
import numpy
arr = numpy.arange(10)
arr = arr + 500
numpy.save('test.npy', arr)
</pre>
</p><p>
The recipy module includes a script
called recipy that can process the stored data. As a first look, you
can use the following command, which will pull up details about the run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
recipy search test.npy
</pre>
</p><p>
On my Cygwin machine (the power tool
for Linux users forced to use a Windows machine), the results look like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Run ID: eb4de53f-d90c-4451-8e35-d765cb82d4f9
Created by berna_000 on 2015-09-07T02:18:17
Ran /cygdrive/c/Users/berna_000/Dropbox/writing/lj/
&#8618;science/recipy/my_script.py using /usr/bin/python
Git: commit 1149a58066ee6d2b6baa88ba00fd9effcf434689, in 
 &#8618;repo /cygdrive/c/Users/berna_000/Dropbox/writing, 
 &#8618;with origin https://github.com/joeybernard/writing.git
Environment: CYGWIN_NT-10.0-2.2.0-0.289-5-3-x86_64-64bit, 
 &#8618;python 2.7.10 (default, Jun  1 2015, 18:05:38)
Inputs: none

Outputs: /cygdrive/c/Users/berna_000/Dropbox/writing/lj/
&#8618;science/recipy/test.npy
</pre>
</p><p>
Every time you run your program, a new entry is added to the 
test.npy file. When you run the search command again, you will get a
message like the following to let you know:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
** Previous runs creating this output have been found. 
 &#8618;Run with --all to show. **
</pre>
</p><p>
If using a text interface isn't your cup of tea,
there is a GUI available with the following command, which gives you a potentially
nicer interface (Figure 1):

<pre     class="programlisting">
recipy gui
</pre>
</p><p>
This GUI is
actually Web-based, so once you are done running this command, you can
open it in the browser of your choice.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11937recipyf1.large.jpg"><img src="11937recipyf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Recipy includes a GUI that provides a more intuitive way to
work with your run data.
</p></div></div><p>
Recipy stores its configuration and the database files within the
directory ~/.recipy. The configuration is stored in the recipyrc file
in this folder. The database files also
are located here by default. But, you can change that by using the
configuration option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[database] path = /path/to/file.json
</pre>
</p><p>
This way, you can store these database files in a place where they will
be backed up and potentially versioned. 
</p><p>
You can change the amount of
information being logged with a few different configuration options. In
the <tt  >[general]</tt> section, you can use the
<tt  >debug</tt> option to include
debugging messages or <tt  >quiet</tt> to not print any messages. 
</p><p>
By default,
all of the metadata around git commands is included within the recorded
information. You can ignore some of this metadata selectively with
the configuration section <tt  >[ignored metadata]</tt>. If you
use the <tt  >diff</tt>
option, the output from a <tt  >git diff</tt> command won't be stored. If instead
you wanted to ignore everything, you could use the 
<tt  >git</tt> option to skip
everything related to git commands. You can ignore specific modules on
either the recorded inputs or the outputs by using the configuration
sections <tt  >[ignored inputs]</tt> and <tt  >[ignored
outputs]</tt>, respectively. For
example, if you want to skip recording any outputs from the numpy
module, you could use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[ignored outputs]
numpy
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to skip everything, you could use the special 
<tt  >all</tt>
option for either section. If these options are stored in the main configuration
file mentioned above, it will apply to all of your recipy runs. If you
want to use different options for different projects, you can use a
file named .recipyrc within the current directory with the specific
options for the project.
</p><p>
The way that recipy works is that it ties into the Python system for
importing modules. It does this by using wrapping classes around the
modules that you want to record. Currently, the supported modules are
numpy, scikit-learn, pandas, scikit-image, matplotlib, pillow,
GDAL and nibabel.
</p><p>
The wrapper function is extremely simple, however, so it is an easy
matter to add wrappers for your favorite scientific module. All you
need to do is implement the PatchSimple interface and add lists of the
input and output functions that you want logged.
</p><p>
After reading this article, you never should lose track of how you reached
your results. You can configure recipy to record the details you
find most important and be able to redo any calculation you did in the
past. Techniques for reproducible research are going to be more important
in the future, so this is definitely one method to add to your
toolbox. Seeing as it is only at version 0.1.0, it will be well worth
following this project to see how it matures and what new functionality
is added to it in the future.
