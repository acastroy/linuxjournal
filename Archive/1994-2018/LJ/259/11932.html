EXIN Specialist Certificate in OpenStack Software Neutron</h2></div></div><p>
Building on its successful foundational certificate in OpenStack software,
the independent certification institute EXIN recently released its first
specialist exam in the series, dubbed EXIN Specialist Certificate in
OpenStack Software Neutron. Neutron is a cloud-networking controller within
the OpenStack cloud computing initiative that delivers networking as a
service. This new advanced exam is aimed at experienced users of OpenStack
technology who design or build infrastructure. The vendor-neutral content,
which was developed in close cooperation with Hewlett-Packard, covers
architecture, plug-ins and extensions, managing networks, and
troubleshooting methodology and tools. EXIN's mission with the new exam
on Neutron is to enable experienced professionals to advance their careers
by demonstrating their specialist skills and knowledge related to OpenStack
software. In 2016, EXIN expects to launch certifications for OpenStack
Software Swift and Cinder.

TeamQuest's Performance Software</h2></div></div><p>
Carrying the simple moniker Performance Software, the latest innovation in
predictive analytics from TeamQuest is a powerful application that enables
organizations to assess intuitively the health and potential risks in their
IT infrastructure. The secret to Performance Software's ability to warn
IT management of problems before they occur stems from the deployment of
lightning-fast and accurate predictive algorithms, coupled with the most
popular IT data sources, including Amazon, Tivoli and HP. Customers 
also can perform data collection, analysis, predictive analytics and capacity
planning for Ubuntu. TeamQuest calls itself the first organization that
allows the existing infrastructure to remain entirely intact and augments
the existing environment's operations with the industry-leading
accurate risk assessment software. The firm also asserts that while
competitors base their predictive and proactive capabilities on simplistic
approximations of how IT infrastructure scales, only TeamQuest utilizes
advanced queuing theory to predict what really matters&mdash;throughput and
response time&mdash;not just resource utilization.

Linaro Ltd.'s Secure Media Solutions for ARM-Based SoCs</h2></div></div><p>
The embedded developer community is the target audience for Linaro
Ltd.'s new open-source secure media solution for consumption of premium
content on ARM-powered devices. In this solution, with support from
Microsoft and the OpenCDM project, Linaro has successfully integrated
several security features required by premium content service providers
with the Microsoft PlayReady Digital Rights Management (DRM). Linaro's
new solution enables application developers, silicon partners, OEMs,
operators and content owners to use open-source technology to build
feature-rich, secure products for the pay TV market. By bringing together
all of the essential secure hardware and software elements into an
open-source design, OEMs can reduce their time to market and provide new
opportunities for service providers to deliver premium content across more
consumer devices built on ARM-based SoCs. Essential security features
include the World Wide Web Consortium's Encrypted Media Extensions,
which enable premium-content service providers to write their electronic
programming guide applications using standard HTML5 one time and run it on
myriad devices. Linaro asserts that its new solution is &ldquo;a key
milestone that showcases how Microsoft PlayReady DRM works cross-platform
in a standard way&rdquo;.

iWedia's Teatro-3.0</h2></div></div><p>
By integrating AllConnect streaming technology from Tuxera, iWedia's
Teatro-3.0 set-top box (STB) software solution lets users take full control
of the connected home and share music, photos, videos, movies and TV
content to any screen. Teatro-3.0 is Linux-based with a UI built with
HTML/CSS and specific JavaScript APIs allowing access to digital TV
features. The solution features DLNA (player and renderer), access to
&ldquo;walled garden&rdquo; Web and OTT video services (CE-HTML portals, HbbTV
applications), as well as DVR and Time Shift Buffer. The streaming
functionality occurs when Tuxera's AllConnect App discovers and dialogs
with the DLNA Digital Media Renderer embedded in Teatro-3.0. The app then
streams any content chosen by the user to the Teatro-3.0 media player.
iWedia states that its STB easily can integrate into any hardware or
software and is &ldquo;the only solution to the market compatible with all
smart TVs and STBs&rdquo;, including Apple TV, Android TV, Fire TV and Roku.

Mike Barlow's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning to Love Data Science</em></span> (O'Reilly Media)</h2></div></div><p>
The title of Mike Barlow's new O'Reilly book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning to Love Data
Science</em></span>, implies an inherent drudgery in the material. Bah! Most Linux
enthusiasts will find magnetic the material in Barlow's tome, which is
subtitled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Explorations of Emerging Technologies and Platforms for
Predictive Analytics, Machine Learning, Digital Manufacturing and Supply
Chain Optimization</em></span>. Covering data for social good to data for predictive
maintenance, the book's format is an anthology of reports that offer a
broad overview of the data space, including the applications that have
arisen in enterprise companies, non-profits and everywhere in between.
Barlow discusses&mdash;for both developers and suits&mdash;the culture that creates
a data-driven organization and dives deeply into some of the business,
social and technological advances brought about by our ability to handle
and process massive amounts of data at scale. Readers also will understand
how to promote and use data science in an organization, gain insights into
the role of the CIO and explore the tension between securing data and
encouraging rapid innovation, among other topics.

Scott Stawski's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Inflection Point</em></span> (Pearson FT Press)</h2></div></div><p>
If you can't beat megatrends, join 'em. Such is the advice from
Scott Stawski, author of the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Inflection Point: How the Convergence
of Cloud, Mobility, Apps, and Data Will Shape the Future of
Business</em></span>. As
the executive lead for HP's largest and most strategic global accounts,
Stawski enjoys an enviable perch from which to appraise the most influential
trends in IT. Today a hurricane is forming, says Stawski, and businesses
are headed straight into it. As the full title implies, the enormous
disrupters in IT&mdash;in cloud, mobility, apps and data&mdash;are going
to
disrupt, and those who can harness the fierce winds of change will have
them at their back and cruise toward greater competitiveness and customer
value. Stawski illuminates how to go beyond inadequate incremental
improvements to reduce IT spending dramatically and virtually eliminate IT
capital expenditures. One meaningful step at a time, readers learn how to
transform Operational IT into both a utility and a true business enabler,
bringing new speed, flexibility and focus to what really matters: true
core competencies.

Introversion Software's Prison Architect</h2></div></div><p>
In one of its Alpha videos, the lead developer of the game <span   class="emphasis"><em>Prison
Architect</em></span>
quipped: &ldquo;since this is Introversion Software that we're talking
about, we're likely to be in Alpha for quite some time.&rdquo; That's
no exaggeration. Since 2012, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> received 36 monthly Alpha
updates to the multi-platform game. In its 36th Alpha video, Introversion
Software at last officially announced the full release of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Prison
Architect</em></span>,
a sim game in which users build and manage a maximum-security penitentiary
facility. In the game, mere mortals must confront real-world challenges,
such as guards under attack, prison breaks, fires in the mess hall,
chaplain management and much more. Introversion takes pride in its
independence from other game developers and promises a better game
experience as a result. In addition to downloading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Prison
Architect</em></span> for
Linux, Windows or Mac OS, one also can become immortalized in the game as a
prisoner. Sadly, the options to digital-immorto-criminalize your face or
design one of the wardens are both sold out.

Sensoray's Model 2224 HD/SD-SDI Audio/Video Encoder </h2></div></div><p>
Video capturing and processing is what Sensoray's new Model 2224
HD/SD-SDI Audio/Video H.264 Encoder was built to do. The encoder's
single SDI input supports a wide range of video resolutions&mdash;that is, 1080p,
1080i, 720p and NTSC/PAL. The Model 2224, featuring a USB 2.0 connection to
its host CPU, offers excellent quality encoding in a convenient small form
factor, says Sensoray. The Model 2224 encoder outputs H.264 High Profile
Level 4 for HD and Main Profile Level 3 for SD, multiplexed in MPEG-TS
(transport stream) format. The board's versatile overlay generators,
integral HD/SD raw frame grabber and live preview stream make it ideally
suited for a wide range of video processing applications, including High
Profile DVRs, NVRs and stream servers. Furthermore, the encoder is
Blu-Ray-compatible and allows for full-screen 16-bit color text/graphics overlay
with transparency. The board can send an uncompressed, down-scaled video
stream over USB, offering users low-latency live video previewing on the
host computer with minimal CPU usage.
