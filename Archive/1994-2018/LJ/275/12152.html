Back in the early '00s, John Perry Barlow
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow</a>) said
&ldquo;I didn't start hearing about
'content' until the container business felt threatened.&rdquo; <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> was
one of those containers&mdash;so was every other magazine, newspaper and
broadcast station. Today, those containers are bobbing around in an ocean of
&ldquo;content&rdquo; on the internet. Worse, the stuff inside the containers, which we
used to call &ldquo;editorial&rdquo;, is now a breed of
&ldquo;content&rdquo; too.
</p><p>
In the old days, editorial lived on one side of a &ldquo;Chinese
wall&rdquo; between
itself and the publishing side of a newspaper or magazine. The same went for the
programming and advertising sides of a commercial broadcast station or
network. The wall was transparent, meaning it was possible for a writer, a
photographer, a newscaster or a performing artist to see what funded the
operation, but the ethical thing was to ignore what happened on the other
side of that wall. Which was easy to do, because everything on the other
side of that wall was somebody else's job.
</p><p>
Today that wall has been destroyed by the imperatives of &ldquo;content
production&rdquo;, which is the new job of journalists and everybody else devoted
to &ldquo;generating content&rdquo; in maximum volumes, all the better to attract
&ldquo;programmatic&rdquo; advertising.
</p><p>
You can see the wreckage of one such wall in a January 2017 <span   class="emphasis"><em>The New
York Times</em></span> story titled &ldquo;In New Jersey, Only a Few Media
Watchdogs Are Left&rdquo;
(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/nyregion/in-new-jersey-only-a-few-media-watchdogs-are-left.html?_r=2" target="_self">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/nyregion/in-new-jersey-only-a-few-media-watchdogs-are-left.html?_r=2</a>), by David
Chen. In it he writes, &ldquo;The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star-Ledger</em></span>, which almost halved its newsroom
eight years ago, has mutated into a digital media company requiring most
reporters to reach an ever-increasing quota of page views as part of their
compensation.&rdquo;
</p><p>
As I explained in my January 2016 article &ldquo;What We Can Do with Ad Blocking's
Leverage&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/what-we-can-do-ad-blockings-leverage" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/what-we-can-do-ad-blockings-leverage</a>), the advertising we're talking about here isn't the old Madison
Avenue kind that lived on the other side of journalism's Chinese wall. It's
a new all-digital kind called <span   class="emphasis"><em>adtech</em></span>. While adtech is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>called</em></span> advertising,
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>looks</em></span> like advertising, it is actually a breed of
direct marketing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_marketing" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_marketing</a>), a
cousin of spam descended from junk mail.
</p><p>
Like junk mail, adtech is data-driven, wants to get personal, finds success
in tiny-percentage responses and excuses massive negative
externalities.
Those include wanton and unwelcome surveillance, annoying the crap out of
people and filling the world with crap&mdash;including fake news and
fraudulent advertising.
</p><p>
Here's one way to tell the difference between real advertising and adtech,
using the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star-Ledger</em></span> as an example:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Real advertising wants to be in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star-Ledger</em></span> because it values the
paper's journalism and readership.
</p></li><li><p>
Adtech wants to push ads at readers anywhere it can find them, based on
gathered intelligence, algorithms and whatever else shows up in live auction
markets for eyeballs.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In the old advertising-supported publishing world,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>journalism</em></span> was what
mattered most. In the new adtech-supported publishing world,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>content</em></span> is what
matters most.
</p><p>
Real advertisers in the old publishing world were flattered to be in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Star-Ledger</em></span>. Adtech-oriented advertisers in the new publishing world just
want to &ldquo;go digital&rdquo;, whatever it takes. And there are thousands of
intermediaries
(<a href="http://cdn.chiefmartec.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/marketing_technology_landscape_2016.jpg" target="_self">cdn.chiefmartec.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/marketing_technology_landscape_2016.jpg</a>) to help with that.
</p><p>
As I wrote in &ldquo;Separating advertising's wheat and chaff&rdquo;
(<a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff-47858adfcb20#.pgujy36im" target="_self">https://medium.com/@dsearls/separating-advertisings-wheat-and-chaff-47858adfcb20#.pgujy36im</a>), it is because of
that orientation, and those intermediaries, that &ldquo;Madison Avenue fell
asleep, direct response marketing ate its brain, and it woke up as an alien
replica of itself.&rdquo;
</p><p>
That's also why, to operate in publishing's new body-snatched economy,
journalists are incentivized to meet that &ldquo;ever-increasing quota of page
views&rdquo;. When the incentives are volume-based. what happens to
quality?
</p><p>
It is essential to note that adtech, by design, doesn't care about
journalism at all. That's because adtech values a maximized sum of content
in the world, regardless of how good that content is or where it comes
from. The more content, the more places ads can be run.
</p><p>
It is also ridiculously easy to make adtech money with content, especially
since there is nothing about content as a substance that requires facts to
back it up. This is why, according to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Buzzfeed</em></span>
(<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo?utm_term=.gcAwkw26PA#.gs5dxdRJEz" target="_self">https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo?utm_term=.gcAwkw26PA#.gs5dxdRJEz</a>), teenagers in one town in
Macedonia made as much as $3,000 a day by generating fake news (such as
&ldquo;Pope
endorses Trump&rdquo;) during the 2016 US presidential election.
</p><p>
In my January 2017 EOF &ldquo;Debugging Democracy&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/debugging-democracy" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/debugging-democracy</a>), I made the mistake of opening
with negative remarks about the winner of that election, which distracted
readers from my main point, which was that journalism is corrupted,
marginalized and suffering in a world where a business based on surveillance
stokes people's prejudices and drives them into mutually hostile echo
chambers (<a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed" target="_self">graphics.wsj.com/blue-feed-red-feed</a>), damaging every democracy that depends on having at least some
common ground on which agreement, or at least compromise, can be found. And
I thought the topic was a good one for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> because readers such as
ours are in a good position to help fix it.
</p><p>
I also think publishing needs to re-brain Madison Avenue and its employers
who are drunk on digital
(<a href="https://medium.com/@dsearls/tv-viewers-to-madison-avenue-please-quit-driving-drunk-on-adtech-6657728ab597#.klgyhav24" target="_self">https://medium.com/@dsearls/tv-viewers-to-madison-avenue-please-quit-driving-drunk-on-adtech-6657728ab597#.klgyhav24</a>) and demand real advertising by real advertisers
who want to sponsor real journalism.
</p><p>
To support that effort, I will now cross our own Chinese wall here at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> and thank the advertisers listed each month below my column. Those
advertisers are brands in the best sense of the word. I hope we attract more
like them to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> with this simple fact: even though countless
$billions (or perhaps $trillions by now) have been spent on adtech, not one
brand has been built by it.
