TRENDnet's WiFi Everywhere Powerline 1200 AV2 Access Point, Model
TPL-430AP</h2></div></div><p>
TRENDnet recently released an innovative new solution that creates
dead-spot-free home Wi-Fi by leveraging a home's existing electrical
system. TRENDnet's WiFi Everywhere Powerline 1200 AV2 Access Point
adapter, model TPL-430AP, uses existing electrical lines to create a wired
home network and doubles as an access point to deliver a wireless signal
from nearly any power outlet. The adapter supports Powerline 1200 networking
with a built-in dual-band wireless AC1200 access point and features MIMO
with Beamforming technology to enhance performance and range. WiFi Clone
support duplicates one's existing wireless network settings, reducing
Wi-Fi setup time from minutes to just seconds. Powerline range functions up
to 984 feet (300m) over existing electrical lines.

NETGEAR, Inc.'s GSS108EPP and GS408EPP Switches</h2></div></div><p>
Two new NETGEAR, Inc., Power-Over-Ethernet (PoE) switches feature a novel
&ldquo;Virtually Anywhere&rdquo; mounting system that delivers modern high-power
PoE+ to devices that others cannot. The mounting system on the two
models&mdash;the ProSAFE 8-port Gigabit Ethernet Web Managed PoE+ Click Switch
(GSS108EPP) and the ProSAFE Easy-Mount 8-port Gigabit Ethernet PoE+ Web
Managed Switch (GS408EPP)&mdash;offers ultimate flexibility in placement so
that PoE+
ports are available exactly where needed to power WAPs, VoIP phones, IP
surveillance cameras and IoT devices. In any orientation, they can be mounted
on a wall, strapped to a pole or tucked under a desk or tabletop. In
addition, the GS408EPP's unique design allows for two switches to be
mounted in a single 1U rack slot, saving valuable rack space while allowing
for future expansion. Both switches also provide configurable, advanced
Layer 2 network features.

SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension</h2></div></div><p>
Historically, data replication has been available only piecemeal through
proprietary vendors. In a quest to remediate history, SUSE and partner
LINBIT announced a solution that promises to change the economics of data
replication. The two companies' collaborative effort is the headliner in
the updated SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension, which now
includes LINBIT's integrated geo-clustering technology. Providing a new
capability to replicate data across unlimited distances, LINBIT has enhanced
SUSE's high availability solution that is built on open-source software
and runs on commodity hardware. The LINBIT solution guards against failures
or disasters by providing policy-driven mechanisms for customer
applications, and data, to continue operations in another geographically
dispersed data center. SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension is
an integrated suite of open-source clustering technologies&mdash;from LINBIT and
others&mdash;that enables customers to eliminate single points of failure, thus
helping to maintain business continuity, enable compliance, protect data
integrity, maintain isolation for multiple tenants and reduce unplanned
downtime for mission-critical workloads.
