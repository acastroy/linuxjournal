Like most fancy tech terms, &ldquo;Cloud Computing&rdquo; has lost its newness, and
it's now
just a commodity we purchase. It's often so much easier to provision virtual machines
than it is to buy and host your own servers. Yes, there are concerns over privacy and
security when your data is in the cloud. When you host in your own data center,
however, there's still the possibility of a rogue cleaning crew getting to your
servers. (We've all seen the movies; it just takes a mop and a blue jumper to get you
into the most secure data center.) Regardless of your stance on cloud computing, it's
here to stay. This month, we talk a bit about how to live in this bold new world.

Reuven M. Lerner starts things off with more information about machine learning. What if
the software itself could suss out the important patterns and information from your
data instead of feeding it presorted information for simple data mining? Reuven
describes
&ldquo;unsupervised machine learning&rdquo; this month, and it's either awesome or terrifying,
depending on how you feel about such things. 
</p><p>
Dave Taylor follows with a look at one of
my favorite command-line application suites: ImageMagick. I use a few of the tools
with my ongoing birdcam project. Dave explores all sorts of ways to manipulate images
from the command line, and his article is only the tip of the iceberg!
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin delves into automation for sysadmins this month.
Thanks to DevOps and the like,
task automation is far more robust than it used to be. Kyle explains why we
should automate, when we should automate and how we should go about doing it. Although
it's
tempting to replace your system administrator with a few DevOps tools, that human
factor is invaluable.

I take a look at entertainment this month, specifically as it
pertains to watching television. Many of you are &ldquo;cord cutters&rdquo;, but for the few still
holding on to their cable subscription (such as myself), it's important to understand the
various options out there. Thankfully, we're closer to a complete television
experience over the internet than ever before. This month, I look at some of the
available options.

Rune Torbensen and S&oslash;ren Top describe
building a Linux cluster in the cloud for the purpose of data analysis with R.
Building a huge cluster of machines in your
own data center is impractical for most people, especially when that cluster isn't
needed as a permanent fixture. Rune and S&oslash;ren show how to take advantage of the
cloud along with open-source tools like Hadoop and R to analyze logs. 
</p><p>
Andy Carlson
follows them with an article on writing custom Apache configurations in order to run
specific applications on the web. Yes, it's the sort of thing you can do on your own
hardware, but again, the cloud is a convenient way to treat computing like a
commodity, so having methods that are flexible are vital in our modern IT world.
</p><p>
Love it or hate it, the cloud isn't going away any time soon. As someone who 
historically has had server racks full of last-generation servers in his basement (that's
all I could afford), I can't express how happy the cloud makes me. Before you can
safely take advantage of using someone else's servers for your data, it's important to
understand not only how the cloud itself works, but also how your software integrates. And
understanding open-source software is what we love most here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
