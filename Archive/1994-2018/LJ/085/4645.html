of the Hollywood 10 and the Blacklist lives on. I knew many of the
blacklisted writers from my Sundance days and the experiences they
had with HUAC left them bitter and sometimes broken. These were
incredibly talented people whose lives were ruined by &ldquo;The Big
Lie&rdquo;.
</p><p>While it's easy to poke fun at remarks from Microsoft's Jim
Allchin&mdash;and yes, there was a lot to laugh at&mdash;it also raises a
flag. It's easy to dismiss his seemingly ridiculous charge that
free software is un-American, but I'm not sure we should just laugh
it off. There's always a chance that some uneducated loose cannon
will take Allchin's remarks at face value, especially if the loose
cannon happens to hold a public office somewhere.</p><p>GNU/Linux companies and people who are passionate about Linux
need to make their voices heard on Capitol Hill and in local and
state legislatures. Linux International
(<a href="http://www.li.org" target="_self">http://www.li.org/</a>) has
changed its bylaws recently to include the ability to form special
interest groups and lobby. SIIA
(<a href="http://www.siia.net" target="_self">http://www.siia.net/</a>),
the oldest and largest trade association of the software industry,
hosted an Open Source Division meeting at their annual meeting (see
full item below) with the idea of forming an agenda to address with
legislators.</p><p>While flaming easy targets like Allchin is personally
gratifying, we also have to be very vigilant&mdash;utilizing the
existing frameworks of .orgs like Linux International and SIIA
warrants a closer look.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26ed580.0x27e57c0"></a>Profile&mdash;The Linux Professional
Institute</h2></div></div><p>The Linux Professional Institute
(<a href="http://www.lpi.org" target="_self">www.lpi.org</a>)
designs and delivers a standardized, multinational program to
certify levels of individual expertise in Linux. The programs are
put through a rigorous benchmarking process so that they will
satisfy the requirements of Linux professionals and the
organizations that would employ or contract them. They currently
have Level 1 certification available for basic level system
administrators and are working on Levels 2 and 3. LPI maintains
vendor neutrality, and the testing is deployed globally, in
English, through Virtual University Enterprise
(<a href="http://www.vue.com" target="_self">http://www.vue.com/</a>).</p><p>&ldquo;The Linux Professional Institute preserves freedom of
choice in how people prepare for their certification exams,&rdquo; Dan
York, president of LPI said. On their web site they offer a list of
books, training centers and courses that can help someone prepare.
LPI developed the exams using peer industry standard practices and
psychometrics. In other words, they polled more than 1,400 people
for the Level 1 test, asking them to complete a job-task analysis
survey. The survey assesses tasks and knowledge sets that a person
at each level of proficiency should know how to do. The goal,
according to York, is to develop objectives that can be validated
on a real-world basis. Legal defensibility of the tests is also an
important component.</p><p>LPI is currently developing the Level 2 test and has polled
more than 200 professionals thus far. The task is time consuming
and lengthy, but creating a solid testing metric is worth the time
and effort, according to York.</p><p>LPI could use the help of Linux professionals in the exam
process. They need people who can review, write and translate Level
2 questions, as well as do ongoing maintenance and review of the
Level 1 test to help keep it current. They could also use a hand in
fund-raising and marketing. Because they have no budget for
marketing, participants in the certification process learn about
LPI through word-of-mouth. Companies could consider giving
employees a few hours a week to work on LPI initiatives. For

Diego</h2></div></div><p>The Software Information Industry Association (SIIA) held the
inaugural meeting of the Open Source Division, a new special
interest group at their annual conference in San Diego. The agenda
included discussions on the future of the open-source computing
model and strategies to increase market acceptance of free
software. They also discussed public policy developments affecting
open-source companies and created a strategy for future action. Red
Hat was the first free software company to join SIIA.</p><p>The SIIA is an international trade organization for software
companies. During the antitrust case of recent history, SIIA filed
a brief in the case siding with the government. This was done
despite a Microsoft executive sitting on SIIA's board of directors.
Within days of the filing, Microsoft resigned its membership.
According to Ken Walsh, president of SIIA, it was more important to
do the right thing and go with the majority of the board's opinion,
than to bow to one member.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26ed580.0x27e5c38"></a>GNOME Foundation</h2></div></div><p>The GNOME Foundation
(<a href="http://www.gnome.org" target="_self">http://www.gnome.org/</a>)
released GNOME version 1.4, a mature, stable release of the desktop
environment. The release includes a host of cool bells and
whistles, as well as some additional packages, including Nautilus,
Eazel's file management system. The release represents a big step
forward for GNOME, moving more solidly in the usability and power
category.</p><p>GNOME 1.4 has extensive documentation available through the
Help tab. It is available for download on a number of mirror sites
that can be reached through
<a href="http://www.gnome.org" target="_self">http://www.gnome.org/</a> and
will be available in many distributions. Check the web site to get
information on the most current ways to get GNOME 1.4.</p></div></div>
