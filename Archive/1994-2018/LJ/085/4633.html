    Rick takes a customary &ldquo;walk on the embedded
    side&rdquo; of LinuxWorld Expo in New York City.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b4580.0x29ac608"></a></h2></div></div><p> After three days of roaming some 100,000
square feet of exhibition area populated by 200 companies' exhibits
and attended by perhaps 20,000 &ldquo;Penguinistas&rdquo;, I've certainly had
an eyeful of Linux.
</p><p>After letting it all sink in for a few days, I've come up
with a few general observations. First of all, there were more
suits this year, more glitzy exhibits and fewer of the small (10 x
10 foot) booths. Second, many more exhibitors displayed this
year&mdash;the exhibit area seemed to have doubled in size since last
year's New York show. Also, this year's show suggests Linux has hit
adolescence. There seemed to be much more of an air of a maturing
industry in comparison with last year's New York show, with
companies like IBM, Intel, Compaq, Sun, SGI and HP on hand.
Finally, embedded really arrived at this LWE. A common theme just
about everywhere was the growing importance of Linux in &ldquo;devices&rdquo;
and embedded systems. In fact, I'll venture a prediction that this
year is shaping up to be &ldquo;the year of Linux in devices&rdquo;--with
products like Linux-based PDAs, cell phones, webpads and set-top
entertainment systems hitting the market in growing numbers.</p><p>Of the 200 exhibitors, roughly 20 identified themselves in
the show guide as offering &ldquo;embedded systems&rdquo; products, but
nearly twice that number were promoting embedded Linux products or
services of one kind or another. In case you missed the show,
here's a brief summary of what I found.</p><p>Accelent Systems showed their Integrated Development
Platform, an embedded Linux- and StrongARM-based reference platform
to help companies develop Linux-based internet appliances and other
embedded devices. See
<a href="http://www.accelent.com" target="_self">http://www.accelent.com/</a>.</p><p>Applied Data Systems showed four demos of their GUI-oriented
embedded Linux- and StrongARM-based single-board computers (SBCs),
despite having all of their booth equipment lost in transit. These
included the Bitsy, a 3" x 4" SBC running embedded Linux; the
Tandem, a two-headed StrongARM SBC running two independent displays
off one processor under embedded Linux; the Graphics Client Plus,
running Century Software's Linux desktop toolkit; and the Graphics
Master running embedded Linux. See
<a href="http://www.applieddata.net" target="_self">http://www.applieddata.net/</a>.</p><p>Axiom showed a number of embedded and industrially oriented
single-board computers in the PC/104, EBX, 3.5" and half-size
slot-card form factors. Axiom's products are now supported under
Linux. See
<a href="http://www.axiomtek.com" target="_self">http://www.axiomtek.com/</a>.</p><p>BSDi had a sign at their booth that said &ldquo;eBSD&mdash;the Internet
Expert's Choice to Embed in Internet Applications and Appliances&rdquo;.
There wasn't any further explanation available nor was anyone
around who could tell me anything about the company's strategy with
respect to the embedded (BSD) market. See
<a href="http://www.bsdi.com" target="_self">http://www.bsdi.com/</a>.</p><p>At Century Software's pedestal in Red Hat's pavilion, Century
Software's Microwindows, ViewML and PDA software toolkit were being
demonstrated on three platforms:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The first public demonstration of full motion MPEG
video under Microwindows, based on a fast framebuffer display
technology known as Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), was running on
an ADS Graphics Master SBC.</p></li><li><p>Microwindows, the latest ScreenTop PDA suite,
802.11 wireless networking and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span> (the game)
were all being demonstrated on a Compaq iPAQ. Century Software CEO
Greg Haerr described the latest ScreenTop programs as &ldquo;more
user-friendly and Palm-like&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>In this third demo, an SIS motherboard was shown
booting all the way to the Microwindows desktop in just seven
seconds&mdash;quite an accomplishment. The secret to doing this is a
combination of LinuxBIOS, the Memory Technology Driver (using a
DiskOnChip Flash disk), a small footprint Linux kernel and, of
course, Microwindows. See
<a href="http://embedded.centurysoftware.com" target="_self">http://embedded.centurysoftware.com/</a>.</p></li></ul></div><p>Compaq was naturally showing off the exceedingly popular
StrongARM-based iPAQ PDA, which these days seems to have become the
preferred platform for Linux PDA software development. Just try to
buy one. See
<a href="http://www.compaq.com" target="_self">http://www.compaq.com/</a>.
</p><p>Coventive had its LinuxWorld debut featuring a massive
circular pavilion with a large number of Coventive and partner
product and technology demos distributed all around its
circumference: Axis Corporation's (Japan) canD, a very small,
stylish and easy-to-install Linux-based TV set-top box with a
remote control, containing a customized GUI and Linux software that
fits in 8MB ROM, all based on Coventive's XTinux embedded Linux
operating system; a Chinese Linux PDA manufactured by Legend, based
on an Intel StrongARM processor and Coventive's XTinux, including a
full-featured browser with PIM/SYNC funtions as well as handwriting
recognition for simplified and traditional Chinese; a Linux-based,
on-line stock trading software application demonstrated on
Coventive's set-top box reference design; one of the first
Linux-based smart card readers from Disonic (Taiwan) and a
&ldquo;Gigabyte Server Appliance&rdquo; with easy-to-use GUI and containing
Coventive's Linux OS embedded in ROM, &ldquo;allowing non-techies to set
up and monitor the network environment&rdquo;. See
<a href="http://www.coventive.com" target="_self">http://www.coventive.com/</a>.</p><p>DevelopOnline showcased both its on-line capabilities and its
partners in five demos: the STMicroelectronics STPC system-on-chip
Internet Appliance reference design, a demo of the DevelopOnline
integrated development environment (IDE), shows precisely how
developers can use the service to upload and test software on
selected reference platforms using one of several on-line embedded
Linux software development kits (SDKs); RidgeRun, a DevelopOnline
partner, explained and demonstrated DSPLinux, an embedded Linux OS
specifically tuned to the requirements of TI dual-core processors
that combine ARM and DSP processors on a single chip; Insignia
Solutions' Jeode Embedded Virtual Machine (EVM), a Java-compatible
embedded software environment demonstrated on a ThinkPad running
Red Hat Linux; and a remote demo, accessed via DevelopOnline's web
technology, shown running the Jeode EVM and the PointBase embedded
database running on an iPAQ under Hard Hat Linux. See
<a href="http://www.developonline.com" target="_self">http://www.developonline.com/</a>.</p><p>Hewlett-Packard demonstrated the new Chai Appliance Platform
for Linux, a suite of integrated software components for creating
internet-enabled information appliances. See
<a href="http://www.embedded.hp.com" target="_self">http://www.embedded.hp.com/</a>.</p><p>IBM showed their ever-popular Linux wristwatch, a complete
Linux system in the body of a tiny (56mm x 48mm), geeky looking
watch. IBM was also demonstrating DB2 Everywhere, a database for
embedded systems that fits in less than 150KB memory, which was
announced at the show. In another part of their very expansive
booth, IBM showed a &ldquo;technology demonstration&rdquo; of a Linux-based
retail point-of-sale (POS) system. See
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/linux" target="_self">http://www.ibm.com/linux/</a>.</p><p>Intel showed several demonstrations of embedded Linux,
including the Assabet reference design for the StrongARM SA-1110
(which forms the basis of Compaq's iPAQ design). The Assabet was
running from a battery pack and, according to the Intel
spokesperson, achieves 10-12 hours of operation with the LCD
backlight turned off, or roughly six hours with the backlight on.
Intel's new XScale microarchitecture, the successor to StrongARM,
was also being demonstrated running embedded Linux at the
MontaVista and LynuxWorks booths. See
<a href="http://developer.intel.com" target="_self">http://developer.intel.com/</a>.</p><p>Lightning Instrumentation showed a miniature embedded
Linux-based router device, the MultiCom Ethernet II.
Lightning-Linux, the embedded Linux OS used within the MultiCom
router device, is also being made available independent of the
hardware. Much of Lightning-Linux is apparently available under the
GPL. See
<a href="http://www.lightning.ch" target="_self">http://www.lightning.ch/</a>.</p><p>linAXE Project had a tiny booth displaying something brand
new. linAXE started out as an effort to develop a Linux-based RTOS
to control the popular &ldquo;BattleBots&rdquo; fighting robots. Since then,
the linAXE Project has broadened its scope. See
<a href="http://linaxe.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://linaxe.sourceforge.net/</a>.</p><p>Lineo had, as usual, a pavilion bustling with activity and
providing many interesting demonstrations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The successor to Lineo's uCsimm is the uCdimm. The
new soDIMM form factor (1.7" x 2.7") SBC is based on a DragonBallVZ
microcontroller and, not surprisingly, runs uClinux.</p></li><li><p>Trolltech (a Lineo partner) was present,
demonstrating Qt/Embedded and the Qt Palmtop Environment
(QPE).</p></li><li><p>Rappore (a Lineo partner) was present,
demonstrating an embedded Linux-based Bluetooth stack in a demo
that consisted of a dollhouse with lighting, garage door, etc.,
controlled by a notebook computer with everything interconnected
via Bluetooth wireless communications.</p></li><li><p>The Lineo SecureEdge VPN router platform was
demonstrated.</p></li><li><p>A small PowerPC-based PC/104 form factor
single-board computer from Embedded Planet was used to demonstrate
M-Systems' latest DiskOnChip embedded Linux driver.</p></li><li><p>The new Lineo Academic Student Kit was on display.
This kit, which contains a uCsimm, the uClinux OS, a small
experimenter board and a detailed instruction manual, will be sold
to students for $250. It includes courseware and software CDs.
Thirteen universities are already using the kit as part of their
computer science classes. See http://www.lineo.com/.</p></li></ul></div><p>LynuxWorks demonstrated the open-source BlueCat Linux and the
proprietary LynxOS real-time OS (RTOS) in their pavilion, which now
represents the combined strengths of LynuxWorks and ISDCorp, a
company acquired by LynuxWorks last summer. Demos included an
interesting display of the Linux application binary interface (ABI)
compatibility of a preview version of the next release of the
proprietary LynxOS real-time OS (RTOS). Similar Linux- and
LynxOS-based systems (PCs) ran identical binary images of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>, along with identical images of another
resource-hogging program. Real-time priority was then adjusted on
the LynxOS RTOS system to show off the capabilities of &ldquo;a true
RTOS&rdquo;. The new SpyKer real-time event profiler and trace tool was
demonstrated, as was PhatNoise's Phatbox, an automobile MP3
player-based on embedded BlueCat Linux. A high-availability chess
game, based on BlueCat Linux with host failover, was demonstrated
at Intel's booth, and M-Systems displayed DiskOnChip support for
BlueCat Linux. See
<a href="http://www.lynuxworks.com" target="_self">http://www.lynuxworks.com/</a>.
</p><p>Metro Link demonstrated Micro-X, a windowing solution for
embedded Linux. &ldquo;Micro-X is based on the X Window System protocol,
so you won't have to learn a new interface to develop for embedded
systems&rdquo;, they say. Micro-X was shown running on an Intel
StrongARM SA-1110 platform. Micro-X fits in as little as 575K of
memory and supports x86, PowerPC and ARM/StrongARM, and will soon
support MIPS. See
<a href="http://www.metrolink.com" target="_self">http://www.metrolink.com/</a>.</p><p>Metroworks showed their recently enhanced CodeWarrior IDE
that provides embedded debugger and remote debugging capabilities
on a Motorola PowerPC 8260 reference board and an Embedded Planet
PC/104 form-factor PowerPC 823 SBC. The booth's theme was
&ldquo;Embedded Linux&mdash;Increasing the IQ of Smart Devices&rdquo;. See
<a href="http://www.metroworks.com" target="_self">http://www.metroworks.com/</a>.</p><p>MontaVista had lots to see, with eight product demos and five
partner demos. Some highlights follow:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A high-availability CompactPCI system demo-based on
Hard Hat Linux, Ziatech and Motorola CompactPCI processors, with
MontaVista's High Availability software, backplane networking
software and hot-swap drivers.</p></li><li><p>Various cross-development tools, graphic embedded
kernel configuration tools, graphical IDEs, remote debuggers and
performance analysis tools.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>@win</b></span>, a small

GTK/GTK+ and QT toolkits).</p></li><li><p>A Compaq iPAQ PDA running Hard Hat Linux and the X
Window System with internet browsing via Netscape 6 and live video
display within an X window.</p></li><li><p>MontaVista's approach to a hard real-time Linux
kernel using two identical systems running sound applications. One
had a &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; Linux kernel, while the other contained
MontaVista's real-time enhancements. The CPU and scheduling latency
for each was shown on a continuously refreshed chart.</p></li><li><p>Motorola's 74xx Altivec processor running Hard Hat
Linux on a Motorola Sandpoint embedded reference design, support
for embedded Java applications under Hard Hat Linux based on IBM's
VisualAge Micro Edition (VAME) and IBM's 750CX/CXe PowerPC running
Hard Hat Linux.</p></li><li><p>A StrongARM-based customer retail point-of-sale
subsystem (designed by RadiSYS for USA Technologies) called ePort
was shown as an exposed electro-mechanical subsystem and mounted
inside a soft drink machine, so now you can browse the Web while
you buy your Coke.</p></li><li><p>A customer's 1U &ldquo;industrial strength&rdquo; rackmount
gateway appliance (made by Diversified Technologies) with Hard Hat
inside.</p></li><li><p>One of the first working demonstrations of embedded
Linux (Hard Hat Linux, of course) running on Intel's new XScale
microarchitecture (the next generation of the StrongARM processor)
running on Intel's XScale evaluation platform. See
<a href="http://www.mvista.com" target="_self">http://www.mvista.com/</a>.</p></li></ul></div><p>Neoware's award-winning Eon computing appliance (the Anything
Box), running the Neolinux 2.0 embedded Linux operating system, was
demonstrated. Unique internet appliance-oriented features such as
ezConnect (a simple user interface) and ezSnap (a software
distribution capability) were demonstrated. See
<a href="http://www.neoware.com" target="_self">http://www.neoware.com/</a>.
</p><p>NexCom showed a number of embedded and industrially oriented
single-board computers in a variety of popular form factors, large
and small. NexCom's products are now supported under Linux. See
<a href="http://www.nexcom.com" target="_self">http://www.nexcom.com/</a>.</p><p>OnCore Systems demonstrated OnCore Linux for Real-Time, a
real-time platform that can host multiple copies of Linux in a hard
real-time system environment. See
<a href="http://www.oncoresystems.com" target="_self">http://www.oncoresystems.com/</a>
for details.</p><p>PEP Modular Computers showed their 3U and 6U CompactPCI
boards and systems now supported under Linux. These kinds of
products are used in high-reliability systems for telecom and
internet infrastructure, industrial control, military and medical
applications. See
<a href="http://www.pep.com" target="_self">http://www.pep.com/</a>.</p><p>Portwell showed a number of embedded and industrially
