    The nonprofit Geekcorps teaches businesses in emerging countries to
    use technology while providing service volunteers opportunities
    to share their skills in unfamiliar circumstances.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12d7580.0x13cf710"></a></h2></div></div><p>As we approach Geekcorps' one year
anniversary of incorporation, it seems impossible that two waves of
Geekcorps volunteers have already been sent to Ghana. Conceived as
a Peace Corps for techies, this nonprofit organization has flung
itself head over heels into the mire of conquering the
international digital divide. Volunteers from the high-tech
industry in the US and Europe spend four months helping businesses
in developing countries&mdash;Ghana at the moment&mdash;to utilize ICT
(information/communication technology) to improve their core
operations.
</p><p>So who wants to do this, and what kind of person does
Geekcorps look for? When I interviewed Peter Beardsley last October
for a volunteer position in Ghana, I thought &ldquo;this guy would be
great.&rdquo; Peter grew up in Connecticut and went to college in New
Hampshire where he studied programming. After discovering Linux
through a friend, he worked on web scripting and applications for
his college as an independent study project. Aside from his
technical skills, what made Peter a great potential volunteer was
his demonstrated interest in helping people out (fixing up old
machines and turning them into servers and NATs for churches and
community groups through his local Linux users' group) and his
belief that technology can truly bring about social and economic
change. Peter has both a love of technology and a willingness to
make it accessible to everyone.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4595f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>How does one train a guy like Peter to go in to an unfamiliar
country and culture and transfer his skills (database development)
to people whose knowledge of IT is often spotty? From the inception
of Geekcorps, training has been an important component of the
program. We had seen many projects where people were sent out
unprepared and uninformed. Unlike the Peace Corps, our volunteers
are only at their assignments for a relatively brief time. We do
not have the luxury of providing weeks of cultural immersion and
seminars on the politics and history of their host country. But
because their stay is so short, we can't have them spend the bulk
of their time in a state of disorientation. Our first two training
programs have taken place at our offices in the US and have lasted
about a week and a half. An additional in-country orientation
focuses more on the practicalities of living and working and lasts
about five days.</p><p>The Geekcorps training program is still (and will probably
always be) a work in progress. We start from the premise that
volunteers do not need subject-matter training (i.e., we don't go
over programming or web design topics). What they do need is a
hefty dose of cross-cultural training, discussions centering on
technology and development, and training of teaching exercises and
expectation management.</p><p>We have discovered that this last item is key. The training
of our second wave of volunteers centered on our expectations of
them, their expectations of themselves and their counterpart
businesses' expectations. In most instances, volunteers have
unrealistic expectations: &ldquo;my counterpart company will be listed
on the NASDAQ when I finish&rdquo;, &ldquo;having people approach me on a
daily basis asking for money will not bother me&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I have a
stomach of steel&rdquo;.</p><p>Training skills have also turned out to be critical. At
Geekcorps headquarters in North Adams, Massachusetts volunteers
review adult learning cycles and learning styles and follow up with
a hands-on training that involves teaching basic computer skills.
Hands-on training gives volunteers the opportunity to re-examine
their approach to training and learning, especially at the basic
skill level. While their counterparts in Ghana are beyond the
basics, their understanding of technology is often piecemeal or
weighted in one specific topic. Volunteers need to transfer their
skills thoroughly enough so as to be sustainable, and dynamically
enough to keep people excited about the practical applications that
will improve their businesses.</p><p>After they arrive in Ghana, training is taken up by our
country director, Stophe Landis. Volunteers are no longer in their
comfort zone and begin to understand what they have gotten into.
This portion of the training focuses on concrete work and culture
issues. An example is the scavenger hunt volunteers play on their
second or third day in-country. Volunteers are instructed to find a
place in Accra (the capital of Ghana) such as a landmark,
restaurant or company, with incomplete information and little
guidance.</p><p>To a great extent, Geekcorps volunteers are self-selected
risk takers (&ldquo;sure, I'll entrust you with my life!&rdquo;),
jacks-of-all-trades (&ldquo;sure, I can make this laser pointer into a
scanner that runs on biogas!&rdquo;) and theory-oriented. Thus the
training has to address the needs of this particular subset of
traits. I realized this one afternoon when I was facilitating a
culture exercise titled &ldquo;Universal-Cultural-Personal&rdquo;. The
exercise is used to clarify what behaviors can be categorized under
the above headings. I found myself entering into an argument that
threatened to escalate into a screaming match because several
volunteers claimed that eating on a regular basis can be construed
as a cultural, not a universal trait. I realized that while this
obfuscation of the exercise frustrated me, the volunteers really
liked turning the construct around and looking at it from all
angles. Why? Just because it seemed interesting from a theoretical
standpoint.</p><p>What hopefully emerges out of the Geekcorps training is a
volunteer who is more self-aware, more tolerant of ambiguity in
every realm of his or her own life, better able to cope with things
like no running water, able to live without T1 connectivity, able
to help businesses achieve a solution that is appropriate to that
environment and not afraid to engage with the people around them,
no matter how unfamiliar.</p><p>You can read more about the training program, the work
projects and sundry extracurricular activities from the volunteer's
