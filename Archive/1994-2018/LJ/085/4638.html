games has, at some point, sat down with a copy of some version of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity</em></span> and tried it out. For some, the lure
of godlike power over an entire city paled in comparison to the
blood and gore of their favorite first-person shooters. (It does
take a certain someone to try to organize the myriad workings and
economics of an entire city when they could just as easily run
around blasting bad guys with plasma rifles in a space arena
somewhere.) Some of us, however, have sat down with a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity</em></span> variant only to snap out of our
game-induced stupor half a day later, finding ourselves the mayor
of a city with a quarter-million happy citizens. For us, these
top-down, huge-scale simulated world games could be laced with
narcotics and not have any more appeal, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity 3000
Unlimited</em></span> is the best of the best in a game genre it
helped to create.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x197bce8"></a>The Story</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity 3000 Unlimited</em></span> is the latest
installment in what has become Maxis' flagship series and is the
first to make it to Linux. There is no real story line, per se,
though it is playable in short bursts in games with specific goals.
As we'll talk about in a minute, the most powerful
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity 3000</em></span> addictions come from its prowess
in open-ended games that allow players to build an entire
metropolis completely from scratch. You start with a little money
and a plot of land that you get to modify to your own personal
specifications. Then you start creating your city, zoning areas for
the desired type of development in the area, implementing an array
of complex civil engineering feats and performing various city
management duties, like balancing a budget, implementing taxation
on your citizens, passing ordinances, etc. As you get more money
from taxation, your city grows organically (you get more money, you
expand your city in a way that attracts people, more people move
in, you get more money), and through dealings with other nearby
cities, you can create relationships to facilitate your city's
growth. In this mode of play, the game is basically done when you
think you've accomplished all you can with the design you've
chosen. Then you go back and start again, using lessons you've
learned from previous cities to make your new city even
better.</p><p>New for <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity 3000 Unlimited</em></span> is the
ability to again play &ldquo;scenarios&rdquo;, a feature found on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity 2000</em></span> but notably absent in the first
release of <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity 3000</em></span> (the non-Unlimited
version). These thirteen new scenarios basically put you in a
specific situation in a prebuilt city and challenge you to use your
expert leadership skills to save the day. For example, in the
&ldquo;Criminalville&rdquo; scenario, mobs haven taken over Moscow, and it's
your job to sort out the mess and give them what they want. In
&ldquo;Fall of the Wall&rdquo;, you must connect East and West Berlin and
&ldquo;bring balance to the city&rdquo;. Some of these scenarios are quite
easy and can be played in 45 minutes to an hour, while others will
have you biting your lip in frustration at 4

fiscal and physical management of a huge metropolis,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity 3000 Unlimited</em></span>'s game play may seem
complex at first. If you've played a <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity</em></span>
version before, the overall feel will be quite close to that,
though there are some evolutionary interface enhancements that will
seem natural to a veteran. If you've never played
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity</em></span> before (what planet are you from
again?), the controls may seem a bit much at first. However, they
will become as natural as breathing with minimal effort on your
part. Maxis has gone to great pains to make
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity</em></span>'s interface as user-friendly and
intuitive as possible.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4638f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Maxis has gone to great pains to make the interface as
user-friendly as possible.
</p></div></div><p>At the start of the game, you're able to model the
approximately 100 square miles of landscape to your own personal
specifications and to a high degree of detail. No longer are you
limited to simply settling for a randomly generated map; with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SC3U</em></span>, you can create a random map or edit
every feature (from mountains, to lakes, to trees or anything else)
of a map of your choosing, <span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> you can opt to
use a map based on the topographies of several famous cities, such
as Bonn, London and Boston. You can also opt for the types of
terrain you want your selected landscape to be placed on (from
desert to snow-covered), what style of buildings will be built and
even which of the five available varieties of plant life will grow
in your world. The grid's appearance is <span   class="emphasis"><em>highly</em></span>
customizable; not only can the basic types of buildings be chosen,
but <span   class="emphasis"><em>SC3U</em></span>'s Building Replacement Manager allows
you to swap out old-style buildings you don't like for new ones of
your choosing. Don't like any of the seemingly endless array of
prefabricated buildings available to you? Use <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity
3000</em></span>'s Building Architect Plus to modify existing
buildings or create your own complex structures from scratch using
BAP's 3-D building creation environment. Remember now, this isn't
the game, just the options available to <span   class="emphasis"><em>play</em></span>
the game. While this level of complexity may not appeal to
everyone, it's nice to know it's an option if you want it.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4638f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Total Control: <span  class="emphasis"><em>SC3U</em></span>'s Terrain Editor
</p></div></div><p>The game itself is played continuously (though it can be
paused) as your city grows. You create and control everything from
transportation infrastructure (subways, trains, roads, airports,
seaports, etc.) to the placement of landmarks, from outfitting and
maintaining the police department to managing your city's water
supply and running appropriate plumbing to your neighborhoods.
You're in charge of controlling pollution and dealing with the
city's garbage problems. You must zone your city appropriately to
attract a balance of residents with industry for them to work in
and commercial businesses for them to spend their hard-earned cash
in. (There are even three types of each of these zones&mdash;low, medium
and dense&mdash;corresponding to the types of businesses/residences
you're looking to build in a given area.) You still control
taxation, but this is no longer your only source of income; you can
pass ordinances that will make your city money (allowing gambling
and casinos, for example) and/or generally make your city a better
place. You can also make special trade agreements with nearby
cities to put money in your pocket. For instance, is your water
system more than adequate for your city's current needs? Why not
sell some of that water to a neighbor for a while? To keep the
mayor apprised with the latest information as the game progresses,
you're kept up to date by a scrolling ticker along the bottom of
your screen, which is actually a refreshing change from the
somewhat irritating newspaper-style information windows that would
occasionally pop up in earlier versions. You also have a staff of
advisors who freely offer their opinions to you from time to time
and who are available to consult with when you are uncertain about
how to proceed.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4638f3.large.jpg"><img src="4638f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Consulting with Advisors and Balancing a Budget in Tokyo
</p></div></div><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>SC3U</em></span> graphics are superb. Each
building is actually created in a 3-D environment with painstaking
detail. You'll find more than 400 different varieties of buildings
(hundreds more than previous <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity</em></span>
versions). What's more, if you decide halfway through the game that
you want to switch on the fly to a completely different style of
architecture (say, from European to Asian), you can do it with the
press of a mouse button. You can even build any of the dozens of
included real-life landmarks like the World Trade Center, United
Nations building or the Eiffel Tower to spruce up your city's
skyline. Also, the in-game animations are just awesome. The
Thanksgiving parades are optional, but when you choose to have
them, zoom in for a close view and what you'll see is nothing short
of amazing; full screens of people, marching bands, shriners in
little cars, floats and even those huge inflated parade balloons;
all taking their time to meander down your streets from one end of
town to the other. This level of attention to detail is really one
of the main reasons <span   class="emphasis"><em>SC3U</em></span> looks so good.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4638f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Create Your Own Structures with the Building Architect
Plus
</p></div></div><p>Find that your city is looking just <span   class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span>
good and you want another challenge? Why not unleash one of the
many canned disasters on your city and then try to clean up the
mess? There are four new disasters in <span   class="emphasis"><em>SC3U</em></span> not
found in earlier versions, as well as a great collection of old
favorites, from riots to plagues of locusts to Armageddon-like
space debris. If you want to make it interesting (or are just
feeling destructive), the fine folks at Maxis have given you the
tools to do it.</p><p>The music is, well, it's Maxis&mdash;you sort of expect the music
to be a bit weird. It's soft and soothing and prone to put you in a
trancelike state of mayoral bliss for extended periods of time, but
it <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> get old after a while. I found myself
switching off the computer speakers to help me concentrate from
time to time. Again, this isn't a cut on the music per se, it is
well-done music, but <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> music would probably
start to get old after the half-days of gaming that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>SC3U</em></span> can induce.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x1c87e40"></a>Linux Notes</h2></div></div><p>I tested this on a G400-based VA workstation with 128MB RAM
and a 500MHz PIII as well as a GeForce-based system with 256MB RAM
and an 550MHz PIII, and both systems handled the game with little
difficulty. Though the game doesn't require any 3-D support, the
calculations required for simulating a 100-square-mile city can be
rather taxing, and once you get to higher levels of development,
the slowdown in movement around the screen and zoom redraws start
to become more and more noticeable. Loki lists the minimum hardware
requirements as a Pentium 233 and 32MB of RAM; while these numbers
may make sense for many small-scale cities, I think more advanced
users (or users of some of the truly monstrous scenario cities)
might find it nearly impossible to construct massive cityscapes
with those computational limitations. Loki recommends that you run
this game in 16bpp color mode to eliminate the on-the-fly
conversions that must occur if you use 24 or 32bpp color modes. If
you want to use the Building Architect Plus tool, you'll need to
use an OpenGL-compliant 3-D driver of some sort (both my NVidia
OpenGL drivers and Mesa had no problem at all with the BAP tool).
You'll want to have an OSS-compatible sound card and a minimum of
450MB of disk space for the install (a full install will run up
around 650MB or so). In general, the requirements of this game
really are pretty low compared to the return you get in game play.
I've run this gem on my little 500MHz laptop often and find it is
just as playable there as on any workstation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1883580.0x1c87f48"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>It's the best version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity</em></span> yet,
with more levels of customization, more add-ons, more options,
better graphics and better game play than ever before. The game is,
perhaps, somewhat complex by its very nature, and if you're looking
for a simple game, this probably isn't your bag. However, if you
enjoy the idea of some planning and strategy, and if you enjoy a
fun mental challenge that is hugely rewarding, this is your game.
In my opinion, this is probably a must-have for most Linux
gamers.</p><p><a href="4638s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p><p><a href="4638s2.html" target="_self">Just the FAQs Please</a></p></div></div>
