<i >LJ</i> History

</p><p>In the June 1996 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
we wrote that in addition to support for IA32, Amiga, and Atari,
Linux is &ldquo;being ported to several more platforms, including Alpha,
ARM, MIPS and PowerPC.&rdquo; Five years later, not only are these
supported but also SuperH, SPARC and UltraSPARC, the S/390, VAX,
PA-RISC, IA64, ColdFire, DragonBall, ETRAX, i960 and a host of
others.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1326580.0x1416860"></a>Microsoft and PHP gain in Netcraft
survey</h2></div></div><p>At this point it almost goes without saying that the
predominant web server is Apache, which has had the top market
share across all domains since early 1996, holding at better than
60% for the last year&mdash;according to Netcraft who has been studying
the matter since September 1995. Back then the top server by a huge
margin was NCSA's, which flatlined at approximately zero in
1999.</p><p>Apache is still doing fine, but it dropped by 1.29% in
January of this year, Netcraft reports. Microsoft's IIS gained
1.82%, and Sun's iPlanet, the third-place server, dropped .29%.
Both Apache, and Microsoft gained in absolute numbers. Netcraft
found 16,207,982 domains served by Apache and 5,903,512 served by
Microsoft. But there were other developments behind those details.
Netcraft reports,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The relatively static market share for Microsoft
on the Web as a whole contrasts sharply with its progress in our
companion SSL Server survey where Microsoft makes consistent and
relentless gains, month after month, and now accounts for 49% of
the sites performing encrypted transactions on the Internet.
Arguably, Microsoft's applications have made the difference, with
there being no straightforward alternative to Microsoft's Commerce
Server in the UNIX world.</p></blockquote></div><p>Netcraft also reveals that PHP is being adopted at an
extremely rapid pace:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The PHP module is compiled into the Apache server
on over five million web sites, or approaching 40% of all Apache
sites. Although PHP will only be in use on a fraction of these
sites currently, it is regarded as easier to program than Perl or
JSP and has created a broad developer community in a relatively
short space of time. PHP, together with MySQL and Apache, has
become the de facto way of developing web applications in the Linux
environment, in a similar way to the IIS/ASP/SQL-server combination
in the Microsoft world.</p></blockquote></div><p>The Netcraft survey can be found at

Big Bux</h2></div></div><p>None of the Big Boys have gone as gaga over Big Tux as Big
Blue. We all know about the billion IBM plans to spend. We've heard
about the server division changes and the R&amp;D commitments.
We've seen the beanbag chairs rolled out for geeks at LinuxWorld
Expo.</p><p>But, that's not enough. We're talking about a huge crush
here: the kind that calls for big sloppy displays of unfettered
affection. But since large corporations aren't able to actually hug
and kiss (it would never get past Legal), IBM can't help doing what
comes only naturally to big old companies&mdash;advertise.</p><p>&ldquo;Peace, Love and Linux&rdquo; is the new campaign. It launches
with a love letter in the form of a Flash Q&amp;A on the Web.
Here's how it starts:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>What is &ldquo;Peace, Love and Linux?&rdquo;
</p><p>A rallying cry. A clear, enthusiastic synopsis of IBM's
excitement about Linux and support for the Linux community.</p><p>Why is IBM supporting Linux?</p><p>Because we admire it, we believe in it, we need it and it's
good for customers.</p><p>IBM's vision is to help build the business infrastructure of
the future, drive towards dynamic e-business and integrated,
intelligent infrastructure. The complexity and demands of this
vision are staggering, mind-boggling. We've looked hard at what it
will take to get there, and two facts have become clear.</p><p>First, we'll never get there without wide adoption of open
standards like Linux.</p><p>Second, that the complexity of the task is so great that IBM
simply can't do it alone. No company can do it alone (although some
still suggest otherwise). Only the concerted effort of the larger
technology community can make it happen. And only the Linux
movement can marshal that effort.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here's what IBM says to the natural skeptics that comprise,
frankly, our readership:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Is this collaboration idea real or just feel-good
stuff?
</p><p>Real. Very real. If you think it's just fluff, you've missed
the point.</p><p>IBM spends $5 billion a year on R&amp;D. And we're putting a
billion dollars behind Linux. But even all that is nothing compared
to what the Linux community will generate spontaneously.</p><p>This is a new way of looking at the world: companies,
alliances, partnerships and individuals working together, each
contributing their particular expertise to create a &ldquo;massively
parallel thinking&rdquo; force that is immeasurably more powerful than
any single entity, including IBM.</p></blockquote></div><p>As always with this kind of stuff, the lover holding out the
flowers makes a few little mistakes. For example, IBM doesn't
appear to know about the Linux community's allergy to GIFs. To
arrive at the love letter
(<a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/linux/passport.swf" target="_self">www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/linux/passport.swf</a>),
readers of IBM's Linux page have to click through a series of GIF
links. And, lots of us will be disappointed when we get there
because they don't run Flash, either.</p><p>So a little advice to the suitor here: maybe you could take
some of the web marketing money that's burning a hole in your
pocket and bang some of it on, say, the Open Source Initiative
(<a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_self">http://www.opensource.org/</a>).
They need it, and it'll help them accomplish a bunch of the
objectives you're bragging about.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1326580.0x1417468"></a>They Said It</h2></div></div><p>We've just spent 14 hours trying to get standards-compliant
code to work in standards-compliant browsers.</p><p>&mdash;Jeffrey Zeldman</p><p>The Linux issue is whether this is a fundamentally disruptive
technology, like the microprocessor and the Internet. We're betting
that it is.</p><p>&mdash;Irving Wladawsky-Berger of IBM</p><p>It's the business model around free software that concerns
us, where people get sucked into not paying for software. This will
be a disservice for them, as they need established, well-funded
companies to offer innovation.</p><p>&mdash;Doug Miller, group product manager for Microsoft's Windows

people.</p><p>&mdash;Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO</p><p>In this business, the only real open-industry standard in the
computer industry is Linux, which thankfully remains beyond the
clutches of the moguls. Everything else is hokum designed to lock
developers (and by extension, customers) into proprietary corners
