<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> a reference on the Python language now
exists. Part of Prentice Hall's PTR Core Series, this book works
well as a first Python textbook for computer science students,
while also being thumbable for work-a-day use by Python
programmers.</p><p>The book divides Python into two main parts. In Part I, about
500 pages explain the rudiments of Python: how to program in
Python, the syntax, data types and key language features, all
cleanly divided into 14 chapters. Each chapter is compartmentalized
yet is also incrementally linked to the others. Part II covers six
different advanced topics in as many chapters in a little under 200
pages. In Part II, the advanced chapters accomplish what most
Python books fail to do: show you integrated working examples of
how the language is used to solve real-world problems.</p><p>For students, Part II allows you to apply directly what you
learn from Part I, moving beyond just pushing what might initially
be abstract symbols and syntax. For developers or programmers, Part
II is a very nice HOWTO, which is strongly backed up by Part I as a
language reference. For all users, the book invites exploration and
satisfies your curiosity through modifying the copious examples.
Some in-depth examination will illustrate these points.</p><p>To introduce the basics, Part I has chapter topics titled
&ldquo;Welcome to Python!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo;, &ldquo;Syntax and Style&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Python Objects&rdquo;, &ldquo;Numbers&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sequences: Stings, Lists, and
Tuples&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dictionaries&rdquo;, &ldquo;Conditionals and Loops&rdquo;, &ldquo;Files and
Input/Output&rdquo;, &ldquo;Errors and Exceptions&rdquo;, &ldquo;Functions&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Modules&rdquo;, &ldquo;Classes and OOP&rdquo; and &ldquo;Execution
Environment&rdquo;.</p><p>The order of topics in Part I really simplifies learning
Python, especially if this is your first computer language. If
you've ever had a programming class before and used a text that has
exercises where you were forced to write code that did some silly
language-specific action, you'll be pleased to know that this is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> that kind of book. Plentiful, practical
examples are used as each topic develops; the exercises are a lot
more about exercising your creativity rather than some didactic
language feature. Consider this one of the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; computer
language books.</p><p>Because of the excellent depth presented in the introductory
topics, the material is also of value to practicing Python
programmers. For instance, most language books have tables and
lists about features that are broadly discussed in the text. This
book goes much further. The standard types in Python are explained
compellingly in terms of storage model, update model and access
model. These three simple concepts explain <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
of the possible interactions of data types in the language, doing
more to help understanding than dozens of pages of prose. And,
there are other examples of this kind of thought-provoking mastery
of Python. A flowchart explains how Python does numerical coercion
and is much easier to follow than any table or list. The best
explanation ever achieved of how Python does slicing of sequence
objects is shown using cartoons of soccer players. A lot of the
power of Python comes from lists and dictionaries. Interestingly,
explanations are given for what these objects do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> do, as well as for their capabilities.
These pages should be earmarked for reference use.</p><p>In Part II, we encounter the advanced topics. Again, this is
where the book excels: it actually shows you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> to do the programming for specific
application areas involving &ldquo;Regular Expressions&rdquo;, &ldquo;Network
Programming&rdquo;, &ldquo;Multithreading Programming&rdquo;, &ldquo;GUI Programming
with Tkinter&rdquo;, &ldquo;Web Programming&rdquo; and lastly, &ldquo;Extending
Python&rdquo; with alternative, compiled languages. In contrast to the
interlinked development of Part I, the chapters in Part II are more
individually self-supporting. They can be used as one has an
interest or need for the information. The chapter on
multithreading, in particular, is one of the only complete HOWTO
developments on this topic.</p><p>Mention must be made of the valuable appendices and the
index. Appendix A provides answers to selected exercises, for
self-checking or class use. Appendix B contains one of the most
comprehensive bibliographies of print and on-line references on
Python. The operators in Python are conveniently collected in one
place in Appendix C. The book keeps you completely up-to-date with
Appendix D, which previews the new language features of Python 2.0.
The index is impressively comprehensive at 17 pages in
length.</p><p>The two-part division of the material feels very appropriate.
For use as a textbook, the pacing and thoroughness are more than
adequate. As a reference book, the clean division of the subject,
plus a good index, allow rapid finding of any topic. A wide variety
of examples are used in each chapter. This markedly increases the
likelihood that something of salience matches your needs as a
programmer. And while opinions vary, I tend to prefer books that
offer a CD-ROM of multiplatform binaries and sources, as this one
does.</p></div></div>
