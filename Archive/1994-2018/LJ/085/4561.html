    Using nmap to test your system's potential weak points.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1464580.0x155c608"></a></h2></div></div><p>You may have heard horror stories about
how easy it is for evil system crackers to probe potential victims'
systems for vulnerabilities using software tools readily available
on the Internet. The bad news is, these stories are generally true.
The good news is, many of these tools are extremely useful (and
even designed) for the legitimate purpose of scanning
<span   class="emphasis"><em>your own</em></span> system for weaknesses.
</p><p>This and next month's column will explore some of the ways
ordinary system administrators and high-powered security
professionals alike can use <span   class="bold"><b>nmap</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>nessus</b></span>, two outstanding
open-source packages, to improve system security. But remember,
knowledge is power, and it's up to you to use it responsibly (and
in ways that won't compel any men in black to confiscate your
beloved Red Hat boxen).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1464580.0x155c870"></a>Why We (Good Guys) Scan</h2></div></div><p>Why scan? If you're a system cracker, you scan to determine
what services a system is running and to which well-known
vulnerabilities those services appear to be subject. If you're a
system administrator you scan for essentially the same reasons but
in the interest of fixing (or at least understanding) your systems,
not breaking into them.</p><p>It may sound odd for good guys to use the same tools as the
bad guys they're trying to thwart. After all, we don't test our
door locks by trying to kick in our own doors. But system security
is exponentially more complicated than physical security. It's
nowhere near as easy to gauge the relative security of a networked
computer system as it is the door to your house. While ideally we
should always know which network processes are active on every host
we administer, the fact is that in this age of hyper-connectedness
it's difficult to keep track of this information.</p><p>Therefore, we security-conscious geeks are obliged to take
seriously any tool that can provide some sort of sanity check, even
an incomplete and imperfect one (as is anything that tries to
measure a moving target like system security), despite or even
because of that tool's usefulness to the bad guys. However, we also
need to remember that neither a security scanner nor any other
single tool or technique will magically grant total security.
Repeat after me: security is a process, not a product.</p><p>Having said all that, there's one more reason we dig security
scanners: notoriety. It's fun to pretend to be a s00p3r 3L33T
HaX0r. Using tools like nmap and nessus while saying with a
straight face that we're &ldquo;working&rdquo; is priceless!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1464580.0x155ca80"></a>Types of Scans and Their Uses</h2></div></div><p>There are basically two types of system scans. Port scans
look for open TCP and UDP ports, for &ldquo;listening services&rdquo;.
Security scans go a step further and probe identified services for
known weaknesses. In terms of sophistication, doing a port scan is
like counting how many doors and windows a house has; running a
security scan is more like rattling all the doorknobs and checking
the windows for alarm-sensors.</p><p>Oh, I almost forgot ping sweeps, arguably a third kind of
scan. These are done to identify which IPs in a given range or
network are active (i.e., which hosts respond to pinging). While
this can be useful depending on the task at hand, in the interests
of keeping this month's column to a manageable level, I'll focus on
single-system port and security scanning. Everything we discuss
here applies whether you're scanning five hosts or 65,500.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1464580.0x155cbe0"></a>nmap, World Champion Port-Scanner</h2></div></div><p>The basic premise of port scanning is simple: if you try to
connect to a given port, you can determine whether that port is
closed/inactive or whether an application (i.e., web server, FTP
d&aelig;mon, etc.) is accepting connections there. As it happens,
it is easy to write a simple port-scanner that uses the local
connect( ) system call to TCP connections on various ports; with
the right modules, you can even do this with Perl. However, this
method also happens to be the most obtrusive and obvious way to
scan, and it tends to result in numerous log entries on one's
target systems.</p><p>Enter nmap, by Fyodor. nmap can do simple connect( ) scans if
you like, but its real thing is &ldquo;stealth scanning&rdquo;. Stealth
scanning involves the use of ersatz TCP packets designed to trigger
a response from each target system without actually completing a
TCP connection.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>nmap</b></span> supports not one, but
four different kinds of stealth scans in addition to TCP Connect
scanning, UDP scanning, RPC scanning, ping sweeps and even
operating system fingerprinting. It also boasts a number of
features more useful to black-hat than white-hat hackers, such as
FTP-bounce scanning, ACK scanning and Window firewall scanning, but
those are of little interest to <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s highly ethical readers. In short, nmap is by
far the most feature-rich and versatile port-scanner available
today.</p><p>Here, then, is a summary of the most important types of scans
nmap can do:</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>TCP Connect Scan</b></span>&mdash;uses the
OS's native connect( ) system call to attempt a full three-way TCP
handshake (SYN, ACK-SYN, ACK) on each probed port. A failed
connection (i.e., if the server replies to your SYN packet with an
ACK-RST packet) indicates a closed port. It doesn't require root
privileges and is one of the faster scanning methods. Not
surprisingly, however, most server applications will log
connections that are closed immediately after they're open, so this
is a fairly &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; scan.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>TCP SYN Scan</b></span>&mdash;two-thirds of
a TCP Connect scan; if the target returns an ACK-SYN packet, nmap
immediately sends an RST packet rather than completing the
handshake with an ACK packet. &ldquo;Half-open&rdquo; connections such as
these are far less likely to be logged, so SYN scanning is much
less perceptible than TCP Connect scanning. The trade-off is that
since nmap, rather than the kernel, builds these packets, you must
be root to run nmap in this mode.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>TCP FIN Scan</b></span>&mdash;rather than
even pretending to initiate a standard TCP connection, nmap sends a
single FIN (final) packet. If the target's TCP/IP stack is
RFC-793-compliant (MS-anything, HP-UX, IRIX, MVS and Cisco IOS are
not) then open ports will drop the packet and closed ports will
send an RST.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>TCP NULL Scan</b></span>&mdash;similar to a
FIN scan but instead a TCP-flagless packet (i.e., a null packet) is
sent. Also relies on the RFC-793-compliant behavior described
above.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>TCP Xmas Tree Scan</b></span>&mdash;similar
to a FIN scan but instead sends a packet with its FIN, PSH and URG
flags (final, push data and urgent, respectively) set. It also
relies on the RFC-793-compliant behavior described above.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>UDP Scan</b></span>&mdash;because UDP is a
connectionless protocol, i.e., there's no protocol-defined
relationship between packets in either direction, UDP has no
handshake to play with as in the TCP scans described above.
However, most OS' TCP/IP stacks will return an ICMP &ldquo;Port
Unreachable&rdquo; packet if a UDP packet is sent to a closed UDP port.
Thus, a port that doesn't return an ICMP packet can be assumed
open. Since neither the probe-packet nor its potential ICMP packet
are guaranteed to arrive (remember, UDP is connectionless and so is
ICMP) nmap will typically send several UDP packets per UDP probed
port to reduce false positives. In my experience the accuracy of
nmap's UDP scanning varies among target OSes, but it's better than
nothing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>RPC Scan</b></span>&mdash;used in
conjunction with other scan types, this feature will cause nmap to
attempt to determine which of the ports identified as open are
hosting RPC (remote procedure call) services, and what those
services and version numbers are.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ping Scan (Sweep)</b></span>&mdash;see
&ldquo;Types of Scans and Their Uses&rdquo; above.</p><p>Whew! Quite a list of scanning methods&mdash;and I've left out ACK
scans and Window scans (see the man page on nmap(1) if you're
interested). nmap has another very useful feature, OS
fingerprinting. Based on characteristics of a target's responses to
various arcane packets that nmap sends, nmap can make an educated
guess as to which operating system each target host is
running.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1464580.0x155d478"></a>Getting and Installing nmap</h2></div></div><p>So useful and popular is nmap that it is now included in most
Linux distributions. Red Hat 7.0 and Debian 2.2, my two current
flavors of choice, both come with nmap (under Applications/System
and Extra/Net, respectively). Therefore, the easiest way for most
Linux users to install nmap is via their system's package-manager
(e.g., RPM, dselect, YAST) and preferred OS installation-medium
(CD-ROM, FTP, etc.).</p><p>If, however, you want the very latest version of nmap and/or
its source code, both are available from
<a href="http://www.insecure.org" target="_self">http://www.insecure.org/</a>
(Fyodor's web site) in RPM and TGZ formats. Should you wish to
compile nmap from source, simply download and expand the tarball,
then enter these commands (allowing for any difference in the
expanded source code's directory-name; nmap v2.53 may be obsolete
by the time you read this):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd nmap-2.53
./configure
make
make install
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1464580.0x155d688"></a>Using nmap</h2></div></div><p>There are two different ways to run nmap. The most powerful
and flexible way is via the command prompt. There is also a GUI
called nmapfe, which constructs and executes an nmap for you (see
Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4561f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Sample nmapfe Session
</p></div></div><p>This GUI is useful for quick-and-dirty scans or as an aid to
learning nmap's command-line syntax. However, I strongly recommend
learning nmap proper since the GUI presents only a subset of nmap's
features. Besides, it's overkill to fire up X for little old
nmap.</p><p>The nmap commands are easy to learn. The basic syntax for
simple scans is: nmap -s (scan-type) -p (port-range options)
(target). The -s flag is immediately followed by one of the
following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>T: TCP Connect Scan</p></li><li><p>S: TCP SYN Scan</p></li><li><p>F: TCP FIN Scan</p></li><li><p>N: TCP NULL Scan</p></li><li><p>X: TCP Xmas Tree Scan</p></li><li><p>U: UDP Scan (can be combined with above)</p></li><li><p>R: RPC Scan (can be combined with above)</p></li></ul></div><p>The -s flag, which specifies which type or types of scan to
run, can be followed by any of the TCP scan-types, U for UDP
scanning, R for RPC scanning/identification or any combination of
these three groups of flags. Only one TCP scan-type may be
specified in a given session, however. If the -s flag is omitted
altogether, the default scan-type is TCP Connect.
</p><p>For example, -sSUR tells nmap to perform a SYN scan, a UDP
scan and finally an RPC scan/identification on the specified
target(s). -sTSR would fail, however, since TCP Connect and TCP SYN
are both TCP scans.</p><p>If you state a port range using the -p flag, you can combine
commas and dashes to create a very specific group of ports to be
scanned. For example, typing <b  >-p
20-23,80,53,600-1024</b> tells nmap to scan the ports 20
through 23, 80, 53 and 600-1024. Don't use any spaces in your port
range, however.</p><p>Similarly, the &ldquo;target&rdquo; expression can be a hostname, a
host IP address, a network IP address or a range of IP addresses.
For example typing <b  >192.168.17.*</b> expands to all
255 IP addresses in the network&mdash;192.168.17.0/24 (in fact, you
could use <b  >192.168.17. 0/24</b> instead);
<b  >10.13.[1,2,4].*</b> expands to 10.13.1.0/24,
10.13.2.0/24, and 10.13.4.0/24. As you can see, nmap is very
flexible in the types of target expressions it can
understand.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1464580.0x1956430"></a>Reality Check I: Some Simple Sample
Scans</h2></div></div><p>Before we go any further, let's examine some basic scans that
use the flags we've discussed so far. The examples in this section
all use nmap version 2.53 (the most current as of this writing)
running on Red Hat 7.0. The target system in these examples is
running Windows98 with Sambar web server installed and active for
good measure.</p><p>First, suppose we want nmap to perform an &ldquo;all-default&rdquo;
scan. We're not required to provide any flags if we don't want to;
given nothing more than a target IP or IP expression, nmap will
ping each target host and then scan it using the TCP Connect method
on (destination) ports 0-1024 plus all other ports listed in
/usr/share/nmap/nmap-services (your path to this file may vary),
for a total of 1,523 TCP ports. Listing 1 shows what such an
all-default scan looks like when run against a Windows98
system.</p><p><a href="4561l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. An &ldquo;All-Defaults&rdquo; nmap
Scan</a></p><p>Note that it took only two seconds to query 1,523 ports. When
I said the TCP Connect method is fast, I wasn't just whistling
&ldquo;Dixie&rdquo;.</p><p>For our next example scan, suppose we want to add UDP to the
mix, and while we're at it, we want to see if any of the open ports
we find are running RPC applications. Since we want to do UDP port
scanning in addition to, and not instead of, TCP Connect scanning,
we'll need to say so explicitly. Our command and its input will
look like Listing 2.</p><p><a href="4561l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Nmap Scan Using TCP
Connect, UDP and RPC Modes</a></p><p>The -sU and -sR scans (combined above in -sTUR) go
particularly well together: RPC is a UDP-intensive protocol. When
nmap finds an RPC service on an open port, it appends the RPC
application's name in parentheses, including the version number if
nmap can make a credible guess at one.</p><p>Suppose we're looking for something a bit more specific. This
could be because we have some idea of what the host is running
and/or we wish to minimize the scan time. To specify which ports we
want to see, we append the -p flag along with a list of ports.
Commas and dashes, but not white space, may be used in this list.
Listing 3 shows a scan in which we check all privileged ports
(1-1024) plus a few high ports we're worried about, namely TCP
12345 and 12346 (NetBus' default ports) and UDP 31337
(BackOrifice's default):</p><p><a href="4561l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Scanning for TCP and UDP
on Selected Ports</a></p><p>Finally, because it's so easy, let's do a scan on multiple
hosts. The host expression nmap accepts is even more flexible than
the port expression: wild cards, square brackets (lists) and
&ldquo;slash/subnet-bits&rdquo; notation may be used. Here's what the command
would look like to perform the scan in Listing 3 on my entire test
network (254 addresses, output omitted this time):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nmap -sTU -p 1-1024,12345,12346,31336 10.13.13.0/24
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1464580.0x19569b0"></a>Intermediate nmap</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>nmap</b></span> sports a frightening
array of features designed to sneak through firewalls, avoid
triggering intrusion-detection software and otherwise help the user
evade detection. I feel no urge whatsoever to discuss those
features here; while no doubt they have legitimate uses, I'd like
to spend the remainder of this article on a few nifty features that
are less obviously cracker-oriented.</p><p>Suppose you're the administrator of a large network and
someone installs a server in your machine room that appears to be
reachable from the Internet, in possible violation of your
organization's security policy (and/or to your indignation since
you weren't asked for permission). Before going on an
authority-asserting rampage, you decide to first find out as much
as you can about the possible risks to which your network has been
exposed.</p><p>Luckily, the mystery server has an IP address scrawled on its
front in purple crayon. Equally luckily, you're a righteous nmap
angel of vengeance because you read &ldquo;Paranoid Penguin&rdquo; this
month. Here are some nmap options to help you find out just what's
going on.</p><p>First, what OS is this beast running? OS fingerprinting,
summoned by the -O flag, may tell you. When you use -O, nmap sends
packets with various TCP options set and compares the replies it
receives with its OS fingerprinting database
(/usr/share/nmap/nmap-os-fingerprints on my Red Hat 7.0 system). In
my experience this feature works extremely well, except on MacOS 8
(which seems to stump it).</p><p>Next, are any of the active ports running services with root
privileges? Obviously some services need this much privilege but
many don't; if the web server on this box is running as root,
someone is going to need talking to for sure. Use the -I flag to
have nmap query the target's ident d&aelig;mon, whose sole purpose
is to tell the world which user owns each listening service.</p><p>Can we minimize the chances an overly aggressive scan will
overload the target system or the network? Oh yes. The -T flag
allows us to specify a timing mode; the options are Paranoid,
Sneaky, Polite, Normal, Aggressive and Insane, in increasing degree
of network-unfriendliness (based on how long nmap waits between
packets and whether it sends packets serially or in batches). -T
Polite is a good choice if you want to go easy on your target
and/or network.</p><p>How do we do a fast scan that checks for likely services
without scanning all privileged ports? The -F flag tells nmap to
scan only those ports listed in nmap-services. In this way, we
avoid ports unlikely to yield anything interesting.</p><p>Finally, is there an easy way to save our evidence of
lameness as a text file? Typing <b  >-oN
<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b> tells nmap to write
its results to a text file. If we want nmap to use HaX0r Sp3ll1ng,
we can use <b  >-oS
<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b> instead (&ldquo;S&rdquo; is for
&ldquo;Script-Kiddie-Talk&rdquo;).</p><p>In Listing 4 we see the unauthorized server is accepting
connections for, among other things, Secure Shell, Telnet,
HTTP/SSL, LPD, X and nessus. nessus? Why, that's a security
scanner. You definitely don't want internet hosts able to reach a
nessus server on your network&mdash;that just happens to be the topic of
next month's column.</p><p><a href="4561l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Using Some Intermediate
Features</a></p><p>As powerful as nmap is, nessus gives us a means of going a
step further and probing all these listening-ports nmap has found
for known weaknesses. Again, we'll focus on using these powerful
tools for good rather than evil; in the meantime, I hope you'll do
the same with nmap.</p><p><a href="4561s1.html" target="_self">Um, What's the Port?</a></p><p><a href="4561s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
