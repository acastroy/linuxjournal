    A review of the LPIC process.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1022580.0x111a6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>As the Linux community has grown from the
world of the hobbyist to include professional administrators, the
infrastructure of the community and marketplace has evolved to
support this rapid growth. We now have numerous Linux periodicals,
reference books, web sites and significant corporate involvement.
In recent months, the idea of a certification process to quantify
the skills of system administrators has also become quite popular
in the Linux community. Numerous information technology companies
such as Sun, Cisco, Novell and Microsoft have had popular
certification programs for their own particular product lines for
some time.
</p><p>Several current certification programs try to gauge the skill
level of Linux system administrators via testing. The more
well-known programs include Red Hat's RHCE, Sair's GNU/Linux
Certification and Linux Professional Institute's LPIC.</p><p>Recently I took the first-level Linux Professional Institute
Certification exam (101). The following is a brief overview of the
program and also a review of my experience with the exam and
preparation materials.</p><p>My background is varied, but I have been working with UNIX
systems in some limited form for about seven years, first doing
data conversions and later working with database applications. I
have been using Linux for about three and a half years. Primarily a
Red Hat and Mandrake user, I have lately begun to fiddle with the
Debian distribution in my spare time. Once an ardent user of RPM
(Red Hat's package manager), I now see the beauty of Debian's
apt-get commands. For more important programs, I tend to compile
from source rather than using packages. But I don't compile and
install every single released kernel; in fact, before the stable
2.4 kernel arrived, I hadn't compiled a kernel in months. For me,
Linux is about the freedom and flexibility I find in using and
developing Linux applications daily, not loading the latest
development kernel to look for bugs (though many people do this,
and Linux is better for their efforts).</p><p>In my current job, I do a mix of programming (Perl for CGI,
DBI and shell scripting), system administration and implementation.
As the webmaster of the northern Virginia Linux Users' Group and
Tux.Org, I get to dig into topics such as Apache web server
configuration and DNS. At home, I once had a Linux box with 380
days of uptime and currently use Linux for all of my day-to-day
work. This includes reading e-mail, writing code, compiling
programs&mdash;pretty much everything. I have a small network there with
a gateway machine and six machines behind it. In summary, I am
comfortable with most basic administration topics.</p><p>My motivation in taking the certification test was two-fold.
I hoped to quantify my Linux knowledge, which was gained with
little formal training. Plus, the certification would surely make a
nice addition to my r&eacute;sum&eacute;.</p><p>I chose the Linux Professional Institute Certification
program over the other options because of its apparent vendor and
distribution neutrality. The Linux Professional Institute has
support and input from a wide array of sources. These include
Caldera, IBM, Linuxcare, Silicon Graphics, SuSE, Hewlett-Packard
and VA Linux Systems, among others. The LPI advisory council of
over fifty members reads like a roll call of the well-known members
of the community.</p><p>The LPI certification process consists of three levels, each
requiring successful completion of two tests. Each level has a
numeric designation for its tests, 101, 102, 201, 202 and so
on.</p><p>LPI outlines a body of knowledge with specific skills at each
certification level. For example, according to the LPI web site, to
be successful with a Level 1 exam, you should be able to complete
the following tasks: work from the UNIX command line; perform easy
maintenance tasks such as helping users, adding users to a larger
system, backing up, restoring, shutting down and rebooting; install
and configure a work station (including X) and connect it to the
LAN or a standalone PC via modem to the Internet.</p><p>As such, the Level 1 detailed objectives list addresses the
technology behind these tasks and the mechanics of performing them.
For example, part of the detailed objective for setting up the X
Window System reads:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Obj 1: Install and Configure XFree86&mdash;Verify that
the video card and monitor are supported by an X server, install
the correct X server, configure the X server, install an X font
server, install required fonts for X (may require a manual edit of
/etc/X11/XF86Config in the Files section), customize and tune X for
video card and monitor.
</p><p>Commands: XF86Setup, xf86config.</p><p>Files: /etc/X11/XF86Config, .xresources.</p></blockquote></div><p>The full set of detailed objectives appears quite
comprehensive and representative of the Linux tasks a system
administrator might face on the job. The structure of the material
on the LPIC web site was logical and straightforward. It provided a
good system for easily reviewing a small chunk of related
materials, rather than requiring great effort to pick out the
relevant material.
</p><p>At the time I began this process, there were two LPIC
preparation books available. I purchased both, mostly to get a feel
for the format of the tests and to use as a concise list of topics
to be reviewed. These books were <span   class="emphasis"><em>General Linux 1 Exam
Prep</em></span>, published by the Coriolis Group and <span   class="emphasis"><em>LPIC
Prep Kit 101</em></span>, published by Que.</p><p>The Coriolis book ($49.99 US) had good content for reviewing
administration topics, and I even learned some neat things by
reading it. The book provides a review of the topics in both the
101 and 102 exams, so I only had to read half of it for this first
exam. Each chapter reviews its topics thoroughly and provides a
practice test at the end. However, the practice tests are full of
errors, typographical and otherwise. For example, in a question
that has possible answers of A, B, C or D, the answer key states
that the answer is 10. I got the feeling this book was really
rushed to market. The accompanying CD-ROM of practice tests has a
clunky and amateurish feel. I checked the Coriolis web site for an
errata page for this book but did not find one.</p><p>The Que book ($39.99 US) has clear, concise content, but the
CD-ROM of practice tests is a technical abomination. For example,
while taking a practice test, if you need to review or change a
previous answer and then move forward to continue the test, the
program falls into a nasty little loop. The same question is
presented to you repeatedly, while the test program still expects
the answers to the questions that should be there. The only
solution is to kill the test program and start over. It was
frustrating, to say the least.</p><p>Working around these technical hurdles, I did the practice
tests twice, a few weeks apart, and noted my errors. I restudied
the areas where my knowledge was weakest, read applicable man pages
and tried out unfamiliar commands and tools.</p><p>Besides studying for the exam itself, I had to make an
appointment at a local testing center and pay the required fee.
Each of the six LPIC exams costs $100 US. The LPIC exams are
administered through VUE (Virtual University Enterprises), which
also administers numerous other certifications exams.</p><p>To register, I used the VUE web site to set up a VUE login
and password. The web site has a nice interface for choosing a
nearby testing center and making an appointment for the exam. I
paid the $100 fee by credit card and received an exam appointment
confirmation and payment receipt a few hours later via e-mail&mdash;all
very simple and straightforward.</p><p>Having registered and paid the fee, I arrived on the assigned
date to take my exam. I was given 90 minutes to complete a
computer-based selection of 60 questions. The format of the
questions included a mix of multiple-choice, &ldquo;choose all answers
that apply&rdquo; and short answer fill-in-the-blank.</p><p>The 60 questions, apparently chosen at random, did not allow
me to be tested evenly (or at all in some areas) on the many facets
of administering a Linux system. I do not remember seeing a single
question on how to back up a system. A certain number of questions
from every section in the LPI &ldquo;detailed objectives&rdquo; would have
been more accurate in testing my overall knowledge, even if it made
the exam longer.</p><p>I felt the exam questions placed too much emphasis on knowing
arcane and often little-used options for many system commands,
though this may be the result of my particular type of experience.
In my exam, there were numerous questions on text filters and the
use of sed and regular expressions. In all honesty, I have yet to
create a regular expression in my work without a couple of passes
to get it exactly right.</p><p>The testing software (Windows-based) provided a comment
mechanism, so I commented on many of the questions heavily,
critiquing confusing wording and undefined scope. In general, I
found the test questions confusing and, in many cases, downright
misleading&mdash;something I cannot completely attribute to a lack of
knowledge on my part. I hope others commented on the questions and
that the comments made their way back to LPI for
consideration.</p><p>Finally, I did not receive a grade when I completed the test.
The attendant at the testing center handed me a page that told me
the exam was in beta testing, and results would be mailed to me in
6 to 12 weeks. LPIC eventually scored the exam and mailed me the
score four months after the test date. I did pass the exam, with a
score of 540 on a scale of 200-800.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1022580.0x111b108"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>My knowledge is not where it could be, and I continue to
learn every day. But, the exams still need considerable improvement
to be considered a fair assessment of an administrator's skills. I
believe the work is actively underway at LPI to improve the
certification exams. Even with the minor difficulties, this
certification program is still my choice over the others, mostly
due to the wide support and vendor neutrality of the
program.</p><p>Computerized testing doesn't allow one the luxury of fiddling
with the options to obtain an exact result (like regular
expressions) and thus was not a good mechanism for testing some
areas of system administration, where bizarre and varied problems
are encountered daily. Other exams may have a more practical
approach in challenging you to fix a broken system within an
allotted time period.</p><p>In summary, taking the LPIC exams can be a good personal
assessment of system administrator knowledge even though
quantifying that via a computerized exam may not be entirely
perfect. Plus, I feel that certifications, along with strong and
relevant experience cannot hurt your chances in our competitive
world. I recently registered for the 102 exam to be taken
soon.</p><p><a href="4630s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
