</p><p>Let's talk about the software business. We'll start with
Microsoft. Hey, it isn't 2010 yet. If we're going to talk about the
software business in 2001, we have to address the incumbent Kahuna.
It isn't easy in any case, and this past February, Jim Allchin, who
runs Microsoft's platform products group, made it a lot harder. In
an interview with Bloomberg, he called Linux &ldquo;an intellectual
property destroyer&rdquo; and open source a &ldquo;threat&rdquo; to &ldquo;the American
way&rdquo;, among other wacky, paranoid things.</p><p>This draws attention away from much slower and less newsy
changes happening at Microsoft for years and away from signs that
the company is noticing its markets are fully networked and,
therefore, behaving progressively less like &ldquo;targets&rdquo; for
marketing messages and disposable consumer electronics&mdash;and more
like bazaars.</p><p>A bazaar is a real market: a chaotic and noisy public place
where all the reciprocal abstractions of economics&mdash;supply and
demand, production and consumption&mdash;are a handshake apart. In real
markets, clues from customers have a lot more impact on vendors
than any vendor's &ldquo;marketing strategy&rdquo; has on &ldquo;consumers&rdquo;.
Since marketing likes to be &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; and doesn't like to touch
customers (that's sales' job), it becomes progressively more
useless in the bazaar environment. &ldquo;Consumer marketing&rdquo; becomes
an antique conceit, and something else takes its place; something
that involves participation in markets at a much deeper, more
organic level.</p><p>Something similar started to happen at Microsoft in the
summer of 1996, when the company did an unusually clueful thing:
they created unmoderated Usenet newsgroups for every one of their
major products. Suddenly there were conversational zones where
customers, employees and everybody else could say what they
pleased. Some people posted suspicions that Microsoft had created a
habitat for astroturfing or otherwise spinning untruths about its
products (something the company has since been accused of doing in
other venues). But employees jumped in and encouraged honest
exchanges. They wanted to know as much as possible about how their
products worked in the real world. A Microsoft executive at the
time told me this was &ldquo;Marketing 101&rdquo; and expressed surprise that
competitors weren't doing the same kind of thing.</p><p>However, Marketing 101 in those days was still mostly an
academic exercise. Theodore Levitt taught that the purpose of
marketing was &ldquo;to satisfy the customer no matter what&rdquo;. For all
the clues it got from Usenet and tech support calls, Microsoft
continued to make crash-prone operating systems. With good
reason&mdash;they sold by the zillions. Money spoke and the market
approved.</p><p>Starting in February 1998 though, the market started to speak
in forms other than money. This was when Salon.com published the
results of a &ldquo;Haiku Error Message&rdquo; contest. Within minutes of
publication, the winning haikus were being mailed and posted all
over the world. Although it didn't win first prize, this one by
Peter Rothman unleashed one of the most viral memes in the history
of the Net:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Windows NT crashed.I am the Blue Screen of
Death.No one hears your screams.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thanks to the Net, everybody's screams became one huge joke.
Windows became a target of mass mockery. Worse, it became a mirror
in which it mocked itself. Look up &ldquo;blue screen of death&rdquo; in a
search engine and near the top of the list you'll find a page
(<a href="http://www.daimyo.org/bsod" target="_self">http://www.daimyo.org/bsod/</a>)
where Matt Michie (who works at Linux.com) keeps a rogues' gallery
of public BSODs. He has shots of giant Las Vegas electronic
billboards, ATMs, promotional marquees, airport arrival/departure
displays and casino game machines. Naturally many of the same
pictures appear on lots of other sites. Memes are like that. And
the bigger the bazaar, the faster word spreads through it.
</p><p>At some point, the din of clues overwhelms everything else.
Clearly this happened last summer when Jim Allchin went on
sabbatical with a bunch of friends in a boat. Recently, he told me
he learned two things on the trip that amazed him: 1) how many
different kinds of things people want to do with PCs; and 2) how
much trouble they have making their PCs work. He called the
experience &ldquo;humbling&rdquo; and said he was &ldquo;more determined than ever
to do something about it.&rdquo; Note the word ever. This means he's
been trying to do something about it for a long time, which would
only make sense; whatever else anybody calls him, Jim's still an
old UNIX guy.</p><p>Now we see Microsoft ads promoting &ldquo;five nines&rdquo; (99.999%)
reliability for Windows 2000 Professional. The claim may be
debatable but not the fact that reliability is a concern, as we've
seen Microsoft suggest previously. Why does reliability matter
now?</p><p>I think it's because the bazaar is losing at least some of
its appetite for PCs marketed as consumer electronics. Starting in
2000, more customers began to realize last year's PC was still
fine. So were Office 98, Quicken 7, Photoshop 5.5 and lots of other
software products&mdash;perfectly adequate (if not always perfectly
functional).</p><p>Then, there was the repositioning of the operating system. It
used to be a pretty product. Now it's just infrastructure. For more
and more people, the platform that came to matter was the Net, not
the PC's OS.</p><p>And then there was the undeniable success of the Net's
self-ubiquitizing infrastructure, which owed far more to free and
open-source software development methods (and developers) than to
anything coming from software vendors whose first urge is to lock
in customers. Linux is clearly part of that. There is no way
Microsoft could ignore the success of Linux or the growing
importance of constantly building infrastructure.</p><p>Ubiquitous infrastructural building materials are by nature
commodities. You might be able to make money selling them, but the
margins are elsewhere. Still, as every business comes to depend
increasingly on commoditized infrastructure, including the Net and
Linux, there is a strategic imperative to contribute to that
infrastructure. If you're not involved in building infrastructure,
your know-how falls behind, to say nothing of innovation.</p><p>Microsoft is starting to get a little bit strategic about
this stuff. That's why they worked together with other companies on
the SOAP and XML-RPC protocols. This is a drop in the bucket
compared to what Linux community natives like Red Hat, VA Linux,
Caldera and others have been doing for years. But it's the same
strategy.</p><p>So what's the strategy for Linux companies, which have been
in the business of building commodity infrastructure all along? We
know they can sell high-margin hardware and services. But can they
sell high-margin software?</p><p>Yes. They can do this by keeping the high-margin source code
closed and giving away as much open-source code as they possibly
can. This is what Caldera is doing with Volution. It's what Borland
is doing with Kylix. It's what Turbolinux is doing with
TurboCluster. There is a huge open-source side to each of those
companies' product strategies&mdash;one that involves giving away a lot
of stuff. But Volution, Kylix and TurboCluster are all
closed-source products. None of those companies go out of their way
to point out that fact, but there it is.</p><p>Traditional closed-source companies like IBM, Sun, Borland
and even Microsoft are starting to adopt open-source strategies (of
very different sorts, at very different speeds). Do traditional
open-source companies need to move in a closed-source direction if
they want to sell high-margin products to enterprise customers? So
far, their answer is yes. And they all know the arguments for open
source.</p><p>So, until some company risks selling open-source software to
enterprises at a high margins and succeeds, selling high-margin
enterprise software will remain a closed-source business, even for
vendors rooted in the Open Source community.</p></div></div>
