    Especially useful for multiboot, partitioned systems, GRUB offers
    flexibility and convenience for startup.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e07580.0x1eff608"></a></h2></div></div><p>GRUB: it's neither larva, fast food nor
the loveliest of acronyms in the GNU herd of free software. Rather,
GRUB is the GNU GRand Unified Bootloader. And, it is truly the
greatest loader for booting Linux and practically any other
OS&mdash;open source or otherwise&mdash;you may have scattered on your
platters.
</p><p>GRUB is independent of any particular operating system and
may be thought of as a tiny, function-specific OS. The purpose of
the GRUB kernel is to recognize filesystems and load boot images,
and it provides both menu-driven and command-line interfaces to
perform these functions. The command-line interface in particular
is quite flexible and powerful, with command history and completion
features familiar to users of the bash shell.</p><p>GRUB is in its element with the multiboot, multidisk systems
typical of Linux and open-source adventurers who may simultaneously
test or track several Linux distributions, the BSDs, GNU/Hurd, BeOS
and perhaps that vestigial partition for Mr. Bill. Even if you
stick with LILO as your system's primary boot loader, it's smart to
keep a GRUB boot floppy handy as the best and fastest way to get
your system back if you otherwise cream your master boot record
(MBR). If you have done any number of multiboot installations, you
know exactly what I'm talking about. Should you need any more
reasons for considering GRUB, check out the sidebar, &ldquo;Why GRUB&rdquo;.
Let's get started!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e07580.0x1eff7c0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Installation of GRUB is a two-step process. The first step is
to install or build GRUB in a host OS environment, and for this we
will, of course, use Linux. The second step is to install and
configure GRUB as the boot loader for your system.</p><p>The first step is the usual: download the source archive,
untar it, configure and make install. Assuming you have found a
source mirror (see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.html" target="_self">www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.html</a>)
and downloaded the source distribution into a suitable working
directory, continue with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf grub-0.5.96.1.tar.gz
cd grub-0.5.96.1
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>This should create the executables:
<span   class="bold"><b>grub</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>grub-install</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>mbchk</b></span>; install support files in
/usr/local/share/grub/i386-pc/, and install the GNU information
manual and man pages.
</p><p>For the second step of installation, we will first build and
work with a GRUB boot floppy. This way we can use GRUB to learn
about its features while testing various configurations for our
particular system. After getting comfortable with the GRUB setup on
floppy, we will then install it onto the MBR of the system's first
hard disk. Even if you decide not to install GRUB on your hard disk
right away, no harm done: you will now have your own GRUB boot
floppy available to rescue systems with trashed boot
loaders.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e07580.0x1effb88"></a>Preparing a GRUB floppy</h2></div></div><p>GRUB recognizes a number of different filesytem types,
including Linux ext2fs, Reiser, MINIX, BSD's ffs, as well as FAT,
so it is possible to make a GRUB boot floppy with any of these
filesystems. We will stick to FAT for this example, however,
because it is the lowest common denominator, and most OSes have
tools for mounting and reading/writing files on FAT floppies. That
way, we will always be able to get to its menu configuration file
if we need to.</p><p>Scrounge around in your junk drawer for some unused floppy (a
new one would be even better), and give it a fresh format and FAT
filesystem:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
fdformat /dev/fd0
mkfs -t msdos /dev/fd0
</pre><p>We are going to put some files on this disk, so go ahead and
mount to your usual floppy mount point (here I use /floppy):
<pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /floppy
</pre>


Now install the directories and files GRUB will need:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p /floppy/boot/grub
cp /usr/local/share/grub/i386-pc/stage* /floppy/boot/grub
</pre>


The floppy can then be unmounted, <b  >umount
/floppy</b>, but leave it in the drive. The GRUB floppy is
prepared and ready for the final installation, which is to install
the GRUB boot loader in the MBR of the floppy itself. For that, we
will use the grub executable we have built with our Linux
installation. Start the executable at the Linux command prompt:
<b  >grub</b>.
</p><p>This brings up an emulator of GRUB's command shell
environment, which looks like Figure 1. We will discuss the
features of this shell in more detail a little further on. For now,
enter the following series of commands at the grub prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grub&gt; root (fd0)
grub&gt; setup (fd0)
grub&gt; quit
</pre><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4622f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. GRUB in command-line mode. Note the on-line help (here
the GRUB emulator is running under Linux in an xterm window).
</p></div></div><p>And that's it! This sequence of commands completes the
installation of GRUB on the floppy disk. It is now bootable and
will allow us to boot any other OS on our system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e07580.0x1f001b8"></a>Demonstrating GRUB</h2></div></div><p>To see how GRUB may be used to boot a multitude of different
operating systems, consider this example setup:</p><p>First Hard Disk (SCSI, Linux /dev/sda): 1st primary
partition: Win982nd primary partition: Linux-Slackware3rd primary
partition: Linux-Debian4th primary partition: Linux SwapSecond Hard
Disk (SCSI, Linux /dev/sdb)1st primary partition: FreeBSD2nd
primary partition: OpenBSD3rd primary partition: BeOS</p><p>Note that although GRUB and Linux are capable of dealing with
installations in extended partitions, here we show a preference for
using primary partitions whenever possible. Filesystems in primary
partitions are often mountable by other operating systems, whereas
cross-OS mounting filesystems in extended partitions is often not
supported.</p><p>This system has two hard disks with six different operating
systems using seven partitions. As you probably know, each OS has
its own nomenclature for naming devices and partitions. For
example, the Slackware installation would be known to Linux as
/dev/sda2 (with swap on /dev/sda4), while FreeBSD would recognize
its filesystem on /dev/da1s1a. Alternatively, if the system were
configured with IDE hard disks, Slackware would be on /dev/hda2,
and FreeBSD would refer to its root directory on /dev/ad1s1a. You
get large helpings of this alphabet soup whenever maintaining any
multiboot setup.</p><p>Since GRUB also needs to be capable of loading any of these
systems, it has its own OS-neutral naming conventions for referring
to devices. Hard disks are all hd, floppy disks are fd, device
numbering starts from zero, partition numbering starts from zero
and complete device names are enclosed in parentheses.</p><p>With these naming rules, the floppy disk is (fd0), the Win98
partition is (hd0,0), and GRUB recognizes the Slackware and Debian
partitions respectively as (hd0,1) for slackware and (hd0,2) for
debian.</p><p>The BSDs further subdivide their own partitions (or
&ldquo;slices&rdquo; in BSD terms), and GRUB would refer to the root mount
for the FreeBSD system on (hd1,0,a).</p><p>Okay, ready to give GRUB a taste? Slide the GRUB floppy in
the drive and reboot your system (with your system's BIOS
configured to boot from A: drive). You should see GRUB's terse boot
messages and then find yourself in the GRUB command-line
environment as shown in Figure 1.</p><p>To start, let's boot Slackware. Enter the following commands
at the grub prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grub&gt; root (hd0,1)
grub&gt; kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2 ro vga=791
grub&gt; boot
</pre><p>Badda-bing, badda-boom, that postage-stamp-sized Tux appears
in the upper-left corner of your screen (yes, Slackware is
configured to use the framebuffer device), and Linux bootstraps its
jolly way into glorious being.
</p><p>Another example. Reboot the system again with the GRUB
floppy, and enter the following commands at the grub prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grub&gt; rootnoverify (hd0,0)
grub&gt; makeactive
grub&gt; chainloader +1
grub&gt; boot
</pre><p>Now your screen turns into a vague blue cloud, and you think
you have made some horrible mistake. Then you realize it's only
Windows and you remind yourself to expunge this partition one day
soon.
</p><p>Let's take a closer look at these examples. In the Slackware
boot, we first used the GRUB <span   class="bold"><b>root</b></span>
command to specify the device for GRUB to access. If the device has
a filesystem recognized by GRUB (that is, one of ext2fs, reiser,
ffs, etc.), it attempts to mount it and get its partition
information, then reports its success following the command. Thus,
you would see the following command/response dialog on your
screen:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grub&gt; root (hd0,1)
Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83
</pre><p>Next, we used the GRUB
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel</b></span> command to specify the boot
image for GRUB to load. The argument to the kernel command is the
filename of the boot image relative to the device specified by the
root command above. The kernel image file can also be specified in
explicit (device)/filename terms as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
grub&gt; kernel (hd0,1)/vmlinuz
</pre>


The kernel command gives you great flexibility for specifying the
boot image you wish to load. For example, if we saved a previous
version of a kernel to the file /vmlinuz.old, we could specify it
with this command (which shows GRUB's response):
<pre     class="programlisting">
grub&gt; kernel /vmlinuz.old root=/dev/sda2 ro vga=ask
[Linux-bzImage, setup=0xe00, size=0xfad30]
</pre>


The arguments following the name of the boot image are passed to
the target kernel and aren't related to GRUB. For Linux, these
kernel arguments are pretty much what you would specify them to be
in lilo.conf. In our example, we tell the kernel what device to
mount for the root partition (root=/dev/sda2 ro), using the device
nomenclature expected by Linux. Note here that we also use the
<span   class="bold"><b>ro</b></span> flag to mount the root
filesystem read-only initially while it performs its filesystem
check. The other kernel argument in our example simply demonstrates
setting another kernel variable (vga=791) to use a particular vga
mode for the framebuffer display.
</p><p>Finally, the last command is <b  >grub&gt;
boot</b>. The kernel image specified is now loaded and sent
rolling down the royal road to bootdom.</p><p>The second example, using Win98, demonstrates the use of
GRUB's chain-loading mechanism. This method of booting loads the
target OS's own boot-chain-loader rather than a kernel image of the
OS. In this instance, we specified:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grub&gt; rootnoverify (hd0,0)
grub&gt; chainloader +1
</pre><p>First, the <span   class="bold"><b>rootnoverify</b></span>
command is for OS filesystems not specifically recognized by GRUB,
so that GRUB will not try to mount the partition. Next, the
chainloader command will use the first sector of the partition of
device (hd0,0) and attempt to boot whatever it finds there. This is
a common means of booting OSes that install their own boot loaders
in the first sector of the partition where they are installed (this
is sometimes called the partition boot sector or PBR).
</p><p>Finally, the <span   class="bold"><b>makeactive</b></span>
command sets the active flag in the partition table for the device
specified by the root command, as some operating systems, like
Win98, require.</p><p>The GRUB command line is easy and fun, and you should boot
the different OSes on your system a few times to get the hang of
it. While you are testing, be sure to keep any notes specific to
getting your particular kernels successfully loaded. This
information will be useful later when you configure the menu system
of GRUB to perform these command-line steps automatically.</p><p>But before we leave the command line, here are a few more
GRUB commands to look at.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>help</b></span> command will
display a list of the 40 or so commands available in GRUB. Typing
the name a particular command after help will produce on-line help
for that particular command. So <b  >grub&gt; help
kernel</b> will tell you all about using the kernel
command.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> command can be used
to view the contents of a file. For example, <b  >grub&gt; cat
(hd0,2)/etc/fstab</b> will show the contents of the
/etc/fstab file in the Debian installation. This is a very handy
way of pulling out system configuration information if your normal
boot loader gets whacked. Note also as you are using the GRUB
command line that, like bash, up and down arrows will scroll
through command history, and a tab will complete the name of a GRUB
command or filename.</p><p>Finally, you can call up a specific menu interface with the
<span   class="bold"><b>configfile</b></span> command as in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grub&gt; configfile (fd0)/boot/grub/menu.lst
</pre><p>This will switch GRUB into its menu mode with an interface
defined by the file, menu.lst. We haven't created that file yet,
but&mdash;look out, segue coming!&mdash;that's exactly what we will do next.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e07580.0x22f9328"></a>Menu Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Using the GRUB command line is cool, but after a few thousand
system starts, you will probably get a little tired of entering the
same commands at the GRUB prompt and long for something a little
more automated. Good news from the GRUB gang: you get a fully
configurable menu interface at no extra charge! The GRUB boot menu
gives you point-and-shoot boot selection, unattended default boot
after a configurable timeout, any number of fallback boots if
previous boots fail, toggle between command-line and menu modes,
and interactive editing of menu selections and password protection.
These features give GRUB an ease of use to match its tremendous
functionality.</p><p>When GRUB boots, it automatically looks for the
/boot/grub/menu.lst file on its boot device (the last three letters
are &ldquo;ELL ess tee&rdquo; and not &ldquo;one ess tee&rdquo;). If the file is found,
GRUB automatically enters its menu mode and presents the user with
a stunning interface, as shown in Figure 2.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4622f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. GRUB's Boot Menu Interface
</p></div></div><p>Listing 1 [found at
<a href="../listings/085/" target="_self"><i  >LJ</i>'s
web site</a>] shows the configuration file responsible for this
demonstration menu. As you can see, it is a simple text file
typical of many UNIX configuration files, where lines starting with
hashes (#) and blank lines are ignored.</p><p>The first set of commands sets general configuration
variables. The <span   class="bold"><b>timeout</b></span> command
sets the time in seconds to wait for the user to make a selection
before proceeding automatically to the
<span   class="bold"><b>default</b></span> boot. The default command
sets which of the following boot stanzas GRUB should attempt to
boot automatically. Boot stanzas are numbered implicitly, starting
from zero, according to their order of appearance in the
configuration file. This order is also how they will be listed in
the menu.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>fallback</b></span> command
specifies which of the boot stanzas to load if the default should
fail. It is possible to set more than one fallback, as is shown in
the example.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>color</b></span> command lets you
breathe a bit of life into the text-mode menu screen. The syntax
for the color command is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
color  foreground/background  [ hilite-fg/hilite-bg ]
</pre><p>where each of the foreground/background colors is specified
with a name from the set of black, blue, green, cyan, red, magenta,
brown and light-gray; dark-gray, light-blue, light-green,
light-cyan, light-cyan, light-red, light-magenta, yellow and white.
Among these colors, only the first eight are used for the
background. The optional highlight color pair, if specified, will
be used to show the current menu selection. When not specified,
GRUB will use the inverse of the normal colors.
</p><p>The rest of the configuration file consists of the boot
stanzas for our demonstration system. The title command marks the
beginning of a new boot stanza, and its argument is the label that
will be displayed for its entry in the menu, from the first
non-white-space character to the end of the line. The remaining
commands in each stanza are identical to those used when working
from the GRUB command line. The exception here is that we no longer
need to give a boot command; GRUB does this job without
asking.</p><p>This example configuration gives only a sample of the many
flexible uses of the GRUB boot loader. Besides multiple OSes, you
can use GRUB to set up menu selections for test kernels, rescue
kernels, different kernel options and so on.</p><p>All in all, the GRUB configuration file will be very similar
to your /etc/lilo.conf. And after working with the GRUB command
line and these examples, it should be a simple matter of firing up
your favorite text editor and creating a menu configuration file
suitable for your own system and preferences. Don't worry if it's
not perfect the first time; you will see that you can make changes
interactively, and the GRUB command line is always available as a
fallback.</p><p>Once you've got your configuration file, mount your GRUB
floppy again, and copy the file (say it has been saved as
mygrub.conf) into the magic location:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp  mygrub.conf /floppy/boot/grub/menu.lst
</pre><p>Now when you boot with your GRUB floppy&mdash;presto!&mdash;you will be
greeted with a lovely boot menu like the one in Figure 2. If you
like, just stare at it for the few seconds it needs to count down
from the timeout setting, and then it will automatically boot into
your default OS. Or, use the arrow keys to highlight the OS you
want to load and press return. Or, type <b  >c</b> to go
to the now-familiar GRUB command prompt. From the command prompt,
press ESC to go back to the boot menu again.
</p><p>It is also possible to edit the entries displayed in the
menu. Typing <b  >e</b> will open a simple vi-like editor
interface for the highlighted entry. This allows you to adjust or
add any settings to the configuration before booting. Any changes
made here will then remain in effect for the duration of the GRUB
session. To make permanent changes, you will later need to edit the
configuration file on the boot disk, saving the changes with your
text editor.</p><p>Play with your GRUB floppy configuration until you have it
set up the way you like. After just a few system boots, you'll be
slinging through GRUB like hashbrowns in a diner.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e07580.0x22f9dd0"></a>Hard Disk Installation</h2></div></div><p>By this time you may be thinking, &ldquo;Okay, GRUB has got it
goin' on. But do I have to keep booting from this lame floppy all
the time?&rdquo; Of course not. Booting from floppy is for
weenies.</p><p>The operation for installing GRUB on the master boot record
of your hard disk is similar to the creation of a GRUB floppy. The
one difference is that our floppy has all the resources GRUB needs
in one place. That is, the boot image, support and configuration
files are all on the floppy device MBR and /boot/grub/ directory.
In a hard disk setup, you can choose where you want these resources
to be.</p><p>For example, you could set up a /boot/grub directory on the
first partition of your first hard disk and copy all GRUB's files
into it as we did in our floppy setup. In our demonstration system,
this would be the Win98 partition, and you may choose to do it that
way if you want. But you can also set up the /boot/grub directory
up in any device/partition on your machine with a filesystem
supported by GRUB. In practice it is usually best to install this
support directory in your most frequently used and/or most stable
partition; that is, one that you aren't reinstalling all the
time.</p><p>For this example, we will use the Slackware partition since
this stays pretty stable, and I tend to do more tracking and
installations in the Debian system. Once this decision is made,
everything else is simple. First, boot into Slackware, create the
/boot/grub directory and copy GRUB's files into it (these are all
the files that the GRUB build installed in the
/usr/local/share/grub/i386-pc directory). Make sure to put your
handcrafted menu.lst configuration file in here, too.</p><p>Next, start GRUB, either with the grub executable you built
in Linux or by rebooting with the GRUB floppy. If GRUB starts in
menu mode, press <b  >c</b> to go to command-line mode.
Enter the following commands at the grub prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
grub&gt; root (hd0,1)
grub&gt; setup (hd0)
grub&gt; quit
</pre><p>You're done. Your system is now fully GRUB'd, installed in
the MBR of your hard disk. Type <b  >reboot</b> as root
(or take the floppy out and jab the keyboard with the old
three-prong) and watch just how fast GRUB comes up now!
</p><p>A few words of explanation about these installation commands.
The first, root (hd0,1), tells GRUB to mount this device, in this
case the partition with the Slackware installation. All files will
now be relative to this device, so the GRUB installer will know to
look for its support files in the /boot/grub directory we created
in the Slackware partition.</p><p>The second command, setup (hd0), is a simplified front end to
GRUB's install command. Note in particular that we specify the
device as (hd0) and not (hd0,0). Device (hd0) results in GRUB's
installation to the master boot record, which is what we want. If
we had instead used (hd0,0), GRUB would be installed to the boot
sector of the first partition, rather than the MBR. The difference
is crucial; your technical writer makes mistakes like this so you
don't have to. While each partition can have a boot sector, your
hard disk will have only one master boot record the BIOS loads
every time you start your machine. Unless you are doing some kind
of funky boot-chaining, like using LILO to boot GRUB, you will
usually want to install GRUB in the master boot record.</p><p>When GRUB installs itself on a device, it first copies a
small piece of itself to the MBR, which it calls stage1. Then it
follows stage1 with just enough information about where to find the
rest of GRUB. In our example, GRUB will put stage1 in the MBR,
followed by a blocklist that points to the Slackware partition.
GRUB will then find the rest of what it needs (its stage2 files) in
the /boot/grub directory.</p><p>To check this setup, just edit the menu configuration file in
Slackware's /boot/grub/menu.lst at any time. Any changes will be
reflected in the next boot.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e07580.0x22fa2f8"></a>Error Recovery</h2></div></div><p>If you should foul up the hard disk installation somehow or
want to uninstall GRUB from your system, here's what you need to
know.</p><p>First, if you ever want to clean your MBR from whatever is
installed there, the canonical method is to use the
<span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> program from an MS-DOS boot
floppy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
A:&gt; FDISK /MBR
</pre><p>Of course, this isn't necessary if you just want to go back
to LILO as your system's boot manager. In that case, simply make
sure your /etc/lilo.conf file has a line that reads
<b  >boot=/dev/hda</b>. Then, when the rest of the
lilo.conf file is the way you want, just rerun LILO. This will put
LILO back on the MBR of your system.
</p><p>If you install GRUB in the boot sector of a partition,
instead of the MBR (such as specifying setup (hd0,0) instead of
setup (hd0)), you may need to reinstall that OS's boot loader. In
the case of DOS/Windows, this means running the
<span   class="bold"><b>sys</b></span> command from your DOS/Windows
boot floppy: <b  >A:&gt; SYS C:</b>.</p><p>If, this is a Linux partition, it is again effective to rerun
LILO, where /etc/lilo.conf has a line in the boot stanza that reads
<b  >root=/dev/hda1</b>.</p><p>In general, most OSes will have a way to reinstall their
partition's boot sector without doing a full reinstallation from
scratch. (For FreeBSD, see boot0cfg(8); for OpenBSD, see
installboot(8).)</p><p>In practice, especially if you followed through on the GRUB
floppy examples, you should find that GRUB itself is one of the
best rescue and system recovery tools in your toolkit. For example,
if you have ever made a screwup in your lilo.conf file, you know
you can be in for some major pain if your system won't boot. With
GRUB, you always have a miniature, self-contained operating system
that can recognize and mount different filesystems, find files,
locate kernels and boot them, bringing your system back to life so
you can work on it. At times like these, GRUB can save your
bacon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e07580.0x22fa820"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>As is typical of GNU software, GRUB is rich with capabilities
beyond what are described here. Some of these include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Remapping disks and partition hiding, so you can
even run multiple versions of DOS/Windows, on other than the first
hard disk.</p></li><li><p>Network booting with BOOTP and DHCP protocols, to
support multiboot schemes across a network and diskless
operation.</p></li><li><p>Keyboard remapping, disk geometry access, memory
reading, I/O port and processor probes, password protection,
decompression support, etc.</p></li></ul></div><p>See the GNU information manual for more information on these
topics. GRUB is under active development, and even more features
are planned for future releases.
</p><p>In this brave GNU world, with vast acreage of cheap hard disk
and a glut of great free OSes available, you really need a flexible
and user-friendly boot loader to manage them all. Grab GRUB and
give it a go.</p><p><a href="4622s1.html" target="_self">Why GRUB?</a></p></div></div>
