    The Apache Toolbox simplifies installation and configuration of
    the Apache web server and related modules.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1291580.0x1389660"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Apache web server is one of the most
common applications run on Linux systems. Although it comes with
most distributions there will be times when you want to run the
latest version along with all of its modules. Getting all the
source code and then configuring, compiling and installing each
piece by hand can be a daunting task. The Apache Toolbox provides
an easier way to do all of this.
</p><p>The Apache Toolbox, written by Bryan Andrews, provides a
convenient front end for configuring and compiling Apache, as well
as obtaining any needed source code. In addition to the modules
included with Apache, the Toolbox can also configure and compile
programs such as PHP and MySQL (See Table 1 for a complete list of
software). It also compiles and installs the latest gd libraries
for the creation of JPEG and PNG files.</p><p><a href="4596s2.html" target="_self">Table 1. Modules Supported by the
Apache Toolbox</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1291580.0x1389870"></a>Obtaining and Installing the Apache
Toolbox</h2></div></div><p>The Apache Toolbox comes in two forms: a large (approximately
12MB) file and a small file. The large file contains the Toolbox
script along with source code for Apache and most of the modules;
the small file contains only the Apache Toolbox script. Since the
Apache Toolbox tries to download any missing source code, it makes
sense to use the smaller file if you have a recent Linux
distribution or a fast internet connection.</p><p>If you download the large Apache Toolbox tarball it will
untar into a directory called www-src. This directory contains
zipped tarballs of the source code for Apache and all the modules.
The Apache Toolbox script, called install.sh, is also in this
directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1291580.0x13899d0"></a>Running the Apache Toolbox</h2></div></div><p>To start the Apache Toolbox, switch to root and run the
install.sh script. This presents a menu of programs and modules
that can be selected (see Figure 1). A selection is made by typing
the number or letter next to an item. The program performs sanity
checks, depending upon your selection. It ensures, for example,
that Python is installed on the system when the mod_python module
is selected. The program also displays descriptions of the modules
when &ldquo;99&rdquo; is entered. There are two pages of modules, and the 99
command only displays descriptions for the current page.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4596f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Apache Toolbox's Configure Script Menu
</p></div></div><p>Once you have made all of your selections, type
<b  >go</b> to start the build process. The first thing
that the Toolbox does is warn you about any installed RPMs that
conflict with the software it will install. You are given the
option to continue the compilation process or to quit to remove the
offending packages. If you quit to remove the offending RPMs, the
Apache Toolbox remembers your settings when you restart it.</p><p>The Apache Toolbox uses <span   class="bold"><b>wget</b></span>
to download any packages that it needs. If wget isn't installed on
your machine, the Toolbox can download it, using Lynx, and install
it for you. The FTP locations for all the modules are hard-coded in
the install.sh script so you can verify them to ensure that you're
getting legitimate files.</p><p>After the wget checks are performed, you are asked if you
want to change Apache's default installation path. Following this
question, the Apache tarball is uncompressed. If the program finds
existing Apache source code in the www-src directory, you are given
the option to back it up. Next, Apache is preconfigured based upon
the selections that you have made.</p><p>Once that is done the selected modules are untarred, built
and installed. If the script can't locate source code for a module,
you are asked if it should be downloaded. The Apache Toolbox uses
the installwatch library to log the results of the compile and the
install process for each module to the logs directory.</p><p>If you have elected to install PHP, you are given the option
of editing its configuration script. You can use the editor of your
choice to edit the file, and the PHP build process continues when
you are done.</p><p>Once all the modules have been compiled, you are given the
option to modify the Apache configuration script. After that the
Toolbox tailors the Apache Makefile for your module selections.
Then you have to compile and install Apache by changing to the
Apache source directory and typing <b  >make</b>. If
Apache compiles without error, then type <b  >make
install</b> to install it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1291580.0x138a000"></a>Caveats</h2></div></div><p>Because the Apache Toolbox uses the latest versions of
Apache, PHP, etc., it is important to have a fairly recent Linux
distribution. The first machine I attempted to use the Apache
Toolbox on was an older one running SuSE 6.1 and the installwatch
library and PHP wouldn't compile on it. I moved to a machine
running Red Hat 6.2, and everything compiled without
incident.</p><p>I had originally downloaded the large Apache Toolbox tarball
complete with source code. When a newer version came out I just
downloaded the small Apache Toolbox file and put the newer
install.sh script in my existing www-src directory. Even though the
newer script was supposed to use an updated version of PHP, it kept
using the one installed by the older Apache Toolbox. Once I deleted
the configuration file (config.cache) created by the earlier
version of the Apache Toolbox the newer version of PHP was
used.</p><p>While the Apache Toolbox automates the configure, compile and
install process, you might have to do a few things by hand.
Examples of this include modifying your configuration files to
start Apache or changing the default MySQL password.</p><p>The Apache Toolbox menu and description pages are a few lines
longer than what fits on a normal display, so you might have to
scroll a bit to read everything. I also noticed that descriptions
for some of the modules, such as mod_auth_radius and mod_auth_POP3,
were missing from the descriptions page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1291580.0x138a210"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The Apache Toolbox automates the process of obtaining and
compiling Apache and Apache modules. It verifies that your system
has the prerequisites for running modules and warns about installed
RPMs that conflict with the software that it is installing. Its
simple menu interface makes it easy to configure Apache to use a
wide variety of modules in different combinations. While it doesn't
automate the entire process, it does take care of the most tedious
tasks.</p><p><a href="4596s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
