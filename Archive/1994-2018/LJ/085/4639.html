    This month Reuven discusses JSPs, which allow programmers and
    nonprogrammers alike to create servlets and dynamic pages with a mix of
    Java and HTML.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd47580.0xe3f660"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we took a first look at
server-side Java, sticking our toes into the water by writing some
servlets. Servlets are Java programs that produce dynamic web
content. CGI programs are executable programs external to the web
server that execute from scratch each time they are invoked. By
contrast, Java servlets live inside a servlet container, a Java
virtual machine (JVM), that is closely connected to an HTTP server.
Whenever the web server needs dynamic content, it makes a request
from the servlet container.
</p><p>In many ways, writing a Java servlet is like writing a
mod_perl handler: it gives you a great deal of power, but also
requires a fair amount of discipline. It can also be frustrating to
write a servlet that is 90% static HTML and 10% Java, and the
number of times that you invoke out.println() can become
maddening.</p><p>An increasingly popular solution to this problem is
JavaServer Pages or JSP. JSP is similar in spirit to Microsoft's
ASP, as well as to the open-source PHP language and Mason component
system. JSP allows you to mix Java with HTML in a number of
different ways. The fact that JSPs, like most Java programs, are
remarkably platform-independent, means you can write JSPs on a
Windows box, run them on a development Linux server and then deploy
them on Solaris.</p><p>This month, we will take a quick look at JSPs, which are a
good way to get to learn Java as well as an easy way for Java
programmers to create servlets without having to work too
hard.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd47580.0xe3f870"></a>How JSPs Work</h2></div></div><p>The idea behind JSPs is remarkably simple: they are servlets
in disguise. When a JSP is first invoked, it is automatically
turned into a servlet. This servlet is then complied into a Java
.class file, which is then executed inside of the servlet
container. The first time a JSP is invoked, it will take a little
bit longer to return data to the user, due to all the action taking
place behind the scenes.</p><p>In a JSP, everything is assumed to be static content unless
it is placed inside special braces, &lt;% and %&gt;. These tags are
known as &ldquo;scriptlets&rdquo; in JSP lingo. The following HTML file
(which we will name main.jsp) is also a perfectly legitimate
JSP:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
   &lt;Head&gt;
      &lt;Title&gt;Static JSP Title&lt;/Title&gt;
   &lt;/Head&gt;
   &lt;Body&gt;
      &lt;P&gt;Static JSP Content&lt;/P&gt;
   &lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>The above JSP is rather boring in that it consists
exclusively of static content. But the JSP engine doesn't care how
many pieces of dynamic content a JSP contains; it will turn the
entire thing into a servlet regardless of its complexity. In the
case of the above JSP, the resulting servlet will be little more
than a long string of out.println() statements inside of the
doGet() method.
</p><p>On my system, I saved the above HTML into main.jsp in the
examples directory that comes with Tomcat
/usr/java/jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1/webapps/examples/jsp/. This is
admittedly not the best place to install it, but it is the
easiest.</p><p>Once I've installed the JSP, I don't need to do anything
else; the system will automatically translate it into a servlet
source (.java) file, and then compile it into a Java .class
file.</p><p>We can execute and view our JSP via the Tomcat server, which
operates by default on port 8080,
http://localhost:8080/examples/jsp/main.jsp/.</p><p>If you've configured Apache and mod_jk to forward servlet and
JSP queries to Tomcat, then you should also be able to view
main.jsp with this URL:
http://localhost/examples/jsp/main.jsp/.</p><p>On my system, the .java and .class files generated by the JSP
system for main.jsp are in the directory:
/usr/java/jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1/work/localhost_8080%2Fexamples. If I
list the contents of this directory, I see the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
_0002fjsp_0002fmain_0002ejspmain.class
_0002fjsp_0002fmain_0002ejspmain_jsp_0.java
_0002fjsp_0002fmain_0002ejspmain_jsp_1.java
_0002fjsp_0002fmain_0002ejspmain_jsp_2.java
_0002fjsp_0002fmain_0002ejspmain_jsp_3.java
_0002fjsp_0002fmain_0002ejspmain_jsp_4.java
_0002fjsp_0002fmain_0002ejspmain_jsp_5.java
_0002fjsp_0002fmain_0002ejspmain_jsp_6.java
</pre><p>As you can see, there are seven different .java files, each
corresponding to a different version of the original JSP. Each time
I modify the JSP, the system must create a new .java file. The
Tomcat default keeps previous versions of the JSP-based servlet
around; however, there can only be one .class file at a given time,
which is clearly the case in this directory.
</p><p>The names of the .java and .class files are quite long and
aren't meant to be entered directly into a web browser. Part of the
magic of JSPs is that Tomcat can find the servlet associated with a
given URL intelligently and automatically, creating the Java source
file as necessary.</p><p>You should take a look at the Java source code created by the
JSP translator so that you can get a feel for the hard work being
done behind the scenes. Our simple, static JSP has been turned into
a servlet that takes up more than 100 lines of Java source code. In
case we ever have to debug our JSPs from the translated servlet
source code&mdash;a difficult task, as anyone who has used Perl's
HTML::Mason can attest&mdash;the servlet includes comments that provide
a basic mapping from the line numbers in the original JSP to those
in the resulting servlet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd47580.0xe3fd98"></a>Dynamic Content</h2></div></div><p>We can jazz things up a bit by adding one of the special JSP
tags to main.jsp. The first tag inserts the results of some Java
code into the output sent to the user:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
   &lt;Head&gt;
      &lt;Title&gt;Mini-dynamic JSP Title&lt;/Title&gt;
   &lt;/Head&gt;
   &lt;Body&gt;
      &lt;P&gt;You are connecting from
         &lt;%= request.getRemoteHost() %&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
   &lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>The expression inside of &lt;%= %&gt; is invoked, and its
return value is placed in the output stream. Because a JSP is a
servlet in disguise, it has access to the objects normally
available to a servlet, such as &ldquo;request&rdquo; and &ldquo;response&rdquo;.
Notice how the Java within &lt;%= %&gt; does not end with a
semicolon; I can tell you from personal experience that it's
difficult to break the habit of inserting semicolons there, but
your JSPs will die if you insist on them.
</p><p>To perform one or more Java computations without having the
results sent to the user's browser, use the basic &lt;% %&gt; tags.
These tags can be interspersed with HTML, making it possible to
have conditional text appear in the response (see Listing
1).</p><p><a href="4639l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Using &lt;% %&gt;
Tags</a></p><p>If the hostname of the user's computer is available, we print
its name. Otherwise, we print the host's IP address. Notice how the
if/then/else block is interspersed with the static HTML. The
request.getRemoteAddr() call is invoked only if
request.getRemoteHost() returns an empty string (&ldquo;&rdquo;).</p><p>A number of JSP directives are invoked with the &lt;%@ %&gt;
tags. All of these directives take effect at the time of
JSP-to-servlet translation. A directive keyword is placed
immediately after the @ symbol, followed by zero or more
attributes.</p><p>For example, let's assume we have a standard sitewide menu
bar in a JSP named menubar.jsp:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="one"&gt;Option 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="two"&gt;Option 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre><p>We can incorporate that into our document using the
&ldquo;include&rdquo; directive (see Listing 2).
</p><p><a href="4639l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Using the &ldquo;Include&rdquo;
Directive</a></p><p>It's important to remember that directives take effect when
the JSP is turned into a servlet, not at runtime. Thus, the above
example will work fine until you change menubar.jsp. Since the
contents of menubar.jsp were incorporated into main.jsp just before
the latter was turned into a servlet, the &lt;%@ include %&gt; tag
no longer exists and, therefore, will not update things in the way
we might expect. The solution is to use a runtime JSP action,
described below.</p><p>There are two additional special JSP tags. One of them,
&lt;%-- --%&gt;, acts as a comment. While it might seem odd to use
a JSP comment when HTML comments already exist, the difference is
important to remember: JSP comments are removed by the JSP engine
when the servlet is created. By contrast, HTML comments are passed
through untouched and are visible to any end user who selects the
&ldquo;view source&rdquo; option on their browser. Given the choice, I tend
to put most comments inside of the JSP comment tags, except for
those that will help me to debug the JSP's output using the
resulting HTML source code.</p><p>The final JSP tag, &lt;%! %&gt;, allows you to declare
instance variables (also known as fields) for the JSP's resulting
servlet. While it might seem tempting to use declaration tags to
declare variables you will use in the rest of the JSP, remember
that using fields means you must deal with thread safety. Given the
headaches associated with threads, it's probably a good idea to
avoid them if you can. You can also use the declaration tag to
define new methods local to your JSP, although I'm not convinced
this is such a good idea.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd47580.0xe403c8"></a>JSP Actions</h2></div></div><p>Directives are useful if we want to affect the way in which
the servlet is built. But what if we want to affect the servlet's
actions at runtime?</p><p>We could, of course, include Java code to perform these
actions. But JSP includes a number of special tags that are
translated into Java code in the servlet, allowing you to write
code without having to know any Java.</p><p>JSP action tags are actually XML and are defined in special
XML documents known as tag libraries. So while they might appear to
be HTML, they aren't, which often means you must pay particular
attention to items such as closing tags and slashes.</p><p>The built-in JSP tag library includes a number of functions,
one of which looks suspiciously similar to the include directive we
saw in Listing 2. Listing 3 shows a version of main.html that uses
the &lt;jsp:include&gt; action, rather than the directive, to bring
in menubar.jsp.</p><p><a href="4639l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Using the
&lt;jsp:include&gt; Action</a></p><p>The difference between this version and its predecessor is
subtle but significant: whereas the include directive incorporates
the named page when the JSP is translated into a servlet, the
include action works at runtime. If you were to modify menubar.jsp
between invocations of main.jsp, the directive version would ignore
the new menu bar, while the action version would display the latest
version. Of course, this comes at a cost; the &lt;jsp:include&gt;
action performs a runtime request, making it slower and less
efficient than the directive.</p><p>Because pages requested by &lt;jsp:include&gt; have access to
all of the request information from the top-level JSP, it's
possible to use &lt;jsp:include&gt; to create dynamically changing
menu bars, personalization systems and database access
libraries.</p><p>There are other JSP actions as well. One of them is
&lt;jsp:forward&gt;, which passes the request onto another JSP. As
with &lt;jsp:include&gt;, this takes place within the servlet
engine, meaning HTTP request and user-session information are still
available. For example, Listing 4 shows a version of our JSP that
forwards users to another page if their hostname is not
identifiable.</p><p><a href="4639l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Sample Version of
JSP</a></p><p>If your server does not contain a page named no-reverse.jsp,
then the user will get a 404 (file not found) error in their web
browser. However, their browser will continue to display the URL of
the originally requested page, main.jsp. This is because the JSP
forward is performed internally, without the need for an external
HTTP forward.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd47580.0xe40898"></a>A Simple Web Log JSP</h2></div></div><p>Last month, we wrote some simple servlets that allow us to
create and view a web log, sometimes known as blog. Since JSPs are
translated into servlets, there is no reason why we cannot create a
JSP that accomplishes the same thing as that servlet. It will
obviously look a bit different, but the effect should be the
same.</p><p>Listing 5 contains a JSP (showblog.jsp) that performs the
same task as the ShowBlog servlet from last month. In other words,
this JSP prints the contents of my web log, as stored in a
PostgreSQL database table, sorted from the newest entry to the
oldest.</p><p><a href="4639l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5.
showblog.jsp</a></p><p>I should note right now that showblog.jsp is a terrible
example of how to write JSPs; it is simply meant to demonstrate
what is possible, not what is elegant or best. (We'll discuss such
issues over the next two months, when we discuss JavaBeans and
custom tag libraries.)</p><p>Let's go through this JSP, so that you can see exactly how it
works.</p><p>We begin with two &ldquo;page&rdquo; directives. These directives allow
us to set up the basic configuration for our JSP, beginning with
the MIME ContentType header the page will return, and even permit
us to specify the programming language to be interspersed with the
nonprogrammatic text. While such functionality does not actually
exist, it's theoretically possible to write JSPs that use Perl to
produce XML, or Python to produce PNG images.</p><p>Notice how we can name one or more attributes in our page
directive. The first line of showblog.jsp sets both the language
and the ContentType attributes. The second line indicates that the
resulting servlet should import the packages within java.sql, which
will allow us to connect to our relational database server
(PostgreSQL in this case) using JDBC.</p><p>After a tiny bit of introductory HTML, we drop deep into
Java. We create an SQL connection object and use it to connect to
our PostgreSQL server. We retrieve data from the database, and then
iterate over the ResultSet on a row-by-row basis.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd47580.0xe40c60"></a>Something Is Wrong Here</h2></div></div><p>As I indicated above, this is a terrible way to write JSPs.
Not only will the performance be terrible because of the many
database connections being created and destroyed, but we have
created a horrible mishmash of code and HTML. Indeed, the only
thing we seem to have saved here is a bit of effort writing
out.println() for producing HTML output.</p><p>Moreover, much of the intent behind JSPs is to remove code
from the HTML pages, allowing nonprogrammers to create dynamic
pages with a minimum of effort. If we must insert this much code in
order to create dynamic pages, chances are fairly slim that a
nonprogrammer will want to try their hand at web
development.</p><p>Moreover, our translation of the ShowBlog servlet to a JSP
resulted in the removal of several exception-handling routines. Our
servlet was intelligent enough to handle the disappearance of the
PostgreSQL server and could produce a reasonable error message. Our
JSP, by contrast, produced a backtrace containing error messages.
This backtrace is useful for developers but is neither friendly nor
useful for the end user who will visit our site (in all fairness,
we can set the errorPage attribute in the page directive, such that
errors are forwarded to a different JSP).</p><p>A good solution would remove as much code as possible from
JSPs, allowing nonprogrammers to make use of that code in a
standard way and separating the programmatic and nonprogrammatic
content. And indeed, JSPs come with support for JavaBeans, where
each &ldquo;bean&rdquo; is actually an object with a variety of methods we
can use from within a JSP, using special &lt;jsp: &gt; actions. The
trick to a successful JSP deployment depends on, in no small part,
an intelligent use of JavaBeans. Moreover, JSPs allow us to create
our own tag libraries defining custom actions, so that we can
replace even more code with tags that resemble the assorted
&lt;jsp: &gt; actions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd47580.0xe37700"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>JavaServer Pages, or JSPs, provide a coating of syntactic
sugar around servlets, which can sometimes be difficult for
nonprogrammers to learn. However, this month's most complex example
of a JSP demonstrates that they can easily get out of control,
containing close to as much code as a typical servlet. While it is
easier to work with JSPs overall, the supposed benefits of separate
code from HTML fall by the wayside as the JSPs get more
complex.</p><p>Next month, we will look at JavaBeans, which allow us to push
quite a bit of programming to classes defined and maintained
outside of the JSP. Following that, we will look at JSP's custom
tag libraries, which make it possible to create our own little
languages for use inside of our JSPs.</p><p><a href="4639s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
