them anyway? Well, many organizations, particularly larger ones,
like certification a lot. Why? Because it tells them several
things: first, it tells them the candidate is dedicated enough to
the profession to get certification (with or without training).
Second, it tells them this candidate actually knows something about
what he/she claims to have knowledge of; they don't just have to
take the candidate's word. Frankly, in many larger places, the
folks who do the initial screening don't have a clue about
operating systems or computers, beyond pulling up a word processor
or spreadsheet and using it. This should be obvious from their
blind dogma insisting all correspondence be submitted in Word
format, otherwise they can't figure out how to read it. Do I insist
on certification? No. I actually like someone who has little or no
training/experience so I can teach my way. Take it from someone
who's been there, there are at least three ways to go about any
task in Linux. I happen to like my way. This debate is something
the folks at LPI struggle with, too&mdash;I know I volunteer many hours
working with them. Ensuring that the questions are relevant,
unambiguous and not biased toward any given distribution; that the
correct answers are correct (grammatically and syntactically, as
well as technically); and also that the wrong answers are wrong (or
at least more wrong than the right ones) is a time-consuming
process. So, if you have a little time and even a little knowledge,
you're invited to help devise and submit questions for
consideration&mdash;you don't need to be an expert. While you're at it,
why not take the exams? It won't hurt and might even get you a foot
in a large and otherwise closed door.
</p><p>ipmenu:
<a href="http://users.pandora.be/stes/ipmenu.html" target="_self">users.pandora.be/stes/ipmenu.html</a></p><p>This little utility won't make you an iptables expert, but it
will help you create, view and edit iptables' rules. Based on
correspondence I've had, the most difficult part seems to be the
concept of separate tables for chains, depending on where the rules
in those chains work. The good part is that while it's
curses-based, it's not X-based. After all, X on firewall isn't the
best idea, although I recognize that under some circumstances it
will happen anyway. Requires: cursel, objc, sh.</p><p>manedit:
<a href="http://wolfpack.twu.net/ManEdit" target="_self">http://wolfpack.twu.net/ManEdit/</a></p><p>I don't personally know many folks who can write man pages.
In fact, this is one area where nonprogrammers can help out.
Perhaps you just want to improve grammar, spelling or add some
comments of your own to existing man pages. This utility should
help you do all the above and more in a nice graphical environment.
Requires: libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext,
libX11, libm, glibc.</p><p>chemtool:
<a href="http://www.uni-ulm.de/~s_tvolk/chemtool.html" target="_self">www.uni-ulm.de/~s_tvolk/chemtool.html</a></p><p>I remember in chemistry class we had to draw chemicals to
visualize the bonding. Not sure I really learned anything from it,
but it was required. Well,
<span   class="bold"><b>chemtool</b></span> does all this better than
I ever could. When your creation is done, you can export it to
various formats, including PostScript and Xfig. Some examples and
templates are included to get you started. Requires: libgtk,
libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext, libX11, libm,
glibc.</p><p>Project Clock:
<a href="http://members.optushome.com.au/starters/pclock" target="_self">http://members.optushome.com.au/starters/pclock/</a></p><p>This small, lightweight utility can be used to keep track of
how much time you devote to various projects during the day. It can
be started easily at login, then select the project to add time to
as you go. Projects are simple to add, and an included report
generator will show you what you need to do come billing time.
Requires: tcl/tk, tix.</p><p>gfract:
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/osku/gfract" target="_self">http://www.iki.fi/osku/gfract/</a></p><p>While not incredibly useful, this program is fun. After all,
who doesn't like fractals? This program allows you to view
fractals, cycle colors and other things. Requires: libgtk, libdgk,
libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext, libX11, libm, libpng, libz,
glibc.</p><p>MRTG Remote Data Collector:
<a href="http://pandora.sytes.net/mrdc" target="_self">http://pandora.sytes.net/mrdc/</a></p><p>MRTG does one thing very well: graph bandwidth usage, but it
doesn't track much else. To help,
<span   class="bold"><b>mrdc</b></span> can collect and present other
kinds of data for MRTG to graph. For example,
<span   class="bold"><b>mrdc</b></span> can pass load data so you can
watch a system's load over time. Or, it can graph physical memory
versus virtual (swap) memory or number of running processes to
total processes. Requires: Perl, snmp on the system from which to
collect data and MRTG.</p><p>Input/Output Grapher:
<a href="http://www.dynw.com/iog" target="_self">http://www.dynw.com/iog/</a></p><p>When MRTG is overkill, or you just don't want to configure
anything that simple for a bandwidth monitor, IOG might be what you
need. It uses bar graphs instead of the line graphs used in MRTG
and is easier to set up and run. You will need to know what your
ifInOctets and ifOutOctets device numbers are, but a walk of the
<span   class="bold"><b>snmp</b></span> tree will show that quickly
enough. Requires: Perl, snmp on the system to be monitored.</p><p>OpenRealty:
<a href="http://jonroig.com/freecode/openrealty" target="_self">http://jonroig.com/freecode/openrealty/</a></p><p>If you are a realtor or know any realtors, then this software
will be of interest. It claims to be simple enough for a realtor to
set up, and I imagine that means technoneanderthal realtors. It
requires someone to make adjustments to the index.php page, but
beyond that, this is the simplest package to administer I've seen
in a while. I wish realtors had something like this set up the last
time I was looking for a house in the States. If you're not in the
US, you might need to make some adjustments (including
translations), but it would be a trivial undertaking. Requires: web
server w/ MySQL and PHP4, MySQL, web browser.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
