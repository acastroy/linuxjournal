    Mihai shows how Python can be used to create a CGI script to
    enable elegant searching.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ab580.0x23a35b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Recently, I became the owner of more than
a thousand records of Go (an ancient oriental strategic board game)
games played by professional or amateur players. All the games were
stored in Smart Game Format (SGF), which is a text-based format
designed to keep records of board games for two players. Naturally,
I made them available to other players through my web page.
</p><p>To make searching through the archive easier, I first used an
HTML form with only one text input field. The user could enter a
string (for example, a player name) that was passed to a Python CGI
script which, in turn, invoked good old
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> to find the matching files,
as shown in Figure 1. But this is a crude way of finding
information. For instance, it can be used to find all the games
played by a certain player but not to find more complicated things,
such as all the games that player played with black stones or all
the games won by that player in 1995.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4544f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Old, Crude Searching Method
</p></div></div><p>In order to make a better search engine, I had to use a
different approach. First, the database should describe the
collection of game files. Then, a multiple input field form should
be created to allow the user to search for various pieces of
information at the same time. Finally, there should be a way to set
up communication between the browser and database server, in order
to make the result of the database query available to the user as
an HTML document. Thus, the whole search would be performed as
mapped in Figure 2.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4544f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A More Elegant Search Method
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ab580.0x23a3b30"></a>The Tools</h2></div></div><p>I chose MySQL 3.22.32 as the database and Python 1.5.2 for
CGI scripting. I have played with Perl but prefer the feel of
Python. The installation procedure for these programs has been
explained already in many articles and will not be covered here.
The reader should check the web sites in Resources for further
details concerning installation. Communication between MySQL and
Python is handled by a contributed module, presented below.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ab580.0x23a3c38"></a>MySQLmodule</h2></div></div><p>Python makes MySQL queries through a special module designed
by Joerg Senekowitsch. Of course, several other modules are
available on the Net, but MySQLmodule1.4 was easy to install and
learn, and it worked very well for me. On some systems (like
FreeBSD) it is possible to install this module at the same time as
Python. On my Slackware 7.1 Linux, I had to build and install it as
a dynamically loadable module. This is a three-step procedure:
untar the MySQLmodule archive, compile the shared module and
install the module somewhere in Python's library path.</p><p>Step one is fairly simple. As root, one would type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
myhost:~# tar xvzf MySQLmodule-1.4.tar.gz
</pre><p>A new directory named MySQLmodule-1.4/ will be created with
several files, the most important of which are MySQLmodule.c (the
source for the module to be compiled) and README (a file with
installation and use information).
</p><p>There are several tricky things about step two. For instance,
one must know precisely where the libraries and include files for
MySQL and Python can be found. On my system, MySQL 3.22.32 places
the mysqlclient library in /usr/lib/mysql and the mysql.h include
file in /usr/include/mysql. Python libraries can be found in
/usr/lib/python1.5/config and the include file in
/usr/include/python1.5. The command to compile MySQLmodule
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<b  >myhost</b>:~# gcc -shared -I/usr/include/mysql MySQLmodule.so
</pre><p>Another hint: the order of items in the above command line is
important and must not be changed! Believe me, this is a
hard-learned truth.
</p><p>Step three consists of copying MySQLmodule.so to a directory
where it can be found by Python at runtime. For Python 1.5 this
could be /usr/lib/python1.5/lib-dynload, where other shared object
files also reside. With Python 2.0 (which I also tested) I would
recommend using the directory
/usr/lib/python2.0/site-packages/.</p><p>Once the module is installed, it should be available from
Python. It is a good idea to check this right away with a simple
import statement such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<b  >myhost</b>:~$ python
Python 1.5.2 (#1, May 28 2000, 18:04:10)
Copyright 1991-1995 Stichting Matematisch Centrum,
Amsterdam
&gt;&gt;&gt; import MySQL
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre><p>If Python doesn't complain with an error message, chances are
the MySQL module is properly installed and working.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ab580.0x23a4160"></a>The HTML Form</h2></div></div><p>The user should be able to search the database for several
items like the tournament name, the black and white player names,
the date of the game (at least the year) and also the winner of the
game. All this information is available in the SGF files along with
the actual game record.</p><p>So, I wrote the HTML document shown in Listing 1. Yes, I like
to write HTML by hand, and there is no need for anything more
complicated. Of course, &ldquo;myhost&rdquo; has to be replaced with the
actual hostname of the web server. The reader will also notice the
HTML form acts by calling the CGI script named search.py once the
submit button is clicked. The appearance of the document loaded by
Netscape is shown in Figure 3.</p><p><a href="4544l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Archive

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ab580.0x23a4580"></a>The Igo Database</h2></div></div><p>Each item in the HTML form has to be described in the
database. To this end, I created a new database to store the
tables. This is done as root, by typing:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<b  >myhost</b>:~# mysqladmin create igo
</pre><p>where igo is the new database name. This is not enough
though, because only root will have access to the new database. To
grant only SELECT privileges to all users for the new database,
root has to type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
<b  >myhost</b>:~# mysql mysql
mysql&gt; insert into db values (
'%','igo','','Y','N', 'N', 'N', 'N','N','N', 'N',
     'N', 'N');
</pre>


This changes the table database in the MySQL internal database by
adding an entry for the igo database. Then, the MySQL d&aelig;mon
has to be restarted or the command <b  >mysql&gt; flush
privileges;</b> has to be typed so that the MySQL d&aelig;mon
becomes aware of the privilege change.
</p><p>Now all users should be able to access data in database igo,
but only root can change the data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ab580.0x23a48f0"></a>The MySQL Tables</h2></div></div><p>Creating the tables (one for each tournament) was easy. For
instance, a table named gosei, for the tournament Gosei, was made
with the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<b  >myhost</b>:~# mysql igo
mysql&gt; create table gosei (
        black varchar(30),
        white varchar(30),
        dt date,
        rez varchar(30),
        fname varchar(30),
        ;
Query OK, 0 rows affected, (0.00 sec)
mysql&gt;
</pre><p>The table has five columns: black player's name, white
player's name, the date of the game, the result and finally, the
corresponding SGF file name.
</p><p>Loading the data in the table is another matter. I suppose
one way would be to type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; insert into gosei values ('Cho Chikun', 'Kato Masao', '1987-07-03', 'B+3.5', 'gosei87_1.sgf' );
</pre><p>but I'd rather learn a new programming language than enter
that a thousand times. Fortunately, there is another way of loading
data in a MySQL table&mdash;from a text file. Each row in the file
matches a row in the table, and the fields are separated by white
spaces, as shown in Table 1.
</p><p><a href="4544t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Text to Be Loaded to MySQL
Table</a></p><p>Suppose this file is also named gosei. To pass the data to a
MySQL table, one would write</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; load data infile "gosei" into table gosei;
</pre><p>Then a query result should look like Table 2.
</p><p><a href="4544t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Loading from a Text
File</a></p><p>The reader might ask &ldquo;Okay, but isn't making a huge text
file another burden?&rdquo; Actually, that's an easy task for yet
another small Python script (that I will not show, because it's not
directly related to our topic).</p><p>With the igo database created and the tables loaded with
data, there was only one thing left to be done: write the Python
CGI script that would take input from the user via the HTML form,
query the database and produce a list of matching game
files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ab580.0x239b7b0"></a>The Python CGI Script</h2></div></div><p>This program, named search.py is presented in Listing 2 [at
<a href="../listings/085/" target="_self">the
<i  >LJ</i> ftp site</a>]. It makes use of two
great modules imported in the third and fourth lines. The CGI
module is almost like magic: it just gets the data submitted by the
HTML form as a Python dictionary. The programmer does not need to
be concerned with details like the method (GET or POST) used to
send form data to the CGI script. Don't you love Python?</p><p>The MySQL module is also easy to use. With four simple
statements, it opens the connection to the desired database, sends
the query, gets the results and stores them in a list of row lists
(a Python list whose members each contain one row).</p><p>The script has the following structure: getting the HTML form
data, creating the database query string according to the form data
and querying a table and printing the matching results.</p><p>Since there is one for each Go tournament, step three is
repeated through a for loop as many times as necessary. The Python
code and the appended comments are rather self-explanatory, so I
will only comment on the lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print '&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://myhost' + \
'/cgi-bin/getsgf.py?file=' + e[0] + '"&gt;'
print e[0] + '&lt;/a&gt;'
</pre><p>Here, e[0] is an SGF file name. Instead of merely printing
the filename (which would be of limited help to the user), the
print statements create an HTML anchor that sends the filename to
the CGI script getsgf.py. This last script (which for the sake of
simplicity will not be shown here) searches for the actual path to
the SGF file and starts a Java applet to display the contents of
the file in a nice, graphical way.
</p><p>Of course, both search.py and getsgf.py must be made
executable and moved to the cgi-bin directory. Also, a final trap
to avoid: all the SGF game files must be placed somewhere within
the DocumentRoot directory (as defined in httpd configuration
files) in order to be found by a CGI script.</p><p>The result of running search.py is displayed in Figure 4 as
seen by the user. Clicking on each filename starts the applet shown
in Figure 5, which gradually displays the moves of the game.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ab580.0x239bff0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Python is a wonderful language. The MySQL module makes it
easy to create small programs to retrieve data from a MySQL
database. Python is also great for CGI scripting. Thus, having a
database available to study through the web browser is just several
lines of code away.</p><p>The application I have shown here is rather limited. The user
can only search for five variables and in a fixed way,
predetermined by the HTML form. However, it is conceivable for the
user to write his or her own database queries through a textarea
input field and view the query results on-line. In fact, the
possibilities are limited only by the programmer's
imagination.</p><p><a href="4544s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
