    These two open-source project management tools can help you
    track your progress on any undertaking.

of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Collins</em></span> dictionary.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Enterprise</em></span> (the focus of this month's issue)
is a word that comes from the French word
<span   class="emphasis"><em>entreprise</em></span>. You see, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>, it is as I told you&mdash;a project or undertaking that
requires boldness or effort. These days, of course, we often refer
to an enterprise as a large-scale business organization.
Nevertheless, the definition still stands.
</p><p>People take on enterprises (or projects, if you will) every
day. The success of these enterprises often is tied closely with
how the project is managed, how carefully it is planned and how
diligently the progress is tracked.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois! Why did you
not tell me it was so late? Our guests are already here.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bonjour mes amis</em></span>, and welcome to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of fine Linux fare and
devastatingly good wine. Fran&ccedil;ois! Bring up the 1996 South
Australia Coonawarra Shiraz
<span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>!</p><p>As I was telling Fran&ccedil;ois, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, the focus of today's menu deals with enterprise,
the taking on of bold, new projects. Aside from the obvious project
management aspects of beginning any enterprise, there seems to be a
great deal of excitement when it comes to charting the status of
any large project. This usually is done with Gantt charts, which
were developed in 1917 by Henry L. Gantt. The familiar horizontal
bar chart was developed as a production control tool to provide a
quick visual means of determining where and how a project was
going, thereby simplifying project management and tracking.</p><p>Here's how it works. A Gantt chart's horizontal axis
represents the time for the project. This can be broken up into
days, weeks or whatever time period makes sense. After all,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, some projects can last an awfully
long time. The vertical axis lists tasks that make up the project.
For instance, I have been restocking the wine cellar here at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. My task list involves an
inventory (Fran&ccedil;ois), some amount of shelf reorganization
(Fran&ccedil;ois), quality control and tasting (Chef Marcel),
placing the orders for more wine (Fran&ccedil;ois and Chef Marcel),
delivery (Henri of Henri's Fine Wines) and finally, restocking
(Fran&ccedil;ois).</p><p>Speaking of Fran&ccedil;ois, our esteemed waiter has
returned. Fran&ccedil;ois, please pour for our guests. You will
love this Coonawarra Shiraz, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. In
addition to the traditional spiciness of the Shiraz, notice the
chocolate in its bouquet, perhaps even a little mint,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? And the taste...but I digress. I was
talking about Gantt charts.</p><p>Tasks are listed with horizontal bars of varying lengths (and
color perhaps) to represent the amount of time spent on the
specific task. At any point in the cycle, you can draw a vertical
line from the top of the chart (more or less) to create a report of
where the project stands. Simple, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p>Simple is the idea behind the Graphical UI Gantt Chart
Generator (originally by Jason R. Govig and Seth Goldstein, now
maintained by Glen Stewart). This web-based system for generating
Gantt charts is simply a collection of CGI scripts. It is perfect
if you are looking for something that allows for easy,
network-available charting.</p><p>It requires Apache and a couple of Perl modules: CGI.pm and
Date::Manip.pm. The easiest way to install these Perl modules is at
the command line using CPAN:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
perl -MCPAN -e "install Date::Manip"
perl -MCPAN -e "install CGI"
</pre><p>I should tell you that you need to do this as root. If you
have never run a Perl CPAN install before, you will be asked a
number of setup questions. This only happens once, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>--other than that, it is a very smooth process. To
use the package, point your web browser to the appropriate URL. On
my system, it looked something like this:
<b  >http://webserver/gantt/</b>.
</p><p>The source for the Gantt chart package is available at
<a href="http://associate.com/gantt" target="_self">associate.com/gantt</a>.
To start, extract the source into your web server's document
root:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf gantt-1.0.tar.gz
mv gantt-1.0 gantt
</pre><p>Notice that I immediately renamed the directory to something
easier. This can be anything you like. Have a look at the
directories under the distribution directory, specifically the one
called users. This entire directory must be writable by whatever
user you have Apache running under (on my system, the user is www).
Look for the user and group in your httpd.conf file.
</p><p>Some modifications are necessary for two files in particular.
The first is variables.pl. The lines to change represent your own
site configuration, including the document root (as discussed
above), the URL to the chart generator, the admin's name and the
admin's e-mail address:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# full path to site on server
$docroot = '/usr/local/apache/htdocs/gantt/';
# URL of site
$wwwroot = '<span   class="emphasis"><em>webserver.yourdomain.dom</em></span>/gantt/';
# Name of site administrator
$admin = '
# Email of site administrator
$adminEmail = 'your_email@yourdomain.dom';
</pre><p>You'll also need to make one small modification to the
dbhelp.pl file, providing it with the path to variables.pl:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Edit this to point to the location of your
# variables.pl file
require \
'/usr/local/apache/htdocs/gantt/variables.pl';
</pre>


Finally, your Apache server's httpd.conf needs a small edit. To
allow CGI scripts to execute from the gantt directory (which lives
under document root), you need something akin to the following
paragraph:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs/gantt"&gt;
    Options ExecCGI
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>


When you restart your web server (<b  >apachectl
graceful</b>), you'll be ready to roll.
</p><p>To use the Gantt chart generator, enter a name into the login
field&mdash;the form actually asks for an e-mail address, but any unique
name will do. If this is the first time through, you'll be
presented with a dialog form to enter your name and contact
information. After you click the Submit button, you can describe
your project and identify the members of your project team.</p><p>Next, you'll list the tasks that will bring about the
successful completion of your new enterprise. Each line is
color-coded and new tasks can be added at any time. With each
update of the page, enter the starting and ending week and the
individual responsible. When you finally click Submit, the chart is
generated automatically (Figure 1).</p><p>

</p><p>Another project well worth your consideration is MrProject
(<a href="http://mrproject.codefactory.se" target="_self">mrproject.codefactory.se</a>).
Part of GNOME Office, this is a desktop-centric application.
Consequently, you may not have to do anything if you installed
GNOME as your desktop (or even if you did not). MrProject can be
found on the distribution CDs of the latest Mandrake, Red Hat, SuSE
and others.</p><p>When you start MrProject for the first time, by typing
<b  >mrproject &amp;</b>, you open up a blank project.
You even can open multiple projects by clicking on New. Notice the
buttons on the left-hand side: Resources, Gantt Chart and Tasks.
Switching from one view to the other is as simple as clicking the
buttons.</p><p>When you start your new project, click File on the menubar
and select Project Properties. Enter the name of the project, its
start date (MrProject has a friendly drop-down calendar to select
from), the manager's name and the organization information. Click
Close, and save the project under a name that makes sense to
you.</p><p>Your next step might be to enter the resources you have at
your disposal for the duration of the project. You do this by
switching to the Resources display and clicking Insert. A default
resource record will be added to the list that you can then
right-click and edit. A resource might be materials or a person's
time. You also can assign cost here.</p><p>Under tasks, select Tasks from the sidebar and click Insert
once again. As with resources, tasks are generic and need to be
edited. These tasks can be described in any way you wish and
assigned to one of your resources. Don't worry about the order in
which you enter these tasks. You can change the order in the list
by selecting a task, then clicking Move up or Move down. The amount
of time allocated to a task is entered in days, but you can enter
portions of days. The percentage of task completion is also entered
here.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6430f2.large.jpg"><img src="6430f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. MrProject's Gantt View
</p></div></div><p>At any point, you can switch to the Gantt view (Figure 2).
What's cool is that you can modify the time on the tasks by
clicking on the horizontal bar and simply dragging it. (I think I
need to allocate more time under &ldquo;Wine tasting and quality
control&rdquo;). Task dependencies also can be added at any time. After
all, some tasks require the completion of other tasks before they
can be started.</p><p>These two are but a few of the packages designed to handle
project management, tracking and charting. If you want to see at
some of the other available offerings out there, I would highly
recommend a visit to the &ldquo;Call Center, Bug Tracking and Project
Management Tools for Linux&rdquo; page
(<a href="http://www.linas.org/linux/pm.html" target="_self">www.linas.org/linux/pm.html</a>).</p><p>Scroll down to the Project Management as well as the
Schedulers, Planners and Gantt Chart Tools section for additional
packages to explore. Offerings come from both the freeware and
commercial software worlds, and each package comes with a brief
description along with links to the package's home page.</p><p>Looking at the clock, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, it seems
as though closing time is nearly here. Perhaps we can take on some
enterprise to extend the days by a few hours. With the skills of
all the open-source programmers of the Linux world, certainly
anything is possible. It is a bold idea, but is that not the
meaning of <span   class="emphasis"><em>enterprise</em></span>? At the very least, we
shall be able to chart our progress,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p>Speaking of progress, I see your glasses are nearly empty.
Let's ask Fran&ccedil;ois to rectify this right away. Until next
month <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, let us all drink to one
another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;</em></span>!
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bon app&eacute;tit</em></span>!</p><p><a href="6430s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
