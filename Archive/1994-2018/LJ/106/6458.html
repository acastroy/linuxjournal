    If you weren't on the boat, here's what happened on Linux
    Lunacy II.

Lunacy II, combined master tech classes and fun shore excursions
with a week-long tour of the Western Caribbean. So far,
<i  >Linux Journal</i> has sponsored two of Neil
Bauman's Geek Cruises. Next year's cruise will head North, from
Seattle up through Alaska's Inside Passage.
</p><p>On Linux Lunacy II, more than 120 Cruisers boarded Holland
America's <span   class="emphasis"><em>ms Maasdam</em></span> in Ft. Lauderdale on
October 20, 2002, for a loop around the Western Caribbean, stopping
at ports of call in Cozumel, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica and the
Bahamas. Sessions were held en route, with attendees gathering in
meeting rooms, dining rooms, bars and theaters. The formats ranged
from keynotes to lectures to master classes to Q&amp;As. Check out
the cruise photo gallery at
<a href="../000/6420.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6420</a>.</p><p>The speaker lineup could hardly be more top-drawer for every
subject: Linus Torvalds and Ted Ts'o on Linux; Randal Schwartz on
Perl; Guido van Rossum on Python and Zope; Steve Oualline on Vi and
C++; Dirk Elmendorf on PHP; Greg Haerr on UI programming and
embedded Linux; Eric S. Raymond on open source, hacker culture and
the Zen of UNIX; Brian Carrier on forensics and Brandon Wiley on ad
hoc serverless communities. I did the keynote on &ldquo;How Linux Got to
Be Everywhere While Nobody Was Watching&rdquo;. The slides from the
keynote are available on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web
site at
<a href="../000/6421.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6421</a>.</p><p>The settings were friendly too. Neil provided power strips so
cruisers could plug in laptops, projectors and other peripherals.
He also arranged with Digital Seas to provide wireless live
internet connectivity, handy for checking out URLs and doing other
research while following a lecture. Each time I checked it,
throughput ran around 150-250KB downstream and 85-120KB upstream.
Not bad for a boat connected to the Net by a satellite 23,500 miles
above the Equator.</p><p>Greg Haerr attended Ted's &ldquo;More than You Ever Want to Know
about Filesystems&rdquo; talk, and he said it, &ldquo;expanded my
understanding of the key details in the design and implementation
of the 2.5 kernel. In conjunction with Linus' talk, I left with
insight into how the kernel guys go about making Linux superior and
a better understanding of the way it's managed.&rdquo;</p><p>Linus spoke three times: once in a long Q&amp;A and two more
times on panels. My ideas about the future of Linux were confirmed
by Linus' talks along with other speakers' presentations on the
ship. To see what we're predicting, read &ldquo;What I Learned on Linux
Lunacy&rdquo; at
<a href="../000/6414.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6414</a>.</p><p>One of Linus' panels met onshore, in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, with
the Jamaica Linux Users Group (JaLUG). The setting was The Ruins
Pub &amp; Internet Caf&eacute;, which is set back in a jungle of
palms and banyan trees beside a perfect waterfall.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6458f1.jpg"></div><p>That meeting took place early in the morning, after which
most of us headed to Dunn's River Falls, which cascades for
hundreds of yards over limestone boulders on its way to the sea.
Dunn's is an interactive river: the idea is to climb it upstream
from bottom to top. It's a little scary but a lot of fun. We
probably set a new record for the number of otherwise smart people
carrying digital cameras up the middle of a cascading jungle river.
For a full description of all the events, see parts 1 and 2 of
&ldquo;Geeks on the Half Shell 2.0: Cruising the New Dominion with Linus
and Friends&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6419.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6419</a>
and
<a href="../000/6422.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6422</a>,
respectively).</p><p>For the next cruise, we're moving the schedule up to
September 13, 2003. We sail out of Seattle for Alaska's Inside
Passage aboard Holland America's flagship, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Amsterdam</em></span>. &ldquo;It's an incredible ship&rdquo;, Neil
says&mdash;and he ought to know. The itinerary includes Victoria,
Juneau, Sitka, Ketchikan and Hubbard Glacier.</p><p>Last year our family went on another of Neil's cruises to
Alaska. The sights run from stunning to spectacular. The whole trip
flanks jagged snowcapped mountains feeding the sea with rivers,
streams and some of the most spectacular glaciers in the world.
There's nothing quite like floating next to the business end of a
glacier for half a day, watching huge hunks of it &ldquo;calve&rdquo; off
into icebergs the size of buildings. And that's just what you do on
the boat. The shore excursions include helicopter trips, dog
sledding...all kinds of fun stuff.</p><p>Commitments so far suggest there's a good chance Neil will
sell out early this year. Visit the Geek Cruises site
