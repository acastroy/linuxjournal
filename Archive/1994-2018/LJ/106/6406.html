your poll tells me that readers are interested in the practical
uses of the OS as a day-to-day computing platform. Could more
non-tech reviews be in order? I recently went shopping for a Linux
machine. The &ldquo;Dell Dude&rdquo; didn't want to talk to me unless I was
willing to give some money to a guy in Redmond; however, from your
pages I contacted the nice folks at ASA Computers. Their agent Sean
acted as if I were a major buyer, and in no time I had a nice, new
Linux workstation delivered to my door.</p><p>&mdash;Michael Presley</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29f8580.0x2af02f0"></a>Please Run Microsoft Ads!</h2></div></div><p>In the November 2002 issue [Letters, page 6], Renato Carrara
told you not to run Microsoft ads. I present you the top five
reasons <span   class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> run MS ads in
<i  >LJ</i>: 1) Bill Gates is NOT evil. 2) MS ads in
<i  >LJ</i> would be proof that we won the OS battle!
We all remember when MS ignored us, claiming that Linux had too
small of a user base to be interesting. 3) Let
<i  >LJ</i> readers, not staff, make the decision on
whether the offer is hot or not. 4) If MS pays money to
<i  >LJ</i> for bringing an ad, we, the
<i  >LJ</i> readers, end up with a better magazine! 5)
Linux is not just about having access to source code. It is also
about freedom&mdash;freedom of choice, free markets and free
competition. MS ads cannot disillusion, scare or harm us! They can
only make us stronger!</p><p>&mdash;Martin A. BoegelundBjerringbro, Denmark</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29f8580.0x2af0660"></a>Memory Leaks No More</h2></div></div><p>I just read the article about memory leak detection in the

Italians were united by wars between 1861 and 1918, but we are
still using our pre-unitarian languages, or &ldquo;dialects&rdquo;, so I
really appreciate the localization effort. But at a global scale,
actually the English language is used as a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lingua
franca</em></span> for the diffusion of scientific and informatics
knowledge. If we eliminate such an instrument we'll break the free
transmission of ideas. I think that we must have care of both sides

by Jon Hall, featured in the September 2002
<i  >LJ</i>, from a friend who lives in the US and who
was quite worried about some things the article mentioned regarding
what you call &ldquo;the Landless Movement&rdquo; in Brazil.</p><p>Although the cause of this movement may look noble, there are
many things related to this group that should have been considered
before publishing that article and stamping their flag on the
magazine's cover. The group, known here in Brazil as MST, has a
radical political position, and they are responsible for some
actions that could be seen as terrorist acts, such as mass killings
and unauthorized land occupation including invading and destroying
a farm that belongs to Brazil's president, Mr. Fernado Henrique
Cardoso. The group's default way of acting is by the use of brute
force and they usually threaten people to get what they want.
Everything I'm mentioning here can be easily checked. A simple
search on major Brazilian newspapers will show that the MST isn't
worth trust or being featured on a magazine such as <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Mr. Jon Hall, with all due respect, should try
to find out better who he is supporting or featuring.</p><p>&mdash;Bruno Trevisan</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall replies:</b></span>
The group of people that I was introduced to, and who appear in the
picture, were introduced to me by Mr. Marcos Mazoni, the President
and CEO of PROCERGS. PROCERGS is the government-owned software
company that is doing a lot of the open-source programming for the
state of Rio Grande do Sul. The group also showed up at the third
annual Software Livre! conference, which was sponsored in part by
PROCERGS, and attended by the Mayor of Porto Alegre and a
representative from UNESCO. There was no mention or indication that
this was a &ldquo;terrorist group&rdquo;. However, in light of Mr. Trevisan's
letter I went back to Brazil and did some more research, both
directly and indirectly, by reading and by talking to people who I
trust and by doing a little web-scouring of my own.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6406f2.jpg"></div>
</p><p>In Brazil about 60% of the land is owned by 1% of the
population. A lot of this land lies idle, while millions of people
are out of work and have no way to generate money or food. Since
1984, MST has won land for approximately 250,000 families in 1,600
settlements, but there are still another 4.8 million families
without the means to support themselves. MST is building
cooperatives, building agro-industries, building and staffing
day-care centers, teaching literacy classes to 25,000 adults,
helping to educate 150,000 children in 1,200 public schools, and
they are proud of their nonviolent direct action in the form of
land occupations. I have lived through quite a few other
&ldquo;actions&rdquo; in my lifetime. The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s
and the anti-Vietnam War movement come to mind. Both of these had
their peaceful incidents and incidents that were not so peaceful.
However, to judge a whole movement and its motives by the actions
of a small minority of them is wrong. If the whole movement of the
MST is indeed bad, and if they are indeed terrorists, then I have
good company in the number of people and agencies that have been
duped by them. It appears that UNESCO, the Catholic Church, and
even parts of former President Cardoso's own judiciary and elected
officials supported the MST.</p><p>Actually, from the documentation I found, it seems that the
nonpeaceful and &ldquo;terrorist&rdquo; actions seems to have come from the
former government of Brazil, with the killing of many of the
protesters by government forces and the lack of action by the
government in holding their killers responsible. One article
written by Mark S. Lagevin, a professor of Global Studies at
Pacific Western University, says there were 969 assassinations of
rural workers and MST activists, with only five people convicted of
those crimes. Hopefully, the new government will be more
responsive.</p><p>Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, of the Brazilian Worker's Party
(PT) is now the President of Brazil. In the past the PT has helped
to support the MST in its quest for land reform, and I hope this
continues. Not relying on only newspaper articles and web sites, I
asked several of my Brazilian friends what they thought of the MST
movement. Each of them stated that while they deplore any type of
violence, the good that the MST movement generates is many times
better than the reported bad actions of a few, and that the past
government had not been responsive to more than reasonable requests
for land reform. Therefore, they supported the MST overall.</p><p>However, I was informed by a friend in S&atilde;o Paulo that
representatives of Microsoft were taking copies of <i  >Linux Journal</i> to
people in business and telling them that I was not an honorable
person because I was associated with the MST group, and by default
if I am not honorable, then the Open Source movement must not be
honorable. Therefore, I would like to set the record straight as to
what type of person I am. I believe in free speech, a democratic
process and freedom of choice. I believe in nonviolence and have
never physically hurt anyone in anger. I have never been in jail,
never been arrested and have received only two speeding tickets in
my entire life (which I paid). I do not believe that killing a
human being for anything less than immediate threat of life (my own
or another person's) is ever justified, yet I would go to war to
protect my country and its ideals if we were attacked. I believe in
equality of the races and sexes, and I believe in honoring
diversity in religion and sexual orientation. I believe that the
duty of government is to honor the will of the majority as long as
it does not violate the rights of the minority. I honor laws, even
those that I am not completely happy about, believing that it is
better to change them than to break them. I encourage people to
think about what the law means, and what it would be like if there
were no laws. Finally, I have never even been accused in court
(local, state or federal) of being a monopoly, breaking the law or
knowingly harming another person's business or the consumer by my
business tactics. As for my association with the MST group, and my
picture alongside their flag, I repeat that my interest was in
seeing people who had little money and great ideals using a free
and open operating system to help their cause and better their
lives. On this path I will continue to walk. With respect to Mr.
Trevisan, I have encouraged <i  >Linux Journal</i> to publish his letter,
and this response. For those of you who are interested in the MST
movement, I offer their web site at
