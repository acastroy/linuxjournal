    The pros and cons of four web development tools:
    mod_perl/Mason, J2EE, Zope and OpenACS.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x258e580.0x26865b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>If someone asked you to name the best car
on the market, you'd probably tell them the answer depends on who
will use the car. After all, a family of eight living in Manhattan
probably needs a different type of vehicle from a single hacker
living in rural North Dakota. The same is true for programming
languages and development toolkits. Each has its place and is
appropriate for solving different sorts of problems.
</p><p>Although this might seem obvious, many programmers believe
the language or toolkit they use is so good it should be used to
solve all problems, all of the time. As the old saying goes, if
your only tool is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. No
programming language is the best fit for all problems, which is why
experienced programmers know and use a variety of languages and
constantly are learning new ones.</p><p>Until only a few years ago, programmers were largely
concerned with optimizing their programs for speed and memory
usage. After all, processors were relatively slow, and RAM was
fairly expensive, so any program that didn't try to squeeze the
most out of the hardware was seen as bloatware.</p><p>Today, however, we are blessed with cheap, fast computers and
cheap, plentiful RAM. This means that software engineers can and
should use languages that encourage rapid development and long-term
program maintenance. I'm not against optimizing programs for speed
or memory usage, but they are less important than creating stable,
maintainable software quickly and easily.</p><p>About two years ago, I decided I would devote a long series
of columns to four basic web development technologies:
mod_perl/Mason, J2EE, Zope and OpenACS. These technologies are not
only interesting and useful but thought-provoking as well,
providing new perspectives and ideas for web developers. And
although occasional arguments arise among these communities about
which product is superior, the fact is that each tries to solve a
slightly different type of problem.</p><p>This month, we take some time to summarize the ideas and
frameworks that we've explored over the last few years. I don't
expect that everyone reading my column will jump to use all of the
technologies I name here; however, I do hope to provide even the
most die-hard aficionados with some food for thought.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x258e580.0x2686870"></a>mod_perl/Mason</h2></div></div><p>Apache is deservedly one of the poster children of the Open
Source movement. It is reliable, highly configurable, well
documented, stable and extensible. You can do amazing things with
Apache and can customize it in any number of ways to fit your
needs. If you are writing a web application that must execute as
quickly as possible, you can write a new module in C that
seamlessly hooks into Apache.</p><p>Although C programs execute quickly and Apache libraries (now
known as the Apache Portable Runtime) provide a great deal of
useful infrastructure and support for module authors, development
in C is slower and more prone to bugs than working with a
high-level language such as Perl or Python. So it shouldn't come as
any surprise that there are Apache modules that embed these
languages inside of the Apache server. mod_perl allows you to write
Apache modules in Perl, rather than C, giving you nearly unlimited
control over your server with all of the speed and flexibility of
Perl.</p><p>And indeed, mod_perl comes to mind whenever someone asks me
to create a high-performance web application, particularly one that
involves text processing or a relational database. I could write
the module in C, but why bother? There are times when it makes
sense to code in C, but I've generally found mod_perl to be fast
enough for even high-powered applications.</p><p>Of course, the wonder of mod_perl diminishes somewhat when
graphic designers enter the scene. Designers have no interest in
modifying program code whenever they want to change the style (or
content) on a given page, and giving them access to the source code
of Perl modules is asking for trouble. Thus, dozens of different
templating systems are available, each of which allows you to mix
Perl and HTML in a slightly different way. One of the most popular
is Mason, which has been used on a large number of heavy-duty
publishing sites for years.</p><p>Mason is indeed a wonderful tool, and it provides an
excellent trade-off between rapid development (thanks to Perl),
easy maintenance (thanks to Mason) and fast execution (thanks to
mod_perl). The Mason e-mail list is a source of useful information
and support, and the package maintainers have done an admirable job
of improving it steadily over time. Configuring, using and
debugging modern versions of Mason make the versions that I first
used several years ago appear primitive in comparison.</p><p>At the same time, Mason is an infrastructure and framework
for creating your own applications. True, you easily can use
Apache::Session to generate cookies and associate users with a
unique ID, but anything having to do with user registration, groups
and permissions, let alone full-fledged applications, are your
responsibility to implement. For some projects, this is just fine,
because it gives you the flexibility you may need. But the fifth
time you find yourself creating a system for creating and managing
users, groups and permissions, you may decide you need something
with a bit more infrastructure.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x258e580.0x2686b30"></a>Java and J2EE</h2></div></div><p>Sun has been pushing Java as a server-side solution for
several years now, and J2EE (Java 2, Enterprise Edition) is the
umbrella for a variety of technologies that are meant to help
developers create such solutions. Servlets are classes that execute
code on a server; JavaServer Pages (JSPs) are Java/HTML templates
that are compiled into servlets on the fly. JDBC allows you to
access the database, and Enterprise JavaBeans provide you with
transactions and automatic relational-to-object mapping. Entering
the world of Java requires learning a huge number of acronyms and
technologies, as well as learning the various versions for
different standards.</p><p>I've been working with Java at various times since it was
first released, and on nearly every occasion, I find myself wanting
to get excited about it but being unable to do so. Java isn't bad,
per se, and the different technologies it brings to the table are
all rather impressive. Servlets are easy to write; JSPs (and
especially the custom tags you can create for JSPs) are a mature
and impressive templating system, and JDBC provides everything you
would ever want in a database interface. And although EJB is
undoubtedly overkill for most projects, it is extremely useful for
the big enterprise development groups that Sun is targeting. In
addition, multiple implementations, including fine open-source
application servers and tools, are impressive and
encouraging.</p><p>Indeed, Java seems to be the &ldquo;big company&rdquo; of the web
development world. It gets things done reliably; it has an enormous
array of talent at its disposal and follows a huge number of
standards; oodles of development tools are available, and a lot of
people are using Java. But the overhead associated with Java
projects is too large for my liking. Simply learning which version
of which standard goes with which version of which Jakarta
subproject can take a fairly long time. Just as it's typically more
fun to work at a small company than a large one, I find it more
interesting to program in Perl or Python than in Java.</p><p>Moreover, J2EE suffers from problems similar to those I
described with mod_perl and Mason, namely the fact that it's purely
infrastructure, without any attention paid to built-in
applications. Developers can create amazing things but must
reinvent the wheel for each project.</p><p>Perhaps my favorite part of the Java world is the attention
to maintainable and reliable software. A fair number of testing and
development tools, such as Ant, Cactus, JUnit and log4j make it
possible (and even relatively straightforward) for programmers to
create and manage comprehensive testing of software before it is
released.</p><p>So, is Java a good choice for web development? I would argue
that the larger your project, the more seriously you should
consider Java. But for the typical basic web application that small
shops work on, the overhead associated with development is too
great to ignore.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x258e580.0x2686df0"></a>Zope</h2></div></div><p>Zope is clear proof that open-source software does more than
imitate its proprietary competition. Zope combines an object
database with a multiprotocol server, hooking them together with a
rich set of objects and a slick web-based management interface.
Zope is innovative, clever, a pleasure to work with and one of the
rare open-source projects designed with end users, not just
hackers, in mind. Graphic designers love to hear that they can
revert to any previous version of a document by using the undo
feature in the web-based management interface.</p><p>Zope has a number of programming interfaces, each of which
trades off simplicity for power. You can create simple DTML
templates and Python scripts, use the fascinating ZPT templates
that completely separate programs from the display logic, or you
can go all the way and create a new Zope product. Zope products are
where the real power is, and because each product is a class, you
can create multiple instances of your product at different URLs.
Because objects inherit via the URL hierarchy (acquisition) in
addition to their native object hierarchy, the permissions,
behavior or look and feel of a product instance can vary according
to its URL.</p><p>So far, it sounds like Zope is the best thing that happened
to the Web since HTTP. And indeed, the growing number of Zope
hackers means a large number of products are available for free
download, as well as a growing number of commercial products that
use Zope as their underlying infrastructure.</p><p>However, Zope has a few problems, the first and biggest one
being that the learning curve can be rather steep. Even if you're
an experienced web developer, Zope requires that you re-learn
nearly all of the concepts from scratch, changing almost all of the
habits you've acquired over the years. This isn't necessarily a bad
thing, as Zope implements it so well, but it can be a surprise and
a reason to be wary, simply because using Zope inevitably will slow
things down during the initial startup period.</p><p>The other issue I have with Zope is its object database.
Object databases historically have had a lot of problems, and ZODB
appears to be bucking that trend nicely. At the same time,
relational databases are still pretty standard, and people expect
(and often need) to work with them. In theory, this isn't a
problem. Zope's built-in ZSQL methods allow you to do fascinating
things with relational database queries without thinking very hard.
The problem then is that your data is split across two different
locations: ZODB and your relational database. I like to keep all of
my data in one central location, which means this split can
frustrate me somewhat.</p><p>There is also the issue of speed. Zope's sophisticated
permissions and acquisition mechanism is probably faster than you
or I could implement on our own, but it still can be relatively
sluggish. The official Zope solution for this problem is ZEO (Zope
Enterprise Objects), which allows multiple Zope servers to access a
single object database. This apparently scales to one million hits
per day, which is more than adequate for most of the sites I work
on. But exceptionally large sites may need to worry about how
quickly Zope operates or alternatively, consider investing in some
high-end hardware for the central ZODB server.</p><p>Finally, Zope products tend to be relatively independent. The
good news is that this allows developers to work in parallel,
without slowing each other down. The bad news is that things are
not as unified as they could be, with repeated functionality and a
lack of coordination. This may be inevitable in an open-source
project of this magnitude, but it can be frustrating at
times.</p><p>Over the last year or two, Zope Corporation has been pushing
the use of Zope for content management, rather than for application
development. Of course, any decent content management system needs
to be modified and reprogrammed for the needs of the customer, so
the difference isn't that pronounced. Although Zope is not the only
open-source content management system on the market, it is
undoubtedly one of the most sophisticated, as well as one of the
most mature.</p><p>In my own work, I pitch Zope to clients whose projects will
involve a fair amount of tricky development, on those that require
a relatively easy to use interface or those that require content
management. I continue to be impressed by it and look forward to
working with Zope quite a bit in the years to come.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x258e580.0x26871b8"></a>OpenACS</h2></div></div><p>OpenACS began as a sophisticated data model for community web
sites, along with a large number of web/database templates written
in Tcl. Over time, it has grown into a much larger project with a
number of facets: independent packages that can upgrade both
programs and the data model, the ability to work seamlessly with
either Oracle or PostgreSQL and a sophisticated templating system
that separates programs from the HTML output. And, OpenACS comes
with a huge number of prebuilt applications that do about
everything you would want for a community web site, from weblogs to
fora and FAQs to an ecommerce store. With nothing more than your
web browser, you can create a site in very little time.</p><p>And indeed, I find myself recommending OpenACS again and
again to nonprofits that want to create on-line communities, reach
out to their constituents, conduct discussions among the members or
publicize information easily, without needing to know much in the
way of technology.</p><p>That said, OpenACS has a number of issues. First and foremost
is the learning curve. Zope's learning curve is difficult because
there are so many technologies to understand. OpenACS has a much
simpler model, but it stores absolutely everything in a relational
database. This means the data is all in one place, but relational
databases are notoriously bad at dealing with hierarchies, and all
of the clever OpenACS developers in the world cannot mask
that.</p><p>Thus, learning to work with OpenACS requires that you learn
how to implement a simple object inheritance system and the
extensive API that allows you to do it. If you haven't ever written
stored procedures or worked with databases containing dozens or
hundreds of tables, then you may be overwhelmed by the knowledge
necessary to work with OpenACS.</p><p>OpenACS also suffers from little documentation for developers
and none for end users. OpenACS is admittedly a complex system that
can be difficult to describe to nontechnical people, but it can be
maddening to find nothing to help with that. To their credit, the
main <a href="http://openacs.org" target="_self">openacs.org</a> site was
recently remodeled and rewritten shortly before I wrote this
article and seems to have made some positive headway in this
direction.</p><p>Finally, I find it somewhat ironic that OpenACS has become
increasingly sluggish over time. Granted, this is because the
latest version (4.x, as of this writing) is far more clever about
users, groups and permissions than its predecessors, and checking
these things with each HTTP request takes time. In addition, the
developers know many optimizations still can be made, such that
each request doesn't require quite so many database queries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x258e580.0x26874d0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Several days before I wrote this article, a new report
appeared on the Web describing how Yahoo has settled on PHP as a
web programming environment. I personally prefer to work in other
languages and wouldn't relish the idea of rewriting all of Yahoo in
a new language. But for Yahoo's particular needs, it seems like PHP
is indeed a good choice. I give them credit for considering all of
the options, weighing the pluses and minuses and coming to a
conclusion that fit their needs.</p><p>As I said at the beginning of this article, I am a firm
believer in finding a technology that meets the needs of the
problem at hand. As a developer, this means I'm constantly forced
to learn new languages, technologies and techniques. At the same
time, this means my clients can get a solution that's appropriate
for their problems, and I gain broader skills and depth as a
software engineer.</p><p>The fact that these systems are available free of charge via
the Internet means that the only thing stopping you from trying
them is time and some effort. I strongly encourage you to find the
time to work with them; you and the people you work with will
undoubtedly enjoy the results.</p><p><a href="6431s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
