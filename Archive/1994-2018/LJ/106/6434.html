    Understanding the USB-to-serial layer and how to get devices
    into it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203f580.0x2137450"></a></h2></div></div><p>In my last column [see
<i  >LJ</i> December 2002], we covered the serial layer
in the 2.5 (hopefully soon to be 2.6) kernel tree. We mentioned in
passing that a USB-to-serial driver layer in the kernel helps out
in working with those types of device drivers. This time we discuss
that layer in more depth.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203f580.0x21375b0"></a>USB Serial Layer's History</h2></div></div><p>A long time ago (in kernel development time, at least), a
single USB-to-serial device driver was written and accepted into
the kernel tree. It barely worked for one type of device and didn't
work at all on SMP machines. As no standard USB-to-serial protocol
existed, all devices used a custom protocol created by the
individual vendors. The reason why there is no standard protocol is
a long and sordid story; check the archives of the linux-usb-devel
mailing list for the details. Soon a second type of USB-to-serial
device was implemented within the first driver, sharing the
reserved major and minor numbers. Over time, more and more devices
were added to the driver until it was becoming an unwieldy mess.
With the help of Peter Berger and Al Borchers, the original author
of the driver rewrote the infrastructure and created what is now
known as the USB-to-serial layer. This bit of code allows different
USB-to-serial drivers to be written with a minimal amount of code,
all sharing the same major and minor number range. It insulates the
individual drivers from some of the complexity in the tty layer and
the USB layer. It also allows the drivers to be compiled as
individual modules and loaded only when they are needed.</p><p>In the 2.5 development cycle, the serial layer was created in
order to provide an easier way to write serial port drivers, so as
not to have to deal with the tty layer directly. Hopefully, someday
the USB and serial layers will be merged. Both maintainers want to
see this happen, but they do not have the time to do it. (They
would gladly accept patches to accomplish this, if someone is
looking for a project.)</p><p>In this article we cover the basics of the USB-to-serial
layer, detailing how to register and unregister a driver and how to
set up the main structures needed for a driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203f580.0x2137768"></a>Registering and Unregistering a USB Serial
Driver</h2></div></div><p>All of the code and examples in this article are for the
2.5/2.6 kernel tree. The 2.4 and 2.2 kernel trees also support
USB-to-serial drivers, but their interfaces are a bit different in
places. For ease of use, we focus on only one kernel tree. If you
have any problems porting a USB-to-serial driver to these older
trees (once it is running on 2.5), please let me know.</p><p>To register a USB-to-serial driver with the kernel, the
driver has to do two things: register with the USB-to-serial core
and register with the USB core. Registering with the USB-to-serial
core tells it to call your driver when new devices are found by the
USB subsystem, and registering with the USB core is needed to tell
it what kind of devices your driver can accept.</p><p>To register with the USB core, all you need is a list of USB
devices that your driver will work for, in traditional USB device
ID format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static struct usb_device_id id_table [] = {
        {USB_DEVICE(MY_PRODUCT_ID, MY_DEVICE_ID)},
        {}     /* Terminating entry */
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE (usb, id_table);
</pre><p>This table is needed so the USB core knows what devices the
driver can accept and the user-space hot-plug code knows what kind
of devices are used. See my article &ldquo;How the PCI Hot Plug Driver
Filesystem Works&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i> May 2002, for more
information about this table and how the hot-plug code uses it.
</p><p>Then, a simple USB device-driver structure is created with
this ID information:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static struct usb_driver tiny_driver = {
        .name =         "tiny",
        .probe =        usb_serial_probe,
        .disconnect =   usb_serial_disconnect,
        .id_table =     id_table,
};
</pre><p>The .probe and .disconnect fields must be set to point to the
USB serial core's functions because that type of logic is handled
by it and not by your driver.
</p><p>Then, a simple call registers this driver with the USB
core:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
usb_register (&amp;tiny_driver);
</pre><p>After this, the USB serial driver must be notified of the
driver with a call to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
usb_serial_register (&amp;tiny_device);
</pre>


This function takes a pointer to a struct usb_serial_driver_type,
which will be explained in the following section.
</p><p>To unregister a driver, the same steps have to happen, but in
reverse order. First, we unregister with the USB serial
core:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
usb_serial_unregister (&amp;tiny_device);
</pre><p>Then, we unregister with the USB core:
<pre     class="programlisting">
usb_unregister (&amp;tiny_driver);
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203f580.0x2137df0"></a>struct usb_serial_device_type Explained</h2></div></div><p>To register with the USB serial core, the
usb_serial_device_type structure must be filled. This structure can
be found in drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.h and is defined as the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct usb_serial_device_type {
  struct module *owner;
  char *name;
  const struct usb_device_id *id_table;
  char num_interrupt_in;
  char num_bulk_in;
  char num_bulk_out;
  char num_ports;
  struct list_head driver_list;
  int (*probe) (struct usb_serial *serial);
  int (*attach) (struct usb_serial *serial);
  int (*calc_num_ports) (struct usb_serial *serial);
  void (*shutdown) (struct usb_serial *serial);
  int  (*open) (struct usb_serial_port *port,
                struct file * filp);
  void (*close) (struct usb_serial_port *port,
                 struct file * filp);
  int  (*write) (struct usb_serial_port *port,
                 int from_user,
                 const unsigned char *buf,
                 int count);
  int  (*write_room) (struct usb_serial_port *port);
  int  (*ioctl) (struct usb_serial_port *port,
                 struct file * file,
                 unsigned int cmd,
                 unsigned long arg);
  void (*set_termios) (struct usb_serial_port *port,
                       struct termios * old);
  void (*break_ctl) (struct usb_serial_port *port,
                     int break_state);
  int  (*chars_in_buffer)
         (struct usb_serial_port *port);
  void (*throttle) (struct usb_serial_port *port);
  void (*unthrottle) (struct usb_serial_port *port);
  void (*read_int_callback)(struct urb *urb);
  void (*read_bulk_callback)(struct urb *urb);
  void (*write_bulk_callback)(struct urb *urb);
};
</pre><p>This is a rather large structure, but it's still smaller than
either the tty layer's structure or the combination of the serial
layer's structures, both of which are alternatives to using the USB
serial layer.
</p><p>Let us describe what all of these fields are used for and
whether they are necessary. The owner field is a pointer to the
module that owns this device. It should be set to the THIS_MODULE
macro. When this is set, the module reference count logic is
handled by the USB serial core, which is much safer than trying to
do it on your own.</p><p>The name field is a pointer to a string that describes this
device. This string is used in the syslog messages when a device is
inserted or removed. It is also used in the
/proc/tty/driver/usb-serial file to show what device is connected
to what port.</p><p><a href="6434s1.html" target="_self">The /proc/tty/driver/usb-serial
File</a></p><p>The id_table field is a pointer to a list of usb_device_id
structures that define all of the devices this structure can
support. This field can be identical to the pointer that is passed
to the USB core. If your driver needs to do different things for
different types of devices, however, you can set up different
structures describing these devices. An example of this is the
Keyspan driver, which handles all of the Keyspan USB serial devices
and needs different functions to be called for different
devices.</p><p>The num_interrupt_in field is the expected number of
interrupt in endpoints this device will have. An endpoint is a USB
term, defined in the USB spec
(<a href="http://www.usb.org" target="_self">www.usb.org</a>). If you do
not care about having the USB serial core check for this value
(matching it up against any seen devices), use the NUM_DONT_CARE
macro defined in usb-serial.h.</p><p>The num_bulk_in and num_bulk_out fields state the number of
bulk in and bulk out endpoints this device will have. Again, the
NUM_DONT_CARE macro can be used here if you do not want the core to
pay attention to this value.</p><p>The num_ports field indicates the number of different ports
this device will have. A single USB serial device can contain many
different physical serial ports.</p><p>The driver_list field is used by the USB serial core to keep
track of all the different drivers registered with it; it should
not be used by the individual drivers.</p><p>The rest of the fields in the structure are all optional
function pointers. If a field is not set, the generic USB serial
driver's related function will be called. This allows a driver to
be written with a minimal amount of code, if it happens to work the
same way as the generic driver does. If not, almost all of these
functions will need to be defined. These function pointers are
divided into three groups: USB life-cycle pointers, tty life-cycle
pointers and urb callback pointers.</p><p><a href="6434s2.html" target="_self">The Generic USB Serial
Driver</a></p><p>USB life-cycle function pointers consist of probe,
calc_num_ports, attach and shut down. They are all called at
different points in time as a USB device is initialized and
shutdown. The probe function is called when a device matching one
of the the id_table devices is inserted into the system. This call
happens before the device has been fully initialized by the USB
serial core. It can be used to download any needed firmware to the
device. In addition, any other early-initialize commands that the
device needs can be sent at this time. If 0 is returned, the USB
serial core continues on with the initialization sequence. Any
other value will abort the call and notify the USB core that this
device is not claimed by any drivers.</p><p>The calc_num_ports function is called to determine how many
ports this device has. This should be used only by devices that can
dynamically determine their ports. Any return value overrides the
num_ports field in the usb_serial_device_type structure. It is
called after the probe function is called but before the attach
function is called.</p><p>The attach function is called when the struct usb_serial
structure is fully set up. Any local initialization of the device
or any private memory structure allocation can be done in this
function. The shutdown function is called when the device has been
removed from the system. Any local memory allocated for this device
should be freed up at this time.</p><p>tty layer function pointers consist of open, close, write,
write_room, ioctl, set_termios, break_ctl, chars_in_buffer,
throttle and unthrottle. If you recall the article on the tty layer
[&ldquo;The tty Layer&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i> August 2002],the these
match up with the tty layer function call of the same name, with a
few twists. First off, they all pass in a pointer to the specific
usb_serial_port structure that is being operated on, and some of
the functions are only called when something needs to
happen.</p><p>The open function is called the first time open() is called
on a port, but not for any subsequent calls to open(). Any urb
submission the driver needs to do to start receiving data, or any
device-specific messages that should be sent, should be done at
this time. If any errors occur, they should be returned; otherwise,
return 0 to signal success.</p><p>The close function is called for the last close() call, which
is called from user space. Any running urbs should be shut down,
and any device-specific commands that are needed should be sent
now.</p><p>The write function is called exactly like the tty layer write
function is called. The data passed to the function needs to be
sent to the specified port. The number of bytes sent to the device
should be returned. Remember, the device does not have to send all
of the data that the user wants it to; a short write can happen, as
long as the driver notifies user space that this has happened. This
allows the driver logic to be much simpler. If an error happens, it
should be returned as a negative number.</p><p>The write_room and chars_in_buffer functions are closely
related. The write_room function is called by the tty layer to ask
how many bytes the driver can accept to be written out at this
time. The chars_in_buffer function is called to find out the number
of bytes still left to be sent to the device.</p><p>The ioctl function is called with a wide range of tty ioctl
values. If the driver cannot handle the specific value,
-ENOIOCTLCMD should be returned. This will allow the tty layer to
try to provide a default function. Some of the more common values
asked for by user space are documented in the tty driver article
previously mentioned.</p><p>The set_termios function is called to set terminal settings
for a specific port. This includes baud rate, flow control, data
bits and other line settings. The break_ctl function is called to
set the BREAK value for the port. A state of -1 means that the
BREAK status should be turned on, and a status of 0 means it should
be turned off. The throttle and unthrottle functions are used to
stop and resume data being received from the serial port.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203f580.0x21387e8"></a>urb Callback Function Pointers</h2></div></div><p>The read_int_callback, read_bulk_callback and
write_bulk_callback function pointers are all used by the USB
serial core to set up the initial callbacks for these kinds of USB
endpoints. If the driver does not specify the read or write bulk
callback functions, the generic callbacks are used. There is no
generic read interrupt callback function, so if your device has an
interrupt endpoint, you must provide this callback.</p><p>The operation of the generic read bulk callback adds the data
received by the USB urb to the port's tty buffer, to be sent to
user space when read() is called. It then resubmits the urb to the
device. If your device does not need to interpret the data received
in any way, I recommend using this function instead of writing a
new one. The generic bulk write callback is much smaller and only
wakes up the tty layer (in case it was sleeping, waiting for data
to be transmitted to the device).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203f580.0x2138948"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>In this article we have explained how to register and
