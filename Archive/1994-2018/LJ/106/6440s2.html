<h3>Already Solving Real World Problems</h3>
<p>
The following examples show the performance of three HPC scientific
applications on an SGI Altix 3000 system running Linux. These examples
are FASTA for bioinformatics, Gaussian for computational chemistry
and STAR-CD for computational fluid dynamics. All testing was conducted
by SGI.
<p>
<B>FASTA Bioinformatics Example</B>
<p>
Although biochemistry and computational biology have existed since
the mid-1980s, bioinformatics is a fairly new scie.pngic realm,
made possible by the convergence of data-intensive life sciences
research, laboratory-automation technologies and the development of
computer databases and algorithms that can rapidly organize, process
and distribute enormous quantities of data. Bioinformatics is used to
help bring new drugs to market faster, prevent genetic disease, develop
disease- or drought-resistant crops, extend the shelf life of food, find
alternatives to petroleum and create foods of the future that will help
manage cholesterol or prevent cancer.
<p>
Sequence database searching is among the most critical areas of
bioinformatics due to the rapidly growing volume of publicly available
biological data. Classical algorithms like Smith-Waterman (T. F. Smith
and M. S. Waterman, 1981, <I>Journal of Molecular Biology</I>
147:195-197)
provide the most rigorous way to search biological databases for local
sequence similarities. However, Smith-Waterman is computationally
demanding, so parallelization is extremely important for making
this algorithm efficient. One parallel Smith-Waterman implementation
available is the FASTA bioinformatics package (W. R. Pearson, 1991,
<I>Genomics</I> 11:635-650).
<p>
The Smith-Waterman algorithm from FASTA version 3.4 (ssearch34_t),
which is available from the University of Virginia
(<a href="http://alpha10.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta">alpha10.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta</a>), was used
to measure parallel performance on a 64-processor SGI Altix 3000
system. Smith-Waterman is parallelized with Pthreads, and the SGI ChemBio
Applications team also further tuned the core algorithm to more fully
exploit the capabilities of the SGI Altix 3000 system. As a result,
the Smith-Waterman algorithm shows close to ideal scaling (dotted line
represents ideal scaling) with speedups of approximately 59&times;
when running on 64 processors.

<B>Gaussian Computational Chemistry Example</B>
<p>
National research laboratories, universities, pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies and chemical companies use computational
chemistry applications like Gaussian 98 from Gaussian, Inc.
(<a href="http://www.gaussian.com">www.gaussian.com</a>) for research in molecular energies,
properties and reactions by modeling very large molecular systems using
electronic structure methods.
<p>
In Figure II, the parallel scaling of Gaussian 98 on a widely
used test from Gaussian's QA-suite is shown using an early
prototype SGI Altix 3000 system and an earlier version of the Intel
compilers targeting Itanium processors rather than Itanium 2 processors.
The case corresponds to a Force calculation of the Valynomycin molecule
(C54H90N6O18), using Density Functional Theory. The graph shows the
parallel speedups for this test case; the labels are the elapsed times
in seconds. Even with the early tools and system versions used, the time
to perform this calculation is reduced from about 4.5 hours to only
25 minutes when using 20 processors on an SGI Altix 3000 system.

<B>STAR-CD Computational Fluid Dynamics Example</B>
<p>
Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used in many traditional industries
such as automotive, aerospace and power generation. STAR-CD from
Computational Dynamics Limited (<a href="http://www.cd-adapco.com">www.cd-adapco.com</a>) is one
of the CFD technology leaders for fluid flow analysis. It can assist
a CFD user from initial fundamental design, through parametric studies
to optimization, using its advanced physical models and its ability
to handle complex geometry using unstructured meshes. STAR-CD runs
on all leading UNIX and NT platforms. Its parallel form, STAR-HPC,
runs on shared-memory multiprocessor servers, massively parallel
systems and clusters of workstations. STAR-HPC uses the MPI library
to achieve a high degree of scalability. Using a prerelease version
of STAR-CD on an SGI Altix 3000 system with the &ldquo;Model A Class
Dataset&rdquo; for modeling turbulence flow on an automobile, Linux
again demonstrates excellent processor scaling up to 64 processors
based on early performance runs. According to published results at
<a href="http://www.cd-adapco.com/support/bench/aclass.htm">www.cd-adapco.com/support/bench/aclass.htm</a> as of early November
2002, Linux even scaled better than two proprietary operating systems:
Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX and IBM AIX.
