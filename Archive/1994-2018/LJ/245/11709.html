A Web application allowing everyday users to control the Raspberry Pi.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2480778"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The pi-web-agent is a Web application that aims to give new users
experience with the Raspberry Pi and potentially with any Linux
distribution on any architecture.
Raspberry Pi has introduced Linux to a lot of people, and we want to
further enhance their experience. This project also demonstrates the
extensibility capabilities of Linux.
</p><p>
What we provide enables you to install the pi-web-agent as soon as you
have Raspbian (<a href="http://www.raspbian.org" target="_self">www.raspbian.org</a>) installed. You'll simply be able to open your
usual browser
from your everyday machine and start interacting with your Pi.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2480930"></a>
The Product</h2></div></div><p>
The idea behind pi-web-agent is to support desktop environment
functionality on browsers and provide extensions that behave similarly
to mainstream desktop applications. If you have used GNOME or KDE, you will
have noticed that each provides its own set of applications.
</p><p>
pi-web-agent is similar
to Webmin (<a href="http://www.webmin.com" target="_self">www.webmin.com</a>), with the difference being that pi-web-agent targets 
everyday users. We want to give users a desktop experience
through their browsers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2480ae8"></a>
Main Features</h2></div></div><p>
The moment you launch pi-web-agent (after changing your
password of course), you will realize that it already provides a lot of
functionality despite its youth. On the left-hand side, you'll see some
information concerning your Pi, such as its temperature, kernel version,
update notifications, disk and memory usage.
</p><p>
The home screen (Figure 1) will check whether
an update for the pi-web-agent is available. If it is, a button will
appear that will download and install the new version of the application
for you.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11709f1.large.jpg"><img src="11709f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. pi-web-agent Home Screen 
</p></div></div><p>
The navigation menu reveals the standard extensions that every desktop
environment provides for users to interact with the underlying
operating system, including power management for shutting down and restarting,
and a package management section where we provide some of our favourite and
useful applications with the capability to install them, enabling you
to get started fast. One of the most important extensions is 
VNC, which provides the TightVNC
server and gives you access to your real Pi desktop with the Glavsoft
TightVNC client Java
applet.
</p><p>
The firewall management, despite its early stage, enables you
to avoid the fuss of many complicated options that
iptables provides from the command line (until you
become an expert). You can set rules for various chains, block certain
IP addresses or allow connections through different protocols (Figure
2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11709f2.large.jpg"><img src="11709f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Firewall View When Clicking on a Certain Chain
</p></div></div><p>
Clicking the &ldquo;Other&rdquo; tab will reveal more extensions. The camera
controller enables you to take snapshots and even begin your own live
stream! We also provide a media player (tagged as radio, since it started
as such), where you can provide a URI of an audio file or a streaming
radio channel. Your Raspberry Pi will start playing the audio, so get ready
to attach your HD speakers!
</p><p>
You also can play an audio file straight from your Pi, but don't bother
typing the URI in the text box. Find it through the file browser we
provide. Although it's simple in functionality for now, it enables you to
browse through your files, and download or choose to play audio files with
the pi-web-agent's media player extension. (Note: this functionality
is available only from the development branch on GitHub, but it will be
available in version 0.3.)
</p><p>
The media player extension is an MPlayer port
that also enables you to control the sound with an equalizer (Figure
3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11709f3.large.jpg"><img src="11709f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Media Player View When Listening to an Audio File or Streaming
</p></div></div><p>
If you want to be more hard-core and play with some wires and
LEDs, we provide an extension for controlling the GPIO pins on your Pi
(check out the interface in Figure 4). You also can check
for updates or update your system and turn services on or off. There is
more to come, so keep yourself posted via our Facebook page (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/piwebagent" target="_self">https://www.facebook.com/piwebagent</a>)
We want you to forget you are
using a Web browser and not bother clicking the VNC
option.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11709f4.large.jpg"><img src="11709f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2481640"></a>
How It Works</h2></div></div><p>
The pi-web-agent is served by
Apache (<a href="http://www.apache.org" target="_self">www.apache.org</a>). Some claim that Apache is big and heavy, but we
believe it has the
most chances of incorporating cutting-edge technology. If you don't
know what this means, check out mod_spdy with the SPDY protocol from
Google (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/mod-spdy" target="_self">https://code.google.com/p/mod-spdy</a>). We also can choose among a variety of modules that can
increase pi-web-agent's potential. For those of you who want a
lighter HTTP server, we are going to release a pi-web-agent modification
after the API is complete.
</p><p>
The core is written in Python and interacts via the Common Gateway
Interface (CGI) to provide dynamic content. Our goal is also to provide
an API, so almost every module is able to generate JSON data, making
the application highly extensible both for us and for third-party
developers. This will give us a lot of flexibility for future
products we plan to deliver.
</p><p>
The styling currently is achieved with bootstrap (<a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_self">getbootstrap.com</a>) using
the Flatly (<a href="http://bootswatch.com/flatly" target="_self">bootswatch.com/flatly</a>) theme. User interaction mainly is achieved via
JavaScript calls and rendering the document on the client side (most
of the time). Our rule of thumb is to move as much processing from the
Raspberry (server side) to the more powerful machine that runs the browser
(client side).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x24819b0"></a>
Current Status</h2></div></div><p>
pi-web-agent is in a very early stage. It started in October 2013 at
HackManchester (<a href="http://www.hackmanchester.com" target="_self">www.hackmanchester.com</a>), winning the University challenge
prize. The first version (0.1) was released on December 27, 2013, and the
second release (0.2) followed in April 2014.
</p><p>
The current stage of development has three phases:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The development of version 0.3, which will introduce framework
improvements. This also involves better extension management. As the
number of the provided extensions grows, we want users to choose what
they want, and install and uninstall them at will. This will significantly
reduce long installation times caused by dependencies (dependencies
of the camera controller introduced 100MB of dependency packages).
</p></li><li><p>
The development of the pi-web-agent for Android, which also includes
the optimization of the API. 
</p></li><li><p>
The design and development of the pi-web-agent version 1.0. We want this
to look like a real desktop environment, and we also want to achieve this
in no more than a year.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
pi-web-agent is open source, and it's easy
for you to get involved&mdash;just fork our main git
repository (<a href="http://www.github.com/vaslabs/pi-web-agent" target="_self">www.github.com/vaslabs/pi-web-agent</a>), and
send us your changes through pull requests.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2478710"></a>
Using pi-web-agent</h2></div></div><p>
Imagine your Raspberry Pi has just arrived and you have installed Raspbian
on your SD card. Even if you don't have much experience with Linux and
the command line, worry no more. You can connect to your Pi with SSH and
install the pi-web-agent, which will help you in your first steps. While
you become more experienced with the Pi and Linux, the pi-web-agent will grow with
you, giving you more powerful capabilities and making your interaction
with your Pi more enjoyable.
</p><p>
The most difficult task you'll face is the installation process,
especially if you run a headless Debian distribution on your Raspberry
Pi. You won't be able to avoid executing commands (until we release a
Raspbian mod with the pi-web-agent included). You need to connect with
your Pi via SSH. There are two ways to install the pi-web-agent, which
are described below.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2478870"></a>
Installing through pistore</h2></div></div><p>
If you are using a Linux machine, it's easy. Just do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -X pi@raspberrypi
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-X</tt> will enable you to execute graphical applications. Provide your
password to the prompt, and then launch the pistore by typing the following
and then pressing Enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pistore
</pre>
</p><p>
When pistore opens, just register and search
for pi-web-agent. Everything else is straightforward.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2478b30"></a>
Installing via the Command Line</h2></div></div><p>
If you are not on a Linux machine, or if your distribution is headless, you
still can install pi-web-agent easily. The following commands will
fetch and install pi-web-agent:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wget https://github.com/vaslabs/\
    pi-web-agent/archive/0.2-rc-1.zip
unzip 0.2-rc-1.zip
cd pi-web-agent-0.2-rc-1
./install.sh 
./run.sh
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2478c90"></a>
Troubleshooting</h2></div></div><p>
We've started a discussion on
Reddit that covers
a lot of troubleshooting, thanks to users' questions (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/249j4r/piwebagent_control_your_pi_from_the_ease_of_your" target="_self">www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/249j4r/piwebagent_control_your_pi_from_the_ease_of_your</a>). You can find guidelines
on how to install under various circumstances and how to resolve problems
that others already have faced. All the issues identified in this discussion
have been resolved, but if you face a new one, just post a new comment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2478df0"></a>
Supported Platforms</h2></div></div><p>
The pi-web-agent framework is based on the micro-CernVM (Scientific
Linux) appliance agent framework developed at CERN in summer 
2013 (<a href="https://github.com/cernvm/cernvm-appliance-agent" target="_self">https://github.com/cernvm/cernvm-appliance-agent</a>). We developed pi-web-agent based on
that framework. We've modified it to work on Raspbian and cover the
needs of the Raspberry Pi users. However, it is possible to use it on
various Linux distributions with minor modifications concerning Apache
configuration and replacing Raspberry Pi-specific modules, such as the
Update and the GPIO.
</p><p>
We plan to release pi-web-agent version 1.0 for Raspbian, Pidora
and Arch. Until then, the only officially supported platform is Raspbian.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2478fa8"></a>
Developing on pi-web-agent</h2></div></div><p>
It is possible to extend the pi-web-agent by adding new Python
modules. 
Upon creating a Python module, you'll find that the best way to work is
to follow the structure below:


<pre     class="programlisting">
if 'MY_HOME' not in os.environ:
    os.environ['MY_HOME']=
        '/usr/libexec/pi-web-agent'
sys.path.append(os.environ['MY_HOME']+
                    '/etc/config')
from framework import output

def main(): 
    output('Title', 'Hello my first module')
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</pre>
</p><p>
There are a lot of modules and methods you can use to get the most
out of the framework. The most important is the output, which takes
care of what's appearing on your browser. You can give two arguments,
the title and the HTML, as the main content of your extension.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2479210"></a>
Framework Overview</h2></div></div><p>
The framework is composed of various Python modules and configuration
files. The configuration files initially were in XML format, but they
have been converted to JSON format, which reduced the codebase by a
significant amount.
</p><p>
The core module is framework.py, placed
in the /usr/libexec/pi-web-agent/etc/ config
directory. This module uses view.py and menu.py, which also use
HTMLPageGenerator.py and BlueprintDesigner.py to construct the Web site
skeleton. All the information about which modules are in use is in
config.cfg in the same directory with the framework.py.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2479370"></a>
Adding Features</h2></div></div><p>
When you create your first module, you'll need to register it to the
config.cfg file in order to be placed in the
navigation menu. You'll also find that you can declare its version
as Alpha or Beta. More options will be added soon, such as dependencies
(next version 0.3) of a corresponding feature.
</p><p>
When a feature is added to the configuration file, the framework places
it in the navigation menu with the URL provided in that file. There are
two types of URL links: one for reloading the whole page and one for
updating just the extension view (append <tt  >?type=js</tt>).
Since version 0.2,
we started using the second format, and the first format is deprecated.
</p><p>
When clicking to select a feature, a JavaScript routine is triggered
that loads the content of the extension in the appropriate area, where
the user can interact with it. It is important to note that all user
interface renderings will be performed on the client side exclusively
by version 1.0.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2479580"></a>
The Future</h2></div></div><p>
Reading through this article, you will have noticed that there are a lot of
things pending and even more that can be improved. This is our goal:
to develop a solid application, not only to satisfy users, but also to
provide a good environment for other developers to extend or build on top of
the pi-web-agent. That's why we have started multiple spin-off projects.
</p><p>
We have started a bunch of help projects in order to make life
easier for us, users and third-party developers. We created a
benchmark (<a href="https://github.com/azardilis/testing-fw" target="_self">https://github.com/azardilis/testing-fw</a>) that gives
us the loading times of each feature. We also started a plugin for
the gedit text editor (the &ldquo;official&rdquo; text editor of our dev team)
to automate the creation and deployment of pi-web-agent extensions.
</p><p>
Last but not least, we are developing pi-web-agent for Android. Not
only have we started this application to increase user satisfaction, but it
also is the driver for the pi-web-agent API, which will be given out
officially, ready and documented, for third-party developers to build on.
In addition, the API will be solely used for the creation of pi-web-agent
version 1.0.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x24797e8"></a>
What Needs to Be Done</h2></div></div><p>
pi-web-agent is in an early stage, but it needs support from special
tools to speed up the development process. Now that the framework has
started to be more stable in terms of changes, we need to finish the
gedit development plugin.
</p><p>
Next, we need to finish the pi-web-agent API very soon, and the
pi-web-agent for Android will help shape a well-defined and documented
API. Then, we will extend the framework to encapsulate the API modules
both on client and server side. We plan to create the client side
framework using Dart (<a href="https://www.dartlang.org" target="_self">https://www.dartlang.org</a>).
</p><p>
We also plan to start a new spin-off project that will be a Web site for
hosting extensions for pi-web-agent, which users will be able to
install via the Web application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x24799f8"></a>
Our Team's Goals</h2></div></div><p>
Following the Android model, we want to build a platform to act as a
desktop environment for the Raspberry Pi, which will be able to expand
via extensions or Activities. A different Web site will act as a market
and host those extensions. Developers will be able to register and
publish their own extensions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2388580.0x2479b00"></a>
Get Involved</h2></div></div><p>
The project is small&mdash;as it should be at this point. We want you, the
users, to get involved before we start over-engineering things and making
the pi-web-agent a big ugly piece of code that doesn't meet your needs.
</p><p>
There are a lot of things and ideas that need to be implemented. The
pi-web-agent is already a product that is released in approximately
a three-month cycle. You can become involved by sending us e-mail with
recommendations, following us on GitHub, and forking and contributing to
the repository. If you are new to any of these, don't worry; just send
us your questions, and we'll get you started.
</p><p>
If visualizing a desktop environment in a Web browser is not so exciting
for you, you can contribute to any of the spin-off projects that aim to
boost the pi-web-agent development process. Here is a list of all the
projects and their repositories:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The pi-web-agent is a product that aims to replace the desktop
environment with a Web-based alternative. HTML5 and CSS3 technology has
made this possible. Along with the Linux extensibility, we chose to start
with the Raspberry Pi, as it's the perfect platform for educational and
experimental purposes. The Raspberry Pi also has the resource limitations
we need, with the idea that if it runs fast on a Raspberry Pi, it will
be super-fast on mainstream machines.
</p><p>
We already are developing a new design that brings the feel
of a mainstream desktop environment. Figure 5, which demonstrates the dock
navigation menu and the windowing system, provides a sneak peek of the new
design.

As we mentioned already, we also need a lot of help. If you are a Python/CSS/HTML/JavaScript
expert with some free time and a passion for open source, don't hesitate

Vasilis Nicolaou, pi-web-agent's founder, is maybe the biggest Linux lover
on the team, 
at his job and maybe in other groups and places. He even knows
what Linus Torvalds does daily better than Linus himself. Vasilis loves open
source, Python, Java (don't tell that to Linus), Raspberry Pi and new
technology in general, which (as Linus says) is what keeps him interested
in programming. He graduated from the University of Manchester with an MEng
degree in 
Software Engineering.
</p><p>
Angelos Georgiadis is a Java programmer who became a Python expert for the sake
of pi-web-agent. He probably is the best chance of keeping
pi-web-agent alive if Vasilis is hit by a bus tomorrow. He is the number-one suspect when something breaks in pi-web-agent and is probably
responsible, since he has blown the repository quite a few times (17-ish).
</p><p>
Georgios Chairepetis is a young programming enthusiast, currently 
studying for an MSc in Software Engineering at the University of
Manchester. He got involved with the rest of the pi-web-agent team initially 
by taking part in a hackathon contest and was lucky enough to win an
award in the first competition he ever attended. He enjoys staying inside
on Saturdays doing some programming with friends, but he also likes to
go outside and enjoy the sunshine, maybe with some beer, when he has
the chance.
</p><p>
Andreas Galazis has been a junior Web developer for six months. The fact that 
his favourite Linux application is MPlayer is somewhat misleading, as he 
spends most of his time coding rather than watching movies or listening
to music, but when he does, he wants to do it the proper way. When he
heard about pi-web-agent, he decided to join forces to develop an
extension to demonstrate the power of his favourite media player.
