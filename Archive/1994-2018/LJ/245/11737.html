<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #245, September 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Sometimes a new piece of code turns out to be more useful than its author
suspected. <span   class="bold"><b>Alejandra Morales</b></span> recently came
out with the <span   class="bold"><b>Cryogenic Project</b></span>
as part of his Master's thesis, supervised by <span   class="bold"><b>Christian Grothoff</b></span>. The idea
was to reduce energy consumption by scheduling input/output operations in
batches.
</p><p>
This idea turned out to be so good that <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter
Anvin</b></span> didn't want
Cryogenic to be a regular driver, he wanted it to be part of the core Linux
input/output system. On the other hand, he also felt that the programmer
interface needed to be cleaned up and made a bit sleeker.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pavel Machek</b></span> also was highly impressed and remarked that this could save
power on devices like phones and tablets that were always running low. And,
Christian confirmed that this was one of the main goals of the code.
</p><p>
Christian added that power savings seemed to be on the order of 10%, though
that number could be tweaked up or down by increasing or decreasing the
amount of delay that was tolerable for each data packet.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Lang</b></span> also liked Cryogenic and agreed that it should go into the core
input/output system. He added that a lot of other folks had attempted to
accomplish similar things. It was a highly desired feature in the kernel.
David also pointed out that in order to get into the core input/output
system, the Cryogenic code would have to demonstrate that it had no
performance impact on code that did not use its features, or that the
impact would be minimal.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Luis R. Rodriguez</b></span> recently pointed out that a lot of drivers were routinely
backported to a large array of older kernels, all the way down to version
2.6.24. And although he acknowledged that this was currently manageable, he
expected the number of drivers and other backportable features to continue
to increase, making the situation progressively more difficult to sustain.
</p><p>
Luis said the kernel folks should do more to educate users about the need
to upgrade. But, he also wrote up a recommendation that the kernel folks use
<span   class="bold"><b>Coccinelle</b></span> to automate the backporting
process (<a href="http://www.do-not-panic.com/2014/04/automatic-linux-kernel-backporting-with-coccinelle.html" target="_self">www.do-not-panic.com/2014/04/automatic-linux-kernel-backporting-with-coccinelle.html</a>).
</p><p>
Coccinelle is a tool used to transform source code programmatically. It can
be used to generate changes to earlier kernel code to match the
functionality provided by newer patches. That's so crazy, it just might
work!
</p><p>
But to get started, Luis wanted to draw a line between kernels that would
receive backports and kernels that would not. Hopefully, that line would
only move forward. So he asked the linux-kernel mailing list members in general,
which were the earliest kernels they really needed to keep using.
</p><p>
As it turned out, <span   class="bold"><b>Arend van Spriel</b></span> knew of
<span   class="bold"><b>Broadcom WLAN testers</b></span> that still
relied on <span   class="bold"><b>Fedora 15</b></span>, running the 2.6.38 kernel. He said he was working with
them to upgrade to <span   class="bold"><b>Fedora 19</b></span> and the 3.13 kernel, but that this hadn't
happened yet.
</p><p>
So it appears that a certain amount of backporting will become automated,
but of course, the Coccinelle transformations still would need to be written
and maintained by someone, which is why Luis wanted to limit the number of
target kernels.
</p><p>
It turns out <span   class="bold"><b>Windows</b></span> does certain things
better than Linux&mdash;for example, in
the area of rebooting. Apparently, there are several techniques that can be
done in software to cause a system to reboot. But in some cases, the Linux
system will go down successfully, and then not come up again. This is a
problem, for example, in server farms with minimal human staff. If 20
systems are acting up and you want to reboot them all, it's easier to give
a single command from a remote terminal, than to send a human out into the
noise and the cold to press each reset button by hand.
</p><p>
One rebooting technique involves sending certain values to the <span   class="bold"><b>0xCF9 port</b></span>
on the system. Another is to use the <span   class="bold"><b>EFI</b></span> (Extensible Firmware Interface)
BIOS replacement from <span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span>. Depending on the circumstances, one or the
other rebooting technique is preferred, but the logic behind that selection
can be tricky. In particular, changing the state of various pieces of
hardware can change the appropriate reboot technique. So, if you run
through a series of reboot attempts, and somehow change hardware state
along the way, you can find that none of the attempts can succeed.
</p><p>
The cool thing about this particular bug is the straightforward way
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> said that Windows must be doing something right, and the Linux
people needed to figure out what that was so Linux could do it right too.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Steven Rostedt</b></span> pointed out the boot failure in one of his systems, and this
triggered the bug hunt. Part of the problem is that it's very difficult to
understand exactly what's going on with a system when it boots up. Strange
magical forces are apparently invoked.
</p><p>
During the course of a somewhat heated debate, <span   class="bold"><b>Matthew Garrett</b></span> summed up what
he felt was the underlying issue, and why the problem was so difficult to
solve. In response to any of the various bootups attempted, he said,
&ldquo;for
all we know the firmware is running huge quantities of code in response to
any of those register accesses. We don't know what other hardware that code
touches. We don't know what expectations it has. We don't know whether it
was written by humans or written by some sort of simulated annealing
mechanism that finally collapsed into a state where Windows
rebooted.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Matthew was in favor of ditching the 0xCF9 bootup technique entirely. He
argued, &ldquo;We know that CF9 fixes some machines. We know that it breaks some
machines. We don't know how many machines it fixes or how many machines it
breaks. We don't know how many machines are flipped from a working state to
a broken state whenever we fiddle with the order or introduce new
heuristics. We don't know how many go from broken to working. The only way
we can be reasonably certain that hardware will work is to duplicate
precisely what Windows does, because that's all that most vendors will ever
have tested.&rdquo;
</p><p>
But, Linus Torvalds felt that ditching CF9 was equivalent to flailing at the
problem. In the course of discussion he said, &ldquo;It would be interesting if
somebody can figure out <span   class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> what Windows does, because the fact that
a lot of <span   class="bold"><b>Dell</b></span> machines need quirks almost
certainly means that it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>us</em></span>
doing something wrong. Dell doesn't generally do lots of fancy odd things.
I pretty much guarantee it's because we've done something odd that Windows
doesn't do.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The discussion had no resolution&mdash;probably because it's a really tough
problem that hits only a relatively small number of systems. 
Apparently the bug hunt&mdash;and the debate&mdash;will continue.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Quit Thumbing Your Passwords!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #245, September 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I use my phone more often to log in to on-line accounts than I use a
computer. I can assure you it's not because typing passwords on a tiny
keyboard is fun. For most of us, we just have instant access to our phones
at any given time during the day. The big problem with always using a
tiny phone is that it means logging into tiny Web sites (especially if
there is no mobile version of the site) with tiny virtual keys and a
long, complex password. It makes for real frustration.
</p><p>
With PasswordBox, you not only can store your user names and passwords, but
also log in to those Web sites with a single click. Once you authenticate
with your master password to the PasswordBox app, it will allow you to
create login profiles for dozens of sites and give you the ability to
add entries for your own personal sites. If you want to log in to your
bank with your phone, but don't want anyone to see you type in your
banking credentials, PasswordBox is the perfect tool for you.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11737androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11737androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
With great power comes great responsibility, and it's important to
understand what PasswordBox allows you to do. When you initially
launch it, you'll be prompted for how you desire the application to
handle when it locks your data and requires you to retype the master
password. Ideally, this would be &ldquo;immediately after you quit the app&rdquo;,
but PasswordBox allows you to sacrifice security for convenience and
will stay unlocked anywhere from 30 seconds to several hours. It 
even will let you rely on your Android lock screen for security and never
prompt you for your master password!
</p><p>
Even with its potential for insecurity, PasswordBox is a powerful and
convenient tool that makes using your phone much less burdensome when
logging in to on-line services. In fact, it greatly can improve security
as you won't need to type in your banking information in plain sight of the
guy next to you at McDonald's. For those reasons, PasswordBox gets this
month's Editors Choice Award. Check it out today at <a href="http://www.passwordbox.com" target="_self">www.passwordbox.com</a>.

<h2 class="title">One Charger to Rule Them All</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #245, September 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If you're anything like me, your nightstand is full of electronic devices
that need to be charged regularly. Every night I have:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Nexus 7 tablet.
</p></li><li><p>
Cell phone.
</p></li><li><p>
Kindle Paperwhite.
</p></li><li><p>
iPad Air.
</p></li><li><p>
Fitbit.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Granted they don't all need a daily charge, but the two tablets and
cell phone certainly do. Although many of you are probably tsk'ing me for
buying an iPad, for this purpose, it's a fine example of a device that
is finicky about being charged. Many tablets, the iPad especially,
require a lot of amperage to charge properly. Enter the Anker 40W,
five-port USB charger.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11737ankerf1.large.jpg"><img src="11737ankerf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Before buying the Anker, I had to get a power strip in order to plug in
all the wall-warts required to charge my devices. Two of those devices
(the Fitbit and Kindle) didn't even come with power adapters, just
USB cables to plug in to a computer for charging. With the Anker USB
charger, I'm able to use a single, regular-sized power cord to charge
all my devices. Because it's designed specifically to charge, it has some
great features as well:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Dynamic, intelligently assigned amperage, up to 2.4 amps per port (8 amps max for
all ports combined).
</p></li><li><p>
Compact size (about the size of a deck of playing cards).
</p></li><li><p>
Supports Apple, Android and other USB-based charging.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I've been using the Anker charger for several weeks and absolutely love
it. There also is a 25 watt version if you don't need the full 40 watts,
but I highly recommend getting the larger version, just in case you need
more power in the future.
</p><p>
I purchased the charger on Amazon for $26, and although that's more than
I'd normally pay for a USB charger, it's more like getting five chargers
in one. Check it out at <a href="http://www.ianker.com/support-c7-g345.html" target="_self">www.ianker.com/support-c7-g345.html</a>.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: AutoHotkey</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #245, September 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Text expansion and hotkey automation are the sort of things you don't
realize you need until you try them. Those of you who ever have played with
system settings in order to change the function of a keystroke on you
system understand the value of custom hotkeys.
</p><p>
For Windows users, the customization of keystrokes is pretty limited
with the system tools. Thankfully, the folks at <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com" target="_self">www.autohotkey.com</a> have
created not only an incredible tool for creating scripted hotkeys, but
they've also included automatic text expansion/replacement for speed
boosts on the fly.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11737fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11737fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Programming the hotkeys and text replacements is pretty straightforward,
and the Web site offers plenty of tutorials for making complex scripts for
elaborate automation. Even if you just want to do a few simple hotkeys,
however, AutoHotkey is a tool you really want to check out. Best of all,
it's completely open source, so there's no reason not to go download
it today!

<h2 class="title">Lucidchart</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #245, September 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I am a visual learner. When I try to teach something, I naturally like
to use visual examples. That usually involves me working for hours to
create flowcharts in Google Docs using the drawing program. Yes, it
works, but it's a very cumbersome way to create a flowchart. Thankfully,
I recently discovered Lucidchart (<a href="http://www.lucidchart.com" target="_self">www.lucidchart.com</a>).
</p><p>
Lucidchart is an on-line service that provides a free way to create
flowcharts quickly and easily. Once the flowchart is created, items can
be dragged around, resized and modified while still staying connected. I
used Lucidchart for this month's Open-Source Classroom column, and if you
need to create a quick flowchart, I recommend you give it a try as well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11737lucidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11737lucidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Lucidchart provides its service for free, but there also are paid
tiers that give you more options, such as importing and exporting Visio
documents and so on. There certainly are other more powerful charting tools
available, but few are as simple and quick to use.

<h2 class="title">Open Axiom</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #245, September 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Several computer algebra systems are available to Linux users. I
even have looked at a few of them in this column, but for this issue, I discuss
OpenAxiom (<a href="http://www.open-axiom.org" target="_self">www.open-axiom.org</a>). OpenAxiom actually is a fork of Axiom. Axiom originally
was developed at IBM under the name ScratchPad. Development started in 1971,
so Axiom is as old as I am, and almost as smart. In the 1990s, it was
sold off to the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG). In 2001, NAG removed it
from commercial sale and released it as free software. Since then, it has
forked into OpenAxiom and FriCAS. Axiom still is available. The
system is specified in the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>AXIOM: the Scientific Computation
System</em></span> by Richard Jenks and Robert Sutor. This book is available on-line
at
<a href="http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/hyperdoc/axbook/book-contents.xhtml" target="_self">wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/hyperdoc/axbook/book-contents.xhtml</a>,
and it makes up the core documentation for
OpenAxiom. 
</p><p>
Most Linux distributions should have a package for OpenAxiom.
For example, with Debian-based distributions, you can install
OpenAxiom with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install openaxiom
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to build OpenAxiom from source, you need to have a
Lisp engine installed. There are several to choose from on Linux, such as
CLisp or GNU Common Lisp. Building is a straightforward:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./configure; make; make install
</pre>
</p><p>
To use OpenAxiom, simply execute <tt  >open-axiom</tt> on the command line. This
will give you an interactive OpenAxiom session. If you have a script of
commands you want to run as a complete unit, you can do so with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
open-axiom --script myfile.input
</pre>
</p><p>
where the file &ldquo;myfile.input&rdquo; contains the OpenAxiom commands to be
executed.
</p><p>
So, what can you actually do with OpenAxiom? OpenAxiom has many different
data types. There are algebraic ones (like polynomials, matrices and power
series) and data structures (like lists and dictionaries). You can combine
them into any reasonable combinations, like polynomials of matrices
or matrices of polynomials. These data types are defined by programs in
OpenAxiom. These data type programs also include the operations that can
be applied to the particular data type. The entire system is polymorphic
by design. You also can extend the entire data type system by writing
your own data type programs. There are a large number of different
numeric types to handle almost any type of operation as well.
</p><p>
The simplest use of OpenAxiom is as a calculator. For example, you can
find the cosine of 1.2 with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cos(1.2)
</pre>
</p><p>
This will give you the result with 20 digits, by default. You can change
the number of digits being used with the <tt  >digits()</tt>
function. OpenAxiom
also will give you the type of this answer. This is useful when you are
doing more experimental calculations in order to check your work. In
the above example, the type would be <tt  >Float</tt>. If you try
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
4/6
</pre>
</p><p>
the result is <tt  >2/3</tt>, and you will see a new type,
<tt  >Fraction Integer</tt>. If
you have used a commercial system like Maple before, this should
be familiar. 
</p><p>
OpenAxiom has data types to try to keep results as exact
values. If you have a reason to use a particular type, you can do a
conversion with the <tt  >::</tt> operator. So, you could redo the above division
and get the answer as a float with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(4/6)::Float
</pre>
</p><p>
It even can go backward and calculate the closest fraction that matches
a given float with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
%::Fraction Integer
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >%</tt> character refers to the most recent result that you
calculated. The answer you get from this command may not match the
original fraction, due to various rounding errors. 
</p><p>
There are functions
that allow you to work with various parts of numbers. You can
<tt  >round()</tt> or
<tt  >truncate()</tt> floating-point numbers. You even can get just the fractional
part with <tt  >fractionPart()</tt>. 
</p><p>
One slightly unique thing in OpenAxiom is a
set of test functions. You can check for oddness and evenness with the
functions <tt  >odd?()</tt> and <tt  >even?()</tt>. You
even can check whether a number is
prime with <tt  >prime?()</tt>. And, of course, you still have all of the standard
functions, like the trigonometric ones, and the standard operators,
like addition and multiplication.
</p><p>
OpenAxiom handles general expressions too. In order to use them, you
need to assign them to a variable name. The assignment operator
is <tt  >:=</tt>. One thing to keep in mind is that this operator will execute
whatever is on the right-hand side and assign the result to the name on
the left-hand side. This may not be what you want to have happen. If so,
you can use the delayed assignment operator <tt  >==</tt>. Let's say you want to
calculate the square of some numbers. You can create an expression with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xSquared := x**2
</pre>
</p><p>
In order to use this expression, you need to use the <tt  >eval</tt> function:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
eval(xSquared, x=4)
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can have multiple parameters in your expression. Say you wanted
to calculate area. You could use something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xyArea := x * y eval(xyArea, [x=2, y=10])
</pre>
</p><p>
The last feature I want to look at in this article is how OpenAxiom
handles data structures. The most basic data structure is a list. Lists
in OpenAxiom are homogeneous, so all of the elements need to be the same
data type. You define a list directly by putting a comma-separated group
in square brackets&mdash;for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[1,2,3,4]
</pre>
</p><p>
This can be done equivalently with the <tt  >list</tt>function:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
list(1,2,3,4)
</pre>
</p><p>
You can put two lists together with the <tt  >append</tt> function:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
append([1,2],[3,4])
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to add a single element to the front of a list, you can use
the <tt  >cons</tt> function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cons(1, [2,3,4])
</pre>
</p><p>
List addressing is borrowed from the concepts in Lisp. So the most
basic addressing functions to get elements are the functions
<tt  >first</tt>
and <tt  >rest</tt>. Using the basic list from above, the function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
first([1,2,3,4])
</pre>
</p><p>
will return the number 1, and the function:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
rest([1,2,3,4])
</pre>
</p><p>
will return the list [2,3,4]. Using these functions and creative use
of loops, you can get any element in a given list. But, this is very
inconvenient, so OpenAxiom provides a simpler interface. If you had
assigned the above list to the variable <tt  >mylist</tt>, you could get the third
element with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mylist.3
</pre>
</p><p>
or, equivalently:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
mylist(3)
</pre>
</p><p>
These index values are 1-based, as opposed to 0-based indexing in
languages like C. 
</p><p>
A really unique type of list available is the infinite
list. Say you want to have a list of all integers. You can do that with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
myints := [i for i in 1..]
</pre>
</p><p>
This list will contain all possible integers, and they are calculated
only when you need the value in question. You can have more complicated
examples, like a list of prime numbers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
myprimes := [i for i in 1.. | prime?(i)]
</pre>
</p><p>
One issue with lists is that access times depend on how big the list
is. Accessing the last element of a list varies, depending on how big
said list is. This is because lists can vary in length. If you have a
piece of code that deals with lists that won't change in length, you
can improve performance by using an array. You can create a one-dimensional array
with the function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
oneDimensionalArray([2,3,4,5])
</pre>

This assigns a fixed area of memory to store the data, and access time
now becomes uniform, regardless of the size of the list. Arrays 
also are used as the base data structure for strings and vectors. You 
even can create a bits data structure. You could create a group of eight
1-bits with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bits(8,true)
</pre>
</p><p>
In this way, you can begin to do some rather abstract computational work.

As you have seen, OpenAxiom, and its variants, are very powerful systems
for doing scientific computations. I covered only
the very basic functionality available here, but it should give you a feeling
for what you can do. In the near future, I plan to take another look
at OpenAxiom and see what more advanced techniques are possible,
including writing your own functions and programs.
