How many days have elapsed? Our intrepid shell script programmer Dave
Taylor looks at how to solve date-related calculations and demonstrates a
script that calculates elapsed days between any specified day in the past
and the current date.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x191c580.0x1a14358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In case you haven't been reading my last few columns or, perhaps, are
working for the NSA and scanning this content to identify key phrases, like
&ldquo;back door&rdquo; and &ldquo;low-level vulnerability&rdquo;, we're
working on a shell script that calculates the number of days between a
specified date in the past and the current date.
</p><p>
When last we scripted, the basic functionality was coded so that the script
would calculate days from the beginning date to the end of that particular
year, then the number of years until the current year (accounting for leap
years), followed by the current number of days into the year.
The problem is, it's not working.
</p><p>
Here's the state of things:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date
Mon Jul  7 09:14:37 PDT 2014
$ sh daysago.sh 7 4 2012
The date you specified -- 7-4-2012 -- is valid. Continuing...
0 days transpired between end of 2012 and beginning of this year
calculated 153 days left in the specified year
Calculated that 7/4/2012 was 341 days ago.
</pre>
</p><p>
The script correctly ascertains that the current date, July 7, 2014, is 153
days into the year, but the rest of it's a hopeless muddle. Let's
dig in to the code and see what's going on!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x191c580.0x1a14720"></a>
Two Versions of <tt  >date</tt> = Not Good</h2></div></div><p>
The code in my last article was fairly convoluted in terms of calculating the
number of days left in the starting year subsequent to the date specified
(July 4, 2012, in the above example), but there's a far easier way,
highlighted in this interaction:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date -j 0803120010
Tue Aug  3 12:00:00 PDT 2010
$ date -j 0803120010 +%j
215
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, modern <tt  >date</tt> commands let you specify a date (in
MON DAY HOUR MIN YEAR format) and then use the <tt  >%j</tt> format notation to get
the day-of-the-year for that specific date. August 3, 2010, was the 215th
day of the year.
</p><p>
Did you try that, and find that
<tt  >date</tt> complained about the <tt  >-j</tt>
flag? Good. That
means you're likely using GNU <tt  >date</tt>, which is far superior and is
actually something we'll need for the full script to work. Test which
version you have by using the <tt  >--version</tt> flag:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ date --version
date (GNU coreutils) 8.4

</pre>
</p><p>
How many days were in a given year? That's also easily done with a
shortcut, checking the day of the year of December 31st. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date -d 12/31/2010 +%j
365
</pre>
</p><p>
But, 2012 was a leap year. So:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date -d 12/31/2012 +%j
366
</pre>
</p><p>
Therefore the days-left-in-year calculation is simply days-in-year &ndash;
day-of-the-year.
</p><p>
The next calculation is days/year * years between the specified date and
the current year.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x191c580.0x1a14eb0"></a>
Days Left in Year</h2></div></div><p>
The first step of calculating the days left in the starting year is to create
the correct date format string for the <tt  >date</tt> command.
Fortunately,
with GNU date, it's easily done:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# build date string format for the specified starting date
startdatefmt="$startmon/$startday/$startyear"
calculate="$(date -d "12/31/$startyear" +%j) - $(date -d 
 &#8618;$startdatefmt +%j)"
echo "Calculating $calculate"
daysleftinyear=$(( $calculate ))
</pre>
</p><p>
When run as part of the script, the debugging echo statement offers useful
information to help debug things:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh daysago.sh 2 4 2012
The date you specified -- 2-4-2012 -- is valid. Continuing...
Calculating 366 - 035
There were 337 days left in the starting year
$ sh daysago.sh 2 4 2013
The date you specified -- 2-4-2013 -- is valid. Continuing...
Calculating 365 - 035
There were 336 days left in the starting year
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that when we specified Feb 4, 2012, a leap year, there are 337 days
left in the year, but when we specify the same date on the following
non-leapyear, there are 336 days. Sounds right!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x191c580.0x1a15220"></a>
Days in Intervening Years</h2></div></div><p>
The next portion of the calculation is to calculate the number of days in
each year between the start year and the current year, not counting either
of those. Sounds like a <tt  >while</tt> loop to me, so let's
do this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
daysbetweenyears=0
tempyear=$(( $startyear + 1 ))
while [ $tempyear -lt $thisyear ] ; do
  echo "intervening year: $tempyear"
  daysbetweenyears=$(( $daysbetweenyears + $(date -d 
   &#8618;"12/31/$tempyear" +%j) ))
  tempyear=$(( $tempyear + 1 ))
done
echo "Intervening days in years between $startyear and 
 &#8618;$thisyear = $daysbetweenyears"
</pre>
</p><p>
Again, I'm adding a debugging <tt  >echo</tt> statement to clarify
what's going on, but we're getting pretty close:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh daysago.sh 2 4 2010
The date you specified -- 2-4-2010 -- is valid. Continuing...
Calculating 365 - 035
Calculated that there were 336 days left in the starting year
intervening year: 2011
intervening year: 2012
intervening year: 2013
intervening days in years between 2010 and 2014 = 1096
</pre>
</p><p>
That seems to pass the reasonable test, as there are three years between
2010 and 2014 (namely 2011, 2012 and 2013) and the back-of-envelope
calculation of 3*365 = 1095.
</p><p>
If you're using non-GNU <tt  >date</tt>, you already have realized that the string
format is different and that you need to use the <tt  >-j</tt> flag instead
of the <tt  >-d</tt> flag. The
problem is, the older <tt  >date</tt> command also works
differently, because 1969 is the beginning of Epoch time. Look:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date -j 0204120060  # last two digits are year, so '60
Wed Feb  4 12:00:00 PST 2060
</pre>
</p><p>
It interprets the two-digit &ldquo;60&rdquo; as 2060, not 1960. Boo!
</p><p>
If you're not running GNU <tt  >date</tt>, you're going to have a really
big problem for dates prior to 1969, and I'm going to just say &ldquo;get
GNU date, dude&rdquo; to solve it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x191c580.0x1a15a60"></a>
Total Days That Have Passed</h2></div></div><p>
We have everything we need to do the math now. We can calculate the number
of days left in the start year, the number of days in intervening years,
and the day-of-year number of the current date. Let's put it all
together:


<pre     class="programlisting">
###   DAYS IN CURRENT YEAR
dayofyear=$(date +%j)              # that's easy!
###   NOW LET'S ADD IT ALL UP
totaldays=$(( $daysleftinyear + $daysbetweenyears + $dayofyear ))
echo "$totaldays days have elapsed between 
 &#8618;$startmon/$startday/$startyear and today, 
 &#8618;day $dayofyear of $thisyear."
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it. Now, stripping out the debug echo statements, here's
what we can ascertain:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh daysago.sh 2 4 1949
23900 days have elapsed between 2/4/1949 and today, 
 &#8618;day 188 of 2014.
$ sh daysago.sh 2 4 1998
6003 days have elapsed between 2/4/1998 and today, 
 &#8618;day 188 of 2014.
$ sh daysago.sh 2 4 2013
524 days have elapsed between 2/4/2013 and today, 
 &#8618;day 188 of 2014.
</pre>
</p><p>
But look, there's still a lurking problem when it's the same year
that we're calculating:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh daysago.sh 2 4 2014
524 days have elapsed between 2/4/2014 and today, 
 &#8618;day 188 of 2014.
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a pretty easy edge case to debug, however, so I'm going to
wrap things up here and let you enjoy trying to figure out what's not
quite right in the resultant script.
