When fetchmail can't fetch mail, it's time to fall back to raw
command-line commands.

Through the years, you tend to accumulate a suite of tools, practices and
settings as you use Linux. In my case, this has meant a Mutt configuration
that fits me like a tailored suit and a screen session that at home
reconnects me to my IRC session and at work provides me with quick access
to e-mail with notifications along the bottom of the terminal for Nagios
alerts and incoming e-mail. I've written about all of these different tools
in this column through years, but in this article, I talk about how
I adapted when one of my scripts no longer worked.
</p><p>
My e-mail notification script is relatively straightforward. I configure
fetchmail on my local machine, but instead of actually grabbing e-mail, I
just run <tt  >fetchmail -c</tt>, which returns each mailbox along with how many
messages are unseen. I parse that, and if I have any unread mail, I display
it in the notification area in screen. I've written about that before in my
February 2011 Hack and / column &ldquo;Status Messages in Screen&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10950" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10950</a>), and up until
now, it has worked well for
me. Whenever I set up my computer for a new job, I just configure fetchmail
and reuse the same script. 
</p><p>
Recently, however, we switched our mail servers
at work to a central Exchange setup, which by itself wouldn't be too much of
an issue&mdash;in the past I just configured Mutt and fetchmail to treat it like
any other IMAP host&mdash;but in this case, the Exchange server was configured
with security in mind. So in addition to using IMAPS, each client was given
a client certificate to present to the server during authentication. Mutt
was able to handle this just fine with a few configuration tweaks, but
fetchmail didn't fare so well. It turns out that fetchmail has what some
would call a configuration quirk and others would call a bug. When you
configure fetchmail to use a client certificate, it overrides whatever user
name you have configured in favor of the user specified inside the client
certificate. In my case, the two didn't match, so fetchmail wasn't able to
log in to the Exchange server, and I no longer got new mail notifications
inside my screen session.
</p><p>
I put up with this for a week or so, until I realized I really missed
knowing when I had new e-mail while I was working. I decided there must be
some other way to get a count of unread messages from the command line, so I
started doing research. In the end, what worked for me was to use OpenSSL's
s_client mode to handle the SSL session between me and the Exchange server
(including the client certificate), and then once that session was
established, I was able to send raw IMAP commands to authenticate and then
check for unread messages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27da580.0x28d2720"></a>
OpenSSL s_client</h2></div></div><p>
The first step was to set up an OpenSSL s_client connection. Most people
probably interact with OpenSSL on the command line only when they need to
generate new self-signed certificates or read data from inside a
certificate, but the tool also provides an s_client mode that you can use
to troubleshoot SSL-enabled services like HTTPS. With s_client, you initiate
an SSL connection and after it outputs relevant information about that SSL
connection, you are presented with a prompt just as though you used Telnet
or Netcat to connect to a remote port. From there, you can type in raw HTTP,
SMTP or IMAP commands depending on your service.
</p><p>
The syntax for s_client is relatively straightforward, and here is how I
connected to my Exchange server over IMAPS:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ openssl s_client -cert /home/kyle/.mutt/imaps_cert.pem 
 &#8618;-crlf -connect imaps.example.com:993
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-cert</tt> argument takes a full path to my client certificate file, which I
store with the rest of my Mutt configuration. The
<tt  >-crlf</tt> option makes sure
that I send the right line feed characters each time I press
enter&mdash;important for some touchy IMAPS servers. Finally the
<tt  >-connect</tt>
argument lets me specify the hostname and port to which to connect.
</p><p>
Once you
connect, you will see a lot of SSL output, including the certificate the
server presents, and finally, you will see a prompt like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
* OK The Microsoft Exchange IMAP4 service is ready.
</pre>
</p><p>
From here, you use the <tt  >tag login</tt> IMAP command followed by your user name and
password to log in, and you should get back some sort of confirmation if
login succeeded:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tag login kyle.rankin supersecretpassword
tag OK LOGIN completed.
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that I'm logged in, I can send whatever other IMAP commands I want,
including some that would show me a list of mailboxes, e-mail headers or
even the full contents of messages. In my case though, I just want to see
the number of unseen messages in my INBOX, so I use the
<tt  >tag STATUS</tt>
command followed by the mailbox and then <tt  >(UNSEEN)</tt> to tell it to return the
number of unseen messages:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tag STATUS INBOX (UNSEEN)
* STATUS INBOX (UNSEEN 1)
tag OK STATUS completed.
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, I have one unread message in my INBOX. Now that I have that
information, I can type <tt  >tag LOGOUT</tt> to log out.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27da580.0x28d2e58"></a>
expect</h2></div></div><p>
Now this is great, except I'm not going to go through all of those steps
every time I want to check for new mail. What I need to do is automate
this. Unfortunately, my attempts just to pass the commands I wanted as input
didn't work so well, because I needed to pause between commands for the remote
server to accept the previous command. When you are in a situation like
this, a tool like expect is one of the common ways to handle it. expect
allows you to construct incredibly complicated programs that look for
certain output and then send your input. In my case, I just needed a few
simple commands: 1) confirm Exchange was ready; 2) send my login; 3) once
I was authenticated, send the <tt  >tag STATUS</tt> command; 4) then finally log out. The
expect script turned into the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set timeout 10
spawn openssl s_client -cert /home/kyle/.mutt/imaps_cert.pem 
 &#8618;-crlf -connect imaps.example.com:993
expect "* OK"
send "tag login kyle.rankin supersecretpassword\n"
expect "tag OK LOGIN completed."
sleep 1
send "tag STATUS INBOX (UNSEEN)\n"
expect "tag OK"
send "tag LOGOUT\n"
</pre>
</p><p>
I saved that to a local file (and made sure only my user could read it) and
then called it as the sole argument to expect:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ expect .imapsexpectscript
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, since this script runs through the whole IMAPS session, it also
outputs my authentication information to the screen. I need only the INBOX
status output anyway, so I just grep for that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ expect ~/.imapsexpectscript | egrep '\(UNSEEN [0-9]' 
* STATUS INBOX (UNSEEN 1)
</pre>
</p><p>
For my screen session, I just want the name of the mailbox and the number
of read messages (and no output if there are no unread messages), so I
modify my <tt  >egrep</tt> slightly and pipe the whole thing to a quick Perl
one-liner to strip output I don't want. The final script looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

MAILCOUNT=`expect ~/.imapsexpectscript | egrep '\(UNSEEN [1-9]' 
 &#8618;| perl -pe 's/.*STATUS \w+.*?(\d+)\).*?$/$1/'`
if [ "$MAILCOUNT" != "" ]; then
 echo INBOX:${MAILCOUNT}
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I can just update my .screenrc to load the output of that script into
one of my backtick fields instead of fetchmail (more on that in my previous
column about screen), and I'm back in business.
