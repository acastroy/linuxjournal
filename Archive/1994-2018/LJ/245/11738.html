What's better than a DNS server, a DHCP server and a TFTP
server? A single d&aelig;mon that does it all!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d8c580.0x1e84358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've always been a fan of putting aftermarket firmware on consumer-grade
routers. Whether it's DD-WRT, Tomato, OpenWRT or whatever your favorite
flavor of &ldquo;better than stock&rdquo; firmware might be, it just makes economic
sense. Unfortunately, my routing needs have surpassed my trusty Linksys
router. Although I could certainly buy a several-hundred-dollar, business-class router, I really don't like spending money like that. Thankfully,
I found an incredible little router (the EdgeRouter Lite) that can route
a million packets per second and has three gigabit Ethernet ports. So far,
it's an incredible router, but that's all it does&mdash;route. Which brings
me to the point of this article.
</p><p>
I've always used the DHCP and DNS server built in to DD-WRT to serve my
network. I like having those two services tied to the router, because
if every other server on my network fails, I still can get on-line. I
figure the next best thing is to have a Raspberry Pi dedicated to those
services. Because all my RPi devices currently are attached to televisions
around the house (running XBMC), I decided to enlist the Cubox computer
I reviewed in November 2013 (Figure 1). It's been sitting
on my shelf collecting dust, and I'd rather have it do something useful.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11738f1.large.jpg"><img src="11738f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Cubox is more powerful than a Raspberry Pi, but even an
RPi is more power than DNSMasq requires!
</p></div></div><p>
Although the Cubox certainly is powerful enough to run BIND and the ISC DHCP
server, that's really overkill for my network. Plus, BIND really annoys
me with its serial-number incrementation and such whenever an update is
made. It wasn't until I started to research alternate DNS servers that
I realized just how powerful DNSMasq can be. Plus, the way it works is
simplicity at its finest. First, let's look at its features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Extremely small memory and CPU footprint: I knew this was the case,
because it's the program that runs on Linux-based consumer routers where
memory and CPU are at a premium.
</p></li><li><p>
DNS server: DNSMasq approaches DNS in a different way from the
traditional BIND d&aelig;mon. It doesn't offer the complexity of domain
transfers, master/slave relationships and so on. It does offer extremely
simple and highly configurable options that are, in my opinion, far
more useful in a small- to medium-size network. It even does reverse DNS
(PTR records) automatically! (More on those details later.)
</p></li><li><p>
DHCP server: where the DNS portion of DNSMasq lacks in certain advanced
features, the DHCP services offered actually are extremely robust. Most
routers running firmware like DD-WRT don't offer a Web interface to the
advanced features DNSMasq provides, but it rivals and even surpasses
some of the standalone DHCP servers.
</p></li><li><p>
TFTP server: working in perfect tandem with the advanced features of
DHCP, DNSMasq even offers a built-in TFTP server for things like booting
thin clients or sending configuration files.
</p></li><li><p>
A single configuration file: it's possible to use multiple configuration
files, and I even recommend it for clarity's sake. In the end, however,
DNSMasq requires you to edit only a single configuration file to manage
all of its powerful services. That configuration file also is very well
commented, which makes using it much nicer.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d8c580.0x1e84b40"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
DNSMasq has been around for a very long time. Installing it on any
Linux operating system should be as simple as searching for it in your
distribution's package management system. On Debian-based systems that
would mean something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, on a Red Hat/CentOS system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
yum install dnsmasq (as root)
</pre>
</p><p>
The configuration file (there's just one!) is usually stored at
/etc/dnsmasq.conf, and like I mentioned earlier, it is very well
commented. Figuring out even the most advanced features is usually as
easy as reading the configuration file and un-commenting those directives
you want to enable. There are even examples for those directives that
require you to enter information specific to your environment.
</p><p>
After the dnsmasq package is installed, it most likely will get started
automatically. From that point on, any time you make changes to the
configuration (or make changes to the /etc/hosts file), you'll need
to restart the service or send an HUP signal to the d&aelig;mon. I recommend
using the init script to do that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo service dnsmasq restart
</pre>
</p><p>
But, if your system doesn't have the init service set up for dnsmasq,
you can issue an HUP signal by typing something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo kill -HUP $(pidof dnsmasq)
</pre>
</p><p>
This will find the PID (process ID) and send the signal to reload its
configuration files. Either way should work, but the init script will
give you more feedback if there are errors.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d8c580.0x1e84f60"></a>
First Up: DNS</h2></div></div><p>
Of all the features DNSMasq offers, I find its DNS services to be the most
useful and awesome. You get the full functionality of your upstream DNS
server (usually provided by your ISP), while seamlessly integrating DNS
records for you own network. To accomplish that &ldquo;split DNS&rdquo;-type setup
with BIND, you need to create a fake DNS master file, and even then you
run into problems if you are missing a DNS name in your local master file,
because BIND won't query another server by default for records it thinks
it's in charge of serving. DNSMasq, on the other hand, follows a very
simple procedure when it receives a request. Figure 2 shows that process.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11738f2.large.jpg"><img src="11738f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. DNSMasq makes DNS queries simple, flexible and highly configurable.
</p></div></div><p>
For my purposes, this means I can put a single entry into my server's
/etc/hosts file for something like &ldquo;server.brainofshawn.com&rdquo;, and
DNSMasq will return the IP address in the /etc/hosts file. If a host
queries DNSMask for an entry not in the server's /etc/hosts file,
www.brainofshawn.com for instance, it will query the upstream DNS server
and return the live IP for my Web host. DNSMasq makes a split DNS scenario
extremely easy to maintain, and because it uses the server's /etc/hosts
file, it's simple to modify entries.
</p><p>
My personal favorite feature of DNSMasq's DNS service, however, is that it
supports round-robin load balancing. This isn't something that normally
works with an /etc/hosts file entry, but with DNSMasq, it does. Say you
have two entries in your /etc/hosts file like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
192.168.1.10	webserver.example.com
192.168.1.11	webserver.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
On a regular system (that is, if you put it in your client's /etc/hosts
file), the DNS query always will return 192.168.1.10 first. DNSMasq,
on the other hand, will see those two entries and mix up their order
every time it's queried. So instead of 192.168.1.10 being the first IP,
half of the time, it will return 192.168.1.11 as the first IP. It's a
very rudimentary form of load balancing, but it's a feature most people
don't know exists!
</p><p>
Finally, DNSMasq automatically will create and serve reverse DNS responses
based on entries found in the server's /etc/hosts file. In the previous
example, running the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dig -x 192.168.1.10
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d8c580.0x1e854e0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
would get the response &ldquo;webserver.example.com&rdquo; as the reverse DNS
lookup. If you have multiple DNS entries for a single IP address, DNSMasq
uses the first entry as the reverse DNS response. So if you have a line
like this in your server's /etc/hosts file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
192.168.1.15 www.example.com mail.example.com ftp.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
Any regular DNS queries for www.example.com, mail.example.com or
ftp.example.com will get answered with &ldquo;192.168.1.15&rdquo;, but a reverse
DNS lookup on 192.168.1.15 will get the single response
&ldquo;www.example.com&rdquo;.
</p><p>
DNSMasq is so flexible and feature-rich, it's hard to find a reason
not to use it. Sure, there are valid reasons for using a more robust DNS
server like BIND, but for most small to medium networks, DNSMasq is far
more appropriate and much, much simpler.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d8c580.0x1e858a8"></a>
Serving DHCP</h2></div></div><p>
It's possible to use DNSMasq for DNS only and disable the DHCP services
it offers. Much like DNS, however, the simplicity and power offered
by DNSMasq makes it a perfect candidate for small- to medium-sized
networks. It supports both dynamic ranges for automatic IP assignment
and static reservations based on the MAC address of computers on your
network. Plus, since it also acts as the DNS server for your network, it
has a really great hostname-DNS integration for computers connected to
your network that may not have a DNS entry. How does that work? Figure
3 shows the modified method used when the DNS server receives a query
if it's also serving as a DHCP server. (The extra step is shown as the
orange-colored diamond in the flowchart.)
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11738f3.large.jpg"><img src="11738f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. If you use DHCP, it automatically integrates into your DNS
system&mdash;awesome for finding dynamically assigned IPs!
</p></div></div><p>
Basically, if your friend brings a laptop to your house and connects
to your network, when it requests a DHCP address, it tells the DNSMasq
server its hostname. From that point on, until the lease expires,
any DNS queries the server receives for that hostname will be returned
as the IP it assigned via DHCP. This is very convenient if you have a
computer connected to your network whose hostname you know, but it gets a
dynamically assigned IP address. In my house, I have a Hackintosh computer
that just gets a random IP assigned via DNSMasq's DHCP server. Figure 4
shows what happens when I ping the name &ldquo;hackintosh&rdquo; on my network. Even
though it isn't listed in any of the server's configuration files,
since it handles DHCP, it creates a DNS entry on the fly.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11738f4.large.jpg"><img src="11738f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. There are no DNS entries anywhere for my Hackintosh, but thanks
to DNSMasq, it's pingable via its hostname.
</p></div></div><p>
Static DHCP entries can be entered in the single configuration file
using this format:


<pre     class="programlisting">
dhcp-host=90:fb:a6:86:0d:60,xbmc-livingroom,192.168.1.20
dhcp-host=b8:27:eb:e3:4c:5f,xbmc-familyroom,192.168.1.21
dhcp-host=b8:27:eb:16:d9:08,xbmc-masterbedroom,192.168.1.22
dhcp-host=00:1b:a9:fa:98:a9,officelaser,192.168.1.100
dhcp-host=04:46:65:d4:e8:c9,birdcam,192.168.1.201
</pre>
</p><p>
It's also valid to leave the hostname out of the static declaration,
but adding it to the DHCP reservation adds it to the DNS server's list
of known addresses, even if the client itself doesn't tell the DHCP
server its hostname. You also could just add the hostname to your DNSMasq
server's /etc/hosts file, but I prefer to make my static DHCP entries
with hostnames, so I can tell at a glance what computer the reservation
is for.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d8c580.0x227e180"></a>
And If That's Not Enough...</h2></div></div><p>
The above scenarios are all I use DNSMasq for on my local network. It's
more incredible than any DHCP/DNS combination I've ever used before,
including the Windows and OS X server-based services I've used in large
networks. It does provide even more services, however, for those folks
needing them.
</p><p>
The TFTP server can be activated via configuration file to serve boot
files, configuration files or any other TFTP files you might need served
on your network. The service integrates flawlessly with the DHCP server
to provide boot filenames, PXE/BOOTP information, and custom DHCP
options needed for booting even the most finicky devices. Even if you
need TFTP services for a non-boot-related reason, DNSMasq's server is
just a standard TFTP service that will work for any computer or device
requiring it.
</p><p>
If you've read Kyle Rankin's recent articles on DNSSEC and want to
make sure your DNS information is secure, there's no need to install
BIND. DNSMasq supports DNSSEC, and once again provides configuration
examples in the configuration file.
</p><p>
Truly, DNSMasq is the unsung hero for consumer-grade Internet routers. It
allows those tiny devices to provide DNS and DHCP for your entire
network. If you install the program on a regular server (or teeny tiny
Raspberry Pi or Cubox), however, it can become an extremely robust
platform for all your network needs. If it weren't for my need to get
a more powerful and reliable router, I never would have learned about
just how amazing DNSMasq is. If you've ever been frustrated by BIND,
or if you'd just like to have more control over the DNS and DHCP services
on your network, I urge you to give DNSMasq a closer look. It's for more
than just your DD-WRT router!
