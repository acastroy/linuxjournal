    The audiophile will enjoy the excellent sound output; the
    typist will find the keyboard pleasurable for a device so
    tiny; and the graphics fan will be seduced by the crystal
    clear screen.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x270d580.0x2805500"></a></h2></div></div><p>After the success of the Zaurus SL-5500
and the SL-5600, which was a revamped SL-5500 featuring a faster
CPU, a better battery and a microphone, many people expected the
next Zaurus would be as innovative as the SL-5500 was when it was
first introduced. The Zaurus SL-C700 seems to satisfy this
expectation.
</p><p>The SL-C700 device is smaller than the previous ones and
feels much more polished. When I received it, my fianc&eacute;e
immediately wanted to play with it, though she hadn't found the
older ones very attractive. The SL-C700, however, comes with some
disadvantages, which easily are explained by the lack of official
support for it from Sharp outside Japan. Its range of use is quite
impaired by the lack of support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x270d580.0x2805660"></a>Specifications</h2></div></div><p>Featuring an Intel XScale PXA 250 400MHz processor, 64MB of
Flash, 32MB of RAM, a 65,536 color 640 &times; 480 VGA screen, an
IrDA port, a USB port, both a CompactFlash and a MMC-SD port, a
stereo audio jack, a jogdial-like wheel, a comfortable keyboard and
a screen that can move between the traditional computer-style
landscape mode and the traditional PDA-style language mode, this is
the most-advanced PDA currently available.</p><p>The audiophile will enjoy the excellent sound output; the
typist will find the keyboard pleasurable for a device so tiny; and
the graphics fan will be seduced by the crystal-clear screen.
Personally, I was much more impressed by the soft and luxurious
feeling of the gray case. Although the earlier devices felt a bit
like plastic toys, this one proclaims its style with its
appearance. The inclusion of LEDs on the left side of the hinge for
quick access to battery charge and e-mail status, plus a convenient
wheel with OK and Cancel buttons on the side of the machine,
showcase the user-friendly design.</p><p>One missing feature may be an included microphone. Due to the
poor quality of typical PDA microphones and the availability of
hands-free earbuds and microphones, this is not a real issue.
However, Sharp has listened to customer feedback and did not forget
to include an internal speaker. It may not seem natural to include
a speaker without also providing a microphone, but its presence
allows the SL-C700 to communicate directly to its user through
customized tones when an e-mail is received, when the device is
powered on or for alarms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x270d580.0x2805818"></a>Ordering</h2></div></div><p>The SL-C700 is officially available only in Japan.
Dynamism.com, though, sells the device worldwide for $699 US, plus
custom duties. Because it is a big success in Japan, where it is
always back-ordered, expect long delays before receiving one. It
took two months to have my order processed, and the FedEx parcel
arrived after I was no longer expecting it.</p><p>Dynamism.com hired a coder well known in the Zaurus community
to localize the whole device to English. After the default Japanese
applications had been removed, I couldn't spot a single Japanese
word except in the Favorites bookmarks. Even with full-English
support, two dangerous keys featuring Japanese letters stand
between Fn and space. If you press them, you are put into Japanese
mode. The English fonts used prevent the application from
displaying Japanese, though, so only little squares underlined in
red by the Japanese on-the-fly spell checker appear. It took me
some time to realize these keys had to be pressed again until an A
appeared in the titlebar. When in Japanese input mode, the letter A
is replaced by a Japanese character.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x270d580.0x2805978"></a>First Impressions</h2></div></div><p>The keyboard on the SL-C700 has keys that look big and soft,
but a disturbing beep accompanies every key press. The beep can be
disabled with a simple click on the audio icon on the taskbar,
which brings up the Audio Setting menu. Then, the keys emit soft
clicks with each key press, much more discreet than the loud
beep.</p><p>The quality of the SL-C700 screen is impressive; I had never
seen such a screen before. The picture is so sharp you cannot see
any individual pixels. The colors and the display are so bright you
can use the device outdoors with the backlight on. The SL-5x00
series screens were impressive&mdash;much better than the IPAQ, for
example&mdash;but could not compete with the most recent Sony
Cli&eacute; LCD screens. The SL-C700 screen outperforms the
competition and will bring disappointment to previously proud
Cli&eacute; owners.</p><p>It takes four minutes to boot the first time the SL-C700 is
powered up. During boot up, the SL-C700 told me it needed power on
a pop-up window. I found a matchbox-sized charger in the box, with
a Japanese/American plug. With a plug adapter, it worked like a
charm in the European 230V output, even if it was labeled as only
100V. Dynamism.com comments that no power adapter is needed. The
small size of the charger is a big plus; it makes the short battery
life, around three hours, less important because it can be carried
everywhere.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x270d580.0x2805b30"></a>Logging In</h2></div></div><p>When the boot is finally over, the setup screen welcomes you.
After calibrating the screen sensors with five clicks, you must
enter the local date, time and time zone. New York is included by
default, along with Tokyo and other important cities.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6654f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The launcher features big icons.
</p></div></div><p>Next, the default launcher pops up. Many applications are
installed by default. I tried the personal information manager
(PIM) first. I was disappointed by the small font used in the
datebook and address book until I realized this font is used in
every other application. Comparing the screen in front of me to the
Japanese user manual screenshots, I realized it was smaller than
what it should have been. An e-mail to Dynamism.com technical
support confirmed that the English localization of the device had
the unexpected side effect of implementing a different font by
default. It has been reported to Dynamism.com, so the devices now
should ship with a normal font.</p><p>Another problem is the strange alphabetical ordering in the
address book&mdash;A, Ka, Sa and so on. This is Japanese alphabetical
order, which is not exactly suited for English speakers. Another
problem is the lack of XML support for former SL-5x00 owners.
Someone at Sharp must have had the clever idea of removing the
industry-standard XML format in favor of an obscure binary data
format, where data is stored in ~/Applications/dtm with strange
names. Personally, I liked the old ~/Applications/Datebook and
~/Applications/Addressbook, with XML files that could be imported
or exported into other applications easily.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6654f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The datebook is not too handy.
</p></div></div><p>I installed the original SL-5x00 Addressbook, which required
only putting the addressbook.xml file in
~/Applications/Addressbook. For some reason, the SL-5x00 series
datebook is not compatible with the SL-C700&mdash;it displays only a
line instead of the meetings scheduled. So I decided to go with
Korganiser embedded, which uses the same format of the
award-winning desktop software. I simply put the addressbook.xml
file and the calendar on a CompactFlash card and copied them to the
Zaurus.</p><p>Even with my best efforts over several days of attempts
augmented by forum support, I did not come close to having the
Zaurus syncing to either Windows or Linux. The desktop setup is a
mystical adventure I may try again when I have more time or when an
English user manual is available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x270d580.0x2806108"></a>The Office Suite</h2></div></div><p>HancomWord and HancomSheet, the Zaurus' word processor and
spreadsheet, were interesting on the SL-5x00. They have matured
into fast, easy-to-use and professional software on the SL-C700,
able to read and save Microsoft files without any problem. Although
the import may be slow sometimes, having the documents available
everywhere is a pleasure.</p><p>The big 640 &times; 480 screen of the SL-C700 provides a true
interface to the user. The screen rotation between 640 &times; 480
landscape mode and 480 &times; 640 portrait mode is supported
perfectly. It also enables an editing session to take advantage of
the wider screen and the keyboard, as well as a quick visualization
of the data using a taller display and a simple press of the
wheel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x270d580.0x2806268"></a>Getting on the Net</h2></div></div><p>Configuring the internet connection is a kid's game. Being
the lucky owner of a home wireless network, I had only to go to the
network setting application, give a title to my connection, type my
encryption key and select auto (dhcp) mode, a mode where IP
addresses are assigned automatically. Plugging in a wireless
CompactFlash card presented a globe-like icon with a big red cross
on it. Clicking this icon showed me a list of available
connections, where I chose the wireless connection I had set up and
was connected. The list of connections means the SL-C700 is able to
move from one network to another without any trouble&mdash;a necessary
feature for a mobility device.</p><p>Both the Netfront browser and the Qtopia mail client are
present on the SL-C700. They once again outperform their SL-5x00
equivalents. Although the Opera browser was not able to display
every web site on the tiny SL-5x00 screen, Netfront is perfectly
compatible with every web site I tried.</p><p>If the text is too small or too large, the Fn-3 and Fn-4
shortcuts allow the user to resize the display dynamically. The
Fn-1 and Fn-2 shortcuts complete this customization with a
brightness increase or decrease, which is useful when the ambient
light changes.</p><p>Tabs allow multiple web sites to be opened at the same time.
The browser is easy to use with self-evident menu items and icons
and few configurable options. This ease is welcome as the only user
manual is in Japanese.</p><p>The e-mail application also is easy to configure and use. I
had to type only my POP server, user name, password and outgoing
mail server to receive e-mail on the Zaurus. I immediately was able
to reply off-line. Mails too big to be stored reasonably are not
downloaded. It still is possible to retrieve them, but each message
requires manual confirmation. Once again this is a useful feature
to prevent the PDA memory from becoming full of junk mail and
useless attachments.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6654f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Excellent e-mail support is a big plus for the SL-C700.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x270d580.0x2806688"></a>The Multimedia Suite</h2></div></div><p>Both an audio player and a video player are present on the
SL-C700. They are completed by a picture viewer and an audio
recorder. The audio player plays MP3 files perfectly, keeping a
playlist for the user. The sound output is excellent, and the user
interface for the audio player is intuitive. A volume control and a
randomize function allow the SL-C700 to be used as a digital
jukebox. The audio player is completed by a clever display-off
button that turns off the whole screen, saving battery usage to
prolong the musical experience.</p><p>In the case of the picture viewer, a list of the digital
pictures I had on my CompactFlash card was presented with
thumbnails. I could then click on each thumbnail to see the
pictures individually or start a slideshow to use the SL-C700 as a
digital picture viewer. My fianc&eacute;e was impressed by the
quality of the pictures we took on New Year's Eve on such a small
display. They were crisp and bright, with such beautiful colors it
was hard to believe we were viewing them on a PDA.</p><p>I do not like carrying a laptop with me when I am traveling,
which can be annoying when the on-flight movie is bad. But next
time I take a long flight, I will not envy the big, portable DVD
player the person sitting next to me has. Saving a DivX file to a
256MB CompactFlash disk, then watching it on my PDA, however,
certainly will make my flight neighbor jealous. Thanks to the
Doctor Z video player, it is possible to enjoy a high-quality
playback without frame drop if the movie has been recoded with some
settings regarding the supported DivX codec, the SL-C700 screen and
supported frame rate.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x270d580.0x2806840"></a>Java</h2></div></div><p>Another interesting feature of the SL-C700 is the complete
Java support. I always am looking for more knowledge of the sky and
galaxies, so sky maps are the first applications I install. I went
to the Solun web site at
<a href="http://www.piecafe.demon.co.uk" target="_self">www.piecafe.demon.co.uk</a>
and downloaded the Java version, designed for the SL-5500. It
worked like a charm on the SL-C700, after some minor tweaks to use
the 640 &times; 480 resolution. The high resolution allows
comfortable use, even if the lack of memory quickly reminds you the
SL-C700 is not perfect.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6654f4.large.jpg"><img src="6654f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Java applications take advantage of the
big screen.</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x270d580.0x2806bb0"></a>Drawbacks</h2></div></div><p>After the honeymoon with the new toy, I realized the SL-C700
was not without fault. The first problem is the resolution
tweaking. Although using a different processor from the one the
SL-5x00 uses, every SL-5x00 application should work fine on the
SL-C700. However, some have been coded using fixed-screen sizes,
which cause them not to scale well on a bigger display. To avoid
this problem, Sharp introduced a low resolution (240 &times; 320)
portrait mode to emulate the SL-5x00 screen better. It is active by
default, however, and the transition between high resolution and
low resolution takes four seconds, which seems like forever if you
need the application at that moment.</p><p>The Doctor Z video player works fine and officially is
SL-C700-compatible. The SL-C700 also comes with excellent e-mail
support. I tried the free SL-5x00 applications, and most of them
work fine even if the high resolution mode is selected. It takes
only a long click on the application icon then
selecting/deselecting the run-in compatibility mode icon to give it
a try.</p><p>Another annoying problem is the lack of memory. 64MB of Flash
means 64MB of storage space, where 30MB are left for the user.
Although 32MB may seem a lot for a PDA, Qtopia is memory hungry,
which does not leave a lot for the user. When I run the audio
player and a command line, only 600K are left. Even worse, only 4MB
of memory are free after a clean boot up, which means there is
little room left for the applications to run. I had many errors due
to the lack of available memory when using Java applications. The
device became sluggish until a screen suddenly appeared and asked
me to stop some applications.</p><p>A serious problem my unit had was the SD port; for some
reason, inserting an SD card resulted in a complete lock until the
card was removed, when the traditional four-minute reboot takes
over. I had to send it back to Dynamism.com.</p><p>I also could not find any cases or accessories for the
SL-C700. In Japan, some accessories are starting to be made
available, but it is hard to order them on-line when you do not
speak Japanese.</p><p>I must admit that even with these problems, I miss my
SL-C700. The default PIM suite is not really usable, but the
multimedia suite, the office suite and the internet suite were more
than what I needed to be happy with my PDA. Most of the problems I
experienced are explained easily by the lack of official support in
English. The lack of XML support and SL-5x00 backward compatibility
in the PIM is a bigger issue, because it certainly cannot be solved
by official support.</p><p>With some help found on the SL-C700 forums on
<a href="http://externe.net/zaurus/forum" target="_self">externe.net/zaurus/forum</a>,
I will start using the SL-C700 on a daily basis when it comes back.
It will completely replace my former PDA, the Zaurus SL-5500, when
I can run a good PIM suite that syncs to the desktop
computer.</p><p><a href="6654s1.html" target="_self">Product Information</a></p></div></div>
