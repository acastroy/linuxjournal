Detection in Embedded Systems&rdquo;, <i  >LJ</i>, September
2002, available at
<a href="../101/6059.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6059</a>]
discussed the detection of memory leaks when using C as the
programming language. This article discusses the problem of
detecting memory leaks in C++ programs. The tools discussed here
detect application program errors, not kernel memory leaks. All of
these tools have been used with the MontaVista Linux Professional
Edition 2.1 and 3.0 products, and one of them, dmalloc, ships with
MontaVista Linux.
</p><p>When developing application programs for embedded systems,
designers and programmers must take great care with using system
memory resources. Unlike workstations, embedded systems have a
finite memory source. Typically, no swap area is available to idle
programs. When the system uses up all of its resources, nothing is
left to do but panic and start over or kill some programs to make
room for the needed resources. Therefore, it is important to write
programs that do not leak memory. Many tools aid programmers in
finding these resource leaks. All of the tools discussed here come
with their own test programs.</p><p>One method of testing, which I have seen used successfully by
application developers, involves using a workstation to develop
prototype code and debugging as much as possible on it. Using
memory leak tools in this manner is strongly advised. By debugging
on a workstation, the application programmer can be assured that
the transition to the target processor will be easier. A major
reason for using workstations is they are cheap, and everybody
involved has one. Targets, on the other hand, are usually few and
in great demand.</p><p>Most memory leak detection programs are available as full
source. They typically have been built on an x86-based platform.
Running them on non-x86 targets requires some porting. This porting
effort could be as simple as a recompile, link and run, or it could
require changing some assembler code from one platform to another.
Some of the tools come with hints and suggestions for use in
cross-compiling environments.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fe580.0x12f67c0"></a>dmalloc</h2></div></div><p>The author of dmalloc, a tool I covered in detail in the
September 2002 article, states that his knowledge of C++ is
limited, and thus the C++ detection of memory leaks also is
limited. In order to use dmalloc with C++ and threads, it has been
necessary to link the application as static.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fe580.0x12f68c8"></a>ccmalloc</h2></div></div><p>The ccmalloc tool is a memory profiler with a simple usage
model that supports dynamically linked libraries but not dlopen. It
detects memory leaks, multiple de-allocation of the same data,
underwrites and overwrites and writes to already de-allocated data.
It displays allocation and de-allocation statistics. It is
applicable to optimized and stripped code and supports C++. It also
provides file and line number information for the whole call chain,
not only for the immediate caller of malloc/free, and it supports
C++. No recompilation is needed to use ccmalloc; simply link it
with <b  >-lccmalloc -ldl</b> or <b  >ccmalloc.o
-ldl</b>. ccmalloc provides efficient representation of call
chains, customizable printing of call chains, selective printing of
call chains, a compressed log file and a startup file called
.ccmalloc. The major documentation is found in a file named
ccmalloc.cfg. The test files included with the program provide more
documentation. nm and gdb are required to get information about
symbols and gzip or to compress log files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fe580.0x12f6a80"></a>NJAMD</h2></div></div><p>NJAMD is, as the author states, &ldquo;not just another malloc
debugger&rdquo;. As with most memory allocation debuggers, the standard
allocation functions are replaced with new ones that perform
various checks as memory is used. Specifically, it looks for
dynamic buffer over/underflows and detects memory reuse after it is
freed. The library built for NJAMD can be LD_PRELOADed, or it can
be linked to the program. It creates a large memory buffer on the
first memory allocation, 20MB, and it then carves this up as the
program needs memory.</p><p>NJAMD can be used alone, with a front end or from within gdb.
It has a utility that allows postmortem heap analysis. Another
feature allows the application being debugged to skip
recompilation; simply preload the library. NJAMD also is capable of
tracing leaks in library functions that wrap malloc and free, GUI
widget allocators and C++ new and delete. Often a memory leak is
not discovered immediately but lurks, waiting to strike at the most
visible moment. Tracking this down can take a long time. NJAMD has
many environment variables that allow setting varying levels of
detection. As with most debugging tools, performance can be an
issue with NJAMD, so the tool should be used only during
development. Deploying with the tool enabled can result in slower
systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fe580.0x12f6be0"></a>YAMD</h2></div></div><p>YAMD (yet another memory debugger) is another package for
trapping the boundaries of allocated blocks of memory. It does this
by using the paging mechanism of the processor. Read and write
out-of-bound conditions are detected. The detection of the error
occurs on the instruction that caused it to happen rather than
later, when other accesses occur. The traps are logged with the
filename and line number with trace-back information. The trace
back is useful because most memory allocation is done through a
limited number of routines.</p><p>The library emulates the malloc and free calls. Doing this
catches many indirect malloc calls, such as those made by strdup.
It also catches new and delete actions. If the new and delete
operators are overloaded, however, they cannot be caught.</p><p>YAMD, like other programs of its type, needs a large amount
of virtual memory or swap available to perform its magic. On an
embedded system, though, this is typically not available. The
earlier suggestion to use this tool on a workstation to do
prototype debugging is encouraged here as well. When this debug is
done, moving the application to the target can proceed with
confidence that most, if not all, memory leaks have been
found.</p><p>YAMD provides a script, run-yamd, that is used to make the
program execute easily. It offers several options to try to recover
from certain conditions. A log file can be created when the program
being checked performs a core dump. A debugger can be used to debug
YAMD-controlled programs. However, problems can arise using a
debugger when YAMD is preloaded rather than statically linked with
the program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fe580.0x12f6df0"></a>Valgrind</h2></div></div><p>Valgrind is a relatively new open-source memory debugger for
x86-GNU Linux systems. It has more capabilities than earlier tools,
but it runs only on x86 hosts. When a program is run under the
control of Valgrind, all read and writes to memory, as well as
calls to malloc, free, new and delete, are checked. Valgrind can
detect uninitialized memory, memory leaks, passing of uninitialized
or unaddressable memory, some misuse of POSIX threads and
mismatched use of malloc/free and new/delete actions.</p><p>Valgrind also can be used with gdb to catch errors and allow
the programmer to use gdb at the point of error. When doing this,
the programmer can look for the source of the problem and fix it
much sooner. In some cases, a patch can be made and debugging can
continue. Valgrind was designed to work on large as well as small
applications, including KDE 3, Mozilla, OpenOffice and
others.</p><p>One feature of Valgrind is its ability to provide details
about cache profiling. It can create a detailed simulation of the
CPU's L1-D, L1-I and unified L2 cache, and it calculates a cache
hit count for every line of the program being traced. Valgrind has
a well-written HOWTO with plenty of examples. Its web site contains
a lot of information and is easily traversed. Many different
combinations of options are available, and it is left to users to
determine their favorite combinations.</p><p>Valgrind's error display contains the process ID for the
program being examined, followed by the description of the error.
Addresses are displayed along with line numbers and source
filenames. A complete backtrace also is displayed. Valgrind reads a
startup file, which can contain instructions to suppress certain
error-checking messages. This allows you to focus more on the code
at hand rather than pre-existing libraries that cannot be
changed.</p><p>Valgrind does its checking by running the application in a
simulated processor environment. It forces the dynamic
linker/loader to load the simulator first, then loads the program
and its libraries into the simulator. All the data is collected
while the program is running. When the program terminates, all the
log data is either displayed or written to log files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fe580.0x12f7058"></a>mpatrol</h2></div></div><p>The mpatrol library can be linked with your program to trace
and track memory allocations. It was written and runs on several
different operating system platforms. One distinct advantage of the
library is it has been ported to many different target processors,
including MIPS, PowerPC, x86 and by some MontaVista customers, to
StrongARM targets.</p><p>mpatrol is highly configurable; instead of using the heap, it
can be set to allocate memory from a fixed-size static array. It
can be built as a static, shared or threadsafe library. It also can
be one large object file so it can be linked to the application
instead of contained in a library. This functionality provides a
great deal of flexibility for the end user.</p><p>The code it creates contains replacements for 44 different
memory allocation and string functions. Hooks are provided so these
routines can be called from within gdb. This allows for debugging
of programs that use mpatrol.</p><p>Library settings and heap usage can be displayed periodically
as the program runs. All the statistics gathered during runtime are
displayed at program termination. The program has built-in defaults
that can be overridden by environment variables. By changing these
environment variables at runtime, it becomes unnecessary to rebuild
the library. Tuning of the various tests can be done dynamically.
All logging is done to files in the current working directory;
these can be overridden to go to stdout and stderr or to other
files.</p><p>As the program is running, call stack trace-back information
can be gathered and logged. If the program and associated libraries
are built with debug information about symbols and line numbers,
this information can be displayed in the log file.</p><p>If at some point the programmer wants to simulate a stress
test on a smaller memory footprint, mpatrol can be instructed to
limit the memory footprint. This allows for testing conditions that
may not be readily available in the lab environment. Stress testing
in emulating a customer environment or setting up a harsh test
harness is made easier with this feature. In addition, the test
program can be made to fail a random set of memory allocations to
test error-recovery routines. This ability can be useful for
exception handling in C++. Snapshots of the heap can be taken to
allow the measuring of high and low watermarks of memory
use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fe580.0x12f7318"></a>Insure++</h2></div></div><p>The Insure++ product by Parasoft is not GPLed or free
software, but it is a good tool for memory leak detection and code
coverage, very similar to mpatrol. Insure++ does do more than
mpatrol in the area of code coverage and provides tools that
collect and display data. Trial copies of the software can be
downloaded and tried for a specified time period on non-Linux
workstations.</p><p>The product installs easily under Linux but is node-locked to
the computer on which it is installed. Insure++ comes with a
comprehensive set of documentation and several options. The code
coverage tool is separate but comes with the initial
package.</p><p>Insure++ provides a lot of information about the problems it
finds. To use Insure++, it is necessary to compile it with the
Insure++ front end, which passes it to the normal compiler. This
front end instruments the code to use the Insure++ library
routines. During the compiler phase, illegal typecasts are detected
as well as incorrect parameter passing. Obvious memory corruption
errors are reported. During runtime, errors are reported to stderr
but can be displayed by a graphical tool. When building an
application, either the command line or makefiles can be used,
facilitating the building of projects and large
applications.</p><p>Execution of the program is simple. Insure++ does not require
any special commands to execute; the program is run as if it were a
normal program. All the debug and error-trapping code is contained
in the Insure++ libraries that were linked with the program.</p><p>An add-on tool, called Inuse, displays in real time how the
program uses memory. It can give an accurate picture of how memory
is used, how fragmented it gets and subtle leaks that seem small
but could add up over time. I had an experience with a client who
found that a particular C++ class was leaking a small amount of
memory that, on a workstation, was seen to be quite small. For an
embedded system that was expected to be running for months and
possibly years, the leak could become quite large. With this tool,
the leak was easily traced, found and fixed. Other available tools
did not catch this leak.</p><p>Code coverage is analyzed by another tool, TCA. As the
program is run with Insure++ turned on, data can be collected that,
when analyzed by TCA, paints an accurate picture of what code was
executed. TCA has a GUI that enhances the display of code
coverage.</p><p><a href="6556s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
