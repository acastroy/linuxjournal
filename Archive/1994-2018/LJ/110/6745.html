    We sometimes may give newbies a hard time, but not everyone
    can know everything.

do-it-yourself tenet of the open-source philosophy. Closely linked
to that one is this month's topic of discussion, advice. One of the
best aspects of the community is the willingness to share
experiences with one another, which can be especially gratifying if
you are undertaking a new project. Without a doubt, one of the most
popular article types on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web
site&mdash;both most-read and most-submitted&mdash;is the how-to article.
</p><p>Early in 2003, Jay Docherty began a series of articles
detailing the steps to take when one decides to install Linux on a
laptop. Indeed, if you want to run Linux on a Dell or Compaq or
other major-vendor laptop, you're going to have to put it there
yourself. His first article, &ldquo;Advice for Buying a Linux-Compatible
Laptop&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6684.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6684</a>),
offers some points to consider when you're buying a new laptop on
which you want to install Linux. In part 2, &ldquo;Setting Up a Base
Linux Install on a Laptop&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6742.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6742</a>),
Jay explains how to install Debian Sid and compile a custom kernel
for your installation.</p><p>Alternatively, if you want to have a full Linux workstation
but can't and don't want to spend a bundle, take a look at Glenn
Stone's article, &ldquo;Roll Your Own $450 Linux Box&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6668.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6668</a>).
From the case to the video card to the CD-RW drive, Glenn offers
suggestions for quality inexpensive hardware that will build a
budget version of the Ultimate Linux Box. Of course, our readers
had comments and advice of their own, so be sure to catch their
postings at the end of the article.</p><p>Our most popular article so far this year has been Greg
Kroah-Hartman's &ldquo;Time for Users to Start Testing 2.5&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6740.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6740</a>),
in which Greg asks you, our readers, to help him and the rest of
the kernel team test the development kernel. The comments quickly
blossomed with questions and advice on how to get 2.5 working, so
look for more testing and bug reporting help on the site as 2.6
draws closer.</p><p>Our web site maintains all of its articles, new and old; so
if you do a little exploring, you might come across an article
outlining the process of &ldquo;Setting Up a VPN Gateway&rdquo;
(<a href="../093/4772.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4772</a>).
Duncan Napier explains how to &ldquo;install and run an IPSec-based VPN
gateway with a firewall using a single bootable Linux diskette
distribution&rdquo;. If you'd like to set up a secure internet
connection between your home system and your work LAN, this one
should help you do exactly that.</p><p>If you have some project advice or experience you would like
to share with others, perhaps saving them a few missteps along the
way, send your ideas to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. New
articles are posted on the web site every day.</p></div></div>
