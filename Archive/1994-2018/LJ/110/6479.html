    Go from a sketch to a rendered scene in a matter of hours.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f7580.0x28ef608"></a></h2></div></div><p>When I wanted to design a log home on my
computer to see what it would look like under actual lighting
conditions, I tried AutoCAD, 3D Studio Max and numerous
off-the-shelf home design packages. None of them provided the
realistic output or easy support for dealing with the log walls I
desired. I had been playing with a lighting simulation package from
the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBL) known as Radiance
and decided I could get what I wanted much faster by adding
utilities to it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f7580.0x28ef710"></a>So What Is Radiance?</h2></div></div><p>Radiance is a physical lighting simulation system written
primarily by Greg Ward Larson. It has been around since the early
1990s and recently changed licensing from a
free-for-noncommercial-use license to the open-source model. The
package produces great-looking images that are output in a special
format that records both the texture and physical lighting of a
scene, much like the professional products LightScape and VIZ 4 by
Autodesk.</p><p>The packages used for movie and game making are really the
graphics equivalent of junk food factories. The end result may be
attractive and popular, but it isn't substantial. The physical
details of lighting simply aren't as important as speed to movie
and game makers, because they have a lot of pixels to push. A
two-hour movie has 172,800 individual frames, and games have to run
in real time. As a result, light becomes an artifact of an artistic
algorithm in most graphics systems and has little basis in
reality.</p><p>Radiance output is considered a lab-quality simulation of the
physics of light (as long as your input is realistic) and has been
rigorously tested in the professional world.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f7580.0x28ef8c8"></a>Installing Radiance</h2></div></div><p>You can obtain the Radiance source code from
<a href="http://radsite.lbl.gov" target="_self">radsite.lbl.gov</a>. I
recommend getting the source tarball, as the compiled RPMs do not
include any of the auxiliary files. Once you have the
tarball:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar xzf rad3R4.tar.gz
$ cd ray
$ ./makeall install
</pre><p>Then, simply answer the questions about where you want to put
the software. I use $HOME/radiance/bin for the binaries and
$HOME/radiance/lib for the auxiliaries.
</p><p>The makeall script doesn't install the sample scenes or the
documentation, so you have to move those files to a good spot also.
For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mv doc/man $HOME/radiance
$ mv obj $HOME/radiance
</pre><p>Be sure to add these things to the MANPATH and PATH variables
in your profile. One caveat: there is an important utility called
rview in the package. Unfortunately, Vim also has a utility of the
same name, so use a PATH modification or rename Vim's rview. Do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> rename the Radiance utility, because it is
called indirectly by other Radiance utilities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f7580.0x28efc38"></a>Radiance Input Basics</h2></div></div><p>New users of Radiance first will notice the lack of an
included CAD system for generating the scene description. The
package was written for research purposes under UNIX in the early
1990s, and if you look at the file formats, it is obvious they were
written for command-line junkies like myself who love the power of
pipes and plain-text processing (my own initials are AWK, after
all).</p><p>Nevertheless, there are utilities for translating geometry
from formats like DXF, Wavefront and MGF so you can use any utility
that will output such a format. Many of the modelers listed in the
application archive of
<a href="http://www.linux.org" target="_self">linux.org</a> will output one
of these. A Windows-based AutoCAD/Radiance module called Desktop
Radiance is also available from the Radiance web site if you happen
to own a compatible version of AutoCAD.</p><p>The input files of Radiance are human readable, which makes
them good candidates for script generation. However, be warned:
occasional terms in the documentation will cause accelerated heart
rates in passing physicists, such as &ldquo;watt per square meter per
steradian&rdquo;. Be sure to check out all the documentation on the web
site. If you decide to do more than play, you might want to track
down a copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rendering With Radiance</em></span> by Greg
Ward Larson, et al. It is currently out of print, so check with
used book dealers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f7580.0x28efea0"></a>Rolling Your Own&mdash;A Sample Scene</h2></div></div><p>Listing 1 is a scene that includes sky and ground, the
material for brass and a sphere with the brass material applied.
The sky and ground are standard. The only thing you need to edit
for your own scenes are the options to gensky. The values in the
listing correspond to noon on November 25 at 33&deg; latitude north
and 80&deg; longitude west. Use negative numbers for south and
east.</p><p><a href="6479l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Sample Input Scene for
Radiance</a></p><p>Each item in the scene description has the same format. The
first line declares an existing material that will be applied to
the entry (or void if that doesn't apply), a type name for a
material or geometric primitive (like sphere, polygon, plastic or
metal) and a user-defined name. The next three groups are the
string, integer and real (floating point) parameters for the entry.
Each of these starts with an argument count, followed by the actual
arguments. They can be spread over as many lines as
necessary.</p><p>Most entries have only real parameters. This explains the two
zeros in the middle of most of the entries; they have no string or
integer parameters. The 5 in the last line of brass indicates five
real parameters, and the 4 in the last line of the sphere indicates
four real parameters. The parameters are straightforward. For
example, a sphere needs a center (x, y, z) and a radius.</p><p>Materials can be the hardest part of a scene. It is easiest
to start by copying existing materials and modifying them to your
needs. Read refman.pdf from the web site for more details.</p><p>The gensky line at the top of Listing 1 is an embedded
command-line utility. Placing an exclamation point at the beginning
of a line in a Radiance scene tells the system to run the line as a
shell command and use the output as part of the scene. Radiance
comes with a number of these utilities, and I've found that writing
your own can make scene generation quick and easy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f7580.0x28f01b8"></a>Moving Stuff Around</h2></div></div><p>Most of the generators put the object at the origin, which
isn't likely to be the spot you wanted. The xform utility addresses
this issue. Its syntax is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xform -t <span   class="emphasis"><em>transx transy transz</em></span> -rx <span   class="emphasis"><em>angle</em></span>\
      -ry
      -s <span   class="emphasis"><em>scalefactor</em></span> optional_scenefile
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>xform</b></span> can transform
everything in a file, or you can pipe the output of a generator
utility to it. It can scale the objects (<b  >-s
<i><tt>factor</tt></i></b>), rotate around an axis
(<b  >-ry <i><tt>angle</tt></i></b> means
rotate around y axis) and translate to new positions (<b  >-t
<i><tt>x y z</tt></i></b> means translate by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x y z</em></span>). You can use the different options
multiple times, in any order. The operations are done in the order
that they appear on the command line. Also, be sure to pay
attention to the exact default position used by a generator. Most
of them put a corner at the origin.
</p><p>Figure 1 shows the effects of xform on a set of cubes
generated by genbox. In this image, the viewer is on the +z axis
looking back toward the origin. The red axis is +x, and green is
+y.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6479f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Behavior of xform. The axes are color-coded: +x = red, +y
= green and +z = blue. The blue box was not transformed. The red
box was rotated, then translated. The green box was translated,
then rotated.
</p></div></div><p>The blue box is the unmodified output of a call to genbox.
The red box is the same genbox with an xform:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
!genbox redplastic box1 .5 .5 .5 \
    | xform -rz 45 -t 2 0 0
</pre><p>The green box is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
!genbox greenplastic box2 .5 .5 .5 \
    | xform -t 2 0 0 -rz 45
</pre>


The materials (like redplastic) were defined right before these
calls but are not shown in the listings. You can see the way the
order of parameters affects the operations and, thus, the output.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f7580.0x28f0aa8"></a>More Complex Scenes</h2></div></div><p>I've written a number of generators in Perl that can be used
to put together log cabins and log homes (available
electronically). In this article I use genlogwall, genlog and
genroof. All of these output in units of inches, even though they
sometimes take arguments in feet as input for convenience. The
materials I use also are included in the electronic
distribution.</p><p>The genlog utility generates a capped cylinder, centered
along the +x axis (Figure 2). It requires several
parameters:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
genlog <span   class="emphasis"><em>material name length_ft diam_inches</em></span>
</pre><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6479f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Unmodified output from genlog. Axes are in RGB/xyz order
(R = +x, G = +y and B = +z). The x-axis is inside of the log.
</p></div></div><p>The <b  ><i><tt>material</tt></i></b>
should be predefined in your scene, and
<b  ><i><tt>name</tt></i></b> should be
something you make up. The predefined materials file I supply has
three wood materials, oriented for proper-looking logs: xpine,
ypine and zpine. You should choose the material that matches your
eventual alignment for the log.</p><p>If you wanted to make a ten-feet tall, eight-inch diameter
pole pointed in +z, with its base at (15ft, 0ft, 0ft), you'd do
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
!genlog zpine mypole 10 8 | xform -ry 90 -t 180 0 0
</pre><p>Remember to use the correct units for xform: 180 inches is 15
feet.
</p><p>The utility genlogwall takes the following form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
genlogwall <span   class="emphasis"><em>material name length_ft height_ft</em></span> \
           <span   class="emphasis"><em>logdiam_inches</em></span> [<span   class="emphasis"><em>hole_data_file</em></span>]
</pre><p>The optional parameter is a data file that indicates what
holes should be in the wall and what should be in each hole, such
as a window or door. At this point, it will help if we work from
the floor plan in Figure 3.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6479f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A floor plan for a cabin. Measurements for the holes are
taken from the endpoints of the wall in which they appear.
</p></div></div>

</p><p>There are four walls, each 15 feet long. I chose the
southwest corner of the cabin to be (0,0,0), increasing x to the
east, increasing y to the north and increasing z up. This
orientation faces the building south, according to the
standard-generated sky from gensky. genlogwall always places the
generated wall at (0,0,0) along the x axis, as shown in Figure
4.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6479f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Nontransformed wall output from genlogwall. The axes'
colors are in RGB/xyz order.
</p></div></div><p>The hole data file is simple. One hole description per
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>holebottom_ft holetop_ft holestart_ft
width_ft</em></span>[:<span   class="emphasis"><em>w</em></span>|<span   class="emphasis"><em>d</em></span>]
</pre><p>The first two numbers are measured from the floor and the
latter two from the beginning edge of the wall (x = 0, x
increasing). The optional tag on the end indicates that you want
the wall generator to fill the hole with a window or door. Our
floor plan calls for two such hole description files (see Listings
2 and 3). You can use the same data file for multiple walls, but
only if you want them to have the same set of holes.
</p><p><a href="6479l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Hole Description File
(holes/southwall.holes) for the South Wall</a></p><p><a href="6479l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Hole Description File
(holes/eastwall.holes) for the East Wall</a></p><p>The final touch to our cabin is the roof. Generic roof
generation is tricky, so the genroof tool makes you do a bit more
work than the others.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>genroof</b></span> generates planar
pieces of roof; use it multiple times with xform to generate a
whole roof.</p><p>A data file is required for genroof. In the data file,
provide the x-y coordinates (in feet) of the vertexes of the piece
of roof, as read from the floor plan in counterclockwise order
around the edge. The vertexes all must be in the positive quadrant,
and any edge of the peak must run parallel to the x axis.</p><p>To figure out the points from the plan, rotate it so the peak
of the roof runs left to right. Now ignore the bottom half of the
roof, and think of the lower-left corner of the top half as your
new origin. Your points are then (0,0), (21,0), (21, 10.5) and back
to (0,0). Not too bad.</p><p>The points should be entered one per line, separated with a
space, ending with the letter b, mp or p to indicate whether the
point is at the bottom, somewhere in the middle or the peak of the
roof section. This is necessary because it is possible to generate
odd-shaped roof sections for unusual roofs.</p><p>You also need coordinates for the end cap if you want the
genroof utility to fill in the ends of the roof with logs. Looking
at the floor plan in our roof orientation, you easily can see that
the caps should be along the walls at (3,0)&reg;(3,7.5) and
(18,0)&reg;(18,7.5). Add this information to the end of the roof
data file prefixed with the marker c:. The completed roof data file
for the cabin is shown in Listing 4.</p><p><a href="6479l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. The Data for Our Roof
Generator (roofdata)</a></p><p>The command-line call for genroof is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
genroof -o <span   class="emphasis"><em>overhang_ft typename name</em></span> \
        <span   class="emphasis"><em>roofdatafile height_ft thickness_in</em></span>
</pre><p>The overhang parameter allows the utility to adjust the
position of the piece so you can transform it to the height of the
wall without worrying about meeting the slope of the roof. The
completed cabin scene in Listing 5 shows the z transform for the
roof pieces matches the height of the walls, even though the
overhangs will droop below the top of the walls.
</p><p>Our roof is symmetrical, so we use the same genroof with a
different xform to make the other half. That's easy.</p><p><a href="6479l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. The Scene File for a
Complete Cabin</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f7580.0x2cea2a0"></a>Viewing a Scene</h2></div></div><p>Radiance comes with a utility called rad that works like UNIX
make. The input file to rad has a series of variables that tell it
how you want to render a scene, and it figures out how to call the
many other programs used to simulate the light. A commented sample
is shown in Listing 6.</p><p><a href="6479l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6. cabin.rif: an Input File
Telling the rad Utility What Options and Files Are Used to Generate
Pictures</a></p><p>Most of the variables that take filenames can be defined as
many times as there are files that apply. The view variable also
can be defined many times. Each view definition causes the
generation of a picture. You should include a name for the view,
where you want to put your eyeball (<b  >-vp
<i><tt>viewpoint</tt></i></b>), what direction you
want to look (<b  >-vd <i><tt>view direction
vector</tt></i></b>) and which way is up (<b  >-vu
<i><tt>view up vector</tt></i></b>). I also like
the -vt option for generating angular (fish-eye) views.</p><p>Using the H value with the various quality settings can take
a long time (more than ten hours on 2GHz machines). Most times, the
H setting is overkill, and M works fine. Use L for interactive
rendering. The documentation and a little experimentation will help
you figure out what is best for your scene.</p><p>To view a scene interactively, use the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ rad -o x11 cabin.rif
</pre><p>The scene may appear bright and washed out when interactively
viewing. Type <b  >e</b>, press Enter, then click on a
bright spot in the image to fix the exposure. You don't have to
wait for the render to finish.
</p><p>You can experiment with the exposure as much as you want. The
dynamic range of Radiance image data far exceeds the dynamic range
of your monitor. This means you can end up with a completely dark
or completely white image that can be adjusted to your display
without loss of data. This is drastically different from normal
image files where adjusting the brightness too far can cause
permanent loss of information.</p><p>You can load an alternate view from the rif file while
interactively rendering with the <b  >L</b> command. For
example, if you have a view named interior in your rif file, typing
<b  >L interior</b> loads it. You can input a view
manually by typing <b  >v</b> and pressing Enter. Simply
answer the prompts. Type <b  >q</b> and press Enter to
quit the interactive renderer.</p><p>To generate images of all of your views use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ rad cabin.rif
</pre><p>Then view the images with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ximage *.pic
</pre>


You can adjust the exposure of an image in ximage by clicking on
the image and pressing A for auto-exposure, H for human eye
response or = to adjust based on the pixel you clicked.
