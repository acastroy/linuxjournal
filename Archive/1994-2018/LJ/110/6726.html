Fran&ccedil;ois, but part of what makes running Linux so attractive
is it has put the fun back into computing. Sometimes fun is just
plain silly. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Non, mon ami</em></span>, this program does
nothing for your productivity. No, it does not monitor resources
nor help with system administration. Yes, you are correct, it
serves no obvious useful purpose.</p><p>You ask why? Why, Fran&ccedil;ois, do we serve fine wines and
not plain water? Why do we indulge in rich foods and decadent
desserts rather than consuming only what our bodies need? Because
it is fun, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. And why are you not paying
attention to me? What are you looking at?</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Ah, bonjour, mes amis</em></span>! Welcome to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of fine Linux fare, great
wine and the occasional excursion into strange and unusual software
territory. Please sit and Fran&ccedil;ois will pour the wine
<span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>. Fran&ccedil;ois, to the
wine cellar. Fetch the 1997 Eden Valley Hill of Grace Shiraz.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>!</p><p>As you know, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, the focus of this
month's issue is program development. The obvious approach is to
showcase some of the marvelous tools used by talented open-source
programmers to improve and enrich the Linux landscape. It is on
that note that I would like to point out the following: sometimes,
those talented programmers are simply playing, having a bit of fun.
Sometimes, the programs they turn out are silly, bizarre and,
occasionally, plain weird. Those are the people I wish to honor
with today's menu.</p><p>Once upon a time, ASCII art was practiced in e-mail messages
sent around the world. Unfortunately, fancy fonts and HTML-ized
e-mails have struck a powerful blow to this ancient and noble art
form. The most missed are probably the cows, for Tony Monroe,
anyhow. His <span   class="bold"><b>cowsay</b></span> program (a
nice, easy-to-play-with Perl script) provides a simple way to
generate an ASCII cow that speaks your message. Head on over to
<a href="http://www.nog.net/~tony/warez/cowsay.shtml" target="_self">www.nog.net/~tony/warez/cowsay.shtml</a>
to pick up your copy and extract it into your directory. The
installation consists of running an install.sh file. Running the
program also is quite simple. Let's pretend that I want a cow
saying &ldquo;More wine, please&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cowsay More wine please.
-------------------
&lt; More wine please. &gt;
-------------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
</pre><p>With the -e and -T options, you can define the cow's eyes and
tongue. You also can use the -f option to specify any of the other
animals (or cow-like creatures) in the /usr/local/share/cows
directory. You'll even find Tux there. Be warned, however, that
some of the art can be a bit off-color.
</p><p>Talking milk carton, anyone?</p><p>In the world of programmed silliness, a lot can be said for
words. Text, that is. Take, for instance, Andy Gilligan's
<span   class="bold"><b>cack</b></span> program for generating
nonsensical phrases
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cack" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/cack</a>).
&ldquo;So, how would you use <span   class="bold"><b>cack</b></span>?&rdquo;
you may find yourself asking. Say, for instance, you are trying to
answer an e-mail, and you need something totally nonsensical to
make your point. It's cack to the rescue. Simply type
<b  >cack</b> followed by a number to represent how many
lines of nonsense you wish to generate, then press Enter. Here is
an example of what you can expect:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
disintegrate the 95 marauder and the on request
medieval eel billet the unsized aged and the
biochemically amphiprostylar crotchetiness
</pre><p>Your friends will think you are either crazy or brilliant.
</p><p>To take this up a notch, you may want to check out the aptly
named <span   class="bold"><b>nonsense</b></span>. In essence,
nonsense is a clever generator of, well, nonsense. For instance,
with the command <b  >nonsense -f mission.data</b>, you
can generate corporate mission statements like this one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Our mission is to achieve progress in
integrating integrated technologies to produce more
revenue for our head honchos and make our founder
enough cash to exceed the net worth of the world's
richest man.
</pre><p>For nonsense, this is quite a flexible program. With
command-line switches, you can make nonsense generate business
plans, strange names for people, imaginary political organizations,
an impressive geek resume (Figure 1), bizarre laws (&ldquo;It's a Class
C felony in Yellow Walnut, Michigan, to hit a poison ivy plant with
a cardboard box&rdquo;), newspaper headlines (&ldquo;Computer Possessed By
Satanic D&aelig;mon&rdquo;) and even a pretty realistic Slashdot web
page. Some of the output is in HTML format and is suitable for web
pages&mdash;all silly, of course. The many other options and their
results may well keep you busy for hours.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaec580.0xbe4ef8"></a>Figure 1. This
<span   class="bold"><b>Nonsense</b></span> resume is not guaranteed
to get you</h2></div></div><p>a job.
</p><p>To get your own Nonsense&mdash;the program, that is&mdash;pick up the
latest package at
<b  >i-want-a-website.com/about-linux/downloads.shtml</b>.
Other than extracting the tarred and gzipped bundle, there isn't
any compiling to do. Nonsense is a Perl script that works with a
collection of templates. Once you extract the package, make sure
you look through the accompanying README for the various
options.</p><p>Of course, it's not all words, words, words as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Monsieur</em></span> Shakespeare once said. After all, the
importance of music in our lives cannot be overstated, but what
about completely random music? Stephan Beyer's
<span   class="bold"><b>Randomposer</b></span>
(&lt;@url&gt;freshmeat.net/redir/randomposer/8816/url_tgz/randomposer-0.2.6-2.tar.gz)
may be the starting point for an answer to that question, but
perhaps we need to understand the question first. Either way, if
the idea of a million digital monkeys composing your next opus
appeals to you, give this program a try.</p><p>Because Randomposer is a simple Perl script, no compiling
needs to be done. Extract the package, and run
<b  >make</b> from the directory. To run Randomposer,
type <b  >rposer</b> and your random music will play. You
can save the music, change the beats per minute and introduce other
non-random elements into your creation with command-line
parameters. Type <b  >rposer --help</b> for
details.</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois, it appears that our guests' glasses are
nearly empty. Please refill them. Could you also run to the kitchen
and bring out the cheese trays? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Merci.</em></span></p><p>So, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, we now have words and
music. With a little eye candy, we could have a complete multimedia
experience, in a strange sort of way. Those of you running a KDE
desktop can take advantage of a clever bit of silliness that comes
as part of the <span   class="bold"><b>kdetoys</b></span> package.
It's called AMOR, an acronym that appropriately stands for Amusing
Misuse Of Resources.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaec580.0xbe5528"></a>Figure 2. Some of AMOR's tips are not only
useful, but wise.</h2></div></div><p>AMOR is a little animated character that sits on your open
windows. By default, it comes up as a little yellow spot (or happy
face) that jets around, smiles, winks at you and occasionally
bursts into flame. Turn on the random tips feature, and your
character occasionally throws up tips, some dealing with your
system's capabilities and others dealing with more mundane
topics.</p><p>Incidentally, the demand AMOR places on resources isn't
particularly bad (of course, it does add to your processing
demands), so you shouldn't have to worry too much about it.</p><p>When AMOR pauses in one spot, you can right-click on the
character to change the options. AMOR can be transformed into a
kitten, a ghost or our favorite mascot, Tux. Some characters are
animated and others sit quietly doing nothing more than taking up a
few pixels. One of these static characters is a visitor from
another strange (but great fun) Linux program&mdash;little Bill from
Brian Wellington and Matias Duarte's
<span   class="bold"><b>XBill</b></span> (available at
<a href="http://www.xbill.org" target="_self">www.xbill.org</a>).</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi</em></span>? You do not know about XBill? Then
you must download it immediately and start saving the world's
computer networks from an evil hacker known only as Bill, as he
tries to load a virus (cleverly disguised as an operating system)
onto otherwise healthy computers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaec580.0xbe5840"></a>Figure 3. Only you can stop Bill.</h2></div></div><p>Well, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, looking at the clock, I
can see that time is unfortunately running out. Speaking of
time&mdash;why, in this world of fancy graphics and eye candy, someone
would want an ncurses <span   class="bold"><b>analog</b></span> clock
is a question best left to the philosophers (or the programmer
known only as Tommy). Should you be that someone, then maybe it is
time to download and install
<span   class="bold"><b>clockywock</b></span>. It features an hour,
minute and sweeping second hand, all generated in a full-text
terminal from nothing but ASCII characters. You can download it
from <a href="http://www.soomka.com" target="_self">www.soomka.com</a>.
Building clockywock is simply a matter of typing
<b  >make</b>; there is but one source file, and it
compiles to produce the clockywock program.</p><p>Before I leave this subject of time, I would do you all a
great disservice if I did not mention
<span   class="bold"><b>XDaliClock</b></span>, a fascinating
graphical clock where numbers don't change so much as morph from
one second to the next. The Dali Clock has been around for some
time, and there is a good possibility you may find it on your
distribution disk and, perhaps, already installed on your system.
Should you need to download a copy, head on over to
<a href="http://www.jwz.org/xdaliclock" target="_self">www.jwz.org/xdaliclock</a>.
You even can download a version for your Palm device.</p><p>For a particularly psychedelic effect, run the program with
the -cycle option and your clock not only morphs from second to
second, but takes on a flowing color palette as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaec580.0xbe5c60"></a>Figure 4. The Magical Morphing
XDaliClock</h2></div></div><p>Time is indeed passing quickly and the closing hour has
arrived. But, of course, another glass of wine is certainly in
order, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Nothing strange there.
Fran&ccedil;ois, kindly pour our guests another glass. Always
remember that the cost of silliness may be no more than a few
laughs. Until next time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, let us all
drink to one another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre
sant&eacute;</em></span>! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bon
