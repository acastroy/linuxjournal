<a href="http://www.libsdl.org" target="_self">www.libsdl.org</a>) is a
simple, yet powerful, cross-platform game and multimedia
development library. The library was developed by Sam Latinga while
he was working for Loki Software, Inc. and was used in their
commercial game projects. SDL was developed to meet the needs of
game developers working in a multi-OS environment and was used in
the Linux versions of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Maelstrom</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hopkins FBI</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Civilization: Call to
Power</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent 2</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>MythII:
Soulblighter</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Railroad Tycoon II</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span> and many more. The SDL web site
lists hundreds of games and applications written using SDL.
</p><p>SDL officially supports Linux, Windows, BeOS, Mac OS, Mac OS
X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, BSD/OS, Solaris and IRIX. SDL also works with
Windows CE, AmigaOS, Atari, QNX, NetBSD, AIX, Tru64 UNIX and
SymbianOS. However, those OSes are not yet officially supported.
This means if you write your application using SDL, you can port it
with minimal rework to all those OSes. SDL provides a portable way
to write games and multimedia applications on every major OS
currently in use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7c580.0x1c749d0"></a>Installing SDL</h2></div></div><p>If you are using a recent version of Linux, you probably have
a complete SDL installation. In fact, a quick check of /usr/bin
using <b  >ldd</b> on my Red Hat 8.0 system found eight
programs that depend on SDL.</p><p>The following commands show whether the SDL libraries and
C/C++ include files are installed on your system:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
locate SDL.h
locate libSDL
locate sdl-config
</pre><p>If all of these commands report the file was found, most
likely you have a complete SDL installation, and you need only to
make sure it is up to date. The sdl-config program checks the SDL
version and acquires compile and link flags for your SDL
applications. If sdl-config was found, run:
<pre     class="programlisting">
sdl-config --version
</pre>


to see which version of SDL you have. If sdl-config reports a
version less than 1.2.4, you should install newer libraries. Like
most open-source projects, SDL is under constant development, so if
you are using SDL for development, check for new versions regularly
or join one of the SDL mailing lists to keep track of library
updates.
</p><p>If SDL is not installed, you need to download and install it.
Your distribution probably has precompiled SDL packages, so you can
check your regular source of packages first. If it's up to date,
the easiest way to get started is to install the devel or dev
packages for SDL from your distribution.</p><p>The file sdl-install.sh included with the source code used in
this article is a shell script that downloads and installs version
1.2.5 of SDL and all its add-on libraries. The script must be run
as root in the directory where you want the source for SDL. The
script downloads the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SDL&mdash;the core of SDL
(<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download.php" target="_self">www.libsdl.org/download.php</a>)</p></li><li><p>SDL_net&mdash;the network I/O library
(<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net" target="_self">www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net</a>)</p></li><li><p>SDL_image&mdash;the image reading library

(<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf" target="_self">www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf</a>)</p></li></ul></div><p>If you don't use sdl-install.sh, visit the web pages listed
above, download the files, unpack them and follow the instructions
in the appropriate README files to install the libraries. Test your
new installation by running:
<pre     class="programlisting">
sdl-config --version
</pre>


If it doesn't run or gives a version number lower than the version
you installed, the installation didn't work. In my experience, this
happens when I don't follow the instructions or leave an old
version of SDL installed in a different place. If <b  >locate
sdl-config</b> lists more than one location, either delete
the old SDL installation, something I hate to do, or re-install
over the old version. The sdl-install.sh file shows how to use
<b  >./configure --prefix</b> to install SDL anywhere you
want, but it's safest and easiest to install in the default
location.

Sample programs are included with SDL, and its support libraries
are great starting places for your own projects.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7c580.0x1c75528"></a>SDL Example</h2></div></div><p>The file bounce.cpp [available at
<a href="../listings/110/6410.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue110/6410.tgz</a>]
is a game written using SDL for input and graphics and SDL_ttf to
load TrueType fonts. The game itself is a little over 1,300 lines
of C++, and the complete package includes the source code, images,
a TrueType font, a makefile, sdl-install.sh and the license files
for the font and images used in the game. Finding fonts, graphics
and sounds that you can use legally in your games can be more work
than writing the game.</p><p>To get started learning SDL, download the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span> source code from the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site and unpack it with <b  >tar -xzvf
bounce.tar.gz</b>. Then run <b  >make</b> to build
the program. Run the program by typing <b  >bounce</b> at
the command line. You can run it in full-screen mode by typing
<b  >bounce -fullscreen</b>. The plot of the game is that
Earth has started wandering around the solar system and is in
danger of falling into the Sun. Your job is to keep Earth out of
the Sun by hitting it with the Moon. You score a point each time
you hit the Earth with the Moon, and the game scores every time the
Earth hits the Sun. The game is designed to show off features of
SDL, not to be the most interesting game you've ever seen.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6410f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7c580.0x1c75b00"></a>Initialize SDL</h2></div></div><p>SDL must be initialized before any SDL functions are used by
calling SDL_Init():</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (-1 == SDL_Init((SDL_INIT_VIDEO |
                    SDL_INIT_TIMER |
                    SDL_INIT_EVENTTHREAD)))
{
  ...
}
</pre><p>The parameter to SDL_Init() identifies the subsystems that
need to be initialized. Here, I tell SDL to initialize the video,
timer and subsystems and to use thread-based event processing. I
also could have used the catch-all SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING, but you
should initialize only the parts of SDL that your program uses.
There is no reason to initialize the joystick or CD-ROM if you are
not going to use them. You can initialize and shut down subsystems
at any time by the use of the SDL_InitSubSystem() and
SDL_QuitSubSystem() functions.
</p><p>It is important to shut down SDL with a call to SDL_Quit()
before your program shuts down. SDL_Quit() shuts down all SDL
subsystems, frees all system resources used by SDL and restores the
video mode. It is good practice to use atexit() to make sure that
SDL_Quit() runs when your program terminates. Failure to call
SDL_Quit() can leave your computer in a strange video mode.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7c580.0x206df60"></a>Set the Video Mode</h2></div></div><p>When selecting a video mode, decide whether to run in a
window or as a full-screen application. Then, choose the size of
the window or screen. If you go with a window, decide whether the
user can resize it. Then, choose how to adapt to the color depth of
the screen. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span> I use something
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
options = SDL_ANYFORMAT |  SDL_FULLSCREEN;
screen = SDL_SetVideoMode(640, 480,
                          0,
                          options);
</pre><p>The first two parameters specify the width and height, in
pixels, of the screen or window in which the program runs. To use a
particular width and height in full-screen mode, the screen section
of your XF86Config-4 (or XF86Config for some versions of X) file
must list the specified size. If <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span> won't
run in full-screen mode on your machine, it is most likely because
you don't have a 640 &times; 480 mode set up in the screen section
of your XF86Config-4 file.
</p><p>The third parameter specifies the number of bits per pixel.
Or, if it is set to 0 (zero), it tells SDL to use the current
display depth. It is best to adapt the game to the current display
depth rather than counting on every machine on which the code will
ever run to support your desired pixel format.</p><p>The last parameter lets you give SDL detailed instructions on
how to set up the video mode. There are nearly a dozen options from
which to chose. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span>, I use SDL_ANYFORMAT
to let SDL pick the best available mode. This option forces your
code to adapt to whatever pixel depth you have, but using it can
provide better performance at the cost of some extra coding. The
SDL_FULLSCREEN option tells SDL to set a full-screen mode.</p><p>The value returned by SDL_SetVideoMode() is a pointer to an
SDL_Surface structure. This structure describes the screen in great
detail. If the pointer is NULL, the video mode you requested is not
available. But, getting a non-NULL value doesn't mean you got
everything you wanted. Check the flags field of this structure
against the options you specified. I have found it is best to ask
for little and work with what I receive, that way I avoid hard
wiring my machine and OS restrictions in my code.</p><p>Now that the video mode is configured, use
SDL_WM_SetCaption() to set the window title and icon name. This
isn't necessary; it's one of those touches that make the program a
little easier to use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SDL_WM_SetCaption("Bounce", "Bounce")
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7c580.0x206e3d8"></a>Loading Resources</h2></div></div><p>Before <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span> can start up, it must load
and initialize the resources it uses. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span>
has to initialize colors, load a few images and load the font it
uses to draw text. Because the video mode was set using
SDL_ANYFORMAT, all of these resources have to be converted to match
an arbitrary display format. The following code creates a red pixel
in the format we need:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SDL_PixelFormat *pf = screen-&gt;format;
int red = SDL_MapRGB(pf, 0xff, 0x00, 0x00);
</pre><p>The SDL_PixelFormat structure is a description of the screen
pixels, and SDL_MapRGB() converts a standard 24-bit RGB color
representation into a pixel value that shows that color when drawn
on that screen.
</p><p>Loading images is slightly more complex:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SDL_Surface *s0, *s1;
s0 = SDL_LoadBMP(name);
s1 = SDL_DisplayFormat(s0);
SDL_SetColorKey(s1,
                (SDL_SRCCOLORKEY |
                 SDL_RLEACCEL),
                black);
SDL_FreeSurface(s0);
</pre><p>Core SDL includes SDL_LoadBMP(), which loads a .bmp format
image as an SDL_Surface. SDL_image provides routines for loading
many other image formats. The image is in the format in which it
was created. We convert it to the display format using
SDL_DisplayFormat(). SDL_SetColorKey() is used to tell SDL that
when it copies (blits) this surface into another surface, it should
ignore all the black pixels. I do this so that when I copy an image
of the Earth onto the screen, none of the black background gets
copied, and only the pixels inside the round shape of the Earth are
touched. The SDL_RLEACCEL flag tells SDL to run length encode (RLE)
the image. Using RLE-encoded images speeds up image copying.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span> uses one TrueType font but in
three different sizes, two different colors and three different
styles. Using the SDL_ttf library, I wrote a routine that loads a
TrueType font, renders each of the ASCII characters in the range of
0-127 as an SDL_Surface, converts each character to match the
screen and saves the height, width and advance of each letter so I
can draw strings on the screen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7c580.0x206e7f8"></a>The Main Loop</h2></div></div><p>SDL provides an event-based input system, much like that used
by X, Mac OS and Windows. When a key is pressed or the mouse is
moved, an event is placed in a queue. The program can either wait
for events using SDL_WaitEvent() or poll for events using
SDL_PollEvent(). The main loop must process events, update the game
state, draw the next frame and repeat until done.</p><p>The decision to wait or poll for events affects the overall
structure of the game. I chose to wait for events and use a
heartbeat timer to drive the action. I like this combination
because it lets the program handle events whenever they occur while
controlling CPU usage. Both of those qualities are important in
networked games.</p><p>The timer is initialized using:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
timer = SDL_AddTimer(10, timerCallback, NULL);
</pre><p>This tells SDL to call a routine named timerCallBack every
ten milliseconds. My timer callback uses SDL_PushEvent() to send an
event. Because timer callbacks run in a separate thread, they can
send events even though the game is stopped, waiting for events.
When it receives a timer event, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span> checks
to see if it is time to draw another frame. The timer makes sure
the program doesn't try to draw more than 100 frames/second, while
allowing the game to run at a slower rate if it must. On my
machine, it runs at 85 frames/second, which matches the refresh
rate of my monitor.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span> is organized into several
different pages. The main loop handles events that are common among
all the pages, such as quitting the program when you press Esc or
pausing the game when you press F1. After the main loop has looked
at an event, it passes the event to the current page. Each page is
a function that takes an SDL_Event as its parameter. Each page has
the responsibility to handle events, keep track of the time and
draw the screen. Although this approach leads to some duplicate
code, it gives the programmer greater flexibility, and it lends
itself to an object-oriented design where each page is an instance
of a page class. The following example shows parts of the main loop
and illustrates how events are passed to the individual
pages:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
while ((!done) &amp;&amp; SDL_WaitEvent(&amp;event))
{
  switch (event.type)
  {
  case SDL_QUIT:
    done = true;
    break;
  case SDL_KEYDOWN:
    switch(event.key.keysym.sym)
    {
    case SDLK_ESCAPE:
      done = true;
      break;
    case SDLK_F1:
      play = !play;
      break;
    }
    break;
  }
  if (play &amp;&amp;
      (!done) &amp;&amp;
      (NULL != currentPage))
  {
    currentPage(&amp;event);
  }
}
</pre><p>The global variable currentPage points to the implementation
of the current page. When one page wants to start another page, it
initializes the new page and sets the pointer to that page.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span> has three pages: the welcome page you
see when the program starts, another page handles game play, and
the &ldquo;You Won/You Lost&rdquo; message is the third page.
</p><p>The event handler in the welcome page looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
switch (e-&gt;type)
{
  case SDL_USEREVENT:
    switch (e-&gt;user.code)
    {
    case MY_TIMEREVENT:
      now = SDL_GetTicks();
      dt = now - lastTime;
      if (dt &gt;= minFrameTime)
      {
        drawWelcome(dt);
        lastTime = now;
      }
      break;
    }
    break;
case SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
  initBounce();
  currentPage = bounce;
  break;
}
</pre><p>When this code sees a timer event, it checks how long it has
been since it last updated the screen and calls drawWelcome() to
animate the screen. When it sees that a mouse button has been
pressed, it switches to the game page by calling initBounce() to
get it ready and then sets currentPage to point to the game page.
The next time through, the main loop bounce() will be called.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7c580.0x206ed78"></a>Animation</h2></div></div><p>The animation routine uses the dirty pixels technique so only
a small portion of the screen is redrawn for each frame. With this
technique, we keep track of the last position in which an object
was drawn and the new position. When <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span>
draws the Earth, first it erases the dirty pixels where it was by
filling them with the background color, and then it draws the Earth
in its new location. We fill rectangles and draw images
using:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SDL_FillRect(screen, rectangle, color);
SDL_BlitSurface(image, NULL, screen, rectangle);
</pre><p>SDL_FillRect() fills a rectangle in an SDL_Surface, like the
screen, with a color. The rectangle is specified using an SDL_Rect
structure, and the color is created using SDL_MapRGB().
SDL_BlitSurface() copies a rectangle from one surface into a
rectangle in another surface. If the source rectangle is NULL then
the whole surface is copied. SDL_BlitSurface() is the routine that
applies the color key and takes advantage of RLE encoding.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7c580.0x206ef88"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>SDL reduces the time it takes to write games on Linux. It is
small enough that learning it is a project, not a career, and it is
powerful enough for commercial applications. I hope that between
the information in this article and the source code for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span>, you have learned enough of SDL to
start modifying <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce</em></span> and building your own
