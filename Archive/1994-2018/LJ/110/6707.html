It has no frills, like address books, but it does allow you IMAP
access to your mail server. It sports folders for storing and
classifying mail. You can reply, forward and compose mail messages.
All the important functions are present, but not a lot else.
Perfect for road warriors who use a regular mail client when they
return. Requires: web server; PHP, compiled with IMAP support; IMAP

Development</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>FUSE (filesystem in user space)
Project</b></span> has reached version 1.0. One of the basic ideas
of UNIX is to provide tools that perform fundamental operations in
generic, interoperable ways. These tools typically work on streams
of data stored in the filesystem as files. But some tools,
including SSH, FTP and compression tools, interfere with this,
because they either convert the files into a difficult-to-use state
or they interact with systems located elsewhere on a network. Still
other tools insist on providing all control internally to
themselves, so none of the basic UNIX tools are of any use. FUSE
allows the user to layer the appearance of a filesystem over any or
all of these programs, so all operations can be done as file
manipulations, taking advantage of the great wealth of basic tools
available in UNIX.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>virtual memory (VM)</b></span>
subsystem in 2.4 now has some good documentation, courtesy of
<span   class="bold"><b>Mel Gorman.</b></span> Once upon a time,
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> dropped an entirely
new VM subsystem into the Linux kernel, smack dab in the middle of
a stable release series. This was tremendously controversial among
developers, one reason being that Andrea Arcangeli, the author of
the new code, provided virtually no documentation of any kind. Mel
put in six months of work, much more than he originally thought
would be necessary, resulting in a solid explanation of the
workings of the entire VM, along with specific commentary on the
source code itself.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>Kernel Bug Database</b></span> has
been documented extensively by its creator,
<span   class="bold"><b>John Bradford.</b></span> Intended as an
improvement over the current Bugzilla database used by a number of
developers, the Kernel Bug Database rejects a generic approach,
providing features based on the specific needs of the Linux kernel,
such as the ability to search based on options in the .config
file.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Dynamic kernel module support
(DKMS)</b></span> has come from a developer group at Dell. A GPLed
project, it aims to allow device driver source code to reside
anywhere on the filesystem, not only in the kernel source tree.
This makes it easier for vendors to release new versions of their
drivers and for users to recompile those drivers. As of March 2003,
DKMS is 2.4-specific, and it doesn't take account of some of the
massive reworkings appearing in 2.5, especially with the module
code itself.</p><p>Several groups are working to implement
<span   class="bold"><b>IPSec for IPv6</b></span>. The IPSec suite of
protocols presents a framework for providing privacy and
authentication support at the IP address layer, while IPv6 attempts
to expand the number of available IP addresses. Although IPv6 is
not yet in widespread use, it is important to continue to build the
infrastructure to one day migrate away from the ailing IPv4
standard. <span   class="bold"><b>Kazunori Miyazawa, Kunihiro
Ishiguro, Hideaki Yoshifuji</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Mitsuru Kanda</b></span> recently joined
forces to produce working IPv6 IPSec support in the 2.5 kernel
tree.</p><p>&mdash;Zack Brown</p><p><a href="http://www.claws-and-paws.com/software" target="_self">Furball</a></p><p>Here's a fun game for the kids, but you can edit it and make
