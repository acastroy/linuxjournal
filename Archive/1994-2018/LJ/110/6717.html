    The 2.5 kernel implements a unified device driver model that
    will make driver development for 2.6 easier.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d9580.0x24d1660"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the 2.5 Linux kernel development
series, a unified device driver model framework was created by Pat
Mochel. This framework consists of a number of common structures
and functions all device driver subsystems have been converted to
use. It also consists of some generic structures that are starting
to be used outside of the driver code by other parts of the kernel.
This article discusses parts of the driver model and provides an
example of how to convert a specific device driver subsystem to the
driver model.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d9580.0x24d1768"></a>Buses, Devices and Classes</h2></div></div><p>The driver framework breaks all things down into buses,
devices and classes. Using these primitives, it controls how
drivers are matched up with physical and virtual devices, and it
shows the user how all of these things are interconnected.</p><p>A bus can be described as something with devices connected to
it. Examples of buses are PCI, USB, i2c, PCMCIA and SCSI. Usually
only one bus driver controls the activity on a bus, and it provides
a type of bridge from the bus it is on to the bus it
controls.</p><p>An example of a bridge is a USB controller that lives on the
PCI bus. It talks to the PCI bus as a PCI device and looks to the
kernel as a PCI driver. But it controls all access to that specific
USB bus, talking to the different USB devices plugged in to
it.</p><p>Buses are represented in the kernel with the struct bus_type
definition, found in include/linux/device.h. All buses in the
system are shown to the user in subdirectories of the sysfs
directory /sys/bus/.</p><p><a href="6717s1.html" target="_self">Sidebar: Sysfs</a></p><p>Devices are physical or virtual devices that reside on a bus.
They are represented by the struct device definition and are
created by the bus when the bus sees they are present in the
system. Usually only one driver controls a specific device at one
time. They can be seen in the /sys/devices directory as a giant
tree of all devices in the system or in the
/sys/bus/<span   class="emphasis"><em>BUS_TYPE</em></span>/devices/ directory for a
specific type of device.</p><p>Devices also have drivers assigned to them that control how
to talk to the device across a specific bus. Some drivers know how
to talk to multiple buses, such as the Tulip network driver, which
can talk to PCI and ISA Tulip devices. All drivers are represented
by the struct device_driver definition. They can be seen in sysfs
at /sys/bus/<span   class="emphasis"><em>BUS_TYPE</em></span>/drivers/. Drivers
register with a specific bus and export a list of different types
of devices they can support. The bus matches the devices and
drivers based on this list of exported devices. The list also is
exported to user space so the /sbin/hotplug tools can be used to
match drivers to devices that do not have drivers already loaded.
See my article, &ldquo;Hot Plug&rdquo;, in the April 2002 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i> for more information on this
interface and how it works [also available at
<a href="../096/5604.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5604</a>].</p><p>Classes here do not take the general object-oriented
definition but, rather, are things that provide a function to the
user. They are not bus- or device-specific things but functionally
look to the user as the same type of device. Examples of classes
are audio devices; pointing devices, such as mice and touchpads;
keyboards; joysticks; IDE disks; and tty devices. The kernel always
has had these kinds of devices, and they traditionally have been
grouped together by major/minor number range, so the user can
access them easily. Classes are represented in the kernel with the
struct device_class definition, and they can be seen as
subdirectories of the sysfs directory /sys/class/.</p><p>For a description of the whole driver model, along with an
introduction to the structures below the driver model that do all
of the real work, see the thorough document at
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mochel/doc/lca/driver-model-lca2003.tar.gz" target="_self">www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/mochel/doc/lca/driver-model-lca2003.tar.gz</a>.
It was written by Pat Mochel for the 2003 Linux.Conf.Au
conference.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d9580.0x24d1d40"></a>Theory in Action</h2></div></div><p>All of the above descriptions sound great on paper, but how
does the driver model actually affect the kernel code? To show
this, let us walk through how the i2c driver subsystem was modified
to support this driver model.</p><p>The i2c code has lived outside of the main kernel tree for a
long time, and it was offered as a patch for the 2.0, 2.2 and 2.4
kernels. It also was the subject of &ldquo;Using the i2c Bus&rdquo;, by Simon
G. Vogl, one of the main authors of the code
[<i  >LJ</i>, March 1997,
<a href="../035/1342.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/1342</a>].
In the 2.4 development cycle, a number of the i2c core files and a
few i2c bus drivers were accepted into the main kernel. In the 2.5
development cycle, a few more drivers were added; hopefully, all of
them eventually will migrate into the main tree. For a good
description of the i2c code, what devices it supports and how to
use it, see the main development site at
<a href="http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/index.html" target="_self">secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/index.html</a>.</p><p>When loaded, the i2c bus drivers, which talk to the i2c
controller chips, export a number of files in the /proc/bus
directory. When an i2c device driver is loaded and bound to an i2c
device, it exports files and directories in the
/proc/sys/dev/sensors directory. By moving the representation of
the devices and buses to the kernel driver core, all of these
separate files can be shown in their proper places in /sys.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d9580.0x24d2000"></a>The i2c Bus</h2></div></div><p>The main i2c bus subsystem needs to be declared in the kernel
and registered with the driver core. To accomplish this, the
following code was added to drivers/i2c/i2c-core.c:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static int i2c_device_match(struct device *dev,
                          struct device_driver *drv)
{
    return 1;
}
struct bus_type i2c_bus_type = {
    .name =    "i2c",
    .match =   i2c_device_match,
};
</pre><p>The name field says what the bus should be called, and the
match field points to our match function. Right now, the match
function is left alone, always returning 1 whenever the driver core
wants to try to match a driver with a device. This logic will be
modified at a later time.
</p><p>Then, in the i2c core startup code, the i2c_bus_type is
registered with a call to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bus_register(&amp;i2c_bus_type);
</pre><p>When the i2c core is shut down, a call is added to unregister
this bus:
<pre     class="programlisting">
bus_unregister(&amp;i2c_bus_type);
</pre>


When the above code runs, the following tree is created in sysfs:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tree /sys/bus/i2c/
/sys/bus/i2c/
|-- devices
'-- drivers
</pre>


When the i2c core is removed from the system, the above directories
are removed. This is all that is needed to create the i2c bus.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d9580.0x24d2370"></a>i2c Adapters</h2></div></div><p>An i2c bus by itself is pretty boring. Now, the i2c bus
adapter drivers need to be modified to register themselves with
this bus. To do this, a struct device variable is added to the
struct i2c_adapter structure:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct i2c_adapter {
    .....
    struct device dev;
};
</pre><p>A to_i2c_adapter() macro is defined as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#define to_i2c_adapter(d) container_of(d,
struct i2c_adapter, dev)
</pre>


This macro is used by the i2c core to get a pointer to a real
i2c_adapter structure whenever the driver core passes it a pointer
to a struct device.
</p><p>The struct device in the i2c_adapter is a whole variable
declared within the structure, not merely a pointer. This is done
so when the driver core passes a pointer to a struct device, the
i2c code can use the to_i2c_adapter() macro to get a pointer to the
real i2c_adapter structure.</p><p><a href="6717s2.html" target="_self">Sidebar:
container_of()</a></p><p>The individual struct i2c_driver variables are declared in
the different i2c bus drivers. For example, in the i2c-piix4.c
driver, there is a variable called piix4_adapter of type struct
i2c_driver. This variable is passed to the i2c core in the
i2c_add_adapter() function, when a PIIX4 adapter is seen by the
i2c-piix4 driver.</p><p>In the i2c-piix4.c driver, before i2c_add_adapter() is
called, a pointer to the parent device of the PIIX4 adapter needs
to be saved within the i2c_driver structure. This is done with a
single line of code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
piix4_adapter.dev.parent = &amp;dev-&gt;dev;
</pre><p>dev is a pointer to the struct pci_dev that is passed to the
i2c-piix4 driver's PCI probe function; the PIIX4 is a PCI-based
device.
</p><p>To link the i2c_driver variable to the sysfs tree, the
following lines of code are added to the i2c_add_adapter()
function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* add the adapter to the driver core.
 * The parent pointer should already
 * have been set up.
 */
sprintf(adap-&gt;dev.bus_id, "i2c-%d", i);
strcpy(adap-&gt;dev.name, "i2c controller");
device_register(&amp;adap-&gt;dev);
</pre><p>With this code, when the PIIX4 device is detected by the
driver, an i2c bus tree is created and linked to the controlling
PCI device:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tree /sys/devices/pci0/00:07.3/i2c-0
/sys/devices/pci0/00:07.3/i2c-0
|-- name
`-- power
</pre>


When the i2c-piix4 driver is unloaded, the i2c_del_adapter()
function is called. The following line of code is added to clean up
the i2c bus device:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* clean up the sysfs representation */
device_unregister(&amp;adap-&gt;dev);
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d9580.0x24d29a0"></a>i2c Drivers</h2></div></div><p>The i2c bus has a number of different drivers that control
access to a wide range of i2c devices that live on the i2c bus.
These drivers are declared with a struct i2c_driver structure.
Within this structure, a struct device_driver variable is added to
allow these drivers to be registered with the driver core:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct i2c_driver {
    .....
    struct device_driver driver;
};
</pre><p>And, a to_i2c_driver() macro is defined as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#define to_i2c_driver(d) container_of(d, struct
i2c_driver, driver)
</pre>


An i2c driver registers itself with the i2c core in a call to
i2c_add_driver(). To add driver core support for i2c drivers, the
following lines of code are added to this function:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* add the driver to the list of
 *i2c drivers in the driver core */
driver-&gt;driver.name = driver-&gt;name;
driver-&gt;driver.bus = &amp;i2c_bus_type;
driver-&gt;driver.probe = i2c_device_probe;
driver-&gt;driver.remove = i2c_device_remove;

retval = driver_register(&amp;driver-&gt;driver);
if (retval)
    return retval;
</pre>


This sets up the driver core structure to have the same name as the
driver and a bus type of i2c_bus_type; the probe and remove
functions are set to local i2c functions. For now, these functions
are declared as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
int i2c_device_probe(struct device *dev)
{
    return -ENODEV;
}

int i2c_device_remove(struct device *dev)
{
    return 0;
}
</pre>


because no i2c device support has been added yet. These functions
will be called when an i2c device is added or removed from the
driver core, but that will be described in the next column.
</p><p>When the i2c_add_driver() is called, the driver is registered
with the i2c_bus_type, and it shows up in sysfs as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ tree /sys/bus/i2c/
/sys/bus/i2c/
|-- devices
`-- drivers
    |-- EEPROM READER
    `-- W83781D sensors
</pre><p>To remove an i2c driver from the system, the i2c_del_driver()
function is called. In order to remove the i2c driver from the
driver core that was registered with the call to driver_register,
the following line of code is added to this function:
<pre     class="programlisting">
driver_unregister(&amp;driver-&gt;driver);
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23d9580.0x28cb010"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>We have covered the basics of the new driver core, and to

we covered the changes needed to convert the i2c core to support
the kernel core bus and driver model. In the next Driving Me Nuts
column, we will cover how to add i2c device support and how the
