    If you want the convenience of SQL without the size and setup hassles of a database server, embed SQLite right in your program, whatever your favorite language.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe29580.0xf213a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>SQLite is a powerful, embedded relational
database management system in a compact C library, developed by D.
Richard Hipp. It offers support for a large subset of SQL92,
multiple tables and indexes, transactions, views, triggers and a
vast array of client interfaces and drivers. The library is
self-contained and implemented in less than 25,000 lines of ANSI C,
which is free to use for any purpose. It is fast, efficient and
scalable, and it runs on a wide variety of platforms and hardware
architectures ranging from ARM/Linux to SPARC/Solaris. Furthermore,
its database format is binary-compatible between machines with
different byte orders and scales up to 2 terabytes (241 bytes) in
size.
</p><p>Hipp conceived of the idea of SQLite while working with a
team from General Dynamics on a program for the US Navy for use
onboard the DDG class of destroyers. The program ran on HP-UX and
used an Informix database. As they began the project, they quickly
found that Informix can be rather difficult to work with. It runs
fine once you get it going, but it can take a full day for an
experienced DBA to install or upgrade.</p><p>At the time, the team was using Linux and PostgreSQL for
development work. PostgreSQL required considerably less
administration, but they still wanted to be able to produce a
standalone program that would run anywhere, regardless of what
other software was installed on the host platform. In January 2000,
Hipp and a colleague discussed the idea of writing a simple
embedded SQL database engine that would use GDBM as its back end,
one that would require no installation or administrative support
whatsoever. Later, during a funding hiatus, Hipp started writing it
on his own, and SQLite version 1.0 soon came to life.</p><p>General Dynamics started using SQLite in place of PostgreSQL
right away. SQLite allowed them to generate a standalone executable
that could be installed quickly and easily on wearable computers
and laptops for display at tradeshows and sales meetings. Informix
still is being used for shipboard operation; however, the Naval
office in charge of ongoing maintenance of the program recently has
been e-mailing Hipp for help in compiling SQLite on an HP 9000. So,
things may be changing.</p><p>Major changes came about with version 2.0. Version 1 used
GDBM for storage, which uses unordered keys (aka hashing). This
limited what SQLite could do. Furthermore, GDBM is released under
the GPL, which discouraged some from trying it. In January 2001,
Hipp began working on his own B*Tree-based back end to replace
GDBM. The new B*Tree subsystem stores records in key order, which
permits optimizations such as logarithmic time MIN() and MAX()
functions and indexed queries with inequality constraints. It also
supports transactions. The end result was a much more capable
database. Version 2.0 was released into the public domain in
September 2001.</p><p>SQLite started to take off with version 2.0. Dozens of people
began writing in to tell how they were using it in commercial and
free products. A few even contracted Hipp for technical support or
custom modifications. According to Hipp, at least one widely used
program for Windows incorporates a modified version of SQLite in
recent releases. SQLite also is being used at Duke Energy and in
other branches of the US military, besides the Navy project that
originally inspired it.</p><p>Since its public release a year and a half ago, SQLite has
been gaining features and users at a speedy clip. A quick look at
the SQLite Wiki reveals many more applications whose developers
have discovered SQLite and put it to use in their software. It even
has its own Apache module (mod_auth_sqlite), which seems to be a
sign of success in its own right. As the creators of PySQLite, a
Python extension for SQLite, Gerhard H&auml;ring and I have been
surprised to see more than 3,000 downloads in less than a year.
Currently, SQLite is the highest-rated database engine on
&lt;@url&gt;freshmeat.net.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe29580.0xf216b8"></a>Architecture</h2></div></div><p>SQLite has an elegant, modular design. It can be divided into
eight primary subsystems (Figure 1), some of which take rather
interesting approaches to relational database management.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6650f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. SQLite Architecture
</p></div></div><p>At the top of the diagram is the parser and tokenizer. SQLite
includes its own highly optimized parser generator, called the
Lemon parser, which produces fast, efficient code, and by virtue of
its novel design, it is especially resistant to memory leaks. At
the bottom is an optimized B-Tree implementation, based on Knuth,
which runs on top of an adjustable page cache, helping to minimize
disk seeks. The page cache, in turn, operates on an OS abstraction
layer that helps make the library more portable.</p><p>At the library's core is the virtual database engine. The
VDBE performs all operations related to data manipulation and is
the broker through which information is passed between client and
storage. In many ways, it is the heart of SQLite. The VDBE comes
into play after the SQL is parsed. The code generator takes the
parse tree and translates it into a mini-program, which is made up
of a series of instructions expressed in the VDBE's virtual machine
language. One by one, the VDBE executes each instruction, which
ends by fulfilling whatever request was specified in the SQL
statement.</p><p>The VDBE's machine language consists of 128 opcodes, all
centered around database management. There are opcodes for opening
tables, searching indexes, storing and deleting records and many
other database operations. Each instruction in the VDBE consists of
an opcode and up to three operands. Some instructions use all three
operands; others use none. It all depends on the nature of the
instruction. For example, the Open instruction, which opens a
cursor on a table, uses all three operands. The first operand (P1)
contains the ID by which the cursor will be identified. The second
operand (P2) refers to the location of the root (or first) page of
the table, and the third operand is the table's name. The Rollback
instruction, on the other hand, requires no operands at all. The
only thing the VDBE needs to know in order to perform a rollback is
whether or not to do one.</p><p>For any given SQL statement, you can view the generated VDBE
program using the explain command in the SQLite shell. Listing 1
shows a simple example.</p><p><a href="6650l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
<span   class="bold"><b>explain</b></span> Results for a Simple
Query</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>explain</b></span> is not only useful
for gaining better insight into the workings of the VDBE but also
for practical matters like query optimization. The VDBE is really a
subject in itself. Fortunately, for those who are interested, it is
well documented, and its theory of operation along with its opcodes
are covered in great detail on the SQLite web site.</p><p>With respect to physical storage, each database is stored in
a single file. That is, all database objects that comprise an
individual database (views, triggers, indexes, tables, schema and
so on) reside together in one file that defines an SQLite database.
Database files are made up of uniformly sized pages. Page size is
set upon database creation, and valid sizes range from 512b-4Gb. By
default, SQLite uses a 1Kb page size, which seems to offer the best
overall performance.</p><p>Transactions are implemented using a second file called the
journal, which only exists when there is one or more active
connections to the database. Each database has exactly one journal
file. It holds the original (unmodified) pages that were changed in
the course of a transaction. When the transaction commits, the
journal pages are no longer needed and are summarily discarded.
Rollbacks are performed by restoring pages from the journal file to
the database file. The use of the journal file ensures that the
database always can survive a crash and be restored to a consistent
state. The first client to connect to a database after a crash
triggers a rollback of the previous transaction. Specifically, when
the client connects, SQLite tries to create a new journal file,
only to find that a previous one exists. When this happens, it
infers a crash must have occurred and proceeds to copy the contents
of the old journal file back into the database, effectively
restoring it to its original state before the crash. Then it gives
the client the go-ahead to start working.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe29580.0xf21d40"></a>Simple API, Many Languages</h2></div></div><p>SQLite has an extremely easy-to-use API that requires only
three functions with which to execute SQL and retrieve data. It is
extensible, allowing the programmer to define custom functions and
aggregates in the form of C callbacks. The C API is the foundation
for the scripting interfaces, one of which (the Tcl interface)
comes included in the distribution. The Open Source community has
developed a large number of other client interfaces, adapters and
drivers that make it possible to use SQLite in other languages and
libraries.</p><p>Using the C API requires only three steps. Basically, you
call sqlite_open() to connect to a database, in which you provide
the filename and access mode. Then, you implement a callback
function, which SQLite calls for each record it retrieves from the
database. Next, call sqlite_exec(), providing a string containing
the SQL you want to execute and a pointer to your callback
function. Besides checking for error codes, that's it. A basic
example is illustrated in Listing 2.</p><p><a href="6650l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Basic C API
Example</a></p><p>One of the nice things about this model that differs from
other database client libraries is the callback function. Unlike
the other client APIs where you wait for the result set, SQLite
places you right in the middle of the result-gathering process, in
the thick of things as they happen. Therefore, you play a more
active role in fetching data and directly influence the retrieval
process. You can aggregate data as you collect it or abort record
retrieval if you want. The point is, because the database is
embedded, your application is essentially as much the server as it
is the client, and SQLite takes full advantage of this through the
use of its callback interface.</p><p>In addition to the standard C API, an extended API makes it
even easier to fetch records, using sqlite_get_table(), which does
not require a callback function. This function behaves more like
traditional client libraries, taking SQL and returning a rowset.
Some of the features of the extended API are functions to extend
SQL by adding your own functions and aggregates, which is addressed
later in this article.</p><p>Finally, if for some reason you need an ODBC interface, I am
pleased to inform you that one is available, written by Christian
Werner. His ODBC driver can be found at
<a href="http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc" target="_self">www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe29580.0xf220b0"></a>Auto-increment Columns</h2></div></div><p>While SQLite does not support sequences per se, it does have
an auto-increment key and the equivalent of MySQL is
mysql_insert_id(). A primary key can be set to auto-increment by
declaring it INTEGER PRIMARY KEY. The value of the last inserted
record for that field is obtained by calling
sqlite_last_insert_rowid().</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe29580.0xf221b8"></a>BLOBs</h2></div></div><p>You can store binary data in SQLite columns with the
restriction that it only stores up to the first NULL character. In
order to store binary data, you must first encode it. One
possibility is URL-style encoding; another is base64. If you have
no particular preference, SQLite makes life easy for you through
two utility functions: sqlite_encode_binary() and
sqlite_decode_binary().</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe29580.0xf222c0"></a>Thread Safety</h2></div></div><p>SQLite is as threadsafe as you are. The answer more or less
centers around the SQLite connection handle returned by
sqlite_open(). This is what should not be shared between execution
contexts; each thread should get its own. If you still want threads
to share it, protect it with a mutex. Likewise, connection handles
should not be shared across UNIX fork() calls. This is more common
sense than anything else. Bottom line: thread or process, get your
own connection handle, and everything should be fine.</p><p>SQLite uses the concept of a pragma to control runtime
behavior. Pragmas are parameters that are set using SQL syntax.
There are pragmas for performance tuning, such as setting the cache
size and whether to use synchronous writes. There are some for
debugging, like tracing the parser and the VDBE, and others still
are for controlling the amount of information passed to client
callback functions. Some pragmas have options to control their
scope, having one variant that lasts only as long the current
session and another that takes effect permanently.</p><p>SQLite sorts a column lexigraphically if, and only if, that
column is declared as type BLOB, CHAR, CLOB or TEXT. Otherwise, it
sorts numerically. SQLite used to make decisions on how to sort a
column solely by its value. If it &ldquo;looked&rdquo; like a number, then it
was sorted numerically, otherwise lexigraphically. A tremendous
amount of discussion about this appeared on the mailing list, and
it eventually was refined to the rules it uses today, which allow
you to control the method of comparison by the declared type in the
schema.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe29580.0xf22478"></a>Scripting Interfaces</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned earlier, many client interfaces have been
developed for SQLite. To give you a taste, a Python version of the
previous C example is illustrated in Listing 3, and its Perl
counterpart is shown in Listing 4. It doesn't get any easier.
SQLite also can be used from the shell, which makes it amenable to
system administration tasks. A shell version of our stock example
is provided in Listing 5.</p><p><a href="6650l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Python

Example</a></p><p>Finally, because I am not a Java, Tcl, Ruby, Delphi, Lua,
Objective C, PHP, Visual Basic, .NET, Mono, DBExpress, wxWindows,
Euphoria or REXX programmer, I will have to refer the likes of you
who are, to the SQLite Wiki to find your respective interfaces. See
<a href="http://cvs.hwaci.com:2080/sqlite/wiki?p=SqliteWrappers" target="_self">cvs.hwaci.com:2080/sqlite/wiki?p=SqliteWrappers</a>
for your preferred way to talk to SQLite.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe29580.0xf22840"></a>Extending SQLite</h2></div></div><p>SQLite includes a nice C framework in which to create your
own functions and aggregates that can be called from SQL. Some
wrappers, such as the Python wrapper, allow you to use this feature
to implement them in the extension's language. SQL, such as
<b  >INSERT INTO orders purchase_date values
CURRENT_TIME()</b>, is a simple matter of writing a callback
function that looks something like Listing 6. Then, register the
function and use it as shown in Listing 7.</p><p><a href="6650l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6. Implementation of
CURRENT_TIME()</a></p><p><a href="6650l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7. Using
CURRENT_TIME()</a></p><p>All of SQLite's built-in functions, such as avg(), min(),
max() and sum(), with the exception of the magical typeof(), are
implemented using this API. User-defined aggregates can be added
just as easily. Doing something like <b  >SELECT variance(age)
from population</b> uses a very similar approach to creating
functions. This, however, is left as an exercise for the reader.
Hint: the file func.c includes some excellent examples. Like
functions, SQLite uses the API to implement its aggregates as
well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe29580.0xf22bb0"></a>Administration</h2></div></div><p>For administration, SQLite offers an intuitive utility
program conveniently named sqlite with which users of MySQL and
PostgreSQL will feel perfectly at home. It has both shell and
command-line modes. Within the shell, you can view a database's
tables, schema and indexes, as well as execute SQL on the command
line and in external files. It also has some nice modes for viewing
data and VDBE output.</p><p>Though loading and unloading data can be done within the
shell, it is even easier on the command line. Given a file
containing valid DDL/DML (call it dump.sql), you can load it into a
database (call it db), like so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sqlite db &lt; dump.sql
</pre><p>This creates the database db if it doesn't exit. The reverse
process to dump a database would be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
sqlite db .dump &gt; dump.sql
</pre>


SQLite is powerful. Its wide application, ease of use, portability,
speed, scalability, small footprint and clean code base make it a
library that all programmers should have in their arsenals. And
given its license, there is simply no reason not to. The SQLite
Project is always looking for new users and developers, and it
welcomes new ideas and engaging discussion. I hope you enjoy
learning about and using it as much as I have.
