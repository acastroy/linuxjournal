I'm considering renewing my subscription. My main problem with the magazine
is that the digital format is not set up for digital devices. Digital
devices do not have letter page size and do not have 600dpi resolution,
and many laptops do not have a portrait aspect ratio. What does this mean?
Well, in order to view a page, you have to zoom in. Once zoomed in, you
have to scroll up and down to view a single page. That is annoying. Compare
it with the Web. You start at the top and scroll down because most Web
pages are single-column text. They are digitally ergonomic, whereas your
magazine's
PDF is not. Please, I beg you, fix it by going to a single-column PDF or,
better yet a, downloadable HTML .tgz. HTML would allow readers to set the
single-column size to what works best for their devices.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mark Ramsell  <br><br>

The main PDF has changed slightly since the digital transition. It
&ldquo;fits&rdquo; on a
tablet-size screen better. Laptops, I agree, don't lend themselves to reading
a portrait document very well. In that case, I recommend using an EPUB
reader, which allows for flowing text (a couple issues ago I wrote about a
great Firefox plugin that does it). Otherwise, the interactive on-line version
of the magazine formats as a two-page spread, which looks good on a computer
screen. Hopefully, one of those formats will work well for you. The good news
is they're all included with your subscription!&mdash;Ed.

Digital Library</h4><p>
I have to admit, I am quite messy at keeping track of stuff, and things
that have been added to my list of untrackable stuff are e-books. I have an
old Android tablet, a new Android phone, a laptop with Windows 7/OpenSUSE
12.1 and three more PCs that I usually work on. That's a lot of devices, and
because of this, except for my work PC, I don't spend a lot of time at any
given device. I think the PDF and .mobi formats are great for e-books like the
magazine; however, it takes precious time to find the last page
that I read. I am currently using Dropbox to share the files between all
the computers, but I can't help wondering if there is a better way to
do it and keep the reading progress tracked. 
</p><p>
I like to read on my regular
PC because of the bigger monitor, but I rarely have time at work (I read
when I need to wind down), but when I am waiting for something, I can read
on my phone. Before going to bed, the tablet is great. At the moment, I am
reading different things in each device, because I don't feel like wasting
time searching for the last spot that I was on.
I figure I am not the only one; other people must have encountered this
problem.
Keep up the good job!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
David   <br><br>
</p><p>
David, I have the same issue with e-books&mdash;not just <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, but my
entire collection. For something I want to read cover to cover (and keep
my place), I find the Kindle reader to do a nice job. You can upload the .mobi
version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> to your Kindle account as a personal document, and it
will use WhisperSync to keep your spot on multiple devices. The only thing
that frustrates me is that personal documents can't be read with the cloud reader,
so reading on my screen isn't possible yet. Hopefully Amazon will lift that
restriction!&mdash;Ed.

Downloading PDFs via Python</h4><p>
Thanks for the digital edition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>!
It's really nice to have full-text search on all the issues, thanks to our
usual desktop search tools.
</p><p>
The other day I wanted to download all the back issues for my archives on a new PC,
so got an old Python script and edited it to download them, as an
alternative to wget's black magic. Also, it's easy to edit it to get only the
latest issue and run in a cron job.
</p><p>
You can get it here, if you want; it's far from perfect, but it works:
<a href="http://gerlos.altervista.org/files/dljget.py" target="_self">gerlos.altervista.org/files/dljget.py</a>.
Obviously, it needs to be edited: you need to put your download
page link and the download path in the script.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
gerlos   <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks gerlos! This is exactly what many of us have been hoping for. The
script works well, and it's easily modifiable for .epub or .mobi. gerlos is
officially hero of the day! (Note: you need to make sure you have
the python-bs4 package installed. Also, to find your variables, click through
to your download page and look in the address field. You'll find your personal
link information to put into the script.)&mdash;Ed.

Stop Cheating, Dave!</h4><p>
I'm finding all of Dave Taylor's shell scripts for cheating at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words with Friends</em></span> and so
on to be tiresome. Normally I'd be
interested, but he's gone on about this ever since I renewed my
subscription a few months ago! 
</p><p>
I must admit, part of my blas&eacute; stems from
the fact that I solved this problem more than five years ago for a different
word game: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Jumble</em></span>, a syndicated newspaper word/riddle game I loved to play
as a child. I was bored at my tech support job (with restricted Internet
access), and someone gave me an entire illustrated book of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Jumble</em></span>.
Rather than work the entire book manually, I wrote a series of Bourne shell
scripts to solve it on a SCO UNIX system. All I had was SCO's man pages,
aspell and a very limited vi. It took me a few weeks, but I was able to get
it to the point where I could solve the entire book in about ten minutes.
</p><p>
So when reading Dave's column, I see that he's gone deeper than I did
(granted, I had a much simpler, one-player game). In my case, I don't call
it cheating. Scripting the problem means you never have to solve it again!
</p><p>
Will we see a different topic next month?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Trey Blancher  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> ayup. I was ready to move on too and have
done so (starting with my column in the July 2012 issue).
</p><p>
I will say this, however. If you have some great ideas about big, complex
scripts I could work on, I'd be very interested in hearing about them.
Sometimes I can rather get at a loss for a topic when my column's due, so if
you've got ideas or problems you face, do share!

E-Reader Downloads</h4><p>
To Dave Heebner [see Dave's letter regarding downloading issues on his NOOK in
the June 2012 issue]:
after I download an issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, I open &ldquo;My
Stuff&rdquo; in NOOK for PCs and use
the &ldquo;add new item&rdquo; at the top of the page to copy the item from downloads.

</p><p>
Awesome! It's nice when things &ldquo;just work&rdquo; like they're supposed to.&mdash;Ed.

Esoteric...Hmmm...</h4><p>
Greg commented in the June 2012 issue that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> had become a bit
esoteric with the subjects covered recently. I'm a very recent two-year
subscriber, and I must say that I echoed Greg's impression when I previewed
a few past issues. I made a two-year subscription in spite of my initial
impression because I was certain that it was a passing thing and that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
eventually would cover more general and practical topics. A Bluetooth
proximity device that locks and unlocks my computer when I leave and return
is pretty incredibly cool, I admit, but not too practical. A wall-mounted,
dual-monitor PC is also pretty cool. But practical? Don't get me wrong,
there is nothing at all wrong with the esoteric, but let's not exclude the
more common&mdash;something for the intermediate reader: an article on Udev and the
many gotchas involved in manual configuration; Calibre, and what it can do;
using notify-send to set up your own notifications; Flexget for automating
torrent downloads. There is a trove of topics that would be beneficial to
a very broad slice of your readership. I'd even be willing to write a few
articles myself, if that would help. Love the magazine as a whole, just hoping
for something a notch or two closer to home.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Slurry   <br><br>
</p><p>
It's an admittedly strange game trying to get just the right balance of
articles to make everyone equally happy (or equally frustrated I suppose). We
have a group of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers on our advisory board, and we run ideas
past them every issue. We are <span   class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> up for new writers, so if you'd like to
send an article idea, we'd love to hear it.
See <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/author" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/author</a> for more information.

Substandard Working the Shell</h4><p>
Dave Taylor's Work the Shell column is far less useful than it could be. This
is not <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX
Journal</em></span>. This is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. As such, the shell that people use is bash,
not the Bourne shell. I just don't understand why every example is based on
a 20-year-old shell that requires that every single thing can 
occur only by running external processes. Let's look at a few examples from the
current issue:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ ! -z "$2" ] ...
</pre>
</p><p>
vs.:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [[ -n "$2" ]] ...
</pre>
</p><p>
vs.:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[[ -z "$2" ]] || targetLength="$2"
</pre>
</p><p>
For the record, I'd rather see people getting educated on what the
difference is between use of single vs. double square brackets.
</p><p>
Here's another:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for word in $(cat $possibilities)
do
   length=$(echo $word | wc --c)
   length="$(( $length - 1 ))"  # Why the dbl quotes?
</pre>
</p><p>
vs.:

<pre     class="programlisting">

for word in $(&lt; $possibilities)
do
   length=$(( ${#word} - 1 ))

</pre>
</p><p>
A few processes were saved. Who cares? The people who go into a job
interview and demonstrate how little they know and how sloppy they are at
not bothering to learn <span   class="emphasis"><em>properly</em></span> the language in which they are being paid
to write. Besides that, there are lots of bad &gt;10K LOC scripts out there
that get buried under the sheer weight of the excess processes.
</p><p>
One last one:

<pre     class="programlisting">
uword=$(echo $word | tr '[[:lower:]]' '[[:upper:]]')
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure, using a bash4 feature might be pushing my luck because of all those
people out there who are still(?) using an antique copy of bash. Maybe they
can't use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
uword="${word^^}"
</pre>
</p><p>
But, at the very least, they could use:

<pre     class="programlisting">

uword=$(tr '[[:lower:]]' '[[:upper:]]' &lt;&lt;&lt;$word)

</pre>
</p><p>
I won't even go into why a while loop is being used that has a start, a
termination value and an increment, when a for loop would be perfectly
lovely.
</p><p>
I do hope that this problem can be rectified since I see no reason why it
shouldn't.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Steven W. Orr  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> Thanks for your interesting note, Steve. I have old dog/new tricks syndrome
with the scripting I work off, so I have to say that I haven't seen the
<tt  >[[ ]]</tt>
notation before. I'm curious. I tend to work off the reference materials I
have on hand and the man pages: where are some of these newer scripting
capabilities documented so I can catch up on things?
</p><p>
I'll definitely hit on these topics in my next column, due July 1, so stay
tuned for it, and thanks again for taking the time to write.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>And, Steven replies to Dave:</b></span> You have to read the bash man page about 200 times.
</p><p>
There used to be a program in /bin or /usr/bin called test. For a while, that
program used to link to a file called [. After that, the test became built
in, and you'd have to go out of your way to invoke the external test program.
The [[ ]] construct is relatively new, around 20 years old or so. It started
with ksh88, and bash has had it for a very long time.
</p><p>
The differences are quite important:


<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -z "$foo" ] &amp;&amp; [ $(xxx; echo $?) -eq 0 ] || 
 &#8618;[ $(yyy; echo $?) -eq 0 ]
</pre>
</p><p>
will not do what you expect. It will test to see if $foo is null, and if it
is,
it will then run the xxx test and not the yyy test. If the foo test is false,
it will run the yyy test and not the xxx test.
</p><p>
The correct approach is:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if [[ -z "$foo" ]] &amp;&amp; {
       xxx || yyy
       }

</pre>
</p><p>
Note that double square brackets are not a built-in; they are a keyword.
</p><p>
Another example that will demonstrate things:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if [[ t1 &amp;&amp; t2 &amp;&amp; t3 ]]

</pre>
</p><p>
is not the same as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ t1 -a t2 -a t3 ]
</pre>

Multithreaded Simulation and OpenGL Visualization Demos</h4><p>
I am a long-term subscriber to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, and I have recently posted
the source code of two of my projects on GitHub. One is a lattice
simulation and the other an N-body simulation:
<a href="https://github.com/fhstoica/AbelianHiggs" target="_self">https://github.com/fhstoica/AbelianHiggs</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/fhstoica/N_Body_Simulation" target="_self">https://github.com/fhstoica/N_Body_Simulation</a>.
</p><p>
The code gives a good real-world example of highly parallelizable
computations making use of barrier synchronization and CPU affinity
(Linux-specific) to improve performance.
The visualization code implements the rendering of an isosurface using the
Mesa and GLUT libraries.
</p><p>
I would have liked to see such examples when I was learning multithreaded
and OpenGL programming, so I am trying to make them available to anyone
interested.
