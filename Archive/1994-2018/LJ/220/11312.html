You've probably never paid much attention to the aliases in your .bashrc,
but Dave has. In this column, he talks about aliases and command-line
functions as an easy way to expand your command-line options.

Let's take a side trip this month, a journey away from the busy
thoroughfare of shell script programming and into the relatively peaceful
eddy of shell aliases. You probably are thinking &ldquo;Yeah, that's two
paragraphs. Then what?&rdquo; But stick with me&mdash;there's a bit more to
aliases than you may have realized.
</p><p>
To start, you can see what system and shell aliases you have simply by typing
<tt  >alias</tt> on the command line:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ alias
alias adb='/home/taylor/Documents/Android\ SDK/platform-tools/adb'
alias grep='grep --color=always'
alias ksnap='/home/taylor/Documents/Android\ SDK/tools/ddms'
alias ls='ls -F'
alias scale='/home/taylor/bin/scale.sh'
alias vps='ssh taylor@intuitive.com'
</pre>
</p><p>
For the most part, these are straightforward substitutions of one word for
another. Type in <tt  >vps</tt>, and the shell expands that to be the command
<tt  >ssh taylor@intuitive.com</tt>.
</p><p>
Look at the alias for <tt  >ls</tt> though. You can start to see a
tiny bit of the sophistication that the shell has by realizing that it's
not an alias loop. I mean, <tt  >ls</tt> = <tt  >ls
-F</tt>, so shouldn't <tt  >ls -F</tt> expand
to <tt  >ls ls -F -F</tt>, and so on? Fortunately, it doesn't, and
that's one reason you easily can tweak and expand your command-line
capabilities with aliases.
</p><p>
In fact, my sequence is often: type in the command until it's complex
enough for an alias, which works until it's sufficiently complex for a
shell script.
</p><p>
Let me show you a handy trick by demonstrating how I'd turn a complex
<tt  >find</tt> command into an alias:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -name "*core*" -print
</pre>
</p><p>
Now let me use a shell shortcut, <tt  >!!</tt>, for the most recent command I've
typed in within a more-complicated sequence:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "alias findcore=\"!!\"" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
</pre>
</p><p>
There's no feedback, so what did it actually do? To find out,
examine the last line of the .bashrc:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tail -1 ~/.bashrc
alias findcore="find . -name *core* -print"
</pre>
</p><p>
Nice. Easy. When your alias has become sufficiently complicated that a shell
script would be easier, you can do the same basic thing again:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ alias findcore &gt; findcore.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, if you're really organized like I am, perhaps you could put the
script into your ~/bin directory, which changes the last line to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ alias findcore &gt; ~/bin/findcore.sh
$ vi !$
</pre>
</p><p>
There's another shell shortcut for you: <tt  >!$</tt> is the last word of the
previous command&mdash;in this case, it'll be the filename you just created.
Bash actually has a ton of handy little shortcuts like that, and they're
doubly useful if you have complex directory names and filenames!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1965580.0x1a5dfb8"></a>
Complicated Aliases</h2></div></div><p>
The most common problem with an alias is that you want to be able to have the
alias process the arguments you've specified, but not just automatically
at the end of the command sequence. For the <tt  >ls</tt> alias above,
it's no big deal, but what if you wanted to have something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias ls="ls -F | tee -a ~/ls.log"
</pre>
</p><p>
This would let you have a running log of all output from the
<tt  >ls</tt>
command. The alias works fine until you invoke it with something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls /home
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1965580.0x1a5e278"></a></h2></div></div><p>
in which case it's expanded to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -F | tee -a ~/ls.log /home
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1965580.0x1a5e3d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That's going to generate an error.
</p><p>
To get this to work, you need to switch from an alias to a shell function.
It's not
too common on the command line, but quite reasonable for your
.bashrc.
Here's how I'd write it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
list() {
   ls -F $* | tee -a ~/ls.log
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Experimentation reveals that you can shrink things down to a minimum of two
lines, but no shorter. So, do something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
list() { ls -F $* | tee -a ~/ls.log }
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1965580.0x1a5e640"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the shell will give you the secondary prompt (usually
<tt  >&gt;</tt>)
waiting for the closing curly brace. Because you're going to drop this into
the .bashrc, it doesn't really matter much.
</p><p>
Let's do some more interesting things with these functions, fancier
aliases that demonstrate a bit of the power of these command-line functions.
</p><p>
First off, convert to uppercase:

<pre     class="programlisting">
upper() {
   echo $1 | tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]'
}
</pre>
</p><p>
That looks good, but there's a flaw in this function. Can you see it? The
problem is that if I use <tt  >$1</tt>, I don't get multiword input:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ upper linux journal rocks
LINUX
</pre>
</p><p>
Oops. It's easily fixed by substituting <tt  >$*</tt> instead. While
I'm at it
though, let's use defined letter groups and sets rather than explicit
ranges:

<pre     class="programlisting">
upper() {
   echo $* | tr '[[:lower:]]' '[[:upper:]]'
}

$ upper linux journal rocks
LINUX JOURNAL ROCKS
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1965580.0x1a5eab8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That's better.
</p><p>
A very nice feature of most modern Linux systems is a change directory
command pair called <tt  >pushd</tt> and
<tt  >popd</tt>. Use <tt  >pushd</tt> instead
of <tt  >cd</tt> to change your current working directory, and the system will remember
where you were. Do a quick <tt  >popd</tt>, and you're back.
That's helpful when you're
bouncing around the filesystem, but what if you don't have these
available?
</p><p>
Implementing a similar directory stack in a couple command functions is
actually straightforward. Here's my version:

<pre     class="programlisting">
push() {
   current=$(pwd)
   cd $1 ; echo "Moved to $1"; ls -CF
}

pop() {
   echo "Moving back to $current"
   cd $current
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's give it a shot:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ push $HOME
Moved to /home/taylor
Desktop/        Dropbox/        Movies/        Presentations/
Documents/      Google Drive/   Music/         Public/
Downloads/      Library/        Pictures/      Sites/
</pre>
</p><p>
What's happened to the &ldquo;current&rdquo; shared variable? Let's have
a look:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo $current
/home/taylor/Desktop
</pre>
</p><p>
To switch back to the previous working directory, therefore, all that's
needed is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ pop
Moving back to /home/taylor/Desktop
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1965580.0x1e57390"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That's easy!
</p><p>
To make this more sophisticated, you would need to use an array of directory names
and keep track of your array depth. It's not too difficult, but I'll leave that
one for an enthused reader!
</p><p>
One big difference between aliases and functions, I should note, is that you
can use an alias with the same name as a command, but most shells complain
about attempts to define a function where the name collides with an alias:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls() {
-bash: syntax error near unexpected token '('
$ unalias ls
$ ls() {
   echo "file listing disabled"
}
$ ls /
file listing disabled
</pre>
</p><p>
Sneaky, isn't it? You can imagine how you really
could make some changes to
how the Linux command line works for an unsuspecting colleague, but perhaps
you should leave that for when a new person joins your team and you feel the
need for some hazing.
</p><p>
Anyway, that's it for aliases and command-line functions this time. I
encourage you to explore and experiment with what you can do in your
.bashrc to make your command-line interaction more pleasant and
efficient.
