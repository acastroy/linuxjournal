If you've ever worried about your data in the cloud or wished backups
were easier to automate, the high-security, command-line-friendly approach
of Tarsnap backups might make you rest a lot easier at night.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1807580.0x18ff1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Storing backups in the cloud requires a level of trust that not everyone
is willing to give. While the convenience and low cost of automated,
off-site backups is very compelling, the reality of putting personal data
in the hands of complete strangers will never sit quite right with
some people.
</p><p>
Enter Tarsnap&mdash;&ldquo;on-line backups for the truly paranoid&rdquo;. Tarsnap is the
brainchild of Dr Colin Percival, a former FreeBSD Security Officer.
In 2006, he began research and development on a new solution for
&ldquo;encrypted, snapshotted remote backups&rdquo;, culminating in the release of
Tarsnap in 2008.
</p><p>
Unlike other on-line backup solutions, Tarsnap uses an open, documented
cryptographic design that securely encrypts your files. Rather than
trusting a vendor's cryptographic claims, you have full access to
the source code, which uses open-source libraries and industry-vetted
protocols, such as RSA, AES and SHA.
</p><p>
Tarsnap provides a command-line client that operates very much like
the traditional UNIX tar command. Familiar syntax, such as <tt  >tarsnap
cf</tt> and <tt  >tarsnap xvf</tt> works as users would expect, except that instead
of manipulating local tarballs, the client is working with cloud-based
archives. These archives are stored on Amazon S3 with EC2 servers to
handle client connections. To minimize bandwidth costs, Tarsnap uses
smart rsync-like block-oriented snapshot operations that upload
only data set changes and minimize transmission costs.
</p><p>
Although you could roll your own backup system by encrypting your data,
running an rsync server off-site and so on, Tarsnap's scriptability,
professional cryptographic design and utility pricing make it an
attractive service for clueful users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1807580.0x18ff6c8"></a>
Open-Source Strong Crypto</h2></div></div><p>
Tarsnap compresses, encrypts and cryptographically signs every byte
you send to it. No knowledge of cryptographic protocols is required,
but if you are an interested enthusiast or feel more comfortable if you
can look under the hood, you'll find the source code and full design
thoroughly documented on <a href="http://tarsnap.com" target="_self">tarsnap.com</a>.
</p><p>
During installation, the user creates a keyfile, which optionally
can be passphrase-protected. The file contains two 2048-bit RSA keys for
signing and encryption. AES-256 session keys are created at runtime
and encrypted with the RSA keys. The HMAC-SHA-256 hash function is used
to verify data blocks and prevent tampering, and the same hash function
is used elsewhere to verify communication between the client and server.
</p><p>
If those cryptographic terms make your eyes glaze over, the simple
description is that Tarsnap encrypts and verifies your data in motion
and at rest using industry-standard protocols. From a user perspective,
the only thing that needs to be safeguarded is the keyfile. As you might
expect, if it's lost, the keys to decrypt data stored with Tarsnap
are unavailable and your data is no longer usable. After generation,
this keyfile ideally should be stored securely off-site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1807580.0x18ff8d8"></a>
Efficient Design</h2></div></div><p>
Tarsnap backs up variable-length, deduplicated blocks of data. This means
that if you change one file in a directory, only that file is backed up.
Indeed, only the changes to that file are backed up if the file previously
existed. If you move files around, Tarsnap is smart enough to recognize
and skip previously backed-up blocks. Anytime you wish, you can take a
backup of a directory, which creates a new archive. Behind the scenes,
Tarsnap will retain whatever files are necessary to make that archive
whole.
</p><p>
Suppose you have a directory with 100MB of files and a 10% daily change
rate. If you create a Tarsnap archive every day of that directory,
you will see the following consumption pattern:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Monday (initial): 100MB archive created (100MB uploaded, 100MB stored).
</p></li><li><p>
Tuesday: 10MB archive created (10MB new data uploaded, 110MB total data
stored).
</p></li><li><p>
Wednesday: 10MB archive created (10MB new data uploaded, 120MB total data
stored).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If on Thursday you delete the Monday archive, the Tuesday archive will
be &ldquo;made whole&rdquo; by retaining whatever files from Monday are needed.
This gives you tremendous flexibility to pick restore points. Of course,
you can keep multiple archives with however many restore points you wish.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1807580.0x18ffd50"></a>
Your Current Account Balance Is $4.992238237884881224</h2></div></div><p>
Tarsnap works on a prepaid utility-metered model. Subscribers deposit
a minimum of $5.00 and are charged only for the storage and bandwidth
they consume. Although the cost is higher than plain Amazon S3 service,
it reflects both the cryptographic, compression and deduplication
value-add of Tarsnap. At the time of this writing, Tarsnap costs 30 cents per
gigabyte-month for storage and 30 cents per gigabyte transmitted.
</p><p>
This cost may make Tarsnap infeasible for large, whole-server
terabyte-size backups. However, it is ideal for critical, sensitive
files that must be durable, available and safe in the event an attacker
succeeded in compromising them. With no minimum charge or monthly
fees, Tarsnap is very economical for small data sets or for data that
compresses well. Some examples:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Backing up 100MB of files with 10% daily change rate for a month would cost
only 30 cents.
</p></li><li><p>
A gigabyte that is backed up weekly with a 20% change rate would cost $1.40
a month.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Tarsnap bills based on attodollars (quintillionths of a dollar) to avoid
profiting through rounding. This means your account balance is tracked
to 18 decimal places. This is not just &ldquo;pay by the drink&rdquo; cloud
pricing&mdash;it's practically &ldquo;pay by the atom&rdquo;. Some users find that a
small deposit lasts them months or years.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1807580.0x19001c8"></a>
Important Flexibility</h2></div></div><p>
One of Tarsnap's best features is how easy it is to script.
The ability to put a <tt  >tarsnap cf</tt> command into a shell script makes
use in cron jobs very straightforward, which encourages unattended,
automated backups&mdash;the best kind.
</p><p>
Crucially, Tarsnap also supports a division of responsibilities. You can
use the tarsnap-keymgmt tool to create keyfiles with limited authority.
You may have one keyfile that lives on your server with permission to
create archives, but not the authority to delete them. A master key
with full privileges could be kept off-site, so that if attackers were to
compromise your server, they would be unable to destroy your backups.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1807580.0x1900380"></a>
Using Tarsnap</h2></div></div><p>
To get started with Tarsnap, register at tarsnap.com, deposit some funds
into your account, and download the client.
</p><p>
The client is available only as source, but the straightforward
<tt  >./configure ; make install</tt> process is very easy. The client is
supported on all major Linux distributions (as well as BSD-based systems).
Take a quick peek at the download page to make sure you have the required
operating system packages, as some of the development packages are not
installed in typical Linux configurations.
</p><p>
If you are using a firewall, be aware that Tarsnap communicates via TCP
on port 9279.
</p><p>
There are only two critical configuration items: the location of your
keyfile and the location of your Tarsnap cache. Both are set in
/usr/local/etc/tarsnap.conf. A tarsnap.conf.example is provided, and you
probably can just copy the example as is. It defines your Tarsnap key as
/root/tarsnap.key and your cache directory as /usr/local/tarsnap-cache,
which will be created if it doesn't exist. The cachedir is a small
state-tracking directory that lets Tarsnap keep track of backups.
</p><p>
Next, register your machine as follows. In this case, I'm setting up
Tarsnap service for a machine called helicarrier. The e-mail address and
password are the ones I used when I signed up for service with Tarsnap:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# tarsnap-keygen --keyfile /root/tarsnap.key 
 &#8618;--user andrew@fabbro.org --machine helicarrier
Enter tarsnap account password:
#
</pre>
</p><p>
I have a directory I'd like to back up with Tarsnap:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# ls -l /docs
total 2092
-rw-rw---- 1 andrew 1833222 Jun 14 16:38 2011 Tax Return.pdf
-rw------- 1 andrew 48568 Jun 14 16:41 andrew_passwords.psafe3
-rw------- 1 tina   14271 Jun 14 16:42 tina_passwords.psafe3
-rw-rw-r-- 1 andrew 48128 Jun 14 16:41 vacation_hotels.doc
-rw-rw-r-- 1 andrew 46014 Jun 14 16:35 vacation_notes.doc
-rw-rw-r-- 1 andrew 134959 Jun 14 16:44 vacation_reservation.pdf
</pre>
</p><p>
To back up, I just tell Tarsnap what name I want to call my archive
(&ldquo;docs.20120701&rdquo; in this case) and which directory to back up.
There's
no requirement to use a date string in the archive name, but it makes
versioning straightforward, as you'll see:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# tarsnap cf docs.20120701 /docs
tarsnap: Removing leading '/' from member names
                                 Total size  Compressed size
All archives                        2132325          1815898
  (unique data)                     2132325          1815898
This archive                        2132325          1815898
New data                            2132325          1815898
</pre>
</p><p>
In my tarsnap.conf, I enabled the <tt  >print-stats</tt> directive, which gives
the account report shown. Note the compression, which reduces storage
costs and improves cryptographic security. The &ldquo;compressed
size&rdquo; of the
&ldquo;unique data&rdquo; shows how much data is actually stored at
Tarsnap, and you
pay only for the compressed size.
</p><p>
The next day, I back up docs again to &ldquo;docs.20120702&rdquo;. If I
haven't
made many changes, the backup will proceed very quickly and use little
additional space:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# tarsnap cf docs.20120702 /docs
tarsnap: Removing leading '/' from member names
                                 Total size  Compressed size
All archives                        4264650          3631796
  (unique data)                     2132770          1816935
This archive                        2132325          1815898
New data                                445             1037
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, although the amount of data for &ldquo;all archives&rdquo; has grown,
the actual amount of &ldquo;unique data&rdquo; has barely increased. Tarsnap is
smart enough to avoid backing up data that has not changed.
</p><p>
Now let's list the archives Tarsnap has stored:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# tarsnap --list-archives
docs.20120701
docs.20120702
</pre>
</p><p>
To demonstrate Tarsnap's smart approach to storage further, I will delete
the oldest backup:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# tarsnap df docs.20120701
                                 Total size  Compressed size
All archives                        2132325          1815898
  (unique data)                     2132325          1815898
This archive                        2132325          1815898
Deleted data                            445             1037
</pre>
</p><p>
The &ldquo;all archives&rdquo; number has dropped because now I have only one archive,
but the &ldquo;unique data&rdquo; has not changed much because it is still retaining
all files necessary to satisfy my &ldquo;docs.20120702&rdquo; archive. If I list it,
I can see my data is still there:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# tarsnap tvf docs.20120702
drwxrwxr-x  0 andrew 0 Jun 14 20:52 docs/
-rw-------  0 andrew 48568 Jun 14 16:41 docs/andrew_passwords.psafe3
-rw-rw-r--  0 andrew 46014 Jun 14 16:35 docs/vacation_notes.doc
-rw-rw-r--  0 andrew 134959 Jun 14 16:44 docs/vacation_reservation.pdf
-rw-rw-r--  0 andrew 48128 Jun 14 16:41 docs/vacation_hotels.doc
-rw-------  0 tina   14271 Jun 14 16:42 docs/tina_passwords.psafe3
-rw-rw----  0 andrew 1833222 Jun 14 16:38 docs/2011 Tax Return.pdf
</pre>
</p><p>
I use a date string for convenient versioning, but I could just as
easily use any naming convention for the archive, such as
&ldquo;docs.1&rdquo;,
&ldquo;docs.2&rdquo; and so on. For my personal backups, I have a cron job
that invokes
Tarsnap nightly with a date-string-named archive:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tarsnap cf docs.`date '%+Y%m%d'` /docs
</pre>
</p><p>
If I have a local calamity and want to restore that data, it is just
another simple Tarsnap command to get my files back. Note that like
traditional tar, Tarsnap removes the leading slash so all files are
restored relative to the current working directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /
# rm -rf docs
# tarsnap xvf docs.20120702
x docs/
x docs/andrew_passwords.psafe3
x docs/vacation_notes.doc
x docs/vacation_reservation.pdf
x docs/vacation_hotels.doc
x docs/tina_passwords.psafe3
x docs/2011 Tax Return.pdf
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1807580.0x1cf95a0"></a>
Tips</h2></div></div><p>
If you want to run Tarsnap as a nonroot user, create a .tarsnaprc file
in your home directory. The syntax is identical to the tarsnap.conf
discussed above. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat ~/tarsnap.conf
cachedir /home/andrew/tarsnap-cache
keyfile /home/andrew/tarsnap.key
print-stats
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have other services or users contending for your Internet
connection, use <tt  >--maxbw-rate</tt> to specify a maximum bytes per second
that Tarsnap will be allowed to use.
</p><p>
The <tt  >print-stats</tt> command gives you account status information when used
interactively, but for batch operations (such as running Tarsnap out
of cron), you can suppress the output by removing that directive
from your tarsnap.conf or by invoking Tarsnap with
<tt  >--no-print-stats</tt>.
</p><p>
Finally, you can play with the <tt  >--dry-run</tt> and
<tt  >-v</tt> flags to simulate Tarsnap
backup operations without actually burning network and disk. Once you've
got your command constructed exactly as you want it, remove
<tt  >--dry-run</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1807580.0x1cf9a18"></a>
License</h2></div></div><p>
Tarsnap is not distributed under an open-source license, although all
client source is provided (and compiled by the user during install).
However, the company regularly contributes back to projects whose code
it utilizes, such as libarchive. Tarsnap also has open-sourced some of
its own projects, including the scrypt package, the spiped secure pipe
d&aelig;mon and the kivaloo NoSQL data store.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1807580.0x1cf9b20"></a>
Further Information</h2></div></div><p>
The Tarsnap home page (<a href="http://tarsnap.com" target="_self">tarsnap.com</a>) has a wealth of documentation and
information, as well as links to the Tarsnap IRC channel, mailing list
and FAQ. The &ldquo;Technical Details&rdquo; section is absorbing reading for
those interested in the deep details of Tarsnap's cryptographic approach
and history.
</p><p>
Tarsnap also pays significant cash bounties for bugs found in the
product, ranging from a few dollars for small cosmetic bugs up to a
couple thousand dollars if someone finds a serious security flaw.
This transparent approach is further comfort for the truly paranoid.
</p><p>
Tarsnap's current version is 1.0.32, released on February 22, 2012, for
Linux, BSD, OS X, Solaris, Minix and Cygwin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1807580.0x1cf9d88"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Q&amp;A with Dr Colin Percival</b></p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Q. In May 2012, you retired as FreeBSD Security Officer to focus more
on Tarsnap. Sounds like Tarsnap is doing very well. Can you share any
stats on your growth to date?</em></span>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11304f1.large.jpg"><img src="11304f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Dr Colin Percival
</p></div></div><p>
A: I've heard &ldquo;startup company&rdquo; defined as &ldquo;time to double revenue or
the number of users is measured in months&rdquo;, and I've heard &ldquo;highly
successful startup company&rdquo; defined as &ldquo;time to double revenue or the
number of users is measured in weeks&rdquo;. By those definitions, Tarsnap
is a startup company, but not a highly successful one.
</p><p>
And yes, that is dodging the question, but Tarsnap is my primary source
of income, and I come from a culture that considers someone's income
to be a private matter, so I don't want to publish precise numbers.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Q. Looking at your Bug Bounties page, you've paid out more than $2,000 to users
who've submitted bug reports. Why a &ldquo;bug bounty&rdquo; system as opposed to
the traditional bug reporting in open-source projects?</em></span>
</p><p>
A: I gave a talk about this at BSDCan'12 and AusCERT'12 (in consecutive
weeks, no less&mdash;a word of advice, don't ever try to attend back-to-back
conferences 10,000 miles apart). In short, bug bounties help get more
people looking at code, and help encourage people to report anything
they see that seems wrong.
</p><p>
Probably a better question is why I offered bounties for all bugs
rather than just for security bugs&mdash;aside from Knuth's famous prizes,
I don't know of any other case where bounties extend beyond security
vulnerabilities. The answer here is roughly the same though&mdash;there's
a lot of people who won't look for security bugs because they don't
have a security background, but offering cash for <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> bugs gets them
interested...and my experience with FreeBSD is that many security
vulnerabilities aren't found by security people, but rather by other
developers just saying &ldquo;something here looks weird&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Q. What do you think are the weakest points of the Tarsnap design, from
a security perspective? Is there anything that should keep the truly
paranoid up at night?</em></span>
</p><p>
The weakest link in Tarsnap's security, without question, is me. I wrote
the Tarsnap client code to encrypt and sign everything on the client side,
but how do you know that it does what I claim?
</p><p>
If you're paranoid, you should look at the code yourself and make sure it
does what I claim it does. And when I release a new version, you should
look at that too&mdash;compare against the previous version and make sure
that the changes are sensible.
</p><p>
If the CIA kidnaps me and threatens to torture me until I decrypt
someone's data, I won't be able to do anything to help them. But if
the CIA kidnaps me and threatens to torture me unless I insert a Trojan
horse into the next version of Tarsnap...well, I'm not optimistic about
my ability to withstand torture.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Q. Tarsnap's client is very UNIX-nerd-friendly, with its
familiar tar syntax. Do you have any interest or plans for a graphical
interface for less-sophisticated users?</em></span>
</p><p>
A: This is absolutely something I plan on doing...in the future. I have
very little experience with anything GUI, so I'll probably end up paying
someone to produce a GUI&mdash;ideally an open-source GUI for tar, since
Tarsnap uses almost exactly the same command-line interface, and I think
a good GUI front end to tar would be useful for its own sake too.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Q. Why attodollars and not femtodollars or
zeptodollars?</em></span>
</p><p>
A: With attodollars, I can express everything as a pair of 64-bit integers.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Q. Do you have any new features in the works for upcoming Tarsnap
releases?</em></span>
</p><p>
A: I'm mostly working on performance improvements these days. There's a few
frequently requested features that I might add, but in general, there are
good reasons when features don't exist&mdash;either they're impossible
(for example, server-side expiration of old archives&mdash;the server has no way
to know which blocks should be freed when an old archive is deleted)
or would require a substantial redesign (for example, renaming
archives&mdash;the
client-server protocol has write transactions and delete transactions,
but renaming would need to atomically write some files and delete others).
