Want to improve the integrity of your data? Place constraints in the
database, as well as in your application.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a9580.0x25a1358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
NoSQL, the catchall phrase for non-relational databases, is all the
rage among Web developers. However, it's somewhat unfair and unhelpful to use
the term NoSQL to describe them, given the variety of technologies
involved. Even so, there are some fundamental differences between
traditional relational databases and their NoSQL counterparts. For
one, as the name implies, NoSQL databases don't use the standard SQL
query language, and use either their own SQL-like language (for example,
MongoDB) or an object-oriented API. Another difference is the
lack of two-dimensional tables; whereas SQL databases operate solely
with such tables, NoSQL databases eschew them in favor of name-value
pairs or hash-like objects. And finally, NoSQL databases typically
lack the features that led to the development of relational databases,
namely transactions and data integrity.
</p><p>
There's no doubt that the flexibility NoSQL databases offer is
attractive on a number of levels. Just as I enjoy working with
dynamic languages in which I don't have to declare my variables (or
their types) before I use them, it's nice to be able to store objects
in my database without having to define the object structure in
advance. If I want to add a new field to my Person object, I just do
so, and the database magically catches up.
</p><p>
At the same time, there are many cases when I want the database to
be tough with me and enforce the integrity of my data. That is, I
want to be sure that even if I have made a mistake in my application,
or if a user enters a value that shouldn't be allowed, the database
won't allow that bad data to be stored. And yes, I believe that it's
good to have such checks at the database level, rather than just at
the application level&mdash;not only because it provides an additional
guard against corrupt data, but also because the database often is accessed
directly, outside the application itself. I often have to do what
I refer to as &ldquo;database surgery&rdquo; on applications that are running for
my clients, and it's always reassuring to know I cannot make a
change manually that would corrupt the data.
</p><p>
Readers of this column know I'm a fan of both Ruby on Rails and
of PostgreSQL, and I often use them together on projects. However,
because Rails originally was developed under MySQL, which lacks many
of the data-integrity aspects of PostgreSQL, the standard Active
Record package fails to include such items as foreign keys in its base
implementation. This means that although Rails will support PostgreSQL
out of the box, it doesn't provide support for foreign keys, let alone
data-integrity checks.
</p><p>
So, in this article, I look at some Ruby gems that make it possible to
include foreign-key support in your Active Record models. I 
also describe ways you can take advantage of PostgreSQL's
CHECK mechanism to ensure that your data is as safe as possible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a9580.0x25a1720"></a>
Where Do You Check Your Data?</h2></div></div><p>
Before I go into the actual code and implementation, I admit
there are several philosophies of where and how to check your data. As
I mentioned previously, I prefer to have the data checked at both the database
and application levels, although sometimes I've been
lazy and used the default in Rails that does so only at the
application level.
</p><p>
Checking your data only at the application level is attractive in many
ways. It makes the implementation easier, and it often will work just
fine. It also, in the case of Rails, allows you to work in a single
language (that is, Ruby) and put the integrity checks in your model
files, where you're going to be using them.
</p><p>
But as I already said, if I have my checks only in the application,
it's quite possible that when I try to access the database from
outside my application, I'll end up messing things up, if only
accidentally. Now, I'll admit this is the way many Web
applications are designed, and it's not a fatal flaw. But it is
something that I'll try to avoid in this article.
</p><p>
It would be a bigger mistake to try to do things the other way
around&mdash;that is, to have the checks only in the database, rather than at
the application level. Imagine, for example, if you were to have a
&ldquo;NOT NULL&rdquo; constraint in the database, such that a particular column
could not contain a NULL value. If you didn't protect against such
things at the application layer, you might end up trying to put that
data into your database. And although the database itself would not be
corrupted, the application would generate an error, confusing and
frustrating users.
</p><p>
So, upsetting and annoying as it might be, the best way to do things 
probably is to duplicate some work&mdash;adding the constraints on the
database and then having them on the application as well. You could
argue that you should have the constraints in place in a third
location&mdash;in the HTML form the user often will use to submit information
to the server. Fortunately, there is at least one technique for
handling this sort of thing automatically. The client_side_validations
gem for Rails copies the validations as best as possible, putting
them into JavaScript within the user's views.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a9580.0x25a1a38"></a>
Foreign Keys</h2></div></div><p>
With this background, let's now assume that I want to implement a
simple appointment calendar. In order to implement my calendar, I
need to keep track of people (each of whom has a first name, a last
name, an e-mail address and a telephone number) and appointments
(which will indicate the date/time of the appointment, the person with
whom I'm meeting and a note about the meeting itself).
</p><p>
At the database level, the tables will be fairly straightforward.
This is how I would create the tables if I were doing so manually:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (
    id SERIAL,
    first_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT NOT NULL,
    phone TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);

CREATE TABLE Appointments (
    id SERIAL,
    person_id INTEGER REFERENCES People NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
</pre>
</p><p>
The important thing here, for the purposes of this discussion, is the
<tt  >REFERENCES People</tt> clause in the definition of the Appointments
table. With the REFERENCES clause in place, I can do the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO People (first_name, last_name, email, phone)
    VALUES ('Reuven', 'Lerner', 'reuven@lerner.co.il',
    &#8618;'847-230-9795');
INSERT INTO Appointments (person_id, notes) VALUES (1, 'Meet with
 &#8618;myself');
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, here's what happens if I try to delete myself from the People table:


<pre     class="programlisting">
atf=# DELETE FROM People WHERE id = 1;
ERROR:  update or delete on table "people" violates foreign key
constraint "appointments_person_id_fkey" on table "appointments"
DETAIL:  Key (id)=(1) is still referenced from table "appointments".
</pre>
</p><p>
Because Appointments.person_id is a foreign key to People.id, I
cannot remove a row from People if Appointments refers to it. This
sort of relational integrity is a great thing for my application. No
matter how you slice it, it means I cannot remove people from
the system if they are scheduled for an appointment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a9580.0x25a1eb0"></a>
Rails Integration</h2></div></div><p>
If these tables were part of a Web application that I was developing
in Ruby on Rails, I would use database migrations to create them. The
migrations would look something like this (if combined into a single
file):


<pre     class="programlisting">

class CreatePeopleAndAppointments &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration

  def change
    create_table :people do |t|
      t.string :first_name, :null =&gt; false
      t.string :last_name, :null =&gt; false
      t.string :email, :null =&gt; false
      t.string :phone, :null =&gt; false

      t.timestamps
    end

    create_table :appointments do |t|
      t.integer :person_id, :null =&gt; false
      t.text :notes, :null =&gt; false

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, this will give me the table definitions, but it won't give me
the foreign keys, meaning that I could corrupt the database by
deleting a single &ldquo;People&rdquo; record. In order to do that, at least in
the default Rails configuration, I need to use an &ldquo;execute&rdquo; command
in the migration to send explicit SQL to the database.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there is an easier way. The Foreigner gem, written by
Matthew Higgins, which works with MySQL as well as with PostgreSQL,
adds syntax to let you create and remove foreign keys within your
migrations. For example, with Foreigner active&mdash;putting it in the
Gemfile and then running <tt  >bundle install</tt>&mdash;I can add a new migration
that does the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class AddForeignKey &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    add_foreign_key :appointments, :people
  end

  def down
    remove_foreign_key :appointments, :people
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, after running this migration, I have the foreign key that
I was hoping for. Again, it's still important for me to have this
check in my Rails model; otherwise, I easily could get myself into a
situation that the database forbids but the model allows and, thus,
generate a bad error for my users.
</p><p>
Note: if you add the foreign key after you already have populated
the database with some data, you might run into trouble. That's
because PostgreSQL won't let you add a foreign key if one or more rows
fail to abide by the declared constraint. The NOT NULL constraint
additionally ensures that you point to <span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> person in the system. In
other words, every appointment has to be with someone, and it has to
be with someone in the People table.
</p><p>
Now, let's say you already have been working on a project, but
you have neglected to define foreign keys. You could go through
each table, figure out which is pointing to which, and then handle it
accordingly, adding the sorts of migrations shown above. But the
Immigrant gem (also written and released by Matthew Higgins) looks
at Rails models and adds foreign keys for every has_one and has_many
column that points to a belongs_to column in another model.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a9580.0x25a2430"></a>
Additional Checks</h2></div></div><p>
Foreigner is a great step forward, helping ensure the integrity of
your data. But there is another issue, more subtle than that of
foreign keys, to which I'm still susceptible. While I have ensured
that the person_id will not be NULL and will point to a record in the
People table, I haven't ensured that the People table will contain
valid and reasonable values. That is, although the first_name,
last_name, e-mail and phone columns will not contain NULLs, they might
contain empty strings or values (for example, e-mail addresses) that are
invalid.
</p><p>
At the database level, I could handle this sort of problem with a
CHECK clause. Such a clause ensures that illegal data&mdash;for whatever
&ldquo;illegal&rdquo; values I want to define&mdash;cannot be placed in the database.
This could be anything from a certain minimum or maximum length of
text string, to a pattern in the text, to minimum or maximum numbers.
For example, I often like to indicate that the database may not
contain a price lower than 0, and that e-mail addresses need to match
a very basic regular expression. (Note that matching e-mail addresses
is not for the faint of heart, at least if you want to do it
correctly.)
</p><p>
So given my People table, I could define a set of CHECK clauses that
would ensure that the first_name field is non-empty. In other words,
the first_name cannot be NULL, but it also cannot be the empty
string:


<pre     class="programlisting">

ALTER TABLE People ADD CONSTRAINT
    people_first_name_non_empty_chks CHECK (first_name &lt;&gt; '');

</pre>
</p><p>
Note that although I could add a number of checks within this single
constraint, I prefer not to do so. That gives me greater flexibility
to add and remove constraints, and it also ensures that when a constraint
is violated, PostgreSQL will accurately tell me which one it was.
</p><p>
Now, how can I implement this in my Rails migration, and do I want
to? My answer, as you can imagine, is that this would indeed be a
good thing to include in the database.
</p><p>
Once again, a Ruby gem comes to the rescue. This one,
sexy_pg_constraints, was written by Maxim Chernyak, but it has since forked and
is maintained by several other people.
</p><p>
I can include it in my Rails application by adding the following to
my Gemfile:


<pre     class="programlisting">
gem 'Empact-sexy_pg_constraints', :require =&gt; 'sexy_pg_constraints'
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a9580.0x25a2900"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and by uncommenting the following line in config/application.rb:

<pre     class="programlisting">
config.active_record.schema_format = :sql
</pre>
</p><p>
Simply put, sexy_pg_constraints adds a number of additional attributes
that you can pass to an add_column or change_column invocation within
your migration. For example, let's say I want to make sure, as
before, that the first_name column is never blank&mdash;neither NULL nor
the empty string. I can do this by saying:


<pre     class="programlisting">

class AddConstraints &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def up
    constrain :people, :first_name, :not_blank =&gt; true
  end

  def down
    deconstrain :people, :first_name
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
After I apply this migration, I discover the following in my table
definition:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"people_first_name_not_blank" CHECK 
 &#8618;(length(btrim(first_name::text)) &gt; 0)
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, I am checking to ensure that after removing all
whitespace from either side of the string, the length is greater than
0. Sounds like it worked to me!
</p><p>
sexy_pg_constraints comes with a large number of options, including
whitelisting, blacklisting, matching e-mail addresses and checking
the format of data. The only thing this gem is missing, by my
estimate, is a way to get the model file to communicate automatically
with the database and/or the migrations, so that you don't have to
add these in both places manually. Even so, by adding these
constraints, you improve the integrity of your data without having to go
too far out of the Rails migration framework.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Database constraints are there to save people from themselves, and they are a
great feature offered by relational databases. In exchange for a bit
of work up front, and for some small performance penalties during
runtime, you can ensure that your data remains intact. I would argue
that doing this sort of validation is important at both the database
and the application levels. A number of Ruby gems, as I explained here, make it
possible to do this sort of integration within Ruby on Rails.
