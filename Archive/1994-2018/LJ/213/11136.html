For the minimalist programmer, there's vim. For everybody else,
there's SlickEdit.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x286a2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I fell in love with SlickEdit a few years ago when I noticed its
ads on our Web site. Although most companies use the sort of Web ads you'd
expect in the tech industry, I took a second look when LOLCat images
appeared in the place of our regular ads. Admittedly, for a moment I thought
perhaps we'd been hacked, but when I realized I was looking at a
clever marketing campaign, I decided the folks at SlickEdit were okay in
my book. I recently had the chance to review SlickEdit, and although
my programming skills are fairly novice, SlickEdit made me feel right
at home.
</p><p>
SlickEdit is a text editor designed for programmers. Calling SlickEdit
a text editor, however, is much like calling the DeLorean from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Back
to the Future</em></span> a daily driver. SlickEdit makes the line between text
editing and full-blown IDE pretty fuzzy. It is available for nine platforms,
and, thankfully, Linux is one of them. In this review, I take a look at its features,
and you can decide whether it's a text editor, IDE or something
in between.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x286a568"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installation is fairly straightforward if you've ever installed a
closed-source application in Linux. Both 32- and 64-bit versions are
available, and on the handful of systems on which I installed it, I didn't run
into any problems with dependencies. The installation must be performed
on the command line, as there is interaction during the install (Figure 1). By default, the program is installed into the /opt/slickedit
directory. (Thanks to the SlickEdit folks for not using weird
capitalization in the installation directory; that is so frustrating.)
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11136f1.large.jpg"><img src="11136f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Installation must be done on the command line; there is no GUI installer.
</p></div></div><p>
Starting SlickEdit the first time is a little cumbersome, because the
installer doesn't appear to make any icons in the system menu or on the
desktop. A desktop icon is created after the first launch of SlickEdit,
but you have to get past the catch 22 of needing to start the program
to create the program startup icon. The executable to start SlickEdit
by default is <tt  >/opt/slickedit/bin/vs</tt>, and typing that in a command
shell starts the program and its initial wizard right up.
</p><p>
During the Quick Start Wizard, you start to see some of SlickEdit's neat features.
Figure 2 shows the configuration screen for selecting keyboard
emulation. If you're used to a particular set of keybindings
(like vim in my case), SlickEdit can use those familiar keybindings by
default. You even can customize the emulation if your needs don't line
up with the dozen-plus emulation options offered.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11136f2.large.jpg"><img src="11136f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The keystroke emulation makes SlickEdit behave like your favorite editor.
</p></div></div><p>
One of the other neat features configured during the initial wizard
phase is the customization of how you prefer your code to look. Figure
3 shows indentation and brace-style configurations that can be set for
all languages. The indentation and methods for displaying braces and
parentheses certainly don't change the compiled product, but they
make code look however you prefer. And, a happy coder is an efficient
coder, right?
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11136f3.large.jpg"><img src="11136f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. If SlickEdit is going to save time, it needs to know how you prefer to format
your code.
</p></div></div><p>
You can change many other initial settings, such as 
color themes,
font size and choice and so on. Once configured,
you even have the option to
export your settings so they can be imported on another machine. It's
a great feature if you use SlickEdit at home and at work, in order to
ensure your developing environments match.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x286ad50"></a>
Initial Impression</h2></div></div><p>
Once the initial quickstart is complete, it's easy to be overwhelmed
by the feature set. Thankfully, although SlickEdit boasts an incredible
number of features, understanding them all isn't a prerequisite for
coding. As shown in Figure 4, I jumped right in with a simple Bash script
to see how well it handles code formatting. As expected, it looks and
behaves quite nicely.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11136f4.large.jpg"><img src="11136f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. My messy Bash script was recognized without any problems.
</p></div></div><p>
Next, I tried to work with one of SlickEdit's new features, namely Git
repository interaction. Here, I was met with some frustration. Although I could
get SlickEdit to recognize my local cloned Git repository, using the GUI
tools to interact with a remote GitHub repo consistently locked up the
interface, requiring me to kill the process and start over. Admittedly,
I'm a novice programmer, but my na&iuml;vet&eacute; shouldn't lock up the
program. Git support is new, however, so it is possible a few bugs need
to be shaken out.
</p><p>
Although Git support is new, SlickEdit still has FTP built in to access
remote repositories. I really like the flexibility to use either the
built-in file management or to manipulate my files separately and
simply browse the local file structure with SlickEdit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x286b0c0"></a>
Features and Features and Features</h2></div></div><p>
SlickEdit is a code editor, and credit where credit is due, it really
excels in this area. Some features like code highlighting are expected,
but some others stand out from the crowd. I'm listing a few of my favorites 
below.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x286b1c8"></a>
Keyboard Emulation</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned earlier, this is an advantage for coders coming from other
programs. The ability to customize individual keystrokes is nice, but
it's the built-in support for other familiar program keybindings that
makes this feature so great. Emacs fan? You don't need to learn new
keystrokes to edit your code. Vim master? Same deal&mdash;you can save and
close a file like God intended by pressing &lt;ESC&gt;<tt  >:wq</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x286b380"></a>
Language Support</h2></div></div><p>
As a programmer, I'm personally limited to a handful of languages. In
fact, when it comes to Java, I can't even say hello to the
world. SlickEdit takes me to task in this department, supporting more than
40 languages. To be fair, some of those languages are specific to their
platform (that is, Microsoft), but I couldn't think of a single language
it doesn't support.
</p><p>
One of the advantages of using a tool like SlickEdit is that because it
knows languages you might not be intimately familiar with, it's
a great tool for jumping right in to unfamiliar code with unfamiliar
syntax (which leads to my next favorite feature).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x286b4e0"></a>
Autocompletion</h2></div></div><p>
Although not exactly SkyNet-type artificial intelligence, SlickEdit does
save time by automatically completing your commands&mdash;and with the
proper language-specific syntax. For example, if you type <tt  >for</tt> and
press the spacebar inside a C++ document, SlickEdit automatically creates
the parentheses and curly braces needed to complete the conditional
loop. I find this incredibly helpful when switching between languages,
because compilers aren't as forgiving with incorrect syntax as the
human brain might be.
</p><p>
Autocompletion doesn't stop with code syntax, however; SlickEdit also
autocompletes any symbols or words while you type. This is great for long
symbols or variable names. SlickEdit searches your open document in real
time for matches and pops up a box with the matches it finds. If you
don't want to use autocomplete, simply ignore the pop-up box and keep
typing. Focus isn't taken away from what you're typing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x286b698"></a>
Backup</h2></div></div><p>
As I've mentioned, SlickEdit supports revision control systems
like Git, but it also keeps a history of changes every time a file is
saved. Even if you haven't committed your changes, you still can see
the history of changes made to your files. Access to the save history
really can save your bacon if you accidentally save an error by
mistake.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x286b7f8"></a>
DIFFzilla</h2></div></div><p>
SlickEdit uses a tool called DIFFzilla to compare files. It's
also possible to compare folders full of files or active buffers in
the editor. What makes DIFFzilla great is that it does its best job to
reformat non-compilable differences (like whitespace or line breaks where
they don't matter) in order to display the code side by side. This may
seem like a minor feature, but it makes comparing files line by line
a breeze. In fact, you can edit the code directly from the DIFFzilla
window, and the updates are written back to the location where you opened the file.
Figure 5 shows DIFFzilla in action.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11136f5.large.jpg"><img src="11136f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. DIFFzilla adds things like the &ldquo;Imaginary Line Buffer&rdquo; in order
to line up code so it's easier to see.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x286bb10"></a>
Code Templates</h2></div></div><p>
For programmers who use chunks of code over and over (the foundation
of FOSS, no?), SlickEdit supports code templates. Basically, any
common coding elements can be saved as a template and used in a
project easily. Re-using code isn't revolutionary by any means, but
the templating system makes it easy to do. By using templates, there
is no longer a need to search/replace the files to make it match your
project. SlickEdit automatically changes the specified parts of the
template to match your needs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x286bc18"></a>
Regex Testing</h2></div></div><p>
Life without regex would be hard to sort through. Bad joke, I know, but
as powerful as regular expressions can be, they also can be mind-bending,
especially after a long day of coding. SlickEdit includes a &ldquo;Regex
Evaluator&rdquo;, which lets you test your regular expression in real time
against test data. It doesn't guarantee your regex will be perfect,
but the real-time testing can help eliminate silly mistakes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x2c63fc8"></a>
Macros</h2></div></div><p>
Programmers love to re-use code, but they also tend to repeat the same tasks
over and over as well. SlickEdit has a nifty macro-recording feature,
so that you can assign a keyboard shortcut to a process you need to do
often. It can be as simple as a key to add/remove a comment, or it can
be as complicated as rewriting sections of code.
</p><p>
If you have complex macros to create, SlickEdit includes its own
programming language specifically for macros. Slick-C has extremely
complex abilities that can interact with just about every facet of the
SlickEdit program. If you generally go through a long list of procedures
when you start a new project, SlickEdit can be programmed to do them
for you with a single keystroke. Information on the Slick-C language
is available on the SlickEdit Web site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x2c64128"></a>
Magic Paste</h2></div></div><p>
No, I'm not talking about that stuff you ate in kindergarten, but plain-old copy/paste. When
you paste a chunk of code from one place to another, SlickEdit will
match indentation and brace placement automatically. It's another
feature that doesn't affect the compiled code, but it makes the source
much easier to read and less embarrassing to share.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x2c64230"></a>
Built-in Command Line</h2></div></div><p>
A feature I bet Windows programmers appreciate even more than we do in
Linux is the built-in command-line interface. Once activated, the command
line offers a set of commands that can be accessed command-line-style. Its
similarity to the Linux command line might be a little confusing, because
although some of the output is similar (typing <tt  >ls</tt> for instance),
it's not truly a Linux shell. For quick mouse-free file interaction,
however, it is worth the effort to learn the commands available.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x2c64390"></a>
New Features</h2></div></div><p>
If you've been a SlickEdit user in the past, you'll likely find
SlickEdit 2011 (version 16) has a few really great enhancements.
Notably for Linux users are the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
64-bit version for those using 64-bit Linux.
</p></li><li><p>
Ruby debugging.
</p></li><li><p>
Git support.
</p></li><li><p>
Multithreading.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Although most of the new features are self-explanatory, the multithreading
is more than just minor code efficiency. In the past, when parsing
source code for tagging, SlickEdit would force the user to wait. Now,
a little box pops up telling you it's working in the background. For
large projects with lots of files, this seemingly insignificant feature
can save tons of time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2772580.0x2c64808"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
SlickEdit is an amazing tool. As a novice programmer, I barely scratched the
surface of its full abilities, but even so, I found it's extremely
useful. One of my favorite features is the keyboard emulation, which
makes the learning curve a little less steep. Although its features make it
ideal for a full-time, professional programmer, unfortunately, so does its
price. At $299 for a single user license, SlickEdit isn't for everyone,
but for programmers working in an environment where time is money,
its time-saving features alone will pay for itself in short order.
</p><p>
Apart from a few minor issues, like the lockups when trying to
configure Git, SlickEdit was very stable during my testing. The GUI
itself seems to use a proprietary toolkit, or one I'm not familiar
with. The menus behave strangely from time to time, and they refuse to close
occasionally, requiring me to click off the main window to get it to
behave properly. It's possible that is just some strange conflict with
my Xubuntu desktop, and it isn't a showstopper by any means.
</p><p>
If you want to try SlickEdit, there is a free 15-day trial,
which includes help from the SlickEdit support team. If you're an Eclipse
user, there is the SlickEdit core editor as a plugin for Eclipse. Both
options are available from SlickEdit's Web site: <a href="http://www.slickedit.com" target="_self">www.slickedit.com</a>.
