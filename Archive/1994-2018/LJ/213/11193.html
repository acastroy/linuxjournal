<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #213, January 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>kernel.org</b></span> break-in continues to inconvenience developers,
although the various pieces do seem to be getting picked up. A lot of
git repositories are returning to kernel.org as their maintainers
submit credentials into the new <span   class="bold"><b>GPG</b></span> &ldquo;web of trust&rdquo; that is designed to
reassure the kernel.org administrators that git tree maintainers are
who they say they are. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> also
has endorsed the web of
trust by asking people sending him pull requests to make sure their
repositories are hosted on kernel.org, so he can trust their identity.
Establishing a web of trust is not the easiest thing to manage. A lot
of key-signing events have been announced all over the world, but some
people don't live close to any of those events and may have a hard
time getting their keys signed, without which they won't be allowed to
maintain git repositories on kernel.org.
</p><p>
Another difficulty is that people within the web of trust might have a
security breach on their personal systems, which could result in their
private GPG keys being compromised. <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> recently posted
tips on how to avoid that at <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/9/30/425" target="_self">https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/9/30/425</a>.
Greg admonished, &ldquo;it is imperative that nobody falls victim to the
belief that it cannot happen to them.&rdquo;
</p><p>
An important thing to remember about all of these security measures is
that they don't impact regular contributors who want to submit patches
to the kernel. You can all still send your patches to the mailing list
with no problem. The web of trust is intended only for people
maintaining git repositories on kernel.org, because those people will
have to be trusted by the kernel.org administrators not to taint
those repositories.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>VirtualBox</b></span> came under some heavy criticism
recently. <span   class="bold"><b>Dave Jones</b></span>
remarked that a lot of kernel bug reports were due to VirtualBox
corrupting memory and having weird crashes. He posted a patch to taint
any kernel that had VirtualBox loaded, so that any automated
bug-collecting tools could choose to ignore bug reports coming in from
those systems.
</p><p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman approved of Dave's patch, and the conversation
proceeded to the point where people were suggesting that all
out-of-tree patches should be tainted in a similar way.
Eventually <span   class="bold"><b>Frank Mehnert</b></span>, the VirtualBox maintainer, responded to the
complaints against VirtualBox. He said, &ldquo;We always have had good relations
to the Open Source community, so feel free to point me to an archive where
all these kernel panic reports arrive that you've got. We fixed some
bugs in our kernel modules in the past, and it is even possible that
some of the current bug reports are from older versions of VirtualBox
that might have been fixed in the meantime.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Neil Brown</b></span> submitted a <span   class="bold"><b>suspend d&aelig;mon</b></span>, intended to provide a basic
set of interfaces for user programs to control how and when the system
can suspend. If a program should not be interrupted, it can use the
d&aelig;mon to prevent the system from suspending at that time. Likewise,
if a program wants to suspend the system, it can tell the d&aelig;mon to
suspend the system as soon as no other program is blocking suspension.
A lot of technical details came under discussion, in particular the
selection of interface (ioctl, sysfs, system calls and so on), but overall,
Neil's basic idea seems to have some support from a lot of developers.

Creating a live Linux USB stick isn't anything new. And, in fact, the
ability to have persistence with a live CD/USB stick isn't terribly
new. What many people might not be aware of, however, is just how easy
it is to make a bootable USB stick that you can use like a regular
Linux install. Using the &ldquo;Startup Disk Creator&rdquo; in any of the Ubuntu
derivatives, creating a bootable USB drive with persistence is as
simple as dragging a slider to determine how much space to reserve
for persistence!
</p><p>
The concept of persistence has come a long way too. The casper filesystem
basically overlays the live USB session, so you actually can install
programs in your live session and have those programs remain installed
the next time you boot. The same is true with files you might create and
store in your home directory as well. If you've ever liked the concept
of a live USB, but felt limited by the default set of applications,
persistence is for you. In fact, with a sizable USB stick and a little
more work, you can make a multiboot USB stick with persistence as well.

<h2 class="title">Fade In Pro</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Charles Olsen</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #213, January 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When I switched from Windows to Linux, I found software to replace
almost everything I had been doing in Windows. Most of the software I
needed was in the repos, although I did pay for a couple commercial
programs.
</p><p>
The most difficult program to replace was Final Draft, a commercial
program for writing screenplays. Final Draft is available for Windows
and Macs, but not for Linux. It also does not run in Wine or CrossOver
Office.
</p><p>
I understand that software for writing screenplays is a small niche,
but it's not limited only to writers in Hollywood. Any company that
prepares videos for training or other purposes would benefit from a
program that helps write scripts.
</p><p>
You can write scripts with a word processor, of course. But, the
formatting is tricky and goes beyond what you can accomplish just by
using styles. A dedicated script-writing tool ensures that all your
formatting is correct, and it also can help in other ways.
</p><p>
At first, I was able to get by with Celtx, a free screenplay program
that is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. But a nasty bug crept
into the Linux version, making it painful to enter character names for
dialogue. Although the developer acknowledged the issue two years ago,
and several new versions have been released since then, the bug is
still there.
</p><p>
A new solution now is available. Fade In Professional Screenwriting
Software is a powerful application for writing screenplays, and
it includes tools for organizing and navigating the script, as well as
tools for managing revisions and rewrites.
</p><p>
Fade In intelligently handles the various formatting elements of a
screenplay. You can format the elements manually using key
combinations or menus, or you can format everything just by using the
Enter and Tab keys. Type a Scene Heading and press Enter, and the next
element automatically is formatted as Action. Press Tab to change the
formatting to Character, which automatically is followed by
Dialogue. Press Tab to change from Dialogue to Parenthetical, which formats
properly and inserts the parentheses. 
</p><p>
Fade In builds autocomplete lists of your characters and
locations. Once you've written a character or location, you can
re-enter it with a couple keystrokes. 
</p><p>
When it's time to produce a screenplay, Fade In can help by generating
standard production reports including scenes, cast, locations and so on.
You then can print these reports or save them to HTML or CSV.
</p><p>
Fade In can import and export files in these formats: Final Draft,
Formatted Text, Screenplay Markdown, Unformatted Text and XML. It 
also can import files in Celtx or Rich Text Format and export to PDF and 
HTML. The Final Draft format is particularly important if you want to
sell your script or submit it to certain screenplay-writing contests. 
</p><p>
Fade In is not free. According to the Web site, the regular price is
$99.95, although at the time of this writing, you can get it for $49.95. Either way,
it's much cheaper than $249 for Final Draft. You can download the demo
and try it first, then buy it if the software works for you.
</p><p>
There also are versions of Fade In for mobile devices: Android, iPhone
and iPad.
</p><p>
You can download the Linux version as a DEB, RPM or tar.gz file in
either 32-bit or 64-bit versions.

We talk about Dropbox a lot here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>&mdash;from tips and tricks,
to free Web site hosting, to cloud backups. The good news for those
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> readers stuck using alternative operating systems is that Dropbox
doesn't pick favorites. (Even if we do.)
</p><p>
Even though Linux supports a wide variety of network protocols, getting
computers networked together often can be a nightmare. For quick-and-efficient transfer of files, it's hard to beat Dropbox's seamless
syncing. With the free 2GB of storage, even fairly large files are easy
to transfer.

What may sound like a perverse concept is actually one of the many ways
smartphones can change your life. If you play a musical instrument
but don't happen to have perfect pitch (most of us, sadly), you can buy
a tuner, pitch pipe, tuning fork or any number of other aids to
keep yourself in tune. If you have a smartphone in your pocket, however,
you also can simply download gStrings. Available in the Android Marketplace
in either a free ad-supported version or an inexpensive ad-free version,
gStrings will help you tune any number of instruments accurately.
</p><p>
Although it's certainly no replacement for perfect pitch, having
a tuner in your pocket is very convenient if you're a
musician. Quite a few tuning apps are available for
Android, but I've used gStrings personally, and it works
great: <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=org.cohortor.gstrings" target="_self">https://market.android.com/details?id=org.cohortor.gstrings</a>.

<h2 class="title">Astronomy on the Desktop</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">

Many people's initial exposure to science is through astronomy, and they are inspired by that first look through a
telescope or their first glimpse of a Hubble image. Several
software packages are available for the Linux desktop that allow users to
enjoy their love of the stars. I look at several packages in this
article that
should be available for most distributions.
</p><p>
The first is Stellarium, 
my personal favorite for day-to-day stargazing. When you install it,
you get a thorough star catalog. By default, Stellarium
starts up in full-screen mode. The layout makes for a
very attractive display of the sky above you, and almost all the details
of the display are customizable. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11193stellarf1.large.jpg"><img src="11193stellarf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Opening Stellarium gives you a look at the local sky.
</p></div></div><p>
If you hover your mouse pointer over
either the bottom-left border or the lower-left-side border, one of
two configuration panels appears. From here,
you can set visual items, such as constellation outlines, constellation
names, whether galaxies and nebulae are visible, as well as 
a coordinate grid. You also can set location and time values. This means
you not only can see what the sky looked like in the past or what it
will look like in the future, but you also can see what it looks like on
the other side of the planet. Additionally, you can add even more stars to the catalog
that Stellarium uses. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11193stellarf2.large.jpg"><img src="11193stellarf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You can set the time so it's later, letting you check out what you might want to
look for that evening.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11193stellarf3.large.jpg"><img src="11193stellarf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The configuration window lets you download even more star catalogs.
</p></div></div><p>
Stellarium includes a script capability. With it, you can script views of
starfields and share them with others. When you install Stellarium, you get
several demo scripts to use as examples. As of version 0.10.1,
there is a new scripting engine based on the Qt scripting engine. 
A full API is available, allowing you to interact with all of the
functions that Stellarium provides. It is a full scripting language
called ECMAscript. You may know it better as JavaScript. You can define
your own functions, encapsulating larger chunks of work. There is a
for statement, providing a loop structure that will look familiar to C and
Java programmers. 
</p><p>
To access and run scripts in Stellarium, you need to
open the configuration window and click on the scripts tab. Once you've
written your own scripts and want to run them, you can place them in
the scripts subdirectory of the user data directory. On Linux machines,
the user data directory is $HOME/.stellarium. Once you put your script
files there, along with any textures they may require, they will show up
within the list of scripts in the configuration window. 
A plugin architecture also is available, but it is much harder to use, and the
API varies from version to version.
</p><p>
The nice thing about Stellarium is that it isn't limited to your
computer. It can interact with the real world in a couple 
ways. The first is through telescope control. Stellarium provides two
different mechanisms for controlling your telescope. The older mechanism
is a client-server model. The server runs as a standalone application
that connects to and controls one telescope. It then can listen to one
or more clients, which can include Stellarium. Several options
are available for the server portion, and they provide control for many
telescopes from Meade, Celestron and others. The second mechanism is a
plugin for Stellarium, which first was available in version 0.10.3. This
mechanism can send only slew instructions to the telescope, which 
essentially are &ldquo;go to&rdquo; instructions. 
</p><p>
One major warning is that Stellarium
will not stop you from slewing to the sun. This could damage both eyes
and equipment if you don't have proper filters on your telescope,
so always be careful if you are working during the day. 
</p><p>
The plugin
can interact with pretty much any telescope that understands either
the Meade LX200 interface or the Celestron NexStar interface. 
</p><p>
The
other way Stellarium can interact with the real world is as a
planetarium. Stellarium can handle the calculations involved in projecting
over a sphere. This way, you can make a DIY planetarium. You need
a dome onto which you can project your display across the inside. You
also need a video projector and a spherical security mirror. 
Use the spherical distortion feature in Stellarium and then project
the results through the video projector and onto the mirror. Then, you
can lie back under the dome and see the sky above you. The Stellarium Web
site (<a href="http://www.stellarium.org" target="_self">www.stellarium.org</a>) has links to groups
on the Internet where you can find help and hints when building your
own planetarium.
</p><p>
The other popular astronomy program is Celestia. Celestia is a three-dimensional simulation of the universe. Where most astronomy software
shows you what the sky looks like from the surface of the Earth,
Celestia can show you what the sky looks like from anywhere in the
solar system. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11193stellarf4.large.jpg"><img src="11193stellarf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. When you first open Celestia, you get a satellite-eye view of the Earth.
</p></div></div><p>
Celestia has a powerful scripting engine that allows you to produce tours
of the universe.
When you install
Celestia, you get a script called demo.cel that gives you an idea of
its capabilities. The add-on section of the Celestia Web site (<a href="http://www.shatters.net/celestia" target="_self">www.shatters.net/celestia</a>) includes
a full repository of available scripts. 
</p><p>
Because so much work has
been done to make it as scientifically accurate as possible, it also
is being used in educational environments. Currently, 12 journeys
are available that provide information for students and the general public
on the wonders of the universe. As opposed to scripts, journeys give you
more control over your speed and pace, allowing you to take more time at
the areas that are of most interest to you. 
</p><p>
When you install Celestia,
you get the core part of the program and a few extra add-ons. Currently,
more than 500 add-ons are available, and if you install them all,
you will need more than 18GB of drive space. The main repository you should
check out first is located at <a href="http://www.celestiamotherlode.net" target="_self">www.celestiamotherlode.net</a>.
</p><p>
If you want to travel to another planet in the solar system, you can click
on Navigation&rarr;Go to Object. Here you can enter the
name of the object and how far away you want to be. Then, click on
Go To, and you'll be taken there directly. Once you're there, you can rotate
your camera view with the arrow keys. In this way, you can go to Mars and
turn around and see what the sky looks like from there. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11193stellarf5.large.jpg"><img src="11193stellarf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. When you want to go to an object, you can set what object you want go to and how
far away you are.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11193stellarf6.large.jpg"><img src="11193stellarf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You can zoom in to see the Great Red Spot on Jupiter.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11193stellarf6.large.jpg"><img src="11193stellarf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. You can look out and see the night sky on Mars.
</p></div></div><p>
If you want to move around the orbit of the body you're currently
at, you can use the Shift and arrow keys to slide around and see the
whole surface. What you see when you are in
orbit around another planet is a texture mapped onto the body.
</p><p>
Celestia's core installation includes a minimal set of textures that strive
to be as accurate as possible. You can change the textures being used
by including add-ons from the repository. Some of these include textures
that allow you to see what the Earth may have looked like during the last
Ice Age or even four billion years ago.
</p><p>
In 2007, Vincent Giangiulio created an add-on called Lua Edu Tools. This
add-on provides all kinds of extra functionality to Celestia. A
toolkit is displayed on the right side of the screen that provides
sliders for controlling many of Celestia's parameters. It also provides a
&ldquo;cockpit&rdquo; overlay, making it feel even more like you're flying through
space. The default texture is the space shuttle, but you can use other
ones too. Celestia also lets you use a joystick to control movement,
so you can immerse yourself completely into your dream of flying through
space.
</p><p>
You can share your experiences with others by saving still images
or movies. If you click on File&rarr;Capture Image, Celestia lets
you save a PNG or JPEG image file. Clicking on File&rarr;Capture
Movie lets you save a movie of your travels. You can set the
aspect ratio, the frame rate and the video quality. Once you click
Save, Celestia will be ready to start recording. When you are ready,
click the F11 key to start recording. When you're done, you can
stop recording by clicking F12.
</p><p>
This article is only an introduction to what you can
do. Hopefully, it inspires you to go explore the universe on your
desktop. From there, bundle up and go spend the night out under the
skies. You won't regret it.

This time of year is often rough on finances, and although there are many
money-management tools available for Linux, none are quite like You
Need A Budget, or YNAB for short. Unlike traditional budgeting programs,
YNAB focuses on a few simple rules to help you get out of debt and, more
important, to see where your money is going. If you've ever struggled
with sticking to a budget (I certainly have), give YNAB a try. I'm not a
&ldquo;numbers person&rdquo;, yet YNAB seems to make sense.

YNAB is an Adobe Air-based application, so it runs on Windows, Macintosh
and Linux. It's not free, but there's a seven-day trial and a 30-day money-back guarantee. There's even an app in the Android Marketplace that will
sync with your desktop application for entering purchases on the go. YNAB
isn't for everyone, but if you've ever struggled with budgeting and
been frustrated that most finance applications are Windows-only,
give YNAB a try: <a href="http://www.youneedabudget.com" target="_self">www.youneedabudget.com</a>.
