Dustin Boswell and Trever Foucher's <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Readable
Code</em></span> (O'Reilly Media)</h2></div></div><p>
All the geeks among us who inhabit the programming subculture must admit to
writing code that they'd be ashamed to show to Mom. In order to stay on
Mom's (and your boss') good side, as well as add elegance to your
work, pick up Dustin Boswell and Trever Foucher's essential new
programming book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Readable Code</em></span>. The book, says publisher
O'Reilly Media, &ldquo;focuses on the nuts and bolts of programming, with
simple and practical techniques you can use every time you sit down to write
code.&rdquo; Included are numerous practical tips, easy-to-digest code
examples, helpful illustrations and cartoons to keep things entertaining.
Other topics including picking variable names that are dense with
information, organizing easy-to-understand loops and conditionals, creating
effective comments, writing concise but thorough tests and mastering the art
of breaking hard problems into smaller ones.

Radical Breeze's Illumination Software Creator</h2></div></div><p>
The hot selling point for Radical Breeze's Illumination Software Creator,
which was recently upgraded to version 4.1, is creating software without
writing a single line of code. Illumination converts visual concepts into
source code for the user; no virtual machine is involved. The developed
applications run natively on desktops, iPhones, iPads, Android devices,
Nokia (Maemo) Internet Tablets and HTML5 and Flash Web. And, now with v4.1
for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows, you can do that in a more expansive and
bug-free manner. Although the recent version 4.0 added ability to create HTML5
Web applications along with an easier method of adding graphics to apps, the
newer v4.1 now adds a &ldquo;boat-load&rdquo; of bug fixes, implements and other
user-requested changes. Radical Breeze calls Illumination Software 4.1
&ldquo;the most solid, bug-free release we have ever had. It is absolutely
glorious&rdquo;. Who knew that programming could be so
fun?

Tobias Klein's <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Bug Hunter's Diary</em></span> (No Starch)</h2></div></div><p>
Seemingly simple bugs, says author Tobias Klein, can have drastic
consequences, allowing attackers to compromise systems, escalate local
privileges and otherwise wreak havoc on a system. In Klein's new book,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A Bug Hunter's Diary: A Guided Tour Through the Wilds of Software
Security</em></span>,
readers will learn how to weed out bugs by following the tracks of a
renowned security expert as he exploits bugs in some of the world's most
popular software, like Apple's iOS, the VLC media player, Web browsers and
even the Mac OS X (ahem, non-Linux) kernel. In this &ldquo;one-of-a-kind
account&rdquo;, readers see how the developers responsible for these flaws
patched the bugs&mdash;or failed to respond at all&mdash;gaining deep technical
knowledge and insight into how hackers approach difficult problems and
experience the true joys (and frustrations) of bug hunting. Readers will
learn techniques on finding bugs, exploiting vulnerabilities like NULL
pointer dereferences, buffer overflows and type conversion flaws, and developing proof-of-concept code that verifies the security flaw and
reports bugs to vendors.

Digium and Open Source Community's Asterisk</h2></div></div><p>
We're always thrilled to announce major upgrades from the pantheon of killer
Linux apps, and this month's star is the recently announced Asterisk 10.
Asterisk is the most popular open-source platform to allow developers to
create powerful business phone systems and unified communications solutions.
Digium reports more than two million downloads in 2011 alone. In v10, Caretaker
Digium and the dedicated crew of contributors have put forth a significant
release whose most important new feature is its advanced, wide-band media
engine, which supports studio-quality audio and a nearly unlimited number of
codecs. By supporting high- and ultra-high-definition voice, says Digium,
Asterisk now can be used to power communications applications that otherwise would
have required specialized or expensive equipment and service in
order to convey nuances in speech or emotion. New codec support is included
for Digium Skype's SILK codec and 32kHz Speex, as well as passthrough
support for CELT. Other features include additional sampling rates, a new
conferencing app, support for videoconferencing, new fax capabilities and
text-message routing.
