programming life a little easier. This tool suite includes four
related tools: debugger, checker, wrapper and compiler. Some tools
are graphical, and others are command line. Two TclPro-specific
interpreters, <span   class="bold"><b>prowish</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>protclsh</b></span>, are also included. These
four tools provide several valuable services.
</p><p>The first tool is a Tcl compiler. The current release of Tcl
compiles source code before execution. With TclPro, one can compile
source code independent of execution. This gives you the ability to
distribute your programs in a compiled format. Not all of the Tcl
source can be compiled with TclPro v1.1; items which cannot be
compiled independent of execution will be compiled when executed. A
procedure that takes a script as an argument is an example of
something that cannot be compiled before execution.</p><p>Distributing a Tcl/Tk program to non-Tcl platforms requires
the distribution of several Tcl/Tk files and libraries besides the
application's Tcl script. With the TclPro Wrapper, you can bundle
all of the various files into one statically or dynamically wrapped
file. Wrapping a Tcl application statically creates a stand-alone
bundle of <span   class="bold"><b>tclsh</b></span> and all related
Tcl libraries and application files. I wrapped a simple 1820-byte
file and in return received a file almost 1.67MB in size. Programs
prepared in this manner can be loaded and run on platforms without
regard to the installed Tcl version.</p><p>Wrapping an application dynamically will reduce the
application's size. The same dynamically wrapped 1820-byte file
produced an output file of about 107.5KB. There is a cost for this
smaller footprint. Dynamically wrapped applications require the
target platform's Tcl installation to be compatible with the Tcl
release of your application. Both non-compiled and compiled Tcl
files may be fed to the TclPro Wrapper.</p><p>Each new version of software presents some new functions or
features. Sometimes a little backward compatibility is lost among
those new features and functions. I am notorious for dropping a
semicolon or curly brace in my code. TclPro Checker addresses these
and several other programming issues. It can detect parsing and
syntax errors. Four types of warnings are provided by TclPro
Checker. There are warnings about platform portability of the code,
performance-optimization opportunities for code segments,
potentially incorrect command usage, and warnings about changes in
syntax conventions between older and newer Tcl versions. The output
of TclPro Checker streams across the screen. You may want to page
the output or redirect it to a file.</p><p><a href="3304f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1.</a> TclPro Debugger Screen</p><p>The fourth tool is a graphical debugger with a trick up its
sleeve. Figure 1 shows how information is presented in the three
panels. The upper-left panel presents the stack. Variables and
their values are presented in the upper-right panel. Code being
debugged is displayed in the lower panel. A toolbar provides the
means of stepping in, through, around and over procedures and
related code.</p><p>TclPro Debugger's other useful feature is remote debugging.
With this tool, you can actually debug a Tcl/Tk program residing on
another platform. Don't get too excited just yet. You cannot
randomly select any remote file to debug. Some prep work is
required before files can be debugged remotely. Three commands with
arguments must be entered into the remote file. Only after doing
this can you debug them remotely.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c69580.0x1d61c38"></a>Install Experience</h2></div></div><p>The message here is not that I had an installation problem.
It is about the timeliness and accuracy of Scriptics e-mail support
staff. They knew me only as another person who was having a problem
installing their fully-functioning download product for evaluation
on a Caldera OpenLinux (COL) v1.3 Linux platform.</p><p>Installation materials and the Scriptics web site said TclPro
was known to install and function properly on Solaris, HP and Irix
UNIX flavors. SuSE 5.3+ and Red Hat 5.0+ were the only two Intel
Linux distributions listed as known to support TclPro. The
instructions said TclPro should work on other Linux distributions,
providing they used glibc2. Having just upgraded my platform to COL
v1.3 with glibc, I could not see any reason why TclPro should not
run on my platform.</p><p>After verifying libc's installation and reading all of the
available README and INSTALL.TXT files, I tried my first TclPro
install. It failed. I repeated the install and verified my steps
and the displayed error messages. I contacted Scriptics Support
with the symptoms and error messages. The next business day, I
received a response requesting some additional information, a basic
explanation of the install process and a couple of things to try.
Later in the day, I sent Scriptics Support the requested
information. I received a response the next business day. The folks
at Scriptics quickly spotted that COL v1.3 appended a dot (.) to
the end of TclPro's CD-ROM file names. This dot was appended only
to file names that did not already contain an extension. I did not
have a solution, yet I knew what the problem was and knew an answer
was being sought. Another business day passed and I received a
workaround for my COL v1.3 installation. Using the workaround, the
TclPro1.1 installation went flawlessly.</p><p>I was set up to use KDE. My screen resolution is such that
the entire install dialog boxes did not appear on the screen.
Resizing the dialog boxes under KDE prevented access to the dialog
box buttons. I suggest using the X Window System for product
installation. With X Windows, you can move portions of the dialog
box off the screen to see the various buttons.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c69580.0x1d61e48"></a>Documentation and Other Resources</h2></div></div><p>TclPro1.1 comes with a 107-page User's Guide in both hard-
and soft-copy formats. The soft copy is in PDF format and requires
the Acrobat 3.0+ viewer. Local on-line documentation also includes
browser-based help and man pages. Additional information, resources
and links are available at
http://www.scriptics.com/resources/.</p><p>I compared a couple of the User's Guide chapters with the
browser's help content. The User's Guide and the local
browser-based help content are similar in some respects and also
contain some differences. One primary difference is the
availability of message IDs within the on-line help.</p><p>I did notice a couple of minor things about the browser-based
on-line help. The on-line &ldquo;Using TclPro Checker&rdquo; topic referred
to a nonexistent example. I did find the same topic and example in
the User's Guide. On the other hand, I attempted to use an example
command from the book and it failed. The command usage error
messages and the on-line help quickly pointed out the book's
error.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c69580.0x1d62000"></a>Licensing</h2></div></div><p>At the time of this writing, Scriptics' web site and other
literature indicated TclPro is licensed to a named individual and
not the platform. No clear indication was given as to how licenses
could be reallocated within an organization if a personnel turnover
were to occur. Licensing relief may be on the horizon. The next
release of TclPro will offer a UNIX-based network license package.
A five-user license will be the smallest available network
license.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c69580.0x1d62108"></a>Support</h2></div></div><p>A 30-day e-mail installation and evaluation support service
is included. As mentioned above, my experience with this support
was quite positive. Scriptics also offers three levels of fee-based
support. The lowest level is an annual product update service. This
level of support provides only product updates. The two other
levels of support, Gold and Platinum, go beyond product updates and
are sold on a per-user basis. At the time of this review, the
product update service is a prerequisite for either the Gold or
Platinum support levels&mdash;not an unreasonable condition. I feel some
of the other conditions on support need to be rethought. For
example, the Gold-level support required purchasing support for a
minimum of five users. This is rather expensive if you own only one
or two licenses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c69580.0x1d62210"></a>Minimum Platform</h2></div></div><p>I was unable to find recommended minimum system requirements
in the documentation or on the web site. This product's
command-line tools run on a 486/66 platform with 24MB of RAM. I do
not recommend running the debugger on this class machine unless you
do not mind waiting several minutes. TclPro1.1 runs quite nicely on
a 300MHz Pentium II with 64MB of RAM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c69580.0x1d62318"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I found TclPro Version 1.1 easy to learn and found value in
each of the four TclPro tools. I feel the product is definitely
worth the download and evaluation. The User's Guide very adeptly
describes TclPro: &ldquo;TclPro is an evolving piece of software. We
will continually improve TclPro according to the user feedback and
the needs of the Tcl community.&rdquo; Let Scriptics know if it does not
meet your needs.</p><p>Note that a beta release of TclPro Version 1.2 was made
available shortly before this article was submitted for
publication.</p></div></div>
