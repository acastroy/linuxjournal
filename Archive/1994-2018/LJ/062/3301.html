    If you need a catalog system for your web page, this product
    may be just what you are looking for.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d09580.0x1e013a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>When managing an ISP, you will eventually
need a solution for electronic commerce. Many possible solutions
are available, but the problem is that they are either big and
expensive or small freeware that does not include all the necessary
options. I heard about a system called MiniVend, released under the
GNU General Public, and decided to try it out.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d09580.0x1e014a8"></a>Features</h2></div></div><p>MiniVend is a full-featured electronic catalog system
(commonly known as a shopping cart) with on-line ordering
capability. It is designed to provide an interface complete with
SSL security and full database support.</p><p>Some of the main features of MiniVend 3.0 are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Multiple catalogs allow one server to run many
shops, so it is ideal for an ISP.</p></li><li><p>Security is provided through SSL for credit card
ordering and PGP for mailing of orders.</p></li><li><p>It has a well-developed database integration with
SQL support, including ODBC.</p></li><li><p>A very powerful search capability is provided with
fast binary search, range searching, numeric and alphanumeric
search sorting with reverse, numeric and case-insensitive options,
etc.</p></li><li><p>All aspects of the appearance can be controlled.
MiniVend supports frames, and the pages can be built on the fly or
pre-built for heavily used items.</p></li><li><p>It is very flexible, with sales tax, discount and
freight calculation, easy price adjustments and much more.</p></li><li><p>Cookie support allows users to leave the shop and
come back without losing session state. It works well with all
browsers and includes CyberCash support.</p></li><li><p>Easy administration is possible with automated
installation and configuration, and off-line and on-line database
builds.</p></li></ul></div><p>MiniVend is a client/server system. The browser talks with a
small application that in turn talks with the MiniVend server
through a socket. For this reason, you don't have to load the
MiniVend server for each user session, which might overload the
system.

Figure 1. The MiniVend System
</p></div></div>

</p><p>I don't know how the name came to be&mdash;there is nothing
&ldquo;mini&rdquo; about it. It is a full-featured electronic commerce system
that can meet the needs most people have for such a system.
MiniVend is powerful and correspondingly complex. It can easily
scale from a few items per catalog to a million items or more, with
excellent performance. If you have only a few items and don't
intend to grow, MiniVend is probably overkill.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d09580.0x1e01e48"></a>Requirements for Electronic Commerce</h2></div></div><p>The key issues are ease of use and flexibility. The system
should do what is needed without too much administrative work and
also include all your desired features in an easy-to-use
manner.</p><p>Options that are a must include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The ability to exchange data between internal and
external databases. The product information will normally be kept
in a company database of some kind, and entering data by hand would
be cumbersome, to say the least.</p></li><li><p>Automate the order process as much as possible. The
ideal situation will be one where you only have to feed the order
into your system, with all taxes, freight costs, etc. handled by
the software.</p></li><li><p>A method of handling discounts for selected
customers and for volume sales should be available.</p></li><li><p>Feedback should be sent to the customer by e-mail
when an order is made. This helps to catch any errors made by the
system or the customer.</p></li><li><p>Security for payments is also an issue. The system
needs to use SSL and perhaps another encryption protocol when it
sends data to and from the database.</p></li><li><p>Good documentation and support is needed. The
documentation should be so well-written that it can get you started
quickly (in a matter of hours); the support should get you past any
show stopper.</p></li></ul></div><p>We all have different needs, and each person will have a
preference as to what goes into a system for electronic commerce. I
like a system that does only what it is supposed to do: handle
product information, searching and ordering, while leaving domain
name registration and chat rooms to their own specialized tools.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d09580.0x1e02478"></a>Why I Chose MiniVend</h2></div></div><p>Whenever I have a choice between commercial and Open Source
products, I always try out the freeware first. Of course, there is
the issue of price, which in the case of Shopping Carts can be a
very big issue. Access to the source code will in most cases
guarantee that the system is more error-free, because users can
have a look at the code and suggest solutions to any existing
problem. After all, the users are the people who know where the
trouble is, and they are normally more motivated to find and
correct it.</p><p>However, it is not only a choice between commercial and Open
Source systems. Other Open Source products are available, but
MiniVend stands out in the features category. It is simply
incredible how much functionality is provided and how easy it is to
configure. All the configuration options I could think of and more
are included.</p><p>Also, MiniVend is easy to use with several merchants, and I
can use it with my Apache 1.3 with no problems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d09580.0x1e02630"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Installation couldn't be easier. Simply type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
su wwwrun
tar xvzf minivend-latest.tar.gz
</pre><p>in the directory where you want the installation directory to
be created. This command will unpack the latest version of
MiniVend. The version I downloaded was 3.11, which was released
only a week or so before I tried it. (See Resources.)
</p><p>The user wwwrun owns the web server's /DocumentRoot
directory. Any user with write access to both this and the /cgi-bin
directory can be used.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./configure
</pre><p>The installation process includes a long question-and-answer
session, but you can just press enter to answer most of the
questions; MiniVend comes with sensible default values. When the
installation of MiniVend is finished, you will get the opportunity
to install a catalog:
<pre     class="programlisting">
-&gt; /home/httpd/mvend
-&gt; Make the simple demo now? [yes]
</pre>


Select a short, mnemonic name for the catalog. This will be used to
set the defaults for naming the catalog, executable and directory,
so you will have to type in this name frequently. If you are doing
the demo for the first time, you might use &ldquo;simple&rdquo;:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Catalog name? simple
</pre>


The rest of the installation consists of some simple questions I
won't repeat here. The server name and /cgi-bin location should be
working before you try to install MiniVend.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3301f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Simple Demo
</p></div></div>

</p><p>When everything is installed and ready, you can start the
MiniVend server with this command (use the path to your
installation):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/home/httpd/mvend/bin/start
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d09580.0x1e02c08"></a>Installation Notes</h2></div></div><p>MiniVend is a big program, meaning it is very complex, and if
you encounter problems, support is not always available. A mailing
list is available, but none of my questions got answered during the
test period. That included questions about internationalization and
the installation problem I had on the one machine on which it was
needed.</p><p>On the other hand, I found the documentation to be very
extensive, though a bit hard to follow at times. The 600KB HTML
documentation (see Figure 3) is a definite plus.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3301f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. MiniVend HTML Documentation
</p></div></div><p>Be very careful with your choice of user for the MiniVend
server. This user must have write access to both the /DocumentRoot
and the /cgi-bin directory, as you will install a demo with both
HTML pages and CGI-scripts. But don't make the mistake of running
the MiniVend server and the web server as the same user --that is a
security risk to avoid. The best solution in a production system is
to create a new user to handle the MiniVend server.</p><p>It is the user's duty to ensure the security of sensitive
data. You can set up MiniVend to leave the data anywhere on the
server or send it by e-mail to the merchant, but you must consider
how to encrypt the data. MiniVend supports PGP encryption, so there
is a way to set up a secure data transfer.</p><p>During this short test period, I obviously didn't have time
to test for &ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo;, but everything seems to be designed
with ease of use in mind. The system tables, e.g., sales tax or
freight values, are easy to adjust, and you can update the database
off-line or on-line, as individual records or all in one
swoop.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d09580.0x1df98b8"></a>Configuration of Web Pages</h2></div></div><p>There's a host of options for configuring web pages. MiniVend
has a complete tag language with over 80 different functions. You
can embed code in the pages and use conditional statements like
<b  >[if ...] <i><tt>text</tt></i> [else]
else-<i><tt>text</tt></i> [/else][/if]</b>,
allowing for insertion of text or HTML code based on some computed
choice.</p><p>All MiniVend commands are embedded in the pages within square
brackets ([ ]). MiniVend preprocesses the pages before turning them
over to the web server, replacing the commands with the values they
represent. The most basic commands are the data tags that embed
information from the database in the web page, but there are also
commands for looping, inserting text from external files, inserting
total fields and a lot more.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3301f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Example of a Configured Page
</p></div></div><p>The example in Figure 4 was done with an external file
holding all the text of the page. I named a field &ldquo;webpage&rdquo; and
put it in the database, then inserted this in the template for the
product page:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[include pages/products/[item-field webpage]]
</pre><p>which means I want to include a file at this point in the web
page. The file should be found in the directory /pages/products/
and have the name that is taken from the web page field of that
product.
</p><p>As a developer, I was happy to learn you can even embed Perl
code into the pages. At the same time, I have to agree with the
documentation; it is a feature to be used rarely. Embedding Perl is
like using a chain saw: you can get the job done quickly, but if
used wrong, it can cost you an arm and a leg!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d09580.0x1df9e38"></a>Administration</h2></div></div><p>At the heart of MiniVend is the Products database. Normally,
it is just an ASCII file with fields separated by tabs. The field
names are given in the first row and MiniVend indexes the database
with GDBM (GNU Database Manager) automatically. You can even hook
up to a real SQL database through Perl's unique DBI interface, if
you already have one.</p><p>You can update the database on the command line with the
<span   class="bold"><b>offline</b></span> command, or if you just
want to change one record, you can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>update</b></span> command.</p><p>It is possible to import data from any source, provided the
data can be formatted with the fields separated by tabs. If you
want to adjust all the prices in the system, it is easy to do so
with the <span   class="bold"><b>commonadjust</b></span>
feature.</p><p>MiniVend records all sessions for future use. Obviously, some
session data will become obsolete after a while, so it is a good
idea to put an expire script in your crontab file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
44 4 * * * /home/httpd/mvend/bin/expireall -r
</pre><p>This will prevent your session databases from growing too
large.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d09580.0x1dfa200"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>MiniVend is very impressive, almost awesome. This is software
of a kind that other companies ask thousands of dollars (or euros)
for, and MiniVend is free through the GPL. It is also a showpiece,
demonstrating the versatility of Perl. A shopping cart system is
not a small piece of code; MiniVend is a full-featured, powerful
example.</p><p>MiniVend is a big system, not something you can cover in one
session. It has scores of features I didn't even have time to try
out yet. I've had a few problems with it, but I firmly believe that
MiniVend is a system that can be used for any kind of electronic
commerce. As I learn the features and study the code, I will become
more familiar with it and can make it do all the things I want it
to do.</p><p>If you're looking for a turn-key system, MiniVend is not it.
On the other hand, if you are looking for a powerful, flexible and
easy-to-use system, MiniVend is for you. The documentation is
great, the source code is all there and if the support on the
mailing list scales up a bit, there is nothing to fear.</p><p><a href="3301s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3301s1.html" target="_self">Requirements</a></p></div></div>
