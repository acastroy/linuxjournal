past two years. Applications of all kinds have started to show up
in many places, coming from both the Open Source community as well
as commercial vendors. One reason for this recent growth is the
flexibility and extensibility of the native windowing system: the X
Window System, also known as X11. Although end users are the
eventual benefactors of this flexibility, it is the development
side of Linux that will be most interested in one of X11's
least-known extensions&mdash;the X Image Extension.
</p><p>The X Image Extension, as the name implies, is not part of
the core X11 distribution, although any system using X11 Release 6
(aka X11R6) should have this extension included. The X Image
Extension, more commonly known as XIE, provides a mechanism for
graphic image management in the client/server environment of X11.
Image decompression, for example, can be handled on the server side
(the display side) instead of overloading clients with this common
and resource-consuming task.</p><p>Some time back, the author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Developing Imaging
Applications with XIElib</em></span>, Syd Logan, contacted me about
this extension and recommended the GIMP developers take a look at
it. At the time, I was modestly involved in GIMP development, back
in the very early days when the GIMP was still a Motif application.
XIE never really seemed to catch on in the developer community for
the GIMP. Perhaps it was simply because no text was available from
which to learn the API (the applications programming interface or
the interface into XIE's software library). It may also have been
due to the fact that not all developers were on Linux at the time
and not all UNIX vendors had migrated to X11R6, a situation that
continues to this day.</p><p>Despite the GIMP not using XIE, I've still been interested in
what XIE is all about. What can it be used for? How difficult is
adding it to an existing application? Does it help solve some of
the more mundane problems in computer graphics, or is it more
focused on specific types of problems?</p><p>Syd's book is well-organized and provides answers to most of
these questions. The text is thick&mdash;well over 600 pages&mdash;with
chapters ranging from introductions to existing image handling
methods in Xlib to the nuts and bolts of XIE's API and its
underlying data structures. The chapters flow from an overview of
the XIE architecture into high-level concepts such as &ldquo;photoflo
elements&rdquo; and image file formats to more detailed descriptions of
using &ldquo;process elements&rdquo; to do format conversions and the use of
&ldquo;techniques&rdquo;, the algorithms used by the server side for image
processing.</p><p>Even with my self-taught experience in graphics terminology,
I discovered XIE has a whole new set of terms to learn. A fairly
complete glossary of these terms is included at the end of the
text, but you'll find Syd's definitions within the text to be a
better source of information. He does a good job explaining new
terms quickly and fitting them into the larger picture that is
XIE.</p><p>Accompanying the text is a CD with a modest bit of sample
code from the text. The README on the CD is quite extensive and
should be read before trying to build or run any of the software on
the CD. Some of the files on the CD do not have read permissions
for anyone but the file owner, so you'll have to copy the files
from the CD as the root user and then do a
<span   class="bold"><b>chown</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span>
sequence to get them installed properly.</p><p>The libtiff and jpeg libraries, required to build the XIE
samples, don't build easily from the CD. I downloaded the latest
libtiff source from the FTP sites specified in the README file
(found in the libtiff directory on the CD) and replaced the old
version with the new version. I couldn't do that with the JPEG
library, because the main archive location of ftp//ftp.uu.net/
doesn't allow connections from dial-up hosts whose names don't
resolve in DNS. So, I grabbed the source from the GIMP server
(ftp//ftp.gimp.org/pub/libs/). The new versions built much more
easily. I did not, however, install these libraries on my system,
as I already had working versions installed. The /xiesamples
directory hard codes the library paths to these image libraries
(libtiff and libjpeg) to be relative to the samples directory. I
simply built the libraries and then renamed the default directories
(from the archive files) to the directories expected by the XIE CD
software. After this, the CD software built fine.</p><p>The sample software under the /xiesamples directory covers
most, if not all, examples from the text. Since all of the sample
clients on the CD were written on Linux, they all built fine (after
updating the two libraries described previously). Programs here are
small examples of the base features of XIE as described in the
text. From the README file on the CD:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Most of the samples work with gray-scale JPEGs, a
few work with CCITT images stored in TIFF files, PGM, PPM, color
JPEGs, or raw SingleBand (gray-scale) images.</p></blockquote></div><p>Unfortunately, I had problems running these sample programs
on my system. After rereading the README file, I discovered some of
the samples work only on 8-bit PseudoColor visuals. I have my
system running in TrueColor mode. Take a look at the README file
for explanations of each sample; it will tell you if you can
specify a visual and/or the type of color map to use. However, in
my limited tests, the only sample program I was able to run under a
TrueColor visual was the
<span   class="bold"><b>backendtest</b></span> program.
</p><p>Chapter 2 has a fairly good discussion on using Xlib for
image manipulation for anyone who had problems understanding it
from the O'Reilly <span   class="emphasis"><em>Xlib</em></span> manuals. This text is a
programming guide, not a reference guide. To my knowledge, a
printed reference guide for XIE is not yet available.</p><p>Throughout the text, Syd provides examples of how to make XIE
API calls, including well-commented data structures used in the
API. It's obvious Syd understands the ins and outs of the API. He
provides extensive source code examples&mdash;I hardly went through
three pages without seeing at least one snippet of code.</p><p>Plenty of gray-scale example images are printed in the text,
and at least a few of these lose some of their impact without
color. An eight-page color gallery is in the center of the book.
However, these images are useful only for explaining some general
graphics terminology and techniques and are not really descriptive
of XIE itself.</p><p>I found Chapter 15 to be one of the best chapters simply
because of its application to other graphics areas. Color space
conversion is a common task and one that is not well-supported by
many Linux graphics applications. For example, three paragraphs
into this chapter, I learned that</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>YCbCr images represent color and luminosity as
separate channels in the image. Humans are more sensitive to
changes in luminosity than to changes in color, [so] compression
algorithms can apply greater compression ratios to the color bands
than are applied to the luminance band (Y) without degrading the
perceptible quality of the image.</p></blockquote></div><p>This sort of information, while explaining why certain color
spaces are supported by XIE, also provides definitions that are
applicable to other color management tools.
</p><p>One issue not covered well in this text is how XIE might be
used, if it can be used, with tools like OpenGL or Mesa. It might
not make sense to combine the two, but there doesn't seem to be any
mention of how XIE fits into the overall X11 collection of core
features, extensions and third-party graphics libraries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26dc580.0x27d5478"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Syd Logan's text is an extensive work that thoroughly covers
the X Image Extension. Since Syd worked on a sample implementation
of XIE, he is well-qualified to discuss the topic. The question is
whether XIE is the right solution for your imaging tasks. Its
ability to offload some work to the server can be very beneficial.
Granted, my graphics experience is not as extensive as it could be,
but with the runtime size of some X servers already growing to over
20MB on x86 Linux, one has to wonder if XIE is a good idea or not.
A thorough reading of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Developing Imaging Applications
with XIElib</em></span> should help you answer that question.</p></div></div>
