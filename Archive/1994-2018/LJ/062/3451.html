typing articles in my native language is very important for me. On
page four (describing the cover) of the 3/99 issue of
<i  >LJ</i>, you stated that Linux is truly an
international OS. A true statement, but just partially.</p><p>Stephan Kulow, Mathias Elter and I along with many
translators from around the world want to make the KDE environment
internationalized. It works fine for us; we have menu items, and I
can write ISO-8859-2 characters to this localized Kmail window with
no problems. KDE was the first desktop environment in Slovakia,
translated to our language (Windows 95 was not translated; they
just did Windows 98). This is one area in which we are a step
ahead. GNOME, CDE and other desktop systems for UNIX have not been
translated.</p><p>Also, the developers of (mainly) commercial software don't
handle I18N properly, so we must use wrappers for libX11 done by
Stano Meduna, et al. We have some patches that would help I18N in
XFree, for example, but XFree development isn't truly open&mdash;no
reply, no help. No truly usable office software is available under
Linux for our language. For example, Star Office from Star Division
doesn't initialize I18N properly. With wrappers, it works
partially, but when importing MS Word 97 documents, it won't change
the encoding from Windows-1250 to ISO-8859-2, so I am displaying
Windows-1250 with ISO-8859-2 fonts. Export of HTML is done via that
ugly 7-bit convention. Surprisingly, not all characters are working
like this (e.g., l-acute works only in some browsers and doesn't
get exported correctly). WordPerfect took care in providing I18N
support, but it also uses the 7-bit convention for HTML export and
cannot import other HTML encodings (like Unicode). The
import/export of Word works fine, but it is not perfect. The
t-acute and l-acute characters are changed for question marks;
l-acute is probably used only in our language, but programmers
should think about it.</p><p>I am looking for Koffice or some open-source office package
which I could fix to use I18N correctly, or a commercial company
that fixes its errors fast, responds to users and takes care about
their products. We have found, for example, that Red Hat is such a
company. They have incorporated Stano's patches for X and our key
maps into the distribution along with character sets and other
things to help I18N. But they don't make an office suite.</p><p>&mdash;Juraj Bednar bednar@isternet.sk</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x282c580.0x29243a0"></a>Table of Contents for Supplements</h2></div></div><p>Two possible solutions to the weird rules of the Post Office

grain of salt, since it is user opinions based on no investigation
of the specific situation. However, one in March was kind of
appalling. Luis Cardenas asked if PCI modems would work with Linux.
You published a response by Mario Bittencourt that was a very nice,
concise guide to making ISA modems work with
2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> or older kernels.</p><p>Unfortunately, the advice is not at all applicable to PCI
modems and could very well lead people to go out and purchase such
modems, only to find they won't work on Linux.</p><p>Further, the advice is only good for older kernels which
still support the deprecated /dev/cua# devices. It has been
considered bad practice to use these devices for some time, and in
the current kernel they don't exist anymore.</p><p>&mdash;Shawn McMahon smcmahon@eiv.com</p><p>Yes, you are correct&mdash;PCI modems are basically Windows only.
We should have caught that, sorry &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x282c580.0x2924ad8"></a>Kudos to Trident</h2></div></div><p>I am writing to let you know of a recent hardware company's
exceptional support to the GNU/Linux community and the GPL.</p><p>The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture project
(http://alsa.jcu.cz/) is a project designed to build an
architecture for pro-quality sound and MIDI applications, from
low-level drivers for sound and MIDI hardware to high-level
libraries and sequencers. The project is committed to releasing all
work under the GPL.</p><p>As you may know, many sound card manufacturers are reluctant
to give any technical help, and even some of those that offer help
require non-disclosure agreements, which exclude the possibility of
released source. We have blacklisted some companies
(http://alsa.jcu.cz/black.html) which have either refused to
release information or have decided to release binary-only drivers,
which ALSA will not use.</p><p>Trident (http://www.tridentmicro.com/) recently contacted the
ALSA developer mailing list, having written their own drivers for
their 4DWave chip set for ALSA, and offering the source for the
drivers. They graciously allowed all of it to be put under the GPL,
including technical documents.</p><p>I am hoping to drum up support for their hardware in order
for the community to demonstrate how cooperation of this sort can
aid sales. Maybe this will convince more companies to
follow.</p><p>Their chip set is used in the following products. If
GNU/Linux users are looking towards purchasing a sound card,
perhaps they would consider some of the following, since these
cards are well-supported under ALSA.</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x282c580.0x2924d98"></a><p class="title"><b></b></p><table     summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p>Company</p></td><td><p>Product Name</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>=========</p></td><td><p>=============================</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Best</p></td><td><p>Union Miss Melody 4DWave PCI</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>HIS</p></td><td><p>4DWave PCI</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Warpspeed</p></td><td><p>ONSpeed 4DWave PCI</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AzTech</p></td><td><p>PCI 64-Q3D</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Addonics</p></td><td><p>SoundVision (model SV 750)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>CHIC</p></td><td><p>True Sound 4Dwave</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Shark</p></td><td><p>Predator4D-PCI</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jaton</p></td><td><p>SonicWave 4D</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Paradise</p></td><td><p>WaveAudio Interactive (Model AWT4DX)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Promedia</p></td><td><p>Opera CyberPCI-64</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Stark</p></td><td><p>PCI</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>You can read more about ALSA and the call to sound card

company on Macintoshes, and we serve our data from Linux. I was
surprised how easy Linux was to get up and running.</p><p>However, once upon a time there were two UNIX tribes: the
Open Software Foundation and UNIX International. Each tribe was
trying to rubber-stamp UNIX for the masses. As the two camps
fought, a third tribe from the Northwest called Microsoft provided
business with Windows NT. Windows NT did not provide anything
great; in fact, it was largely based on an operating system from
Digital Equipment Corporation called VMS. The UNIX tribes had
beaten this operating system years before.</p><p>Linux has a real opportunity to compete in business beyond
the server. All that is needed is a single standard desktop. Forget
about KDE and GNOME. Merge them, do whatever you must with them,
but get a single desktop environment for which developers can write
applications and users will prosper.</p><p>I am convinced Windows NT cannot serve my business.
Unfortunately, until Linux provides a common desktop, Apple's OS X
may be the only way to finally bring the power of UNIX to the
business user.</p><p>&mdash;Jeff Millard President, SolidVision,

for the Software Professional&rdquo; by P. Tobin McGinnis in
<i  >LJ</i> April 1999. First, I have been working with
PCs since I got my first Apple back in the early 80s. When I went
to college, I started using the x86 platform. After finishing my
college degree, the Air Force sent me to Keesler AFB to teach
computers to new recruits. There I first heard the word
&ldquo;certification&rdquo; in regards to Novell's CNE program. We were
teaching Novell 4.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> to our students. People
started talking about Novell certification, and of how much one
could make if they had this certification. A couple of years later,
I was working as a contractor for the Corp of Engineers in Mobile,
AL on a team that went to field sites to convert Novell servers to
NT. Once again, I heard the certification buzzword, this time from
Microsoft, and the buzz of big money if one had the MCSE
certification.</p><p>People began to scramble to get certified at great cost to
themselves&mdash;$100 US per test, $50 US per book, and in some cases,
thousands of dollars for classes. Now, many of the questions and
answers for these certification tests can be found on the Web.
People are passing the test who have never installed the NT OS. Yet
because they are certified, they are called experts&mdash;their
certificate is meaningless.</p><p>Now I read in <i  >Linux Journal</i> the buzz
about Linux certification. I thought Linux was better than that.
Certification has always been a way for companies to market their
products. The training companies are the only ones getting rich
from certification. Linux has grown exponentially without
certification. I am against certification.</p><p>Please don't promote Linux certification. It will ruin the
Linux movement. The movement was created by people who rebelled
against the likes of MS, Novell and many other companies. Now it
seems we are running to join their ranks with the same
certification nonsense.</p><p>&mdash;Kyle Enlow kenlow@indiana.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x282c580.0x291d468"></a>Linux in Schools</h2></div></div><p>I am writing this after reading the article &ldquo;Linux in a
Public High School&rdquo; by Andrew Feinberg in your March issue. I am
currently one of two system administrators at Bridges Academy,
located in Los Angeles, California. My associate, Brook Elliot, and
I run a Debian 2.0 box with the 2.0.36 kernel. The Linux box runs
on a T1 line, and using DHCP, we enable students to plug in to any
of the Ethernet jacks around the school and check their e-mail or
browse the Web. Although most of these students are using Windows
9<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> machines, a select few of us use the full
Linux potential.</p><p>Both Brook and I are students at this school. We currently
have a web page up for the school at http://www.bridges.edu/, which
runs under Apache.</p><p>&mdash;Matthew Kaufman xel@Bridges.Edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x282c580.0x291d678"></a><span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span> Magazine
Syndrome</h2></div></div><p>Many years ago, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span> magazine was a
technically oriented magazine that I enjoyed reading as I enjoyed
reading the December issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
Early last year, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span> was publishing fluff. I
hope the March 1999 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> is
not an indication of more fluff to come. With the exception of the
GNU <span   class="bold"><b>gettext</b></span> article, where are the
items that show a reader <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> to use a Linux
system in a new or more productive way, to use a new programming
library, to reduce incoming spam, etc.? One or two articles on
interesting uses of Linux is fine (such as &ldquo;Linux for the
