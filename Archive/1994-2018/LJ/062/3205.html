    What should you do if using a single disk or partition for
    the root file system is unacceptable?  Use two or three. This article
    provides a solution for this problem.

Inexpensive Disks&rdquo;. It is meant to speed up and secure disk access
at the same time. RAID, though, is not new. It was invented in 1987
at the University of California, Berkeley. Before Linux, it was
available only in the form of special hardware that was quite
expensive. Of course, it could be used only in high-end computing
centers.
</p><p>During the last decades, performance of processing units has
increased by five to ten times each year, depending on which
statistic you believe. In the same period, disk capacity has
doubled or tripled while prices were halved every one to two years.
Used electronics don't reflect the current processor speed. This
results in I/O being the current bottleneck of modern computers.
Just try to compile our famous XFree86 source on a dumb PII-233
with regular SCSI disk layout.</p><p>By the time people at Berkeley realized this, they were able
to foresee that no new epoch-making technology for hard disks would
be forthcoming in the near future. Since magnetic- and
mechanic-oriented disks were kept and laws of physics permit only
slight improvements, other solutions needed to be found.</p><p>This resulted in the definition of several RAID levels.
Nowadays they are used not only in high-level computer rooms, but
also by the so-called middle-end sector. Since some fellow kernel
hackers decided to implement RAID for the Linux kernel, this
technique can be used by low-end PCs, and regular people can be
satisfied by the improved performance and data security.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3205f1.large.jpg"><img src="3205f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Operation of RAID-5
</p></div></div><p>RAID levels share the following properties:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Several different physical disks are combined and
accessed as a compound element. Under Linux, this is done by the
driver for multiple devices, also known as /dev/md*.</p></li><li><p>The stored data is distributed over all disks in a
well-defined way.</p></li><li><p>The data is stored in a redundant way over the
disks, so in case of failure, data is recoverable.</p></li></ul></div><p>By dividing data into equal chunks and distributing them over
all affected disks, one gets higher I/O performance than by using
only one fast disk. The reason for this is due to ability to
request data from the disks in a parallel fashion. The easiest way
to do this is called striping mode or RAID level 0, but it doesn't
contain any redundancy.
</p><p>Redundancy is achieved in different ways. The simplest is to
store the data on two equal disks. This is defined in RAID-1, also
known as mirroring. Of course, one gets performance increase only
when at least four disks are used.</p><p>More efficient redundancy is obtained when instead of
duplicating all the data, a unique checksum is generated and stored
with regular data. If a single disk should fail, one is able to
reconstruct its data by using all data chunks of that stripe
together with the calculated checksum. The easiest way to calculate
a checksum is to XOR all data chunks in a stripe. This is defined
in RAID levels 4 and 5. The unofficial level 6 uses another chunk
for a different checksum algorithm, resulting in two redundant
disks, and even better breakdown avoidance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x1579c90"></a>How to Set Up RAID</h2></div></div><p>Using file systems with RAID has many advantages. First is
speed. RAID combines several disks and reads/writes chunks from the
disks in sequence. Second, you can get bigger file systems than
your largest disk (useful for /var/spool/news/, /pub/, etc.).
Third, having achieved redundancy means a disk failure won't end up
in data loss. For technical information on RAID, please refer to
ftp://ftp.infodrom.north.de/pub/doc/tech/raid/.</p><p>To use RAID with Linux, you need a kernel with appropriate
support. First of all, this refers to support for the &ldquo;multiple
devices driver&rdquo; (CONFIG_BLK_MD_DEV). Linux
2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> supports linear and striping modes (the
latter is also known as RAID 0). Linux kernel 2.1.63 also supports
RAID levels 1, 4 and 5. If you want to use these levels for
2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, you'll have to install the kernel patch
mentioned at the end of this article.</p><p>To use either, you must activate the appropriate driver in
the kernel. (I'd suggest compiling a kernel of your own anyway.)
Additionally, you need to have special tools installed. For linear
mode and RAID level 0, you need the
<span   class="bold"><b>mdutils</b></span> package that should be
included in your distribution. To use RAID level 1, 4 or 5, you
need to have the <span   class="bold"><b>raidtools</b></span> package
installed, which supersedes the mdutils package.</p><p>Striping works most efficiently if you use partitions of
exactly the same size. Linux's RAID driver will work with different
sizes, too, but is less efficient. In that case, the driver doesn't
use all disks for striping after a certain amount of disk space is
used. The maximum number of disks will be used at any time.</p><p>After setting up RAID and combining several disks to a
compound device, you don't access the disks directly using
/dev/sd*. Instead, you make use of the multiple devices driver that
provides /dev/md*. These devices are block devices just like normal
disks, so you simply create a file system on them and mount.</p><p>The default setup of the Linux kernel provides up to four
such compound devices. Each MD can contain up to eight physical
disks (block devices). If your setup requires either more combined
devices or more compound devices, you have to edit
include/linux/md.h within the Linux kernel source tree, especially
<b  >MAX_REAL</b> and <b  >MAX_MD_DEV</b>. For
testing purposes, you can use some loopback devices instead of
physical disks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x157a160"></a>Swapping over RAID</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3205f2.large.jpg"><img src="3205f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Position of RAID within the Linux Kernel
</p></div></div><p>The Linux kernel includes native support for distributing
swap space over several disks. Instead of setting up a RAID-0
device and directing swap to it, you simply add all swap partitions
to /etc/fstab and use the <b  >swapon&nbsp;-a</b> to
activate them all. The kernel uses striping (RAID-0) for them.
Here's a sample setup:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/sda3  none  swap  sw
/dev/sdb3  none  swap  sw
/dev/sdc3  none  swap  sw
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x157a4d0"></a>Setting Up RAID</h2></div></div><p>Setting up RAID for normal file systems such as /var, /home
or /usr is quite simple. After you have partitioned your disks,
instruct the RAID subsystem on how to organize the partitions. This
information is copied to /etc/mdtab for later activation. It can be
done by issuing the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mdcreate -c4k raid0 /dev/md0 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1\
   /dev/sdc1
</pre><p><a href="3205l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a>
</p><p>If you want to use RAID level 1, 4 or 5, you have to use an
additional configuration file that reflects the disk setup as shown
in Listing 1. These levels are more complicated and need a special
signature on top of the compound device. This signature is
generated by the <span   class="bold"><b>mkraid</b></span> command.
The remaining setup looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkraid /etc/raid/raid5.conf
mdcreate raid5 /dev/md1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1\
   /dev/sdf1 /dev/sdg1 /dev/sdh1
</pre><p>Now two RAIDs have been created; the first consisting of
three partitions, while the second uses five of them. Depending on
the data to be stored on them, different chunk sizes have been
selected. The next step is to activate these devices with the
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mdadd -ar
</pre>


From now on, you may refer to /dev/md0 and /dev/md1 as block
devices that may contain your file systems. In order to use these
devices, issue this command during the boot sequence. Please check
out the startup sequence of your distribution. Some of them (e.g.,
Debian) have already included this line.
</p><p>After the kernel knows how disks are organized, you can
create your file system on the new devices and add them to
/etc/fstab as usual.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1481580.0x157a8f0"></a>Root File System on RAID</h2></div></div><p>The use of RAID for the root file system is a bit tricky. The
problem is LILO can't read and boot the kernel if it is not in a
linear fashion on the disk (as it is on EXT2 or MSDOS file
systems). The solution is to put the kernel on a different
partition with a normal file system and activate RAID after the
kernel is booted.</p><p>This way, LILO would boot the kernel, but the kernel itself
would be unable to mount the root file system because its RAID
subsystem isn't initialized yet. Now you're in trouble, right?
No.</p><p>For late 2.1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernels, a kernel
parameter can be used to load the kernel from a RAID.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
md=&lt;
   &lt;fault level&gt;,dev0,dev1,...,devn
</pre><p>This needs to be added to LILO using the
<b  >append=</b> option or directly at the LILO prompt
during boot stage. You'll find more information in
Documention/md.txt in the Linux source tree.
</p><p>For stable kernels (2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>) and &ldquo;not so
late&rdquo; development kernels (2.1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>), you need a
mechanism to call some programs after the kernel is loaded but
before it tries to mount the root file system. This refers at least
to <span   class="bold"><b>mdadd</b></span>.</p><p>The only way to achieve this is to use the initial RAM disk,
also known as <span   class="bold"><b>initrd</b></span>. General
information about initrd may be found in Documentation/initrc.txt
inside the kernel source tree.</p><p>You will most likely have to compile your own kernel,
although you can try the one included with your distribution if it
contains all facilities. You'll need to add modules support to the
described solution. However, additional kernel compilation options
are needed for the described setup and are shown in Listing 2.
Additionally, you have to include support for your SCSI card, etc.
If you're uncertain about the options, refer to the Kernel-HOWTO
and use <b  >?</b> to display a description of the
referenced driver.</p><p><a href="3205l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a></p><p>If the Linux kernel uses initrd, it mounts the given RAM disk
as root file system and executes /linuxrc if found. Then the kernel
continues its boot process and mounts the real root file system.
The old initrd root will be moved to /initrd if that directory is
available or will be unmounted if not. If it is only moved, the RAM
disk remains in memory. So on systems with little memory, you
should get the kernel to remove it entirely when it is no longer
needed.</p><p>The initrd file is a &ldquo;simple&rdquo; root disk, containing all the
files needed for executing the /linuxrc file. If it is a shell
script, it includes a working shell and all tools used in this
script. In order to execute programs, it also includes a working
libc with ld.so and tools. Alternatively, you can link the included
programs statically and don't need a shared libc. Since this
doesn't save any space, it is not necessary.</p><p>After RAID has been initialized from /linuxrc, you must tell
the kernel where its new root file system resides. At that time, it
may be configured to use initrd as the root file system.
Fortunately, our fellow kernel hackers have designed another easy
interface to set the root file system.</p><p>This facility makes use of the /proc file system. The device
number of the new root file system must be sent (use
<span   class="bold"><b>echo</b></span>) to
/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev, and the kernel continues with that
setting after /linuxrc completes.</p><p>As LILO normally isn't able to boot from a non-linear block
device (such as RAID), you must reserve a small partition with the
kernel and initial RAM disk on it. I've decided to use a 10MB
partition as /boot. Binaries can be stored in this partition and it
can be accessed from a rescue floppy. I wonder why one should use
this since Linux is so stable, but for the sake of security it may
be a good idea.</p><p>10MB is plenty of space for one kernel and a RAM disk of
approximately 1MB in size. Currently, my system uses only 2.5MB of
this space, so plenty of playing room is available. Due to the fact
that /boot uses the normal file system (e.g., EXT2), you can use
/etc/lilo.conf to point to /boot/vmlinuz in your setup.</p><p>Now you need to decide what to do in your /linuxrc script.
Basically, activate RAID and tell the kernel where your root file
system resides. Listing 3 shows an example /linuxrc program.</p><p><a href="3205l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.</a></p><p>Any block device can be used as the root file system. In the
given example, 0x900 is used. This stands for major number 9 and
minor number 0, which is the encoding for /dev/md0.</p><p>Next, make a list of binaries and additional files needed,
including some device files in /dev. To get the /linuxrc script
working, you need /dev/tty1. Other necessary devices depend on your
/etc/mdtab file. You will need at least /dev/md0.</p><p>The above example uses these binaries: ash, mount, umount and
mdadd. These files are also needed: mdtab, fstab, mtab and
passwd.</p><p><a href="3205l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.</a></p><p>The mdtab file I use is shown in Listing 4. For my file,
these block devices must be created on the initial RAM disk:
/dev/hda2, /dev/hda4, /dev/hdb2, /dev/hdb4, /dev/md0, /dev/md1,
/dev/md2 and /dev/md3. Use the
<span   class="bold"><b>mknod</b></span> command to create these
device files. You'll find their major and minor numbers by
investigating your /dev directory or by reading
Documentation/devices.txt from the kernel's source directory. The
following commands create tty1 and md0:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mknod dev/tty1 c 4 1
mknod dev/md0 b 9 0
</pre><p>The best way to create the initial RAM disk is to create the
directory /tmp/initrd and install everything you need in it. Once
you have done that, determine the used disk space
(<b  >du&nbsp;-s</b>), then create the initrd file. The
following commands will create an initial RAM disk 1MB in size. To
use it, your kernel must include support for the loopback device.
<pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/initrd.bin bs=1024k\
   count=1
mke2fs /tmp/initrd.bin
mount -o loop /mnt /tmp/initrd.bin
</pre>


Since dynamically linked binaries are used, the Linker and the
dynamic libraries must also be installed, at least /lib/libc*.so,
/lib/ld-linux.so.2, /lib/ld-2.0.*.so and an appropriate
/etc/ld.so.config file&mdash;appropriate means that
<b  >/lib</b> should be the only line in the file. Create
a new library cache /etc/ld.so.cache file with the command
<pre     class="programlisting">
ldconfig&lt;\!s&gt;-r&lt;\!s&gt;/tmp/initrd
</pre>


and install the needed binaries in appropriate directories: /sbin
or /bin.
</p><p>Don't forget to create the /proc directory, or the mount will
fail. The fstab and mtab files can be empty and read-only, but must
exist on the initial RAM disk. No program will attempt to write to
these two files. For the /etc/passwd file, it's sufficient to
include only the root user.</p><p>After you have copied everything from /tmp/initrd to the RAM
disk mounted at /mnt (see above), unmount it (e.g., with the
command <b  >umount&nbsp;/mnt</b>) and move the file to
/boot/initrd.bin. Now tell LILO to load the kernel and the RAM
disk, using a record in /etc/lilo.conf similar to the one shown in
Listing 5.</p><p><a href="3205l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5.</a></p><p>Issue the <span   class="bold"><b>lilo</b></span> command, and
you are almost done. Since the RAID subsystem is now configured at
boot stage before any /etc/init.d scripts are issued, you should
disable the mdadd call in the /etc/init.d scripts.</p><p>This setup implies you have a running Linux system installed
on some non-RAID disk. At least install a small base system on your
swap partitions, compile the kernel on a different machine, set up
RAID on the appropriate machine, move the files and continue
installation afterwards.</p><p><a href="3205s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
