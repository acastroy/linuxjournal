source of confusion, standards are one of the enabling factors

likely be a small footnote in the history of operating systems.

recent, precipitated by the upswing in commercial interest.
However, before Linux was even named, conformance to an open
standard was an important goal. Here is one of the first postings
by Linus Torvalds about a project that would soon be named
Linux:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
From: torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI
        (Linus Benedict Torvalds)
Newsgroups: comp.os.minix
Subject: Gcc-1.40 and a POSIX-question
Date: 3 Jul 91 10:00:50 GMT
Due to a project I'm working on (in minix),
I'm interested in the POSIX standard definition.
Could somebody please point me to a (preferably)
machine-readable format of the latest POSIX rules?
FTP sites would be nice.
</pre><p>A month later, Linus posted:
<pre     class="programlisting">
As to POSIX, I'd be delighted to have it,
but POSIX wants money for their papers, so that's
not currently an option.
</pre>


Despite the high cost of a copy of the POSIX standard in 1991, it
became one of the primary standards for Linux. POSIX, the Portable
Operating System Interface, is a standard application programming
interface (API) used by Linux and many other operating systems
(typically UNIX and UNIX-like systems). There are several major
benefits to using the interface defined by POSIX. It makes it
easier to write source code that can be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>compiled</em></span> on different POSIX systems. It also
gives Linux application developers and Linux kernel developers a
well-defined API to share. That means application developers don't
need to track most kernel changes as long as the kernel continues
to behave as POSIX says it should.
</p><p>In addition, using POSIX as the API for Linux enabled Linus
and other early Linux developers to use existing free programs
written by the GNU Project, the BSD operating system and many other
free programs which adhere to the POSIX specification.</p><p>It is important to note that POSIX does not provide for
precompiled binary applications to be run on any POSIX operating
system. Since it provides source code compatibility, but not binary
compatibility, POSIX is often thought of as a <span   class="emphasis"><em>source
standard</em></span>. Early development of Linux was made under the
Minix operating system. In fact, Linus originally wanted to make
Linux binary-compatible with Minix. That idea was dropped when the
differences between Linux and Minix became too great, but some
traces of the Minix heritage of Linux still linger here and
there.</p><p>When asked about the importance of POSIX in early Linux
development, Linus Torvalds said, &ldquo;Linux started out
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> aware of POSIX, but even more so of the
unofficial de facto standards.&rdquo; He elaborated that, at the time,
these de facto standards were approximately SunOS (the precursor to
Solaris) behavior, somewhere between BSD and System V. &ldquo;Basically,
I wanted to not have to spend too much time porting user mode
programs (it wasn't something I was all that interested in), and
POSIX helped in that,&rdquo; Torvalds said.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b1580.0x19a9920"></a>Linux Today</h2></div></div><p>POSIX.1 (the POSIX kernel interface) is still considered by
Linus Torvalds and other kernel developers to be the &ldquo;base
standard&rdquo; for the kernel. Some later additions to the POSIX
specification have not been as useful as POSIX.1, and design issues
often have to be resolved before Linux can make use of a standard.
Linus describes one of the best examples of such a design
decision:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Often there are standards that are too generic to
be very useful as a guide for the kernel. The &ldquo;pthreads&rdquo; POSIX
threads standard is one example: some people have tried to
implement their kernel threading model according to it, and the
standard simply is not very well suited to that.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Even in that case, I still wanted to support the
standard; I just did not want to <span   class="emphasis"><em>natively</em></span>
implement the standard as-is. So Linux
<span   class="bold"><b>clone</b></span> was created: the
infrastructure to do threading under Linux, on top of which you can
implement pthreads and also other threading models.</p></blockquote></div><p>It is difficult to list all of the other standards used today
by Linux. TCP/IP, Ethernet and other formal and de facto standards
form the basis for networking in Linux. The IBM PC is one of the
best examples of a de facto standard. (This standard is now more
formalized.) The PC allowed thousands, and then millions, of people
to run Linux on a system typically used for Microsoft Windows. It
is a lot easier to take over the world if you run on the standard
hardware of the day. Just as significant, the GNU C compiler
(without which there would be no Linux) is built on top of the
K&amp;R (Kernigan &amp; Ritchie) and ANSI C standards.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b1580.0x19a9c90"></a>Common Implementation</h2></div></div><p>In addition to formal standards like POSIX and ANSI C, one of
the most prevalent types of standards used by Linux systems is a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>common implementation</em></span>. The best example, of
course, is the Linux kernel. No written specification is available
for many of the interfaces provided by the kernel. However, no
specification is needed because only one strain of kernel is
accepted by everyone (not just all distributions or all developers,
but truly <span   class="emphasis"><em>everyone</em></span>). Want to know the
standard? Read the kernel source.</p><p>While not always quite as clear-cut, many more examples of
common implementation standards are accepted by the entire Linux
community, or at least a large chunk of it. Take the utilities and
programs provided by the GNU Project. For example, it has long been
accepted that the utility <span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> is
the enhanced GNU version, not the BSD one or some other version. If
you are writing an application for Linux only, it is probably safe
to rely on most of the functionality provided by GNU find. Because
so many GNU utilities like this are used, Richard Stallman, founder
of the GNU Project, insists that people refer to Linux as
&ldquo;GNU/Linux&rdquo; or as a &ldquo;Linux-based GNU system&rdquo;. This tends to
upset many people, but most developers seem to recognize Stallman's
immense contribution and don't make a big fuss about it, even if
most of them still say &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;.</p><p>The GNU project's share in the success of Linux does not end
there. Linux has now standardized on the GNU C library (glibc) as
the common implementation for future Linux systems. The glibc
project aims for compliance with several standards. According to
Ulrich Drepper, the GNU libc maintainer, all of the important
standards are supported as long as they don't conflict with common
sense. That list includes ISO C 90, ISO C 9x, POSIX and UNIX
98.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b1580.0x19a9f50"></a>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</h2></div></div><p>What if there is not a common implementation, a formal
standard, or even an informal, de facto or ad hoc standard? One
thing you can do is try to pick the best and most common practices
and base a standard on them.</p><p>The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) was among the first
written standards developed specifically for Linux. The FHS aims to
standardize the locations where files and directories are placed in
the system. Standard locations are needed so that applications can
be compiled and run well on different Linux distributions; it is
also helpful for developers. If you want to write documentation for
Linux, or if you need to work on more than one variety of Linux, it
is invaluable knowing you can expect to find important files and
directories in a standard location.</p><p>If you are wondering why a standard such as POSIX could not
be adopted, the reason is one did not exist. Each UNIX vendor had
its own solution, and there was a great deal of overlap, but the
specifications and rationale for each vendor's layout were either
lacking or nonexistent. Unfortunately, no multi-vendor standard was
available for a standard layout of files and directories.</p><p>The FHS was started in 1993. At the time, the Linux OS was
approximately two years old. As he does today, Linus dictated how
things would work in the Linux kernel and did not exert much
influence on other areas of the Linux operating system. With no
central authority for those other areas, a number of Linux
distributions had considerably different layouts. Some were like
the BSD operating system, others were more like SunOS, and others
were different still. (Incidentally, most of the names of the big
distributions back then were different from the ones we hear today:
Debian, Linux/PRO, MCC, Slackware, SLS, TAMU, Yggdrasil,
etc.)</p><p>The first version of the FHS was based on ideas from SunOS 4,
SVR4, 4.3BSD, 4.4BSD, SunOS 4, HP-UX and many other UNIX systems,
but it was also based as much as possible on common practices
distilled from the various Linux distributions existing at the
time. The completed specification attempted to take the best of
each file-system layout and combine them into a solution that
worked well.</p><p>Since then, subsequent releases of the FHS have been
refinements of the original specification, importing a few
additional ideas from other areas (including 4.4BSD and
SVR4).</p><p>Today, most Linux distributions follow FSSTND 1.2 (the
precursor to FHS 2.0). They do this not because they are forced to,
but because it cleanly addresses a problem they were having. FHS
2.1 should be available by the time this article is
published.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b1580.0x19aa268"></a>Linux Standard Base</h2></div></div><p>The widespread availability of third-party commercial
software for Linux is a relatively new phenomenon. Many vendors are
faced with a problem they have never seen before.</p><p>At one time, all the software on your Linux box generally
came from one of two places. Either it came with the distribution,
or someone (you, a friend, maybe even a system administrator)
compiled it from the source and installed it locally. Distributions
are very good at integrating software and making sure everything
works together. Assuming someone had the expertise, it is possible
to get even a sub-standard program compiled and installed for your
Linux boxes.</p><p>What if someone else wants to give you a pre-compiled binary
package to install on your system? They are forced to consider
which distribution you run, what version of the distribution, your
kernel version, and a slew of other considerations before they can
be reasonably certain that the application will install correctly
on your system and work. If the goal is to provide a binary package
for everyone, it is even worse. You must tailor the application for
any and all distributions, and then compile, build and test it on
each one, too. Is it any surprise that few vendors support even
three or four of the major Linux distributions for their
applications?</p><p>One of the more common fears about Linux is that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fragmentation</em></span> will occur because it uses an
open-development model. As in real life, fragmentation occurs when
something breaks into many different pieces which are no longer
connected. Fragmentation is not a new phenomenon in the
free-software community. Sometimes it happens for good reasons,
perhaps when a maintainer is not doing a good job. Sometimes it
happens for less worthy reasons, such as a personality conflict
between lead developers.</p><p>This has happened before. A graphical-oriented version of the
GNU Emacs editor called <span   class="emphasis"><em>XEmacs</em></span> split off of
the version maintained by the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
because of technical differences between the FSF and the developers
of Lucid Emacs (the predecessor to XEmacs). The XEmacs FAQ does not
take a rosy view of the situation:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>There are currently irreconcilable differences in
the views about technical, programming, design and organizational
matters between RMS [Richard Stallman] and the XEmacs development
team which provide little hope for a merge to take place in the
short-term future.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If you have a comment to add regarding the merge,
it is a good idea to avoid posting to the newsgroups, because of
the very heated flame wars that often result.</p></blockquote></div><p>When there is a split like this, it usually has the most
impact on the end user. Add-on packages work with one variety of
the software, but might not work with another. That is more or less
what happened to GNU Emacs, although developers try to compensate
for it as best they can.
</p><p>A small amount of fragmentation, such as the difference
between Linux distributions, is good because it allows them to
cater to different segments of the community. Because Linux is Open
Source, different distributions have the freedom to be unique. For
example, the Extreme Linux distribution targets high-performance
clusters of Linux PCs running the Beowulf clustering software.
Rather than a single all-in-one distribution, each distribution can
target a segment of the Linux community and try to meet that
segment's needs better than any other distribution. Users benefit
by getting a Linux distribution that more closely meets their needs
than is possible under a single distribution model.</p><p>Also important is the attitude about fragmentation in the
Linux community. Everyone is concerned that fragmentation could
become a problem, and wants to ensure that applications can run on
any variety of Linux. That is where the Linux Standard Base (LSB)
is involved. The LSB project is working to define a common subset
of Linux that everyone can count on, independent of the
distribution. By defining only what can be expected in a minimal
base Linux system, the LSB is attempting to find a balance between
stifling Linux development and the possibility of Linux fragmenting
into several totally incompatible versions.</p><p>The main problem the LSB is addressing is that software
vendors must port and test their software on multiple Linux
distributions, because even a small difference between
distributions can result in major problems for the software when
the vendor's software has been based on the behavior of one
distribution. The difficulties ultimately affect everyone: users,
developers, application vendors, Linux companies, et al.</p><p>Aside from the danger of fragmentation (which, by the way,
Linux has avoided for the last eight years without an LSB), there
are secondary dangers, namely FUD&mdash;fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
The LSB hopes that by making fragmentation a remote possibility, it
will help bolster confidence and win support for Linux from even
the most conservative sectors. How will it do that? The Linux
Standard Base Goals are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Enable software applications to run on any
LSB-compliant distribution.</p></li><li><p>Increase compatibility among Linux
distributions.</p></li><li><p>Help support software vendors and developers to
port and write software for Linux.</p></li></ul></div><p>Those are the things the LSB developers want to do. On the
other hand, we want to avoid some things. Our LSB Guidelines for
Success include:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Don't tread on distributions&mdash;everyone wants them
to be unique.</p></li><li><p>Do no more than what is required to solve the basic
problem of application portability.</p></li><li><p>Don't break old systems or prevent future
advances.</p></li></ul></div>

LSB intends to generate a written specification for what
distributions should provide and what application vendors can
expect in a base system, and provide a test suite and sample
implementation of the base system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b1580.0x1da3010"></a>Linux and Future Standards</h2></div></div><p>Is it enough for Linux developers to make their own way based
on standards developed by outside groups such as the IEEE, The Open
Group, ISO and ANSI? Probably not. Linux developers have been able
to pick and choose which standards to adopt and how to implement
them, but as standards are revised and extended, Linux developers
want to ensure future standards also meet their needs.</p><p>One such revision in progress is a joint revision of the
POSIX standards by the IEEE, The Open Group and ISO. The group
revising the standard is known as the Austin Group. Unlike previous
POSIX standards, the goal is a common set of documents shared by
all three organizations. USENIX, the Advanced Computing Systems
Association, is helping to fund two Linux developers to attend
meetings and participate in the revision. The two developers are
Ulrich Drepper, the glibc maintainer, and H. Peter Anvin, author of
the kernel automounter and maintainer of the Linux device list. The
POSIX revision, Ulrich says, will throw away or at least make
optional some of the less wanted parts of the old standards (such
as STREAMS). This is a good thing for Linux because those parts
have not been adopted by the entire Linux community. The result is
that fuller compliance with POSIX will become more likely.</p><p>In addition, Ulrich adds, there are functions he would like
to see standardized in the new POSIX specification. Some of those
function specifications may come directly from the glibc project.
If that happens, maybe some future operating system can put some of
the standardization blame on Linux.</p><p><a href="3417s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
