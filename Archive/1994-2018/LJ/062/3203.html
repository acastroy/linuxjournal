    Sybase comes to Linux&mdash;here's how it works.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18bb580.0x19b33f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Sybase has released their SQL Database
product for Linux. This is a port of their full commercial database
product&mdash;it is not crippled in any way. This series of articles
will describe how to install and configure the server and how to
set up and use clients. It would be impossible to teach everything
about developing and maintaining client-server applications in a
short series of articles, but these should get you started.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18bb580.0x19b3500"></a>What is the Sybase SQL Server?</h2></div></div><p>The Sybase SQL Server is an industrial-strength client-server
database engine. It manages data and allows many clients to access
this data efficiently and securely. The Sybase SQL Server allows
you to concentrate on writing your application rather than on
writing data access and security code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18bb580.0x19b3608"></a>Installing the Sybase SQL Server</h2></div></div><p>Before installing the server, you must determine if your
system can handle it. The server with all the documentation will
require approximately 180MB of disk space plus space for your
databases. A running server will take a minimum of 21MB of RAM. If
you have many clients, you should give your server much more RAM;
so for small development systems, a minimum of 32MB is required.
For small-scale production servers, I would suggest a minimum of
64MB of RAM. As usual, the more RAM you give it, the faster it
runs.</p><p>I have installed the server on numerous Red Hat 5.1 systems,
as it requires the newer glibc libraries. If you have an older
Linux installation that does not include the glibc libraries (Red
Hat 4.2 and below), you should upgrade your system. If you have a
non-Red Hat system, you will also need an RPM tool to install the
files. The server is distributed as two RPM files. According to the
Sybase Linux web page (http://linux.sybase.com/), you can install
the server only on Red Hat Linux 5.x and Caldera OpenLinux 1.3. In
my opinion, you could install it on any Linux system&mdash;it would just
be a bit more difficult than if you are using the Red Hat or
Caldera version.</p><p>The web URL to access these files is
http://linux.sybase.com/. This site will point you to one of the
sites that offers the files for download. Remember this site&mdash;it
contains important information you will need when using your SQL
Server. After entering your registration information, you will be
able to download two RPM files: one containing the Sybase SQL
Server, the other with documentation in HTML and PostScript. This
is approximately 40MB of data, so if you have a slow Internet
connection, be prepared to wait a while. Fortunately, installing
the software will take much less time than downloading it.</p><p>To install the server, log in to your Linux system as root
and type the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -i sybase-ase-11.0.3.3-1.i386.rpm
</pre><p>You will be asked to read the license agreement; then it will
install the Sybase server to the /opt/sybase directory. On my
system, this is a problem because I usually don't have enough space
on the partition to hold /opt/sybase, so I make a link that
redirects /opt to /usr/local before installing. This works because
it doesn't matter where the software is installed&mdash;it will work
from any directory. From now on, I'll assume you have installed the
server in its default location.
</p><p>During the installation, you will be asked to create a group
named <b  >sybase</b> and a user named
<b  >sybase</b>. You will use the
<b  >sybase</b> user to perform maintenance on the
database server. All users who need access to the Sybase server
should be members of the group named
<b  >sybase</b>.</p><p>Now install the documentation files by running the following
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -i sybase-doc-11.0.3.3-1.i386.rpm
</pre><p>One thing the installation does not do is set the owner of
the files correctly. While you are still logged in as root, issue
the following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chown -R sybase:sybase /opt/sybase
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18bb580.0x19b3be0"></a>Configuring the Sybase Server</h2></div></div><p>Now that all the files are installed on your system, it is
time to configure an SQL server and a backup server. A backup
server is used to back up data in the SQL server while the SQL
server is running. It guarantees that when restored, your database
will have the proper integrity. Copying your database files from
the operating system will not guarantee that your database tables
will be restored properly.</p><p>A single host can have multiple SQL servers if necessary. I
would not recommend doing so, but it is an option. For our example,
we will configure a single SQL server and a single backup server on
our host.</p><p>Log in as the user <b  >sybase</b> using the
password you set when installing the SQL server. Since it is your
first login as the <b  >sybase</b> user, the login script
will ask if you would like to run
<span   class="bold"><b>sybinit</b></span>. The sybinit program is
used to configure new and existing Sybase servers and is located in
the /opt/sybase/install directory.</p><p>If you installed the documentation, you can follow along with
the installation by using your browser and accessing the file
/opt/sybase/doc/howto/howto-ase-quickstart.html. There isn't room
in the magazine to display all the screens you will see. These
screens are documented in the Quickstart Guide that comes with the
server.</p><p>The first option you should pick is option 3, &ldquo;Configure a
Server product&rdquo;. Configure the SQL Server first by selecting
option 1. Since this is a new server, select option 1 again. Each
server should have a unique name. I recommend naming the server
based on its function. For example, a production decision support
server could be named dss_prod. A development accounting server
could be named acctng_dev. For this example, name the server
linux_dev. When you finish filling in the data for a screen, press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> to save your data. Press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> now. At this point, nine more steps are
required to configure this SQL server.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Select option 1</b></span>. The
interfaces file tells Sybase products where servers are located.
Each server will listen on a specific port on its host. Just like
SMTP mail, TELNET and web services, Sybase servers need a unique
port to allow network connections. The interface file will hold the
server name, host name and port number for each sybase server on
your network. Select option 3 to add the port information for the
linux_dev server. The sybinit program will automatically fill in
the host name for your host. You should specify the TCP/IP port
your server will listen on. For this example, select option 2, then
specify 2360 as the port number. Any unused port will work. Press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> to save this entry in the interfaces
file. After you confirm that everything is correct, press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> again.</p><p>If you have multiple sybase servers that you access, you can
add information for each server into your interfaces file.</p><p>Before continuing, a little background information will be
helpful. Database tables will hold the data for your application.
For example, an accounts payable application would have an invoice
table, a vendor table and a payment table. A database can hold many
tables. A Sybase server will have multiple databases. An accounting
application might have general ledger, accounts payable and
accounts receivable databases. When a server is installed, it will
have four databases:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>master</b></span>: The master
database holds configuration data for the entire server.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>model</b></span>: The model
database is the basis for all new databases created on the
server.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>sybsystemprocs</b></span>:
The sybsystemprocs database holds stored procedures used to
maintain the server.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>tempdb</b></span>: The tempdb
database is a temporary workspace used when processing
queries.</p></li></ul></div><p>The sybase server manages disk space in devices. A device is
a pre-allocated file of a specific size. A device file can be up to
2GB. A single server can have many devices. Databases are created
on devices.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Select option 2</b></span>. The master
device holds the master database, the model database and the tempdb
database. Its default size is 21MB. You can move the location of
this file if you wish. If you have enough disk space, you can leave
it in its current location. Press <b  >ctrl-A</b> to save
this screen. The sybinit program will give you a warning about the
file name you selected. This is normal; on Linux, it will always
give this warning. On other UNIX operating systems, the Sybase
server devices should be raw partitions on the disk. This isn't
possible on the current version of Linux, so we have to put our
devices in operating system files.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Select option 3</b></span>. The
sybsystemprocs database contains stored procedures used to maintain
the server. This database can also be used to store any procedures
you write for server maintenance. I recommend you double the size
of this database, so that you can add additional stored procedures
to your server. When you do this, you have to select option 5 to
increase the size of the device before you select option 1 to
increase the size of the database. Put 32MB for options 5 and 1.
You can leave the rest of the options as they are, unless you would
like to place the device file in a different location. Press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> to save this screen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Select option 4</b></span>. As the
server runs, it writes error messages to a text log file. This
screen lets you set the location and name of this file. I recommend
you give this file the same name as the database server. Change
option 1 to /opt/sybase/install/linux_dev.log. Press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> to save this screen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Select option 5</b></span>. The
database server needs to know the name of its backup server. I
always give the backup server the same name as the database server,
with _bs on the end. Change option 1 to linux_dev_bs. Press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> to save this screen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Select option 6</b></span>. The server
can use many languages. I have never used anything other than
us_english, so I can't tell you what will happen when choosing
another language. For our example, just press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> to save the default for this
screen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Select option 7</b></span>. You can
configure which character set to use when communicating between a
client and the server. Each client will tell the server which
character set it should use. If you do not know for sure that you
need another character set, you should accept the defaults for this
screen. Press <b  >ctrl-A</b> to save this screen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Select option 8</b></span>. Here you
can specify which order to use when sorting data. By default, the
server uses a binary order when sorting. This is the fastest sort
method; however, when sorting words that are upper and lower case,
the server uses the ASCII character set to sort so that uppercase
letters are sorted before lowercase letters. Change the sort order
to the dictionary sort order so that words are sorted properly
regardless of case. Press <b  >ctrl-A</b>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Select option 9</b></span>. If you
wish, you can have the server maintain auditing information about
users. For our example, we won't install auditing. Press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> to configure the server to not maintain
auditing records.</p><p>We have now told the sybinit program everything it needs to
know to configure your SQL server. Press <b  >ctrl-A</b>
to save your configuration. The sybinit program will now configure
your SQL server. It will warn you about the master device file
again, but it will create the devices and prepare the server for
use. Your new SQL database server is now running on your
system.</p><p>Press <b  >ctrl-A</b> to go to the previous screen.
The next step is to configure a new backup server. Select option 2,
then option 1 to configure a new backup server. The name of the
backup server should be linux_dev_bs. Press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> to save the backup server name.</p><p>I recommend changing the name of the backup server log file
to /opt/sybase/install/linux_dev_bs.log. This server needs to be
specified in the interfaces file also. It will listen on its own
unique port. Select option 2. Select option 3 to add a new
listener. As before, the host name has already been specified.
Change option 2 to 2361. This will be the port for the backup
server. Press <b  >ctrl-A</b> to save this screen. Press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> again to write this entry in the
interfaces file.</p><p>Everything else should be correct, so press
<b  >ctrl-A</b> to save this screen. The sybinit program
will now configure the backup server and start it for you. Both the
SQL server and the backup server should now be running on your
host.</p><p>We are almost done, but there are three steps we need to
finish. Press <b  >ctrl-A</b> to go to the previous
screen. Select option 4, &ldquo;Configure an Open Client/Server
Product&rdquo;. These three products should be configured before you use
them. To be honest, I don't know what configuring these products
does because no options are available and they seem to work before
configuring; however, it can't hurt to follow the directions.
Select each of the three options one after the other to configure
them. When you are finished, press <b  >ctrl-A</b> to
leave this screen. Press <b  >ctrl-A</b> again to leave
the sybinit program.</p><p>All of your entries are recorded in a log file. If you are
configuring a production system, print this log file and keep it on
hand in case you need to recreate the server that crashed at two in
the morning.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18bb580.0x1dad698"></a>Testing the Server</h2></div></div><p>There is a basic client that comes with the Sybase SQL
Server. This program is called
<span   class="bold"><b>isql</b></span>. It is an interactive SQL
program that allows you to enter SQL commands to the server and see
the results. At the command line, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
isql -Usa -Slinux_dev
</pre><p>The <b  >-U</b> option tells the isql program which
user name to use; <b  >sa</b> is the system administrator
account. It is similar to root on Linux. It has all rights in the
server. The <b  >-S</b> option specifies to which server
to connect. In our case, the server name is linux_dev. The isql
program will ask you for a password. Right after an installation,
the sa user does not have a password, so just press enter. You can
now enter SQL commands that will run on your SQL server.
</p><p>The first command to run is a stored procedure that lets you
change the password of a user. At the 1&gt; prompt, type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sp_password null,'
</pre><p><b  >sp_password</b> is the name of the stored
procedure. The sa user has no password, so we pass
<b  >null</b> as the first parameter. This parameter
should be the password of the current user. The second parameter is
the new password; put this password in quotes.
</p><p>At the 2&gt; prompt, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
go
</pre><p><b  >go</b> tells the isql program to execute the
command. If you make a mistake while typing a command before typing
<b  >go</b>, you can type <b  >reset</b> to
erase the command and try again.
</p><p>All of the configuration information for the SQL server is
stored in tables in the master database. Type the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1&gt; select name from sysdatabases
2&gt; go
</pre><p>This is an SQL command that queries the sysdatabases table.
It will list the names of all the databases in your server. Almost
all of the configuration information for the SQL server is stored
in database tables. The documentation will give you more
information on these tables.
</p><p>To quit the isql program, type <b  >quit</b> at the
1&gt; prompt.</p><p>The SQL server comes with a script that will install an
example database on your server. To install this database, type the
following command at the $ prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sql -Usa -i ~sybase/scripts/installpubs2 \
   -Slinux_dev
</pre><p>Type your new password when prompted. The script will create
a database called pubs2, then create tables with data in them. You
can now type queries like the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
isql -Usa -Slinux_dev
Password:
1&gt; use pubs2
2&gt; go
1&gt; select * from authors
2&gt; go
au_id  au_lname    ...

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18bb580.0x1dae090"></a>Shutting Down the Servers</h2></div></div><p>Before you shut down your Linux system, you should shut down
your Sybase servers. Do this using the isql program. Log in as the
sa user to shut down the server. Once you are in isql, type
<b  >shutdown&nbsp;SYB_BACKUP</b> to shut down the backup
server. <b  >SYB_BACKUP</b> is the default name for a
backup server. Then type <b  >shutdown</b> to shut down
the SQL server; this will remove both servers from memory. Now you
can shut down your Linux system. If you don't shut down the servers
properly, you could corrupt data. I recommend writing a script to
perform this task automatically.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18bb580.0x1dae2a0"></a>Starting the Servers</h2></div></div><p>To start up the servers, you need to be logged in as the user
<b  >sybase</b>. Change to the install directory and
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ./startserver -f ./RUN_linux_dev
</pre><p>to start the SQL server and then
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ./startserver -f
./RUN_linux_dev_bs
</pre>


to start the backup server. A startup script named
/etc/rc.d/init.d/sybase is installed on your system. You can link
this script to the proper places in your rc.d directories so the
server will automatically start and stop when you start and stop
your Linux system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18bb580.0x1dae508"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>You have installed the SQL server and the backup server and
you know how to start and stop it. There is still more to learn
about the server. At the end of this article is a list of resources
that can help you learn about your new Sybase SQL server. I
recommend reading the PostScript documentation that comes with the
server. If you don't want to print the hundreds of pages of
documentation, you can use
<span   class="bold"><b>ghostscript</b></span> to view them. For an
easier way to view the documentation, go to
http://sybooks.sybase.com/dynaweb and select Sybase Version 11.0.x
Products. You can read all the documentation via Sybase's web
site.</p><p>Next month's installment will be about writing database
clients and installing the Sybase extension for Perl
