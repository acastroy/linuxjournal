seems to create a storm of controversy whenever it is spoken.
Everyone agrees it is a good thing, but no one agrees on what
standards should encompass or how they should be enforced. Whether
for auto parts or operating systems, standardization can be a big
plus for the consumer.
</p><p>The Linux operating system, unlike other software products,
has multiple sources&mdash;each distribution represents a different
implementation. The differences are generally in the installation
software and methods (RPM vs. DEB packages, for example); however,
nothing is currently in place to prevent a company from adding a
feature to the operating system and still call it Linux. Other
companies are free to adopt the feature, but this is not
required.</p><p>This month, we look at the Linux standardization efforts. Two
things are very clear in the standards debate:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Distributions want to remain unique in order to
maintain marketplace advantage.</p></li><li><p>Users and manufacturers of applications software
(ISVs) want applications that will run on whichever distribution
they own, i.e., they want applications to run on all
distributions.</p></li></ul></div><p>These two things are not mutually exclusive. After all, users
do not want one distribution to become the Linux &ldquo;Microsoft&rdquo; (it
might be one other than their favorite), so users too are all for
uniqueness in distributions. And no distribution wants to be the
odd man out&mdash;the distribution on which a major application doesn't
work; so, the distributions also are for compatibility. Developers
more than anyone want standards that will enable them to write
programs that will work across all distributions without hassle.
Thus, it appears as if all sides have a common ground on which to
meet.
</p><p>Setting and following standards is the only way to ever
ensure cross-distribution compatibility for applications. However,
standards that are defined in a rigid and finely detailed manner
will be ignored by developers as unrealistic and difficult to
follow. Finding that optimum position between standards that are
too lax and those that are too rigid is the laudable goal of the
Linux Standards Base Project. Dan Quinlan, the project leader,
tells us about the plans of the LSB in his article in this
issue.</p><p>To find out where all the distributions stand on this issue,
Norman Jacobowitz talked to representatives of each by e-mail and
at the LinuxWorld Expo. Some were more forthcoming than others; see
who said what in Norman's article this month.</p><p>Want to express your opinions? Join the discussion groups on
