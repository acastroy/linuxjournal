linux.com domain and hired Trae McCombs to be the site manager. I
talked to Trae on April 1 to find out his plans.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Tell us how you came
to work on the linux.com site.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Trae</b></span>: I am constantly amazed
I have a job at VA Research. I never graduated from college and I
spent four years in the military. At one time, I even had a
climbing guide service and taught climbing. In March of 1995, I
bought my first computer. I ran Windows for about a year and
discovered very quickly that I wanted something else. Then I saw a
screen shot of Linux&mdash;an old version of Enlightenment called
FVWM-XPM&mdash;and thought, &ldquo;I wanna run that!&rdquo; I actually started
running Linux because it was pretty!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Now that's a Linux
story I haven't heard before.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Trae</b></span>: I know! That was
September of 1996, and getting started was pretty hard for me. I
think I was the first non-geek, non-technical person to use Linux.
Other users told me about RPM and
configure-&gt;<b  >make-&gt;</b>make install. I have no
programming skills&mdash;I couldn't code to save my life!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: So what are you
doing working for VA Research?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Trae</b></span>: That's an interesting
question! They hired me for this position because of what I did for
the themes.org site. I talked to all the major window manager
authors about setting up an official theme site for their window
manager. After getting their approval, I started building this huge
themes repository for the Linux community. I couldn't have done it
alone&mdash;I built a staff of about 18 volunteers who I managed. I
think Larry Augustin was impressed with how I managed that site,
and that's why he hired me.</p><p>For linux.com, I'm using that same model. To develop the web
site, I have 13 volunteer staff people, and I'll probably scale up
to 20 or 25. It's so easy to get people. This type of community
involvement is what drives Linux and the Linux kernel. Linus said,
&ldquo;Hey, I can't do everything on my own. Let's bring in other people
to do it.&rdquo; I am using this same model to build linux.com.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Tell me about the
site.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Trae</b></span>: linux.com is going to
have a broad scope. It is going to be <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span>
quintessential Linux portal. When people hear about Linux, they
will first go to linux.com to look for information. The press will
also be able to get various tidbits of information they need. Phil
Hughes is on our advisory board&mdash;we can't go wrong!</p><p>On the home site, there is going to be a huge &ldquo;What is
Linux&rdquo; button. All around the button will be editorials,
interviews, various other content and links to different things. A
button bar at the left side will be totally configurable. People
will be able to add links to their favorite places to the button
bar. No one is doing that&mdash;others are just including everyone
else's news. To me, this takes away from the experience of actually
visiting other people's web sites.</p><p>The main feature is the &ldquo;What is Linux&rdquo; section that
includes three areas: corporate, new to Linux and new to computers.
When a visitor clicks on one of these areas, he will be walked
through a &ldquo;power point-esque&rdquo;-type presentation, as opposed to a
text FAQ. It's not going to be a full multimedia experience, but it
will be very clear and concise, and at any time, a jump can be made
to another path or presentation. The layout the staff is working on
is very graphically pleasing, and more is yet to come.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Other sites do this
same sort of thing. What exactly will make linux.com unique?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Trae</b></span>: We will have a chat
section off the main page where people will be able to get tech
support from the community. No one does that now. Everyone else
offers e-mail or other types of support. We'll have a &ldquo;Talk with
Linux Users&rdquo; button where it will be easy to find. With just a
click, they will be talking to other Linux users and finding
answers to their questions. The only reason I am running Linux
right now is because the Linux community is so open-armed and
willing to help. They spend hours on IRC&mdash;countless hours&mdash;helping
people like me. That's an invaluable resource.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Yes, it is. I'm
always amazed how many people seem to have the time to do that. So,
the chat space is why people will come to this site?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Trae</b></span>: People will come
because we are <span   class="emphasis"><em>linux.com</em></span>!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Oh, because of your
name!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Trae</b></span>: Yes, the name has
power, lure&mdash;it is the main reason all those other people wanted
this domain.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: When do you expect
linux.com to be up?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Trae</b></span>: May 18&mdash;the start date
for Red Hat's Linux Expo in North Carolina. I wanted to launch it
at a trade show, and Linux Expo seemed the right time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: I'll be at the Expo
this year, so I'll see you for the announcement. Any comments about
linux.org?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Trae</b></span>: My hope is that when
we bring out this truly awesome site, linux.org will say &ldquo;Okay,
that's great! Let's one-up them.&rdquo; Then we'll say &ldquo;Oh, wait a
minute&mdash;let's one-up what they've done!&rdquo; Guess who wins this game
of &ldquo;one-up-manship&rdquo;? The users!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: That is certainly a
great attitude. Any closing thoughts?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Trae</b></span>: As long as the Linux
community wins, there will be no fracturing. We will never have
hard feelings towards any site. I want to see Linux win. I'd also
like to thank the staff and the rest of the Linux community who
helped get us here.</p></div></div>
