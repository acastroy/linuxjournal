Linux kernel. Whether from your favorite distribution or downloaded
from the Web, this will seem like a small transition compared to
what's coming. As I write, I am testing the new Caldera OpenLinux
2.2 beta. This distribution comes with not only a new kernel, but a
new glibc as well&mdash;yes, a new system library. By publication time,
I'm sure other distributions will be offering glibc-2.1, and I'll
have heard much wailing and gnashing of teeth.
</p><p>Several distributions, including Red Hat and Debian, have
already included glibc distributions, based on glibc-2.0.7. As I
remember, the glibc-2.0.x libraries were marked &ldquo;experimental&rdquo;,
so if you experimented, oh well. You say Red Hat didn't mention the
glibc library included in 5<span   class="emphasis"><em>.x</em></span> was
experimental? I guess we all need to pay closer attention to those
small details.</p><p>The new glibc-2.1 is different, and in some cases,
incompatible. After installing the beta, I attempted to build
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> with no luck. A function call
by needed ssh was missing. Also, my 128-bit encryption glibc
Netscape binary wouldn't start&mdash;I had to install the libc5 binary
of Netscape. These things should be fixed by the final release.
This month, I'm still building with glibc-2.0.7.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>nmap:</b></span> http://www.insecure.org/nmap/index.html</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>nmap</b></span> is a utility for
mapping your network and open ports on the network. It is a very
powerful, flexible, security auditing tool. While nmap has a number
of legitimate uses, many options are available to perform
&ldquo;stealthy&rdquo; probes of networks, something of questionable value.
This tool will almost certainly become a favorite of &ldquo;script
kiddies&rdquo; everywhere, so scanning your own network in advance to
learn what they'll find will save you some headaches. At least, it
will if you use the information to close/monitor any open holes
that were found. Several of nmap's options appear to be aimed at
not triggering monitoring tools like
<span   class="bold"><b>courtney</b></span> to report attacks. As a
network and systems administrator, I consider probes of my systems
and networks to be overtly hostile acts. At best, they will gain
you a message to your zone technical contact; at worst, an entry in
the hosts.deny file, sendmail access.db reject list and an ipchains
drop packet entry. I know I'm not alone. Required libraries are
libnsl and glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Nessus:</b></span> http://www.nessus.org/</p><p>Nessus is a highly configurable and very powerful security
auditing tool. Like nmap, it will probe your network, looking for
holes. Unlike nmap, Nessus requires a graphical interface, but
provides a slightly more user-friendly report. You'll need to
supply a bit more information to start it up, as it works in a
server/client configuration. Nessus is also less subject to being
&ldquo;hijacked&rdquo; by non-privileged users. If nmap is on your system in
an accessible place, anyone can run it. Since the Nessus client
must connect to a Nessus server and the server is password
protected, ordinary users cannot make use of it as easily. You can
make it even more secure by not leaving the server running.
Required libraries are libX11, libXext, libXi, glibc, libdl,
libgdk, libglib, libgmp2, libgtk, libm, libnsl and
libresolv.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Saint:</b></span> http://www.wwdsi.com/saint/</p><p>Saint is the reincarnation of SATAN. This particular tool
will be comfortable to those who have used SATAN, but the license
agreement bears reading. Based on the wording, I'd say their
definition of &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; is significantly different from most
definitions. The agreement appears to be more anti-litigation than
restrictive of the use of the software. Still, it is a good tool.
It requires the Perl 5 library and a web browser.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>nettest:</b></span> http://zorro.pangea.ca/~renec/nettest.php3</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>nettest</b></span> is a fairly simple
and extremely useful Perl script that will monitor any number of
hosts for connectivity. It won't watch individual processes, but it
will ping the host at designated intervals. If it notices a
particular host has stopped responding (for whatever reason), it
will take some action. That action may be no more than logging the
event in syslog or e-mailing one or more addresses. If you know
Perl, you can make it do even more.
<span   class="bold"><b>nettest</b></span> can also be configured to
take the same action when connectivity is restored. It requires the
Perl library.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xfreecell:</b></span> http://www2.giganet.net/~nakayama/</p><p>Freecell has been one of my favorite games for as long as I
can remember. The addicting part of this game is that you know it's
theoretically possible to win every game; however, I've yet to see
anyone do it. While my average stays fairly high, occasionally I
outsmart myself and just can't win&mdash;that doesn't stop me from
trying. Fast animations give hours of fun. Required libraries are
Xext, X11, stdc++, libm and glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted:</b></span> http://www.nllgg.nl/Ted/</p><p>Finally&mdash;a text editor that uses RTF (Rich Text Format) as
its default format. This editor is a nice, very simple text
processor. It will read ASCII text and RTF formatted files and
write RTF, ASCII and HTML. I didn't test the HTML feature. I was
mainly interested in the fact that it handles RTF, the one format
any true word processor will understand. Spelling modules are
available for Ted in English (American and British), Dutch, German,
French, Spanish and Portuguese. Required libraries are glibc,
libtiff, libjpeg, libpng and libgif.</p></div></div>
