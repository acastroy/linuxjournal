last year's WordPerfect 7 port to Linux, and so, appropriately,
this review is merely a follow-up to my review of WP7 (&ldquo;Word
Perfect 7 for Linux&rdquo;, April 1998).
</p><p>To summarize that review, I'd found WordPerfect 7 to be a
very good port of a solid product. It had all the features I
needed, plus many features I didn't, which are necessary for
buzzword compliance. It fit handily into what was then a very
low-end machine: a Pentium 120 laptop with 16MB of memory and 1GB
of disk space, only 600MB of which were allotted to Linux.</p><p>My problems with it at the time were few. It was a bit on the
slow side, particularly under Xfree86; I found I had to turn off
many of the dynamic features, like Spell-as-you-go and the
application bar at the bottom of the window. Under AcceleratedX,
performance was a bit better, but I still had to turn off the
dynamic spell-checking to get good speed. I also found the style
system overly complicated, and some crashes in the help system and
the HTML conversion code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f0a580.0x2002ad8"></a>Small Steps</h2></div></div><p>How does this next version stack up? Is it worth the download
time or the $50US for the shrink-wrapped version? I'd like to be
able to say, &ldquo;Yes, definitely!&rdquo; Instead, I find myself thinking,
&ldquo;It depends.&rdquo;</p><p>If you're already perfectly happy with WordPerfect 7, in that
you're not experiencing any problems and not missing any particular
feature, you may simply not <span   class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> this upgrade.
I know that's a bit heretical in the modern software industry, but
it's true. Most of the features already in place have had only
minor improvements.</p><p>Some nice new features are present for novices, including an
extensive guide system called &ldquo;PerfectExpert&rdquo;. Grammar-as-you-go
is new and useful if you like grammar checkers (I actually
do).</p><p>The speed is certainly improved. When I was first given
access to early betas, I still had the same low-end configuration
and found that not only could I leave Spell-as-you-go on, but I
could also leave the new Grammar-as-you-go active. The newer
version keeps up just fine with my typing. The final release seems
to be equally snappy, which made me very happy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f0a580.0x2002d40"></a>Getting What You Pay For</h2></div></div><p>Several features are available only in the purchased version,
not in the download. Notably, the ExpressDocs template feature is
not available in the download. The number of fonts available is
extremely limited. The &ldquo;Insert-&gt;Shape&rdquo; menu works, but,
&ldquo;Insert-&gt;Graphics-&gt;Draw A Picture&rdquo; does not; so you can
insert shapes &ldquo;in-line&rdquo;, but not a complete picture unless you
draw it with a different program. Also, the ability to create and
insert charts and graphs is disabled.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f0a580.0x2002e48"></a>Lingering Problems</h2></div></div><p>One of my biggest complaints from WordPerfect 7 remains a
complaint with its successor; indeed, it appears that no work
whatsoever has been done to improve it. The style-sheet system is
still incredibly complex&mdash;almost too complex to be useful. It is
difficult to define styles that are part of a library of styles
rather than part of a specific document, and defining individual
styles is a cryptic process.</p><p>The interaction of printers and fonts is also a bit strange.
In most word processors, the list of fonts available does not
reflect the printer selection; instead, fonts are translated or
substituted at the print-driver level. In WordPerfect, the list of
available fonts is a direct reflection of the way the currently
selected printer is set up, and setting up a printer is a
less-than-obvious process. This is as much a flaw in UNIX, which
has no nice, neat, centralized print model, as it is in
WordPerfect.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f0a580.0x2002fa8"></a>To Buy or Not to Buy</h2></div></div><p>If you need or want a good commercial word processor for
Linux, WordPerfect 8 is definitely a good value. It works, and it
works well. It's also inexpensive, which is always good.</p><p>If you already have WordPerfect 7 and are satisfied with it,
there's probably no great rush to upgrade. On the other hand, the
upgrade won't break the bank, either. Actually purchasing the
product will give you a wider range of fonts and access to all the
features, as well as save you considerable download time.</p><p>As much as I was hoping for more out of this upgrade, I'm
still very happy with the product and recommend it. I hope Corel
continues to have success with it.</p></div></div>
