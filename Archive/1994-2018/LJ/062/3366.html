    Every vendor wanted to be your only
    vendor&mdash;never mind that no vendor could provide anything close to all the services you
    needed.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2852580.0x294a1e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Before the Internet, networks were
private affairs. You bought them from Novell or Microsoft or IBM.
More accurately, you bought a set of network services you could
obtain only from certain companies. You got
<span   class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>print</em></span> from
Novell or Microsoft, <span   class="emphasis"><em>messaging</em></span> from Lotus,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>security</em></span> from IBM and so on. None of those
services would cooperate with those same services from other
companies. That's not how &ldquo;The System&rdquo; worked. Every vendor
wanted to be your only vendor&mdash;never mind that no vendor could
provide anything close to all the services you needed.
</p><p>The Internet broke that system by taking several network
services and putting their protocols (i.e., HTTP for Web, SMTP for
messaging, FTP for file transport and others) in the public domain,
running on top of the equally public network protocols of TCP/IP.
This gave us a high degree of interoperability for the first time.
The Internet still does not perform many services at all, or
performs them incompletely, so it did not put Novell and Microsoft
out of business. The &ldquo;Old Guys&rdquo; still perform very well, but the
Internet gave their businesses a whole new context&mdash;a public one.
In a blink, their whole world changed, along with everyone
else's.</p><p>It's still changing. When the Internet finishes settling in,
almost everything in communications will depend on it, from
embedded controllers to Palm Pilots to the entire phone system. But
perhaps the Internet was just the sound of one shoe dropping&mdash;and
the other shoe is Linux.</p><p>Linux seems to have the same calling: something free for
everybody. The Internet seems to be its natural companion. Already
the vast majority of web pages are served by Apache, running mostly
on Linux systems. Are web services an enterprise beachhead for
Linux? Or are they just a vertical application with little
leverage?</p><p>Is there a big-time business model for any Linux vendor,
besides attracting expensive investment bets from Microsoft OEMs
and partners looking for alternatives? Are there other
possibilities, all as radical and sensible as Linux itself?</p><p>How hard is it to imagine Linux kernels as the most basic
building blocks of networked life? For Linux geeks, it goes without
saying. For the rest of us it's a big stretch, especially when
Linux still looks like a Swiss watch delivered in 400 separate
parts. But so was imagining a networked world that wasn't a
medieval mess of warring states dominated by the Empire of
Microsoft, the Duchy of Novell and the Blue Kingdom of IBM.</p><p>We're still less than halfway through the shift from personal
to social computing. Most households do not have PCs, and most that
do are not connected to the Net. According to design critic and
user advocate Don Norman, the two basic reasons for this are:
computers are too complicated for many people, and the Net still
lacks a plug-and-run infrastructure. He lays out a short-form
prognosis in the title of his latest book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Invisible
Computer: Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So
Complex, and Information Appliances Are the
Solution.</em></span></p><p>People are social. Telephony is equally social, because it
lets people converse over simple appliances (incomprehensible cell
phones and PBXes notwithstanding). Computing is social too, but
only for a minority. There is still no computing appliance that's
as social as the telephone. Will Linux deliver it?</p><p>I suggest that the first social computing appliance&mdash;let's
call it the first SC&mdash;will cost less than $400, look friendlier
than an iMac, get on the Internet with the ease of a phone call,
and produce Microsoft Office-compatible files for those who want to
use simple productivity applications.</p><p>Well, a <span   class="emphasis"><em>prototype</em></span> of that appliance can
be built right now by slapping just about any Linux, any desktop
and any office suite onto a commodity PC too slow for Windows 98,
and a Windows newbie will probably know how to use it.</p><p>On the server side, the appliances are already here. The
Cobalt Qube 2 is a seven-inch blue cube that anyone with an IP
address can put on the Web in minutes and control easily over a
browser. It runs Apache on Linux, but Cobalt doesn't mention that
fact anywhere other than its data sheets. Why? Because it's an
<span   class="emphasis"><em>appliance</em></span>. What's in it matters no more than
what makes heat in a steam iron. All that matters is that it
works.</p><p>Right now, the companies moving in the appliance direction
are what economists call &ldquo;fast followers.&rdquo; Microsoft was once a
fast follower of Apple, which is why Windows is a MacOS knockoff.
Now Corel, KDE, Star Division and GNOME are fast followers of
Microsoft, which is why their goods are not only effective clones,
but in some cases (most notably Corel's) significantly improve on
what they copy. Are they headed in the right direction? Not if they
don't follow the user even more obsessively than they follow
Microsoft. Don Norman says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The successful family of information appliances
will be built around the people who use them and the tasks to be
performed. Products in the world of information technology have
suffered far too long under the existing technology-centered
designs... Today it is the individual who must conform to the needs
of technology. It is time to make technology conform to the needs
of people.</p></blockquote></div><p>Currently, Linux requires far more compliance than Windows or
Macintosh. Can that change? Only if some folks in the Linux
community start to remember &ldquo;the rest of us&rdquo; abandoned by Apple
fifteen years ago. If they do, the other shoe is sure to drop&mdash;big
time.
