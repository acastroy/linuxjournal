    In countries where the main competition is a cheap illegal
    copy, transparency and customizability are the real reasons
    to choose Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x182b580.0x19236b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Open-source software is customizable,
expandable and available at low or no cost. Closed-source software
is difficult to customize or expand and often is exorbitantly
expensive. As a result, businesses and governments worldwide are
beginning to make extensive use of open-source technologies, in
some cases going as far as introducing legislation to mandate its
use. You'd expect developing nations to be leading this charge for
free, high-quality software, but you'd be wrong.
</p><p>In Geekcorps' experience supporting over a hundred IT
projects in developing nations, open source is a surprisingly
difficult sell. The chief mistake in marketing to the developing
world is an overemphasis on &ldquo;free beer&rdquo;. The expression comes
from Richard Stallman's demand that software be &ldquo;free as in 'free
speech', not free as in 'free beer&rdquo;'. Emphasizing the low cost of
open-source software often backfires. The history of technology
transfer and appropriate technology projects includes efforts that
dumped obsolete technology on developing nations when it was no
longer marketable in developed nations. As a result, inexpensive
and inferior are often falsely equated.</p><p>In fact, free software frequently costs users in developing
nations more than proprietary software. Widespread copyright
infringement means software often is available for the price of the
media on which it's delivered. In Yerevan, Armenia, I recently
found Microsoft Windows XP and Red Hat 8 shelved side by side, both
selling for less than $5 US. For users familiar with Windows, Linux
has an incremental cost&mdash;the cost of the manuals necessary to use
the software. And, at copyright infringement prices, manuals can
cost 20 times as much as software.</p><p>Although on-line documentation can address some of these
problems, it can be expensive and intimidating to access this
information. Downloading the 3MB Emacs manual gets expensive when
you're paying by the minute for connectivity at a cyber caf&eacute;
where 20 machines share a single 28.8kbps modem. Asking questions
of experts in another country, often in an unfamiliar language,
becomes even more intimidating when new users encounter netiquette
for the first time. A well-meaning response of &ldquo;RTFM&rdquo; is likely
to be misinterpreted by someone from a culture that places a high
value on politeness or formality. Almost every culture in the world
is more polite than global geek culture.</p><p>Although open-source advocates need to consider the
linguistic, cultural and bandwidth barriers that affect adoption in
developing nations, our chief focus must be on demonstrating that
open-source software can be more advanced and powerful than the
alternatives. This requires a focus on the free speech benefits of
open source: expandability, transparency and resulting high
performance. A great example of &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; application
development is the translate.org.za project, dedicated to providing
operating systems and critical applications in all 11 of South
Africa's official languages. Thanks to their work&mdash;and the
availability of source code for Mozilla&mdash;a browser now exists in
Zulu, Xhosa and four other languages.</p><p>IDN, one of Ghana's leading ISPs
(<a href="http://www.idngh.com" target="_self">www.idngh.com</a>), is
refocusing its business around its SAVA wireless access points.
Manufactured in Ghana, SAVA boxes are Linux servers that let
businesses and cyber caf&eacute;s offer connectivity using WiFi,
avoiding Ghana's inadequate local phone system. ISPs around the
continent are looking at IDN's success, and some are migrating
their architectures to Linux servers.</p><p>Before open source can have a true worldwide audience,
developers need to focus on IT problems specific to developing
nations. Efforts such as Simputer
(<a href="http://www.simputer.org" target="_self">www.simputer.org</a>)--a
low-cost Linux-based handheld for India&mdash;suggest one model for
these efforts: a cadre of talented engineers from a developing
nation supported by a global community. MIT Media Lab's ThinkCycle
Project
(<a href="http://www.thinkcycle.org" target="_self">www.thinkcycle.org</a>)
demonstrates another model, matching design students in
universities around the world with the engineering challenges of
nonprofit organizations in developing nations. The US government's
new Digital Freedom Initiative
(<a href="http://www.digitalfreedom.gov" target="_self">www.digitalfreedom.gov</a>)
is trying a third model, creating solution teams of Senegalese
developers, business and IT expert volunteers from US and
Senegalese end users, to create new IT applications for use in
Senegal and throughout Africa.</p><p>Political developments also may advance the global adoption
of open source. An increasing number of politicians, like Peru's
Edgar Villanueva Nu&ntilde;ez, are pushing legislation to mandate
the use of free software to protect the &ldquo;integrity,
confidentiality and accessibility&rdquo; of information.</p><p>Advocates in the developed world can push in a different
direction. Demand that money spent by your nation's foreign aid
agency on development of new IT products in developing nations goes
toward the creation of open code. The result likely would be a boom
of developers in poor nations and a wealth of code that could be
used in other developing nations&mdash;not to mention a few more
Xhosa-speaking geeks.</p></div></div>
