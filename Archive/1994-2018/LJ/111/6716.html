all-in-one firewall product. Billed as an affordable
enterprise-level security solution, Astaro delivers an impressive
array of security features in one package. ASL V4 is a software
product, not an appliance, so you need to provide your own hardware
for it.
</p><p>The ASL feature set leaves little to be desired. It uses the
journaling features of the ext3 filesystem for rapid recovery from
unplanned reboots. All administration is performed from an SSL web
front end. It also comes with an SSH server that provides
command-line access, a fact that pleases this reviewer. Astaro does
state that SSH access is intended only for advanced users, because
users would have to edit the configuration files by hand. Still, I
was pleased to have the option of getting down and dirty with the
system if necessary.</p><p>ASL performs packet filtering, just as you'd expect a Linux-
and iptables-based system would. Source NAT, destination NAT and IP
masquerade are all supported. The default ruleset is quite locked
down and is modified automatically when you add or modify services.
But ASL adds further value with its use of network groups. ASL has
a single set of user interfaces to let you define networks, network
group, service groups and user objects. Once defined, ASL lets you
use them for all sorts of access control lists (ACLs). For example,
once a network group is defined, it can be used when configuring
NTP services and defining IP-masquerading rules. Another example
can be seen with the predefined service group called netbios,
defined as netbios-dgm (port 138), netbios-ns (port 137) and
netbios-ssn (port 139). With this group, one can set various rules
that consistently affect all three of these services.</p><p>As with packet filtering, ASL comes with the various proxy
packages we expect. This includes an HTTP cache that can be
configured to work transparently to the client, SOCKS proxy and
SMTP relay. The SMTP relay includes antispam and virus scanning
subsystems. ASL V4 also includes IPSec, DHCP, PPTP, identd, POP3
with virus scanner and DNS forwarding services. Service includes a
virus scanning subsystem.</p><p>For all the proxies and services that can make use of user
accounts, such as SOCKS, HTTP and SMTP, ASL can use your existing
LDAP, RADIUS or Windows Domains to provide authentication, or it
can use its own user account database. Once identity has been
established, access controls can be placed on users to control
access to different services.</p><p>ASL has a port-scan detection system that sends e-mail to an
administrator when it detects port-scan activity. It also can be
configured to drop or reject the port-scan traffic. Interestingly,
the source of the port-scan traffic is allowed to communicate again
after the port-scan traffic has ceased.</p><p>Astaro has incorporated an automatic update function into
ASL, called Up2Date. (It isn't clear what relation, if any, this
software has with Red Hat's up2date update tool.) All patches are
signed digitally, and all communications are encrypted. Besides
patches, virus and spam signatures also are updated with this
mechanism. Updates can be made manually&mdash;scheduled hourly, daily or
weekly&mdash;or can be downloaded by hand from Astaro's FTP server.
System configuration backups can be exported either manually or
automatically. These backups can be encrypted and e-mailed.</p><p>ASL offers load balancing, using iptables NAT rules to split
incoming connections between two or more actual servers. ASL seems
to be protocol-agnostic; that is, it performs load balancing for
any service protocol. Naturally, it remains for system
administrators to ensure that the servers sharing the load are able
to synchronize themselves if necessary.</p><p>Even the user guide has value beyond explaining how to use
ASL. It provides a short but accurate tutorial of the various
technologies involved in network security. For example, it
discusses transparent vs. application proxies, and it contrasts
them to IP masquerading.</p><p>ASL really has too many features to discuss fully in this
review, including syslog support, wireless LAN access point mode,
WEP support, the capability to plug in to an untagged port of a
VLANed switch (why this can be beneficial could be the subject of a
whole other article), a network time protocol client, high
availability and quality of service.</p><p>You can configure the system logs for authorization,
d&aelig;mons, kernel, notifications and SMTP relay messages to be
logged independently.</p><p>Astaro recommends a minimum system configuration of a single
Intel Pentium II (or equivalent) processor, 128MB of RAM, an 8GB
disk drive (ASL supports IDE and many popular SCSI cards) and two
or more PCI network cards. If you wish to use wireless network
PCMCIA cards, you should use one based on the Prism2 chipset.
Certain other configurations, such as high availability or the VLAN
subsystems, may require other specialized hardware.</p><p>The installation happens with a text/curses-based menu and is
fairly quick and simple. It asks a few questions and then proceeds
to repartition and reformat the hard drive, so be sure you're ready
to let that happen.</p><p>

</p><p>Once installed, you point a web browser at a secure web GUI.
The best adjective to describe the look of ASL's web GUI is slick;
it is well designed and has some impressive functions. One function
allows you to kick off other administrators, with the option of
providing them a reason for the boot. Logged-in sessions have an
automatic timeout as well. There's easy access to the system's
uptime, last login, date and time.</p><p>ASL has a nice iptables/firewall display, with GUI interfaces
to add your own rules, and easy-to-understand ICMP settings,
including options to make firewall visible to traceroute, make
firewall forward traceroute, make firewall ping visible and make
firewall forward pings and so on. This reviewer was most impressed
with the live log of filtered packets, whose regularly updating
display shows recent network activity. The only thing this display
lacks is some way to know which firewall rule caused a packet to be
denied. Such information is essential for rule debugging.</p><p>ASL's slickness extends to the SMTP GUI and its options for
access control and many ways to try to fight spam, such as verify
address, black holes, file type filter and expression filter. If
you've ever tried to configure sendmail, you know what a daunting
task this can be.</p><p>Besides configuration, the web GUI also contains a number of
graphs. The graphs plot statistics for CPU, RAM and swap; current
hard-disk usage and process list; total network connections; and
each network interface for the past 24 hours.</p><p>ASL has a few other remarkable features. The first is the
IPSec interface has a certificate management option. It can
generate or upload its own Certificate Authority (CA), and it can
receive and even fulfill requests for new client certificates. If
your organization does not have a certificate authority, ASL can
provide its own CA key material. Remember, a whole slew of policies
and procedures should be defined before one could consider one's CA
actually to be secure.</p><p>An ASL machine beeps five times at boot and shutdown, letting
you know its status with certainty. Most of the system services run
in a chroot()ed environment. Some even have their own disk
partition, which helps to prevent disruption of other services that
might otherwise result from a denial-of-service attack on one
service. The administrator can install custom software. ASL could
be a nice starting point for your own Linux-based projects.</p><p>ASL is not a typical home-use broadband firewall-router. It
certainly can be used for that, but because ASL can do so much more
than DHCP and IP masquerading (or NAT, if you prefer), typical home
use would be a waste of its features. Out of the box it requires
some setup, but if you already know you need more than a typical
broadband firewall-router appliance, chances are you already know
how to achieve this. ASL would make a good home-use firewall-router
for the network-savvy power user, someone comfortable with or
interested in learning the ins and outs of SMTP configuration, SSH
keys, RADIUS configuration and/or IPSec. So it's fortuitous that
Astaro provides a free home-use license, which does not include the
antivirus protection.</p><p>I do have a few minor reservations about ASL V4. I admit that
ASL impressed me with the sheer number of features it supports. It
is common security policy to limit the functional responsibilities
of each infrastructure node on your network. For instance, a router
should stick to routing, a firewall should stick to packet
filtering, a proxy server should stick to application protocol
proxies and an SMTP relay should stick to e-mail. The justification
is that a separation of functions limits the overall damage should
any one service suffer a security exploit. With everything in one
box, ASL might encourage an all-in-one approach. On the other hand,
such a configuration may be desired if there are cost, space or
administration constraints or, simply, if the risks aren't as high.
Indeed, there's no reason one couldn't install ASL on numerous
machines and turn on only certain services in each node. But this
illustrates another potential problem. Aside from the ability to
export and import configurations, there is no apparent support for
a single point of administration for multiple ASL nodes. In other
words, there's no policy manager that can push configurations to
multiple ASLs.</p><p>At installation time, you receive a 30-day license, after
which you need to purchase a full license. At the time of this
writing, prices range from $390 US for a ten-IP network and a
one-year Up2Date subscription to $6,895 US for unlimited IPs with
three years of Up2Date. Virus protection, high availability and
surf protection are priced separately. Astaro has a free personal
use license, and this reviewer intends to take advantage of
it.</p><p><a href="6716s1.html" target="_self">Product Information</a></p></div></div>
