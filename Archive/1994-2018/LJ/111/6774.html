FreePCB, which I intend to publish on the Internet as an
open-source project. I chose to write it for Microsoft Windows, and
if it is successful I would like to port it to Linux. When it comes
time to port it to Linux, how would you suggest that I
proceed?</p><p>&mdash;Allan Wright</p><p>One way to do a cross-platform application is with wxWindows

I would like to recommend that sales departments take a close look
at how they handle customer relations. Mandrake Linux refuses even
to post an e-mail address for pre-sales questions. I have attempted
to contact these people with detailed questions about product
component level support, prior to purchase, without success. Red
Hat refuses to respond to the individual user for pre-sales
inquiries. Heck, I have even tried to get information out of them
for my place of employment, an enterprise-level situation. SuSE&mdash;my
hat is off to these guys. You may not get the perfect response, but
they do acknowledge you exist and try to help. I have a copy of 7.3
Pro and am most likely to purchase another version once I get a
home wireless network. Debian&mdash;again, my hat is off, and they don't
even sell anything. I have had many responses to inquiries from
their support base. Thanks to SuSE and Debian. Please keep up the
good work.</p><p>&mdash;John R. Klaus</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5c580.0x20544a8"></a>alt.fan.robert-love</h2></div></div><p>I want to thank you for getting Robert Love to write the
article on kernel 2.6. The article was simply superb and explained
many facts about what happens during the kernel development
process.</p><p>&mdash;Ravi</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5c580.0x2054608"></a><span   class="emphasis"><em>Vive le Chef</em></span>!</h2></div></div><p>I give credit to Mr Gagn&eacute; for my first purchase of
<i  >LJ</i>. When teaching at a local college, I
directed my students to articles of his that were relevant to
topics covered. I joined his site mailing list and purchased his
book because of his style of writing. Your web site has given me
the opportunity to publish articles I have written, and I will
admit my writing style tends to mirror Mr Gagn&eacute;'s. I find a
lighter writing style mixed with a human element has character.
Computer concepts can be brought to life. It is our responsibility
as authors to make it happen. I have strong memories of teachers
and writers who moved off the mainstream path to deliver their
message. You are doing something right when you offer Marcel
Gagn&eacute;'s articles to your readers.</p><p>&mdash;Sean D. Conway</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5c580.0x2054818"></a>Spam Kills</h2></div></div><p>Twenty billion junk e-mail messages sent per day may
potentially take 20 billion seconds to delete. A human life is a
mere two billion seconds long. In effect, spammers kill ten people
each day. If <i  >Linux Journal</i> financially
supports a business that offers web hosting services to spammers,
then <i  >Linux Journal</i> in effect backs spamming.
It would be more appropriate for <i  >Linux Journal</i>
to question the allegations that Rackspace harbors spammers, than
to question the need of the Internet community to take meaningful
action against network abuse.</p><p>&mdash;Anders Andersson, Uppsala University</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5c580.0x2054a80"></a>Shirt Sandbags Linux at Church</h2></div></div><p><i  >Linux Journal</i>'s silly &ldquo;Linux Saves&rdquo;
T-shirt really undermines my effort to recommend the use of Linux
in the United Methodist Church. I feel that churches would greatly
benefit from Linux and other open-source software, and I don't
understand why someone would create a product like this. Maybe they
thought it would be funny outside the church, but inside, nobody is
laughing.</p><p>&mdash;Mark Ramsell</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5c580.0x2054c38"></a>Wine Recommendation</h2></div></div><p>Please, please keep Marcel and his trusted assistant,
Fran&ccedil;ois exactly as they are! Not only does it help the
Francophiles among us to brush up on our French, but the levity it
provides actually aids the cognitive process, at least in this
reader's humble opinion. Marcel, when are you going to feature a
fine Virginia wine?</p><p>&mdash;Pat Murphy</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5c580.0x2054d98"></a>Red-Eye No More</h2></div></div><p>I fixed one of my digital images after reading Eric Jeschke's

Yay Kernel, Boo Pixelated Games
</p></div></div><p>I just got my <i  >Linux Journal</i> (May 2003)
in the mail the other day, and many pressing things were put aside
while I read it. The article on the 2.6 kernel typifies what I like
about your magazine. Heather Mead's column, &ldquo;Adaptability and
Ingenuity&rdquo; left me a bit confused. Am I the only one who doesn't
know what a theremin is? The Upfront section now and again features
programs so old-school they make me cringe; your review and picture
of Football Manager is a prime example. The graphics are nothing if
not from Atari 2600. These sorts of crufty-looking programs just
don't cut it.</p><p>&mdash;Matt Wyczalkowski</p><p>The theremin was the first electronic instrument, invented by
Leon Theremin in the 1920s and still played today. And, some of the
oldest-looking games have the best play value&mdash;Ed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5c580.0x20553c8"></a>Another Linux License Plate</h2></div></div><p>Here is another license plate for you. &ldquo;LINUX&rdquo; was already

articles written by Marcel Gagn&eacute;. On seeing a negative
comment about the French chef's approach in the May 2003 Letters

much.</p><p>&mdash;Glen Farmer</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5c580.0x2055790"></a>Erratum</h2></div></div><p>On page 12 of the April 2003 issue, the quotation by Craig
