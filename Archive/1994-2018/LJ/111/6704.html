    Modifying an Xbox can increase your PC hardware knowledge
    and provide you with a useful little system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ced580.0x1de54a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In November 2001, Microsoft entered the
video console business with the Xbox, a machine that continues to
outperform all other consoles in terms of processor speed and video
performance. As with the SEGA Dreamcast, hackers started to port
Linux to the Xbox in May 2002. Only three months later, the first
kernel messages from an Xbox running Linux were published on the
Internet. Now, a year after the start of the project, Linux runs
reliably on all versions of the Xbox, and Xbox Linux is ready for
daily use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ced580.0x1de55b0"></a>Xbox Hardware</h2></div></div><p>The Xbox is driven by a 733MHz Intel Celeron processor and
contains 64MB of DDR RAM (shared with video), an NVIDIA GeForce3
graphics processing unit (GPU), an 8GB or 10GB hard disk, a DVD-ROM
drive, Ethernet connectivity, four USB-style controller connectors
and TV-out (Figure 1 lists the details). This hardware overview
sounds more like the description of a decent PC than a gaming
console. The Xbox does not merely contain some typical PC
components, such as an Intel CPU or an NVIDIA GPU, it actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a PC in a smaller black case, with minor
modifications. The Xbox chipset consists of the NV2A Northbridge
and the MCPX Southbridge, both from NVIDIA. The NVIDIA nForce
chipset for PCs is almost the same as the Xbox chipset. Its
Southbridge IC is labeled MCP and contains exactly the same
functionality as the MCPX: two USB controllers, an IDE controller,
an Ethernet device and AC97-compatible Dolby Digital sound.</p><p><a href="6704f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1. The Xbox hardware in a
tree view. The numbers on the right are the PCI locations and
IDs.</a></p><p>The background of the Xbox is simple. Because Microsoft
already had an operating system, system libraries and the DirectX
libraries for the PC, they decided to build the Xbox based on this
well-known architecture. Initially, Microsoft wanted AMD to produce
the CPU and the chipset for the Xbox; the video chip would come
from NVIDIA. But Microsoft later changed its mind, switching to
Intel for the CPU. So NVIDIA licensed the chipset from AMD,
manufactured the ICs for the Xbox and sold the same design as
nForce for the PC market.</p><p>The similarity of the Xbox to a PC not only made the process
of installing and running Linux a lot easier, it made a lot more
sense for people to use the Xbox as a computer. Unlike Dreamcast,
PlayStation 2 or the GameCube, the Xbox always is equipped with a
hard disk and Ethernet. And the PC hardware also makes it possible
to use standard Linux distributions on the Xbox, with minor
modifications.</p><p>Because of its price and its compactness, an Xbox running
Linux can be used as a desktop computer (see Figure 2) or a server,
replacing a standard PC, and because of its TV connectivity, it
also can be used as an entertainment device for watching video or
listening to audio.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6704f2.large.jpg"><img src="6704f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. A KDE Desktop at 640 &times; 480 on an

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ced580.0x1de5ad8"></a>Security</h2></div></div><p>Despite the similarity of the Xbox to a standard PC,
installing Linux on an Xbox is not simply a matter of inserting an
installation CD. For one thing, the Xbox boot process is a lot
different from a PC's. PCs have a PCBIOS (basic I/O system) in ROM,
which contains 16-bit library routines for keyboard, video and hard
disk I/O, as well as a simple bootloader that reads the first
sector from a storage device and runs it. The Xbox has no such
BIOS. Its 256KB ROM image contains a statically linked,
stripped-down, Windows 2000-based kernel, which runs the moment the
Xbox is turned on. The hard disk&mdash;which is locked by an individual
ATA password, so it cannot be read when connected to a computer or
replaced with another hard disk&mdash;does not contain any operating
system components. When the Xbox kernel is started, it unlocks the
hard disk and tries to run the default.xbe file from a CD or DVD.
If such a file cannot be found, it runs xboxdash.xbe from hard
disk. This is the system configuration and audio CD player
application permanently stored on the hard disk.</p><p>These .xbe files are executables, which are a lot like Linux
ELF files, except they are signed digitally with Microsoft's
2048-bit RSA key. Changing a single byte within the file makes the
signature invalid, and the file will be rejected by the Xbox
kernel. Because of the lack of Microsoft's private key, the Xbox
Linux Project cannot reproduce a valid signature; thus, we cannot
create executables accepted by a standard Xbox. Two approaches are
possible to get your own code running: replace the ROM or find a
game with a bug that can be exploited.</p><p>The standard way for most people to get Linux running on an
Xbox is to open the box and install a replacement ROM chip that
overrides the onboard ROM chip. This so-called modchip can contain
either a hacked version of Microsoft's ROM, which has the signature
test, the hard disk test and some other things disabled, or a
clean-room ROM implementation that gives the Xbox the personality
of a regular PC. Although Xbox Linux supplies a bootloader that
makes Linux run on hacked Microsoft ROMs (which Linux sites do not
supply, but can be found on the Internet), the use of the Xbox
Linux Project's clean-room implementation, called Cromwell, is
recommended for legal reasons. The Cromwell ROM does not run Xbox
games.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6704f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. The Xbox dissected: the Philips DVD drive
is on the left, and the Seagate hard disk is on the right. The
green board in the background is a modchip that is, in this case,
connected to a computer's parallel port.</p></div></div>
</p><p>Modchips that replace the onboard ROM are available from many
video game hardware stores on the Internet for about $50 US. The
first generation of modchips had to be soldered into the Xbox board
parallel to the original Flash chip, which required about 30 wires.
Second-generation modchips were connected to the LPC bus on the
Xbox board, and they typically required only nine wires. Current
modchips can be screwed onto the board without any soldering. They
usually ship empty and can turn themselves off completely, so if
you use the Xbox Linux Clean BIOS, you still can run Xbox
games.</p><p>Because the original ROM contents are stored in a
reprogrammable Flash chip on the Xbox board, it also is possible to
overwrite the Flash contents in order to have a permanently modded
machine, without installing any additional hardware devices. This
can be done by installing a modchip, bridging two pairs of points
on the board to disable the write protection of the Flash IC,
running Linux, disabling the modchip and, finally, running an
application called raincoat in Linux to reprogram the onboard
Flash. Now, the modchip can be removed permanently, so you can use
one modchip to convert a lot of Xboxes to Linux.</p><p>Recently, an anonymous researcher found an exploitable bug in
the Electronic Arts game <span   class="emphasis"><em>007 Agent Under Fire</em></span>.
In a post on an Xbox forum, he explained how to use a modified
saved game to run the Linux bootloader. By connecting the
write-protection bridges on the board, this method can be used to
reprogram the onboard Flash within a Linux instance that has been
started by this modified saved game, without even temporarily
installing a modchip. This is the cheapest and most simple way to
make an Xbox Linux-compatible.</p><p>All these methods apply only to Xbox consoles that have been
on the market to date. Microsoft keeps changing the Xbox design. By
the time you read this article, a new board layout of the Xbox
might have the LPC bus or the reprogrammability of the onboard
Flash removed. Refer to the Xbox Linux web site for the latest
information on this topic.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ced580.0x1de6058"></a>USB</h2></div></div><p>Having a modded Xbox with either a modified Microsoft BIOS or
the Xbox Linux BIOS means you can start the Linux installation&mdash;but
how do you interact with the installer? The Xbox does have USB
connectivity; all controllers, memory units and the Xbox Live
headset are standard USB 1.1 devices, but with different
connectors. By attaching an adapter, you can connect any USB
keyboard, mouse, webcam, printer or scanner that is supported by
the PC version of Linux. These adapters are sold on the Internet
for about $10-$15 US, but it also is possible to build your own
with little effort. All you need is an Xbox controller extension
cable, which has the connector to plug in to the Xbox on one side,
as well as a USB female connector. Both cables contain four wires
in different colors; simply cut both cables and reconnect the wires
to create a USB-female-to-Xbox-male adapter cable.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6704f4.large.jpg"><img src="6704f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. A USB adaptor cable can be built easily by
using an XBox controller extension cable and the USB female
connector on the right. You also can buy prebuilt cables like the
one on the left.</p></div></div>
</p><p>The slot for the memory unit on your controller is another
USB port, so you also can solder the USB female connector
there.</p><p>If you plan to buy a USB keyboard and mouse for the Xbox, try
to get a keyboard with a USB or PS/2 mouse connector built in. This
way, you need only one Xbox-to-USB adapter. Macintosh keyboards
have proven to work very well&mdash;and they don't have Windows keys,
either.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ced580.0x1de6420"></a>Distributions</h2></div></div><p>With a modded Xbox, a keyboard and a mouse, you now can
choose either to build Xbox Linux yourself or to take one of our
prebuilt installations. At the moment, Xbox Linux offers three main
distributions: Mandrake, Debian and the Xbox Linux Live System. The
latter is a version of Linux without X but with Trolltech's Qtopia.
It does not install into the hard disk, and it can be controlled
with an Xbox controller. It is supposed to give newbies an
impression of the possibilities available with Linux. Mandrake and
Debian are full distributions that install into the hard disk.
Mandrake 9.0 is available now, and 9.1 will be available soon. Both
are based on the PC versions of Mandrake Linux and are 100%
compatible with them and their RPM packages. They contain GNOME,
KDE and many popular applications. The Xbox version of Debian can
be booted into X from CD, but it also can be installed to hard
disk. Debian has smaller release cycles and is updated more often,
therefore it is used by most developers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ced580.0x1de6528"></a>Bootloader</h2></div></div><p>All those who don't want to use the prebuilt distributions
but want to do everything themselves, and those who want to know
how it works, should have a look at the Xbox Linux bootloaders, the
kernel and the XFree patches.</p><p>As pointed out earlier, Xbox Linux can be booted either
through the Xbox Linux Clean BIOS or from an unsigned .xbe file
that pretends to be a game and starts Linux on a modified Microsoft
BIOS. Both these applications are based on the same bootloader
code, which loads the kernel and initial RAM disk from CD/DVD or
hard disk, reserves 4MB of RAM for video and passes 60MB to the
Linux kernel. Details about the kernel and initrd filenames and
locations are read from the file linuxboot.cfg, which must reside
in the same directory as the .xbe file in the case of the Microsoft
BIOS. In the case of the Clean BIOS, the user can choose from where
to read it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ced580.0x1de6688"></a>Kernel Patches</h2></div></div><p>In order for a Linux kernel to work on the Xbox, only one
byte has to be changed&mdash;but for a perfectly adapted kernel, you
need more changes. The Xbox has a severe bug in its PCI chipset
that makes the machine crash when Linux tries to enumerate the PCI
devices at boot time. By narrowing the region of PCI device numbers
that are checked, this crash can be avoided. Another issue is the
timer frequency: the Xbox system timer is off by about 6%, making
music play too fast and making the kernel report the CPU clock
frequency incorrectly.</p><p>The shutdown and reboot sequence is handled differently on
the Xbox, but by adding some code to the kernel, it is able to
reset and shut down the machine properly. Because copy restrictions
often have been circumvented on other gaming consoles by inserting
a legitimate game first and quickly replacing it with a copy, the
Xbox, by default, reboots if you press the Eject button. Software
can avoid this by replying to a request sent by the PIC16L chip
that says not to reboot. Another patch in the kernel takes care of
this. Yet some other code patches the report of the DVD drive,
which pretends not to support video DVDs, although it does. On the
Xbox Linux site, you can download patches for some well-known
kernel versions that include all these modifications, plus support
for the Xbox hard disk partitioning scheme and the Xbox hard disk
filesystem (FATX). The modified files also are available in the
Xbox Linux CVS. You have to enable the option for Xbox support in
the kernel configuration.</p><p>Xbox Linux runs well in VESA framebuffer mode; that is, the
bootloader sets up a fixed graphics mode and Linux inherits it,
always writing into video memory but never accessing the actual
video hardware. Alternatively, a patched version of the rivafb
accelerated framebuffer driver is available, which allows changing
the console video mode at runtime. In any case, you have to enable
a framebuffer driver in the kernel configuration, because Xbox
Linux does not support text mode yet.</p><p>With a minimal patch for the ALSA sound system, again
available from the Xbox Linux CVS, the Xbox sound hardware can work
with the i810 driver. The binary-only network driver for the NVIDIA
nForce card, which you can download from the NVIDIA web site, works
on the Xbox without any modification. An SMBus driver is needed if
you want to enable the eject fix or to access the 256 bytes of
EEPROM on the motherboard. You can use either the i2c-xbox module
in the Xbox Linux CVS or the amd-756 module from the lm_sensors
project. Both work equally well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ced580.0x1de6898"></a>XFree86</h2></div></div><p>XFree runs out of the box if you use the framebuffer driver
and turn off PCI enumeration in the configuration file. A modified
version of the nvdrv driver provides video mode change at runtime
and 2-D acceleration (GLX extensions). Multimedia applications can
render their window into an off-screen buffer, and the video
hardware stitches it into the visible screen when displaying it,
scaling it in hardware. Precompiled versions of the driver are
available. nvdrv is the open-source driver for NVIDIA graphics
hardware, which does not support 3-D acceleration. Efforts are
underway to patch the binary-only, 3-D-aware XFree driver available
from NVIDIA.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ced580.0x1de69a0"></a>Optimizing Applications</h2></div></div><p>The Xbox hardware details are quite impressive, enough for
playing DVD or DivX video in Linux. But for optimal performance,
you should try to optimize the compilation of your applications for
the actual hardware. The machine's Celeron is a Pentium III class
CPU, and it supports the 686 instruction set, as well as MMX and
SSE. Applications, including mplayer, detect this automatically. If
you use the nvdrv XFree driver, you can enable GLX support for
video applications. mplayer, for instance, is fastest in X with the
nvdrv driver, even faster than it is in framebuffer mode. Also,
keep in mind that you should decrease the hardware resolution
instead of making the application scale the video output. In
640&times;480 mode, the PlayStation emulator epsx runs quite well
with the picture scaled to 400 &times; 300 pixels.</p><p>

Xbox-based Domino Server, running a clustered environment with
Domino on an IBM pSeries. The Xbox is the small system on the
left.</p></div></div>
</p><p>Although the Xbox is equipped with only 64MB of RAM&mdash;which
can be extended to 128MB with excellent soldering skills&mdash;desktop
environments, such as GNOME and KDE, and applications like
OpenOffice.org run quite well. With the help of VMware, you even
can use MS-DOS and Windows 95/98/NT/2000 on the Xbox. With a
minimal X window, no desktop environment and no window manager, you
can run Windows with up to 48MB of RAM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ced580.0x1ddd5a0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>With 1:1 ports of common Linux distributions for the PC and
all major Linux applications running on the Xbox, it is ready for
use on a desktop computer, a server or a multimedia device. With
its excellent hardware and PC compatibility, there is more than
simple hack value to it.</p><p><a href="6704s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
