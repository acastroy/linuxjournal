    You probably have search on your web site, but how about a
    search engine for the man pages on your system or even your
    mail? Try this simple indexing package.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fd580.0x28f5608"></a></h2></div></div><p>You might want to build custom indices of
documents for many reasons. A widely cited one is to supply search
functionality to a web site, but you also may want to index your
e-mail or technical documents. Anyone who has looked into
implementing such a functionality has probably found it's not as
easy as it might seem. Various factors conspire to make searching
difficult. </p><p>The venerable and indispensable grep and its ilk are
effective for scanning through lines of text. But grep, egrep and
their relations won't do everything for you. They won't search
across lines, they won't show search results in a ranked order and
their linear search algorithms don't lend themselves to searching
larger volumes of data.</p><p>HTML doesn't help the situation either. Its display-oriented
features, idiosyncratic grammar and bevy of formatting and entity
tags make it fairly difficult to parse correctly.</p><p>At the other end of the data storage spectrum is data slotted
into a database. The ubiquitous example is that of the SQL
database, which allows somewhat sophisticated search facilities but
usually is not particularly fast for searching. Some database
engines, notably MySQL 4, address this issue by allowing fast and
ranked searches, but they may not be as customizable as
desired.</p><p>In this article, we explore ways to create custom indices
using SWISH-E, Perl and XML on Linux. Through examples, we show how
SWISH-E can be used to build indices of HTML files, PDF files and
man pages.</p><p>SWISH-E (simple web indexing system for humans&mdash;enhanced) is
a descendant of SWISH, which was created in 1994 by Kevin Hughes.
SWISH was transferred in 1996 to the UC Berkeley Library to fix
bugs and add features, and the result was licensed under the GPL
and renamed SWISH-E. Development continues, spearheaded by current
project maintainer Bill Moseley and assisted by a team of
developers.</p><p>Here at SkateboardDirectory.com, we happened upon SWISH-E
when researching indexing toolkits. We found that it offers a
unique combination of features that make it attractive for our
purposes. Not only does SWISH-E offer a fast and robust toolkit
with which to build and query indices, but it is also well
documented, undergoes active development and bug fixes and includes
a Perl interface. We also liked that maintainer Moseley and other
experienced SWISH-E users and developers are usually prompt when
addressing questions and bugs brought up on the SWISH-E mailing
list.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fd580.0x28f5920"></a>Installing SWISH-E</h2></div></div><p>For our examples, we started with a stock Red Hat 7.3
workstation with the Software Development bundle of packages
installed. We also tested the examples on a Red Hat 6.2 workstation
and a Debian Woody.</p><p>Currently, installing SWISH-E on Red Hat means installing
from source, and the zlib and libxml2 libraries are required to
build SWISH-E fully. If you find you need to install either, you
probably can find packages provided with your distribution. We also
use the xpdf package in our examples, so you may want to install
that now if it isn't already. Our reference Red Hat 7.3 workstation
setup had all of SWISH-E's prerequisites installed.</p><p>Here, we describe the use of SWISH-E 2.4, which according to
the development team, should be released by the time you read this
article. You can fetch and set up SWISH-E with the following
sequence of commands, substituting the current version for
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>x.x</em></span>):</p><pre     class="programlisting">% wget \
  http://swish-e.org/Download/swish-e-x.x.tar.gz
% tar zxf swish-e-x.x.tar.gz
% cd swish-e-x.x
% ./configure
% make
% make test</pre><p>To install the SWISH-E binary, C libraries and man pages into
their default locations in /usr/local, type <b  >make
install</b> as root. This installs the SWISH-E executable
into /usr/local/bin. If this directory isn't in your PATH, either
change your appropriate dot file to include /usr/local/bin in your
PATH, or always call the swish-e executable by full pathname, like
/usr/local/bin/swish-e.</p><p>Now, let's build and install the SWISH::API Perl module from
the Perl directory in the source. We'll need it later when we build
a Perl client for our index of man pages. SWISH::API is set up by
the normal Perl module install process:</p><pre     class="programlisting">% cd perl
% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test</pre><p>Then, install the SWISH-E Perl module by typing <b  >make
install</b> as root.</p><p>Now that SWISH-E and the SWISH::API Perl module are installed
fully, let's build a simple index of HTML files to test SWISH-E.
For this example, we index the HTML, one-page-per-section versions
of the Linux Documentation Project (LDP) HOWTOs, which we've
unpacked into ~/HOWTO-htmls/. The tarballs of LDP documents used in
this article come from
<a href="http://www.tldp.org/docs.html" target="_self">www.tldp.org/docs.html</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fd580.0x28f5e48"></a>Indexing HTML on the Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>The first step in building an index with SWISH-E is writing a
configuration file. Create a directory like ~/indices,
<b  >cd</b> into it and create the file ./howto-html.conf
with the following contents:</p><pre     class="programlisting"># howto-html.conf
IndexDir  ../HOWTO-htmls/
IndexOnly .html
IndexFile ./howto-html.index</pre><p>The IndexDir directive specifies the directory in which
SWISH-E should look for files to be indexed. The IndexOnly
directive requests that only files ending in .html be indexed.
Finally, the location of the index to be created is specified with
the IndexFile directive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fd580.0x28f6058"></a>Our First Index</h2></div></div><p>Now, let's build our index of HTML files with the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">% swish-e -c howto-html.conf</pre><p>The -c option specifies which SWISH-E configuration file to
use. On an older system, building this index may take a few minutes
or so; on a contemporary one, it should take under a minute. Figure
1 illustrates the process of indexing HTML files on the filesystem
with SWISH-E.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6652f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Indexing HTML on the Filesystem with
SWISH-E</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fd580.0x28f63c8"></a>Searching the Index</h2></div></div><p>Let's test our first index by doing a simple search for HTML
files relevant to the term NFS. You can test SWISH-E indices
quickly using the swish-e executable by specifying an index with
the -f option, and the text to be searched with the -w option;
searches on SWISH-E indices are case-insensitive. Because we expect
a lot of pages (or hits) to include the word NFS, we use the -m 3
option to request only three:</p><pre     class="programlisting">% swish-e -f howto-html.index -m 3 -w nfs</pre><p>This returns (abridged and reformatted):</p><pre     class="programlisting">1000 ../HOWTO-htmls/NFS-HOWTO/performance.html
        "Optimizing NFS Performance" 33288
998 ../HOWTO-htmls/NFS-HOWTO/intro.html
       "Introduction" 10966
993 ../HOWTO-htmls/NFS-HOWTO/security.html
       "Security and NFS" 35968</pre><p>Not bad&mdash;those pages are definitely about NFS, and the output is
intuitive. The first column is the rank SWISH-E gives each hit&mdash;the
hits considered most relevant always are ranked 1000, with
less-relevant files ranked in descending order. The second column
shows the name of the file, the third gives the page's title and
the fourth shows the byte count of the indexed data. SWISH-E
determines the title of each page from the HTML tags in each file
using one of its HTML parsing engines.</p><p>The built-in SWISH-E parsing engines are called TXT, HTML and
XML, and each is designed to parse the corresponding type of
content. Recent versions of SWISH-E also can use the libxml2
library for the HTML2 and XML2 parsing back ends. Both the XML2 and
HTML2 parsers are preferable to their built-in
counterparts&mdash;especially HTML2. This is why a recent version of
libxml2, though technically optional when building SWISH-E,
probably should be considered a prerequisite.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fd580.0x28f6688"></a>Basic SWISH-E Search Syntax</h2></div></div><p>SWISH-E supports a full-featured text retrieval search
language with syntax including AND, OR, NOT and parenthetic
grouping that all work predictably. For example, the following
searches all have the expected semantics:</p><pre     class="programlisting">% swish-e -f howto-html.index -w nfs AND tcp
% swish-e -f howto-html.index -w nfs OR tcp
% swish-e -f howto-html.index \
        -w '(gandalf OR frodo) OR (lord AND rings)'</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fd580.0x28f67e8"></a>The Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>SWISH-E configuration files are simple text files in which
each line is either a directive or a comment. Any line in which the
first non-whitespace character is a # is ignored by SWISH-E as a
comment. All other non-empty lines should be in the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">Directive Options [Options] ...</pre><p>If you need to specify an option with spaces embedded, you
   can use quotation marks:</p><pre     class="programlisting">Directive "Option With Spaces!"</pre><p>If the option has single quotation marks within it, you can quote
it with the double quote character and vice versa, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">Directive "Fred's Index Option"
Directive 'By Josh "joshr" Rabinowitz'</pre><p>Dozens of directives can be applied to SWISH-E configuration files.
An exhaustive reference can be found in the SWISH-E documentation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fd580.0x28f6b00"></a>The Index</h2></div></div><p>Each SWISH-E index is stored in a pair of files. One is named
as specified in the IndexFile directive, and the other is called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>indexname</em></span>.prop. When talking about a SWISH-E
index, we mean this pair of files.</p><p>The indices can get large. In our example index of HTML
files, the index occupies about 11MB, about one-fourth the size of
the original files indexed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fd580.0x28f6cb8"></a>Indexing PDF Files</h2></div></div><p>Up to now, we've talked only about indexing HTML, XML and
text files. Here's a more-advanced example: indexing PDF documents
from the Linux Documentation Project.</p><p>For SWISH-E to index arbitrary files, PDF or otherwise, we
must convert the files to text, ideally resembling HTML or XML, and
arrange to have SWISH-E index the results.</p><p>We could index the PDF files by converting each to a
corresponding file on disk and then index those, but instead we'll
use this opportunity to introduce a more flexible way to index
data: SWISH-E's programmatic access method (Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6652f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Indexing Arbitrary Data with an External
Program and SWISH-E</p></div></div><p>To index the PDF files, start by creating a SWISH-E
configuration file, calling it howto-pdf.conf and endowing it with
the following contents:</p><pre     class="programlisting"># howto-pdf.conf
IndexDir      ./howto-pdf-prog.pl
               # prog file to hand us XML docs
IndexFile     ./howto-pdf.index
               # Index to create.
UseStemming   yes
MetaNames     swishtitle swishdocpath</pre><p>Here, the IndexDir directive specifies what SWISH-E calls an
external program that will return data about what is to be indexed,
instead of a directory containing all the files. The UseStemming
yes directive requests SWISH-E to stem words to their root forms
before indexing and searching. Without stemming, searching for the
word &ldquo;runs&rdquo; on a document containing the word &ldquo;running&rdquo; will
not match. With stemming, SWISH-E recognizes that &ldquo;runs&rdquo; and
&ldquo;running&rdquo; both have the same root, or stem word, and finds the
document relevant.</p><p>Last in our configuration file, but certainly not least, is
the MetaNames directive. This line adds a special ability to our
index&mdash;the ability to search on only the titles or filenames of the
files.</p><p>Now, let's write the external program to return information
about the PDF files we're indexing. Conveniently, the SWISH-E
source ships with an example module, pdf2xml.pm, which uses the
xpdf package to convert PDF to XML, prefixed with appropriate
headers for SWISH-E. We use this module, copied to ~/indices, in
our external program howto-pdf-prog.pl:</p><pre     class="programlisting">#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use pdf2xml;
my @files =
    `find ../HOWTO-pdfs/ -name '*.pdf' -print`;
for (@files) {
    chomp();
    my $xml_record_ref = pdf2xml($_);
    # this is one XML file with a SWISH-E header
    print $$xml_record_ref;
}</pre><p>Equipped with the SWISH-E configuration file and the external
   program above, let's build the index:</p><pre     class="programlisting">% swish-e -c howto-pdf.conf -S prog</pre><p>The -S prog option tells SWISH-E to consider the IndexDir specified
as a program that returns information about the data to be indexed.
If you forget to include -S prog when using an external program
with SWISH-E, you'll be indexing the external program itself, not
the documents it describes.</p><p>When the PDF index is built, we can perform searches:</p><pre     class="programlisting">% swish-e -f howto-pdf.index -m 2 -w boot disk</pre><p>We should get results similar to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">1000 ../HOWTO-pdfs/Bootdisk-HOWTO.pdf
      "Bootdisk-HOWTO.pdf" 127194
983 ../HOWTO-pdfs/Large-Disk-HOWTO.pdf
     "Large-Disk-HOWTO.pdf" 85280</pre><p>The MetaNames directive also lets us search on the titles and paths
   of the PDF files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">% swish-e -f howto-pdf.index -w swishtitle=apache
% swish-e -f howto-pdf.index -w swishdocpath=linux</pre><p>All corresponding combinations of searches are supported. For
   example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">% swish-e -f howto-pdf.index -w '(larry and wall)
    OR (swishdocpath=linux OR swishtitle=kernel)'</pre><p>The quoting above is necessary to protect the parentheses from
interpretation by the shell.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fd580.0x28edee8"></a>Indexing Man Pages</h2></div></div><p>For our final example, we show how to make a useful and
powerful index of man pages and how to use the SWISH::API Perl
module to write a searching client for the index. Again, first
write the configuration file:</p><pre     class="programlisting"># sman-index.conf
IndexFile ./sman.index
  # Index to create.
IndexDir  ./sman-index-prog.pl
IndexComments no
  # don't index text in comments
UseStemming yes
MetaNames     swishtitle desc sec
PropertyNames            desc sec</pre><p>We've described most of these directives already, but we're
defining some new MetaNames and introducing something called
PropertyNames.</p><p>In a nutshell, MetaNames are what SWISH-E actually searches
on. The default MetaName is swishdefault, and that's what is
searched on when no MetaName is specified in a query. PropertyNames
are fields that can be returned describing hits.</p><p>SWISH-E results normally are returned with several Auto
Properties including swishtitle, swishdesc, swishrank and
swishdocpath. The MetaNames directive in our configuration
specifies that we want to be able to search independently not only
on each whole document, but also on only the title, the description
or the section. The PropertyNames line specifies that we want the
sec and desc properties, the man page's section and short
description, to be returned separately with each hit.</p><p>The work of converting the man pages to XML and wrapping it
in headers for SWISH-E is performed in Listing 1
(sman-index-prog.pl).</p><p>Listing 1. sman-index-prog.pl converts man pages to XML for indexing.</p><pre     class="programlisting">#!/usr/bin/perl -w

}</pre><p>The Perl client is that simple. Let's use ours to issue
searches on our man pages such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">% ./sman -m 1 boot disk</pre><p>We should get back:</p><pre     class="programlisting">bootparam (7) Introduction to boot time para...</pre><p>But we now also can do searches like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">% ./sman sec=3 perl</pre><p>to limit searches to section 3. The sman program also accepts the
command-line option --max=# to specify the maximum number of hits
returned, --file to show the source file of the man page and --rank
to show each hit's rank for the given query:</p><pre     class="programlisting">% ./sman --max=1 --file --rank boot</pre><p>This returns:</p><pre     class="programlisting">1000 lilo.conf (5) configuration file for lilo
    /usr/man/man5/lilo.conf.5</pre><p>Notice the rank as the first column and the source file as the last
one.</p><p>An enhanced version of the sman package will be available at
<a href="http://joshr.com/src/sman" target="_self">joshr.com/src/sman/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27fd580.0x28eeba0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>SWISH-E has two downsides we should mention. First, it's not
multibyte safe&mdash;it handles only 8-bit ASCII data. Second, records
cannot be deleted from a SWISH-E index&mdash;to remove records, an index
must be re-created. On the plus side, SWISH-E has numerous features
we didn't even get to mention. See the SWISH-E web site at
<a href="http://www.swish-e.org" target="_self">www.swish-e.org</a> for
more details. We hope you'll agree that SWISH-E is an impressive
toolkit and a useful addition to your programming toolbelt.</p></div></div>
