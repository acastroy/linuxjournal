    The well-tested wxWindows is the toolkit behind the upcoming
    Chandler groupware.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212b580.0x2223608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Multiplatform development has become a
mainstream phrase over the last few years, from the halls of
Redmond to open-source initiatives. The uses of this phrase all
seem to revolve around things like Java, .NET, V and Qt; however,
let's not forget wxWindows.
</p><p>Whether you're porting some MFC code to Linux or simply want
to make your application available to the broadest user
demographic, wxWindows fits the bill. Strangely, not many people
seem to have heard of it, but hopefully, this article assists in
making the information more available.</p><p>Why choose wxWindows over these other development tools?
That's a fair question, and the answer is different for each
one.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212b580.0x22237c0"></a>Compared to the Different Tools</h2></div></div><p>Although Qt is the standard for building KDE applications,
wxWindows can be used as well. Qt's Microsoft Windows version is
not free for commercial use, but wxWindows is, and Qt requires a
special preprocessor for the event system.</p><p>Microsoft's .Net and Ximian's Mono, as well as Java, aren't
really toolkits as much as they are technologies. These
technologies add a layer to the application that can rob an
application of performance. This can be debated as a &ldquo;development
time vs. performance&rdquo; issue and is different depending on the life
cycle of the application. Instead of getting into yet another
language war, we'll simply say, &ldquo;your mileage may vary.&rdquo;</p><p>V is simply not as flexible as wxWindows; it doesn't support
as many compilers.</p><p>In comparing wxWindows to these other multiplatform
development tools and languages, it's important to mention that
wxWindows stands on its own merits and is not limited to the
comparisons.</p><p>With wxWindows, you gain the usual open-source freedoms&mdash;the
freedom to use without charge, the freedom to modify and the
freedom from the risk of vendors disappearing (or updating their
libraries or tools so that you have to buy a new one). Plus, you
have the freedom to run the application on a variety of operating
systems, including UNIX/Linux, Windows, Mac OS 9, Mac OS X and OS2.
What's more, it gives you a native look and feel on each operating
system. The license for wxWindows is flexible and has been approved
by the Open Source Initiative.</p><p>With about 11 years behind it, wxWindows is a stable, mature
development library with real-time support through the main mailing
lists found on the web site,
<a href="http://wxWindows.org" target="_self">wxWindows.org</a>. Many
features are available through more than 300 classes and 5,000
functions. Porting an application from the MFC is also
straightforward with this library.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212b580.0x2223ad8"></a>Applications That Use wxWindows</h2></div></div><p>Some major companies are using wxWindows, including AMD, the
Intel Graphics Lab, the Compaq Alpha Microprocessor Development
Group, Netscape and Lockheed Martin. The Open Source Applications
Foundation is implementing it (using wxPython) in their new
program, Chandler, for managing personal information and
collaborating with others.</p><p>Helpblocks
(<a href="http://www.helpblocks.com" target="_self">www.helpblocks.com</a>)
is an application that creates multiplatform Help files and is
developed with the wxWindows library running on both Windows and
Linux. Other applications include Vulcan 3-D (modeling software for
the mining industry, and more), Display Doctor from SciTech,
Intuitive MX (a multitrack audio mixer with 3-D representation of
the mixing stage, by Intuitive Works) and Ground Control Station
from Geneva Aerospace. Your application could be next on this
list.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212b580.0x2223c90"></a>Beginning Linux Development with
wxWindows</h2></div></div><p>You'll need GCC and also can use tools such as gdb, ddd,
Emacs and an IDE such as Anjuta. To compile on Windows, you may
need a cross-compiler. Most importantly, you'll need the wxWindows
library itself, which also is available at the wxWindows web site
as a download or CD purchase. The latest stable release at the time
of this writing is version 2.4.0.</p><p>Despite what many of us do, it's a good idea to read the
documentation relevant to Linux development that is found in the
library package.</p><p>Also, it would be wise to subscribe to the wx-user mailing
list (found under Support at
<a href="http://wxWindows.org" target="_self">wxWindows.org</a>), in case
you run into difficulties. The most reasonable thing to do is
search the archives to see if your question already has been
asked.</p><p>The library itself comes with 70+ example applications that
demonstrate almost everything imaginable you would want to do with
it; these in themselves are probably the best documentation because
you can tinker with a working application and see how it was done.
Once you get the library and become familiar with how to use it
with your tools, you're ready to start coding.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212b580.0x2223ef8"></a>A Sample or Two</h2></div></div><p>Creating a simple application class is easy. Listing 1
provides a basic sample of creating a wxApp class.</p><p>As you can see, creating a main wxWindows application is
rather easy, and those of you familiar with MFC may be rubbing your
chin thoughtfully. You'll be glad to know there is no MFC in it,
nor will there ever be MFC in it, but the classes are a simple
transition from MFC. It has few things MFC doesn't, and it does not
support OLE.</p><p><a href="6778l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Creating a wxApp
Class</a></p><p>An empty Event table is present in Listing 1, which allows
you to handle events, such as a mouse click or a key pressed or
your own custom events. Of course, this code shows a rather boring
main application that sits there and stares at you without even
blinking.</p><p>Working examples abound with the library; every single class
appears to have an example demonstrating its usage. One example is
the event-handling sample, by Vadim Zeitlin. This example is used
because many developers beginning to use the wxWindows library seem
to have some problems with events; you'll now be ahead of the game.
You need the wxWindows library to try this, and if you do, you get
the full source code for it under the Samples directory.</p><p>There's even a Wiki linked to from the site, so you can
access the latest documentation quickly and even correct it if you
find something to add.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212b580.0x2224210"></a>Give the Developers Their Due</h2></div></div><p>Aside from the cast of thousands, a core development team
should receive special mention and thanks:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Julian Smart,
<a href="http://www.anthemion.co.uk" target="_self">www.anthemion.co.uk</a></p></li><li><p>Robin Dunn,

<a href="http://www.roebling.de" target="_self">www.roebling.de</a></p></li></ul></div><p>These developers frequently are seen helping users of the
wxWindows library on a daily, if not hourly, basis on the wx-user
mailing list.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212b580.0x22249f8"></a>wxWindows: the Future</h2></div></div><p>The release of version 2.4.0 of the wxWindows library was
followed by requests from the development team for what they would
like to see in version 3.0. New ports are always in the works, and
the next release should be no different. One of the ports expected
is the Windows CE port from Marco Cavallini and Robert
Roebling.</p><p>Winelib support also is on the way, courtesy of the Winelib
team, and proprietary tools for porting from MFC to wxWindows are
being worked on by Julian Smart and Stefan Csomor.</p><p>With more and more companies wanting to use Linux, they will
be looking for ways to port their MFC code to Linux, and one of the
simplest is with the wxWindows library. The cost alone makes it
worthwhile. Development issues for porting from the MFC are
minimalized due to the simplicity of the library itself. Thus, if a
company is looking to change from a Windows-based system to a
Linux-based system, they can expect an easy porting of any code
that they have. A wxNet port is even in progress.</p><p>Perhaps you have something to add to the many applications
done with wxWindows. An up-to-date list of wxWindows applications
is available at
<a href="http://wxWindows.org" target="_self">wxWindows.org</a>.</p></div></div>
