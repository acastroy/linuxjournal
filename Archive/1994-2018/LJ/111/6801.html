    Make your web site's workflow system operate the way your
    content providers and users want it to work. Develop with
    the Python-based content management framework.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d20580.0x1e185b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the last few months, we have looked
at content management in general and at the open-source Plone
content management system (CMS) in particular. Plone certainly is a
capable CMS, one that people can use almost immediately upon
installation. The main advantage of Plone is its simplicity&mdash;it's
easy to install, easy to use and easy to customize.
</p><p>But customizing Plone, or any CMS, can go only so far. If you
dislike Plone's boxy look, you undoubtedly can change it in favor
of a different model. But if you want a completely different
workflow than the one Plone provides, it probably is a waste of
time and effort to try to make that sort of change. Rather, it
makes sense to write your own CMS or customize one that is designed
to be flexible (if more complex) in this area.</p><p>Indeed, most CMS vendors recognize that their products need
to be customizable if they are going to be useful. If you buy a
J2EE-based CMS&mdash;and a large percentage of commercial CMS offerings
are based on J2EE&mdash;you can expect to be able to write new Java
objects that describe your content and the way it is published. At
a certain point, the division between customizing a CMS and writing
your own CMS on an existing infrastructure becomes somewhat
blurry.</p><p>Enter Zope's content management framework (CMF), designed to
provide enough infrastructure for you to create your own CMS.
Because Zope development is fairly quick and easy, and because you
can use the existing infrastructure that Zope provides, it should
be possible to create a CMS at least as quickly (and far more
cheaply) than would be possible using a commercial CMS
implementation. Plone is implemented on top of CMF, rather than on
its own, meaning each time CMF is improved, Plone benefits from
those changes.</p><p>This month we look at CMF, which is becoming the central
focus of the Zope application server. Indeed, although the latest
stable version of CMF is 1.3.1, an alpha version of CMF 2.0 is now
available. And, if Zope's future directions were any mystery before
now, it is clear that CMF 2.0 is &ldquo;a lightly repackaged head
checkout of Zope3&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d20580.0x1e18818"></a>Installing and Configuring CMF</h2></div></div><p>We covered how to install CMF several months ago [see At the
Forge, <i  >LJ</i>, May 2003], so I won't go into
detail here. In short, download the latest version from
<a href="http://cmf.zope.org" target="_self">cmf.zope.org</a> and unpack
the tarfile into lib/python/Products under your Zope home
directory. Then, make symbolic links from the Products directory
into the CMF directory for CMFCore, CMFDefault, CMFTopic and
CMFCalendar. Restart Zope, and you should see a number of
CMF-related products appear in the Add menu within the Zope
management screen.</p><p>Before we can create any CMF objects, we first need to create
a container in which our CMF site can exist. You might notice an
obvious parallel here between creating a Plone site and a CMF site.
To create a new CMF site, simply choose CMF Site from the Add menu
in the web-based Zope management interface. You are asked to name
the CMF site, as well as to provide a description.</p><p>When you create a CMF site, you also are asked if you want a
new user folder within that CMF site or if you want to use an
existing user folder. For now, use the existing user folder,
meaning that users defined within the top-level Zope site are users
within the CMF site. If you prefer to make your CMF site a
self-contained unit, without reference (except for the site owner)
to the outside world, you may want to create your own user
folder.</p><p>When you have finished creating your CMF site, you are taken
to the home page, which tells you to visit the basic configuration
form. Because the CMF originally was known as the Portal Toolkit
(PTK), many of the screens refer to portals rather than CMF sites.
The information you enter in this form is fairly general in nature,
allowing you to set, for example, the e-mail addresses from which
generated e-mail appears to come as well as the site's SMTP
server.</p><p>Things get much more interesting if you follow the directions
and go to the CMF management interface, which is really the Zope
management interface for the CMF site. In other words, if your CMF
site is known as /cmfdemo, you can look at the contents of the site
with /cmfdemo/manage. The management screen, as usual in Zope,
consists of a small navigation bar on the left. But, as we saw last
month, the left side contains a number of portal tools, allowing us
to configure and modify our CMF site.</p><p>Clicking on portal catalog reveals a vocabulary, Zope's term
for an index, that explains how CMF sites are able to provide
full-text search without any effort from the site administrator.
Clicking on portal types reveals a list of content object classes.
These classes form the core of CMF. We look at the content types in
greater detail below and will examine how to create our own content
types next month.</p><p>Finally, click on portal_workflow, which allows you to enter
the title of the workflow object you would like to use for each
content type. Workflow describes how content moves from writing to
publishing, ensuring that only appropriate people are given the
authority to perform certain tasks. Authors may write stories, for
example, but be unable to publish them to the site. A good workflow
system allows you to customize these rules to reflect your
organization's needs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d20580.0x1e18be0"></a>A Simple CMF Site</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have examined the CMF control panel, it's time to
examine our site. Upon entering a bare CMF site, we see a main
content area in the middle, with several toolbars and boxes in
various places. The topmost menu has main navigation links for
moving to the top of the site to member pages to the news page and
for searching through the site's contents. Underneath that menu,
but still in the upper-right corner, is a list of user-specific
menus, beginning with My Preferences. This allows logged-in users
to set their own preferences, add links to their personal list of
favorites and log out. Users who have not logged in to the system
are invited to do so if they already have an account or to join the
system as a member if they do not yet have an account. On the left
is a navigation menu that lists available folders and allows you to
set up certain features, such as syndication and local
roles.</p><p>If you're used to looking at Plone sites, the default CMF
site might look a bit spartan but largely familiar. This is because
the default CMF site is designed to be used within a custom CMS;
even though it is completely functional, it is not designed to be
used in real life. By defining new content types and modifying the
display skins, you can have a CMS running in almost no time. And
because the display logic is separate from the rest of the system,
it is possible to change the look and feel relatively
quickly.</p><p>Every member of a CMF site can be assigned to one or more
roles: Member, Reviewer, Manager or Owner. All of these, except
Reviewer, should be familiar to experienced Zope users and
administrators. The additional role is necessary for handling
workflow, in which reviewers must approve content before it is
published to the Web.</p><p>Administrators are shown an extended menu on the left side of
the screen, allowing them to look at a content view of the current
folder, which lets them view or modify existing content or create
new content within the folder. When you create a new object, you
not only assign it an ID (what traditional web systems call a
filename) and content, but also metadata that describes the
content. Although you cannot change an object's type after it has
been instantiated, you can change all of its parameters by
returning to the content view and opening the content in
question.</p><p>Each piece of content must be published before it can be
visible to others. By default, new content has a status of private,
but it can be published by clicking the publish link on the left
menubar. Using the same interface, the site administrator can
revoke an article from the site's published list. This is a great
improvement over traditional web sites, where we remove links or
delete files.</p><p>In addition, most content types can have discussions
optionally attached to them. This is similar to the Comment on This
Posting feature so popular on weblogs, allowing site visitors to
add their comments to what the official site administrators have
written. As you add a piece of content, you can decide if you want
to accept the default site definition for discussions or if you
would like to override the site-wide setting specifically for one
piece.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d20580.0x1e18ea0"></a>Content Types</h2></div></div><p>Exactly what are these content types that we can instantiate?
Most of them are defined in the CMFDefault product, in individual
.py files within lib/python/Products/CMFDefault. This product
defines both the configuration tools we saw earlier in the Zope
management interface and also the basic content types, such as
NewsItem, Portal, Image and Link, that we can instantiate from
within the CMF.</p><p>If you're like me, you are surprised and impressed by the
small size of most of the default content types defined in the CMF.
They range from 100 lines at the low end for NewsItem to under 350
lines for Portal. This not only means it is easy to debug and
change these content types if issues come up but that adding a new
content type is relatively easy.</p><p>Indeed, a number of new content types for CMF have been
developed, and it seems to be a growing field. For example, if you
visit the CMF Collective Project at
<a href="http://collective.sf.net" target="_self">collective.sf.net</a>,
you can see a number of CMF-related products that have been
released in recent months. For example, fledgling CMF products are
available for ecommerce, photo albums and weblog creation. As CMF
becomes increasingly popular, you can expect to see the CMF
Collective similarly grow in popularity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d20580.0x1e190b0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Because Zope Corp. has said repeatedly that CMF is the future
of Zope, and because installing a CMS can be so outrageously
expensive, it is clear that Zope Corp. seriously is trying to
underbid and outperform its proprietary counterparts. However,
because Zope and CMF are open source, we can use them in our own
projects both to learn about content management and to edit and
publish different items. Next month, we dive in a bit more deeply,
looking at how to write your own sample CMF content type.</p></div></div>
