    Vendor tales about &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; are fine, but how is Linux
    changing the way regular companies do and manage information
    technology?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1be9580.0x1ce14a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Two perspectives exist regarding Linux's
success in the enterprise: one from the inside and one from the
outside. Insiders credit the organization's intelligence,
resourcefulness and expertise. Outsiders credit vendors with the
same qualities. Credit is due to both, of course, and to some
degree each side gives some credit to the other. But the press
generally takes the outside view, giving the lion's share of credit
to vendors. As a result, little credit goes to the qualities that
really account for successful use of Linux in the enterprise.
</p><p>No two inside stories are the same. Every vendor-side story
basically is about how products solve problems&mdash;that's why vendors
love to call their products &ldquo;solutions&rdquo;. But Linux isn't about
&ldquo;solutions&rdquo;. That's a vendor word. Linux is about resourcefulness
and intelligence. Those are customer words. Linux succeeds in the
enterprise by helping smart companies make themselves smarter. With
Linux and open source, the primary supply and demand sides of the
marketplace both reside inside the company.</p><p>This coexistence is a hard development for many of us to
understand. It's hard for vendors because they're used to a
marketplace where the supply side is in control and wide profit
margins are the ideal, even if they are no longer the norm. It's
hard for the press to understand, because so many of the news
stories they write are vendor-vs.-vendor sportscasts, in which the
marketplace is a playing field and customers are prizes. It's hard
for corporate leadership to understand, because they're so used to
playing the prize role in vendor playoffs.</p><p>The people who don't find it hard to understand are the
people who use Linux to make their companies more efficient, more
reliable and more effective. Take the case of LSI Logic, the
semiconductor maker. Roland Smith is the director of Global
Operations there, running one of four groups that report to the
company's CIO. The company's big switch to Linux happened a while
back when Smith's team recommended replacing HP-UX with Linux,
increasing performance five- or sixfold and cutting costs by
two-thirds. Now, Smith says, &ldquo;Whenever somebody comes in and wants
to talk to the CIO about a new application, or a project or
anything new, the CIO's question is, 'Does it run on
Linux?&rdquo;'</p><p>This environment has some interesting effects on the flow of
help. Smith provides an excellent case of help flowing from
customer to vendor:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In our SAP environment, we recently decided we
wanted to begin inserting Linux application servers. So we went out
and talked to both Dell and HP. We told them what we wanted from
each of them was an eval server&mdash;one they think is best suited to
run Linux. We wanted four processors and a gig of memory.
</p><p>A couple of interesting things happened. One was HP fumbled
around and took two weeks to come back and say, &ldquo;What do you
really need?&rdquo; The other was that Dell took three days and shipped
us a server. They said, &ldquo;Here. You've got it for three months. Go
tell us what you can do with it.&rdquo; That was kind of
wonderful.</p><p>So, then we went to SAP and said, &ldquo;What do you recommend?&rdquo;
And SAP said, &ldquo;Well, we think SuSE 8 runs okay. And we think that
Red Hat 7.1 runs okay. But we don't really know.&rdquo; Then we went and
talked to Red Hat and they said, &ldquo;We think it'll run nicely on our
Advanced Server 2.1, but we don't really know. So how about you go
try it out and tell us?&rdquo;</p><p>So, we built it. We bought the Red Hat application server,
built it, loaded SAP on it and put it in our test environment. And
it's running incredibly well. We're very happy with it. But it's
interesting to me that, of all the vendors out there, only Dell
said, &ldquo;We'll happily give you hardware to try it out on, but we
don't know anything more than that.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>Where LSI is concerned, most of the intelligence and
leadership is located on the customer side.
</p><p>Another smart customer is Orbitz, the on-line travel company
owned by five major airlines. Leon Chism, chief internet architect
for Orbitz, says this about how the company applies its own
intelligence internally:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Our developers are very good at leveraging
open-source tools to improve our design, build and software
management process. On their own they have built a number of tools
that parse logs, store them in a PostgreSQL database and do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ex post facto</em></span> analysis to find errors and
opportunities for improvement. The first I heard of one tool was
after it had been used to do analysis and improve some sections of
the code successfully several times. We also have a number of
developers and engineers using tools like Perl, Python and Jython
(we employ an official Jython developer) for their own ad hoc tools
to help them monitor site behavior. All of this is in addition to
the official production management infrastructure. Generally, after
a tool has been developed, tested and proven useful, we migrate it
into the rest of the management infrastructure our Network
Operations Center uses.</p></blockquote></div><p>He also sees the use of Linux and open source as competitive
advantages for Orbitz:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Orbitz is a company that leverages open-source
projects in its production environment and isn't afraid to be
public about it. We currently use over 750 Linux machines in our
production environment. Our web servers are Apache running on
Linux, our application servers are proprietary servlet engines
running on Linux and the back-end &ldquo;booking engine&rdquo; is comprised
entirely of Java services running on Linux. Lastly, the software
that does the low fare searching that is one of the key
differentiators between Orbitz and our rivals also is running on
Linux.</p></blockquote></div>

From the examples of LSI and Orbitz, we have a pretty good idea
about how Linux and open-source smarts are applied, both within the
enterprise and between the enterprise and its outside suppliers.
Now what about the outside view? An excellent example is provided
by William M. Bulkeley, in &ldquo;Out of the Shadows: Open-source
software is not only becoming acceptable&mdash;It's also becoming a big
business&rdquo;&mdash;a feature that ran in the March 31, 2003,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span>:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Companies have found ways to make money by
providing services to open-source-software users or by packaging
this free software with products they sell. With the profit motive
driving its promotion, free software is cropping up all over
corporate and government computers.</p></blockquote></div>

When I first saw that piece, I thought, &ldquo;Cool!&rdquo; But then I began
to ask some questions:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Why is it most important that &ldquo;companies have
found ways to make money&rdquo;? Is that more important than the actual
work that gets done?</p></li><li><p>Why does he say &ldquo;companies&rdquo; when he means
&ldquo;vendors&rdquo;? Aren't customers companies too?</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>And let's face it: Linux users are tough customers. Here's
Leon Chism again:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>On the relationship front, there is a vendor that
we have and are still considering replacing with an open-source
solution. For the most part, the application works, but when we
find bugs in it the resolution process leaves a lot to be desired.
Escalation procedures, arguments about root cause, long discussions
about &ldquo;supported configurations&rdquo; all lead to muddling the process
rather than focusing on the solution.
</p><p>When we have issues or questions with Linux or Apache, these
things aren't at issue. We simply use the customer service
application to end all customer service
applications&mdash;<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_self">www.google.com</a>&mdash;and
start researching. Or we start perusing source code. Orbitz is a
customer that typically pushes the limits of the products we use.
Some vendors are up for the challenge and are willing to make
efforts to support that need. Some aren't. And we don't know who is
who until, as they say, push comes to shove. Using open-source
products removes that issue. We have an engineering and software
development staff that is fully capable of paddling its own canoe,
and the support we get from authors, list servs and Google is more
than enough in most cases.</p></blockquote></div><p>Yet the tough vendor story gets played while the tough
customer story does not.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1be9580.0x1ce2058"></a>The Intelligence Imperative</h2></div></div><p>Dell may be the top-selling PC brand, but the real
best-sellers are no-name &ldquo;white&rdquo; boxes that are bought by the ton
or built out of industry-standard parts on an as-needed basis.
Customers love them, because they're cheap to buy and easy to
replace. But we don't hear much about them. One reason we don't is
their builders don't spend much money on advertising and PR. But a
bigger reason is the computer industry has a long-standing
prejudice against the word &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; and has a huge fear of
&ldquo;commodification&rdquo;.</p><p>Commodification has long been a fact of life in the hardware
business, but software still is widely considered a big margin
category. Microsoft has a bad quarter when gross profit margins
slip below 80%, and Oracle's worst quarter in the last five (at the
time of this writing) was still over 75%.</p><p>But the software industry will have to face the fact that
customers love commodities. One good example is the University
Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR,
<a href="http://www.ucar.edu/ucar/index.html" target="_self">www.ucar.edu/ucar/index.html</a>)
in Boulder, Colorado. In spite of its name, UCAR is a business with
substantial customers that include the national air traffic control
system. Greg Thompson, a scientist with UCAR, explains the
decision-making process there:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Everybody here has a shelf full of O'Reilly
books. We like to figure things out for ourselves. For example, I'm
a scientist, not a programmer. But a while back I saw a need to get
past manipulating data with Perl and text files. So I started
reading up on databases and learning MySQL. I wouldn't have
bothered if MySQL hadn't been free. We don't have five-digit
figures around here to run Oracle. We don't need hard-core database
stuff. We don't need transaction support. But we do need results
that are Web-accessible, so MySQL made sense. Building internal
expertise around something like MySQL is straightforward and easy.
I do a little research on my own, see if something I need is
already installed&mdash;and if it's not, I send a help-desk e-mail to a
sysadmin. Then, the next day I download a Debian package, run
<b  >apt-get</b> and I'm in business. Without spending a
dime.</p></blockquote></div><p>It's amazing how small a software approval bureaucracy can
get. When friction is low and costs are zero, free enterprise lives
up to its name. &ldquo;Our IT budget is zero&rdquo;, says Elliot Noss,
president and CEO of Tucows
(<a href="http://tucows.com" target="_self">tucows.com</a>) in Toronto.
Tucows' business is hosting one of the largest software download
sites in the world, plus running one of the three top-level domain
name registries (OpenSRS,
<a href="http://resellers.tucows.com/opensrs" target="_self">resellers.tucows.com/opensrs</a>),
which manages around 3.5 million domain names, all on Linux,
Apache, MySQL and PostgreSQL. &ldquo;I can't even imagine what it would
cost to work with a big Sun system or to run a big Oracle
database&rdquo;, Noss says.
</p><p>Although network and technology companies are more willing to
talk about using Linux and open source, other types of companies
are quietly changing the way they handle software, too. Take this
e-mail, for example, whose author requested anonymity:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I work for a Fortune 50 company whose IT has a
new open-source policy, as well as a fully approved open-source
toolkit (with an internal &ldquo;brand name&rdquo;) available for employee
download from an internal web site. Already up to version 3.0, it
comes in both UNIX and Windows flavors. It consists of GNU tools
and others on the UNIX side and the Cygwin toolkit on the Windows
side. Linux (Red Hat for now) is one of the &ldquo;tools&rdquo;.
</p><p>The guy who heads up the toolkit project is a
take-no-prisoners, free-software advocate, too. The stated purpose
of the policy is to permit the company to save money by eliminating
license fees and by streamlining the software acquisition process,
but the clear subtext is to make it possible for the company to
protect its intellectual property from third-party (that is,
Microsoft) manipulation.</p><p>Part of the new policy is something of &ldquo;don't ask, don't
tell&rdquo;. IT agrees not to complain if anyone decides to install
these tools on whatever computer they use. All any nonmanagement
employee now needs to do is get approval from his or her local
manager to download and install the tools. Managers do not need
anyone's permission to install the tools for themselves. Per the
policy, IT does not get involved in any way. So spread of the
tools&mdash;of Linux and the rest of the free software suite&mdash;happens
naturally and organically.</p><p>Before the policy was implemented, even GNU Emacs required an
official IT review/approval process. Even if your boss wanted it,
IT could fight it if they wanted to. But with this new policy,
that's now history.</p></blockquote></div><p>Policy inevitably adapts to new facts of development life
inside an organization. Today the trends among those facts favor
Linux, big time. In a recent survey of Linux developers (who also
work with other platforms), Evans Data Corp. observed a rapid shift
away from proprietary UNIXes and Windows, in the direction of
Linux:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Linux is the primary choice of host platform at
40%. Windows 2000 makes a strong showing at 29%, with Windows XP
right behind at 12%. The landscape is about to change,
however....Next year respondents plan to increase their use of
Linux as the primary development platform by 15%, from 40% to
55%.</p></blockquote></div>

When my coauthors and I wrote <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cluetrain
Manifesto</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.cluetrain.com" target="_self">www.cluetrain.com</a>)
in 1999, we said, &ldquo;markets are getting smarter&mdash;and getting
smarter faster than most companies.&rdquo; Four years later, we see
something similar happening inside companies with respect to their
technology vendors. The result is an ecosystem that subordinates
vendors to work. This is good for everybody, including vendors&mdash;it
means the industry is finally growing up.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1be9580.0x1ce2840"></a>Vendors: Giving Customers What They Want</h2></div></div><p>The new imperative for vendors is to give customers what they
want and not bother trying to lock them into no-choice
relationships. They've had enough of that, thank you. M&aring;rten
Mickos, CEO of MySQL
(<a href="http://mysql.com" target="_self">mysql.com</a>), believes vendors
like his can help raise IT consciousness. He says, MySQL
successfully sells free software (MySQL is GPLed code) because
&ldquo;there is more value to code you can see than to code you can't
see&rdquo;, adding, &ldquo;We are part of a huge community of customers and
other developers who are all passionate about improving the code
base. Every day we are proving it is possible to have a commercial
relationship that benefits free software.&rdquo;</p><p>That commercial relationship still is not one that happens
between the tops of the vendor and customer bureaucracies. Among
big customers it happens down among the middle tiers on both sides.
For MySQL, that list of customers is impressive, and it includes
Nokia, Yahoo, NASA, Silicon Graphics and Cisco. Jeremy Zawody, a
self-described &ldquo;technical yahoo&rdquo; with Yahoo Finance, says,
&ldquo;MySQL will penetrate the enterprise similarly to the way
(Microsoft) SQL Server did, but with much greater speed. MySQL is
to Oracle as Linux is to Windows. It will slowly but steadily creep
up the food chain, just like Linux has.&rdquo; But when I asked
M&aring;rten Mickos if MySQL is competing with Oracle yet, he said
no. &ldquo;We complement Oracle far more than we compete with
it.&rdquo;</p><p>Still, we're at a point in history where the action is
clearly shifting up the stack, from operating systems and
applications to data. &ldquo;We think it's the information age, not the
operating system age&rdquo;, Larry Ellison says. &ldquo;The OS manages
hardware; we manage the software.&rdquo;</p><p>Because more and more of that software runs on Linux, Oracle
has wisely chucked its long-standing OS agnosticism and
repositioned itself, alongside IBM, as one of the world's leading
&ldquo;Linux companies&rdquo;. Wim Coekaerts
(<a href="http://otn.oracle.com/oramag/Coekaerts.html" target="_self">otn.oracle.com/oramag/Coekaerts.html</a>),
head of Oracle's Linux kernel team, says &ldquo;Linux is really, really
important to Oracle. We are very much a Linux company.&rdquo; He proudly
credits the work his kernel development team has contributed to
helping to make Linux &ldquo;enterprise class&rdquo;. There is proof in the
customer pudding, too. Roland Smith says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I would say that Oracle is probably the best
vendor in the marketplace, in respect to Linux. When we told our
Oracle account team that we wanted to put up an Oracle database on
Linux, they were all over it. They really knew what they were
doing. Within a week they had us in touch with their development
folks back in Redwood Shores. They had good documentation. It was
easy to put up. They were patient. It was easy to run, easy to
connect to. We're very happy about it.</p></blockquote></div><p>Smart companies naturally want smart relationships. Oracle
seems to be doing a good job of meeting that market demand. It
should help them continue to adapt to the successes of MySQL and
PostgreSQL.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1be9580.0x1ce2c08"></a>The New Standard Story</h2></div></div><p>Like Oracle, other vendors will need to adapt to a world
where Linux and its open-source companions serve as fundamental
infrastructure for IT. That infrastructure is quickly becoming as
standard as two-by-fours, ten-penny nails and sheetrock screws.
Vendors always will be welcome to take advantage of that
infrastructure and to contribute to its improvement; but their
frame of reference will shift from the abstract to the
concrete&mdash;from abstract playing fields to concrete IT projects
where they have something useful to contribute. When that happens,
and the software industry finishes growing up, credit will finally
go where it's long overdue: to the smart people who used Linux to
make their companies smarter, no matter what those companies bought
and sold.</p></div></div>
