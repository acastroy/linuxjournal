    OpenLDAP offers the convenience of a common directory across
    all applications. And if you set it up right, it will make
    your network more secure, not less.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1816580.0x190e768"></a></h2></div></div><p>Suppose you have an Internet Mail Access
Protocol (IMAP) server and a bunch of users, but you don't want to
give each user a shell account on the server. You'd rather use some
sort of central user-authentication service that can be used for
other tasks as well. While you're at it, you also need an on-line
address book for your organization's e-mail and groupware
applications. And suppose, in addition to all that, you also need
to provide your users with encryption tools that use X.509
certificates and then manage digital certificates for your entire
organization.
</p><p>Would you believe that one service can address all four
scenarios? The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) does
all of this and more. And wouldn't you know it, the Open Source
community is blessed with a free, stable and fully functional LDAP
server and client package that is already part of most Linux
distributions: OpenLDAP.</p><p>The only catch is LDAP is a complicated beast. To make sense
of it, you're going to have to add still more acronyms and some
heavy-duty abstractions to your bag of UNIX tricks. But armed with
the next few months' Paranoid Penguin columns and a little
determination, you'll have the mighty LDAP burro pulling several
large plows simultaneously, making your network both more secure
and easier to use. In my experience, &ldquo;more secure&rdquo; and &ldquo;simpler
for end users&rdquo; rarely go hand in hand, so I'm excited finally to
be covering OpenLDAP in this column.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1816580.0x190e920"></a>LDAP Basics</h2></div></div><p>In a nutshell, LDAP provides directory services, a
centralized database of essential information about the people,
groups and other entities that comprise an organization. As every
organization's structure and its precise definition of essential
information may be different, a directory service must be highly
flexible and customizable. It's therefore an inherently complex
undertaking.</p><p>The X.500 protocol for directory services is a case in point.
It was designed to provide large-scale directory services for large
and complex organizations. Accordingly, X.500 is itself a large and
complex protocol, so much so that a lightweight version of it was
created: the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. LDAP, described
in RFC 1777, is essentially a subset of the X.500 protocol, and
it's been implemented far more widely than X.500 itself has
been.</p><p>X.500 and LDAP are open protocols, like TCP/IP; neither is a
standalone product. A protocol has to be implemented in some sort
of software, such as a kernel module, a server d&aelig;mon or a
client program. Also like TCP/IP, not all implementations of LDAP
are alike or even completely interoperable (without modification).
The particular LDAP implementation we cover here is OpenLDAP, but
you should be aware that other software products provide
alternative implementations. These include Netscape Directory
Server, Sun ONE Directory Server and even, in a limited way,
Microsoft Active Directory in Windows 2000 Server.</p><p>Luckily, LDAP is designed to be extensible. Creating an LDAP
database on one platform that is compatible with other LDAP
implementations is usually a simple matter of adjusting the
database's record formats, or schema, which we'll discuss next
month. Therefore, it's no problem to run an OpenLDAP server on a
Linux system that can provide address book functionality to users
running, say, Netscape Communicator on Macs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1816580.0x190eb30"></a>Getting and Installing OpenLDAP</h2></div></div><p>Being such a useful and important tool, OpenLDAP is included
in most major Linux distributions. Generally, it's split across
multiple packages: server d&aelig;mons in one package, client
programs in another, development libraries in still another. This
article is about building an LDAP server, so naturally you'll want
to install your distribution's OpenLDAP server package, plus
OpenLDAP runtime libraries if they aren't included in the server
package.</p><p>You might be tempted to forego installing the OpenLDAP client
commands on your server if no local user accounts will be on it and
you expect all LDAP transactions to occur over the network.
However, these client commands are useful for testing and
troubleshooting, so I strongly recommend you install them.</p><p>The specific packages comprising OpenLDAP in Red Hat are
openldap (OpenLDAP libraries, configuration files and
documentation); openldap-clients (OpenLDAP client
software/commands); openldap-servers (OpenLDAP server programs);
and openldap-devel (headers and libraries for developers). Although
these packages have a number of fairly mundane dependencies,
including glibc, two are required packages you may not have
installed already: cyrus-sasl and cyrus-sasl-md5, which help broker
authentication transactions with OpenLDAP.</p><p>In SuSE, OpenLDAP is provided in the following RPMs:
openldap2-client (in section n1 of SuSE versions 7.3 and 8.0);
openldap2 (includes both the OpenLDAP libraries and server
d&aelig;mons and is found in section n2); and openldap2-devel
(found in section n2 for SuSE 7.3 and n4 for SuSE 8.0). As with Red
Hat, be sure to install the package cyrus-sasl, located in SuSE's
sec1 directory.</p><p>In both the 7.3 and 8.0 distributions, SuSE provides packages
for OpenLDAP versions 1.2 and 2.0. Be sure to install the newer 2.0
packages listed in the previous paragraph, unless you have a
specific reason to run OpenLDAP 1.2. This guideline does not apply
to Red Hat or Debian, both of which are standardized on OpenLDAP
2.0 in their current distributions.</p><p>For Debian 3.0 (Woody), the equivalent deb packages are:
libldap2 (OpenLDAP libraries, in Debian's libs directory); slapd
(the OpenLDAP server package, found in the net directory); and
ldap-utils (OpenLDAP client commands, also found in the net
directory). You'll also need libsasl7 from the Debian libs
directory.</p><p>If your distribution of choice doesn't have binary packages
for OpenLDAP, or if a specific feature of the latest version of
OpenLDAP is lacking in your distribution's OpenLDAP packages or if
you need to customize OpenLDAP at the binary level, you always can
compile it yourself from source you've downloaded from the official
OpenLDAP web site at
<a href="http://www.openldap.org" target="_self">www.openldap.org</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1816580.0x190eea0"></a>Configuring and Starting slapd</h2></div></div><p>The main server d&aelig;mon in OpenLDAP is called slapd, and
configuring this program is the first step in getting OpenLDAP
working once it's installed. Its configuration is determined
primarily by the file /etc/openldap/slapd.conf. The &ldquo;OpenLDAP 2.0
Administrator's Guide&rdquo; at
<a href="http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin20/guide.html" target="_self">www.openldap.org/doc/admin20/guide.html</a>
has an excellent quick-start procedure for getting slapd up and
running: it's in Section 2, starting at Step 8. That document also
explains directory services and LDAP concepts in more depth than
this article does, using tree/hierarchy diagrams.</p><p>Let's walk through this procedure to make sure you get off to
a good start. The first thing to do is edit slapd.conf, an example
of which is shown in Listing 1. As you can see, slapd.conf is a
typical Linux configuration file: each line consists of a parameter
name followed by a value.</p><p><a href="6789l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Customized Part of
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf</a></p><p>The first parameter shown in Listing 1, database, specifies
what type of database back end to use. Usually, the best choice
here is ldbm, which uses the fast dbm database format, but shell
(for custom shell-script back ends) and passwd (to use /etc/passwd
as the back end) also are valid choices. There may be multiple
database definitions, each with its own set of applicable
parameters; all the lines in Listing 1 comprise a single database
definition.</p><p>The next parameter in Listing 1 is suffix, which determines
what queries match this database definition. Here, the specified
suffix is wiremonkeys.org, expressed in LDAP-speak as a series of
domain component (dc) statements, which are parsed from left to
right. In other words, if an LDAP client queries our example server
for information about the distinguished name (dn)
cn=bubba,dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org, our server matches that query
against this database definition, as the dn ends with
dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org. See the Sidebar &ldquo;A Crash Course in X.500
Naming&rdquo; for more information about distinguished names.</p><p><a href="6789s1.html" target="_self">Sidebar: A Crash Course in X.500
Naming</a></p><p>The next two entries in Listing 1 have to do with LDAP
database administration; rootdn and rootpw specify the user name
and password, respectively, that must be supplied by remote or
local commands that perform administrative actions on the LDAP
database. Interestingly, this entry is used
<span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> for this purpose. It doesn't show up in
regular LDAP database queries.</p><p>This addresses the paradox of how to authenticate the actions
required to populate the authentication (LDAP) database. Later,
after you've populated your LDAP database with real entity records,
designate one of them as the administrative account, using
slapd.conf access control lists (acls), and delete the rootdn and
rootpw entries. I'll cover that step in a future column; for now,
rootdn and rootpw suffice.</p><p>It's a very, very bad idea to store the value of rootpw as
clear text. Instead, you should use the
<b  >slappasswd</b> command to generate a password hash,
shown in Listing 2.</p><p><a href="6789l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. The slappasswd
Command</a></p><p>As you can see, slappasswd prompts you for a password and
prints that password hashed with the algorithm you specify with the
-h option. Be sure to enclose this value in curly brackets&mdash;see the
slappasswd(8C) man page for a list of valid choices. You can copy
and paste slappasswd's output directly into slapd.conf, which is
precisely what I did to create the rootpw value in Listing
1.</p><p>Getting back to Listing 1, the next parameter in this
directory definition is directory. Obviously enough, this specifies
in which directory on the local filesystem your LDAP directory
should be created. Because /var is the customary place for growing
files such as logs and databases, Listing 1 shows a value of
/var/lib/ldap. This directory must already exist, and make sure
it's owned by OpenLDAP's user and group, usually ldap and ldap. Its
permissions should be set to 0700
(<b  >-rwx------</b>).</p><p>Technically, that's enough to get started: you can try
starting slapd with your ldap startup script, most likely
/etc/init.d/ldap, though this may vary among distributions. I
encourage you to start adding practice entries to your LDAP
database using the <b  >ldapadd</b> command&mdash;the
quick-start procedure I mentioned earlier shows how.</p><p>Before you begin managing and querying your LDAP database
over the network, however, you'll want to configure and enable TLS
encryption. This is important, as the simple authentication method
used by OpenLDAP sends authentication credentials over the network
unencrypted. But I'm out of space for now, so we'll cover that next
month. If you can't wait until then, Vincent Danen explains how in
his on-line article &ldquo;Using OpenLDAP for Authentication&rdquo;, at
<a href="http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/docs/ldap-auth.php" target="_self">www.mandrakesecure.net/en/docs/ldap-auth.php</a>,
though it is somewhat Mandrake-centric. I'll also discuss some
considerations in determining the structure of your LDAP database
and show how to build one. Until then, good luck!</p></div></div>
