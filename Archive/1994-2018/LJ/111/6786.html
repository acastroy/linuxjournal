950MB FLAC recordings of your favorite taping-friendly band? With
Bram Cohen's BitTorrent, you can serve big files to many users at
once, even from a dial-up or DSL connection, by making the clients
do most of the work. As soon as any BitTorrent client has part of
the file, it helps serve that part to others. BitTorrent installs
easily as a helper application in Mozilla or other popular
browsers. Requires Python.</p><p>&mdash;Don Marti</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Crossfire</em></span>:

Development</h2></div></div><p>New kernel driver components are cropping up to take
advantage of modern high-speed serial ports.
<span   class="bold"><b>SuperIO</b></span> chips have supported up to
460.8K and 921.6K baud for a long time, though no Linux driver
existed. In February 2003, <span   class="bold"><b>David
Woodhouse</b></span> posted a patch to give Linux access to the
high-speed capabilities in those chips.</p><p>It's now possible to use thousands of hard drives under
Linux. The previous limit was 256. <span   class="bold"><b>Badari
Pulavarty</b></span> submitted a patch in March 2003 to raise that
limit drastically. During one test run, he successfully read from
and wrote to 4,000 distinct disks. The new limitations on the
number of disks supported by Linux still is being investigated.
Various resources become overburdened as the number of disks rises,
memory usage being the main catchall for these problems. Ways of
accommodating the RAM requirements of massive numbers of disks are
being investigated actively. A true hard limit on the number of
disks may re-emerge eventually, but not until various debris has
been cleared away.</p><p>A new GPLed graphical bootloader, called
<span   class="bold"><b>Gujin</b></span> (short for GPL Use of the
Jnp INstruction), emerged in April 2003, billing itself as a
replacement for <span   class="bold"><b>LILO</b></span>. Coded
entirely from scratch by <span   class="bold"><b>Etienne
Lorrain</b></span>, Gujin boasts the ability to identify available
kernels at boot time, which is an improvement over LILO's need to
modify the boot sector for each installed kernel; the ability to
load extremely large kernels, because LILO's size restrictions are
being strained by the growing size of recent 2.5 kernels; and a
sexy graphical interface for choosing which kernel to boot. It's
still quite a new project, so don't look for it to take over the
world in the immediate future; however, it does promise to be a
flexible, powerful alternative to LILO and
<span   class="bold"><b>GRUB</b></span>.</p><p>A new set of API functions for
<span   class="bold"><b>USB</b></span> gadgets has been produced by
<span   class="bold"><b>David Brownell</b></span>. This is intended
to be used by peripheral devices, such as PDAs and other embedded
systems running Linux. The API functions provide a consistent
interface so that software written for one peripheral device can
run unchanged on another, in spite of the fact that the two pieces
of hardware may be quite different.</p><p>Now you can track the input/output readiness of files in a
portable manner, using the new
<span   class="bold"><b>libivykis</b></span> library by
<span   class="bold"><b>Lennert Buytenhek</b></span>. This past April
he released the library as a wrapper around functions like poll()
and kqueue(), enabling a standard interface for high-performance
networking servers, regardless of the system on which they happen
to be running. The <span   class="bold"><b>SourceForge</b></span>
page for libivykis lists it as fully stable and ready for
production use, in spite of the fact that the first public release
took place only recently. Whatever the case, libivykis apparently
has been used already to produce proxy servers for various
protocols, as well as a streaming video server.</p><p>The proprietary <span   class="bold"><b>BitKeeper</b></span>
(BK) tool is becoming more and more firmly entrenched as the
version control system used in kernel development. A new real-time
BitKeeper-to-CVS gateway, set up by BitKeeper's creator,
<span   class="bold"><b>Larry McVoy</b></span>, has silenced some of
the more vocal anti-BK kernel developers. At the same time, free
alternatives like <span   class="bold"><b>arch</b></span> and
Subversion appear to be banding together, working to solve the
formidable problems that have kept free version control systems
from providing the state-of-the-art features found in
BitKeeper.</p><p>&mdash;Zack Brown</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f98580.0x2090df0"></a>Garbage Subtractor</h2></div></div><p>Students at MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6786f2.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Mike Jackson, Linux Shadow Password HOWTO author, passed away
on Friday, March 28 at the age of 38. In addition to maintaining
the LSPH all these years, Mike was also a Navy sonar instructor,
Reserve police officer, president and founding member of TSCNet,
treasurer and founding member of the Kitsap Peninsula Linux User
Group and contributor to projects such as the PHP SNMP module and
the Sharp Camera package for OpenZaurus.</p><p>The last update of the Linux Shadow Password HOWTO was in
1998. This isn't because Mike lost interest, but because the HOWTO
convinced everyone to start including shadow password support in
their distribution by default.</p><p>When Mike took on a new project, he dove in headfirst. When
he found bugs, he'd fix them and contribute the patches back to the
project. When he found a lack of some feature, he would add it
himself. He set an example for what a true hacker ought to be,
demanding excellence and openness from software and improving it
where there were flaws.</p><p>Mike's passing has deeply affected all of his family and
friends; we will miss him greatly. We have gathered together the
pieces of his home page and reassembled it along with other links
at
<a href="http://www.kplug.org/~mhjack" target="_self">www.kplug.org/~mhjack</a>.
If you have memories of Mike you would like to share, please e-mail
them to

expense of Intel systems combined with organic availability of
Linux is quickly becoming the norm, especially at reputable
engineering schools. The free availability of the source code leads
universities to standardize on Linux for computer science
courses.</p><p>&mdash;Billy Marshall, Red Hat</p><p>Continuing core development of version 3 is mostly paid for
by Hans Reiser from money made selling licenses in addition to the
GPL to companies who don't want it known that they use ReiserFS as
a foundation for their proprietary product. And my lawyer asked
&ldquo;People pay you money for this?&rdquo; Yup. Hee Hee. Life is good. If
you buy ReiserFS, you can focus on your value add rather than
reinventing an entire FS.</p><p>&mdash;mkreiserfs, in reiserfsprogs 3.6.5</p><p>The first discovery I'd like to present here is an algorithm

manage bandwidth usage on a per-program, per-IP-address basis, so
my SSH sessions are still responsive, my FTP sessions continue

get upset. Its only drawback is that you must remember to use
trickle to invoke the program for which you want the traffic
