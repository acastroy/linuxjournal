    Telecom applications have extraordinary requirements for low

describing a new event-based mechanism for Linux. This particular
article focuses on the motivation, requirements and benefits of
such a mechanism for carrier-grade Linux.
</p><p>The work of supporting a native event-based system in the
Linux kernel started as a research project in 2001 at the Open
Systems Lab (Ericsson Research, Corporate Unit) in Montr&eacute;al,
Canada. The goal was to provide Linux with an event-driven
environment that could deliver better performance compared to
existing solutions in the context of telecom applications.</p><p>There has been a growing interest in bringing the Linux
operating system to a carrier-grade level. For example, the OSDL
Carrier-Grade Linux working group
(<a href="http://www.osdl.org/projects/cgl" target="_self">www.osdl.org/projects/cgl</a>)
currently is drafting a set of requirements to turn Linux into a
solid carrier-grade server for Next Generation Networks.</p><p>Operating systems for telecom applications must ensure that
they can deliver a high response rate with minimum downtime&mdash;less
than five minutes per year, 99.999% of uptime&mdash;including hardware,
operating system and software upgrade. In addition to this goal, a
carrier-grade system also must take into account such
characteristics as scalability, high availability and
performance.</p><p>For such systems, thousands of requests must be handled
concurrently without impacting the overall system's performance,
even under high load. Subscribers can expect some latency time when
issuing a request, but they are not willing to accept an unbounded
response time. Such transactions are not handled instantaneously
for many reasons, and it can take some milliseconds or seconds to
reply. Waiting for an answer reduces applications' abilities to
handle other transactions.</p><p>Many different solutions have been envisaged to improve
Linux's capabilities using different types of software
organization, such as multithreaded architectures, by implementing
efficient POSIX interfaces or by improving the scalability of
existing kernel routines. We think that none of these solutions are
adequate for true carrier-grade servers.</p><p>

</p><p>In order to understand our point, this article provides an
overview of telecom networks. The purpose is to clarify the
requirements for a carrier-grade operating system. After this
introduction, we explain the benefits of a native asynchronous
event mechanism to better support carrier-grade
characteristics.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b2a80"></a>Carrier-Grade Requirements</h2></div></div><p>Telecommunications is concerned with the establishment of
telephone calls between two devices and the transport of voice over
wire links. Figure 1 shows the traditional Public Switched
Telephone Network (PSTN). More specifically, carriers use the term
<span   class="emphasis"><em>signaling</em></span> to indicate the establishment of a
telephone call between two devices. Signaling in the PSTN is done
through the Signaling System 7 (SS7) protocol stack. SS7 performs
call routing and builds a path to the destination telephone through
the circuits. The two phones are connected once the path is
established and the voice can be carried over. The SS7 protocol is
able to handle call routing, call forwarding and error
conditions.</p><p>The flexibility, cost performance and continuous growth of
the Internet are driving a migration of many telecom services to
it. This helps to establish IP technologies as the new standard for
all communications services. These two types of networks are based
on different technologies and require the utilization of signaling
and media gateways for inter-working purposes.</p><p>Gateways perform the translation of information between
different types of network. For example, an SS7 gateway is used to
encapsulate signaling over the IP network through the Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). A media gateway is used to
encode and decode the voice coming from the PSTN network and going
to the IP network and vice versa.</p><p>The signaling and the media gateways provide connectivity to
the IP network for calls coming from the PSTN network. Signaling
gateways must perform protocol encapsulation in order to carry the
syntax and semantics of SS7 messages over an internet protocol,
such as SCTP over IP or UDP over IP. Signaling servers must be able
to scale with respect to their system capabilities as the number of
concurrent requests increases.</p><p>With a media gateway, operators can implement transport of
streaming data between the PSTN and the IP networks. The number of
connections they can accept depends on their hardware, which can
vary in size from one to thousands of interfaces. Media gateways
must support a large number of connections in real time.</p><p>Authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) servers
maintain databases of user profiles. Typically, one or two AAA
servers may contain information about several millions of
subscribers belonging to a particular network operator. It is
common to observe peaks of thousands of concurrent authentication
requests per second. Such variation in the number of connections is
difficult to plan for in advance. AAA servers have a critical role
of controlling access to the IP network and are not allowed to
fail. They require soft real-time capabilities, so they can reply
to most requests within a few milliseconds.</p><p>Media servers provide specialized resources and services to
end users, such as video conferences, video servers, applications
and e-mail. An important aspect of these carrier-class systems is
scalability. These platforms can accept a linear increase of the
number of transactions with respect to the number of processors,
interfaces or bandwidth. Telecom operators speak of linear
scalability, meaning the cost per transaction or per user should
not increase when scaling up a server.</p><p>In case of failure or unplanned interruption, carrier-grade
platforms can recover automatically or failover to another server
through network redundancy procedures. Live software upgrades and
hot swap of hardware devices also are part of the 99.999% service
availability.</p><p>Linux has proven to be stable and consistent over the years,
and it is already an attractive option for carriers. In order to
become a key element of telecom networks, however, it must be
enhanced with components providing these much-needed carrier-grade
capabilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b2ea0"></a>Matching Performance and Architecture</h2></div></div><p>In the traditional programming model, software components
explicitly synchronize with others. This is the common model when a
lot of interaction is required. For example, the typical approach
is to use select() or poll() to listen to file descriptors. A
generic implementation of select scans the entire array of
descriptors. This is not scalable because the time it takes to
detect activity on a descriptor is proportional to the size of the
array. This increases the application latency and leads to a
decrease in the overall system performance.</p><p>Scanning an array of descriptors or waiting for data consumes
processing time. A common idea in the design of efficient
algorithms is to handle system events asynchronously. Some examples
of mechanisms that provide event notification to user-space
applications are the POSIX AIO, epoll or the BSD kqueue (see
Resources).</p><p>When describing the efficiency of such mechanisms, it is
common to compute the average time it takes from the moment an
event is detected in the kernel to the moment it is effectively
handled by the application. One of the main reasons this is done is
that micro-benchmarks for this type of method are not relevant.
Such mechanisms can be quite efficient locally but inefficient when
combined with other mechanisms not well adapted, such as
multithreaded architectures. As an example, many web servers use a
pool of threads that is started when the application is launched. A
typical architecture is to use one dedicated thread to manage
incoming connections and one thread per transaction. Usually this
design is efficient for a low number of incoming connections but is
inefficient when the load goes higher.</p><p>Multithreaded applications are needed when a high level of
concurrency is required between objects competing for the CPU.
Well-known examples are found in high-performance computing
applications where the speed of execution of every thread is
important, but the number of threads run is not high.</p><p>Threads provide a sequential and synchronous model of
development, and they have become the standard way of implementing
applications when a high level of concurrency is needed. But flaws
in the design of applications or flaws in handling synchronizations
easily can create system contentions and affect the overall system
performance. J. Ousterhout, in &ldquo;Why Threads Are a Bad Idea&rdquo;,
established that programming with threads is quite difficult and
mainly leads to applications unable to execute properly under high
loads.</p><p>No competition between threads exists in telecom
applications. But concurrency occurs when handling common objects,
such as distributed data structures. For these applications,
threads are needed to provide concurrent accesses to shared
data.</p><p>Telecom applications are used to handle thousands of
transactions per second and hundreds of simultaneous connections on
the same processor. In addition, system events, including database
accesses, applications faults, overload notifications, alarms,
state change of system components and so on, must be taken into
account. Thousands of events can be generated in the same system
during the execution of an application, so managing events with
threads would be inefficient.</p><p>Traditional asynchronous mechanisms try to solve this
scalability issue by preventing applications from waiting
unnecessarily or, like epoll on Linux, they aim to improve the
detection of active descriptors. Unfortunately, these solutions are
limited to file descriptors, which represent only a fraction of the
events of interest. Also, starting a huge number of threads, as
needed for web servers to handle these events, would create a
bottleneck and aggravate the situation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b3210"></a>Event-Based Architectures</h2></div></div><p>The development of complex distributed software architectures
demands the implementation of a mechanism that is suitable to take
advantage of system resources at runtime. A promising solution that
is more appropriate to address this issue is the introduction of an
event-based mechanism in Linux. Such mechanisms enable a real
cooperation between the operating system and the applications. They
provide components able to register for events that can be
asynchronously notified later, through the execution of
handlers.</p><p>If we compare signal handlers and event handlers, we find the
latter more informative because they bring the data directly to the
application. Basically, an asynchronous event mechanism can be used
to implement generic user-level handlers triggered by system events
or to implement periodic monitoring components, like timers. The
first case is particularly interesting if an application doesn't
know when an event occurs. When receiving events asynchronously,
the application can take action without recovering all the
necessary data because it is supplied in parameters.</p><p>Some investigations already have been done regarding fast
message-passing mechanisms, which are based on the same principles
as asynchronous events. For example, active messages (see
Resources) execute asynchronously on the stack of the receiver
process. In pop-up threads, a thread of execution is created for
every handler, and in single-threaded upcalls, a dedicated thread
is created on each processor. AEM is an emerging mechanism that
offers a native environment for the development of applications
requiring real asynchrony. For example, we used AEM to implement a
native asynchronous socket interface for TCP. In AEM, the choice is
made at registration time to define a handler that is executed on
either the current execution task or a new thread of execution.
Some other research projects have proposed similar solutions to
improve web server capabilities under high load (see &ldquo;A Scalable
and Explicit Event Delivery Mechanism for UNIX&rdquo;,
Resources).</p><p>The main benefit of the event paradigm is the integration of
event handling and thread management in the same mechanism.
Concretely, it gives full control to resource consumption.</p><p>Performance is really a goal for event-based mechanisms.
Decoupling event management from the application permits increased
locality by taking advantage of different memory allocation schemes
or influencing the scheduler decision. For example, soft real-time
responsiveness is ensured by enforcing process priorities depending
on pending events.</p><p>This emerging paradigm provides a simpler and more natural
programming style compared to the complexity offered by
multithreaded architectures. It proves its efficiency for the
development of multilayer software architectures, where each layer
provides a service to the upper layer. This type of architecture is
quite common for distributed applications.</p><p>Figure 2 illustrates a typical distributed application based
on an event-driven model. It is composed of many software
components, and a process represents one layer of the application.
In distributed applications, a lot of local and remote
communications are engaged either at the same level or at a
different level.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6777f2.large.jpg"><img src="6777f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A multilayer distributed application designed with an
event-based model running on two processors. Each layer is
single-threaded, and the communication between application
components is either synchronous (plain lines) or asynchronous
(dashed lines).
</p></div></div><p>In many situations such applications have to provide services
that must operate worldwide with high performance. It is essential
that these applications take advantage of hardware resources and
scale linearly with respect to the platform's capabilities.</p><p>The design of this software must ensure that no deadlock or
race condition is possible between the components. The impact of
such design flaws on system integrity can be catastrophic. This
situation is difficult to solve when using a multithreaded
approach, because it is hard to detect and correct due to the high
number of possible configurations. An event-based mechanism reduces
the chance of introducing points of failure by controlling the
number of threads started asynchronously. It is easier to guarantee
atomicity of handler executions, because the mechanism is kept in
the kernel.</p><p>System resources are limited, and the number of processes
that can be started is always limited. At registration time, the
alternative is given to choose the type of handler to execute. This
permits the production of more robust applications as the load
increases. The main advantage for applications is the possibility
to mix sequential code and asynchronous code. It then is possible
to design applications that exploit capabilities of both
strategies.</p><p>An event-based framework offers operators dynamic
reconfiguration with minimum impact on the system uptime. Hardware
hot swap and dynamic software upgrade must be possible without
restarting the system. Distributed applications are built from a
large number of interacting components, and upgrading such software
is a critical operation.</p><p>Telecom platforms require 99.999% uptime for all services.
The services cannot be stopped during maintenance operations, as
this would impact other service platforms and subscriber requests
connected to it. Software upgrades must be performed gradually.
Event-based mechanisms introduce the potential for such capability
to distributed applications. As we can see in Figure 2, there are
no direct dependencies between software layers if communication is
performed asynchronously. It then is possible to replace some of
the application parts without major disturbance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b3898"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>An event-based mechanism provides a new programming model
that offers software developers unique and powerful support for
asynchronous execution of processes. Of course, it radically
differs from the sequential programming styles we are used to but
offers a design framework better structured for software
development. It also simplifies the integration and the
interoperability of complex software components.</p><p>The strength of such a mechanism is its ability to combine
synchronous code and asynchronous code in the same application&mdash;or
even mix these two types of models within the same code routine.
With this hybrid approach, it is possible to take advantage of
their respective capabilities depending on the situation. This
model is especially favorable for the development of secure
software and for the long-term maintenance of mission-critical
applications.</p><p>In a future article, we will show how AEM has been
implemented to provide this support in the Linux kernel and how to
use it for software development.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12ba580.0x13b3a50"></a>Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>The Open Systems Lab for reviewing and approving the
