Netscape. When I try to run the executable I get an error message
saying I can't run the binary. &mdash;Manny Duarte</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206d580.0x21651e8"></a>No MkLinux Binary</h2></div></div><p>As far as I know, Netscape does not support MKLinux. The

and kernel 2.0.18 and pppd 2.2.0 on a local machine to connect to
the remote machine by modem. When the modem drops carrier (due to
line noise, etc.) the remote pppd process remains active,
preventing getty accepting any more connections until pppd is
killed.</p><p>Is it possible to have the remote pppd terminate
  automatically when the modem drops the carrier?  &mdash;Eskinder
Mesfin</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206d580.0x2165450"></a>Running pppd Manually</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >modem</b> option does exactly that,
assuming that your modem is set up to have the DCD signal follow
the carrier state and that your cables pass all of the relevant
signals through to the serial port. Most modems will operate DCD in
the desired mode if you include AT&amp;C1 in the init
string.</p><p>However, if you are manually running pppd on the remote
machine after logging in to a shell, there is a caveat. In that
case you need to <b  >exec</b> pppd rather than simply
running it.</p><p>If you just run pppd from the command line, the shell, rather
than the pppd process, will get the SIGHUP signal when you hang up.
The shell will terminate but leave the pppd daemon running.
Instead, do <b  >exec pppd</b>. This will replace the
running shell with pppd so that the hang-up signal will work
correctly. &mdash;Bob Hauck, Wasatch Communications

X-terminals. I would like to automate the addressing of these boxes
through RARP, preferably. I have had little trouble learning how to
make a Linux box answer RARP queries, but I can't seem to make it
generate one. Any help you could offer would be
appreciated. &mdash;George</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206d580.0x2165818"></a>Enabling RARP</h2></div></div><p>The kernel can do it. You can boot a kernel, have it generate
a RARP request, and then use the machine that answers as an NFS
server. It can do the same using the BOOTP protocol as well. These
options must be enabled during the <b  >make config</b>
of the kernel.</p><p>I suspect what you want is something like what a Sun
workstation does, which is to get a kernel from the network
starting with a RARP request. That kind of thing can be done only
with special ROMs available only for certain Ethernet cards. You
can likely find information at http://sunsite.unc.edu/linux. I
recommend using small hard disks or booting a kernel from floppy to
an NFS server. It is much easier to work with. &mdash;Donnie Barnes, Red
Hat Software redhat@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206d580.0x21659d0"></a>Plug and Play Modems</h2></div></div><p>I used Windows 95 before Linux; that's why I got a plug and
play modem. It works with Windows 95 but it does not work in Linux.
Why? &mdash;Stou Sandalski</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x206d580.0x2165ad8"></a>Two Types of Plug and Play</h2></div></div><p>There are two different types of internal modems that fall
into the plug and play category. The first is a standard modem that
is simply configured at boot time to determine what COM port it
will provide. The second is called a WinModem.</p><p>A WinModem does not have a UART, which is what makes a normal
serial port tick. Instead, they knock down the price of the modem
by $10-$20 and eliminate this normally necessary component of any
serial port or modem. It is replaced with a software driver that
emulates the UART's functionality.</p><p>If you have, or think you have, such a modem, your only hope
would be to ask the manufacturer whether they support Linux for
that modem. If not, the modem cannot be used under Linux. If you do
not have a WinModem, you should be fine, provided you set the modem
up correctly.</p><p>No two modems are identical. Your best bet is to consult the
manufacturer. In most cases, if you do not have a product that will
work under Linux, they will provide an upgrade at a very low
cost.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technical Services

try to change their password:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

your passwd binary doesn't have the right permissions, or you are
still using your old non-shadow passwd binary.</p><p>In order for passwd to make changes to the passwd file, it
must be suid root. To check this, try doing <b  >ls -l `which
passwd`</b>. It should print something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
-r-s--x--x   1 root     bin          3152 May  4  1994 /usr/bin/passwd
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The important things are the <b>s</b>
in the first column and the <b>root</b> in the third
column. If you don't see the <b>s</b>, do a
<b>chmod u+s `which passwd`</b> as root. If the file
isn't owned by root (the <b>root</b> in the third
column), do <b>chown root `which
passwd`</b>.</em></span>
</p><p>Before you do all of that though, double check that what you
are running really is the binary that shadow-ina-box installed. Do
<b  >which passwd</b> and make sure that's the right
passwd binary.  &mdash;Steven Pritchard, Southern Illinois Linux Users

text files I cannot control the font size, and lines are cut off at
the end. Is there any utility that will help me convert a text file
to PostScript in any font size, because I have no problem printing

options to control the font, paper size, lines per page, number of
copies, and so forth.</p><p>You might want to look into the magicfilter utility. This is
a nifty little program that allows you to transparently print
almost any kind of file to any reasonable printer. It installs as a
print filter and uses some heuristics to determine the file type
and work accordingly. I got my copy from Sunsite. &mdash;Bob Hauck,
