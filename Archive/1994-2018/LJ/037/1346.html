    For all the newbies out there who have just acquired their first
    computer,
    here's the map for finding your way around the many paths inside it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c9580.0x22c1450"></a>Starting at Home</h2></div></div><p>After logging in, type <b  >pwd</b> at your Linux
prompt, and you will see something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/home/williams
</pre><p>This is a path; in this case, the path for my home directory.
A directory is where files are kept. They can also contain other
directories. The path /home/williams is shorthand for &ldquo;The
directory williams which is in the directory home, local, which is
in the root directory of the file system.&rdquo; Each word between /
characters is a name; what it names is a directory. The pwd command
reported /home/williams to me, because it was my &ldquo;Present Working
Directory,&rdquo; more commonly known as the current or default
directory.
</p><p>The current directory is a simple idea with many faces.
Immediately after logging in, it is your home directory. Later, it
could be any directory on your file system. Your current directory
is really that of your shell. Other processes have their own, which
change independently. A single process with multiple sub-windows
may even maintain a current directory for each.</p><p>It is useful to be aware that a command-line user will say
&ldquo;I am in /etc/skel&rdquo;, while a graphical interface user of the same
system would report that /etc/skel is &ldquo;open&rdquo;. Both mean the same
thing. The current directory is the assumed target of your commands
and any files requested. Paths let you refer to other directories.
Unfortunately, learning to use them can be needlessly painful due
to the historical choice of nomenclature.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c9580.0x22c1710"></a>Puzzling Nomenclature</h2></div></div><p>Nomenclature describes how things are named. The / symbol, in
path names, suffers from a nomenclature quirk known as overloading,
which means it can be correctly interpreted in more than one
way.</p><p>If a path begins with /, the meaning is &ldquo;the root&rdquo;. The
root is itself a directory. [Note that /, meaning the root
directory of the file system, should not be confused with /root, a
directory in the / directory&mdash;Ed] Think of it as the boss
directory which isn't contained by any other. Beginners often fail
to &ldquo;see&rdquo; root at all, because the visual impact of a leading / is
small. This is a serious error. A / between two directory names,
after root, merely separates them. The / is not a directory&mdash;it is
just a delimiter. Try this simple test to see if you've got it. How
many directories are there in /home/williams?</p><p>The answer is three, not two. The two most first-year
students in my course get are /home and /home/williams. About a
quarter every term fail to count the root itself. If we step beyond
paths to files, the nomenclature becomes ambiguous. No matter how
closely we inspect /home/williams/foo, we cannot deduce whether foo
is a file or a directory. If the name were /home/williams/foo.txt,
we might believe foo.txt is a file, but it is possible for
directories to have extensions, and common for files to omit
them.</p><p>What do the following two examples tell you about the names
<span   class="emphasis"><em>lists</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>weba</em></span>? (The cd
[Change Directory] command resets your current directory.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Example 1
$ cd /home/lynda/lists
$ pwd
/home/lynda/lists
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
Example 2
$ cd /home/lynda/weba
bash: /home/lynda/weba: Not a directory
$ pwd
/home/ftp/pub/weba
</pre><p>You should be able to deduce that <span   class="emphasis"><em>lists</em></span>
is a directory, but <span   class="emphasis"><em>weba</em></span> isn't. Of course,
there are plenty of ways, starting with past experience, to resolve
ambiguity. The <b  >file</b> command is another, as are
the <b  >-F</b> and <b  >-l</b> options for the
<b  >ls</b> command.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c9580.0x22c1ce8"></a>Relative paths</h2></div></div><p>So far, all my paths have begun with the root. Path names
which begin this way have the same meaning no matter what the
current directory is. They are called
<span   class="bold"><b>absolute</b></span> paths. For example, the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /home/ftp/pub/weba
</pre><p>will make /home/ftp/pub/weba my new current directory
regardless of the existing one. What would the command below
achieve?
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd weba
</pre>


Any reference to a file or directory which does not begin with a
slash (/) is relative. This begs the question &ldquo;relative to what?&rdquo;
Relative to the current directory. The command above, therefore,
will work as desired only if my current directory is already
/home/ftp/pub. Consider the following attempts to use relative
paths to change directories. The prompt has changed to show the
current directory before the $ symbol, and I have taken liberties
with spacing to enhance readability.
<pre     class="programlisting">
Example 1 (success)
/home $ cd ftp/pub
/home/ftp/pub $
Example 2 (failure)
/home $ cd pub
bash: pub: No such file or directory
/home $
example 3 (failure)
/home $ cd /ftp/pub
bash: /ftp/pub: No such file or directory
/home $
example 4 (success)
/home $ cd ..
/ $
</pre>


Relative paths are just absolute paths with the current directory
assumed as a prefix. They are more common than absolute ones, as we
tend to work out of the directory of greatest interest to us at the
moment. Note, however, that it is wrong to start one with a /, as
in example 3, because doing so makes the path absolute. Sticklers
for syntax will note we lose a delimiter / in the bargain.
</p><p>Two special components in building relative paths, are . and
.. which stand for &ldquo;this directory&rdquo; and &ldquo;the directory
containing this directory &rdquo;, respectively. You can use them alone,
as in example 4, or with other components as in this fairly typical
example of backing up and going forward to a different
directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/home/ftp $     cd ../williams
/home/williams $
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21c9580.0x22c2058"></a>Building with Paths</h2></div></div><p>Confidence in using paths helps with a surprising variety of
more complex topics. The environment variable $PATH is a list of
ordinary paths separated by colons. The shell uses it to search for
program files to execute. Many programs use special variables to
establish the base path for their operations; it is useful to know
how to construct a path when one is called for as a command
parameter.</p><p>We saw how paths feature in the absolute names of files. They
also appear in URLs (Uniform Resource Locators, commonly associated
with the World Wide Web). Paths may be one of the first things you
learn, but their applications are endless.</p></div></div>
