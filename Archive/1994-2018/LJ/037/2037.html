    While running Linux on a PS/2 is not the usual choice, it is
    getting easier.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2764580.0x285c500"></a></h2></div></div><p>The PS/2 line historically has not been
able to run Linux due to the Microchannel (MCA) Bus used in it.
Technical specifications were difficult to get from IBM. There has
been support available to run Linux on MCA machines since about
1994, but it was difficult to install and required much patching by
the user. That situation has changed, and MCA machines are
relatively easy to install. Make no mistake, though, if you plan to
run Linux on your PS/2, you are still in for a challenge.
</p><p>Supported hardware for MCA machines includes 3Com and SMC-WD
Ethernet cards, IBM token ring cards, many SCSI cards and various
other cards. Most lower-end PS/2s have ESDI drive controllers,
which are not supported in the standard Linux kernel. Also, bus
differences require the kernel to do other timing-related functions
not necessary on either an ISA or a PCI bus.</p><p>This article gives fairly detailed instructions on installing
Slackware on a PS/2 with an ESDI drive. It was tested on my 55SX
with 4MB of RAM and a 60MB hard drive. The Slackware CD was NFS
mounted from another machine through an SMC Ethernet card.</p><p>Note, this would probably not be a good first installation
for anyone. It assumes familiarity with Slackware, and some steps
normally performed by the the setup program must be done
manually.</p><p>First, export the Slackware directories.</p><p>Before starting, as with any normal Slackware installation,
you will need a boot disk, a root disk and one more disk with
device files, a modified fdisk and a modified LILO. These files are
available at ftp://glycerine.cetmm.uni.edu/pub/slackware/.</p><p>Begin by downloading ps2-boot.gz, color.gz and
esdi_slack.tgz. ps2-boot and color must be decompressed; otherwise,
you will probably get some errors on the boot. Next:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat ps2-boot &gt;/dev/fd0
</pre><p>Then, switch disks:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat color&gt;/dev/fd0
</pre>


Then, switch disks:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat esdi_slack.tgz &gt;/dev/fd0
</pre>


Be sure to label these disks.
</p><p>Drive geometry detection does not always work, so you'll need
to know your cylinders, heads and sectors. Below is a table for IBM
drives.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
size    command line
30 MB
60 MB   ed=58,64,32
</pre><p>Insert the Boot disk and turn on your machine. When you get
to the LILO prompt enter <b  >ramdisk ed=58</b> (or 64 or
32&mdash;choose appropriate geometry). Watch the kernel messages go by
to see if your hardware was properly detected. Your machine may
seem to hang while resetting the ESDI drive, but it can take up to
15 seconds. Eventually, you will get a login prompt. Log in as
root. Run <b  >fdisk /dev/eda</b> (the first ESDI
device). Delete all the partitions on the drive. Now you will need
to make a root partition and a swap partition. For the 60MB drive,
I recommend 50MB for the root and 8 for the swap partition. To set
up the partitions, pick: new partition, primary partition, 1st
primary partition, start at cylinder 1, end at cylinder 50. This is
your root. Now pick: new again, primary partition, 2nd primary
partition, start at cylinder 51, and end at cylinder 58. Also
select &ldquo;change the type of partition 2 to 82 (Linux Swap)&rdquo;. Print
the partition table to make sure there are no obvious problems.
Check how many blocks are in the swap partition, because you will
need that information later. With the numbers above it should be
8192. Go ahead and write it to disk.
</p><p>If your machine is like mine, it doesn't have a lot of RAM
installed. In order to run the setup program you will need to
activate the swap partition. To do that, run <b  >mkswap
/dev/eda2</b> (number of blocks). After some disk activity,
run <b  >swapon /dev/eda2</b>. Now your machine is ready
for the setup program.</p><p>Run setup, the Slackware install program. Choose to add a
swap partition. It will find the /dev/eda2 partition itself. Be
sure to pick &ldquo;no&rdquo; when asked to run mkswap or swapon. Running
these twice will cause problems. Now select the target device. Once
/dev/eda1 is located, you will need to format this partition.
Accept the defaults you are given. After a while, you will be asked
about installation media. I have chosen NFS, because I am allergic
to swapping floppies, but you can try it if you want.</p><p>In order to do an NFS installation, you will need an IP
address for your machine and the machine with the Slackware disks
on it. You will also need to know where the files are located on
the mount. If you have mounted a CD containing Slackware on /cdrom
with the disks in distributions/slackware, you would export the
/cdrom/distributions/slackware directory. In the event you don't
have a CD, look forward to downloading. I recommend installing the
A and N series for now. It is unnecessary to install any kernels or
source, since they won't run on this machine. Go take a break while
the installation program is running&mdash;brag to your friends about
what you are doing, have a pop, etc.</p><p>When that step is completed, you are asked to install LILO.
Do not do this yet. Follow the normal steps until you are asked if
you want to exit. Go ahead. The setup program does not correctly
set up the /etc/fstab and /etc/lilo.conf files, so you need to do
that yourself. Printed below are the proper commands to type at the
shell prompt. Note the append line is the one you first typed with
the boot disk.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;/mnt/etc/lilo.conf
        append="ed=cyl,head,sec"
        boot=/dev/eda
        vga=normal
        ramdisk=0
        timeout=50
        prompt
        image=/vmlinuz
                root=/dev/eda1
                label=linux
                read-only
EOF
</pre><p>Mount the boot disk you used to start the machine. You can
use the /cdrom mount point, like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mount /dev/fd0 /cdrom
</pre>


Copy the kernel from the floppy disk to the hard drive:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp /cdrom/vmlinuz /mnt/vmlinuz
</pre>


The LILO installed by setup does not recognize the major device
number 36 that the ESDI drives use, so at this point, get out the
disk with esdi_slack.tar.gz on it, put it in the floppy drive and
type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /mnt
tar zxvf /dev/fd0
</pre>


You will get some error messages, but ignore them. To install LILO,
type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
lilo -r /mnt -C /etc/lilo.conf
</pre>


The arguments tell LILO the disk with the configuration is mounted
at /mnt.
</p><p>The file system table, /etc/fstab, is still not set up
correctly, so you will also need to execute:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt;/mnt/etc/fstab
/dev/eda1       /       ext2    defaults 1 1
/dev/eda2       none    swap    swap    0 0
none            /proc   proc    defaults 0 0
EOF
</pre><p>At this point the system is ready to be rebooted. Be sure to
unmount the floppy and press <b  >CTRL-ALT-DEL</b>. If
the machine does not reboot after about a minute, you will need to
cycle the power yourself. Be patient with your system. The ESDI
drive is pretty slow. The system should reboot into LILO and start
up Linux.
</p><p>This is still not an exact science. You may have troubles
with the partitioning depending on how the drive was formatted
before. I've found installing DOS on it will usually make the drive
conform to the cylinders, heads and sectors you enter on the append
line instead of the physical geometry.</p><p><a href="2037s1.html" target="_self">References</a></p></div></div>
