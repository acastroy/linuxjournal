    Learn how to block mail your mail

How can I configure Netscape and/or CND1.0 to bounce the person's
mail back to them?  &mdash;Mitch, Mobile, Alabama</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x18c7450"></a>And the Answer Is...</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>I'd use procmail, a little programming language
written specifically for processing mail. CND uses procmail as the
&ldquo;local delivery agent&rdquo; by default. This means that sendmail
passes any mail for a local account to procmail, and then lets
procmail do the final delivery to your mail box,
/var/spool/mail/</em></span>your_login_name. At the same time,
procmail checks for a .procmailrc file in your home directory, and
does some ownership and permissions checks on it for you.</p><p>The author of a .procmailrc file can specify a variety of
settings and clauses which are called &ldquo;recipes&rdquo;, and can also
modularize the file by using a variety of INCLUDE directives.
Here's a simple example that should get you started:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:0 hr
* ^From.*spammer.you.despise@spamhaven.com
* !^FROM_MAILER
* !^FROM_DAEMON
* !^X-Loop: ${USERNAME}i@`hostname`"
| (formail -r -A"X-Loop:
${USERNAME}@`hostname`" \
-A"Precedence: junk";\
   echo "Your mail is not welcome here."\
   echo "Please don't mail me again."\
   echo\
   cat ~/your.signature.or.flame
)
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The <b>:0</b> marks this as a new
recipe&mdash;each new recipe starts with this line. The
<b>h</b> and the <b>r</b> on that line are
flags tell procmail which parts of the message to hand to your
action line (i.e., the one that starts with a pipe, |).</em></span>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >h</b> says: &ldquo;Give me the
header.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p><b  >r</b> says: &ldquo;Treat the incoming
data as raw.&rdquo;</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>The <b  >r</b> flag is given to prevent your
response from failing if the sender has failed to put a blank line
at the end of his message.</p><p>The following four &ldquo;star&rdquo; lines in the script are
conditions. The first specifies that the header will show that the
message is &ldquo;from&rdquo; your spammer, that is, your unwanted sender.
This address will exactly match any &ldquo;from&rdquo; or &ldquo;From:&rdquo; line that
contains your target e-mail address. The next two lines of the
script ensure that you don't respond to daemons and mailers
(mailing lists). The last * line, which you should fill in with
your user name and host name, ensures that your don't respond to
your own response. Those three conditions are included to protect
your script from being tricked into undesirable actions. Consider
them to be the minimum overhead on any auto-responders that you
write.</p><p>The next line of the script, which starts with a &ldquo;|&rdquo; pipe
character, describes the action to take. In procmail there are
three types of actions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A file name specifies an <b  >mbox</b>
(elm, pine or mailx compatible) folder in which to store the
message.</p></li><li><p>A directory name specifies an <b  >mh</b>
or <b  >mmdf</b> folder for mail storage.
<b  >mh</b> and <b  >mmdf</b> use different
naming schemes for the messages in their folder directories, but
you don't need to worry about this difference unless you use one of
their mail user agents.</p></li><li><p>A <b  >!</b> (bang) line specifies an
e-mail address to which the message is to be bounced. A
<b  >|</b> (pipe) line specifies that the message is to
be filtered through a local program.</p></li></ol></div><p><b  >formail</b> is a program that comes with the
procmail package. It &ldquo;formats mail headers&rdquo;. This particular
<b  >formail</b> command formats a &ldquo;reply&rdquo;
(<b  >-r</b>) header, and adds two additional header
lines&mdash;a standard &ldquo;Precedence: junk&rdquo; line and a personal &ldquo;X-&rdquo;
line. The RFC822 spec allows you to use the X- line to embed custom
information into a header. It is also in the
<b  >formail</b> command line that you prevent an attack
by routing your response back into your own script, i.e., a mail
loop.</p><p>The <b  >echo</b> and <b  >cat</b>
statements after the <b  >formail</b> line provide output
that is appended after the mail header and that becomes the body of
your response. You can add additional echo lines or you can create
a file and use <b  >cat</b> to add it here.</p><p>If you are new to procmail (which is almost certain given
your question&mdash;auto-responders are some of the first things that
procmail users learn), you may be nervous about breaking something
and losing some of your mail. To protect yourself you will want to
start your .procmailrc with the following simple recipe:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
:0 c
fallback
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>This recipe, if it is the first recipe in the
script, appends a copy of every incoming message to a file named
<b>fallback</b> in your ~/Mail directory by default.
You can compare the contents of that folder to your inbox until you
are confident that everything is working as you expect.</em></span>
</p><p>Please read the procmail and procmailex (examples) man pages
for more details. The author, Stephen van der Berg, has also
written an automated mail list management package called SmartList
that is highly regarded among people that I know who have used it.
I like SmartList much better than Majordomo.  &mdash;Jim</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x18c8630"></a>Dealing with E-mail on a POP3 Server</h2></div></div><p>Is there any way (or any program out there) which will not
only get my e-mail from a POP3 server off of one account, but
distribute it to multiple users on my system by either the
<b  >from:</b> or <b  >subject:</b>
lines?</p><p>Perhaps popclient could get the mail and save to temp. Then a
program could go through the saved mail and say, &ldquo;Hmmm, this mail
is from johndoe@linux.org and it goes to root&mdash;then the next
message is from mike@canoe.net and it goes to Dave.&rdquo; Is there a
program that will do this?  &mdash;Moe Green, starved@ix.netcom.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x18c8840"></a>And the Answer Is...</h2></div></div><p>It is possible to write procmail scripts that can take this
sort of action for you. Although I don't recommend this approach,
I'll tell you how to do it.</p><p>The current version of popclient is called fetchmail, because
it supports IMAP and some other mail store and forward protocols.
The fetchmail default is to fetch the mail from your POP or IMAP
server and feed it to the smtpd (sendmail) on your local host. This
means that any special processing that would be done by the aliases
or .forward files (especially any processing through procmail
scripts) will be done automatically.</p><p>It is possible to override that feature and feed the messages
through a pipe or into a file. It is also possible, using procmail
or any scripting language, to parse and dispatch the file. Using
anything other than procmail would require that you know a lot
about RFC822, the standard for Internet mail headers, and about
e-mail in general.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>I wrote an article on procmail that appears in
February's</em></span> Linux Gazette, Issue 14. The gist of it is
also available on my own mail server, and can be obtained by
sending mail to info@starshine.org with a subject of
<b  >procmail</b> or <b  >mailbot</b>.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The reason I don't recommend using procmail in this
way is that it violates the intentions and design of Internet
e-mail. A better solution is to find a provider of UUCP
(Unix-to-Unix CoPy) services or at least SMTP/MX (Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol) services. UUCP is the</em></span> right way to
provide e-mail to disconnected (dial-up) hosts and networks. It was
designed and implemented over 25 years ago, and all of the mail
systems on the Internet know how to gateway to UUCP sites.</p><p>As for SMTP/MX services for disconnected hosts/networks,
there are various ways of hacking sendmail and DNS (Domain Name
Service) configurations that have been developed in the last few
years with a variety of shell scripts and custom programs to
support them. All of these methods provide essentially the same
services as mail via UUCP over TCP but do not conform to any
standard, which means that whatever you learn and configure with
one ISP probably won't work with the next one.  &mdash;Jim</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x18c8c60"></a>Security Problem</h2></div></div><p>Recently a cracker got into my Linux system on the Internet.
He didn't do a lot of damage, but I guess he did turn off system
logging, since I couldn't see what he'd done. Now I can't get it
working again. Here's what I've done so far:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>I've made sure that the syslogd program is running
using <b  >ps</b>.</p></li><li><p>I've read the syslogd.conf file to make sure it's
logging everything, and where it's going to.</p></li><li><p>I've checked permissions on the log file.</p></li><li><p>I did a <b  >kill -HUP</b> on the syslogd
process, and it writes <b  >restart</b> to the
log.</p></li><li><p><b  >logger</b> does nothing when I run
it (no log entry, no error).</p></li><li><p>All my C programs that wrote to syslog don't
anymore.</p></li></ol></div><p>Anyone have any good ideas what to do from
here?  &mdash;Jayjay@shadow.ashpool.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x1cc15e8"></a>And the Answer Is...</h2></div></div><p>I do, but they are rather too involved for me to type up
tonight. However, I highly recommend that you reinstall the OS and
all binaries from scratch whenever you think root has been
compromised on your system. I realize this is a time-consuming
proposition, but it is the only way to truly be sure.</p><p>I also recommend the program tripwire that can be found at
ftp.cs.perdue.edu in the COAST archive, and its mirrors.</p><p>Please feel free to write me at jimd@starshine.org if you
continue to have system security problems.</p><p>Sorry to take so long to respond. I've been literally swamped
all month.  &mdash;Jim</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x1cc17f8"></a>More on Security</h2></div></div><p>I found that the cracker had replaced my syslogd with a
packet sniffer. I think he had copied the syslogd code and replaced
parts of it with his sniffer. It seemed to have some functionality
but not a lot...</p><p>I also found a SUID version of bash in my /tmp directory. My
thought is this is the way he originally got root
access.  &mdash;Jay</p><p>Not too surprising. He was probably using a
<b  >rootkit</b>; however, he obviously didn't do a very
good job of covering his tracks. You should consider all passwords
for all of the systems on the local net to be compromised. Force
password changes across the board and consider installing
<b  >ssh</b> or <b  >stelnet</b>. Both are
secure, encrypted replacements to <b  >rlogin/rsh</b> and
<b  >telnet</b> respectively.</p><p>He probably got in through the &ldquo;Leshka&rdquo; sendmail bug that
allows any shell user to create a root-owned SUID shell in /tmp/ on
any system that has an SUID root copy of sendmail (version ~8.6.x
to 8.7.x ?). The bug involves sendmail's handling of ARGV[0] and
it's subsequent SIGHUP (signal to disconnect) handling. Everyone
using earlier versions of sendmail should upgrade to 8.8.3 or later
(see http://www.sendmail.org/ for details).</p><p>How important are this system and the other systems on the
same LAN segment to your business? I'd seriously consider hiring a
qualified consultant for a full day risk assessment and audit.
Unfortunately, you'll probably pay at least $125/hr for anyone
that's worth talking to, and many of the &ldquo;security consultants&rdquo;
out there are snake oil salesmen, so beware.  &mdash;Jim</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>This article was first published in Issue 14 of LinuxGazette.com,
