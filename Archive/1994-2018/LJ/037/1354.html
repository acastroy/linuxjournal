    Linux supports a very wide array of networking
    protocol, and software exists to tap into virtually any
    network server, and even become a server for non-Unix clients.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1524580.0x161c558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Today's networks are becoming
increasingly complex and diverse. Often a system administrator is
forced to face a network of more than one operating systems, and
sometimes even more than one communication protocols. Not
surprisingly, one platform that manages to adjust in these harsh
conditions is Linux. Linux supports a very wide array of networking
protocol, and software exists to tap into virtually any network
server, and even become a server for non-Unix clients. Samba
provides client/server for Windows 3.11/95/NT networks, Netatalk
takes care of Macintosh's Appletalk, and in this article I will
discuss yet another program that allows any Linux machine to become
a full-fledged Novell client.
</p><p>Novell networks are among the most popular ones in the world.
Therefore, it is no surprise that some means of interacting with
Novell servers has evolved. A typical Novell network consists of
one Novell server, usually running dedicated to Novell, and many
clients (PCs usually running DOS/Windows). Unlike NFS Unix
networks, there is a very big software difference between the
Novell server (usually running a special OS) and the clients
(usually running DOS/Windows with Novell drivers). While commercial
products exist that enable interaction between Novell and Unix
systems, ncpfs provides a powerful, easy and free way of doing
it.</p><p>ncpfs is a suite of programs created and maintained by Volker
Lendecke (lendecke@namu01.Num.Math.Uni-Goettingen.de) that let you
access a Novell server in various ways. The primary service a
Novell server provides is its files. A Novell server holds several
volumes, each usually corresponding to a hard drive or CD-ROM.
ncpfs lets you easily mount a Novell server&mdash;the directory used to
mount the server will contain a directory for each volume
accessible on that server, and in those directories will be the
actual directories and files. Note that a Novell server allows you
to see only what you have permission to see.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1524580.0x161c710"></a>How to Use NCPFS</h2></div></div><p>Get the latest version of ncpfs from:
ftp.gwdg.de:/pub/linux/misc/ncpfs or from:
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Filesystems/ncpfs. Untar it, and
compile the tools by typing <b  >make</b> and
<b  >make install</b>. Consult the README file, if you
have any problems.</p><p>ncpfs utilizes the NCP (Novell Core Protocol) protocol, which
sits on top of IPX (Internetworking Packet eXchange). First, make
sure that IPX support is available in the kernel (or as a loadable
module). Then, you must configure the IPX interface. ncpfs comes
with the Linux IPX tools, which allow you to create an IPX
interface and a route, somewhat like ifconfig and route. The
easiest way to configure your IPX system is by doing this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipx_configure --auto_interface=on \
        --auto_primary=on
</pre><p>This attempts to automatically determine everything about
your interface, and to set it as the primary one. If this doesn't
work, you will have to try to configure manually. For more
information consult the man pages for ipx_configure, ipx_interface,
ipx_internal_net and ipx_route. Now you are ready to run ncpfs
utilities.
</p><p>All the ncpfs tools work in a similar fashion. Since each
operation requires accessing a Novell server, almost each command
execution requires that three things be supplied: the server name,
the user name and the password. There are two ways to do so:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Use command-line parameters:
<b  >&lt;command&gt; -S &lt;server name&gt; -U &lt;user
name&gt; -P &lt;password&gt;</b>. This is usually a tiresome
method since EVERY command needs to have these three switches fed
to it.</p></li><li><p>The file ~/.nwclient may contain information about
servers. Each line may contain information in the following syntax:
<b  >&lt;server_name&gt;/&lt;user_name&gt;
&lt;password&gt;</b></p></li></ol></div><p>If you specify the <b  >-S</b> command-line
parameter, the program will automatically get the user name and
password from the appropriate line of this file. If not, it will
use the first line.
</p><p>To cut straight to the interesting stuff, in order to mount a
Novell server, simply type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ncpmount &lt;mount_point&gt;
</pre><p>Again, add switches for the server, user and password or use
~/.nwclient.
</p><p>Your mount point will contain a directory for each volume,
containing the actual files, in the Novell server.
<b  >ncpmount</b> also provides many options to control
the mounting, such as the UID and GID of the file hierarchy.
Consult ncpmount.8 for more details. Note that a Novell server can
be mounted several times from the same computer. Note also that
<b  >ncpmount</b> and <b  >ncpumount</b> do NOT
have to be setuid, which enables any normal user to mount their
accounts on a Novell server, opening yet more possibilities for
ncpfs application in the real world. For example, to access the
file \LOGIN\LOGIN.EXE on volume SYS, on the Novell server MYSERV on
/mnt, as the user <b  >supervisor</b> with the password
<b  >12345</b> (let's hope there aren't many of these out
there), execute:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ncpmount -S MYSERV -U supervisor -P 12345 /mnt
</pre><p>OR have the following line in ~/.nwclient:
<pre     class="programlisting">
MYSERV/supervisor 12345
</pre>


and execute:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ncpmount /mnt
</pre>


Once the Novell server is mounted, the file LOGIN.EXE will be
represented as /mnt/sys/login/login.exe.
</p><p>In order to print to a Novell server, simply execute:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nprint -q &lt;queue_name&gt; &lt;file&gt;
</pre><p>This will contact the specified printer queue on the server
and send it <b  >&lt;file&gt;</b> as a print job. See
nprint.1 for more details. Note that ncpfs also provides a print
server, allowing Linux to connect to a Novell server's queues and
transfer jobs to the Linux printing system; see pserver.1 for more
information.
</p><p>Another important functionality provided by ncpfs is direct
access to the bindery. The bindery is the database where a Novell
server keeps all information about users, groups, and just about
everything else. Unfortunately, the bindery can normally be
accessed only by using tools provided by Novell. While these tools
are usually very colorful and user-friendly, when it comes to
manipulating hundreds of users and groups they don't pack the
punch. In Unix this problem is solved by providing direct access to
the database&mdash;/etc/passwd, for example, and using general-purpose
tools such as sed, awk and perl. ncpfs provides tools to access the
bindery and modify it, allowing the savvy system administrator to
write flexible shellscripts to modify a Novell server's bindery.
So, for example, if you wish to change every single user's name so
that the third letter is x, you can do so quite easily. This
ability means that even if you don't need to access a Novell server
from a Linux machine you might still find a use for ncpfs for
administrative purposes.</p><p>The tools nwbocreate, nwbols, nwboprops and nwborm allow you
to manipulate bindery objects (such as users, groups, print queues,
etc.); the tools nwbpadd, nwbpcreate, nwbprm, nwbpset and nwbpvalue
will change the properties of objects. These base-functionality
programs open up endless possibilities for Novell management
utilities for Linux, even more diverse than the ones that exist for
DOS/Windows, since no programming libraries are normally provided
with Novell Netware. See their man pages for additional
information.</p><p>Some more nifty tools provided by ncpfs are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>nwrights</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>nwgrant</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>nwrevoke</b></span> allow the modification of

Israel (www.leyada.jlm.k12.il) decided to go on-line about one year
ago. We had a 60-computer Novell network already up and running,
and we dedicated one DX4-100 for the job of Internet server.
However, in many cases students and teachers wanted (or were
required) to write their own WWW pages. At first, that person would
write a page, and I would copy it to the Internet server manually.
This is a very clumsy solution that worked only at first, and it
doesn't allow the user to edit their pages.</p><p>At some point I found ncpfs. It was a very experimental
project then, but it did most of what I needed it to do. Right now,
our Novell server (freud.leyada.jlm.k12.il) is always mounted by
our Linux Internet server (www.leyada.jlm.k12.il) as /novell (a
cron script checks that this is so, and mounts the server if not).
The httpd web server automatically looks for pages in a specific
directory inside the Novell hierarchy, which solves the problem.
This directory, say G:\WWW, contains our entire home page. When a
student wishes to create a home page, he requests that a directory
be opened for him under that directory, say G:\WWW\HOME\JOE. He
receives Novell write permission to that directory, and is able to
edit HTML files with his favorite web editor. This technique also
allows everyone to use DOS and Windows to edit HTML files, which in
our case is what the Novell clients run. Therefore, a user edits an
HTML file through Windows and checks it with Netscape, while the
page is LIVE, since the Linux machine mounts the Novell
server.</p></div></div>
