question is, &ldquo;Why did the editor/s never ensure that the
abbreviation was defined at least once in the magazine?&rdquo; This lack
of definition of acronyms is very annoying to me since the computer
world is so chock full of acronyms. Acronyms in this environment
are also very context-sensitive&mdash;so much so that defining terms
like this should be mandatory in <span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> article
published anywhere. &mdash;Mac Bowles Senior Software Engineer Lockheed
Martin Astronautics kbowles@claven.mmc.den.com</p><p>First, CGI stands for Common Gateway Interface. Second, I
agree that tossing acronyms around without defining them is
annoying, and plan to be more careful in the future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e1580.0x27d9450"></a>Linux in Schools</h2></div></div><p>I have read the letter to <i  >Linux Journal</i>
from Mr. Jack McGregor, who is pushing usage of dumb terminals for
schools (low cost). I am a Linux consultant. However, I am not
pushing dumb terminals, but Linux-based X terminals using old 386
and 486 PCs. My experience with low end 486s demonstrates that
indeed they are very fast and fun to use to operate major desktop
packages (WordPerfect, Netscape, Applixware and StarOffice are a
few I have tried). They can also run games (e.g., Doom).</p><p>I have customers who have turned to this solution not to save
money but to gain raw speed. For example, one is using a dual
Pentium Pro 200MHz with 192MB of RAM as a server for 10 users (C++
developers). Everything is in RAM all the time for all users. This
beats any network when it comes to loading software or searching
through directories and so on. In one case, the speedup they are
getting by sharing the same server instead of the more standard
Windows-to-server relation is close to a factor of 10.</p><p>While X is an old technology for some, Linux is making it
into a revolution because of its low cost. &mdash;Jacques

kernel) for over a year. I wanted to upgrade to the 2.0 kernel, and
decided that a new CD-ROM distribution would be convenient. After
reading about Red Hat 4.0 in the <i  >LJ</i> Readers'
Choice Awards and an <span   class="emphasis"><em>InfoWorld</em></span> review that
selected Red Hat 4.0 as one of the two best operating system
releases in 1996 (the other was NT workstation), I decided to
order.</p><p>My installations (about a dozen trials) were plagued with
random segmentation faults, stack-dumps and reboots. The Red Hat
support team responded as advertised and suggested hardware (i.e.,
CPU, RAM, cache, motherboard) was producing my problems. The Red
Hat technician pointed me toward RAM or cache because I just had a
brand-new motherboard installed, and he presumed that the
motherboard or the brand-new cache was not a problem. Finally, the
Red Hat technician suggested that:</p><p>&ldquo;Red Hat is sometimes not able to run (for unknown reasons)
on some hardware that <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> run Slackware.&rdquo;
(E-mail from Red Hat support.)</p><p>I had my RAM diagnosed by a local computer repair shop that
has a hardware technician who is a also Linux guru. No problems
were reported with the RAM, but the technician could not duplicate
my installation symptoms.</p><p>Finally, a bit dazed and still suspecting the RAM, I
purchased some extra RAM. I tried the installation one last time,
using only the new RAM&mdash;I still could not successfully install Red
Hat 4.0. Alas, I am back to the Slackware 3.0 and out $60 for the
Red Hat.</p><p>I am truly disappointed that I cannot get Red Hat 4.0
working. It seems Red Hat has so much to offer new Linux users in
terms of configuration, installation, etc. But, as Microsoft can
attest, it will be difficult for any commercial distribution to
support every PC configuration. My PC is the evidence.</p><p>All is not lost, though. As the web master for our software
manufacturing firm, I take care of the Intranet Web pages. We need
a new internal web server, and I am adamant that it runs on a Linux
box. Maybe the Red Hat distribution can foot this bill. For my PC
though, I am sticking with Slackware. &mdash;Jeffery C. Cann Software

the shelves of local software stores (<i  >LJ</i>
February 1997). Perhaps he's just living in a technologically
repressed area. I just checked my nearest shopping-mall computer
store here in Quebec City: They have the 6-CD InfoMagic package and
the 4-CD Walnut Creek distribution, both up to date and
competitively priced. A nearby store has several copies of two
books on Linux. The distribution mechanisms must exist&mdash;encourage
local dealers to use them. &mdash;Don Galbraith dsg@clic.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26e1580.0x27d9be0"></a>On-line Linux Users Group</h2></div></div><p>Hi. I have been a long time reader of <i  >LJ</i>

many in the Linux community. Now, my friends on the Net and I have
also done something as a contribution to Linux which I thought
would be interesting to you and helpful to your readers. This is to
create an On-Line Linux Users Group for people interested in

The NFS hosts are running SunOS 4.1.4 and Solaris. I found the
suggestion that amd is relatively bug free incorrect. In the first
few days of using it I found two important bugs. The first is that
it confused the node name of one machine with the IP address of
another machine. That is, I found directories from one machine
under the name of the other in the /net directory. The second bug I
have experienced several times. If a directory is unmounted, amd
doesn't seem to know how to mount it for several minutes
afterwards. Both of these bugs result in directories
disappearing&mdash;including my home directory. It can make it very hard
to justify using Linux when these major type problems exist.</p><p>As you can see, this is a big issue for me. I have seen
several postings in dejanews referring to other problems with amd.
I would like to see more support, but up to this point I have found
very little in the way of answers to most questions about amd.
Thanks for the article anyway. &mdash;David

today. My work involves C, Korn shell and Perl. I am convinced that
Perl is a marvelous language. Mr. Wall's article supports
that.</p><p>I understand the notion of creativity as a function of a
large palette (...there's more than one way....) and the theory
that &ldquo;form follows function&rdquo;. My conclusion is that Perl is
unacceptable as a development tool because I cannot support it. It
takes too long to discover (glean, figure out, guess at, puzzle
out) which of the myriad possible methods was used by the original
developer&mdash;even when that was me. I will continue to write Perl for
fun and use more documentable, supportable languages for important
systems.</p><p>I also wonder if Mr. Wall's writing would be a little more
effective if he didn't attempt to be funny in every paragraph. He
is the linguistic equivalent of the aggressive graphics that
prevent many people from being able to read that very trendy San
Francisco- based magazine on pop-wired culture. &mdash;Brandon

algorithms for deciding whether a point is in a polygon in your
March issue (&ldquo;A Point about Polygons&rdquo;). It is too bad that Bob
wasn't familiar with the algorithm used for this in the WN web
server (see http://hopf.math.nwu.edu/), as it has some interesting
similarities and differences when compared to the algorithm he
describes. Like Stein's it uses integer (actually long int)
arithmetic rather than floating point.</p><p>I first used this algorithm in a version of WN released in
July of 1995. As with Stein's algorithm we start by translating, so
the test point is at the origin. Instead of counting the parity
(evenness or oddness) of the number of crossings with the positive
Y-axis, the actual signed number of crossings is counted (I used
the positive X-axis instead of the Y-axis, but that is immaterial).
More precisely, the algorithm counts +2 if an edge crosses the
positive X-axis with positive slope and -2 if it crosses with
negative slope. If an edge <span   class="emphasis"><em>ends</em></span> on the
positive X-axis, it gets a count of only +1 or -1 depending on the
slope. If the edge lies entirely in the positive X-axis, it gets a
count of 0. If the origin (test point) is actually on any edge, we
declare that the point is in the polygon and quit. After all edges
have been counted, we declare that the test point is outside the
polygon only if the total count is zero.</p><p>The implementation in WN is about three times as long as
Stein's implementation, largely because I wanted to get all the
special cases right even if in practice they don't matter much. In
particular, if the test point is on an edge, it is always declared
in the polygon. Also polygons with only two sides or degenerate
polygons (like points) work properly.</p><p>There is one very big difference in the way the two
algorithms behave when the polygon is not simple (i.e. crosses
itself). Imagine a five-pointed star drawn in the usual way without
lifting your pencil from the paper. With the even/odd count only
points in the five triangular &ldquo;tips&rdquo; of the star will be
considered inside while points in the pentagonal central region
will be considered outside. The WN algorithm, on the other hand,
will count all these points, tips and center, as &ldquo;inside&rdquo;. This
is, in fact, the reason I chose this method rather than the
even/odd count.</p><p>The reason this difference occurs is not too difficult to
understand. Imagine the polygon is a stretched rubber band held in
place on a table with thumb tacks at each vertex. At the test point
we erect a vertical post perpendicular to the table. Now remove all
the tacks and let the rubber band contract into the post. It may
wrap around the post some number of times positively or negatively
(i.e., counter-clockwise or clockwise) or it may not be hooked on
the post at all. The even/odd algorithm is counting whether the
number of times it wraps around is even or odd, while the WN
algorithm is counting the full number.</p><p>If the polygon does not cross itself the actual number can
only be 0, +1, or -1, so the even/odd algorithm works fine. With
the five-pointed star, if the post is put in the central region,
the rubber band goes around twice, and so the algorithms give
different answers.</p><p>If anyone is interested in the WN implementation, just
download the distribution and in the file wn/image.c look for the
functions <b  >dopoly()</b> and
<b  >segment()</b>. The distribution can be found at
