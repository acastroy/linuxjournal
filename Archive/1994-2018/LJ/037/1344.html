    See how to use a mix of Tcl, Tk, and C to make image manipulation

scratch for an image processing (or manipulation) program is a
difficult task. It is necessary not only to develop an internal
data structure, but also to write the filters for reading and
writing the available graphic formats. The interface design and
implementation is also difficult, due to the need for dealing with
issues such as color allocation, quantization and so on. In this
article, we'll show you how Tcl and Tk can help you in dealing with
these problems easily. However, it should be noted that some
operations on images are computationally intensive, making the use
of Tcl prohibitively expensive. So we'll use a mixture of Tcl and
Tk with C, and get the best of both worlds.
</p><p>In <i  >Linux Journal</i> #10 (February, 1995)
Matt Welsh wrote a nice article describing a way to use Tcl/Tk as a
front end for C programs using pipes to and from a wish process.
While this method has many advantages, e.g., straightforward
implementation and memory saving when using static libraries, it
does present some limitations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>First, since your program is &ldquo;split&rdquo; into two
different processes, the sharing of resources is not an easy
task.</p></li><li><p>Second, all communication is done through the
pipes, imposing an extra burden on the system.</p></li></ul></div><p>In this article, we approach this problem using Tcl/Tk as an
extension to the core program, and show some of the advantages of
solving it in this manner.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28a6580.0x299e920"></a>A Practical Example: Let's Dither</h2></div></div><p>We'll start by writing a small program to do a special dither
(half-toning) for creating a special effect that applies only to a
selected sub-rectangle of an image.</p><p>The described technique transforms vertical strips of colored
pixels into a vertical strip of black and white pixels, where the
average intensity best approximates the original average. Also, all
black pixels are grouped in the center. (This effect has been used
in the entertainment industry for some time now.) See Figure 1. The
following sections describe the necessary steps for accomplishing
this effect.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1344f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28a6580.0x299ec38"></a>Image in Tk</h2></div></div><p>The very fabric of our program is based on the
<span   class="bold"><b>image</b></span> primitive, which first
appeared in Tk version 4.0. The idea is to create an &ldquo;image
object&rdquo; with an associated command, just like any normal
widget.</p><p>Images can be of two different types: bitmaps and photos.
While bitmaps deal only with foreground and background colors,
photos treat true-color objects, automatically quantizing for the
available number of colors in the display. Let's focus on the
&ldquo;photo&rdquo; type, which was implemented by Paul Mackerras based on
his earlier &ldquo;photo widget&rdquo;.</p><p>A command for creating an image object named &ldquo;picture&rdquo; with
the image in the file &ldquo;mickey.gif&rdquo; would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
image create photo picture -file mickey.gif
</pre><p>After its creation we can easily do some operations. For
example, to get its dimensions:
<pre     class="programlisting">
set pic_wid [image width picture]
set pic_hei [image height picture]
</pre>


You can also create a second image, and copy a section of the first
one into the second:
<pre     class="programlisting">
image create photo pic_piece
pic_piece copy picture -from 0 0
        [expr $pic_wid/2] [expr $pic_hei/2]
</pre>


During the copy you can use the Tk options
<b  >subsample</b> or <b  >zoom</b> to reduce
the image or enlarge a portion of it. The copied portion can be
placed anywhere inside the destination image.
</p><p>It is possible to specify the size of the color cube of a
given image (you can even explicitly impose it to be gray-scale),
its gamma correction and some other nifty things. Check out the
<span   class="bold"><b>photo</b></span> man page for details.</p><p>A good way to both see the image and allow some manipulation
is to treat it as a &ldquo;canvas object&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
canvas .c
pack .c
 .c create image 1 1 -anchor nw -image picture
                -tags "myimage"
</pre><p>After creation, you can draw and manipulate any canvas object
you wish just as if it were floating upon
<b  >myimage</b>. Just remember to keep the image as the
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; object, so that you'll always be able to see everything
else. This positioning can be accomplished by giving:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 .canvas lower myimage
</pre>

Programs</h2></div></div><p>Let's make a small distinction between two kinds of C-Tcl/Tk
applications: those which act like a shell (wish, for example) and
those which use the Tcl/Tk extension in a predetermined way.</p><p>If you want to create another &ldquo;instance&rdquo; of wish with some
extra commands you have created, you should read the man pages
concerning <b  >Tcl_Main</b> and
<b  >Tcl_AppInit</b>.</p><p>If your program uses Tcl/Tk only for the interface, and it is
not intended to be used in a &ldquo;shell-like&rdquo; fashion, the approach
is slightly different. I recommend you grab the nice demo program
tkHelloWorld.tar.gz (see Sidebar) to use as an example.</p><p>Basically, your program has to implement the following four
steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Initialize Tcl and Tk.</p></li><li><p>Create the Tcl commands responsible for calling
your C routines.</p></li><li><p>Ask Tcl to evaluate an &ldquo;interface description&rdquo;
file.</p></li><li><p>Let Tk control the main flow of the program.</p></li></ul></div><p>In the C code shown in Listing 1, the comments identify
exactly which of the four steps is being done.</p><p><a href="1344l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>From this point on, we wish to use C programming only for
some critical functions, since the main flow and control of our
application is handled by Tk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28a6580.0x299f9f8"></a>Calling C Functions from Tcl</h2></div></div><p>If you are interested in the myriad ways you can call a C
routine, read <span   class="emphasis"><em>TCL and the TK Toolkit</em></span> by John
K. Ousterhout, Addison-Wesley, 1994.</p><p>Essentially your C function must have a prototype like the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int
C_func_name (ClientData cd, Tcl_Interp *interp,
             int argc, char **argv);
</pre><p>and you must register it by:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Tcl_CreateCommand (interp, "Tcl_func_name",
        C_func_name, (ClientData *) NULL,
        (Tcl_CmdDeleteProc *) NULL);
</pre>


Then, whenever Tcl encounters the command
<b  >Tcl_func_name</b>, it will call your routine, which
will receive the Tcl parameters just as <b  >main</b>
receives the <b  >argc</b> and <b  >argv</b>
arguments from the shell, i.e., <b  >argc</b> will be the
number of words and <b  >argv</b> will be the &ldquo;vector of
strings&rdquo;.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28a6580.0x2d98118"></a>Passing Images Back and Forth</h2></div></div><p>We want our C routine to process an image called
<b  >image_name</b> under Tk. The immediate solution
would be to pass the color of each pixel (the photo widget has this
option) again and again until the image is complete. While this
program was running, we could go out for lunch, visit a few
friends, have dinner and see a movie. However, there is a better
way to accomplish the goal. From C, we ask Tk to take care of it.
First, we have to define:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Tk_PhotoHandle      image;
Tk_PhotoImageBlock  blimage;
</pre><p>Then call the following functions in sequence:
<pre     class="programlisting">
image = Tk_FindPhoto ("image_name");
Tk_PhotoGetImage (image, &amp;blimage);
</pre>


The image is in <b  >blimage</b>, which is a structure
defined in tk.h as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
typedef struct {
  unsigned char *pixelPtr;
  int width;
  int height;
  int pitch;
  int pixelSize;
  int offset[3];
} Tk_PhotoImageBlock;
</pre>


All color information comes in unsigned characters (values between
0 and 255). The <b  >pixelPtr</b> is the address of the
first pixel (top-left corner). The <b  >width</b> and
<b  >height</b> define the image dimensions, while
<b  >pixelSize</b> is the address difference between two
horizontally adjacent pixels, and <b  >pitch</b> is the
address difference between two vertically adjacent ones. Finally,
the <b  >offset</b> array contains the offsets from the
address of a pixel to the addresses of the bytes containing the
red, green and blue components.
</p><p>Using the above definitions allows different representations
of the image; for example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Define a point with a dimension of three bytes, one
for each color component. Then the <b  >pixelSize</b> is
3, the <b  >offset</b> 0, 1 and 2 and the
<b  >pitch</b> three times the width.</p></li><li><p>Think of the color image as three planes (images),
one for each color. Then the <b  >pixelSize</b> is 1, the
<b  >offset</b> is 0, <b  >width*height</b> and
<b  >2*width*height</b>. Finally, the
<b  >pitch</b> is equal to the width.</p></li></ul></div><p>The colors of a given pixel can be obtained with three simple
C macros:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define RED(p,x,y)  ((p)-&gt;pixelPtr[(y)*(p)-&gt;
pitch + (x)*(p)-&gt;pixelSize + (p)-&gt;offset[0]] )
#define GREEN(p,x,y) ((p)-&gt;pixelPtr[(y)*(p)-&gt;
pitch + (x)*(p)-&gt;pixelSize + (p)-&gt;offset[1]])
#define BLUE(p,x,y)  ((p)-&gt;pixelPtr[(y)*(p)-&gt;
pitch + (x)*(p)-&gt;pixelSize + (p)-&gt;offset[2]])
</pre><p>You call the macros giving the address of the block structure
explained above as the first parameter, and the x and y coordinates
(where 0,0 is the upper-left corner) of the pixel as the second and
third. For an optimized program, it would be much faster to use
address differences to determine the position of the next pixel
from the current pixel, i.e., its neighbor.

Interaction</h2></div></div><p>When Tcl/Tk calls a function in C, it can still receive
interface events, such as button presses or slider movements;
however, it cannot run the associated scripts (or C functions)
bound to these events, since for the moment the C function controls
the flow.</p><p>A good example is a mass-spring simulator, where the C
function has a loop doing the simulation and canvas drawing. It
would be wonderful to be able to change the constants during the
simulation, or even abort it before the pre-determined time. This
option is also needed in long Tcl scripts. The solution in both
cases is to use the <b  >update</b> command from time to
time in order to process user input.</p><p>From the <b  >update</b> man page:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The update command with no options is useful in
scripts where you are performing a long-running computation but you
still want the application to respond to user interactions; if you
occasionally call update, user input will be processed during the
next call to update.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28a6580.0x2d99350"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>A powerful combination is achieved by letting Tcl/Tk deal
with the interface and C with the critical tasks of a
program.</p><p>A lot of useful extra widgets can be found on the Internet
for using sound (see tkSound), moving objects and so on. The
principle for integration of these widgets is the same&mdash;you can
create a new wish-like shell, or use the new available functions
together with come extra C code of your own.</p><p>Another good package is Tix, which is included with many
Linux distributions. It adds many wonderful widgets to Tk, and has
an object-oriented approach to building new
&ldquo;mega-widgets&rdquo;.</p><p>I hope you find this article useful, and have a nice
hack.</p><p><a href="1344s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
