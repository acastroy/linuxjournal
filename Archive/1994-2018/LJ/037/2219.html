    Netscape 3.01 for Linux exists and is still not supported.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c8580.0x24c01e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Back in <i  >LJ</i> issue 20,
I wrote about how Netscape said they intended to drop Linux from
the list of supported operating systems. To most of us this
wouldn't have been a surprise as Linux has never been supported by
Netscape&mdash;only an unsupported version of Netscape has been
available for Linux.
</p><p>Well, things haven't changed much. Netscape 3.01 for Linux
exists and is still not supported. In that same article I suggested
that if we could write a complete operating system as a community
effort that we could do the same for a web browser. Then I went on
to suggest that starting with Arena, the W3C's test platform, and
building the best web browser for Linux from it was a reasonable
idea.</p><p>It probably was a reasonable idea, but it never seriously
happened. We all continue to use Netscape or Mosaic and hope for
the best. Another thing happened recently that makes me nervous:
the Mosaic 2.8 team was moved to another project, so we really are
pretty much at the Netscape or nothing stage.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c8580.0x24c03f8"></a>The Lights Come On</h2></div></div><p>I was thinking about this yesterday while reading the Linux
newsgroups looking for a possible topic for this column. The answer
was there. There was a press release from Yggdrasil Computing that
announced that they would be working on development of Arena. To
quote the announcement,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The World Wide Web Consortium has approved
Yggdrasil Computing to coordinate future development of Arena, a
powerful graphical web browser originally developed as the
Consortium's research test bed.</p></blockquote></div><p>All the work will be under the GPL, meaning that it will be
available to anyone&mdash;commercial or non-commercial. This isn't a
Linux-only effort. Yggdrasil also plans to make it available on
other Unix platforms and MS-Windows. The MS-Windows version will be
accomplished by joining forces with Pearl Software which offers an
X-Windows emulator.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23c8580.0x24c0608"></a>More Players</h2></div></div><p>I suggested this topic to Margie Richardson,
<i  >LJ</i>'s Managing Editor and also the Editor of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>, our on-line Linux magazine
(http://www.ssc.com/lg/), and she handed me information on another
effort called the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Browser Project</em></span>. I
went off web searching and found that there is another alternative
to Netscape in the making.</p><p>The first thing I found was that the project has been renamed
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mnemonic</em></span>. This is because, while Linux is
the development platform of choice, the goal is to produce a free
browser available for many different operating systems. To start,
here is the &ldquo;What is&rdquo; from their web page:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The basic goal of Mnemonic is to produce a free,
usable and maintained World Wide Web Browser for many different
operating systems. The intent is to make the browser as modular as
possible, to make it easy to add new features and to port to
different interfaces and platforms. The base browser will most
likely support HTML 3.2 and Cascading Style Sheets, with support
for things like Java and HTML Extensions being distributed as
add-on modules. Other proposed features include IPv6 support, the
ability to auto-download modules when needed, and a highly
customizable user interface.</p></blockquote></div><p>Sounds good so far. But, why another project? Well, they have
a page that addresses that on their web site. They suggest that
configurability and a modular architecture is what has been missing
from other browsers. This was certainly true of Mosaic where a
virtual re-write was started.</p><p>This modular approach includes the user interface. That means
that those who love Motif will be able to use a Motif UI, those who
love Tk will be able to use a Tk UI and so on. They also have a
projected release date of July 14, 1997, which makes you think that
they are serious.</p><p>Both of these projects are for free software. And Linux has
proved that developing in a free environment can produce viable
products. In fact, the Arena project predated Netscape Navigator
and Microsoft Internet Explorer and some innovations in Arena were
later used in these commercial products. If you have interest in
the Web and are looking for a project, check these out.</p><p><a href="2219s1.html" target="_self">Where to Find Out
