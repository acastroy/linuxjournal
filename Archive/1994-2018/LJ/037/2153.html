<i  >Linux Journal</i>, and Lydia Kinata, SSC Products
Specialist, interviewed Przemek Klosowski, the founder of the
highly successful Washington DC Linux Users Group. The interview
was conducted via e-mail on January 21, 1997.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Marjorie:</em></span>
First, why don't you tell us a little about yourself?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> I was born in
Poland, and I lived there until 1985. I came to the US to attend
graduate school in Physics, at the University of Notre Dame. I now
work as a researcher at University of Maryland. Besides work, I
enjoy being with my wife, daughter and cat. We like nature walks,
alpine skiing and socializing (we have been known to have 8-hour
meals with our friends). My music tastes are rather eclectic&mdash;I
like Bach as well as Bartok, Miles Davis and the band &ldquo;Morphine&rdquo;.
I also like tinkering with things mechanical, electronics and
computers. Therefore, my favorite radio programs are &ldquo;Schickele
Mix&rdquo; and &ldquo;Car Talk&rdquo;, conveniently broadcast back-to-back on our
local public radio station.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Marjorie:</em></span>
Tell us something about your club's history: when you got started,
number of charter members, etc.?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> We started the club
in July 1994. There are pockets of computer industry around the
Beltway, including the suburbs north of Washington where I live.
Hoping to reach such computer folks, I posted announcements to some
mailing lists and newsgroups, and distributed leaflets in libraries
and computer stores in the area. I expected a few people to show up
for the first meeting, but my expectations were exceeded&mdash;over 70
people appeared. Since then, we have had about 30 people attend
regularly, with some meetings attracting over a hundred folks. Our
most popular meetings featured a WWW talk, when the Web was still a
novelty, and a talk by Linus Torvalds himself.</p><p>Our DCLUG (DC metropolitan area Linux User Group) is the
oldest and largest club, but other groups also serve people in
farther regions of the DC urban sprawl&mdash;LUGMAN in Manassas,
Northern Virginia, and UMLUG (University of Maryland folks). In
addition to our Linux activities, we are friends with the
Washington Area Unix User Group (WAUUG) and the DC System
Administrators' Guild (DC-SAGE). We are cooperating on talks and
activities; quite a few people are active in multiple
groups.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Marjorie:</em></span>
How many members do you have now and what are the group's
demographics (i.e., age, gender, profession, etc.)?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> We have a varied
distribution: a bunch of Gen-Xers, and then a regiment of computer
industry veterans&mdash;people who actually remember the beginnings of
the computer revolution. I do worry that we have very few students;
this is partly due to the fact that we aren't meeting anywhere near
a school, meaning a long commute for the typical student.</p><p>Indeed, selecting a meeting place is very important. An ideal
place would be near major highways <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> public
transportation; a university campus might be a good idea. We meet
in an auditorium at the National Institutes of Health&mdash;a nice
place, but it's quite a commute for most of us.</p><p>As for gender, unfortunately we don't have many female
members; we would certainly welcome more gender and ethnic variety,
but the simple fact remains that the typical member is a young
male.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Marjorie:</em></span>
Tell us about a typical meeting. Are they fairly informal, or do
you have planned talks and activities?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> We normally
schedule a speaker for our meetings. I believe it helps to keep up
with the effort. If nothing in particular is scheduled, it is
somehow easier to stay home. Featuring scheduled talks keeps the
momentum up.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Marjorie:</em></span>
Do you host special training sessions and/or install fests? Any
annual events?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> David Lesher and
David Niemi did a wonderful job organizing our four Install Fests.
Interestingly, our last fest had a small turnout compared to the
previous ones&mdash;could it be that Linux has become so easy to
install?</p><p>Actually, both Davids agree that the trickiest part in
organizing the install fest is the preparation&mdash;choosing the right
time, spreading the word and registration. We insist on
registration not only to have a handle on what to prepare in the
way of resources and equipment (desk space, network hookups, etc.)
but, perhaps more importantly, to get the participants to collect
solid information about their hardware.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Marjorie:</em></span>
Do you attend conferences as a group and set up a booth? If so,
which conferences? Any experiences you'd like to share with
us?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> We have attended
the Washington DC conference (FedUnix/Open Systems World) for three
years in a row; the organizer (Alan Fedders of the Washington Area
Unix User Group) kindly lets us set up a booth there. We usually
shift our November meeting to coincide with the conference place
and time; this way, we can reach more people who might not hear
about us otherwise.</p><p>We run the club with a minimal amount of organization. We do
not have formal membership, club dues or formal leadership. This
makes it more difficult to operate events. We can't rent space
and/or equipment, and we look like poor cousins of better-endowed
clubs such as PC User Group (the DOS/Windows folks) or even the
area Unix user group. On the other hand, none of us want the club
to develop into a part-time job, so we don't mind.</p><p>We haven't found the lack of funds to be a limitation&mdash;we get
by through trading favors, borrowing things, doing the work
ourselves and light fund-raising.</p><p>One coup we managed to pull off is our very own Linux server.
David Niemi made arrangements with Erol's, a large ISP in our area,
to let us use one of their computers connected to their internal
backbone. This allows us to maintain a local high bandwidth Linux
FTP mirror as well as our own WWW server (http://linux.wauug.org,
with our club's home page at /dclinux/dclinux.html) and assorted
mailing lists. Needless to say, the machine runs under Linux. In
return, we try to help Erol's in various little ways.</p><p>For fund-raising, we distributed some vendor CDs during our
install fest (we obtained them on commission, so we didn't have any
up-front costs). The income will enable us to expand disk space on
our server in the near future.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Marjorie:</em></span>
What are some of the reasons your members give for using
Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> I haven't asked
widely, but my guess is that people use Linux because it provides a
&ldquo;turn-key&rdquo; development platform, often with the capabilities not
provided by commercial systems (Unix or Windows), and of course,
you can't beat the price. Actually, for many people it is not the
money that matters most. Rather, it is the aggravation of
completing and configuring their system from many disjointed
elements (a TCP stack from this company, an NFS server from that
company, an X server from a third one, to give a Wintel-related
example)--and that was just for basic system functionality. Then,
one still has to load all the software that comes standard with
Linux distributions: compiler tool-chain, multi-media/WWW tools,
etc.</p><p>For those of us who have to develop solutions to nonstandard
computer problems, as is often the case in my area of scientific
research, Linux offers a better platform because of its openness
and freedom. A perfect example is the adaptation of Linux to do
hard real-time embedded computing (described recently in
<i  >Linux Journal</i>)--such a project would be
impractical without the availability of the kernel source.</p><p>And, last but not least, Linux lets us (some say &ldquo;forces us
to&rdquo;) hone our computer skills. I have learned many things about
computers (hardware and software) while using my Linux
system.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Lydia:</em></span>
How many of your members are primarily using Linux in their
business? What applications do they use?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> Quite a few of our
members use Linux at work, but in many cases it is low-key and/or
their bosses don't know (or want to know) about it. There are some
spectacular exceptions, e.g., Donald Becker uses Linux as the basis
for the Beowulf project
(http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/beowulf/beowulf1.html). And
Erol's uses Linux extensively as an Internet server platform, as do
other ISPs in the area.</p><p>In general, people in science, research and development tend
to have an easier time applying Linux&mdash;there is not as much
enforced uniformity. For instance, in my laboratory, many
researchers have their own Intel-based PCs. Some prefer Windows,
some prefer Linux. Linux tends to be easier to maintain&mdash;once set
to working, it stays working.</p><p>For those who require Microsoft applications in their work,
we often set up Wabi. This gives us the best of both worlds: good,
user-friendly applications, on a solid OS. If only the anti-trust
law enforcement people would actually do their job and break up
Microsoft into an applications company and an OS company, everyone
would be much happier.</p><p>At the moment, we use Linux to do mundane things&mdash;graphics
display, word processing, data visualization&mdash;but we plan to employ
it for actual control of hardware instruments. In fact, if some
young reader is interested in such topics and likes living near DC,
please get in touch with me; I am looking for an able young
programmer.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Lydia:</em></span>
Do you or any of your members contribute to the development of the
Linux kernel? Utilities or patches?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> Donald Becker wrote
a majority of the network drivers for Linux. Eric Youngdale worked
on iBCS, Intel and Alpha-shared libraries and high-level SCSI code.
David Niemi co-maintains Mtools, and has worked on the floppy
driver and &ldquo;other bits here and there&rdquo;.</p><p>Others among us have contributed to various parts of the
kernel and applications, in both big ways and small (I contributed
in minor ways to various projects such as Emacs Calc, xmgr and
tcl/expect).</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Lydia:</em></span>
What are your thoughts on the pros and cons of the currently
available distributions?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> I personally like
Red Hat, because housekeeping on their system is easy due to the
Red Hat Package Manager (RPM). Upgrading the Red Hat system is
easier than other systems that I have used. Other people swear by
Yggdrasil, Debian, Craftworks and Slackware&mdash;the differences aren't
that great.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Marjorie:</em></span>
What do you see as the main purpose of your users group? Users
groups in general?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> Linux user groups
let people create their own local support systems. This is
important especially when an answer can't be found by searching the
available documentation. True, everyone can post questions to
worldwide Linux newsgroups, but getting an actual answer is a
different matter. A local support market is more friendly,
too.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Marjorie:</em></span>
To what do you attribute the success of your group?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> I think half of
being successful is to stay in business long enough to create a
distinct group of people willing to participate over the long
term.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Marjorie:</em></span>
What do you think the future holds for Linux and Linux user
groups?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> Linux is here to
stay and flourish. It is a complicated system, and every once in a
while it requires some expertise. The nice thing is that if you
have a problem, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> it is solvable, and
will usually yield to the &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; method of experimenting
and progressive elimination. This is to be contrasted with the
&ldquo;let's install the latest version of a screen driver&rdquo;
approach.</p><p>Linux user groups concentrate local Linux knowledge and are
therefore a valuable resource. I imagine businesses using Linux
might appreciate such a resource and draw on it for consulting
and/or hiring, although we aren't at this stage yet.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Lydia:</em></span>
How far do you think Linux can go as a competitor for Microsoft
operating systems or commercial versions of Unix?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Przemek:</b></span> I don't think Linux will
get a &ldquo;market share&rdquo; comparable to that of Microsoft Windows. I
propose that even if there were a free, high-performance engine
which fit the Ford Escort, most people would still drive the
factory-provided one for it. Similarly, most people would probably
opt to trade off the competitive features of Linux, because they
don't want to, or cannot, cope with its complexity.</p><p>I do think Linux will continue to have a major impact on the
computer industry by shaming it into action. It must be
embarrassing for vendors to fail to provide some functionality (a
network protocol or a hardware driver or protected virtual
memory)--it can no longer be brushed off as &ldquo;too hard to
do&rdquo;.</p><p>As to commercial Unix, I think Linux will entrench and become
a major player. As of today, in our lab we have more systems
running Linux than all other commercial Unices combined.</p><p>Thank you for the opportunity to talk about our club and
about Linux.</p><p>Greetings,</p></div></div>
