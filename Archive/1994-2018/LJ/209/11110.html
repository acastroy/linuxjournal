DeLorme's inReach</h2></div></div><p>
We'll be expecting letters to the editor from Antarctica once the more
intrepid among you get DeLorme's new inReach, a personal communicator
that delivers two-way communication beyond the reach of cell-phone
signals and one-way satellite systems. The Iridium Communications-based
inReach offers &ldquo;pole to pole&rdquo; two-way satellite text messaging,
delivery confirmations, SOS capabilities, remote tracking and an Android
smartphone interface. The device's core communications component is
the Iridium 9602 short-burst data transceiver, which utilizes the
company's far-reaching satellite network. The GPS-enabled inReach
can be used by itself or paired with either an Android smartphone or
a DeLorme Earthmate PN-60w. With the standalone inReach, users can
send pre-loaded text messages to designated recipients and activate
remote tracking, allowing others to follow one's travels on-line via
a &ldquo;bread crumb&rdquo; trail. When paired with an Android or the DeLorme
Earthmate PN-60w, users enjoy full-featured, two-way text messaging
to and from e-mail addresses and cell phones, as well as the ability to
post to
Facebook and Twitter.

Mellanox's FDR 56Gb/s InfiniBand Solutions</h2></div></div><p>
Mellanox recently unveiled a complete end-to-end solution for FDR 56Gb/s InfiniBand consisting of adapter cards, switch systems, software
and cables, a feat that the firm calls an industry first. The solution
consists of Mellanox's ConnectX-3 FDR 56Gb/s InfiniBand adapters,
SX-6000 series switch systems, Unified Fabric Manager (UFM), Mellanox OS,
software accelerators and FDR copper and fiber cables. As a package, it
delivers &ldquo;the highest level of networking performance while reducing
system power&rdquo;, according to the company. The combination enables
cost-effective networking topologies for HPC, financial services,
database, Web 2.0, virtualized data centers and cloud computing.

Emphase's S3 Series Compact SATA modules</h2></div></div><p>
Emphase's new S3 Series line of compact SATA modules&mdash;that is, the
CFast, SATA Flash Module, and mSATA&mdash;offers big performance in a
small package, combining performance, dependability and longevity with
extremely low power consumption and the most compact footprint. When
space is an issue, this team of SLC NAND solid-state devices is an ideal
solution. Transfer speeds have been increased to 120R/100W; capacities
range from 1GB&ndash;32GB, with a 64GB capacity in the pipeline. The
quick-and-rugged CFast S3 is the solution for data mobility or where hot-swap
functionality is a must. The SATA Flash Module S3 weighs in at less
than 10 grams and plugs directly, vertically or horizontally, in to
a board's SATA port. The mSATA S3 is ideal for a low-profile embedded
system, integrating high performance and capacity at less than 4mm
thick. All modules now integrate TransferSAFE technology to weather-inconsistent power scenarios and operate off as little as 0.5 Watts,
well below the average of 3 Watts.

Acquia's Commons</h2></div></div><p>
Here's a recipe for a kick-booty social software solution: download
Drupal, stir in Acquia's updated open-source Commons 2.0, mold carefully
with your creative vision and skill and <span   class="emphasis"><em>voil&agrave;</em></span>&mdash;you've got yourself
an engaging community Web site. Commons melds rapidly evolving social Web
features, including activity streams, social networking, blogs, wikis,
badges and events together with enterprise-class analytics, support
and management services. The result is a &ldquo;prepackaged open-source
alternative to proprietary social business solutions&rdquo; that gives
companies extensive freedom to extend and adapt their community sites to
meet unique business needs. Version 2.0 adds features such as increased
style flexibility, access to Acquia Cloud, increased configuration
options, more support resources and complete design and theming control,
including prebuilt Commons themes. A number of service packages are
available from Acquia.

David Kennedy, Jim O'Gorman, Devon Kearns and Mati Aharoni's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Metasploit: A Penetration
Tester's Guide</em></span> (No Starch)</h2></div></div><p>
You may be familiar with the the Metasploit Framework, a toolset that
makes discovering, exploiting and sharing vulnerabilities quick and
relatively painless. The challenge for security professionals is that
the documentation is lacking, and it can be hard to grasp for first-time
users. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Metasploit: A Penetration Tester's Guide</em></span> from No Starch Press
intends to fill this gap by teaching how to harness the Framework, use
its many features and interact with the vibrant community of Metasploit
contributors. Readers will learn to find and exploit unmaintained,
misconfigured and unpatched systems; perform reconnaissance and find
valuable information about targets; bypass antivirus technologies and
circumvent security controls; integrate Nmap, NeXpose and Nessus with
Metasploit to automate discovery; use the Meterpreter shell to launch
further attacks from inside the network; harness standalone Metasploit
utilities, third-party tools and plugins; and learn how to write
Meterpreter post-exploitation modules and scripts.

Jason Andress and Steve Winterfeld's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cyber Warfare: Techniques,
Tactics and Tools for Security Practitioners</em></span> (Syngress)</h2></div></div><p>
Jason Andress and Steve Winterfeld's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cyber Warfare: Techniques,
Tactics and Tools for Security Practitioners</em></span> explores the battlefields,
participants and the tools and techniques used during today's digital
conflicts. The concepts discussed in this book will give those involved
in information security at all levels a better idea of how cyber conflicts
are carried out now, how they will change in the future and how to detect
and defend against espionage, hacktivism, insider threats and non-state
actors like organized criminals and terrorists. The authors provide
concrete examples and real-world guidance on how to identify and defend
a network against malicious attacks, dive deeply into relevant technical
and factual information from an insider's point of view, and outline the
ethics, laws and consequences of cyber war and how computer criminal
law may change as a result.

Likewise Open</h2></div></div><p>
With Likewise Open, recently upgraded to version 6.1, admins can
standardize on Microsoft Active Directory in their enterprise networks
without losing the flexibility to choose non-Microsoft operating
systems. The open-source Likewise Open allows single sign-on for critical
enterprise applications, such as Apache Tomcat, IBM WebSphere, Oracle
WebLogic and JBoss Application Server. Newly open-sourced integrations
include the Kerberos/NTLM JAAS login module and SPNEGO Kerberos/NTLM servlet
filter, which can be integrated with any servlet spec2.3-compliant
application server. Customers wishing to extend event management,
auditing and reporting for compliance with SOX, PCI-DSS, HIPPA and
other industry standards to these integrations can do so by upgrading
to Likewise Enterprise.

QLogic's InfiniBand Fabric Suite</h2></div></div><p>
The new 7.0 release of QLogic's InfiniBand Fabric Suite (IFS)&mdash;a
fabric management software package that enables users to optimize fabric
performance and communications efficiency for HPC clusters&mdash;is
now available. IFS 7.0's leading new feature is the integration of
vFabric QoS (Quality of Service) with work-flow schedulers from Adaptive
Computing and Platform Computing, making it possible for HPC users to
set a priority and QoS level as the message-passing interface application
is being scheduled. This reduces management overhead, simplifies cluster
scheduling and optimizes use of the fabric. Other noteworthy features
include an enhanced Fabric Viewer with Fabric Dashboard, improved static
routing performance, an improved Congestion Control Algorithm and support
for both NVIDIA GPUs and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6/6.1. The result of
this feature set, says QLogic, is an ability for HPC customers to obtain
maximum performance and efficiency from their cluster investments while
simplifying management.
