If I've learned nothing else from American politics, it's that it 
doesn't take knowledge or insight on a topic to have lots to say on
the matter. Thankfully, although this issue's Programming focus isn't even
close to my area of expertise, our authors don't have that
shortcoming. The worst you should have to put up with is me trying to
explain what this issue contains. Feel free to point and laugh.
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin, a fellow sysadmin, works through an interesting conundrum
this month. You're all familiar with programs like DBAN for wiping
sensitive data, but what if you need to delete information securely on a
server thousands of miles away? (Or, in the next room if you're lazy like
me.) Kyle shows how to go about taking care of a seemingly difficult
chicken/egg scenario. Kyle also shares a &ldquo;Tale from the Server
Room&rdquo; with
Bill Childers and talks about the joy of UPS delivery&mdash;more specifically,
when servers are unboxed, sometimes things don't go quite as planned.
</p><p>
If you're beginning to worry our Programming issue doesn't contain
articles about programming, fear not. Yes, we try to include a little
something for everyone, but this issue focuses on programming, and we've
got tons of useful stuff for you. Nathanael Anderson starts out with
an appealing way to learn multiplatform GNU development: getting a guitar
synth to work with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rock Band 3</em></span>. Unfortunately, there's no programming
that can make me any better at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rock Band</em></span>, but using a real guitar is a
step in the right direction!
</p><p>
My friend Adrian Hannah is back this month with a primer on the Make
utility. For most users, prepackaged applications are how programs are
installed. For programmers, or people on the bleeding edge, it's necessary
to compile programs themselves. Adrian shows how to &ldquo;make&rdquo; programs from
their source code. Sometimes when you are on the bleeding edge, you'll
notice that a newer version of an application isn't always better than
the previous version. Programmers need to be aware of such things, and
Bart Polot and Christian Grothoff show us Gauger, a tool that monitors
performance regression. Sometimes an application is slower because it
has more features, but sometimes it's just slower because of an erroneous
source code change. Gauger helps determine when new versions go bad.
</p><p>
When I took programming in college, I started out learning to program
command-line utilities that did little more than solve the problem
presented in the curriculum. If programming was a little more interesting
back then, I might have stuck with it for longer than the single semester
it was required. My problem was that I wanted to make GUI programs.
PJ Radcliffe shows how to develop GUI interfaces with Qt4 Designer
and Eclipse. Granted, a fancy GUI controlling a cruddy underlying program
isn't very useful, but at least for me, a cool-looking program is
something I'd like to spend time perfecting. PJ shows how easy it
can be to include GUI controls.
</p><p>
If GUI programs aren't for you, that's fine too. Adrian Klaver explores
jEdit, which is a very powerful and cross-platform text editor.
jEdit has features that make programming much easier, and its cross-platform nature means you can use a consistent interface regardless
of the computer you're stuck using. Arnold Robbins is a fan of text
as well, and he presents GNU Awk version 4. Awk has been around forever,
and although it's still as useful as it's ever been, version 4 offers a
few new tricks as well.
</p><p>
Of course, we have our regular columnists teaching about programming
this month as well. Reuven M. Lerner discusses CoffeeScript, a different way to
program JavaScript. Dave Taylor finishes his series on determining
the day of the week in a script. Plus, we have many other
programming-related articles as well! Henry Van Styn describes how to
write object-oriented code in Perl, Donald Emmack teaches how to use WaveMaker,
and we've even included the results of a LinuxJournal.com programming survey so you can see what your
fellow Linux programmers are up to.
</p><p>
If you're a programmer, this issue likely will be one of your favorites of
the year. If you're not a programmer, there still are exciting
things to read, and you might find that programming is more interesting than
you originally thought. I know I learned a lot this month, and I might
have to dust off my old C++ course book and figure out how to make a GUI
version of &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;. Either way, we hope you enjoy
reading this
issue as much
as we enjoyed putting it together.
