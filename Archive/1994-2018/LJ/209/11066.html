In the modern world of Integrated Development Environments, we forget what
really goes into compiling a large code project. This article should
be a refresher on (or teach for the first time) the basics of
makefiles, the most underrated part of any code project.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29ad2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In a compiled language, the makefile is arguably the most important part of any
programming project. To compile your project, you first have to compile each
source file into an object file, which in turn needs to be linked with system
libraries into the final executable file. Each command can have a
considerable number of arguments added in. That's a lot of typing and a lot
of potential for mistakes. The more source files you have, the more complex
the compilation process becomes, unless you use makefiles. Most Linux users
have at least a cursory knowledge of make and makefiles (because that's how we
build software packages for our systems), but not much more than that. Most
developers probably don't have too much in-depth experience with makefiles,
because most Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have the
capability of managing makefiles for them. Although this is convenient most of
the time, knowing more about how make works and what goes into makefiles can
help you troubleshoot compilation errors down the road.
</p><p>
According to make's man page, &ldquo;The purpose of the make utility is to determine
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and
issue the commands to recompile them.&rdquo; Essentially, make is used to
determine
efficiently (and without user error) which portions of the source
code have been updated since the last compilation and recompile them. It can
be used for more than just compiling programs. Because it isn't limited to
any particular language, you can use it for anything you can come up with
that relates to the modified date of a group of files.
</p><p>
Running make is a straightforward process. The more convoluted portion of
using make is constructing the makefile. The makefile is a file that
consists of a series of rules that define the dependencies of your project.
These rules govern the behavior of make during execution.

Command lines must be indented with tab characters; spaces cause funky
errors. This has been a design flaw in make for decades. Empty lines must
still have a tab character or else make will throw a fit.

Rules and Targets</h2></div></div><p>
Each rule in the makefile is an independent series of commands that are
executed in order to build a target. Make does not necessarily run each rule
in order. Make will run through the rules recursively, building each target
in turn, based on modification. Rules are formatted like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
target: dependency list ...

        commands

        ...
</pre>
</p><p>
The target is typically the name of a file, but it can be a phony target
(discussed later in this article). The dependency list is a space-separated
list of files that designate whether the target needs to be rebuilt. The
commands can be any shell command, so long as the target is up to date at the
end of them. It is imperative that you indent the commands with a tab
character and not spaces. This is a design flaw in make that has yet to be
fixed, and it will cause some strange and obscure errors should you use spaces
instead of tabs in your makefile.
</p><p>
When make encounters a rule, it first checks the files listed in the
dependency list to ensure that they haven't changed. If one of them has,
make looks through the makefile for the rule containing that file as the
target. This recursion continues until a rule is found where all the
dependencies are unchanged or rebuilt (or have no further dependencies), and
then make executes the listed commands for that rule before returning to the
previous rule, and so on, until the root rule has been satisfied and its
commands run.
</p><p>
You may use pattern-matching characters to describe dependencies in the
dependency list or in commands, but they may not be used in the target.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29ae1c8"></a>
Phony Targets</h2></div></div><p>
Phony targets (also called dummy or pseudo-targets) are not real files; they
simply are aliases within the makefile. As I mentioned before, you can specify
targets from the command line, and this is precisely what phony targets are
used for. If you're familiar with the process of using make to build
applications on your system, you're familiar with <tt  >make
install</tt> (which installs the
application after compiling the source) or <tt  >make clean</tt>
(which cleans up the
temporary files created while compiling the source). These are two examples
of phony targets. Obviously, there are no &ldquo;install&rdquo; or
&ldquo;clean&rdquo; files in the
project; they're just aliases to a set of commands set aside to complete some
task not dependent on the modification time of any particular file in the
project. Here is an example of using a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; phony target:


<pre     class="programlisting">
clean:
        -rm *.o my_bin_file
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29ae4e0"></a>
Special Targets</h2></div></div><p>
Some special targets are built in to make. These special
targets hold special meaning, and they modify the way make behaves during
execution:
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.PHONY</b></span> &mdash; this target signifies which other targets are phony targets. If a target is
listed as a dependency of .PHONY, the check to ensure that the target file
was updated is not performed. This is useful if at any time your project
actually produces a file named the same as a phony target; this check 
always will fail when executing your phony target.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.SUFFIXES</b></span> &mdash; the dependency list of this target is a list of the established file suffixes
for this project. This is helpful when you are using suffix rules (discussed
later in this article).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.DEFAULT</b></span> &mdash; if you have a bunch of targets that use the same set of commands, you may
consider using the .DEFAULT target. It is used to specify the commands to be
executed when no rule is found for a target.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.PRECIOUS</b></span> &mdash; all dependencies of the .PRECIOUS target are preserved should make be killed
or interrupted.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.INTERMEDIATE</b></span> &mdash; specifies which targets are intermediate, or temporary, files.
Upon completion, make will delete all intermediate files before terminating.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.SECONDARY</b></span> &mdash; this target is similar to
.INTERMEDIATE, except that these files will not be
deleted automatically upon completion. If no dependencies are specified, all
files are considered secondary.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.SECONDEXPANSION</b></span> &mdash;
after the initial read-in phase, anything listed after this target will be
expanded for a second time. So, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.SECONDEXPANSION:
ONEVAR = onefile
TWOVAR = twofile
myfile: $(ONEVAR) $$(TWOVAR)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29aeb10"></a></h2></div></div><p>
will expand to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.SECONDEXPANSION:
ONEVAR = onefile
TWOVAR = twofile
myfile: onefile $(TWOVAR)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29aec70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
after the initial read-in phase, but because I specified .SECONDEXPANSION, it
will expand everything following a second time:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.SECONDEXPANSION:
ONEVAR = onefile
TWOVAR = twofile
myfile: onefile twofile
</pre>
</p><p>
I'm not going to elaborate on this here, because this is a rather
complex subject and outside the scope of this article, but you can find all sorts of
.SECONDEXPANSION goodness out there on the Internet and in the GNU manual.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>.DELETE_ON_ERROR</b></span> &mdash;
this target will cause make to delete a target if it has changed and any of
the associated commands exit with a nonzero status.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.IGNORE</b></span> &mdash; if an error is encountered while building a target list as a dependency of
.IGNORE, it is ignored. If there are no dependencies to .IGNORE, make will
ignore errors for all targets.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME</b></span> &mdash;
for some reason or another, if you have files that will have a low-resolution
timestamp (missing the subsecond portion), this target allows you to
designate those files. If a file is listed as a dependency of
.LOW_RESOLUTION_TIME, make will compare times only to the nearest second
between the target and its dependencies.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.SILENT</b></span> &mdash; this is a legacy target that
causes the command's output to be suppressed. It
is suggested that you use Command Echoing (discussed in the Command Special
Characters section)
or by using the <tt  >-s</tt> flag on the command line.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.EXPORT_ALL_VARIABLES</b></span> &mdash; tells make to export all variables to any child processes created.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.NOTPARALLEL</b></span> &mdash;
although make can run simultaneous jobs in order to complete a task faster,
specifying this target in the makefile will force make to run serially.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.ONESHELL</b></span> &mdash;
by default, make will invoke a new shell for each command it runs. This
target causes make to use one shell per rule.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>.POSIX</b></span> &mdash;
with this target, make is forced to conform to POSIX standards while running.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29a5c90"></a>
Variables</h2></div></div><p>
In other versions of make, variables are called macros, but in the GNU
version (which is the version you likely are using), they are referred to as
variables, which I personally feel is a more appropriate title. Nomenclature
aside, variables are a convenient way to store information that may be used
multiple times throughout the makefile. It becomes abundantly clear the
first time you write a makefile and then realize that you forgot a command
flag for your compiler in all 58 rules you wrote. If I had used variables to
designate my compiler flags, I'd have had to change it only once instead of
58 times. Lesson learned. Set these at the beginning of your makefile
before any rules. Simply use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
VARNAME = information stored in the variable
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29a5e48"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to set the variable, and do use <tt  >$(VARNAME)</tt> to invoke it throughout the
makefile. Any shell variables that existed prior to calling make will exist
within make as variables and, thus, are invoked the same way as variables. You
can specify a variable from the command line as well. Simply add it to the
end of your make command, and it will be used within the make execution.
</p><p>
If, at some point, you need to alter the data stored in a
variable temporarily, there is a very simple way to substitute in this new data without
overwriting the variable. It's done using the following format:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$(VARNAME:find=replace)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29a6058"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where <tt  >find</tt> is the substring you are trying to find,
and <tt  >replace</tt> is the string
to replace it with. So, for instance:

<pre     class="programlisting">
LETTERS = abcxyz xyzabc xyz
print:
echo $(LETTERS:xyz=def)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29a6268"></a></h2></div></div><p>
will produce the output <tt  >abcdef xyzabc def</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29a63c8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

<tt  >CC</tt> &mdash; the name of the compiler.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >DEBUG</tt> &mdash; the debugging flag. This is -g in both g++ and cxx. The purpose of
the flag is to include debugging information into the executable, so that you
can use utilities like gdb to debug the code.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >LFLAGS</tt> &mdash; the flags used in linking. As it turns out, you don't need any
special flags for linking. The option listed is <tt  >-Wall</tt>, which tells the
compiler to print all warnings. But, that's fine. We can use that.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >CFLAGS</tt> &mdash; the flags used in compiling and creating object files. This includes
both <tt  >-Wall</tt> and <tt  >-c</tt>. The
<tt  >-c</tt> option is needed to create object files&mdash;that
is, .o files.
</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29a7290"></a>
Suffix Rules</h2></div></div><p>
In certain situations, you will find that the rules for a certain file type
are identical except for the filename. For instance, a lot of times in a C
project, you will see rules like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
file.o: file.c
        cc -O -Wall file.c
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x29a73f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
because for every .c file, you need to make the intermediate .o file, so that
the end binary then can be built. Suffix rules are a way of minimizing the
amount of time you spend writing out rules and the number of rules in your
makefile. In order to use suffix rules, you need to tell make which file
suffixes are considered significant (suffix rules won't work unless the
suffix is defined this way), then write the generic rule for the suffixes.
In the case described above, you would do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

.SUFFIXES: .o .c

.c.o:
        cc -O -Wall $&lt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You may note that in the case of suffix rules, the dependency suffix goes
before the target suffix, which is a reversal from the normal order in a
makefile. You also will see that you use <tt  >$&lt;</tt> in the command, which evaluates
to the .c filename associated with the .o file that triggered the rule.
There are a couple predefined variables like this that are used exclusively
for suffix rules:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >$&lt;</tt> &mdash; evaluates to the component that is being
used to make the target&mdash;that is, file.c.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >$*</tt> &mdash; evaluates to the filename part (without any suffix) of the component that
is being used to make the target&mdash;that is, file.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Note that the <tt  >$?</tt> variable cannot occur in suffix
rules, but the <tt  >$@</tt> variable
still will work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x2cbaf68"></a>
Command Special Characters</h2></div></div><p>
Certain characters can be used in conjunction with commands to
alter the behavior of make or the command. If you're familiar with
shell scripting, you'll recognize that <tt  >\</tt> signifies a line continuation.
That is to say, using <tt  >\</tt> means that the command isn't finished and continues
on the next line. Nobody likes looking at a messy file, and using this
character at the end of a line helps keep your makefile clean and
pretty. If a rule has more than one command, use a semicolon to separate
commands. You can start a command with a hyphen, and make will ignore any
errors that occur from the command. If you want to suppress the output of a
command during execution, start the command with an at sign (@).
</p><p>
Using these symbols will allow you to make a more usable and readable
makefile.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b5580.0x2cbb178"></a>
Directives</h2></div></div><p>
Sometimes, you need more control over how the makefile is read and
executed. Directives are designed exactly for that purpose.
</p><p>
From defining, overriding or exporting variables to importing other
makefiles, these directives are what make a more robust makefile
possible. The most useful of the directives are the conditional
directives though.
</p><p>
Conditional directives allow you to define multiple versions of a
command based on preexisting conditions. For example, say you have a
set of libraries you want included in your binary only if the compiler
used is gcc:

<pre     class="programlisting">
libs_for_gcc = -lgnu
normal_libs =

foo: $(objects)
ifeq ($(CC),gcc)
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(libs_for_gcc)
else
        $(CC) -o foo $(objects) $(normal_libs)
endif
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, you use <tt  >ifeq</tt> to check if CC equals
<tt  >gcc</tt> and if it
does, use the gcc libraries; otherwise, use the generic libraries.
</p><p>
This is just a small, basic sampling of the things you can do with
make and makefiles. There are so many more complex and interesting
things you can do, you just have to dig around to find them!
