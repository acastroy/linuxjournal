Write powerful object-oriented code in a modern and consistent style&mdash;in
Perl.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x18e1250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Perl has been around for more than 20 years. During that time, it has received
its share of both praise and criticism, and lots of
misconceptions surround it. Much of this stems from long-outdated
notions of what Perl used to be, but have nothing to do with what Perl
actually is today.
</p><p>
Perl hasn't been
standing still. It's been growing continuously and evolving, and that
growth has accelerated dramatically in the past few years. Moose is one of
the technologies at the heart of this &ldquo;Perl Renaissance&rdquo;, which also
includes other exciting projects that have emerged, such as Catalyst and
DBIx::Class.
</p><p>
Moose is essentially a language extension for Perl 5 that provides a
modern, elegant, fully featured object system. I say &ldquo;language
extension&rdquo;,
but Moose is written in pure Perl, and as you'll see, its syntax is still
normal Perl. You don't need to patch Perl itself to use Moose; under the
hood, it's just Perl 5.
</p><p>
Because Moose is still just Perl 5, it's fully compatible with all of those
wonderful modules on CPAN, regardless of whether they are written in
Moose (and most aren't, as CPAN has been around for so long, and Moose
is relatively new).
</p><p>
For me, this is still the single biggest reason to choose Perl. Whatever 
you are trying to accomplish, chances are, there already is a refined
module for it on CPAN. This usually means dramatic cuts in total
development time, because someone else already has written a lot of your
program for you.
</p><p>
And now, with all the modern object-oriented features Moose brings to
Perl, you get to
have your cake and eat it too. 
</p><p>
In this article, I provide an introduction to object-oriented programming in
Moose and cover some of Moose's core features with useful examples.
To get the most out of this article, you already should be familiar with
object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, objects, methods,
attributes, construction and inheritance.
</p><p>
You also need to know Perl&mdash;at least the fundamentals. If you don't know
Perl, learning it is not very hard to do. At the end of the
day, it's just syntax. The good news is you don't need to master Perl by
any stretch to start using Moose. 
</p><p>
Perl does have its quirks, and Moose doesn't make them all totally go away
(and you wouldn't want them all to go away, because a lot of them are really
useful). The most important concepts to understand are how Perl references
work (the &ldquo;perlreftut&rdquo; tutorial is a great place to
start&mdash;see Resources),
and also the basics of working with Scalars, Arrays and Hashes. Also, learn
what the fat comma is (=&gt;) if you aren't already familiar with it. Moose
makes heavy use of it as an idiom. It's actually not that scary; it's
interchangeable with the normal comma (,). 
</p><p>
Most of the rest of it you can learn as you go. Normal language stuff like
loops, conditionals and operators aren't all that different in Perl than
any other language. So give it a shot. I think you'll find it's well worth
the investment.

What about Perl 6?</b></p><p>
A lot of the features in Moose were inspired by Perl 6. Perl 6 still
is being developed actively, and I believe that when it's finally released for
production use, it won't disappoint. The fact is Perl 5 is solid, proven
and fast, so there is no reason to rush Perl 6. It is better that the
developers take the time to do it <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> right, which is exactly
what they're doing.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x18e1ae8"></a>
Getting Moose</h2></div></div><p>
Chances are you already have a distribution of Perl installed on your
system. You at least should have Perl 5.8, but preferably 5.10 or 5.12.
Installing Moose from CPAN is an easy task; simply run the following
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cpan Moose
</pre>
</p><p>
This should download and install Moose for you, as well as all of Moose's
dependencies.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x18e1ca0"></a>
Object-Oriented Perl (the Old Way)</h2></div></div><p>
Even though Perl has had object-oriented features for a long time, it was not originally
designed&mdash;syntactically&mdash;as an object-oriented language. This is more
about the API provided to the programmer than it is about the underlying
technical design of Perl itself.
</p><p>
Perl 5 provides a lean environment with the fundamental features and hooks
needed for object-oriented programming, but then leaves most of the details (such as setting up
object constructors, implementing attributes and handling validation) to
you. As a result, the &ldquo;right way&rdquo; to go about implementing these concepts
is open to interpretation.
</p><p>
The fundamental feature utilized by Perl to support objects is the
&ldquo;blessed&rdquo; reference. This is like the flux capacitor of objects in Perl.
Blessing simply associates a normal reference (usually a Hash reference)
with a class. The blessed reference then becomes the &ldquo;object
instance&rdquo;, and
its referent is used as the container to store the object's data.
</p><p>
The class name is the same thing as the package name, which is nothing
more than the namespace in which subroutines and variables are defined. The
subroutines defined in the given package namespace become the methods of
the class and can be called on the object reference.
</p><p>
All object-oriented languages have to do something along these lines to
implement objects under the hood. Other languages just don't impose so many
of the low-level details on the programmer as in pure Perl. 
</p><p>
Here is an example of a simple class in old-school Perl 5 OO:


<pre     class="programlisting">
package MyApp::Rifle;
use strict;

sub new {
        my ($class, %opts) = @_;
        $opts{rounds} = 0 unless ($opts{rounds});
        my $self = bless( {}, $class );
        $self-&gt;rounds($opts{rounds});
        return $self;
}

sub rounds {
        my ($self, $rounds) = @_;
        $self-&gt;{_rounds} = $rounds if (defined $rounds);
        return $self-&gt;{_rounds};
}

sub fire {
        my $self = shift;
        die "out of ammo!" unless ($self-&gt;rounds &gt; 0);
        print "bang!\n";
        $self-&gt;rounds( $self-&gt;rounds - 1 );
}

1;
</pre>
</p><p>
Save the above class definition into a file named MyApp/Rifle.pm within one
of your Perl's include directories, and then you can use it in a Perl
program like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
use MyApp::Rifle;
use strict;

my $rifle = MyApp::Rifle-&gt;new( rounds =&gt; 5 );
print "There are " . $rifle-&gt;rounds . " rounds in the rifle\n";
$rifle-&gt;fire;
print "Now there are " . $rifle-&gt;rounds . " rounds in the rifle\n";
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x18e2220"></a>
Moose Sugar</h2></div></div><p>
Moose is really nothing more than syntactic &ldquo;sugar&rdquo; that automatically
takes care of the boiler-plate tedium and low-level details of implementing
objects automatically. This is possible because of Perl's powerful
introspection capabilities&mdash;Moose dynamically manipulates the class
definition at compile time just as if it had been written that way.
</p><p>
The previous class could be implemented like this with Moose:


<pre     class="programlisting">
package MyApp::Rifle;
use Moose;

has 'rounds' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'Int', default =&gt; 0 );

sub fire {
        my $self = shift;
        die "out of ammo!" unless ($self-&gt;rounds &gt; 0);
        print "bang!\n";
        $self-&gt;rounds( $self-&gt;rounds - 1 );
}

1;
</pre>
</p><p>
Not only is this code much shorter, cleaner and easier to read, but it is
doing all the things the non-Moose class was doing and more. First,
Moose is automatically creating the &ldquo;new&rdquo; constructor method behind
the scenes. It is also automatically setting up &ldquo;rounds&rdquo; as an attribute
(aka object variable), which Moose understands as a distinct concept. 
</p><p>
Pure Perl has no such understanding; if you want &ldquo;attributes&rdquo;, you have to
implement them yourself by writing accessor methods by hand and deciding
how they should work (the non-Moose version above illustrates only one of
many possible approaches).
</p><p>
Moose, on the other hand, provides a refined, fully integrated object
attribute paradigm. It sets up the accessor methods, handles the data
storage and retrieval, and automatically configures the constructor to
initialize attributes optionally with supplied parameters&mdash;and that is just
scratching the surface!
</p><p>
One of the problems with the non-Moose version of our class is that there
is no validation for &ldquo;rounds&rdquo;. For example, nothing stops us from doing
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
my $rifle = MyApp::Rifle-&gt;new( rounds =&gt; 'foo' );
</pre>
</p><p>
This is one of the areas where Moose really shines; it provides a complete
Type system that is very straightforward to use. In the Moose version, the
option <tt  >isa =&gt; 'Int'</tt> sets up the rounds attribute with a type constraint
that automatically will throw an exception (with a meaningful message)
if you try to set the value to anything that is not a valid integer. This
would stop you from setting rounds to 'foo' because it's not an integer, it's
a string.
</p><p>
This illustrates an important point about Moose's design and approach.
Its syntax is <span   class="emphasis"><em>declarative</em></span> rather than
<span   class="emphasis"><em>imperative</em></span>. This means
you just need to specify what you want it to do instead of how it
needs to do it. This is in sharp contrast to the traditional Perl 5 OO
style, where that is exactly what you would have to do&mdash;add additional
lines of code in the accessor method to test the value for validity and
handle the result.
</p><p>
The syntax <tt  >isa =&gt; 'Int'</tt> doesn't provide any insight
on <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> Moose
will go about checking and enforcing the type constraint. And that's the
whole point&mdash;you don't care. But, you can rest assured it will do it in a
far more thorough and robust manner than anything you'd want to waste 
time on doing yourself. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x18e2b10"></a>
More about Attributes</h2></div></div><p>
You declare attributes in Moose with the &ldquo;has&rdquo; function. This consists of a
unique attribute name, followed by a list of named options (key/values).
Although it looks and behaves like a built-in language keyword, it is really
just a function call. Its documented syntax is just idiomatic for the
purpose of code readability (it's a fancy way to pass an argument
list).
</p><p>
Moose provides all sorts of options that define the behavior of a given
attribute, including setup of accessors, data types, initialization and
event hooks. The simplest attribute is just an object variable that is
set up as either read-write (rw) or read-only (ro) with the
&ldquo;is&rdquo; option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
has 'first_name' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw' ); 
</pre>
</p><p>
The is option tells Moose to set up the accessor method, which is what you
use to get and set the attribute's value. You set the value of an attribute
by passing a single argument to the accessor (such as
<tt  >$obj-&gt;first_name('Fred')</tt>), and you get the current value by calling the
accessor with no arguments (<tt  >$obj-&gt;first_name</tt>). Setting the value is only
allowed if the attribute &ldquo;is&rdquo; =&gt; &ldquo;rw&rdquo;. If it's
&ldquo;ro&rdquo;, and you try to set its
value through the accessor an exception will be thrown. 
</p><p>
This is the core of the attribute paradigm, but lots of other
options provide useful features. Here are a few of the noteworthy
ones:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
is: ro or rw, creates either a read-only or
read-write accessor method.
</p></li><li><p>
isa: string representing an optional type constraint.
</p></li><li><p>
default: the default value of the attribute.
</p></li><li><p>
builder: alternative to default&mdash;name of a method that
will generate the default.
</p></li><li><p>
lazy: if true, the attribute is not initialized until it's
used.
</p></li><li><p>
required: if true, attribute value must be provided to constructor or
have default/builder.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The builder option lets you specify a method to use to populate the
attribute's default value. A builder is a normal method defined within the
class, and its return value is used to set the attribute's initial value.
If the builder needs to access other attributes within the object, the
attribute must be lazy (to prevent it from potentially being populated
before the other attributes it depends on). 
</p><p>
Because this is such a common scenario, for convenience, Moose provides the
&ldquo;lazy_build&rdquo; attribute option that automatically sets the lazy option and
sets the builder to <tt  >_build_name</tt> (such as
<tt  >_build_first_name</tt> for an
attribute named <tt  >first_name</tt>). For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
has 'first_name' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'ro', lazy_build =&gt; 1 );
sub _build_first_name {
        my $self = shift;
        return $self-&gt;some_lookup('some data');
}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x1cdb910"></a>
Attributes Containing Objects</h2></div></div><p>
So far, I've talked only about attributes containing simple scalars.
Attributes can contain other types of values as well, including references
and other objects. For example, you could add a DateTime attribute to your
MyApp::Rifle class to keep track of the last time &ldquo;fire&rdquo; was called: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
package MyApp::Rifle;
use Moose;
use DateTime;

has 'rounds' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'Int', default =&gt; 0 );
has 'fired_dt' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'DateTime' );

sub fire {
        my $self = shift;
        die "out of ammo!" unless ($self-&gt;rounds &gt; 0);
	
        my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'local' );
        $self-&gt;fired_dt($dt);
	
        print "bang!\n";
        print "fired at " . $self-&gt;fired_dt-&gt;datetime . "\n";
	
        $self-&gt;rounds( $self-&gt;rounds - 1 );
}

1;
</pre>
</p><p>
This is fairly straightforward. I'm creating a new DateTime object and
storing it in my fired_dt attribute. Then, I can call methods on this
object, such as the datetime method, which returns a friendly string
representing the date and time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x1cdbb78"></a>
Delegations</h2></div></div><p>
Alternatively, you could utilize Moose's delegation feature when you set up
the fired_dt attribute, like this: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
has 'fired_dt' =&gt; ( 
        is =&gt; 'rw', 
        isa =&gt; 'DateTime',
        handles =&gt; {
                last_fired =&gt; 'datetime'
        }
);
</pre>
</p><p>
This will set up another accessor method named last_fired and map it to
the datetime method of the attribute. This makes the invocations of
<tt  >$self-&gt;last_fired</tt> and
<tt  >$self-&gt;fired_dt-&gt;datetime</tt> equivalent. This is
worthwhile because it allows you to keep your API simpler. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x1cdbde0"></a>
Types</h2></div></div><p>
Moose provides its own type system for enforcing constraints on the value
to which
an attribute can be set. As I mentioned earlier, type constraints are set
with the isa attribute option. 
</p><p>
Moose provides a built-in hierarchy of named types for general-purpose use.
For example, Int is a subtype of Num, and Num is a subtype of Str.
The value <tt  >'foo'</tt> would pass Str but not Num or Int; 3.4 would pass Str and
Num but not Int, and 7 would pass all of Str, Num and Int.
</p><p>
There also are certain built-in types that can be
&ldquo;parameterized&rdquo;, such as
ArrayRef (a reference to an array). This lets you not only require an
attribute to contain an ArrayRef, but also set type constraints on the
values that ArrayRef can contain. For example, setting <tt  >isa =&gt;
'ArrayRef[Int]'</tt> requires an ArrayRef of Ints. These can be nested multiple
levels deep, such as <tt  >'ArrayRef[HashRef[Str]]'</tt> and so on. 
</p><p>
Another special parameterized type is Maybe, which allows a value to be
undef. For example, <tt  >'Maybe[Num]'</tt> means the value is either undef or a Num.
</p><p>
You also can use type &ldquo;unions&rdquo;. For example,
<tt  >'Bool | Ref'</tt> means either Bool
or Ref.
</p><p>
If the built-in types aren't sufficient for your needs, you can define your
own subtypes to do any kind of custom validation you want. The
Moose::Util::TypeConstraints documentation provides details on creating
subtypes, as well as a complete listing of the built-in types that are
available (see Resources).
</p><p>
Finally, instead of specifying the name of a defined type, you can specify
a class name, which will require an object of that class type (such as in
our DateTime attribute example). All of these concepts can be intermixed
for maximum flexibility. So, for example, if you set <tt  >isa =&gt;
'ArrayRef[MyApp::Rifle]'</tt>, it would require an ArrayRef of MyApp::Rifle
objects.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x1cdc3b8"></a>
Inheritance</h2></div></div><p>
Subclassing is relatively painless in Moose. Use the extends function to
make a class a subclass of another. The subclass inherits all the
parent's methods and attributes, and then you can define new ones or
override existing ones simply by defining them again. 
</p><p>
Moose also provides helpful attribute inheritance sugar that allows you to
inherit an attribute from the parent, but override specific options in the
subclass. To tell Moose to do this, prepend the attribute name with a plus
sign (+) in a &ldquo;has&rdquo; declaration in the subclass. (Note: attribute options
related to accessor method names cannot be changed using this technique.)
</p><p>
For example, you could create a new class named MyApp::AutomaticRifle that
inherits from the MyApp::Rifle class from the previous example:


<pre     class="programlisting">

package MyApp::AutomaticRifle;
use Moose;
extends 'MyApp::Rifle';

has '+rounds' =&gt; ( default =&gt; 50 );
has 'last_burst_num' =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'rw', isa =&gt; 'Int' );

sub burst_fire {
        my ($self, $num) = @_;
	
        $self-&gt;last_burst_num($num);

        for (my $i=0; $i&lt;$num; $i++) {
                $self-&gt;fire;
        }
}

1;

</pre>
</p><p>
Here, MyApp::AutomaticRifle can do everything MyApp::Rifle can do, but
it also can &ldquo;burst_fire&rdquo;. Also, the default of the rounds attribute has
been changed to 50 in AutomaticRifle, but the rest of the options for the
rounds attribute still are inherited from the parent Rifle class.
</p><p>
You might use MyApp::AutomaticRifle like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
use strict;
use MyApp::AutomaticRifle;

my $rifle = MyApp::AutomaticRifle-&gt;new;
print "There are " . $rifle-&gt;rounds . " rounds in the rifle\n";
$rifle-&gt;burst_fire(35);
print "Now there are " . $rifle-&gt;rounds . " rounds in the rifle\n";
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x1cdc888"></a>
The BUILD Method</h2></div></div><p>
Although Moose automatically sets up the &ldquo;new&rdquo; constructor for you, there 
still are times when you need to execute custom code at construction. If you
need to do that, define a method named BUILD, and it will be called
immediately after the object has been constructed. Don't create a
&ldquo;new&rdquo;
method; that will interfere with Moose's operation.
</p><p>
BUILD is also special as it relates to inheritance. Unlike normal methods
that override the parents' methods when redefined in subclasses, BUILD can
be defined in every class in the inheritance tree and every one will be
called, in order from parent to child.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x1cdca98"></a>
Roles</h2></div></div><p>
Roles define some set of behaviors (attributes and methods) without being
full-blown classes themselves (capable of instantiation as objects
directly). Instead, Roles are &ldquo;composed&rdquo; into other classes, applying the
defined behaviors to those classes. Roles are conceptually similar to
&ldquo;mixins&rdquo; in Ruby.
</p><p>
Roles also can require that consuming classes have certain methods by
calling the &ldquo;requires&rdquo; sugar function in the Role definition (or throw an
exception).
</p><p>
You call the &ldquo;with&rdquo; sugar function to consume a Role by name, just like you
call &ldquo;extends&rdquo; to inherit from a regular class. 
</p><p>
Here is an example of a simple Role that could be composed into either
MyApp::Rifle or MyApp::AutomaticRifle:

<pre     class="programlisting">
package MyApp::FireAll;
use strict;
use Moose::Role;

requires 'fire', 'rounds';

sub fire_all {
        my $self = shift;
        $self-&gt;fire while($self-&gt;rounds &gt; 0);
}

1;
</pre>
</p><p>
You would then add this single line to MyApp::Rifle or
MyApp::AutomaticRifle to give either class the fire_all method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
with 'MyApp::FireAll';
</pre>
</p><p>
In the case of MyApp::AutomaticRifle, the with statement must be called
after the extends statement, because the &ldquo;fire&rdquo; and
&ldquo;rounds&rdquo; methods don't
exist within MyApp::AutomaticRifle before that, and the Role's requires
statements would fail. 
</p><p>
If you add the Role to MyApp::Rifle, it will be inherited by
MyApp::AutomaticRifle automatically, so there would be no need to add it there also
(although it won't break anything if you do).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17e9580.0x1cdd0c8"></a>
Method Modifiers</h2></div></div><p>
Method modifiers are one of the more powerful and flexible features of
Moose. The most common types of modifiers are before, after and around.
Before and after are really just &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; to execute some code whenever a
given method is called, either before or after, as the names imply. For
example, this would print a string every time <tt  >fire_all</tt> is called:

<pre     class="programlisting">
before 'fire_all' =&gt; sub {
        my $self = shift;
        print "Say hello to my little friend!\n";
};

The &ldquo;around&rdquo; modifier is quite a bit more powerful than before and after
because it actually can change the arguments passed to, and the data
returned from, the original method. It also can programmatically decide
whether even to call the original method at all.
</p><p>
Around modifiers actually replace the original method, but get passed the
original method and arguments to be able to call it within the new modifier
function, but unlike before and after, this has to be done manually in
around. The basic blueprint of this is below, which is an example of an
around modifier that exactly reproduces the original method (having no
observable effect): 

<pre     class="programlisting">
around 'fire_all' =&gt; sub {
       my ($orig, $self, @args) = @_;
       return $self-&gt;$orig(@args);
};
</pre>
</p><p>
In an around modifier, the first argument is the method
(<tt  >$orig</tt>) instead of
the object reference (<tt  >$self</tt>) like in normal methods.
Then, it's up to you to
call the original method (<tt  >$self-&gt;$orig</tt>) and capture
its return value (or
not) and then return.

Note:</b></p><p>
The semicolons at the end of the method modifier definitions in the
examples are required. Like all the keywords provided by Moose, the
modifier sugar keywords actually are function calls and are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> subroutine definitions. The modifier definitions are all just function calls
with exactly two arguments: a string representing the name of the method to
modify and a <span   class="emphasis"><em>code reference</em></span> to the actual modifier. CodeRefs are
just treated syntactically as values like any other. It's not important to
understand this fully to use method modifiers, but it is important to
remember to use the semicolons.
</p></div><p>
Method modifiers make a great fit with Roles to define behaviors at a
fine-grained level. Let's take a look at another example of a Role for our
MyApp::Rifle class that makes use of method modifiers:


<pre     class="programlisting">

package MyApp::MightJam;
use Moose::Role;
use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints;

requires 'fire';

subtype 'Probability' =&gt; (
        as 'Num',
        where { $_ &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; $_ &lt;= 1 },
        message { "$_ is not a number between 0 and 1" }
);

has 'jam_probability' =&gt; ( 
        is =&gt; 'ro', 
        isa =&gt; 'Probability', 
        default =&gt; .01 
);

sub roll_dice {
        my $self = shift;
        return 1 if ( rand(1) &lt; $self-&gt;jam_probability );
        return 0;
}

before 'fire' =&gt; sub {
        my $self = shift;
        die "Jammed!!!\n" if ($self-&gt;roll_dice);
};

1;

</pre>
</p><p>
This Role adds the random chance of &ldquo;Jamming&rdquo; on any given
call to &ldquo;fire&rdquo;
depending on the probability specified in the jam_probability attribute
(with the default probability set to 1%). I also illustrate here how to
create a custom subtype, by defining a new type &ldquo;Probability&rdquo;, which must be
a number between 0 and 1. 
</p><p>
You then could compose simple subclasses like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
package MyApp::CrappyRifle;
use strict;
use Moose;
extends 'MyApp::AutomaticRifle';
with 'MyApp::MightJam';

has '+jam_probability' =&gt; ( default =&gt; .5 );

1;
</pre>
</p><p>
And:

<pre     class="programlisting">
package MyApp::NiceRifle;
use strict;
use Moose;
extends 'MyApp::AutomaticRifle';
with 'MyApp::MightJam';

has '+jam_probability' =&gt; ( default =&gt; .001 );

1;
</pre>
</p><p>
The difference between these two is that CrappyRifle will jam on average 5
out 10 times, and NiceRifle will jam only 1 per 1,000 times.

Learning More</h2></div></div><p>
This article is just meant as an introduction to Moose, and because of
space constraints, I have been able to cover only a few of its core
features.
</p><p>
One of the other great things about Moose, and Perl in general, is the
community and availability of documentation and resources. The Moose
Manual, available on CPAN (see Resources), is well-written and
comprehensive. There are also plenty of other docs and information
available, and the number of them is growing every day as Moose continues
to gain popularity.
</p><p>
If you get stuck on something and can't find the answer, try the #moose IRC
channel on irc.perl.org. Many of the top experts are in this channel and
are more than willing to help and answer questions. Although they will expect
you to RTFM and have done your homework first, they will get you unstuck
and pointed in the right direction. 
</p><p>
If nothing else, I hope that this article has at least piqued your interest
in modern development with Perl and Moose, and that you can see that Perl
code can, in fact, be clean, easy to read and modern, while still being
&ldquo;Perlish&rdquo; and powerful.
</p><p>
As you learn Moose, and modern Perl in general, be sure to check out some
of the other projects and modules that are available, including Catalyst,
Template::Toolkit, DBIx::Class, Try::Tiny, Test::More and Devel::NYTProf,
just to name a few. You might be surprised what's out there, and what is
really possible with Perl today.
