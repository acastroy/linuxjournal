Ever since I discovered HTML, it's been my preferred format for writing.
Every word of mine that's gone into <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, since I started in 1996,
has been written and delivered in HTML. That's because my writing has been
normalized to hypertext, and to pixels rather than print.
</p><p>
What's different for me this time is that I'm not paying attention to my
monthly 900-word limit (or less if images are involved). While a word
limit does impose the discipline of brevity, the fact remains that brevity
is not the only virtue of good writing. Yes, it's a good one to have when
your column appears on the last page of a print magazine. But when
that magazine is no longer confined by the dimensions of printed pages,
you're free to go longer&mdash;or shorter, as the case may be.
</p><p>
My case this month is for the all-digital version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. Yes, we
lose a lot, but we stand to gain much more. Let me explain.
</p><p>
We've fought to stay in print ever since the dot-com crash nearly killed
us, 11 years ago. Before that crash, we were fat with ads from
well-funded startups. When the bust hit, many advertisers vanished without
a trace, owing us literally $millions we never collected. After that crash,
getting and keeping advertisers for a print trade publication was much
harder. The costs of printing and mailing also went up, and continued to go
up. Meanwhile, Linux succeeded in the marketplace and is now the most
widely used operating system.
</p><p>
Yet, while Linux continues to spread, the population of pure-Linux
geeks&mdash;the kind who subscribe to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>&mdash;has remained a core that has
grown very little. We continue to serve that core. That's our mission, and
we're sticking to it. The question is, what's the best way? Today, it's hard
to say print is that best way, especially with more and more people 
spending more and more time reading glowing rectangles rather than paper.
</p><p>
But, we are by nature and practice a print magazine, and we have done our
best to remain one, even as the world has changed around us. So I want to
congratulate the publishing side of our house for keeping our print
operation going, against stupendous odds, and for never selling out. (And
believe me, there were many offers, mostly from entities that are now
gone.) Our team did the impossible for as long as it could.
</p><p>
Yet, consider this. We also always have been a digital publication, starting
with the first CD digest of issues in 1994. And, digital publishing has done
nothing but grow from the beginning. So has advertising in the digital
realm, which is inherently limitless.
</p><p>
Something else also has started to happen in digital publishing. It has
become easier, and more acceptable, for people to pay for goods that also are
available for free. There has been much experimentation here, and we
are among the many doing the experimenting. One advantage for us is that
we've always had paying subscribers. Maybe it's crazy to think they'll
stick with us after we go all-digital. But, I don't think so. I'm a big
believer in the willingness of people to pay for value, provided the means
are there. We have some means today, and we will have better ones tomorrow,
especially if you help us think those through&mdash;while also helping us
improve our editorial methods and materials.
</p><p>
Every magazine has a periodical heartbeat. Ours always has been monthly.
That won't change. What will change is how much time passes between what we
write and when it appears. A production cycle that took several months will
now take just weeks. (So for
this issue, I am writing this on August 1st for a September
publication date.) Much more of our stuff will be current, or as close to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span> as we
can get.
</p><p>
We always will remain a print publication at heart (and in that respect,
we will be no different from the rest of journalism), but we won't remain
contained by the print medium. That medium, where nearly all of our
contributors grew up, has legacy values (fairness, transparency, credit to
sources and so on) that are important to bring to a vast new world that has
too little of them. Again, we expect you to help us with that.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> always has been a publication for the
Linux Community. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> will now be a publication by the Linux Community as well. This is a
very good thing. Here in the digital world, connection between people and
ideas are much more direct and immediate. Understandings are also easily
iterated and improved. Just like code.
</p><p>
Maybe Linux doesn't need <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>&mdash;or anything, other than
continued constructive hacking in kernel space. But I do believe Linux has
been better with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> around than it would have been without it.
Therefore, with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> in a much more improve-able place, we can't
help but make Linux better in the process.
