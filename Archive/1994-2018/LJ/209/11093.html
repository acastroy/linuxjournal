<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #209, September 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Google's Mike Waychison</b></span> has posted some patches to organize
Google-specific firmware used in its servers. These patches were
met with approval by <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span>, although
Google's servers remain unavailable for purchase by the public.
Perhaps that will change soon.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Chris Wright</b></span> officially is no longer on the stable kernel team,
and he has not been involved in that project for some time. Greg
Kroah-Hartman will continue his effort to release several short-term
stable versions of each kernel, during the intervals between official
releases from <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>. Long-term stable trees in the 2.6 series
are maintained by <span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Willy Tarreau</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Paul
Gortmaker</b></span> and
others.
</p><p>
The ancient versioning system, <span   class="bold"><b>CVS</b></span>, still is being used by some kernel
developers in spite of the advent of <span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span>,
and <span   class="bold"><b>Sebastian Andrzej
Siewior</b></span> recently posted a patch supporting those developers. His patch
took out all the stale CVS $Id$ tags sprinkled throughout the kernel
that were confusing CVS. Apparently, some developers are syncing the
kernel sources from git and then feeding the whole tree into a CVS
repository before working on it&mdash;bizarre. But, it's a great testament to the
hardiness of CVS after so many years and so many attempts to find
something better.
</p><p>
A recent bug in <span   class="bold"><b>SysFS</b></span> allowed regular users
to overwrite <span   class="bold"><b>NVRAM</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>Vasiliy Kulikov</b></span>'s patch to close the
security hole had taken more than a
month to be incorporated into the kernel. In light of that, he's
posted a patch to give the system administrator the power to mount the
SysFS directory as read-only. This blanket protection would not be in
effect at all times, but it would give administrators the ability to lock
down that part of the system in the event that a similar bug were
discovered. The problem, as Greg Kroah-Hartman points out, is that
locking down SysFS may produce other unanticipated problems, and he
feels the right approach simply would be to fix SysFS bugs as they
occur, rather than add a blanket layer of security over it. The
debate is unresolved at the moment and could play out either way.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Huang Ying</b></span> recently posted some code to
cause unknown <span   class="bold"><b>non-masking
interrupts</b></span> (NMIs) to crash the kernel and produce a panic report.
But,
part of the problem is that a wide array of systems produce unknown
NMIs for no reason at all. Huang's solution was to create a whitelist
of systems that were known not to do this, and his patch would 
work only on that whitelisted set of systems. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo
Molnar</b></span> suggested
using <span   class="bold"><b>active event filters</b></span> to allow unknown NMIs to go through a
localized policy decision-making process first, so the decision to panic the
system could be made on a per-system basis.
</p><p>
Active event filters, as Ingo pointed out, would allow a certain
portion of the decision-making process to occur while still in kernel
space, without having to return to userland. This is key, because
when the system is crashing, it often is not feasible to pass control
over to a user-space program. But in the case where the active event
filters determined that a crash probably was not occurring, they could
hand control to a user-space d&aelig;mon that would make additional
decisions about how to handle the unknown NMI.
</p><p>
Active event filters apparently are tremendously powerful and soon may
be seen in use throughout the kernel as a way of standardizing a
number of disparate behaviors that currently are handled in an ad hoc
manner.

<h2 class="title">Computer-Aided Engineering in Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #209, September 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Engineers are some of the heaviest number-crunchers around. If you are a
grad student, post doc or undergrad, you usually get whatever is lying
around as your work machine. Also, depending on how inflexible your
local IT department is, you may be forced to use one of the
commercial operating systems around these days. What are lowly students to
do when they need to do heavy computational work? You may be interested
in looking at CAELinux (Computer Assisted Engineering, <a href="http://www.caelinux.com" target="_self">www.caelinux.com</a>). This project
provides a live CD that gives you all the open-source tools you
might need for your engineering work. And, because it is a live CD, you
can use it without touching the local drive of the machine you are using.
</p><p>
Like all live CDs, it has all the standard Linux desktop tools 
you should be familiar with, including Firefox for
Web browsing, Evolution for e-mail, and OpenOffice.org for word processing,
spreadsheets and presentations. Along with these applications, there
are dozens of others to help with all your number-crunching
work. The most recent versions are based on Ubuntu, so it should be
a fairly comfortable environment for most people. Be
aware, however, that you can't use the usual software update mechanism
in Ubuntu. Many of the packages in CAELinux are compiled from source
and optimized, so you don't want them being overwritten
accidentally by any packages provided by Ubuntu.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11093caef1.large.jpg"><img src="11093caef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Welcome to CAELinux
</p></div></div><p>
A really well written introduction to CAELinux is available right
on the desktop, called &ldquo;Getting Started&rdquo;. You should start here if this
is your first step into the world of CAELinux.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11093caef2.large.jpg"><img src="11093caef2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Getting Started
</p></div></div><p>
Last month, I looked at OpenFOAM in this space. CAELinux includes a full install
of OpenFOAM. It also includes another fluid dynamics program called
SALOME. This program provides a full graphical interface that takes
you from forming your problem, to modeling, to calculation and through
to analyzing your results. This might be a good choice for those who
are more comfortable with a GUI. A series of examples on the
desktop are available that provide a walk-through of the program,
showing each of the steps as you go through.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11093caef3.large.jpg"><img src="11093caef3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
CAELinux Tutorials
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, the tutorials walk through several common
simulations, like modeling flow through a pipe. These can provide great
starting points for many people.
</p><p>
If your work leans more toward data analysis, several popular
packages are available. For all of you Matlab addicts, there is Scilab.
Scilab provides the same types of functions in an environment
familiar to Matlab users. There also is Maxima, which provides tools
more from a mathematical background (for example, analyzing functions and doing
calculus), as compared to Scilab's approach of working from a matrix
background (such as looking at data analysis). Maxima has several front ends
available. The default one in CAELinux is wxMaxima. If you are doing
really heavy statistical analysis, there is R. The real power of R is the
CRAN repository, and a fair amount is available out of the box. R
also has several graphical front ends. CAELinux provides two:
R Commander and RKWard. If you are doing work more along the lines of
pure mathematical analysis, there also is Octave. The default
GUI available within CAELinux is QtOctave. In all of these cases,
text-based interfaces also are available, if you are an old-style computer user who prefers that kind of thing.
</p><p>
Several software packages exist for applications other
than CFD or statistics. If you need to do finite element analysis,
there's elmer. It provides both a text-based and GUI interface. There
also is JavaFoil, available for doing analysis on airfoils and wings. If you are
designing electrical circuits, two packages are available. Electric
is a CAD program that helps you lay out a circuit. And, once it is all laid
out, you can use PCB Designer to get it set up so you can etch a
board to make it real.
</p><p>
This is all fine and good if you can use a standard toolset in your
work. But, what if you need computing power for really cutting-edge
research? 
CAELinux provides the entire GNU toolset. This means you have
everything you need to go ahead and start developing your own code. All
of the most common scientific and engineering libraries, like gsl and
LAPACK, are available. If you are working on really large problems,
MPI and openMP also are available. This way, you can develop a parallel
programming solution if that is what your problem needs.
</p><p>
Once you have finished all your calculations, an important part of
data analysis is graphical analysis. There is something visceral and
instinctive about actually seeing your data represented. To this end,
CAELinux provides several packages. If
you simply want to plot your data, you can use programs like grace and
LabPlot. If you want to do more complicated data analysis, you have
programs like G3Data and OpenDX Data Explorer. These programs have lots
of functionality that can be used to look at your data graphically. If
you are doing CFD work, several programs for visualizing
your meshes are available. So, you have your choice based on what features
you need.
</p><p>
The last option to look at this month is using CAELinux in &ldquo;the
cloud&rdquo;. Cloud computing is one of those sexy terms that gets used a lot in
marketing, but it sometimes doesn't really give you anything useful. In this
case, there really is something substantial being offered. CAELinux 
now can be run as an application under Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing. You
can now run, on demand, as many nodes as you like, each having eight
cores and 64GB of RAM. For people who don't have the resources to run
their own clusters, but need more than what a desktop can handle, this
can be a very attractive choice. It definitely is worth looking into
as a possible option. You can find more information about EC2 at
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2" target="_self">aws.amazon.com/ec2</a>, and the CAELinux Web site has a very good
set of instructions to get you up and running.
</p><p>
As you can see, CAELinux provides a lot of power and functionality for
doing computational science. Because it is a live CD, you can run it on
essentially any 64-bit machine without touching the hard drive. But,
you also have the option of installing it on the machine if you are
allowed. Download an ISO and start playing with it to see just how
much work you can do with it.

<h2 class="title">CBZ, the MP3 of Comics</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #209, September 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Digital music and, more recently, digital video and digital books,
have changed the way we consume media. Comic books are no different,
and with the advent of tablet computers, digital comics are becoming
more and more popular. If you don't have a tablet computer, however,
viewing CBR (or their compressed version, CBZ) files is as simple as
installing a CBR reader and downloading your favorite comic.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11093comixf1.large.jpg"><img src="11093comixf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Many comic book readers are available for Linux. A quick Google
search will turn up programs like Comix, ComicMaster and Comical, all of
which display digital comics quite well. Another search likely will turn
up some free comic resources, like the one shown here: Cory Doctorow's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Futuristic Takes of the Here and Now</em></span>. If you miss the comic books of
your youth, or if you still enjoy them on a regular basis, you owe it to
yourself to check out CBR/CBZ files.

<h2 class="title">Rock Your World with Firefly</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #209, September 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
No, I'm not talking browncoats and spaceships. Unfortunately, that ship
has sailed. If you're the musical type, however, installing a Firefly
Media Server is fairly simple. It was renamed from mt-daapd, so your
distribution still might call it that. After a quick install, visit the
Web configuration, usually at http://localhost:3689 with the default login
mt-daapd and password mt-daapd. You can configure your music location,
smart playlists and just about every other aspect of the media server.
Then comes the cool part.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11093fireflyf1.large.jpg"><img src="11093fireflyf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
On any software or hardware on your network that supports daap (often
known as the iTunes protocol), you should be able to play your music
remotely. Firefly does a decent job of scanning your music collection
and updating the clients on the network. You can add m3u playlists,
and Firefly will serve up playlists as well.
</p><p>
I find the best way to listen to music on XBMC is via daap. It makes
configuring playlists and adding media simple. It's also cross-platform,
so those folks using actual iTunes can listen to their tunes as well.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #209, September 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Sometimes, you just want a simple word processor. Yes, there are
many options for word processing, from the awesome OpenOffice.org to the
awesome-for-other-reasons vi. If you're looking for a happy medium,
however, it's hard to do better than AbiWord. When you add the free
on-line component, AbiCollab.net, you even can collaborate with other
AbiWord users on documents.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11093fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
AbiWord is available for Linux, Windows and even OS X. You need version
2.8 or higher to use AbiCollab.net, but most distributions include at
least version 2.8. Check out the Web site at <a href="http://www.abisource.com" target="_self">www.abisource.com</a>.

<h2 class="title">Playterm, Platform of the Gurus</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Leon van Kammen</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #209, September 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Did you learn all your Linux console skills from books or from forums?
Or, did you peek over someone's shoulder to see the real action?
Once in a while, we stumble upon new projects that deserve some attention,
like Playterm (<a href="http://www.playterm.org" target="_self">www.playterm.org</a>).
What's the reason for this command-line &ldquo;peep show&rdquo;?
To spread GNU Linux command-line knowledge.
</p><p>
You will see a fair amount of on-line terminal recordings when you enter this site.
The recordings cover several topics performed in the shell: tricks, one-liners, guided tutorials and handy utilities.

</p><p>
Personally, I found them quite entertaining to watch, and it brought me back to the BBS days.
It can be educational, and also quite hilarious to see people making typos and mistakes.
</p><p>
Another interesting Playterm feature is the embed facility.
You can upload terminal recordings on this site, which you then can embed
and play on your blog or Web site.
Optionally, you can allow commenting on your recordings, which, of course,
will provide interesting hints and tips and other
improvements.
</p><p>
The Coder of Salvation (Leon van Kammen) created Playterm because he was
just too curious about what people
were doing in their terminals. He used to work for a company where he did
extreme programming sessions with his colleagues through the GNU <tt  >screen
-x</tt> utility.
In his experience, it is extremely educational when you work together in one terminal (and also entertaining).
In his opinion, console-related books and articles are great, but sometimes
it can be more helpful to see gurus at work.
If it were up to him, more command-line projects should feature a terminal
player on their sites:
&ldquo;Why not? Why have only a tar archive on a site? Developers should make more
demos to show the world how cool their utilities are! It hurts me to see so
many
great utilities being overseen by the masses.&rdquo;
Obviously, these are the words of a true terminal evangelist.
</p><p>
Before the big Internet boom, people used BBSes a lot (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system</a>).
People called to other people's BBSes via their phone line.
The cool thing about running your own BBS was that you could create a console
&ldquo;intervention&rdquo;.
By doing this, you could &ldquo;take over&rdquo; the terminal session of a given user.
In those days, a lot of teaching and cooperation was done this way.
</p><p>
Of course, the Playterm Web site would not be possible without the GNU and Open Source
movement.
Thanks also to the developers of ttyrec (<a href="http://0xcc.net/ttyrec" target="_self">0xcc.net/ttyrec</a>) and
jsttyplay (<a href="http://encryptio.com" target="_self">encryptio.com</a>).
</p><p>
Playterm is still beta, but it's already fully functional.
Currently, we are curious about how many users we can serve, but in terms
of global Linux knowledge, we are very excited. 
At this point, Playterm.org is a nonprofit project to serve the community and spread GNU Linux knowledge.
Hopefully, it will inspire youngsters to use the shell more often.

I may not be Steven Spielberg, but every time I see a rerun of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Gumby</em></span>,
I'm convinced I could be a famous producer. With Linux, I don't even have
to get a fancy movie set. I can make my own science-fiction adventure
film with nothing more than a Webcam and a streak of bizarre creativity.

Stopmotion is a Linux program designed for creating stop-motion
films. It's available for most distributions and easily compilable
for the rest. Stopmotion is simple in its design, and it allows you 
either to import a series of pre-taken photos or take live stop-action
with a Webcam. I find the latter to be slightly easier, as you can see
a ghost image of the last shot you took, making the slight changes you
need easy to spot.
</p><p>
Recording stop-motion films is tedious work, but the end result
can be pretty cool. Check out the homepage, short-linked here:
<a href="http://is.gd/stopmotion" target="_self">is.gd/stopmotion</a>. If you create an interesting video,
send a link to <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. If we get enough, we'll post them on our Web site.

One of our favorite things to do over at LinuxJournal.com is to check the
pulse of the Linux community and our readership. We do this fairly
regularly with simple polls on our site. These give us valuable insight
into your interests, and they give us a fun way to get feedback on a
specific question. Sometimes a simple question generates a tremendous
amount of discussion, and even a little controversy. We recently asked
readers to choose their favorite programming language, and we received a lot of
great answers. Check it out at
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/whats-your-favorite-programming-language" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/whats-your-favorite-programming-language</a>.
</p><p>
We know that for some of you, your favorite programming
language is such an important part of your existence that you are
understandably quite opinionated on the subject. So, as you might expect,
there were clear leaders and underdogs, as well as passionate supporters of
each.
</p><p>
Python tends to be the favorite among our readers, and it has won more than
one Readers' Choice Award for favorite programming language. Indeed,
Python has staying power, as it once again was the leading choice among
LinuxJournal.com readers with 24% of the votes. Not surprisingly, there
were many skeptics among the commenters, but Python fans did their best to
set everyone straight about Python's virtues, and one reader offered this sage advice:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
In my opinion, a large Python system is well organized (like any
language), sticks to standards, has docs (particularly module docs) and
has tests. Consistent, well-written Python code makes it fairly obvious
what objects/types functions accept and return, and having useful standard
types (lists, dics, sets, etc.) encourages people not to make exotic
variations often. Having module docs that document what your function does
and its inputs and outputs clarify any questions.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In a close second and third place were C and C++, respectively. Both had
enthusiastic support in the comments section, and we can infer from some
comments that &ldquo;all of the above&rdquo; (in the case of C, C++ and
Python)
might have been a popular answer as well. Many indicated a preference for
different languages for different tasks, and we applaud their versatility
and open-mindedness!
</p><p>
Java trailed C++ in fourth place, and it was cited more than once as a
preferred learning and teaching language. It probably also is safe to bet
that some of Java's popularity is due to the increasing demand for
Android applications written in Java. One anonymous commenter gave us a
detailed breakdown of how Java fits the bill versus other
languages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
For fun: Forth.

Although these may not suit everyone, I have to give credit for such a
detailed response.

Getting a little less love were Perl, C# and Ruby. Although these all have
devoted followings, their fans were largely outnumbered in this poll. I
was a little surprised to see Ruby score only 4% of the votes, as I
personally know so many enthusiastic Ruby coders. 
</p><p>
Haskell and OCaml each got 1% of the vote, while the catchall
&ldquo;other&rdquo; made up the remaining 8%. Most interesting were the
comments describing the variety of languages our readers use regularly as
well as dabble in.
</p><p>
PHP always has a few fans, and although we can argue that PHP belongs in a
separate &ldquo;scripting languages&rdquo; poll, its fans still showed support.
The same can be said for JavaScript and Bash, both of which got a little
love from our readers. Perhaps we'll do a favorite scripting language
poll soon, but in the meantime, since PHP, JavaScript and Bash tend to be
part of my daily life, it is nice to see I am not alone.
</p><p>
There were quite a few mentions of Scala, LISP and Erlang, as well as
oldies but goodies, FORTRAN and Cobol. The latter occasionally
were mentioned in the context of &ldquo;getting old&rdquo;, but frankly, do the
classics ever go out of style?
</p><p>
It is always fun to read the nostalgia posts that inevitably appear on
these sorts of comment threads. When programmers share their stories,
there is usually a mention of the language they started with, and when our
readers share stories of the language they were using in 1976 or even 1968,
it gives us all a glimpse at where we've been, and how we all got to
where we are today. Whether you started as a mainframe pioneer or a geeky
kid typing out rudimentary BASIC on your TI-99/4A (What? Bill Cosby said
it was cool!), you've likely had a somewhat meandering journey made up
of more than a few languages to get to the code you write today. In my
humble opinion, sharing these stories is one of the best parts of
LinuxJournal.com. I hope you'll all join in the fun and check out the
current poll next time you visit LinuxJournal.com. Don't be shy! Tell
us your stories and opinions in the comments. You never know who you may
inspire. I suspect it might be me!
