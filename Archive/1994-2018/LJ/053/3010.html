    A look at a new tool for visualizations of scientific
    data&mdash;VTK, an object-oriented visual toolkit.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a9500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Most scientists and engineers are adept
at approaching and solving problems. If they use the scientific
method, they may even get the right answer. However, analyzing
results and measurements is often difficult because visualization
tools are lacking. If your experience has been like mine, the tools
for investigating data are either too specialized
(<span   class="bold"><b>vis5d</b></span>), too weak
(<span   class="bold"><b>plotmtv</b></span>) or too expensive
(<span   class="bold"><b>AVS</b></span>). While good commercial
packages exist such as Tecplot from Amtec Engineering, they often
place restrictions (such as no remote displays in X) and
constrictions on the user.
</p><p>To solve this problem, three very intelligent men put their
heads together (for nine months before coding began) and wrote The
Visualization Toolkit (VTK). Will Schroeder, Bill Lorensen and Ken
Martin have created one of the best systems available for
performing scientific visualization. It is far and away the best
value to be found today.</p><p>In this article, I will briefly describe what is required to
obtain, compile and use VTK. The goal is to leave you with a sense
of the scope of VTK and the level of commitment required to use it.
You probably won't be able to immediately start creating
visualization pipelines; however, you will have a good idea of the
range of problems it is suited to solve and what will be required
of you to solve them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a97c0"></a>Overview</h2></div></div><p>VTK is a collection of visualization &ldquo;objects&rdquo; which can be
connected to make a visualization pipeline. VTK strictly follows
the object-oriented model, whereby there is a hierarchy of objects,
and any object which is a &ldquo;sub-object&rdquo; of another inherits the
parent object's methods and properties. Objects are also broken
down into &ldquo;classes&rdquo; which represent the authors' best estimate of
the most effective set of tools required to put together a
visualization. The objects are broken down into 14 categories by
function: Foundation, Cells, Datasets, Pipeline, Sources, Filters,
Mappers, Reader/Writer/Importer/Exporter, Graphics, Volume
Rendering, Imaging, OpenGL Renderer, Tcl/Tk and Window-System
Specific. The user will most often be concerned with Dataset,
Pipeline, Sources, Filters, Reader/Writers and Graphics and/or
Imaging or Volume Rendering, though the other classes are
implicitly used in most cases.</p><p>With these classes, we have the ability to construct a
&ldquo;pipeline&rdquo; which reads or creates data, filters it as required,
and finally renders it on the screen or exports the rendering to a
file. While the classes follow the object model, the pipelines are
procedural, which is most often needed when reducing data. The
pipeline starts with a source (data), is operated on by any number
of filters (even recursively) and is finally presented as output.
The &ldquo;data&rdquo; source may be unstructured points, structured points,
structured grid, unstructured grid, rectilinear grid or polygonal
data. The class of data determines the types of filters which may
be used to operate on the data, with the more structured data
having the most filters available. For example, unstructured points
may not be contoured, but they can be remapped to a structured
points set, which can be contoured. Armed with these tools, all
that is required to visualize almost any data is a sound approach
to reducing it. With the ability to visualize data well in hand,
the rate limiting step is now relegated to performance, and it can
be a big issue. Datasets can easily get quite large or require a
lot of computational effort to manipulate. VTK has tools to deal
with these issues as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a9920"></a>Using VTK</h2></div></div><p>To start, I recommend the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Visualization
Toolkit</em></span>, Second Edition, by Will Schroeder, Ken Martin
and Bill Lorensen, published by Prentice Hall. It is an invaluable
reference for understanding both the visualization process and VTK.
After you've read the terse (yet complete) man pages, you'll
understand why the book is needed.</p><p>All of the following examples were created using the Tcl/Tk
bindings to VTK. These examples can also be created in C++, Python
or Java; the latter two are relatively new to VTK, so your mileage
may vary. Some examples were borrowed with permission from the VTK
distribution, and all are biased toward reduction of computational
data as opposed to imaging data or graphics applications.</p><p>Often, the first thing we ask to see when we have a large
dataset is &ldquo;Where is the data?&rdquo; A simple enough request, but most
tools will not easily give it to you. Let's say we have
smooth-particle hydrodynamics code which uses and generates
unstructured points. For each point, we have the x, y and z
coordinates as well as several scalar values (for now, tensor
components will be considered scalars).</p><p>While not the most memory-efficient, one way to &ldquo;see&rdquo; the
particles is to place glyphs at every particle position, scaled by
the particle size. The visualization pipeline must take in the
point data, create a glyph object and place one at each point
location, scaled by the particle size. The set of glyphs must then
be rendered on the screen. <a href="3010l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a> is the Tcl version of the code to do that, assuming you
have read the point positions into the arrays
<b  >xpos</b>, <b  >ypos</b> and
<b  >zpos</b> and the radius into
<b  >rad</b>.</p><p><a href="3010f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Spherical Glyphs Scaled Relative to Particle
Size</b></span></a></p><p>When this pipeline is run, a visualization window is opened
on the desktop with a spherical glyph centered at the location of
each point and a radius equal to the particle size (see Figure 1).
Objects which are implicitly included in the scene but not listed
above can be specified if required. These include lights, cameras
and object properties. The implicitly defined objects are also
accessible and controllable through their &ldquo;parent&rdquo; object; in
this case, the renderer. In Tcl, a handy command is available from
the VTK shell called <b  >ListMethods</b> that informs
you of all methods (and the number of arguments) available for any
object. Adding the command <b  >ren&nbsp;ListMethods</b>
to Listing 1 would return the information that about 60 methods are
available to you. After using this command on several objects, you
will begin to see a structure to the methods and develop a sense of
how the objects fit together.</p><p>With the addition of Tk entry boxes, all controllable
attributes of all objects can be controlled interactively. However,
changes to the pipeline will be seen only when the pipeline is
re-executed with the new value and an
<span   class="bold"><b>Update</b></span> is requested. This can be
handled either by setting all attributes in a procedure called from
the Tk interface or by attaching the method to the &ldquo;command&rdquo;
argument of the widget that sets the value of the attribute. I
recommend the former method.</p><p>The main access to the visible attributes of the scene is
through the <b  >Actor</b> objects and the
<b  >Mapper</b> objects. Attributes, such as visibility,
color, opacity, specular reflectance, specular power and
representation (wireframe, points, surfaces), are set with the
<b  >vtkProperty</b> object that is automatically created
for the <b  >vtkActor</b>, if one is not explicitly
defined.</p><p>Now, let's say you want to evaluate a mesh created with an
automatic mesh generator, and furthermore, you want to tag the cell
with the smallest spacing. Starting with the nodes and connectivity
list, the &ldquo;mesh&rdquo; can be built by connecting the connected nodes
with line segments and placing a geometric object at each of the
nodes containing the shortest and longest connection.
<a href="3010l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> is a &ldquo;quick and dirty&rdquo;
bit of code that took me about 15 minutes to write (well, maybe a
little longer). It assumes the nodal positions are known, and their
right, back and upper neighbors are known and stored in the arrays
<b  >i1tab</b>, <b  >i3tab</b> and
<b  >i8tab</b>, respectively.</p><p><a href="3010f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Mesh
Nodes, Connectivity and Minimum Cell
Dimension</b></span></a></p><p>The code in Listing 2 creates the visualization shown in
Figure 2. This pipeline does not include the code to make the
boundaries visible. We will cover that next. The key features of
this pipeline are the multiple sources (mesh data, sphere)
presented in one scene. The sphere is placed on the node with the
nearest neighbor in one of the three coordinate directions
mentioned above. The polygonal data represented by the
<b  >vtkPolyData</b> object called
<b  >mesh</b> consists of two-point polygons, i.e.,
lines. Polygonal data is often read in with a reader or created
automatically by a source or filter such as the
<b  >vtkSphereSource</b> (Listing 1) or a
<b  >vtkContourFilter</b>. Notice that the mappers for
the mesh and for the sphere are different. The mesh mapper takes
the mesh directly as input, but the sphere mapper operates on the
<b  >vtkSphereSource</b>, which is not
<b  >vtkPolyData</b>. The reason for this is that the
mapper <span   class="emphasis"><em>reads</em></span> <b  >vtkPolyData</b> as
input. The mesh <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
<b  >vtkPolyData</b>. The sphere is a source which can
send out <b  >vtkPolyData</b>, when requested, as we do
when employing the <span   class="bold"><b>GetOutput</b></span>
method on the <b  >vtkSphereSource</b>.</p><p>Satisfied with our mesh, let's look at some data. The
pipeline excerpt in <a href="3010l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a> is
based on the same mesh data as above, but includes methods to show
the boundaries in the model and vector fields. [Complete listings
for this article are available by anonymous download in the file
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue53/3010.tgz.]</p><p>A lot is happening in the pipeline shown in Listing 3. First,
the &ldquo;mesh&rdquo; polydata set gained two attributes: scalars and
vectors (e.g., <b  >SetScalars</b>,
<b  >SetVectors</b>). The vectors were created in a
<b  >vtkFloatVector</b> object. Their magnitudes were
calculated and stored in a <b  >vtkFloatScalar</b> field
called <b  >field</b>. The scalars are used by the mapper
to color the vectors, and the vector data is used by the
<b  >vtkHedgeHog</b> (vector plotter) to create the
oriented and sized vector glyphs. A separate pipeline is used to
draw the surfaces of the object, and a 7-case switch is used to
build the point connectivities for the surface panels per cell. It
takes advantage of any connectivity which may exist on a given cell
and builds a special type of polydata called &ldquo;triangle strips&rdquo;.
Triangle strips allow <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> connected triangles to
be created with <span   class="emphasis"><em>n + 2</em></span> points. The
<b  >vtkPolyData</b> must be told that the given cell
array values are triangle strips in order to properly set up the
connectivity. This is accomplished with the
<span   class="bold"><b>SetStrips</b></span> method, as compared to
<span   class="bold"><b>SetLines</b></span> in the mesh example. The
panels are made transparent by setting the opacity to .5, which
allows the vectors to be seen. The color map for the vectors has
been explicitly set to range between the minimum and maximum
velocity magnitudes. By default, the mapping is red-to-blue from 0
to 1. The <span   class="bold"><b>SetScalarRange</b></span> method
allows the range to be reset in the mapper. Notice the red vectors
in the back left corner of Figure 3&mdash;an error is creeping in from
the boundary and the location where it begins is very clear. Apart
from verifying the correctness of the mesh, boundaries and boundary
conditions, I can easily diagnose trouble spots in the
calculation.</p><p><a href="3010f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Vector plot of fluid velocities colored by magnitude and outer
boundaries visualized with transparency.</b></span></a></p><p>Finally, these last two figures demonstrate some of the
advanced features of VTK. Figure 4 is a BMRT-rendered (Blue Moon
Rendering Tool) export from VTK. The complex shapes were built
entirely from contoured implicit functions. Figure 5 is from the
VTK examples directory and shows streamlines emanating from
&ldquo;seeds&rdquo; that are located at a heater vent.</p><p><a href="3010f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. A

from the VTK sample suite. This visualization includes streamlines
flow colored by temperature.</b></span></a></p><p>While this treatment only scratches the surface of VTK's
capabilities, you can begin to see the flexibility and power it
affords the user. In addition to the features discussed in this
article, VTK has objects for image analysis and manipulation,
implicit functions, data transformation, data sampling, volume
(solid object) rendering, memory management, texture mapping, data
manipulation and exporting and more. Admittedly, the learning curve
for becoming facile with VTK is somewhat steep, but it pays for
itself many times over in saved time when doing complex
analyses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a1ac8"></a>Obtaining VTK</h2></div></div><p>The official source code release of VTK is available from the
VTK home page at http://www.kitware.com/vtk.html. For the more
daring, almost-daily beta releases are available from
http://www.kitware.com/vtkData/Nightly.html. On the average Linux
system, software required to compile and run VTK includes the
following: C++, OpenGL (or Mesa), tkUnixPort.h (from the Tk source
distribution), Tcl 7.4 or higher, Tk 4.0 or higher. If you plan to
use the Python or Java bindings to VTK, you will need those
packages as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b1580.0x25a1bd0"></a>Compiling VTK</h2></div></div><p>The VTK source code is written entirely in C++, and as of
version 2.0 with Linux 2.0.31 and either libc5 or libc6, it
compiles successfully without error with Mesa 2.5 and Tcl/Tk 8.0.
In the README file at the top of the distribution, the user will
find all the instructions necessary to do the build. Here's what I
did:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Obtained and compiled Mesa (easy).</p></li><li><p>Retrieved tkUnixPort.h from the Tk source
distribution and placed it in the (vtk_top_dir)/unix/directory (I
used Tcl/Tk 8.0).</p></li><li><p>Ran <b  >./configure --with-mesa --with-tcl
--with-shared --with-tkwidget --with-patented</b></p></li><li><p>Edited user.make to find all the necessary support
files.</p></li><li><p>Ran <b  >make</b>.</p></li><li><p>Ran <b  >make install</b> (optional; run
only if you have the disk space).</p></li></ol></div><p>Many more configuration options are available and can be seen
by typing <b  >./configure --help</b>. I had trouble with
the Python and Java bindings. The build, as configured above, takes
about an hour on a Pentium-Pro 200MHz machine.</p><p>Many examples are available to test the installation in the
(vtk_top_dir)/[graphics|imaging|patented|contrib]/examples[Cxx|tcl|Python]
directories. Most imaging examples require the vtkdata archive to
also be located at the VTK home site. Graphics examples will, for
the most part, run as is. For the C++ examples, compile with
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> and run. Tcl examples can be
run by typing the following from the Tcl examples directory:
<b  >../../tcl/vtk
<i><tt>example_file</tt></i>.tcl</b>, or, if vtk
has been installed, <b  >vtk
<i><tt>example_file</tt></i>.tcl</b>. Examples
employing the <b  >TkRenderWidget</b> object cause a
segmentation fault when using the XFree SVGA server, but work with
the S3 server. (I haven't tested others.) Fortunately,
<b  >TkRenderWidget</b> is not required for any
visualization pipeline; you can't embed the render window in a Tk
window. However, this problem will likely be solved by the time you
read this article.</p></div></div>
