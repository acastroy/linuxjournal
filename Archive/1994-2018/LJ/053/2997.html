    In this article Alessandro will show the design and
    implementation of a custom audio device, paying particular
    attention to the software driver. The driver, as usual, is
    developed as a kernel module. Even though Linux 2.2 will be
    out by the time you read this, the software described here
    works only with Linux 2.0 and the first few decades of 2.1
    versions.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2512580.0x260a4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>I'm a strange guy, and I want my
computers to keep silent&mdash;that's why I wrote the &ldquo;Visible-bell
mini-howto&rdquo;, where I suggest speakerectomy surgery be performed.
On the other hand, I enjoy playing with the soldering iron to build
irrelevant stuff. One of the most irrelevant things I ever
conceived is recycling the computer's loudspeaker in a
very-low-volume audio device. As you might imagine, the device
plugs in the parallel port.
</p><p>This article describes the driver for such a beast, shows
interesting details of the kernel workings and is still short
enough to be an easy text for almost any reader. A quick
description of the hardware is mandatory, but you can safely skip
over the first section and jump directly to the section called
&ldquo;Writing Data&rdquo;.</p><p>The software described here, as well as the electrical
drawing, is released according to the GPL and is available as
sad-1.0.tar.gz (Standalone Audio Device) from
ftp://ftp.systemy.it/pub/develop/, my own ftp site.</p><p>Part of this work has been sponsored by &ldquo;SAD Trasporto
Locale&rdquo; (http://www.sad.it/), the bus company of Bolzano (Bozen),
Italy. They plan to bring my hardware on their buses and renamed
the company to match my package (smile). (See &ldquo;Travelling Linux&rdquo;
by Maurizio Cachia, <i  >LJ</i>, June 1997.)</p><p><a href="2997f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Audio
Device Schematic</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2512580.0x260a818"></a>The Underlying Hardware</h2></div></div><p>My device plugs in the parallel port, and its schematics are
depicted in Figure 1; The photograph under the tiele is the only
model ever built (Italian buses will run a different flavour of
such stuff, the &ldquo;bus for
bus&rdquo;--ftp://ftp.systemy.it/pub/develop/b4b-X.YY.tar.gz).</p><p>I owe the basic idea to Michael Beck, author of the
<span   class="bold"><b>pcsndrv</b></span> package; the idea sounds
like &ldquo;use the parallel data bits to output audio samples.&rdquo; My own
addition is &ldquo;use the interrupt signal to strobe samples at the
right pace.&rdquo; Audio samples must flow at 8KHz and any
not-so-ancient computer can sustain such an interrupt rate: my
almost-ancient development box runs a 33 BogoMips processor and is
perfectly happy playing parallel audio. The interrupt-based
approach trades higher quality for increased hardware complexity
than that needed by Michael's package.</p><p>As shown in the schematics, the device is made up of a simple
D/A converter built with a few resistors; the signal is then
reduced to 1.5V peak-to-peak amplitude and fed through a low-pass
filter. The filter I chose is a switched-capacitor device driven by
a square wave at ten times the cutoff frequency. The 6142 chip is a
dual op-amp with rail-to-rail output, one of several possible
choices for low-power single-supply equipment.</p><p>The output signal can be brought to a small loudspeaker, but
can be listened to only in complete silence; other environments ask
for some form of amplification. My preferred alternative to the
amplifier is the oscilloscope, the typical hear-by-seeing
approach.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2512580.0x260aa80"></a>Writing Data</h2></div></div><p>The main role of an audio driver is pushing data through the
audio device. Several kinds of audio devices exist, and the
<span   class="bold"><b>sad</b></span> driver only implements the
/dev/audio flavour: 8-bit samples flowing at a rate of 8KHz. Each
data byte that gets written to /dev/audio should be fed to an 8-bit
A/D converter; every 125 microseconds, a new data sample must
replace the current one.</p><p>Timing issues should be managed by the driver, without
intervention from the program writing out the audio data. The
output buffer is the software tool that isolates timing issues from
user programs.</p><p>In <span   class="bold"><b>sad</b></span>, the output buffer is
allocated at load time using
<span   class="bold"><b>get_free_pages</b></span>. This function
allocates consecutive pages, a power of two of them; the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>order</em></span> argument of the function specifies how
many pages are requested and is used as a power of two. An
<span   class="emphasis"><em>order</em></span> of 1, therefore, represents two pages
and an <span   class="emphasis"><em>order</em></span> of 3 represents eight pages. The
allocation order of the output buffer is stored in the macro
<b  >OBUFFER_ORDER</b>, which is <b  >0</b> in
the distributed source file. This accounts for one page, which on
the x86 processor corresponds to 4KB, or half a second worth of
data.</p><p>The output buffer of sad is a circular buffer; the pointers
<b  >ohead</b> and <b  >otail</b> represent its
starting and ending points. The kernel uses unsigned long values to
represent physical addresses, and the same convention is used in
sad:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static unsigned long obuffer = 0;
static unsigned long volatile ohead, otail;
</pre><p>Note that the <b  >ohead</b> and
<b  >otail</b> variables are declared as volatile to
prevent the compiler from caching their value in processor
registers. This is an important caution, as the variables will be
modified at interrupt time, asynchronously with respect to the rest
of the code.
</p><p>We'll see later that sad has an input buffer as well; the
overall buffer allocation consists of these lines, executed from
within <span   class="bold"><b>init_module</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
obuffer = __get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL,
   OBUFFER_ORDER, 0 /* no dma */);
ohead = otail = obuffer;
ibuffer = __get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL,
   IBUFFER_ORDER, 0 /* no dma */);
ihead = itail = ibuffer;
if (!ibuffer || !obuffer) { /* allocation failed
                             */
cleanup_module(); /* use your own function */
return -ENOMEM;
}
</pre><p>Any data that a process writes to the device is put in the
circular buffer, as long as it fits. When the buffer is full, the
writing process is put to sleep, waiting for some space to be
freed.
</p><p>Since the data samples flow out smoothly, the process will
eventually be awakened to complete its
<span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span> system call. Anyway, a good
driver is prepared to deal with users hitting the
<b  >ctrl-C</b> and must deal with
<b  >SIGINT</b> and other signals.</p><p>The following lines are needed to put to sleep and awaken the
current process, all the magic is hidden in
<span   class="bold"><b>interruptible_sleep_on</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
while (OBUFFER_FREE &lt; OBUFFER_THRESHOLD) {
   interruptible_sleep_on(&amp;outq);
   if (current-&gt;signal &amp; ~current-&gt;blocked)
       /* tell the fs layer to handle it */
      /* a signal arrived */
      return -ERESTARTSYS;
/* else, loop */
}
/* the following code writes to
 * the circular buffer */
</pre><p>What are <b  >OBUFFER_FREE</b> and
<b  >OBUFFER_THRESHOLD</b>? They are two macros: the
former accesses <span   class="emphasis"><em>ohead</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>otail</em></span> to find out how much free space is in
the buffer; the latter is a simple constant, predefined to 1024, a
pseudo-random number. The role of such a threshold is to preserve
system resources by avoiding too frequent
asleep<b  >-&gt;</b>awake transitions.
</p><p>If the threshold was 1, the process would need to be awakened
as soon as one byte of the buffer was freed, but it would soon be
put to sleep again. As a result, the process will always be
running, consuming processing power and raising the machine load. A
threshold of 1KB assures that when the process goes to sleep it
will sleep for at least one tenth of a second, because it won't be
awakened before 1KB of data flows through the audio device. You can
recompile sad.c with a different threshold value to see how a small
value keeps the processor busy. Too big a value can result in jumpy
audio, i.e. the sound cuts in and out. The audio stream becomes
jumpy because data continues to flow while the kernel schedules
execution of the process writing audio data. The more heavily the
computer is loaded, the more jumpy the audio is likely to be; if
several processes are contending for the processor, the one playing
audio might be awakened too late, after all pending data has been
transferred to the audio device. In addition to lowering the wakeup
threshold, you can also cure the problem by increasing the buffer
size.</p><p>Naturally, the <span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span> device
method is only half of the story; the other half is performed by
the interrupt handler.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2512580.0x260b840"></a>The Interrupt Handler</h2></div></div><p>In sad, audio samples are strobed out by a hardware
interrupt, which is reported to the processor every 125
microseconds. Each interrupt gets services by an ISR (interrupt
service routine, also called &ldquo;interrupt handler&rdquo;), written in C.
I won't go into the details of registering interrupt handlers here,
as they have already been described in other &ldquo;Kernel Korner&rdquo;
columns.</p><p>Managing several thousand interrupts per second is a
non-negligible load for the processor (at least for slow processors
like mine), so the driver only enables interrupt reporting when the
device is opened and disables it on the last
<span   class="bold"><b>close</b></span>.</p><p>What I'd like to show here is how data flows to the A/D
converter. The code is quite easy, and the
<b  >OBUFFER_THRESHOLD</b> constant appears again, as
expected:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (!OBUFFER_EMPTY) { /* send a sample */
   OUTBYTE(*((u8 *)otail++));
   if (otail == obuffer + OBUFFER_SIZE)
      otail = obuffer; /* wrap */
   if (OBUFFER_FREE &gt; OBUFFER_THRESHOLD)
      wake_up_interruptible(&amp;outq);
   return;
}
wake_up_interruptible(&amp;closeq);
</pre><p>As usual, every code snippet introduces new questions; this
time you might wonder about <b  >OUTBYTE</b> and
<b  >closeq</b>. The latter item is the main topic of the
next section, while <b  >OUTBYTE</b> hides the line of
code that pushes a data sample to the D/A converter.
</p><p>The macro is defined earlier in sad.c as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define OUTBYTE(b) outb(convert(b), sad_base)
</pre><p>Here, <b  >sad_base</b> is the processor port used
to send data to the parallel interface (usually 0x378), and
<b  >convert</b> is a simple mathematical conversion that
turns the data byte as stored in the audio-file format to a linear
0-255 value, more suited to the D/A converter.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2512580.0x26026a8"></a>Blocking Close</h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>close</b></span> system call, like
<span   class="bold"><b>read</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span>, is one of those calls that
can block. For example, when you are done with the floppy drive,
<span   class="bold"><b>close</b></span> blocks waiting for any data
to be flushed to the physical device. This behaviour can be
verified by running:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
strace cp /boot/vmlinux /dev/fd0
</pre><p>Audio devices are somewhat similar to the floppy drive: a
program writing audio data closes the file after the last
<span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span> system call. However, this
means only that data has been transferred to the output buffer,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> that everything has necessarily already
flown to the loudspeaker. An implementation that blocks on close
can be helpful, when you want to do this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat file.au &gt; /dev/sad &amp;&amp; echo done
</pre>


On the other hand, sometimes you'll prefer to stop playing sounds
when the process closes the device. For example, if you play the
piano on your keyboard, the sound should stop as soon as you raise
the key, even if the program has already pushed extra data to the
output buffer.
</p><p>For this reason, the sad module implements two device entry
points, one that blocks on close and one that doesn't block. Minor
number 0 is the blocking device and minor number 1 is the
non-blocking one. The entry points in /dev are created by the
script that loads the module, included in the sad distribution:
/dev/sad is the one that blocks on close and /dev/sadnb is the
non-blocking one.</p><p>While real device drivers often offer configuration options
(such as choosing whether or not to block on close) through the
<span   class="bold"><b>ioctl</b></span> system call, I chose to
offer different entry points in /dev, because this way I can use
normal shell redirection to perform my tasks, without the need to
write C code to perform the relevant ioctl call. The close method
in sad.c, therefore, looks like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (MINOR(inode-&gt;i_rdev)==0) /* wait */
   interruptible_sleep_on(&amp;closeq);
else {
   unsigned long flags; /* drop data */
   save_flags(flags);
   cli(); ohead=otail;
   restore_flags(flags);
}
MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT;
if (!MOD_IN_USE)
   SAD_IRQOFF(); /* disable irq */
return;
</pre><p>Actually, there is a third possibility as far as
<span   class="bold"><b>close</b></span> is concerned: go on playing
in the background as long as some data is there, even after the
program has closed the audio device. This approach is left as an
exercise to the reader, because I prefer having a chance to
actively stop any device making noise.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2512580.0x2602cd8"></a>Reading Data</h2></div></div><p>Usually, a device can be read from as well as written to.
Reading /dev/audio usually returns digitized data from a
microphone, but I haven't been asked to provide this feature, and I
have no real interest in hearing my voice.</p><p>When I built my first alpha release of the physical device, I
found the need to time the interrupt rate, in order to be sure it
was close enough to the expected 8KHz. (In the alpha version, I
used a variable resistor to fine-tune the frequency, and I needed a
way to check how it went.) The easiest solution that came to mind
was to use the clock of the host computer to measure the time
lapses.</p><p>To this end, I modified the interrupt handler so that it
would write timestamps to an input buffer whenever the device was
being read. The input buffer is a circular buffer just like the
output buffer described above.</p><p>The previous excerpt from sad_interrupt showed that after
writing an audio sample, the function returns to the caller. Any
additional lines, therefore, are only executed if no audio data is
there, so the rest of the ISR has thus been devoted to collecting
timing information. This shows how I implemented &ldquo;if there is no
pending output, deal with input&rdquo; rather than the more correct &ldquo;if
something is reading, give it some data.&rdquo; This is acceptable as
long as the device is not meant to be read from and written to at
the same time in a production environment.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static struct timeval tv, tv_last;
unsigned long diff;
do_gettimeofday(&amp;tv);
diff = (tv.tv_sec - tv_last.tv_sec) * 1000000 +
   (tv.tv_usec - tv_last.tv_usec);
tv_last = tv;
/* Write 16 bytes, assume bufsize
 * is a multiple of 16 */
ihead += sprintf((char *)ihead,"%15u\n",
            (int)diff);
if (ihead == ibuffer + IBUFFER_SIZE)
   ihead = ibuffer; /* wrap */
wake_up_interruptible(&amp;inq); /*
        anyone reading? */
</pre><p>Printing the time difference between two samples has two
advantages over printing the absolute time: data is directly
meaningful to humans without resorting to external filters, and any
overflow of the input buffer will have no effect on the perceived
results, other than the loss of a few samples.
</p><p>Real tests show the reported interrupt rate is not as steady
as one would hope. Some system activities require you to disable
interrupt reporting, and this introduces some delay in the
execution of the ISR routine. Nonetheless, an oscillation of a few
microseconds is perfectly acceptable and it is not perceived in the
resulting audio, which is not high-fidelity anyway.</p><p>It's interesting to note that disk activity can introduce
some real distortion in the audio stream, since servicing an IDE
interrupt can take as long as two milliseconds (on my system). The
IDE driver disables interrupt reporting while its own ISR is
active, and the huge delay results in eight lost interrupts from
the parallel port, which in turn causes a noticeable distortion of
the audio data stream.</p><p>If you read from sad during disk activity, you'll see the
long time intervals; writing to the device produces very bad audio.
The easy solution to this problem is invoking</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/hdparm -u 1 /dev/hda
</pre><p>before playing any audio. The command tells the disk drive
not to disable reporting interrupts while it is servicing its own.
Refer to the <span   class="bold"><b>hdparm</b></span> documentation
to probe further.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2512580.0x26031a8"></a>Other Device Methods</h2></div></div><p>The device driver interface offers other device methods in
addition to the <span   class="bold"><b>open/close</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>read/write</b></span> pairs. While none of
them is critical to device operation, I usually add a few lines of
code to implement <span   class="bold"><b>select</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>lseek</b></span>. The former is needed by
those programs which multiplex several input/output channels or use
non-blocking operations to read and write data. Its role is quite
needed if you run real programs, and the implementation is
straightforward enough that I won't show it here. The
implementation of lseek, on the other hand, consists of the one
line <b  >return -ESPIPE;</b> and is meant to tell any
program that tries to lseek the device that this &ldquo;is a pipe&rdquo;
(reported to user space as &ldquo;Illegal seek&rdquo;).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2512580.0x2603468"></a>Related Stuff</h2></div></div><p>My aversion to computer sound makes me a novice in the field,
and I really don't know anything about programs that play audio, or
sites where audio files can be retrieved. Although Linus Torvalds
offered an interesting &ldquo;I pronounce Linux as Linux&rdquo;, the file was
not enough to test my device, and I needed to generate some audio
data. The result is the sad distribution includes a program that
plays sinusoidal waves, one that plays square waves and a
not-so-good piano implementation. These tools work with any
/dev/audio you happen to run and can be fun to play with,
especially if you have a scope near your Linux box.</p><p>  All code for the sad program is available by anonymous
