    When you have a slow modem and want faster transfer rates, data
    compression with this program is the answer.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2374f2.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1169580.0x12614a8"></a></h2></div></div><p> Once upon a time there was a frustrated
engineer who needed a faster way to remotely display X clients on
his home PC. He had a new daughter, and very much wished to spend
time with her without driving back and forth to work. One day a
fellow engineer told him about a fantastic little program called
DXPC. Could it be true? Were all of his problems solved? No, but at
least they were improved.
</p><p>DXPC stands for Differential X Protocol Compression. It is a
small client/server program that runs on both sides of a low
bandwidth link (e.g., 28.8K modem PPP link), and is designed to
exploit &ldquo;features&rdquo; in the X protocol to speed up the remote
display of applications across the link. It is capable of
compressing the X messages as much as 10:1. However, not all
messages receive such great performance. Some messages are not
compressed at all. On the average, you can expect as much as 4:1
compression. This sweet little jewel was originally written by
Brian Pane and further developed by Zachary Vonler.</p><p>DXPC employs six different compression techniques. First, it
strips unnecessary data fields. Next, it shrinks fields with a
limited number of possibilities (i.e., Boolean). Using similar
techniques, it shrinks fields that are typically small, while still
handling the cases where they are large. The fourth method uses a
cache on each side of the link to store different command types.
With this cache, instead of transmitting full coordinates, it
transmits a much smaller differential value based on the previously
sent command. Additionally, a cache of the last six deltas is
stored so that it can do further encoding based on a pattern of
deltas. Lastly, DXPC caches large blocks of data that are
transmitted more than once (e.g., X resources). DXPC also employs a
text compressor and an image compressor. For a more detailed
description of these techniques, the authors have included a text
file called DESIGN which describes how DXPC works.</p><p>DXPC is a client/server application, but the client and
server are the same executable. The client side is the remote site
or the site where the X applications are executed. The server side
is the local site or the site where the X application is displayed.
You must be able to compile DXPC and run it on the remote site and
the local site. Fortunately, the authors have done most of the
porting work for you. DXPC uses
<span   class="bold"><b>autoconf</b></span> and will compile on most
UNIX platforms right out of the &ldquo;box&rdquo;. Additionally, there are
ports to Win32 and OS/2. I compiled it for Red Hat Intel Linux
(local) and Solaris 2.5.1 (remote) without a hitch. Well, one speed
bump; I had to add the options
<b  >-lnsl&nbsp;-lsocket</b> to the LIBS line in the
Makefile for Solaris. I have sent this little gnat to the authors,
so hopefully it will be fixed in the 3.6 release.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2374f1.large.jpg"><img src="2374f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Client/Server Configuration
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1169580.0x1261920"></a>Install</h2></div></div><p>Perform the steps below on both your local station and on the
remote site. Once you have completed this, you are ready to
go.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xzvf dxpc-3.5.0.tar.gz
cd dxpc-3.5.0
./configure # optionally add --prefix=/home/bubba
make
make install
make install.man
</pre><p>Now the moment of triumph&mdash;let's look at an example. At work,
you have a Sun box running Solaris. On this machine, named
<span   class="emphasis"><em>workhog</em></span>, you normally run some expensive CAE
(Common Applications Environment) tools that are not available for
Linux. (If only these vendors realized the power of Linux.) At
home, you have a Linux box named <span   class="emphasis"><em>linuxrules</em></span>
that you want to be able to use for more than Quake and Netscape.
You have already compiled and installed DXPC on both machines, and
are sitting at home wanting to do some work. You boot up
<span   class="emphasis"><em>linuxrules</em></span>, and establish a PPP connection
across that pathetic 28.8K modem to <span   class="emphasis"><em>workhog</em></span>.
On the screen are two xterms, or rxvts. One xterm is attached to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>linuxrules</em></span>, the other to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>workhog</em></span>.
</p><p>Inside the <span   class="emphasis"><em>workhog</em></span> xterm, type the
following three simple commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
setenv DISPLAY linuxrules:0.0
dxpc -f -s1
setenv DISPLAY unix:8
</pre><p>Then, in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>linuxrules</em></span> xterm, type this
one simple command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
dxpc -f workhog -s1
</pre>


Now you are ready to go. In the <span   class="emphasis"><em>workhog</em></span> xterm,
start your very expensive CAE tool. Suddenly, it's as if your modem
has turned into a T1 line. Well, not quite, but hopefully it is
faster than before and fast enough to be useful. The
<b  >-s1</b> argument is optional and will report level 1
statistics on the compression ratio. There is also a level 2
statistics argument, <b  >-s2</b>, which prints
statistics on all message types sent.

cannot be done by hardware compression in the modem. In fact, I
believe it complements other compression techniques to increase
overall performance. The authors have done an excellent job of
developing and maintaining a stable, easily compiled and easy to
use program. I wish I had found it a year ago. Please note that if
you use X authority with a .Xauthority file, some extra steps are
necessary to use DXPC. These steps are covered in the README file
distributed with the source.</p><p>Brian Pane informs me that they are preparing to release DXPC
3.6.0 soon. He has added compression for more X messages.</p><p><a href="2374s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
