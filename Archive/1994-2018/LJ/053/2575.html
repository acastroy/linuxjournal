is an impressive book by any measure. Numbering a hefty 1073 pages,
it covers shells, editors and tools such as AWK, sed and RCS. The
primary authors are Jerry Peek, Tim O'Reilly and Mike Loukides, but
the book is made up of hundreds of individual articles by many
different people, including UNIX luminaries Tom Christiansen and
Simson Garfinkel.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Power Tools</em></span> supplies many hints on
how to save typing time by teaching you how to better use your
shell interactively, how to take advantage of your editor and how
to program scripts.</p><p>Using the shell interactively is becoming a bit of a black
art. Luckily, <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Power Tools</em></span> covers
everything you need to know about this subject. Here are a few
examples from the book to give you an idea of what it covers.
First, here is how to edit three existing files: afile, bfile and
cfile:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
emacs [a-c]file
</pre><p>Many people already know how to do this; however, it works
only if the files already exist. Lesser known is what to do if the
files don't already exist. In this case, you edit all three at once
by using:
<pre     class="programlisting">
emacs {a,b,c}file
</pre>


With this information, it's easy to figure out how to make backup
files:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp filename{,.bak}
</pre>


This command will copy the filename to filename.bak. Here's how to
use this same idea to print six files or more:
<pre     class="programlisting">
lpr /usr3/hannah/training/{ed,vi,mail}/lab.{ms,out}
</pre>


Are you confused by the <span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span>
command? You won't have any problems after reading Chapter 17,
which has 24 pages devoted to find. File permissions and processes
are also covered in depth in their own chapters. Even wild cards
get their own chapter. Whole chapters are also devoted to printing,
terminal and serial line settings. (The book includes a great
explanation of termcap and terminfo.)
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> is given two large
chapters, while Emacs is relegated to being &ldquo;the other editor&rdquo;
and given a scant ten pages. The vi coverage probably includes
everything you'll ever need to know about it, while the Emacs
section basically covers a few timesavers and the most essential
commands, such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ESC-x psychoanalyze-pinhead
</pre><p>Missing from the book, though, is my favorite Emacs
amusement:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ESC-9 ESC-x hanoi
</pre>


The important thing to keep in mind is no matter what level of UNIX
or Linux expertise you have now, you can learn much more. Some of
the hints are beginner-oriented, but some may have even the most
experienced user saying, &ldquo;Hey, I never knew that...&rdquo;
</p><p>Here's a question for you. How do you run a program, while
routing the standard error through a pipe to the mail program and
leaving standard output on your screen under a Bourne shell? The
answer is simple:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(program 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;3 3&gt;&amp;-) | mail ockman &amp;
</pre><p>Although bash and tcsh get special mention (as well as the
more generic Bourne shell family and csh), the most powerful shell,
zsh, is left out. Since so much of the book is devoted to shells,
this is bothersome. Anyone who is really interested in having the
most &ldquo;power&rdquo; will choose zsh. Still, since zsh is largely a
superset of the other shells, almost all of the tips are still
helpful.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> is covered fairly
extensively, and <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> is covered
sufficiently. Besides, in my opinion, all you need to know about
sed and awk these days is that you use
<span   class="bold"><b>s2p</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>a2p</b></span> respectively to translate your
code to Perl. Speaking of Perl, the book has a few essays on why
you should learn Perl, but offers no real help in doing so. It does
offer the good recommendation of buying other O'Reilly books on the
subject.</p><p>This book also does not cover networking or the X Window
System, but that's good, because it leaves space for more important
things. Nor, unfortunately, does it particularly make mention of
Linux, although almost all information in the book holds true for
Linux.</p><p>The book includes a CD-ROM of programs. Many of these
programs are probably already installed on your Linux system, but
you'll find quite a few others that will be useful. All of the
programs are discussed in the text of the book. The CD includes
source code and binaries for both Intel Linux and a handful of UNIX
platforms. It does not make it clear which license the various
programs fall under.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Power Tools</em></span> is highly recommended.
It's yet another amazing book from O'Reilly. After digesting all
one thousand pages, you will be a wizard on the command
line.</p></div></div>
