    Here's a look at notation editors for producing sheet music
    under Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b4580.0x25ac558"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you are a musician, you can only cry
about the lack of music programs which run under Linux. Yes, there
are many CD players and sound editors. However, when it comes to
notation programs for producing printed sheet music, your choices
are severely limited. My search for notation editors has turned up
three choices: Rosegarden, TeX music systems and MUP (music
publisher).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b4580.0x25ac660"></a>Rosegarden</h2></div></div><p>The graphical program Rosegarden
(http://www.bath.ac.uk/~masjpf/rose.html) is a very interesting
program which tries its best to do everything. It has a notation
editor which handles most of the normal editing functions, a MIDI
sequencer which will play music from the notation editor as well as
record data from a MIDI keyboard, and the ability to import MIDI
files and convert them to notation&mdash;sounds wonderful.
Unfortunately, Rosegarden is a work in progress and simply doesn't
do all it is supposed to do, or does them awkwardly.</p><p>I have been unable to get the sequencer to work using my
Gravis Ultra sound card, and I find that the notation editor is
tedious to use, since there are no keyboard accelerators for
entering note data. In addition, there is no easy way to print
music. Rosegarden does have the option of exporting files in
MusicTeX, OpusTeX and PMX (a preprocessor for MusiXTeX). I tried
some of the combinations, but was not impressed by the
output.</p><p>The biggest problem with Rosegarden (and a lot of other music
editors) is that it works on the music as if it were a long string,
which means changes to the start of the music propagate to the end
of the chart. For example, if in bar one of a piece you have four
quarter notes and you wish to change the first quarter note to two
eighth notes, you change the first quarter to an eighth, then
insert an eighth. When the first change is done, everything to the
right of the edit point is reformatted with the result that none of
the music is now in the correct measure. Of course, inserting the
second eighth fixes this. If you have several staves of music and
you do a few edits, messing up the entire piece is much too
easy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b4580.0x25ac818"></a>TeX</h2></div></div><p>I did not spend much time with any of the various TeX music
systems. I can handle LaTeX for word processing, but the music
variants seemed much too complex to use. All are in a beta state,
and none produced output which looked finished to me.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b4580.0x25ac920"></a>MUP</h2></div></div><p>MUP, at first glance, would probably be the last program to
pick. However, after a fair bit of testing, I have decided to use
it. So far, I'm happy with my choice. Quoting from the user's
manual:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The music publisher program called MUP takes a
text file describing music as input, and generates PostScript
output for printing that music. The input file can be created using
your favorite text editor, or generated from any other source, such
as another program. The input must be written in a special language
designed especially for describing music.</p></blockquote></div><p>Unlike Rosegarden (and the MS Windows offerings), MUP does
not operate in a WYSIWYG environment. As a matter of fact, the MUP
distribution doesn't even have a means of editing music. MUP uses
plain text files with the appearance of source code as its input.
Use vi, Emacs or whatever your flavor of editor is. Process the
file with MUP to create postscript, and finally, print the
postscript file. If you don't have a postscript printer, you'll
need <span   class="bold"><b>ghostscript</b></span> to print things
out, and <span   class="bold"><b>ghostview</b></span> is handy for
screen previews.
</p><p>As an example of how MUP uses lines of text to describe a
piece of music, here are a few bars of music:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
* 1: 8g;c+;e+;g+;g;b&amp;c#+;g+;
* bar
* 1: 8g;b;d+;f+;4g+;g+;
* bar
* 1: 8g;c+;e+;g+;g;b&amp;c#+;e+;
* bar
* 1: 4g+;b;c+;c#+;
* bar
* 1: 4d+;c+;a;f;
* bar
</pre><p>The <b  >1:</b> at the start of each line is the
staff/voice indicator (in this example, it refers to staff 1 and,
since there is no additional argument, voice 1). Following the
staff/voice are the notes for the measure. The first measure has an
eighth note g, eighth note c, etc. The next measure has several
eighth notes as well as two quarter notes. At first this might seem
to be a bit difficult to follow, but with practice it quickly makes
sense. (See Figure 1 for example output.)
</p><p><a href="3056f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Printed Music Image</b></span></a></p><p>A MUP score can contain up to 32 staves of music, each with
two voices. Each voice can have multiple notes (or chords), so
complex arrangements are quite possible. In addition to the actual
staves, you can also include lyrics, musical symbols and other
appropriate items.</p><p>I started to use MUP when I was playing saxophone in a small
combo. We all play from fake-type music (chords, lyrics and the
melody line). Since I'm not the greatest sax player in the world
and find it fairly hard to transpose from C to B flat while sight
reading, I started rewriting the C charts into B flat by hand. I
find anything needing a pen to be tedious, so I was inspired to try
MUP. After doing a few practice charts, I am now able to enter a
page of one-line music with lyrics in about an hour. Since MUP can
produce MIDI files as well, I can create one in the right key for
practicing at home.</p><p>Flushed with the success of doing these simple charts, I
decided to try a more complex task. I also play in a 15-piece dance
band. Most of the music we play is arranged by our leader, but
recently some of the members have been doing some arranging as
well. So, I decided to give it a try. My first arrangement of the
old standard &ldquo;Fever&rdquo; took the better part of two days to
complete&mdash;arranging it for 11 voices on 6 staves. We played it the
other night and I was pleased&mdash;not only was everyone impressed by
the appearance of the charts, it didn't sound bad either. The first
page of the conductor's score is shown in Figure 2. The complete
MUP files for &ldquo;Bye Bye Blackbird&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fever&rdquo; are available by
anonymous download in the file
ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue53/3056.tgz.</p><p><a href="3056f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Conductor's Score</b></span></a></p><p>If you would like to see some of my other arrangements, I
have posted them along with a copy of this article at
http://www.kootenay.com/~bvdpoel/.</p><p>I certainly don't have room in this short article to cover
all the features of a complex program like MUP. A few of the more
useful items I've been using are if/else statements to produce
charts for different instruments, file includes to read in my own
&ldquo;boiler plate&rdquo;, and macros to make my input files easier to
create, read and revise.</p><p>MUP comes complete with a well-written, 99-page user's manual
in PostScript (you'll have to print it out), as well as the same
information in HTML format. Equally impressive is the customer
support available via e-mail. I've sent a number of queries to the
authors and have received courteous, timely replies to each and
every one.</p><p>MUP is not free. You can download a working copy of the
program, the source code and the manual from
http://www.Arkkra.com/. In addition to the pre-compiled package for
Linux, binary packages exist for other x86 UNIX systems capable of
running ELF x86 binaries and a MS-DOS package. Also, the complete,
commented source code is also available. This source should,
according to the authors, compile on any platform with a C
compiler. The Arkkra home site also has a pointer to a Macintosh
port&mdash;this cross-platform support is a nice bonus as part of this
excellent package. The program is a complete working copy&mdash;however,
it prints a &ldquo;this is an unregistered copy&rdquo; watermark on all pages
of the score. MUP registration is only $29 US; paying this gives
you a license which turns off the marks. This is a fairly low price
to pay for such a well thought out program.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>This article was first published in Issue 28 of LinuxGazette.com,
