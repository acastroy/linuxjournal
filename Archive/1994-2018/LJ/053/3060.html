    Have a need to change a file on your web site on a daily or
    monthly
    basis? This month Mr. Lerner tells us how to do it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183f580.0x19374a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The home page of my web browser is set to
http://www.dilbert.com/, home of the famous and funny Dilbert comic
strip. Thanks to the magic of the Internet, I'm able to enjoy
Dilbert's tragicomic humor each morning, just before I start my
workday.
</p><p>The Dilbert web site would not be very useful or interesting
were it not for the creative talents of Scott Adams, Dilbert's
creator. What makes it interesting from a technical perspective is
the way in which the comic is updated automatically each day. Every
morning, the latest comic is automatically placed on the Dilbert
home page, giving millions of fans the chance to see the latest
installment.</p><p>This month, we will examine several ways in which you can
create pages that are automatically updated, so that a user can
discover new content at the same URL each day. We will look at
several different means to the same end, ranging from CGI programs
to <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> jobs, and will even take a
brief look at how to use databases when publishing new
content.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183f580.0x19376b8"></a>Pointing with CGI</h2></div></div><p>For starters, let's assume our web site consists of seven
different pages, one for each day of the week (e.g., file-0.html on
Sunday, through file-6.html on Saturday). How can we configure the
site so that people requesting today.html (or today.pl) will be
shown today's file? In other words, a visitor on Wednesday should
be shown file-3.html when requesting today.html. Such a system
might be appropriate for a school cafeteria, where the food tends
to be the same each day of the week.</p><p>Perhaps the simplest solution is a CGI program, which we will
call today.pl. If we write the program in Perl, we can easily
determine the day of the week using the
<span   class="bold"><b>localtime</b></span> function, which returns
a list of elements describing the current date and time. Using the
sixth element of that list, which indicates the current day of the
week, we can create the correct URL for that day. Finally, we can
use the HTTP &ldquo;Location&rdquo; header to redirect the user's browser to
the correct location.</p><p>A simple implementation of this program is shown in
<a href="3060l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a> The program should seem
familiar to anyone who has written CGI programs. It enables all of
Perl's warning systems: <b  >-w</b> for optional
warnings, <b  >-T</b> for extra security,
<span   class="bold"><b>strict</b></span> for extra compile-time
checking and <span   class="bold"><b>diagnostics</b></span> for more
complete documentation if something fails.</p><p>By using CGI.pm, the standard Perl module for writing CGI
programs, we gain easy access to any input passed by the server, as
well as the various output methods a CGI program might use. Most
CGI programs use the output methods meant for returning HTML to a
user's browser, including sending a MIME &ldquo;Content-type&rdquo; header
indicating the type of content about to be sent&mdash;in our case, we
return a &ldquo;Location&rdquo; header, which removes the need for a
&ldquo;Content-type&rdquo; header.</p><p>If the above program is installed as /cgi-bin/today.pl on our
server, visitors will always be greeted with the appropriate file
for the current day of the week.</p><p>The above program, simple as it is, has several flaws. Most
significantly, CGI is slow and inefficient; using it to redirect
the user's browser to another file will slow down the user's
experience, as well as increase the load on your server. Each time
a CGI program is invoked, the server must create a new process. If
the program is written in Perl, this means the Perl binary must be
started, which can take some time.</p><p>One solution might be to use
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span>, which inserts a fully
working version of Perl into the Apache web server. Using mod_perl
means Apache no longer needs to create a new process, execute the
Perl binary or compile the Perl program, which will cut down on
server resource use. However, this still means that each time a
user requests the home page, the server must execute a program. If
the page is requested 1,000 times in a given day, then the program
will run 1,000 times. This might not sound like much, but imagine
what happens when your site grows in popularity, getting 1,000,000
hits each day.</p><p>Even this solution doesn't address the fact that not all
users run browsers which handle redirection. If a browser does not
handle the notice, the user will be unable to see today's file.
This problem is increasingly rare, but keep it in mind if you want
the maximum possible audience for your web site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183f580.0x1937c90"></a>Automatically Copying Pages with cron</h2></div></div><p>Let's now examine a strategy in which the program runs only
once per day, regardless of how many people ask to see today's
page. This method reduces the load on the server and allows people
with old browsers to visit our site without any trouble. The
easiest strategy is to use Linux's
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> utility, which allows us to
automatically run programs at any time. Using cron, we can run our
program once per day, copying the appropriate file to today.html.
On Sundays, file-0.html will be copied to today.html, while on
Thursdays, file-4.html will be copied to today.html.</p><p><a href="3060l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> is an example of
such a program. If this program were run once a day, then
today.html would always contain the file for the appropriate day.
Moreover, the server would be able to respond to the document
request without having to create a new CGI process or use
Perl.</p><p>The above program is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> run through
CGI, but rather through cron. In order to run a program through
cron, you must add an entry to your
<span   class="bold"><b>crontab</b></span>, a specially formatted
text file that describes when a program should be run. Each user
has a separate crontab file; that is, each user can arrange for
different cron jobs to run at different dates and times.</p><p>You can edit the crontab file using the crontab program,
which is typically in /usr/bin/crontab. To modify your crontab
file, use <b  >crontab -e</b>, which brings up the editor
defined in the <b  >EDITOR</b> environment variable. The
format of crontab is too involved for me to explain here; typing
<b  >man 5 crontab</b> on the Linux command line will
bring up the manual page describing the format. (Typing only
<b  >man crontab</b> will bring up a description of the
crontab program, rather than the crontab file format, a distinction
which can be confusing to new users.)</p><p>Assuming we want to run the above program (which I have
called cron-today.pl) at one minute after midnight, we could add
the following entry to our crontab:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/cron-today.pl
</pre><p>In other words, we want to run /usr/local/bin/cron-today.pl
at one minute after midnight (<b  >1 0</b>), every day of
the month (<b  >*</b>), every month
(<b  >*</b>), and every day of the week
(<b  >*</b>).
</p><p>The output from each cron is e-mailed to the user who owns
that job. After installing the above line in my crontab, I receive
e-mail from the cron job each day at approximately 12:01 a.m. And
each day, anyone visiting our site was shown the correct file for
today.html.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183f580.0x1938420"></a>Using Symbolic Links</h2></div></div><p>The above cron-based technique works, but has some annoying
side effects. For example, what happens if you decide to change the
Tuesday menu on Tuesday morning? The change will not be reflected
until the following Tuesday, because today.html contains the
contents of file-2.html from 12:01 a.m., when the snapshot was
taken.</p><p>In order to solve this problem, as well as reduce the disk
space used by two copies of the program, we can use symbolic links.
These look like files, but are really pointers to files, similar to
Macintosh &ldquo;aliases&rdquo; or Windows &ldquo;shortcuts&rdquo;. If we create a
symbolic link from today.html to file-0.html, the two file names
will be equivalent for most purposes. (Other &ldquo;hard&rdquo; links are
also available under Linux, but are more limited.)</p><p>If we want to create a symbolic link named today.html that
points to file-0.html, we say</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s file-0.html today.html
</pre><p>If you want to change the link so that it points to
file-1.html, remove the old link and create a new one, like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rm -fv today.html
ln -s file-1.html today.html
</pre>


Alternatively, we can use the <b  >-f</b> (&ldquo;force&rdquo;)
option to <b  >ln</b>, forcing the link assignment even
if it was previously linked elsewhere:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ln -sf file-0.html today.html
</pre>


If we were to do this each day, removing the old link and creating
a new one, we would be doing effectively the same thing as in
cron-today.pl, but with the added advantage of equating the two
files. In addition, we would be saving space on the file system by
pointing to the original file rather than copying it.
</p><p><a href="3060l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a> contains a short
Perl program meant to be run via cron, which creates such a link.
Anything sent to standard output (STDOUT) via &ldquo;print&rdquo; statements
is sent to the owner of the cron job. This program assumes the
owner of the cron job (under whose user ID the program is run) has
permission to remove the existing file, as well as create a new
symbolic link in the directory. It is possible to create a symbolic
link to any file, including a nonexistent file; only when you try
to access the file are the permissions checked.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183f580.0x1938898"></a>Publishing Daily Items</h2></div></div><p>The techniques we have examined so far are most useful when
the same item appears each week or perhaps each month. In many
cases, though, publishing on the Web involves creating a new file
each day and making that available. For starters, we will look into
how to create a new file each day (of the form file-1.html, as
before), so that the newest file will be available by looking at
today.html.</p><p>Once again, we could accomplish this with either a CGI
program or a cron job, examples of which you can see in
<a href="3060l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a> and
<a href="3060l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a>, respectively. Both
programs use the same basic algorithm to find the highest-numbered
file of the form file-n.html, where n is the sequential number for
the file.</p><p>The key to both programs is in these lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if (opendir(DIR, $directory))
{
@files = sort by_number
   grep {/^file-[0-9]+\.html$/} readdir(DIR);
closedir DIR;
}
</pre><p>First, we open <b  >$directory</b>, the directory
in which the files exist. (If the program cannot open the
directory, it logs an error.) We then read the contents of the
directory DIR, using Perl's <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>
function to filter out any files not fitting the file-n.html
pattern. Finally, we sort those files with our own
<span   class="bold"><b>by_number</b></span> routine, which compares
the sequential numbers rather than the full file name.
</p><p>Once we have the list of files, we pick off the last element
of @files, which has the highest sequential number. We can then
redirect the user's browser to that file using CGI.pm's
<span   class="bold"><b>redirect</b></span> method.</p><p>If we want to publish items each day, we should try a better
system than this one, which depends on sequential numbers. First of
all, it is easier to handle file names which mention the subject
(e.g., menu.html) or the date (e.g., file-1998-06-01), rather than
something named with sequential numbers, as in
file-3023.html.</p><p>Secondly, arranging articles by date provides users with a
natural way of navigating through archives in the future without
having to depend on the site's navigation scheme. In addition,
creating file names according to date rather than sequential
numbers decreases the chances of error.</p><p>If you choose to use the date in the file name, as in
file-1998-06-01, try to keep the date elements in year-month-day
order, so that sorting file names alphanumerically will also sort
them chronologically. Then, we can write a small program to select
the file for today based on the date and run it each day with cron.
An example is shown in <a href="3060l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6.</a>
The program logic is fairly straightforward, taking the date
information from our call to localtime and piecing those elements
together to create the file name.</p><p>However, problems may arise if the file for today does not
exist. As I mentioned earlier, symbolic links do not have to point
to files; they may point to any valid file name, even if no file by
that name exists. However, if the symbolic link points to a
non-existent file, users will be greeted with a dreaded &ldquo;404--File
not found&rdquo; error upon loading today.html from our site. A more
sophisticated version of this program would check to see if a file
corresponding to today's date existed on the site. Such a program
would then search backward (or forward, if you prefer)
chronologically to find the best match for the today.html symbolic
link. It could even send e-mail to the webmaster indicating that
such a problem existed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x183f580.0x192f7b0"></a>Using Databases</h2></div></div><p>One additional method for publishing material on the Internet
regularly is using databases. Rather than relying on file names
keyed with particular dates, we can create a table that establishes
a correspondence between file names and dates. We can then write a
CGI program to retrieve the current file or a program meant to be
run via cron to create a symbolic link to the current file.</p><p>Another option is to store the files inside of the database.
However, if we were to do that, we would also have to make it
possible for the site's editors and designers to store, retrieve
and edit the information inside the database. For our purposes, we
will assume the files exist on the server's file system, and we are
trying to point to them rather than store their contents in a
different way. These examples were tested under Red Hat 5.1, Perl
5.004_04, the database interface (DBI) libraries for Perl, and
MySQL, a mostly free relational database system available from
http://www.mysql.com/.</p><p>Before we can do anything else, we have to create a table to
hold the information. The table will be relatively simple,
containing only file names and dates. We will assume that each
article can be published on only one date, but that each date can
contain multiple articles, which makes our table creation command
look like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Articles
 (filename  VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
 date    DATE NOT NULL);
</pre><p>In the above, we define <b  >filename</b> as a
100-character text field, which must be filled in (<b  >NOT
NULL</b>) and cannot be the same as any other file name
(<b  >PRIMARY KEY</b>). If we try to insert the same file
name on two different dates, the database will stop us. By
contrast, because we want to allow more than one file on a given
date, the <b  >date</b> field (which has a type of
<b  >DATE</b>) is defined as <b  >NOT NULL</b>,
meaning that we must indicate a date with each file name.
</p><p>In order to add a file to our database, we can use the
following SQL command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO Articles (filename, date)
VALUES ("foobar.html", "1998-06-05");
</pre><p>If you are using MySQL, you must put quotation marks around
the date, or the default date of <b  >0000-00-00</b> will
be inserted.
</p><p>In addition to the confirmation message (<b  >1 row
affected</b>) we receive upon submitting the above query, we
can check the contents of the table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM Articles;
+-------------+------------+
| filename    | date       |
+-------------+------------+
| foobar.html | 1998-06-05 |
+-------------+------------+
1 row in set (0.08 sec)
</pre><p>Entering information into a database using raw SQL is
inefficient, prone to errors and unhelpful for users who are
unfamiliar or encomfortable with SQL.
<a href="3060l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a> contains an HTML form
that can be used to enter new articles into the database, using the
program in <a href="3060l8.html" target="_self">Listing 8.</a></p><p>Finally, we will need a version of today.pl that retrieves
the file for today. A CGI version of the program is in
<a href="3060l9.html" target="_self">Listing 9</a>; rewriting it such that
it uses cron should be fairly straightforward. A more sophisticated
version of the program would even check to see if the named file
exists, searching backward.</p><p>Publishing regular articles on the Web is far less
complicated than publishing a daily or weekly newspaper, but still
involves a bit of planning and programming. In addition, no matter
what method you choose, you will still have to make some trade-offs
between performance and flexibility. Nevertheless, creating a page
that changes each day and provides access to the site's archives is
not especially difficult and can provide enough variety to draw
people.</p><p>  All listings referred to in this article are available
