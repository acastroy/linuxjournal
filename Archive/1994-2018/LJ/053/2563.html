    Here's a useful command for translating or deleting
    characters in a file.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e61580.0x1f593a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The program called
<span   class="bold"><b>tr</b></span> is not a big program; it is
quite small and not extremely powerful. However, if you write
scripts, you will treasure it as one of your favorites. It is a
typical script program, reading from stdin and writing to stdout;
there are no file names to provide as arguments. The main function
is translating characters. A second important function is deleting
characters. Furthermore, tr is capable of squeezing repeated
characters into one, but that particular function is rarely used.
</p><p>Let us begin with translating characters. The tr command
takes the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tr
</pre><p>While tr reads its input, it replaces characters appearing in
string1 by the corresponding characters in string2. So, the command
<b  >tr abc def</b> will replace a line like &ldquo;the quick
brown fox quickly jumped over the lazy dog&rdquo; into &ldquo;the quifk erown
fox quifkly jumped over the ldzy dog&rdquo;. Well, that doesn't make
sense, but it does demonstrate how tr works.
</p><p>Have you ever wanted to capitalize or de-capitalize a file?
To capitalize it, you can use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tr abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz \
        ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
</pre><p>Luckily, we can also use ranges of characters to specify the
characters more efficiently:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tr a-z A-Z
</pre>


Ever had those horrible upper case DOS file names? Here's a Bourne
script to take care of them:
<pre     class="programlisting">
for f in *; do
      mv $f `echo $f | tr A-Z a-z`
   done
</pre>


Many UNIX editors allow some text to be processed by the shell. For
example, to replace all upper case characters of the next paragraph
with lower case while in <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
!}tr A-Z a-z
</pre>


As another example, the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
!jtr a-z A-Z
</pre>


capitalizes the current and next line (the character after the
<b  >!</b> is a movement character).
</p><p>If you read the International Obfuscated C Code Contest
(ftp://ftp.uu.net./pub/ioccc/), you frequently see that part of the
hints are coded by a method called
<span   class="bold"><b>rot13</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>rot13</b></span> is a Caesar cypher, i.e., a
cypher in which all letters are shifted some number of places. For
example, a becomes b, b becomes c, ..., y becomes z, and z becomes
a. In rot13 each letter is shifted 13 places. It is a weak cypher,
and to decipher it, you can use rot13 again. You can also use tr to
read the text in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tr a-zA-Z n-za-mN-ZA-M
</pre><p>Another interesting way to use tr is to change files from
Macintosh format to UNIX format. For returns, the Macintosh uses
<b  >\r</b> while UNIX uses <b  >\n</b>. GNU tr
allows you to use the C special characters, so type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tr \r \n
</pre>


If you don't have GNU's version of tr, you can always use the
corresponding octal numbers as shown here:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tr \015 \012
</pre>


You might wonder what would happen if the second string is shorter
than the first string. POSIX says this is not allowed. System V
says that only that portion of the first string is used that has a
matching character in the second string. BSD and GNU pad the second
string with its final character in order to match the length of the
first string.
</p><p>The reason this last method is handy becomes clearer when we
take complements into account. Assume you wish to make a list of
all words and keywords in your listing. When you use
<b  >-c</b>, tr complements the first string. In C, all
identifiers and keywords consist of <b  >a-zA-Z0-9_</b>,
so those are the characters we want to keep. Thus, we can do the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tr -c a-zA-Z0-9_ \n
</pre><p>If we pipe the tr output through <b  >sort -u</b>,
we get our desired list. If we follow POSIX, the second string
would have to describe 193 newline characters (described as
<b  >\n*193</b> or <b  >\n*</b>). If we use
system V, only the zero byte is translated to a newline, since the
complement of <b  >a-zA-Z0-9_</b> starts with the zero
byte.
</p><p>The second important use of tr is to remove characters. For
this option, you use the flag <b  >-d</b> with one string
as an argument. To fix up those nasty MS-DOS text files with a
<b  >^M</b> at the end of the line and a trailing
<b  >^Z</b>, specify tr in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tr -d \015\032
</pre><p>Many people have written a program in C to do this same
operation. Well, a C program isn't necessary&mdash;you only need to know
the right program, tr, with the right flags. The
<b  >-d</b> flag isn't used often, but is nice to have
when needed. You can combine it with the <b  >-c</b> flag
to delete everything except characters from the string you supplied
as an argument.
</p><p>Repeated characters can be squeezed into a single one using
the <b  >-s</b> option with one string as an argument. It
can also be used to squeeze white space. To remove empty lines,
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tr -s \n
</pre><p>The <b  >-s</b> option can be used with two strings
as arguments. In that case, tr first translates the text as if
<b  >-s</b> were not given and then tries to squeeze the
characters in the second string. For instance, we can squeeze all
standard white space to a single space by specifying:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tr -s   \n [ *]
</pre>


The <b  >-d</b> flag can also be used with two strings:
the characters in the first string will be removed and the
characters in the second string will be squeezed.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>tr</b></span> may not be a great
program; however, it gets the job done. It is particularly useful
in scripts using pipes and command substitutions (i.e., inside the
back quotes). If you use tr often, you'll learn to appreciate its
capabilities. Small is beautiful.</p></div></div>
