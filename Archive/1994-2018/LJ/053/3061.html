    SSC's system administrator travels to New Orleans and
    actually returns to tell us about it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232d580.0x24253f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Each year, the USENIX organization
(http://www.usenix.org/) puts on a technical conference dealing
with UNIX and other UNIX-like systems. This year they had an
emphasis on free or Open Source operating systems, primarily Linux
and *BSD. The conference was held in New Orleans, Louisiana from
June 15th to the 20th.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232d580.0x2425500"></a>Tutorials</h2></div></div><p>Many day-long tutorials were offered on Monday and Tuesday
including &ldquo;Inside the Linux Kernel&rdquo; by Stephen Tweedie, one of
the EXT2 developers, and several talks on Networking and Security.
I attended &ldquo;Hot Topics in System Administration&rdquo;, given by Treni
Hein and Evi Nemeth. They covered many topics including Samba,
Packet Filtering and IPv6.</p><p><a href="3061f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b><i>Linux Journal</i>
Booth</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232d580.0x2425768"></a>Vendor Expo</h2></div></div><p>I found it refreshing to see a vendor exposition (albeit a
small one) comprised completely of UNIX-friendly companies.
O'Reilly was there, displaying all of their titles for sale at 20%
off. Needless to say, this made it one of the most popular booths.
Most of the faces were familiar: Red Hat, Linux International,
InfoMagic, the three heads of BSD and others. Among the unexpected
participants was the FBI, just a short distance from the Free
Software Foundation. The whole atmosphere of the exposition was
quite relaxed, without the hectic feel of COMDEX and other large
industry trade shows.</p><p><a href="3061f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>The LI booth
staff are happy to see us.</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232d580.0x2425978"></a>BOFs and Speeches</h2></div></div><p>Each evening offered several talks by different people on a
wide range of subjects. I caught &ldquo;The State of Linux&rdquo; talk by
Linus Torvalds on Thursday afternoon. He set Aug/Sep 98 as a
hopeful release date for the 2.2 kernel. Another event that took
place every evening was the &ldquo;Birds of a Feather&rdquo; (BOF) meetings,
which were designed as a place for people with common interests to
come together and discuss their ideas and goals. It was also a
great place to rub shoulders with some of the &ldquo;big names&rdquo; in the
UNIX community, such as Keith Bolstic, Eric Allman and Jon
&ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232d580.0x2425a80"></a>Terminal Room</h2></div></div><p>What UNIX conference would be complete without a terminal
room? Luckily, Earthlink and openBSD donated machines and bandwidth
and created a room with thirty or so machines running openBSD,
connected to a T1.</p><p><a href="3061f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>The terminal
room at full-tilt boogie.</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232d580.0x2425c90"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>If I were to do it all over again (and I most definitely want
to), I would spend more time planning what I want to learn. I was a
bit overwhelmed by the sheer number of talks/events, and therefore
found it difficult to focus on exactly what I wanted to get from
the experience&mdash;I was constantly spreading myself too thin. For any
UNIX, Linux, BSD etc. lover, USENIX is a must at least once in a
lifetime. It is a very friendly and co-operative environment and
has definitely earned its reputation as one of the hubs of the
computing community.</p><p><a href="3061f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo;
