and I believe most of them to be true. Unfortunately, the extent of
hardware support that some of these articles claim is not a
reality&mdash;or at least does not seem to be when it comes to Compaq
equipment.</p><p>I have just spent the best part of a day searching the
Internet by various means, including various search engines, trying
to find drivers to support the embedded NCR 53C710-based SCSI
controller in a Compaq ProLiant 2000 and also drivers to support a
Compaq SMART SCSI RAID array controller. Result: nothing, except a
lot of stress.</p><p>Please can someone help me (and the many others who I have
encountered looking for these drivers). Linux claims to support
quite a bit of hardware&mdash;please extend this support to include some
key Compaq server items.</p><p>&mdash;Graeme Nelson graeme@cheerful.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5f580.0x2057450"></a>Open Source vs. Free Software</h2></div></div><p>I'm writing you after seeing one too many odes to the glories
of the Open Source movement. I have a serious problem with the
whole Open Source bandwagon due to the fact that Open Source is
almost solely about making free software palatable to business&mdash;a
segment of society which has played a largely non-existent role in
the development of free software. Business has done nothing to make
the user and programmer community at large more aware of the
benefits of free software. I feel the primary benefits are
individual and social freedom.</p><p>The June article by Eric S. Raymond, &ldquo;Open Source Summit&rdquo;,
is a good example of the fundamental emptiness of the Open Source
movement. The O'Reilly conference report struck me as being more
about how Larry Wall, et al., can strike it rich than about how the
lives of users and programmers can be enhanced through free
software. I have nothing against people being financially
compensated for their labor, but being financially compensated for
one's labor has always been a secondary or even irrelevant
consideration in the free software movement and rightfully
so.</p><p>The most appalling notion implied in the rhetoric of the Open
Source movement is that we, those of us who use/write/support free
software, have to change our ways and adopt a more corporate
mindset if we want free software to be successful in the real
world. This is manifestly ridiculous. If free software hadn't
already proven itself thoroughly in the real world, there wouldn't
even be an Open Source movement. In fact, I think that free
software and the free software movement have proven themselves to
such an amazing degree that the corporate world now wants to find a
way to squeeze a buck out of us. Again, there is nothing wrong with
making a buck, but don't you dare do it at the expense of my
freedom.</p><p>Unfortunately, free software developers are not a major
source of advertising dollars for <i  >LJ</i>, so it is
not likely that <i  >LJ</i> will be publishing
alternate views to the Open Source camp anytime soon. That
apparently being the case, I would suggest that if
<i  >LJ</i> readers are interested in an alternate view
of the free software movement, check out, for starters, Richard
Stallman's article &ldquo;Why Free Software is better than Open Source&rdquo;
at http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-or-free.html.</p><p>&mdash;Shawn Ewald shawn@wilshire.net</p><p>While I disagree with your stated beliefs, I'm
always happy to publish alternate views&mdash;I have done so in the
past, do so now with your letter and will do so again in the
future. While it is true that <i  >LJ</i> does not receive
advertising dollars from free software, we put free software items
in the &ldquo;New Products&rdquo; column and publish reviews and tutorials of
free software.</p><p><i  >Linux Journal</i> strongly supports &ldquo;freely available&rdquo; software
and the Open Source movement. This is one reason we chose the
Debian distribution to use in our office.</p><p>By the way, I see no reason for you to have singled out Larry
Wall as looking for a way to &ldquo;strike it rich&rdquo;. Perl is free and
Larry is most definitely not a money-grubbing type of guy.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5f580.0x20579d0"></a>PPPui</h2></div></div><p>My thanks to the numerous people who've written in response

our lab who provide Sybase connectivity (server running on Irix) in
their Linux programs. They told me that it is fairly easy to get it

Mr. Meyers notes that PPP does not have a good user interface: the
only way you know if your connection succeeded or failed is to
check the process list. Mr. Meyers offers a solution.</p><p>There's actually a simpler way than his program: direct
syslog to Console 9 as described in an earlier issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, and enable logging in
<span   class="bold"><b>chat</b></span> using <b  >--v</b>.
Then, just hit <b  >alt&mdash;f9</b> to view your syslog
console, and you can watch the progress of chat's attempt to
connect. Failed connects show up as Alarm, exit or hangups; a
sluggish connection can be observed as
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> sends
<b  >EchoReq</b>'s out. Disconnects show as hangups. This
live syslog is also invaluable when debugging your chat
script.</p><p>&mdash;Cynthia Higginbothamcyhiggin@pipeline.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5f580.0x20580b0"></a>Caldera Review&mdash;Not!</h2></div></div><p>So there I was, reading the review of Caldera OpenLinux (June
1998), and the reviewer, Sid Wentworth, writes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Caldera, by default, uses the Looking Glass
Desktop. Not being a desktop sort of guy, I am not particularly
excited about it, but, if you want a desktop, it seems
adequate.</p></blockquote></div><p>Great! He's not a desktop sort of guy.
Why is a &ldquo;non-desktop&rdquo; kind of guy getting paid for reviewing
anything other than AWK scripts?
</p><p>It's hard to take seriously reviews that completely leave out
subjective comments about functionality a reviewer doesn't really
have an interest in, or more to the point, his
audience does have an interest in. Don't care
about it, don't review it&mdash;simple! The rest of us, though, might
have been interested in the state of this product's constantly
evolving user environment, but the heck with us. You need better
writers, which shouldn't be too difficult. At least the Windows
techies take apart the toys they review.</p><p>&mdash;Tim Parsonstsparsons@earthlink.net</p><p>There is a lot more to Caldera OpenLinux (or any Linux
distribution) than the desktop. Also, desktop choices are available
with any Linux flavor. In the case of Caldera OpenLinux, I found
their proprietary desktop to be unexciting, but I also found that
to be unimportant over all.</p><p>I could have easily written a 50-page review of this
product&mdash;so many capabilities are there to discuss. For example,
each language translator could have been reviewed. Even if I just
looked at GUI capabilities, a comprehensive review of desktops
would need to include comparisons with XFM and other free file
managers.</p><p>Don't get me wrong. If Looking Glass had been exciting, I
would have talked more about it. It wasn't and I don't think it
matters. What did matter, as I said in the article, was StarOffice
which, by the way, is its own desktop.</p><p>&mdash;Sid info@linuxjournal.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5f580.0x20584d0"></a>Summit Article</h2></div></div><p>Fabulous! I wish I'd been there!</p><p>&mdash;Tim O'Reilly, O'Reilly &amp; Associatestim@ora.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5f580.0x2058630"></a>Small Error</h2></div></div><p>I believe that the &ldquo;Best of Tech Support&rdquo; column in the May
1998 <i  >LJ</i> contains a small error. Regarding the
question of Linux's behaviour when a file system is infected with
an MS-DOS virus, Chad Robinson states that because Linux spreads
file system meta-data more evenly throughout the physical disc,
&ldquo;random potshots&rdquo; are more likely to cause corruption of the
meta-data. This is misleading, in that if the amounts of meta-data
were the same, the probability of a potshot hitting the part of an
MS-DOS file system containing meta-data is equal to that of it
hitting more evenly distributed meta-data on an EXT2 file system.
&ldquo;Concentration&rdquo; does not affect the probability, only the amount
of meta-data.</p><p>&mdash;Sidney Cammeresicammeres@uiuc.edu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5f580.0x20587e8"></a>Concerning LTE Issue 50</h2></div></div><p>Simon Maurice in the June 1998 <i  >LJ</i>
criticizes Red Hat v5.0 for perceived shortcomings. Is he truly
serious in saying that Red Hat's RPMS is a &ldquo;Microsoft-like
effort&rdquo;? I think the package management system is one of the
features that puts Red Hat distributions at or near the top of the
pile. Where are all the bugs he alleges? I've found a few wrinkles,
but nothing I'd call a serious bug.</p><p>As to the alleged problems with the actual distribution, I
have run both the v4.2 and the v5.0 distributions as
&ldquo;official/supported&rdquo; releases. I haven't applied any patches&mdash;yet
my system is so stable it hasn't crashed since March 1998 when
RH5.0 was installed. (Which is more than I can say for my Windows
NT4 system.)</p><p>However, I do agree that Red Hat should
be more polite when it comes to customer (e-mail) support. I asked
several questions about the v4.2 distribution and was curtly told
the questions were outside the support structure and to try the
mailing lists. I wasn't happy with that answer, but it taught me to
go to the documented sources first.</p><p>For $50 or so, Red Hat's distribution is by many orders of
magnitude easier to use and install than the first distribution of
Linux I bought back in 1993 (Trans Ameritech, v0.90 kernel).
Compared to commercial operating systems (e.g., SCO, Windows NT),
there is no comparison, whether for value for money, stability or
user support. Where else but in the Linux community can you get bug
fixes (if they are needed) so quickly?</p><p>&mdash;Alan Nutleyanutley@halenet.com.au</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f5f580.0x2058aa8"></a>BTS Comment</h2></div></div><p>I just received the June 1998 <i  >LJ</i>
(love&gt; that airmail delivery folks). In &ldquo;Best
of Technical Support&rdquo;, Chad Robinson and Pierre Ficheux both gave
useful answers to &ldquo;how do I back up NT and Linux&rdquo;. However, you
should know that the AMANDA package (Advanced Maryland Automated
Network Disk Archiver, http://www.amanda.org/) works well with NT
as well as with just about any flavour of UNIX. The current release
version is 2.4.0 (with 2.4.1 in snapshot development form), and
people all over the world are using it to back up all sorts of
machines.</p><p>&mdash;James C. McPhersonjcm@kalessin.humbug.org.au</p></div></div>
