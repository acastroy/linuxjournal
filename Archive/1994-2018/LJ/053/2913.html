provides a practical UNIX system administration view of the AFS
file system. From this book, the reader may gain an appreciation of
the technical issues, skills and knowledge required to install,
configure and manage an AFS environment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x255b580.0x2653ad8"></a>How This Book Can Help</h2></div></div><p>Most vendor documentation focuses on how to install and
configure the product and spends little time explaining the
&ldquo;why,&rdquo; &ldquo;when,&rdquo; &ldquo;where&rdquo; or &ldquo;what&rdquo; of the product. A
third-party book is never meant to replace the vendor's
documentation. Still, a third-party book can often fill in many of
the gaps in the vendor's documentation. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Managing
AFS</em></span> spends considerable time describing &ldquo;why one would
want to use AFS&rdquo;; &ldquo;what benefits can be derived from using AFS&rdquo;;
&ldquo;where might one use AFS&rdquo;; &ldquo;what components comprise an AFS file
system and the relationship of those components&rdquo; and &ldquo;what must
be done to install, configure and manage an AFS Cell&rdquo;. Advanced
AFS administration and how to debug an AFS installation are also
addressed by Mr. Campbell.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x255b580.0x2653c38"></a>The Book's Layout</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Managing AFS</em></span> is divided into 12 chapters
and an appendix of AFS commands. The first two chapters provide an
architectural and technical overview of AFS. Chapter 11 provides
several AFS implementation case studies. A strategy and some tips
for making a business case to support the use of AFS are provided
in Chapter 12. The 50 or so AFS commands are briefly described in
the Appendix. The sections in between the first two and last two
chapters discuss setting up and managing an AFS Cell.</p><p>Chapters 3, 4 and 5 provide an introduction to AFS. These
chapters cover setting up an AFS server, performing AFS operations
on volumes and files, and setting up and administering an AFS
client platform.</p><p>The focus of Chapters 6 and 7 shifts from system
administration to AFS user account administration and security.
Chapter 6, &ldquo;Managing Users&rdquo;, describes how to establish AFS user
accounts using Transarc's implementation of Kerberos.
Administration of Transarc's Kerberos database is also discussed.
AFS user login, authentication, groups and directory/file access
controls are addressed in Chapter 7, &ldquo;Using AFS&rdquo;. Transarc
includes their implementation of some conventional UNIX user
commands, programming commands and programs with AFS. Examples of
UNIX commands and programs that have been modified by Transarc
include chmod, df, close, lockf, ftpd, login and inetd. Differences
between the two implementations are described.</p><p>Chapter 8, &ldquo;Archiving Data&rdquo;, provides a momentary break
from the other AFS administration concepts and tasks. As stated
earlier, AFS supports the global distribution of files. With global
distribution comes the challenge of file restoration. In addition
to the user's data, data describing the AFS implementation and
configuration must also be backed up. Challenges, tools and
strategies used to back up and restore an AFS file system are
presented here.</p><p>With the basics behind you, Chapter 9, &ldquo;More AFS
Administration&rdquo;, explores the finer details of AFS administration.
Server management, updating AFS binaries, job notification,
changing the cell name, adding and removing database servers,
adding and removing file servers, multi-homed servers and NFS-AFS
gateways are just a few of the topics discussed.</p><p>Even a well-designed and implemented product will have
problems. Chapter 10, &ldquo;Debugging Problems&rdquo;, offers a set of
strategies for debugging an AFS installation. An explanation about
when and how to use the available debugging tools is provided. This
chapter also offers a set of typical AFS administration tasks that
should be regularly performed and tested.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x255b580.0x2653f50"></a>Why Consider AFS?</h2></div></div><p>The original Andrew File System was created by a group of
researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). They were striving
to overcome the challenges associated with providing centralized
file services in a distributed environment. Their AFS solution
worked so well that many of the original researchers left CMU and
formed the Transarc Corporation. AFS is now a registered trademark
used by the Transarc Corporation to identify the commercial
packaging of the Andrew File System. The AFS model was used as the
basis for the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed File
System (DFS) specification. Transarc has ensured there is a
migration path from AFS to DFS.</p><p>A small shop with few workstations or shared files may have
little need for AFS, whereas a large shop with many workstations,
servers and the need to globally share files may have a greater
need for it. In addition to being able to manage AFS servers and
clients from a single workstation, AFS reportedly provides several
other performance and financial benefits.</p><p>The book refers to &ldquo;published&rdquo; data on how AFS can support
five to ten times more end users per server than other file
systems. This increased user-to-server ratio translates into a need
for fewer servers and fewer file storage administrators. An AFS
file system can be made highly available using two or more AFS
servers. This means that the loss of a server will not translate
into a user being denied access to the file system.</p><p>One set of tests cited for an organization using NFS file
sharing found that switching to AFS resulted in several performance
improvements. For the same NFS type of workload, AFS resulted in a
60% decrease in network traffic. The server's load was decreased by
80%, and task execution time was reduced by 30%.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x255b580.0x2654160"></a>Linux AFS Port Availability</h2></div></div><p>Transarc has ported AFS to most commercial UNIX platforms, as
well as NT. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has made
several non-Transarc supported ports of AFS to various other
architectures. The MIT ports used source code owned by Transarc.
(The source code is reported to be available for a reasonable
price.) Therefore, access to the MIT ports requires one to be an
AFS licensee or affiliated with an organization who is an AFS
licensee. Linux AFS is one of the several ports made by MIT.</p><p><a href="2913s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
