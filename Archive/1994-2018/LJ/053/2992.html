    I can't help but feel that the community would be better
    served if these enthusiasts picked their favorite distribution and
    contributed
    toward making it the ultimate distribution.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf65580.0x105d1e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>I have been seeing what I consider to be
a disturbing trend in the Linux community. A computer wizard
discovers Linux, decides it's cool, but doesn't think any of the
current distributions are adequate. So, he gets together with a few
of his friends and begins working on &ldquo;yet another&rdquo; Linux
distribution. Don't get me wrong, these guys are great! They are
investing a lot of time and effort in attempting to put together
the &ldquo;boss&rdquo; distribution.
</p><p>Somehow though, I can't help but feel that the community
would be better served if these enthusiasts picked their favorite
distribution and contributed toward making it the ultimate
distribution. The more distributions are available, the more
difficult it becomes for newcomers to make a choice and experts to
keep up with them all. Even worse, as distributions become more and
more divergent, Linux applications will not work on all of them.
Thus, they are competitors with each other rather than united in
competition with Microsoft and Apple.</p><p>In calling for a Linux Standard Base System Project, Bruce
Perens said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Binary compatibility between Linux distributions
has become a casualty of the competition between them. There are
vast differences in versions of libraries, etc., that make it
difficult for a commercial application to target more than one
Linux distribution. This fragmentation is one of the main reasons
that UNIX was crippled in the computer market.</p></blockquote></div><p>Bruce is right: there needs to be a base standard. Then,
using that standard, programmers should contribute to their
favorite distribution rather than creating a new one. Let's be sure
that Linux doesn't follow the same path as UNIX.
</p><p>In a similar vein, if the newcomer is not a programmer, he
often chooses to create another resources web page rather than a
distribution. Every week I hear of a new Linux page. Again, these
pages have excellent material, but a lot of them duplicate each
other. When another newbie looks for Linux information, he finds
not just a few Linux pages, but many. Sorting through them all is
time consuming and confusing. I think a better method for the new
enthusiast would be to pick a page that's been around a while and
appeals to him personally, then offer to contribute to it. Most
webmasters for these pages are glad to receive current
information.</p><p>SSC has always been willing to provide space for new sections
and add information provided by others in order to ensure that our
Linux Resources page is as comprehensive and attractive as
possible. This attitude is not unique to us&mdash;slashdot.org and Linux
Weekly News are other sites willing to accept contributions from
the community.</p><p>I'm not saying we should have only one Linux distribution; we
just don't need one for every new person who discovers Linux. The
message here is, don't reinvent the wheel&mdash;pick your favorite
distribution or resources page and help make it better.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf65580.0x105d5b0"></a>Next Month</h2></div></div><p>In our October issue, we have a great article about how Cisco
Systems is using Linux print servers worldwide. The author, Damian
Ivereigh, discusses technical issues involved with the print system
and provides the method and code for solving common problems. If
you work for a large corporation (or even a small one) with chaotic
print services, this article is a must read.</p><p>As usual, I had more articles for our graphics focus issue
than would fit in this magazine. So, in our next issue we will
continue this focus with an article about a set of audio tools for
Linux called Sculptor. These tools can be used for manipulating
audio spectra and providing continuous audio output.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf65580.0x105d710"></a>Outsourcing Subscriptions</h2></div></div><p>Once again, <i  >Linux Journal</i> has outsourced
its subscription services; this time to a fulfillment house in
Missouri City, Texas. We truly believe that in the long term, this
solution will provide the best service to our subscribers.
Unfortunately, this house was not prepared for the massive amount
of e-mail <i  >LJ</i> receives, and so is off to a
shaky start. I apologize to those of you who got caught in this
transition and did not receive timely answers to your mail. I
expect that by the time you read this, all problems will have been
solved, and services will be running smoothly.</p><p>Do your part to help cut down on the amount of e-mail
subscription services receives. Before writing complaint e-mail,
check our web site for your subscription status and finger
info@linuxjournal.com for the actual mailing date of the current
issue.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf65580.0x105d920"></a>Upcoming Events</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>6th USENIX Tcl/Tk Conference, September 14-18,
