    We continue with our look at converting an office from a
    commercial operating system to Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265c580.0x2754870"></a></h2></div></div><p>Welcome to the second article of our
three-part series on migrating to Linux from a commercial operating
system. Our first installment (in August) discussed many reasons
why a non-technical, small office or home office (SOHO) end user
might abandon their commercial OS and adopt Linux. This month,
we'll explore several pointers SOHO Linux users may find helpful in
making their migration safe, comfortable and productive. We'll also
investigate some of the software tools, both commercial and Open
Source, that SOHO users may find useful. Finally, we'll discuss
interfacing and sharing files with our friends, clients and
colleagues who have yet to see the light and join the Linux camp.
</p><p>We assume the reader has one of the many fine Linux
distributions installed and working. If you have not yet taken the
plunge and installed a Linux system, please read on anyway.
Hopefully, every current or potential SOHO Linux user will gain a
more complete understanding of what it takes to use Linux in a SOHO
environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265c580.0x27549d0"></a>Do You Have to Become an Expert?</h2></div></div><p>One obstacle preventing SOHO users from considering Linux is
the &ldquo;hacker mystique&rdquo; surrounding the OS. To many new users,
Linux has the image of an expert's paradise, a playground for gurus
only. We did much to explode that myth in our first article. Still,
for many potential Linux users, the unanswered question remains:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>how hard and time-consuming is it to maintain a Linux
system in a SOHO environment?</em></span></p><p>Once your system is installed and configured, you may
discover that maintaining it is not that hard. You will not have to
become an expert in system administration, nor will you necessarily
have to spend much time logged in as root performing administrative
tasks. In fact, you may end up spending a bigger percentage of your
time actually working rather than dealing with the system. Is
maintaining a SOHO Linux system any easier than other operating
systems? Not necessarily, but many find that once they have
developed a core of basic competencies, running their SOHO Linux
systems is no harder than maintaining any other OS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265c580.0x2754b88"></a>The Tasks at Hand</h2></div></div><p>In order to gain confidence in ourselves and our Linux
systems, SOHO Linux users need to be proficient in several key
facets of system administration. The minutiae of all the various
commands and tasks are beyond the scope of this article. Therefore,
we will focus on those we feel are most important to SOHO users:
maintaining software, performing regular backups and, in case of
emergencies, boot/root disk use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265c580.0x2754c90"></a>What is System Administration?</h2></div></div><p>For the SOHO Linux user, basic system administration means
all of the work done to keep the machine up and running smoothly,
such as installing/upgrading software and removing old files&mdash;for
more accomplished users, it may mean compiling a custom kernel.
Notice that our needs and responsibilities are considerably less
than those of an administrator looking after a network of servers
and workstations. Here are several key pieces of advice which you
may find helpful:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Be self-sufficient&mdash;invest in at least one decent
Linux manual (see Resources). Locate and bookmark some of the many
Linux documentation sites on the Internet. Read all available
documentation before posting questions on the newsgroups. These
suggestions may seem obvious and elementary, yet anyone who reads
the newsgroups knows how many well-documented, easily-solved
problems are repeated over and over again, wasting a lot of
valuable time and energy for both the posters and those trying to
help them. On the other hand, don't try to learn everything&mdash;there
is just too much to know. Keep your Linux information resources
handy and use them as a reference library. Whenever you are stumped
or run into a problem, have your resources available and know how
to use them. Especially at first, it is better to concentrate on
&ldquo;how do I look it up quickly&rdquo; rather than trying to memorize
individual commands.</p></li><li><p>Keep an eye on the updates and recent developments
going on in the Linux software community, in particular as they
pertain to the distribution you are using (see Resources). You will
occasionally need to install or upgrade software as bugs and
security problems are detected. You don't need to spend hours every
day reading about Linux. One reasonable schedule is to spend at
least an hour every 10 business days cruising the relevant web
sites for recommended software updates and new tools that may help
you get your work done. The kind and patient souls who read the
newsgroups will thank you for reading about these updates before
posting problems.</p></li><li><p>Once you have your system installed and set up to
your liking, do not log in as root unless absolutely necessary.
Again, this is an elementary rule that Linux gurus usually follow,
but SOHO users need to be wary and avoid this pitfall. It's truly
hard to cause a full system crash in Linux&mdash;unless you are
foolishly mucking about while logged in as root.</p></li><li><p>Take the time to learn a little about the
<span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span> shell. Most Linux manuals
have at least some introduction to bash and various shell commands,
but a more comprehensive look may be in order. Knowing bash well
can save you time. When tinkering with bash, remember point number
one above: don't bother memorizing every command, but do keep your
manual handy.</p></li><li><p>After you have learned a bit about the system, made
reliable backups and are feeling comfortable with Linux, you may
want to try compiling a custom kernel. This exercise will teach you
a lot about the way Linux works and may make your machine run a
little faster than the generic kernels shipped with most
distributions. The guide published in <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s November 1997 &ldquo;Kernel Korner&rdquo; is one of the
best concise guides to kernel compilation available. Read it, and
if it seems to make sense, go for it. It's a fun and enlightening
way to learn more about your system.</p></li><li><p>Trust Linux and the people behind it. It's a
powerful, reliable tool for the small or home office. The thousands
of developers worldwide who work on it have seen to that. After
all, that's why we are migrating, right?</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265c580.0x27552c0"></a>Why Bother with Backups?</h2></div></div><p>Here's a personal story from one of the authors that
illustrates exactly why we all <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> make
regular backups. I'll never forget it. It was late at night, and I
was on a tight deadline, cranking out a major project for a client.
Then, I heard it. A rattling noise, like a backgammon player
shaking a cup of dice. Yes, my hard disk had just croaked&mdash;I was
hearing the heads skipping across the platters in my hard drive.
The machine would not reboot, nor could I access any data on the
drive. After a few seconds of panic and terror, I tore open my desk
drawer and cradled what at that moment was my most prized
possession: a recent tape backup of that entire hard drive. The
next morning was a flurry of intense activity. I notified clients
of a brief delay. I contacted my computer manufacturer (the disk
was under warranty) and demanded a new hard disk&mdash;of course, it
would take 10-14 days. I ended up running out and buying a new
disk, installing it, reinstalling all my software and restoring
most of my precious work from that tape. Eventually, the
manufacturer replaced the dead disk.</p><p>The moral of the story? Disasters can and do strike ordinary
people doing ordinary things on a computer. Your responsibility is
to be prepared. In my case, the hard drive crash was softened from
a disaster to an inconvenience, all because I had that backup tape.
Fortunately, Linux comes complete with a set of utilities that make
backups safe, easy and reliable. Plus, several commercial and free
software options exist to automate and simplify the backup process.
Ideally, backups should be performed daily. In reality, doing a
full backup about twice a week is a reasonable schedule for most
SOHO users. Plus, if possible, store every other backup off-site.
Even if your spouse or parent takes one tape or disk to work and
brings back the other one, you are reducing the risk of losing your
backup to fire or theft. Never leave your backup media sitting in
the backup device.</p><p>If you don't have access to a backup program, Linux has
several options to tide you over until you get one. Probably the
most used is the <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> command,
which you should have at least an understanding of, even if you end
up using a different backup option. Spend some time looking at the
tar man page. Check your Linux manual; most give a fairly thorough
analysis of this key backup option. At the very least, until you
have a more reliable backup routine, copy key files to a floppy
using the <span   class="bold"><b>cp</b></span> command.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265c580.0x2755580"></a>Boot/Root Disks</h2></div></div><p>Assume it's 9 AM on a weekday. Your client expects delivery
of a key project by noon. You finished it last night at 11:30 PM,
after hours of revision and several pots of coffee. All you have to
do now is boot up your machine, print out a final copy and fax it
off. Except for one little problem: you machine refuses to boot.
Only three hours until your deadline&mdash;what now?</p><p>Linux will rarely choke, provided you are not tweaking with
the system or mucking around while logged in as root. However, some
hardware failures can sneak up on you. In any case, you must be
prepared to act when your machine doesn't want to boot. That means
having and knowing how to use a good set of Boot/Root disks, also
known as rescue disks (see Resources).</p><p>The Boot/Root disk may one day turn out to be your best
friend. While a comprehensive set of instructions are beyond the
scope of this article, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span> to understand
how to use them. Many distributions come with a set of boot disks
that double as emergency disks, or you can download a pre-built
set. In any case, get them and know how to use them before a
disaster strikes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265c580.0x2755790"></a>Getting Stuff Done</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have covered guidelines for basic system
administration, it's time to think about doing some work.
Fortunately, the last several months have seen an explosion in the
amount of productivity software&mdash;both free and
commercial&mdash;available for Linux users.</p><p>As for the Open Source versus commercial software debate, the
choice boils down to the preferences and budget of the user. Most
users will end up with a hodgepodge of both free and commercial
software on their systems. SOHO users, additionally, have their
limited time and accountability to clients or colleagues to
consider when making their choice. Our advice is to thoroughly
check the capabilities of any software you plan to use.</p><p>Let's look at an example. Say it costs you $100 to purchase a
piece of commercial software and you figure it will take four hours
to install, configure and gain familiarity with the product. Now
compare that to an Open Source product. While you pay nothing for
the software, it may take you ten hours to install and become
comfortable using it. Which product do you choose? It's up to you
and your priorities. Just remember: Open Source does not always
mean free of expenses, while commercial software can never be
automatically assumed to be easier to use or of higher quality.
Judge each package by its individual merits and make the right
choice for yourself.</p><p>Regardless of your choice, we believe it is up to us as SOHO
Linux users to provide positive feedback to both commercial
developers and the kind souls who develop Open Source packages.
Linux is the best SOHO/workstation OS on the market right now, but
most commercial developers have yet to embrace it with the support
it deserves. On the other hand, we can't expect free software
developers to fill all the voids left in the Linux software
library. By rewarding those commercial developers who do port their
software to Linux, we can encourage others to do so; and by using
Open Source software, we encourage the type of cooperation that has
made Linux the great OS it is today.</p><p>Does this mean any one development model is the best option
for SOHO users? No, we are merely suggesting that if you do choose
to use commercial software for Linux, please be sure to obey the
developers' licensing restrictions and give positive feedback or
bug reports on the product, if applicable. If you are using Open
Source packages, please consider contributing to such development
efforts, by donating your own time or perhaps even financially, if
you can.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265c580.0x27559f8"></a>Applications ... Applications ... Applications
...</h2></div></div><p>Too many useful Linux applications exist to list them here.
For the SOHO Linux user, a few key applications are available which
do bear mentioning in this context. As for the other possible
software tools, we should remember number two on the list of
recommendations made earlier: know where to find good catalogs of
Linux software (see Resources).</p><p>One of the biggest news items to hit the Linux community
recently is the announcement from the Corel Corporation. Corel has
committed to porting its productivity applications to Linux. For
those of us who use our Linux boxes for earning a living, this is
indeed welcome news. Corel's announcement, along with the
continuing evolution of other Linux software, means that most Linux
users may no longer have any reason to boot another OS.</p><p>Most SOHO Linux users will do the vast majority of their real
work while in the X graphical environment. While there are at least
a dozen useful window managers (see Resources) for Linux, the two
user environments making the biggest headlines right now are the K
Desktop Environment (KDE) and the GNU Network Object Model
Environment (GNOME). A commercial option is the Common Desktop
Environment (CDE). While many developer types and other gurus have
different reasons to prefer one over the other, we SOHO users will
most likely end up basing our choice once again on personal
preference.</p><p>When you mention productivity, especially for SOHO users, the
first thing that comes to mind is a good, full-function office
suite. Right now, the two &ldquo;biggies&rdquo; in the Linux community are
Applixware and StarOffice. Corel's port of its office suite will
add a third option. As for e-mail and web surfing, Netscape's
decision to open the source code for its Communicator 5 is perhaps
the best news for the SOHO user. Until that product reaches
maturity, Netscape's Communicator 4.0x will meet most users'
needs.</p><p>Soon, we can look forward to at least one full-featured
financial management program&mdash;a la Intuit's Quicken line of
software&mdash;known as GNU Cash. As for graphics and graphic
manipulation, we have the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)
which rivals Adobe's PhotoShop. Corel has also ported their
CorelDraw program; as they port the rest of their commercial
applications to Linux, we hope they will take the time to update
the package.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265c580.0x2755c60"></a>Sharing Data</h2></div></div><p>While trying to make up your mind about which software you'd
like to use, pay particular attention to whether or not you will
need to share files with your non-Linux friends or colleagues. This
is especially important for users of the various office suite
tools. For example, will you be able to share and save your files
in a de facto standard format such as Microsoft Word (.doc)? Or
will you be forced to save and share your files in another format
like Rich Text Format (.rtf)? Either way, you need to be sure your
clients and colleagues will be able to use the files you produce
for them.</p><p>Another key skill for integrating with non-Linux users is the
ability to mount, read from and write to MS-DOS, VFAT and HFS
floppies and other removable media. This will enable you to share
floppies with Microsoft and Macintosh users. Check under the
<span   class="bold"><b>mount</b></span> command in your Linux manual
and read the man page for mount and also the MTOOLS and HTOOLS
utilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265c580.0x274c6a8"></a>Until Next Time</h2></div></div><p>We've talked a little about basic system administration,
software for the SOHO user and sharing files with our colleagues.
Let's sum up a few of the key points:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Make yourself as self-sufficient as possible by
owning at least one comprehensive Linux manual, bookmarking and
regularly visiting major Linux software web sites, judicious use of
relevant IRC channels, and refraining from posting to newsgroups
until you have exhausted other avenues of help.</p></li><li><p>Make reliable, frequent and regular backups, using
any supported removable media, and storing the media off-site, if
possible.</p></li><li><p>Acquire and learn to use a good set of Boot/Root or
emergency disks. Your choice as to which distribution to use may be
influenced by whether or not it comes with a pre-built,
comprehensive set of recovery disks.</p></li><li><p>Don't be intimidated&mdash;you don't have to be a major
guru or techie to get your work done. Following these simple
guidelines should have you on your way to running a solid, reliable
and stable SOHO Linux setup.</p></li><li><p>Carefully weigh all options before investing time
and money in software. One of the greatest benefits to using Linux
is the freedom of choice&mdash;find the packages best for you.</p></li><li><p>Be aware of how to share files and data with your
non-Linux colleagues, clients and friends. Successfully interfacing
with non-Linux users will make your life easier and may serve to
win a few more Linux converts.</p></li></ul></div><p>Well, now we know a little bit more about what we face if we
choose to &ldquo;go Linux&rdquo; and leave our old OS behind. Next time,
we'll move away from practical issues and discuss the future of
Linux as it applies to the non-technical, SOHO end user. We'll also
talk about how SOHO Linux users can get help from each other,
without overwhelming the newsgroups and other traditional avenues
of support. See you next time.</p><p><a href="3042s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
