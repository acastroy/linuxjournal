installing it, I encountered an &ldquo;unsatisfied dependencies&rdquo; error
message in the package manager. Where do you go for missing Linux
libraries and how do you install them?  &mdash;Kelvin L. Barnes,
Kelvin.Barnes@worldnet.att.net</p><p>If you're using an RPM-based distribution such as Red Hat,
you install missing libraries the same way as any other software
(i.e., by installing RPMs with the rpm program). You can find the
RPMs containing these libraries by searching
<a href="http://www.rpmfind.net" target="_self">http://www.rpmfind.net/</a>
or
<a href="http://www.rpmsearch.net" target="_self">http://www.rpmsearch.net/</a>.
On my Red Hat 6.1 box, I've installed the rpmfind utility (which
was on the CD) provided by these sites, and it makes finding and
downloading RPMs a snap:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpmfind -v --auto --latest
<span   class="emphasis"><em>your_rpm_name_here</em></span>
</pre><p>You still have to install the RPMs (as root,
typically) after they're downloaded:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -Uhv
</pre>


Another place to search is your distribution's download
sites, which sometimes include software that wasn't shipped on the
CD for various reasons. Red Hat's sites (use mirror sites if
possible) are at
<a href="ftp://ftp.redhat.com" target="_self">ftp://ftp.redhat.com/</a> and
<a href="ftp://updates.redhat.com" target="_self">ftp://updates.redhat.com/</a>.
Occasionally, RPMs designed for one distribution may not operate
correctly on another&mdash;the RPM itself is okay, but the files
contained in it may have been configured differently, or they may
be placed in different locations than normal for your distribution.
If given a choice, choose an RPM that matches your distribution
(e.g., if you're running Red Hat and you see &ldquo;redhat&rdquo; in the URL
of one of the RPMs, that's probably the one you should choose). I
have rarely encountered this problem, though.  &mdash;Scott Maxwell,
maxwell@ScottMaxwell.org Was this &ldquo;application&rdquo; a RPM file? If
so, it should have taken care of all dependencies. Otherwise, the
&ldquo;missing&rdquo; libraries could be an infinite number, so reading the
application's documentation, specifically about requirements,
should point you in the right direction. Usually your
distribution's web site should have all sources for your Linux
libraries and you should be able to download almost (99%)
everything from there, unless it is a very specialized
library.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse Bou&eacute;,

would like to use them all. So far, only /dev/lp0 works. Echoing
into /dev/lp1 and /dev/lp2 returns the following nastygram:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
BASH: /dev/&lt;device name&gt;: Device not configured
</pre><p>The ports work under Win98, so there are no IRQ or I/O
address conflicts. Here's some more information:m</p><pre     class="programlisting">
IRQ     IO range        Win98 name
7       0378-037f       lpt2
5       03bc-03be       lpt1
9       0278-027a       lpt3
</pre><p>&mdash;Luis F. Gonzalez, gonzalezl@saic.com</p><p>Using ports in
Linux requires two steps. First, your kernel must recognize the
devices. You can check this by either scrolling through your boot
messages by typing <b  >dmesg | less</b>, or checking
/proc/ioports and /proc/devices. The second step is to create the
device file in /dev. If this file does not exist, you can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>makedev</b></span> script found in
the same directory to create most Linux device nodes. If it does
exist, your problem is most likely with the first step.  &mdash;Chad
Robinson, crobinson@rfgonline.com If you've installed the kernel
sources, the file /usr/src/linux/Documentation/parport.txt
addresses this in detail. Briefly, if the ports are not
automatically recognized and configured, and if printing and
parallel port support are compiled as modules (not compiled into
the kernel proper), try adding the following lines to the file
/etc/conf.modules:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
alias parport_lowlevel parport_pc
options parport_pc io=0x3bc,0x378,0x278 irq=5,7,9
options lp parport=auto
</pre><p>Then, from the shell, try removing and reinserting the
relevant modules (the order is important):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rmmod lp
rmmod parport_probe
rmmod parport_pc
rmmod parport
insmod parport
insmod parport_pc
insmod parport_probe
insmod lp
</pre><p>You will need to do all of this as root. I'm not an
expert at configuring parallel ports, since it normally works
correctly out of the box for me; I've done it on only one machine,
and on a different distribution from yours, so I may have
overlooked something. You may need to experiment a little before it
works. Perhaps some ambitious reader will turn parport.txt into a
proper HOWTO, if that hasn't been done already.  &mdash;Scott Maxwell,

Linux, the other is for Windows 98 (second edition). I can't boot
to Win98 when both drives are up. They're set up fine (one master,
one slave, BIOS finds them, etc.). I can boot Linux with both
drives connected. If I disconnect the Linux drive, I can run Win98
fine. LILO seems to know that it has a DOS drive and a Linux drive.
If I say &ldquo;dos&rdquo; at the boot prompt, LILO doesn't complain&mdash;things
just hang. I've even tried booting with a Win98 boot floppy; the
system reads from the floppy for a while and then just hangs&mdash;no
message, no nothing. One drive is a WD, the other is IBM. Please
help!  &mdash;Mitch, mitchp20@home.com</p><p>I am assuming that the master disk has Linux on it, therefore
you can boot fine with both disks active. It seems there is just a
misconfiguration of your lilo.conf file. You have to tell LILO
where (which physical disk and which partition) DOS/Windows is
located. Check on the specified devices in /etc/lilo.conf. Look in
the section where you have your &ldquo;dos&rdquo; label for /dev/hdaX and
/dev/hdbY (X and Y being partition numbers) and hda, hdb
representing your physical disks. You may need to find which disk
holds what. Two lines like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
other=/dev/hdb1
     label=dos
</pre><p>may be what is needed for you to be able to boot
DOS (and Linux) with both disks on. Don't forget to write that LILO
info to the boot sector with <b  >/sbin/lilo -v</b> after
you have made changes in /etc/lilo.conf.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse
Bou&eacute;, fbarousse@piensa.com
</p><p>You don't say whether Windows is on the slave or the master.
By default, Windows won't boot from a secondary drive. However, you
can try booting from the second drive by putting the following in
lilo.conf to boot DOS/Windows (it swaps the drive letters):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
other = /dev/hdb1
  label = dosb
  loader = /boot/any_d.b

run from an xterm on my Linux box. The HpUX box has no X libs and
does not accept my function keys. Does anyone know how to make my
function keys work while telneted into this HP system?  &mdash;David,
uxidlm@netscape.net</p><p>Since you state that the HpUX has no X libs, and it
looks to me that you are just using a terminal emulation window
(xterm) in your Linux box, you should be able to define which code
to generate whenever you press a function key so it gets sent to
the HpUx box through your xterm. You can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>xmodmap</b></span> command to
define such sequences on your Linux box. Put those sequences in the
.xmodmaprc file of your login account or in Xmodmap's general
configuration file. Try also keying ESC-1 for F1, ESC-2 for F2,
etc., to test whether your application is getting Fkey sequences.
Lastly, terminal emulation affects the way Fkeys work. You should
have the terminal emulation correctly set up, with the termcap
definitions in both the HpUX side and the Linux xterm session.
--Felipe E. Barousse Bou&eacute;fbarousse@piensa.com I don't have
experience with this specific case, but the normal way to get your
function keys (and other nonstandard keys) recognized is to modify
your TERM setting after logging in on the remote machine. You do
this with something like <b  >export TERM=termtype</b>
(for bash or ksh) or <b  >setenv TERM termtype</b> (for
csh or tcsh). You may need to experiment with values for
&ldquo;termtype&rdquo;--I would try values like &ldquo;xterm&rdquo;, &ldquo;vt100&rdquo;,
&ldquo;vt220&rdquo;, &ldquo;hpterm&rdquo; and &ldquo;linux&rdquo; (in increasing order of
desperation). If none of those works, look through /etc/termcap on
the remote machine for other possible values of TERM. When you find
a value that works, simply copy the TERM assignment into your shell
startup file (.bash_profile, .cshrc, or whatever) on the remote
system, and you'll never have to worry about it again.  &mdash;Scott

trying to connect my scanner, I changed sda1 to hda1 and now I
can't gain access to my C: drive from Linux or from LILO. When it
gets to the LILO prompt and I select Windows, it just locks up. How
do I get the link back?  &mdash;Faron Ducharme,
faron_ducharme@ti.com</p><p>You don't mention how you &ldquo;changed sda1 to hda1&rdquo;. However,
LILO's configuration information is stored in /etc/lilo.conf. After
editing this file, you will need to run LILO from a command prompt
to tell it to reread its settings.  &mdash;Chad Robinson,
crobinson@rfgonline.com Does Linux boot fine? Seems you are using
SCSI disks, so if you renamed sda1 to hda1 in the /dev directory,
changing it back should solve the problem, providing you haven't
changed LILO's configuration at /etc/lilo.conf. Logged in as root,
use <b  >mv /dev/hda1 /dev/sda1</b>. If you cannot boot
Linux, then you would have to use the emergency boot disk (you have
one, don't you?) you made at installation time to be able to boot
the machine and then change the device names back to normal as
indicated above.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse
