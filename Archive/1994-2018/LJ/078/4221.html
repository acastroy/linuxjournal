    Indrema's revolutionary high-end game console will capitalize on
    embedded Linux and open-source software development.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec8608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Indrema's web site
(http://www.indrema.com/) proclaims, &ldquo;The future of Linux is on
your TV.&rdquo; Reading on, I was soon informed that the Indrema
entertainment system would be a &ldquo;revolutionary product built on a
revolutionary operating system, Linux&rdquo;. An easy-to-use
entertainment appliance: &ldquo;Just turn it on, and sit back on your
couch.&rdquo;
</p><p>Not a PC, mind you. &ldquo;This is no desktop Linux system,&rdquo;
continued the website pitch, &ldquo;this is Linux for TV, for game
addicts, for total entertainment. Out of the box, you can hook it
up and begin playing unbelievably realistic 3-D games, browsing the
Net at high speed, or just enjoying personal TV or MP3
favorites.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;This is not your normal consumer electronics company,&rdquo; I
thought. Indrema clearly seemed to have wrapped itself around
Linux&mdash;in a big way. Questions like &ldquo;Who are these guys?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What
are they up to?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What's their angle with respect to open
source?&rdquo; were coursing through my brain cells.</p><p>Desiring answers to these and many other questions, I quickly
phoned up Indrema's CEO, John Gildred to request an opportunity to
chat. A week later, Gildred and I spent an intense hour exploring
his new start-up's dreams, strategies, product ideas and
open-source philosophy. Here's what I learned.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec8818"></a>Who is Indrema?</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;It was sort of a brainchild that my partners and I had,
while playing Quake late at night,&rdquo; said Gildred, looking back at
the genesis of his year-and-a-half-old start-up. &ldquo;We were
thinking: wouldn't it be great if somebody created an open-source
game platform so that a guy like John Cormack (of Quake fame), or
the next great developer of a new gaming paradigm, could get it to
market a lot quicker and could get into the [game] 'console space'
a lot easier?&rdquo;</p><p>Gildred and the other Indrema founders observed that there
were lots of innovations taking place for PC-based games, but not
much for consumer game consoles, due to high barriers to entry for
individual developers, which kept them from breaking into the
console market. So, they resolved to create a new game console. One
designed from the ground up, to provide a game development
environment and infrastructure capable of enabling any level of
developer&mdash;from an individual to a large corporation&mdash;to bring
products to market easily, and without huge barriers to entry. And
they decided that the keys to accomplishing this mission would be
open-source software, open APIs and the Linux operating
system.</p><p>The concept quickly gathered momentum. Developer interest was
high. Best of all, the required technologies appeared to be
available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec89d0"></a>What Will Indrema's Product Be?</h2></div></div><p>The Indrema Entertainment System (IES) is packaged in a sleek
enclosure with the look and feel of a top-of-the-line VCR.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4221f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The Indrema Entertainment System
</p></div></div><p>&ldquo;You don't know that it has Linux in it,&rdquo; said Gildred.
&ldquo;You turn it on, and it runs like a consumer electronics device.
You can watch TV as you normally would. But you can also pull up a
screen and start playing your MP3s. Or start the web browser and
begin browsing on the Internet.&rdquo;</p><p>The device offers a choice of broadband access, via its
built-in 10/100-megabit Ethernet interface, or a dial-up
connection. It comes with a game controller and will have at least
one pre-loaded game so the user can begin playing right away. There
are two ways to add games: by using the built-in DVD drive, or by
downloading games purchased on-line.</p><p>&ldquo;Isn't it, basically, a multifunction set-top box?&rdquo; I
na&iuml;vely asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Set-top box,&rdquo; replied Gildred, &ldquo;is a term that we run
away from!&rdquo; Gildred went on to explain that Indrema is determined
to avoid having the IES positioned as a set-top box. &ldquo;First and
foremost, it's a game console,&rdquo; emphasized Gildred. &ldquo;What the IES
does best is play games. It plays games very well, is extremely
fast, and offers an open development environment.&rdquo;</p><p>Nonetheless, that's not all the IES will do. After all, it's
a fully functional multimedia Linux computer. &ldquo;You will see
applications that are designed for an IES platform that go beyond
gaming,&rdquo; added Gildred, &ldquo;because it has a lot under the hood that
allows additional audio/video capability.&rdquo;</p><p>Some likely possibilities, mentioned by Gildred, include
providing enhanced HDTV capabilities and downloading and playing
music, video, and TV from content partner sites. Oh yes, and
&ldquo;Personal TV&rdquo;. Users will be able to download and play specific
TV programs on demand. Not all IES capabilities will be available
with the entry-level game console system. Personal TV, for example,
will be reserved as a high-end (extra-cost) option.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec8ea0"></a>What's in the Box?</h2></div></div><p>Let's take a look at what's inside that sleek Indrema box.
The core computer consists of a 600MHz x86-compatible processor
combined with a dedicated, and relatively customized, graphics
pipeline. The graphics subsystem includes MP3 and AC3
encoder/decoders, digital-to-analog converters, and a specialized
graphics processing unit (GPU) made by NVIDIA.</p><p>Memory is fixed at 64MB, but the hard drive can vary from 8
to 50GB depending on the console model. Of course, there's a
100MBps Ethernet port for fast Internet connection, plus a slew of
USB ports (4, in the baseline model) making game controllers&mdash;and
other devices&mdash;a snap to connect.</p><p>TV outputs will drive standard composite video, S-Video and
component HDTV. Inputs for composite video and S-Video are also
provided. On the sound side, there are stereo analog audio outputs
and inputs, plus a digital audio output port.</p><p>What CPU will Indrema use in the IES? That hasn't been
finalized yet, as far as the production models are concerned.
Gildred says it's going to be an as-yet-unannounced next generation
Intel or AMD processor&mdash;&ldquo;something new, very fast, and really
catered to what we're trying to do.&rdquo;</p><p>The system's internal electronic circuitry is modular in just
one respect: there is a slot (on the rear of the unit) for a
user-replaceable &ldquo;GPU card&rdquo; that houses the NVIDIA GPU and
associated video frame-buffer memory. Corresponding to this
modularity, Indrema has abstracted the GPU functionality in a
software driver, so that the system can adapt to future plug-in GPU
upgrades.</p><p>The four USB ports provide the main means for hardware
expansion. Since the IES represents a fully functional multi-media,
Internet-connected Linux computer, it's no surprise that Gildred
expects those ports to accommodate a wide assortment of
interfaces&mdash;beyond just game controllers. High-end models will
offer even more USB ports on their rear panels.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec9160"></a>What Makes It Tick?</h2></div></div><p>What makes the IES tick is, of course, its software.
Basically, there are three layers of software involved:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>an open-source Linux-based operating system, called
&ldquo;DV Linux&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>proprietary software components that are unique to
the IES platform hardware (these are distributed in binary form
only, and not open-source)</p></li><li><p>various application programs and games</p></li></ul></div><p>A free software development kit (SDK) will be distributed
on-line at the Indrema developer web site. That SDK will include
OpenGL, OpenAL, OpenStream and Extrema. The first three are open
source while Extrema, which is one of Indrema's proprietary
software components, will be offered in binary form only.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec9528"></a>Why Open Source? Why Linux?</h2></div></div><p>Despite the fact that Indrema intends to keep certain
software modules proprietary, the company is plainly a strong
advocate of open-source software. Indrema participates in several
open-source projects&mdash;including the Linux kernel, OpenAL and Mesa
3-D (the open-source implementation of OpenGL). In addition, the
company is pioneering a new open-source streaming video
architecture called OpenStream.</p><p>One of the most important Indrema projects has been to create
DV Linux, an open-source Linux distribution targeted at devices
using TVs for display. &ldquo;We want DV Linux to be the standard, and
we want people to realize that DV Linux is truly open source,&rdquo;
explained Gildred. &ldquo;That allows us to standardize on a game
platform so we can get a distribution [pipeline] going for all the
game developers. We're taking steps to be sure that this is
something that is supported by several players, not just Indrema.
DV Linux is a tool that enables the IES platform, including our
development environment, to be very open.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec9688"></a>Production Plans</h2></div></div><p>Although earlier announcements indicated a target delivery
date of the 2000 end-of-year holiday season, the current plan is to
begin shipment next spring. The target retail price for the
entry-level IES is rumored to be $299. Developers won't have to
wait as long. Indrema expects the free game development SDK to be
available for download by game developers this fall.</p></div></div>
