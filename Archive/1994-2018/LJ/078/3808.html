system administration in small businesses and home offices. Yet it
can be critical. If your entire business is riding on the contents
of your hard drive, and it goes belly-up, you are out of business.
Worse, you may be legally liable. For example, you may be required
to meet your payroll within a certain time after the end of the pay
period.
</p><p>For these reasons, what you spend on backup, including
software and tapes, is a form of insurance. To give one example, I
administer a home office with five computers (two Linux, two
Windows 95, and one that multiboots between Linux, Windows NT and
Windows 95), and two users. The network is standard 10-base T. I
have two tape drives (a Conner/Seagate 4GB Travan and an HP DDS 3
DAT drive) and routinely use two of the products I discuss
here.</p><p>Four backup programs for Linux are reviewed below:
PerfectBACKUP+, Arkeia, BRU, and Quick Restore. The first three are
available on the Web. Arkeia comes packaged with Red Hat, Mandrake
and SuSE distributions of Linux. Quick Restore is available on CD
only.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc7580.0x1ec0840"></a>PerfectBACKUP+</h2></div></div><p>This is the only completely &ldquo;no charge&rdquo; program in the lot,
and coming into such a program, I was not expecting much. I was
surprised, for example, to see support for tape changers, something
I would not expect to see on a low-end backup program. However, the
program qualifies as &ldquo;nagware&rdquo; by giving you a &ldquo;please
register&rdquo; window when you start up the program (see Figure
1).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3808f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. The Main Window of
PerfectBACKUP+</p></div></div>
</p><p>I was very pleased to see that it detected and correctly
identified both of my SCSI tape drives. Whether this facility
extends to other interfaces I cannot say. The two drives were not
associated with the correct device files in /dev, so I hand edited
that. A quibble indeed, compared to the setup problems I have had
with other tape backup software.</p><p>One thing that is very nice about PerfectBACKUP+ is that the
device selection menu identifies the drives by their names as
provided by the device. That is very useful; it saves having to
remember device names.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3808f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Selecting a Destination Drive for a
PerfectBACKUP+</p></div></div>
</p><p>PerfectBACKUP+ provides some easy-to-use minimal acceptance
tests, a facility I'd like to see on other backup software. One
quibble here is that I'd like to see the software test with larger
data sets to better exercise the tape drive. The data set is
unfortunately so small as to make the data rate result
meaningless.</p><p>Defining a backup set (or package, in PB's terminology) is
easy: go down the Backup pull-down menu and define each
characteristic in turn. Then select the Save As Package menu entry,
and give it a name. You can then recall the package and run it all
you want. I was able to define a small test backup set and make the
backup easily.</p><p>Unfortunately, the restoration had problems. I got a cryptic
message about &ldquo;This backup was made from / and you are about to
restore it to /test. If your backup was RELATIVE you might not want
to do this.&rdquo; Relative to what? Grepping the documentation, I found
no explanation of what the term &ldquo;relative&rdquo; means. It then asked
if I wanted to change the working directory. If I refused, it gave
me a cryptic error message. If I accepted, and retyped the working
directory I had previously selected, it made the restore where I
had asked for it.</p><p>This is the kind of glitch that indicates inadequate testing.
I can accept that sort of glitch in the GUI, as long as I can work
around it. But I am left with the question: what else was not
adequately tested? Also, PerfectBACKUP+ left defunct processes on
my test computer. This is not encouraging.</p><p>Verification is easy. In addition, after the fact&mdash;weeks or
months&mdash;you can pop a tape into a drive and verify it. You can
verify the contents of the tape against the original files, or you
can run a CRC checksum verification against the tape alone. This is
useful for verifying the reliability of your tape drive: remounting
a tape is a good test of the repeatability of head positioning, a
major casualty of wear in lower-end tape drives like QIC
tapes.</p><p>Unfortunately, I saw no way to verify a backup as part of the
backup sequence. This is something I have been accustomed to seeing
in PC backup software since Colorado Memory System's software
provided it in the late 1980s.</p><p>There are two sets of documentation. One is in HTML, and you
read it via Netscape. (What happens if you don't have Netscape?)
The documentation screen shots indicate an xterm interface with
mouse support; however, the provided interface is a full X GUI. The
other documentation is available from pull-down menus on the GUI.
It has no search function, and uses a fixed font which is
vanishingly small if you have a high-resolution monitor. The two
sets of documentation contain different material. Neither one
documents the command-line interface, which is a pity.</p><p>I must reluctantly conclude that PerfectBACKUP+ is not yet
ready for prime time. It needs serious testing in the GUI and a lot
of cleanup in the documentation. Because it left defunct processes
on my system during my tests, I don't trust it. PerfectBACKUP+ has
some excellent features, like identifying drives by name. I hope
Merlin fixes its problems and makes a more solid version
available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc7580.0x1eb7968"></a>BRU</h2></div></div><p>BRU is a modern replacement for tar (Tape ARchive). Many of
the command line options for BRU are identical to those for tar,
which means you can upgrade from tar to BRU fairly painlessly. In
addition, XBRU, the GUI, is merely a front end: all XBRU does is
build an appropriate command line and hand that off to the
command-line executable.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3808f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Main Screen of XBRU
</p></div></div><p>One feature that is missing from BRU is the ability to use
the GUI to build a command line, then export it for use in a
script. This would be a very useful tool for the
command-line-challenged.</p><p>The help is all on-line at EST, Inc.'s web site. This is
great if you don't mind going on line to read your docs, because
they are always the latest. What happens, though, when EST releases
a new version? Will your help still point to the web pages for the
version you have? Hey, guys: not everyone has a T1 connection to
the Net.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3808f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 12. Listing the Contents of a Volume in XBRU
</p></div></div><p>Installation is straightforward. I got the demo version from
the EST web site. It comes in a tar file. Copy it into its own
directory, untar it and execute <b  >./install</b>. The
installation script asks for information about your tape drives. It
will ask you for the capacity (uncompressed) and rewind and
non-rewinding device names. The devices ran with no further
changes. However, there are sample device definition files for a
number of drives on EST's web site.</p><p>You can run multiple XBRUs and simultaneously access
different tape drives. This is great for backing up to multiple
tape drives, but does not give the flexibility of Arkeia's
flows.</p><p>Verification of a backup is very useful. EST thinks you
should do it every time to verify the backup, and that's a good
idea. Their autoscan feature makes it easy to build into
scripts.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3808f13.large.jpg"><img src="3808f13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. A Tape Header in XBRU
</p></div></div>
</p><p>The professional version, which I did not review, will
provide a database of files backed up, thereby eliminating the
occasional need to read multiple tapes to find a given file.</p><p>One thing missing from BRU is support for tape changers. As I
have not worked with tape changers, I can't comment on their
reliability. But I'd rather have high enough capacity tape drives
and arrange my backup schedule so I don't need a tape changer.
Unfortunately (for system administrators, if not for users), the
ability of hard drive manufacturers to wedge capacity into their
products seems to exceed the ability of tape drive vendors to add
capacity to theirs. So there may be a tape changer in your
future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc7580.0x1eb82b0"></a>Arkeia</h2></div></div><p>Next in line is Arkeia, from Knox Software. Arkeia has a
three-part design. The server resides on the machine to be backed
up, and writes the backup with local file permissions and bits. The
server backs up and restores files; the client runs one or more
tape drives on a machine; and the user interface provides user
control over the other two parts. The user interface comes in two
flavors, command line and GUI.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3808f7.large.jpg"><img src="3808f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7. Selecting a Windows 95 Registry for Backup
in Arkeia</p></div></div>
</p><p>One implication of this design is that Arkeia's Windows
server, which runs as a native Windows process, can back up the
registry as metadata, not as just another file. However, there has
been some question about restoring registry backups on the Arkeia
user's list, so if you run Windows in your shop, make sure you can
do a full restore of the registry on a test computer before you are
satisfied with Arkeia's performance.</p><p>There is nothing that says that any one component has to
reside on the same machine as either of the other two. In my setup,
I run both the user interface and the tape client on the same
machine. I also run servers on that machine and each of the other
four computers on the network.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3808f8.large.jpg"><img src="3808f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 8. Selection Menu for the Root of a Windows
95 Computer in Arkeia</p></div></div>
</p><p>This architecture makes possible what Knox calls &ldquo;flows&rdquo;.
Most backup software simply walks a list of directories to back up.
(The brain-dead backup applet that comes with Windows NT is a
classic example.) Arkeia has each server feed its data to the
client, so that multiple machines are backed up simultaneously. In
my environment, each of the five computers is represented by a
&ldquo;flow&rdquo;. The result is very fast backups: to my HP DDS 3 DAT tape
drive, I get backups at a sustained rate of 57MB a minute, or 12GB
in under four hours. That data rate keeps the tape drive streaming,
which is important for tape and drive longevity. While I haven't
tried it, you should be able to back up multiple machines to
multiple tape drives. Under those conditions, Arkeia should
optimize data flow to keep all of the tape drives streaming.</p><p>Arkeia builds a database of files as it saves them to tape.
This is great because you can browse the contents of your tape
library without having to mount each tape in sequence. It also has
a weakness: Arkeia does not back up that database itself. That
means if the file system on which the database resides goes south,
you have to restore it from tape by reading each tape since the
last total backup. My solution to this weakness is to use BRU to
back up that file system.</p><p>When I first reviewed Arkeia for <i  >Linux Journal</i> (April 1999,
<a href="../060/3166.html" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/issue60/3166.html</a>),
I reported excellent customer support. While I have not used the
customer support recently, I must report some grumbling on the list
about it. This grumbling indicates that Knox's customer support has
gone downhill since I wrote the review. Perhaps the folks at Knox
think that a list is an adequate substitute for good customer
support; it is not.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3808f10.large.jpg"><img src="3808f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 10. An Arkeia Backup in
Progress</p></div></div>
</p><p>Setting up Arkeia initially is a lot of work. You first
define everything down to the individual tapes, which are lumped
into savepacks, then the drives, etc. Defining a backup is a matter
of selecting the savepack and the files to be backed up. Once you
have done that, you can run a backup at any time, manually or at
pre-defined times. The complexity of initial setup is the price of
Arkeia's extreme flexibility. A &ldquo;wizard-style&rdquo; interface would be
easier to use than the potentially confusing menus Arkeia uses.
Short of that, the manual walks you through the process of setting
up and running null device backups to verify your
installation.</p><p>Arkeia is probably the most ported of the lot. If you have
more than Linux and Windows NT, look at Knox's web site for a list
of supported OSes.</p><p>One thing missing from Arkeia is the ability to verify a
tape. Neither verification by comparison nor by checksum is
available. All I have been able to do is a partial restore to
another location and then comparison against the original, a
process that verifies only a portion of a tape. Of the four
products reviewed here, Arkeia is the only one with no form of
verification.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3808f11.large.jpg"><img src="3808f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 11. Arkeia's Main Window, Showing a Backup
Job in Progress</p></div></div>
</p><p>Arkeia is priced on a per-seat basis. For a quote, visit the
Arkeia web site. You can download a &ldquo;personal&rdquo; version. The
latter is restricted to one tape drive and a fixed number of
clients.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc7580.0x1eb8fc0"></a>Quick Restore</h2></div></div><p>Far and away the high-end product here is Quick Restore, from
Workstation Solutions, Inc.</p><p>Most Linux users are accustomed to downloading what they want
from the Net and trying out the package then and there. Workstation
Solution's evaluation process is quite different. Evaluation copies
are available on CD only. When you request a CD, the company
schedules an appointment to make the installation. At installation
time, a technician walks you through the installation. The request
process involves some e-mailing back and forth. During my efforts
to get an evaluation copy, someone (probably me) dropped the ball,
and it took me a while to get the CD and make an appointment.
Intentional or not, this process has the effect of filtering out
casual inquiries and casual users.</p><p>The actual installation process is straightforward. With most
installation software, there is either no help, or the help doesn't
answer the questions you want to ask. With a human being on the
other end of the phone, you can ask any question at any point in
the process, and get an answer. So this process represents a much
more user-friendly process.</p><p>The main window (see Figure 11) is a simple six-button
toolbar. Each button triggers a suitable separate window, in
classic X programming style. One result is that you can quickly end
up with a plethora of windows on your desktop. Another is that you
can move from window to window easily, unlike the typical Windows
application that only lets you use one window at a time.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3808f12.large.jpg"><img src="3808f12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 12. Selecting Files for
Restoration</p></div></div>
</p><p>Restoration is GUI-driven (see Figure 12). As with Arkeia,
the database of backed-up files is organized in a tree that
reflects the same structure as the backed-up file systems. Click on
one or more files to select them, then select the volume from which
to restore, insert the appropriate tape (unless you have a tape
changer) and away you go.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3808f13.large.jpg"><img src="3808f13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 13. Editing a Dataset in Quick
Restore</p></div></div>
</p><p>Unlike Arkeia, backups are defined with a scripting language
(see Figure 13). Quick Restore has a built-in editor for the
scripts. The bad news is that the editor is a brain-dead CUA
interface editor, rather reminiscent of MS-DOS' EDIT.COM. The good
news is that the files are plain vanilla ASCII text files you can
edit with any editor. Alas, if there is a mechanism for selecting
an external editor such as vi or emacs, I missed it in the
documentation. The scripting language is clear and well documented.
I was able to create data sets in quick order using emacs. The
built-in editor has a validator, which you should use often as you
edit.</p><p>Once you have defined a data set, it is necessary to schedule
a backup with it. You can schedule backups daily, weekly, monthly
or annually. There is no interactive backup facility; instead, you
schedule one for a minute from now and wait. At the time I
installed Quick Restore, the technician walked me through this
process (except for editing with an external editor) with a small
data set and a test backup.</p><p>Quick Restore also has a steep learning curve, but I think
not as steep as Arkeia's. Again, that's the price you pay for
flexibility. You can start using Quick Restore immediately by
carefully substituting qtar for tar in your existing
scripts.</p><p>Quick Restore also provides a number of command-line tools.
One is qtar, which will read and write tar format, and supports its
command-line options. These can be combined into shell scripts and
sample scripts are provided. Indeed, the GUI is a front end for the
command-line tools. It would be nice if the GUI could export
command lines for use in scripts. Another tool will tell you a lot
about your tape drive, including (if the drive supports it) whether
it is time to clean the drive.</p><p>Quick Restore is clearly intended for large shops, server
farms, data farms and similar high-data installations. It does not
even support the Travan tape drive. It does support my DDS 3 tape
drive, but the DDS 3 is in the low end of the tape drives it
supports. The difference, apparently, is that the DAT drive is
capable of a true random seek into the tape, where the Travan must
be read sequentially to get to a target block.</p><p>I found both the on-line documentation and the printed
documentation to be excellent. They are not duplicates, and each
serves their place well. You should read the printed documentation
before you install the software. I did not, and we got through the
installation fine, but there is information in the manuals that
might have helped. Indeed, the printed manual is a good
introduction to backups in general.</p><p>Quick Restore, like Arkeia, runs a background process on each
machine it backs up. At the moment, Quick Restore supports Linux, a
number of Unixes and Windows NT. It will back up Windows 95/98
boxes but only over SMB mounts. This has the disadvantage of
backing up the registry only as a standard file, which means the
backup administrator has to remember to add it to backups. You
should always back up the registry, as this is the only work-around
for an incredibly bad operating system design bungle in
Windows.</p><p>Of the four vendors whose products are reviewed here, only
Workstation Solutions uses the Network Data Management Protocol
(NDMP) to communicate between clients and servers. This emerging
Internet standard should eventually (as more vendors sign up) allow
interoperability between vendor products, and that should help
greatly in heterogeneous environments.</p><p>Quick Restore is not cheap. Workstation Solutions quoted me
$7,250.00 for a backup server, with an additional $1,595.00 (US)
for an annual service contract. Linux and FreeBSD clients are no
charge. NT clients cost $2,250.00, with an annual service contract
at $495.00. There is no &ldquo;home use&rdquo; option like that for Arkeia.
For that kind of money, customer support had better be excellent!
Other than the installation walk-through, I have had no contact
with Workstation Solutions' customer support, so I cannot tell you
how good it really is.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc7580.0x21ccf00"></a>Tape Formats</h2></div></div><p>PerfectBACKUP+ uses <b  >cpio</b> format, while
Quick Restore uses tar. Both were developed way back when, and may
not provide the data integrity of more modern formats. BRU, on the
other hand, clearly uses its own format. The advantage, according
to EST, is better data integrity; the disadvantage is that you must
use that tool to restore your data.</p><p>As far as I can determine, Arkeia has its own tape format.
They do provide a command-line utility that allows you to recover a
directory of a tape. You can then use this directory to restore
from that tape.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dc7580.0x21cd0b8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>The marketplace is wonderful. We see here solutions to the
problem of backups from vendors in all price ranges and all levels
of support; no Post-Awful &ldquo;One Size Fits All&rdquo; mentality.</p><p>One concern I have for backup programs is Windows NT backups.
Windows 2000 has more file descriptor bits than Windows NT. For
example, a file may be a sparse file. Also, Windows 2000 has file
system data structures called reparse points. Are the backup
programs that handle NT Windows 2000-aware? I don't see anything in
the literature of either of the two NT-aware programs reviewed here
that indicates one way or another. I do not have Windows 2000, so I
was unable to test this point. Workstations Solutions told me they
are working on it. Absent any claims that Arkeia support Windows
2000, presumably Knox also is working on it.</p><p>If you are spending other peoples' money, or have the budget
to buy software but don't have the staff to write your own
configurations, and you don't have any Windows 95 or 98 machines to
back up, go with Workstation Solutions' Quick Restore. Quick
Restore is far and away the best documented of the four products
reviewed here.</p><p>If you do have Windows 95 or 98 machines to back up over a
network, and are willing to learn and use a slightly confusing
graphical user interface, get Arkeia. Arkeia is also excellent for
sites with a lot of data to back up. The steep learning curve gives
you the flexibility to define a lot of different backup
configurations. This in turn allows you to get the most out of your
tape drives by keeping them as busy as possible.</p><p>In one area, Quick Restore is superior to Arkeia. If you have
multiple databases to back up, you want to shut down each one for
the shortest period possible. Short of exporting the entire
database, and then backing that up, the ideal is to shut down each
database, back it up, and then fire it up again, in sequence.
Arkeia allows you to execute a script before the backup, and
another after it. To minimize database downtime, you have to define
a separate backup for each database, a nuisance at best. Quick
Restore lets you insert scripts at any point in the backup process,
which means you can back up an entire computer, and only have each
of its databases down long enough to back it up. BRU's GUI has no
facility to run scripts at all, but the command-line interface is
excellent for writing your own. PerfectBACKUP+ does not appear to
have any facility to run scripts.</p><p>EST, Inc.'s BRU Professional appears designed to compete in
the high end, along with Arkeia and Quick Restore. Unfortunately,
it was not publicly available in time for this review.</p><p>The BRU-PE personal edition is an excellent choice for
backing up your own Linux machine and other machines over NFS or
Samba.</p><p>For a small- or medium-sized shop, I would seriously
recommend using Arkeia to back up the network, and then back up the
tape server with BRU. For complete protection, I would add EST's
Crash Recovery Utility or their QuickStart Data Rescue. As I have
an HP One-Button Disaster Recovery (OBDR) tape drive, the CRU looks
very attractive to me.</p><p>For home networks involving Windows, I would look at Arkeia's
shareware version, supported by backing up Arkeia's database with
BRU-PE or tar.</p><p><a href="3808s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3808_chart.jpg" target="_self">Table 1. Features
