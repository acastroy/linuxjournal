        Simple ways to secure your system.

notification? The message must contain more information than &ldquo;This
is a test of the emergency security broadcast system&rdquo;, if any
self-respecting system administrator is going to be able to act on
it. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Qu'est-ce que je vais faire avec toi?</em></span>
Fran&ccedil;ois, what are you looking at? What? Oh, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, forgive me. I did not notice your arrival. We were
setting up some new security policies on our Linux servers, and
Fran&ccedil;ois had written a script to detect my port scans and I
was completely distracted.</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois! Wine for our friends. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!
Vite!</em></span> Come, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Let me show
you to your tables. As you get comfortable, I should tell you about
this message my waiter had the system send out. I did a thorough
port scan on the system, and all he sends as notification is that
old &ldquo;This is a test of the emergency et cetera&rdquo; type of message.
Not much of a description, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? You know, when
I was younger and they had those messages on television, I always
suspected that if there had been a real emergency, we would not
have gotten the message because those who knew of the problem would
already have been in hiding. A little joke, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>. Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois. Yes. An excellent choice of
wine. You will like this one, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, a
superb 1995 Montrachet. Please pour, Fran&ccedil;ois.</p><p>Security, as you know, is very serious business indeed. Every
day, we hear of damage caused by viruses, of new exploits through
which crackers compromise systems. For those of us in the
information technology restaurant business, these are challenging
times. We must be ever vigilant. A good firewall, then, is an
excellent beginning. But how to do it simply is the question,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><p>The simplest way to secure your machine (short of locking it
up in the wine cellar with no Internet connection) is to disable
all nonessential services from your
<b  >/etc/inetd.conf</b> file and let your TCP wrapper
program control who gets in and who stays out. The three lines in
Listing 1 are samples from an <b  >/etc/inetd.conf</b>
file.</p><p><a href="4218l1.html" target="_self">Samples from an
<b  >/etc/inetd.conf</b> File</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111c580.0x1214b30"></a>Listing 1. Samples from an
<b  >/etc/inetd.conf</b> File</h2></div></div><p>Notice that the third line is commented out. That service
(rlogin) is simply not available on this system, while telnet and
FTP are. Now, the <b  >/usr/sbin/tcpd</b> you see is
actually the path to the TCP wrapper program. It decides whether
those services that are uncommented will be allowed as incoming
traffic. If someone tries to access services that are denied,
you'll get a log of that in your /var/log/secure file with a nice
&ldquo;refused&rdquo; message to let you know someone was being bad. Here's
how it is done.</p><p>Add the following line to your /etc/hosts.deny file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ALL:ALL
</pre><p>You start by denying all access by anybody. The first ALL
refers to all services. The second ALL simply means everyone. You
probably expected there would be a <b  >hosts.allow</b>
to counter the <b  >hosts.deny</b> file, and you are
correct. That file contains the hosts you want excluded from this
global refusal of service. Let's assume your internal network has a
base address of <b  >192.168.1.0</b>. The hosts we want
to be able to telnet or ftp to are the ones in that network. In the
/etc/hosts.allow file, you would put these entries:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ALL: 127.0.0.1&lt;
&gt;
ALL: 192.168.1.
</pre>


The dot after the <b  >1</b> means that
<b  >192.168.1.anything</b> is acceptable. The last thing
to do is restart the master network process, inetd. On most Linux
systems, it can be done like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/inet restart
</pre>


As I mentioned, this is pretty simple, but also covers some pretty
basic ground. Perhaps <span   class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> basic. For instance,
your TCP wrappers cover only those services listed in
/etc/inetd.conf. A better way to build a firewall is through the
use of ipchains, a packet filtering system for Linux machines
running kernels starting just before version 2.2. The ipchains
program is the successor to the older
<span   class="bold"><b>ipfwadm</b></span> program. Most newer
distributions will require ipchains for packet filtering.
</p><p>If you have read the ipchains documentation, you've probably
also felt a twinge of panic as you started to realize how complex
this can all be. I'll spend the next few paragraphs with some (I
hope) simple explanations of the process, then I will show you a
few recipes from some great open-source chefs that will make the
process less frightening and more fun.</p><p>Ipchains is a command-line utility that lets you create
packet filtering rule sets called &ldquo;chains&rdquo;. These chains come in
a few different flavors: <b  >input</b> (packets coming
in from the outside), <b  >output</b> (packets bound for
the outside world) and <b  >forward</b> (packets being
routed through your system, as in the case of ip forwarding and
masquerading). There is actually a fourth, which can be
user-defined and named. The format of the command is similar to the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ipchains -A forward -j MASQ&lt;
&gt;
     -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0
</pre><p>The <b  >-A</b> means to add a rule to the chain.
Other options are <b  >-D</b> to delete,
<b  >-R</b> to replace, <b  >-I</b> to insert,
<b  >-N</b> to create a new user-defined chain, and a
handful of others. The above command creates a rule set that will
forward packets from any host on my internal network and masquerade
them to appear as though all traffic was originating from one
machine only. The <b  >0.0.0.0</b> means the packet
destinations can be anywhere. The <b  >-j</b> flag
defines the action for this rule. Other than the above, which will
do masquerading for your site, you can also specify
<b  >ACCEPT</b> (let the packet through),
<b  >REJECT</b> (reject the packet, but let the other
side know it is being rejected) and <b  >DENY</b> (don't
allow the packet through and don't offer any explanation).
</p><p>What else can we do with this? For one thing, I could create
a pretty safe system by adding this single rule:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ipchains -A input -j DENY -s 0.0.0.0/0 -d&lt;
&gt;
0.0.0.0/0
No one will get into your system, and no one will ever know why. It might
be an idea, then, to insert this rule into the chain <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> you
do the above. Then at least your local network will have access to
your server.
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ipchains -I input -j ACCEPT -s&lt;
&gt;
192.168.22.0/24 -d 0.0.0.0/0
</pre><p>Let's try something a bit more complex. Starting from
scratch, I might set up the following input chain. Note that there
should be no broken lines here. Each command in the list begins
with <b  >/sbin/ipchains</b>. You will probably also
notice that my Internet address is an imaginary one. No IP address
starts with 259.
<pre     class="programlisting">
#&lt;
&gt;
# Input Rules
# /sbin/ipchains -F input
# /sbin/ipchains -P
input ACCEPT
# /sbin/ipchains -A input -j ACCEPT -s
192.168.1.0/24 -d&lt;
&gt; 0.0.0.0/0
# /sbin/ipchains -A input -j ACCEPT -s
0.0.0.0/0 -d 0.0.0.0/0
# /sbin/ipchains -A input -j DENY -p tcp -s
0.0.0.0/0 -d 259.25.132.55&lt;
&gt; 137:139
# /sbin/ipchains -A input -j DENY -p udp -s
0.0.0.0/0 -d&lt;
&gt; 259.25.132.55 137:139
# /sbin/ipchains -A input -j
ACCEPT -p tcp -s&lt;
&gt; 0.0.0.0/0 -d 259.25.132.55 80
# /sbin/ipchains -A
-d 0.0.0.0/0
</pre>


We start by &ldquo;flushing&rdquo; our input chain. That's the
<b  >-F</b> option at work. We then assign a default
policy of <b  >ACCEPT</b> with the <b  >-P</b>
option. The next two rules allow all traffic from our local network
and the outside world to enter. Next, we <b  >DENY</b>
all traffic bound for the netbios services (Windows or SAMBA file
sharing) at ports 137 through 139. A range of TCP ports is
expressed by a starting number, a colon and an ending number. Since
we do want to allow web server access on this mythical system, we
then open port 80. Finally, we catch anything that is still open
and does not fit the above rules by closing off access as earlier
with an all-inclusive <b  >DENY</b>.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mais oui</em></span>, the security-conscious
gentleman at table twelve questions my reasons behind starting out
with a policy of <b  >ACCEPT</b> instead of
<b  >DENY</b>. You are wondering, has Marcel been sipping
too much of his own wine? Well, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, when
contructing this example, I considered the creation of a rules set,
added line by line remotely, whether from your own internal
network, or from outside. If you <b  >DENY</b> everything
immediately, you deny yourself as well. Now, when it comes time to
script all these commands, you may want to consider setting up a
default <b  >DENY</b> policy rather than
<b  >ACCEPT</b>. Even so, when the rules are executed in
a script at boot time, with the final result being that you
<b  >DENY</b> anything that has not been specifically
ACCEPTed, the window for a cracker to exploit this policy is very
small.</p><p>At any point, you can list all the rules by typing
<b  >/sbin/ipchains -L</b>. You can also flush the table
of all chains, rule sets, etc. by typing <b  >/sbin/ipchains
-F</b>. This is by no means a complete firewall setup, nor is
it entirely realistic. In a real setup on a real server, there are
other ports I would like open (such as e-mail or DNS services). I
would also like to explicitly close access to my X window sockets
(ports 6000, 6001, etc.).</p><p>If the prospect of creating a firewall from scratch seems a
bit daunting and you would prefer a very quick-and-dirty approach
to a rules-based IP filtering system, look no further than the
&ldquo;ipchains-firewall&rdquo; script distributed by Ian Hall-Beyer. To
create a basic firewall, you need only call the script with your
outside interface and inside interface as the parameters. Here's
how I did it on my system with an external PPP connection:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ./firewall.sh ppp0 eth0
</pre><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4218f1.large.jpg"><img src="4218f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Running the firewall.sh
Script</p></div></div>
</p><p>As the script runs, it will set up masquerading, block out
remote access to things like netbios (SAMBA and Windows file
sharing) and X sessions. You can see the script in action in Figure
1. Using <b  >/sbin/ipchains -L</b>, you can list the
rules created by the script. Ian's script is the beginnings of a
firewall system, taking into consideration the &ldquo;usual&rdquo;.
Customization can be done just by editing the script, which you
will no doubt want to do. The defaults are fairly restrictive. For
instance, vital services like SMTP are, by default, denied. The
following example comes from the script itself, showing where I
have uncommented port 25 (among other things):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# telnet (23)&lt;
&gt;
# $IPCHAINS -A input -p tcp -s 0/0 -d $1 23 -j
ACCEPT
# echo -n "."
# smtp (25)
$IPCHAINS -A input -p tcp -s 0/0 -d $1 25 -j
ACCEPT
echo -n "."
# DNS (53)
$IPCHAINS -A input -p tcp -s 0/0 -d $1 53 -j
ACCEPT
$IPCHAINS -A input -p udp -s 0/0 -d $1 53 -j
ACCEPT
echo -n ".."
</pre><p>What? Ah, you are asking if we have anything with a bit more
spice on the menu. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mais oui</em></span>. For those who
prefer a graphical approach, I would like to recommend the
following two items, Easy Firewall and GTK+ Firewall Control
Center.
</p><p>The brainchild of Daniel Roche, Easy Firewall is a Tcl/Tk
(version 8) application that provides a nice simple interface for
firewall administration. For those out there running older Linuxes,
this application also works with
<span   class="bold"><b>ipfwadm</b></span>. The program is available
in a tarred and gzipped bundle or a Red Hat RPM. Since it is a
Tcl/Tk application, it's also very easy to work through the program
in case you happen to be curious. Installation is easy in either
case, since there is no compiling to do with the Tcl/Tk
script.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4218f2.large.jpg"><img src="4218f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. An EasyFw session</p></div></div>
</p><p>Easy Firewall comes with a few pre-defined firewall
configurations that are easily modified. Start the program with the
command <b  >easyfw</b>. The big friendly screen lets you
choose your internal and external interfaces at the click of a
button. It will then scan your system for any ipchains rules that
may already be in effect, and display them in the interface.
Modify, add or delete rules as you see fit. When you have a
satisfactory configuration, you can choose to
<span   class="bold"><b>Apply</b></span> that configuration to your
running network (now or at boot time) as well as save to a file.
The file option is great for a glimpse into the structure of the
firewall rules. Furthermore, since that file is a shell script, you
can call it from your /etc/rc.d/rc.local at boot time.</p><p>Our next offering comes from Koo Kyoseon, a little something
called the GTK+ Firewall Control Center. In the style of our
previous chef, Koo has built a clean, friendly interface to
ipchains administration. This program is available in either RPM or
source code format. If you will be building it from source, note
that you will also need the libipfwc library. Luckily, this is
included with the source for gfcc. At the time of this writing, I
picked up version 0.7.4 of the package,
<b  >gfcc-0.7.4.tar.gz</b>. Here are the steps for
building the package and the library:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf gfcc-0.7.4.tar.gz&lt;
&gt;
cd gfcc-0.7.4
</pre><p>Once inside this directory, we can build
<b  >libipfwc</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf libipfwc.tar.gz&lt;
&gt;
cd libipfwc
make
</pre>


Now, change back to the gfcc directory and build it:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd ..&lt;
&gt;
 ./configure  --with-ipfwc=./libipfwc
make
make install
</pre>


Start the program by typing <b  >gfcc</b>. This program
actually has two different ways of saving information. One is a
list of rules very much like what you will see if you look at the
existing rules in the <b  >/proc</b> file system. You can
do this by typing this command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cat /proc/net/ip_fwchains
</pre>


If you want a nice shell script like the one I mentioned earlier,
you can use the <b  >export</b> function to create the
script. For instance, if I export my rules to
<b  >/usr/local/.Admin/fwrules.sh</b>, I can load it the
next time I reboot by including that path as a single-line command
at the end of my <b  >/etc/rc.d/rc.local</b> script.

Way</p></div></div>
</p><p>Now that we have all these ideas on the table, let me make an
alternative serving suggestion. If you are really new to this and
you feel uncomfortable embarking on building your own firewall, use
Ian's <span   class="bold"><b>ipchains-firewall</b></span> script to
generate the initial set of rules. Then, use either
<span   class="bold"><b>EasyFw</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>gfcc</b></span> to modify the rules. It's an
easy way to get started on your way to a more secure system.</p><p>Alas, the clock, she is telling us that closing time is
near,<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Before you go, Fran&ccedil;ois will
refill your glasses a final time. Security is a vitally important
subject. Linux's powerful, network-ready architecture opens many
doors, including some you may prefer leaving closed. With a little
experimentation in the Linux kitchen, locking those doors need not
be a frightening experience. Until next time, I invite you to
network safely, and please, lock the door before you leave. We'll
see you next time at Chez Marcel. Your table will be
waiting.</p><p>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</p><p><a href="4218s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
