favorite operating system is a programmer's heaven. With dozens of
free compilers and interpreters for practically every language in
existence, source code available for most programs and the
programmer-oriented philosophy behind the system, Linux can easily
be described as a programmer's dream come true.</p><p>Sometimes, however, because there's so much out there, it's
hard to keep track of everything, especially for a newbie. That's
where the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Programming Bible</em></span> comes in. In
clear, concise writing, it shows both the forest and the trees of
the exciting world of Linux programming. Note in advance that only
a few topics are covered in deep detail; this book is more of a
reference and tutorial for beginners, not a comprehensive mammoth
of a book on one particular subject.</p><p>To start off the book, Chapter 1 introduces the Linux
environment and how it relates to programming, including how to
find documentation. The second chapter covers basic shell
programming and is enough to get you started writing simple scripts
which can serve as launchpads into more advanced shell programming.
The third chapter, which could very well be one of the most
important in the book, describes regular expressions in a fair
amount of detail. It also explains how to use them in Perl, sed,
awk and C/C++. Chapter 4 introduces the program that, in a sense,
started the whole Open Source movement: Emacs. Finally, to conclude
Part I, the fifth chapter covers the Linux file system layout, data
files (such as /etc/passwd and /etc/group) and initialization
scripts.</p><p>The second part of the book is devoted to the C/C++
environment. Chapter 6 gives an aerial view of gcc, with a few
close fly-bys as well; it covers the different parts of the
compiler, as well as some of the more commonly used options. The
seventh chapter introduces a tool that has made many projects far
easier to manage: GNU Make. It explains the basics of makefiles and
goes through a handful of examples, which are enough to get you
started. Chapter Eight covers memory management in Linux,
statically and dynamically allocated memory, as well as some fun
with those beloved pointers. The ninth chapter introduces both
static and dynamic libraries and tools to help you manage the
latter. When the inevitable bugs pop up, Chapter 10 is there to
help you squash them&mdash;it explains how to use gdb, the GNU
debugger.</p><p>Part III covers the Linux model, as the author describes it.
The eleventh chapter explains the UNIX philosophy of &ldquo;everything
is a file&rdquo;, and shows how to read and write from files. Chapter 12
introduces Linux processes: the basics, how to fork,
synchronization and security-related items. Chapter 13 covers
signals&mdash;handlers, sending/receiving and some dangers that
programmers need to be aware of. Chapter 14 introduces the Linux
I/O system, describing simple stream I/O, memory-mapped I/O, and
<b  >select()</b> and <b  >poll()</b>. Chapter
15 closes Part III with an explanation of terminals and how to make
sure your program acts nicely toward telnetters as well as toward
those accessing it directly.</p><p>Nice programs talk with other programs, and that's what Part
IV is about. Chapter 16 goes over shared memory and semaphores;
Chapter 17 explains how to use pipes and FIFOs; and Chapter 18
introduces you to TCP/IP (Internet) sockets. Sockets are covered in
more detail in Chapter 19.</p><p>Part V describes one of the most popular glue languages:
Perl. Chapter 20 introduces the language, explaining the data
structures and basic usage. Chapter 21 covers data
manipulation&mdash;reading data, parsing and processing it, storing it
and spitting it back out again. Perl has, in the eyes of many, been
inseparably associated with CGI, and that's what Chapter 22 is
about. Finally, Chapter 23 explains how to use Perl's database
interface (DBI) to access SQL databases.</p><p>While command-line interfaces are quite useful and sufficient
for many tasks, there are times when a graphical interface would be
better suited. The sixth part of the book contains two chapters on
the basics of X Windows from a programming viewpoint, Perl's (and
Python's) graphical toolkit (Tk) and basic Gnome
programming.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> made our lives easy.
CVS made them even easier. The first chapter of Part VII explains
the basics of CVS, including setting up your own repository,
checking out and committing code, and branching/merging code.
Chapter 27 describes some good security practices when writing code
for Linux and Chapter 28 covers optimization. At the end of the
book is a nice glossary that explains some of the more common terms
used in the book.</p><p>Is it worth it? Unless you're a wizened kernel hacker with
six or seven years of experience under your belt, the answer is
yes. The book is a good overview of many topics, covers the most
important subjects and can open your eyes to new, previously unseen
horizons. This is a must-have book if you're interested in Linux
programming.</p></div></div>
