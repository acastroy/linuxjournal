&ldquo;teck&rdquo;) or Leslie Lamport's LaTeX (&ldquo;lay-teck&rdquo;) can tell you
that both are extremely powerful but rather intimidating. LaTeX
makes things easier but it's still hard for a beginner to grasp the
connection between the marked-up text and the final, printed
output. Enter Bernice Sacks Lipkin's <span   class="emphasis"><em>LaTeX for
Linux</em></span>.</p><p>For those of you scratching your heads wondering what all
this TeX and LaTeX stuff is, read on. Donald Knuth wrote TeX so he
would be able to format his book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Computer
Science</em></span>, the way he wanted to. Rather than focusing on
the aesthetics of the printed output, Knuth wanted authors to
concentrate on the content of the material. As such, TeX is not a
word processor where you say, &ldquo;The section heading should be
larger than the other text, so I want font Becker at 14pt, and I
want it centered.&rdquo; Instead, you tell TeX you want a section
heading, and it automatically formats and numbers it for you. TeX
is still low-level, so Leslie Lamport wrote LaTeX, a collection of
higher-level TeX macros, to group some of the more common TeX
commands together.</p><p>Lipkin's book is a well-written guide to the narrow, twisting
path of learning LaTeX. First, I must say that the entire book was
typeset using LaTeX, and as such, it provides an excellent
real-life example of the various techniques within. This is a
definite boon when you're trying to figure out exactly what a
certain command does.</p><p>The first part of the book covers reading and understanding
LaTeX. As with most programming languages, to be able to write, you
must first be able to read. LaTeX is no exception. Chapter 1 covers
what a LaTeX command does&mdash;the meaning of all those backslashes and
curly braces. The second chapter defines concepts that TeX (and
thus LaTeX) uses, such as commands, declarations, environments and
scope. Chapter 3 explains LaTeX's document classes&mdash;letters,
slides, articles, reports, books and so on&mdash;and how to use
them.</p><p>Part II goes over things you'll need to prepare before you
can start writing serious LaTeX. The fourth chapter gives you a
practice template file to start working with. For die-hard Emacs
fans, Chapter 5 helps you assign key bindings in Emacs to common
LaTeX constructions. Since the whole point of LaTeX is to get your
text into a printed (or otherwise viewable) form, the sixth chapter
covers viewing and printing LaTeX files. You can convert LaTeX to
HTML, text, PostScript, PDF, etc. When the inevitable errors
happen, Chapter 7 will be there to help you deal with them.</p><p>The third part gets into the real meat of LaTeX. Chapter 8
covers the reserved single-character commands (such as the
backslash). In the ninth chapter, we move up to single-word
commands. Eventually, you'll get sick of typing the same
instructions over and over again. Chapter 10 explains how to use
macros and new commands to eliminate excess typing and
frustration.</p><p>Part IV covers formatting text. While the default Computer
Modern font LaTeX uses is nice, most people will want to use
something different at times. Chapter 11 gives the nitty-gritty on
everything you wanted to know about TeX's font system. When the
time comes to write something in another language, you can learn
from Chapter 12 how to place accents over and under characters.
Like HTML, TeX and LaTeX manage spaces for you&mdash;no matter how many
spaces you put between two words, LaTeX will always put in the same
amount of white space. While in most cases this is a good thing, at
times you'll need to tweak the amount of space, and the thirteenth
chapter explains how. Chapter 14 covers lists, and Chapter 15
explains how to align and indent text.</p><p>Figures, tables and marginal notes are called &ldquo;floating
objects&rdquo; in TeX, since you don't specify an exact location for
them. Instead, you tell LaTeX about where you want it to be (i.e.,
the top of the page), and it takes care of the rest. Chapter 16
explains how this possibly confusing feature works. Most academic
writings are littered with footnotes, so the seventeenth chapter
covers those. Chapter 18 describes the cross-referencing system,
and Chapter 19 explains how to add comments (text that LaTeX will
ignore, used mostly for writing notes to yourself) in your LaTeX
code.</p><p>LaTeX is commonly used for typesetting math equations, and
that's what Part V is all about. Chapter 20 goes over the math
symbols and the grammar for getting into and out of math mode.
Chapter 21 covers single-line math modes, and Chapter 22 explains
arrays (the multiline math mode).</p><p>The next few sections of the book consist of only one or two
chapters each. Part VI covers formatting in box mode; Part VII
explains how to insert pictures and graphics into your text; and
Part VIII shows you how to put the finishing touches
(bibliographies, tables of contents and indices) on your document.
Part IX describes how to design style sheets. The book ends with
two appendices&mdash;one on the construction of a root file, and the
other detailing how to convert from LaTeX to HTML and vice
versa.</p><p>While visual tools like LyX are available to make writing in
LaTeX less painful, many times you'll need at least a basic
understanding of the language in order to get the desired result.
This book will give you that understanding. It is well-written,
concise, informative, and laced with the occasional bit of humor.
Not many books are this thorough.</p></div></div>
