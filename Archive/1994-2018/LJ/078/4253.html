    Having UNIX and Linux coming from the same company will also
    make it
    much easier to get applications written, ported and supported in both
    environments.

called their UNIX-derived OS, before they pawned the PC version off
on Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in 1984. SCO, which had its own
version of UNIX, also bought UnixWare from Novell in late 1995.
UnixWare was Novell's name for the original AT&amp;T UNIX, which
Novell bought a couple years earlier for more than $100 million in
Novell stock.
</p><p>Some Novell engineers who worked on UnixWare are currently at
Caldera. And now they're getting it back. In early August, Caldera
acquired the Server Software and Professional Services divisions of
SCO. This now gives Caldera several kinds of UNIX to sell
(including Linux and UnixWare), while SCO gets a 28 percent stake
in Caldera in the form of 17.5 million shares of Caldera
stock.</p><p>How things have changed. In 1996, SCO sent spam faxes telling
people they could get a $50 trade-in on their copy of Linux by
upgrading to SCO UNIX. In October 1996, I asked Bryan Sparks, then
CEO of Caldera, about SCO. Specifically, I asked whether Caldera
would have a market if SCO had embraced Linux. At the time, SCO was
very big in the OEM/VAR market, which was where Caldera was headed.
Bryan agreed with my theory, pointing out that many of Caldera's
IVPs (Independent Vendor Partners) were from the SCO camp. (That
interview was published in the January 1997 issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>.) Now those camps will be in one
company: Caldera.</p><p>This is good for Linux. With one company offering a
choice&mdash;UNIX or Linux&mdash;the customer has to take the most useful and
market-ready alternative. Those of us who have been around for a
while know that in most cases, Linux outperforms SCO UNIX. But
making that choice isn't a no-brainer for companies that also have
to switch vendors and support organizations. Caldera's SCO
acquisition takes care of that problem.</p><p>Having UNIX and Linux coming from the same company will also
make it much easier to get applications written, ported and
supported in both environments. SCO's huge existing support
structure is a big win here.</p><p>Finally, SCO, Sequent and IBM have been working together on
the Monterey project, which aims to deliver a single UNIX product
line spanning the Intel IA-32, IA-64 and Power PC platforms. Having
all this cooperation under one roof&mdash;a Linux-based roof&mdash;is going
to make it much easier to go head-to-head with NT for server
solutions. Given a mix of Apache's current market penetration
(62.53%, according to Netcraft), SCO's global marketing and support
infrastructure and Linux, Caldera should give Microsoft a run for
its money in the server and e-business arena.</p></div></div>
