    Don writes about the expiration of the RSA patent and the
    impact it will have on the Linux community.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf57580.0x104f3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>This magazine should be coming out in
September, right about the time that RSA Inc.'s US Patent number
4,405,829 expires. If you get this before September 20, be sure to
visit the &ldquo;RSA Freedom Clock&rdquo; web site (see Resources) where you
can count down the days, hours, minutes and seconds. (There's no
legal precedent saying exactly what time a patent expires, so wait
a day or two after the clock runs down so you don't risk infringing
it.)
</p><p>What does the RSA patent cover? A lot of securitysensitive
software that uses public-key encryption, including both the Secure
Socket Layer implementations in commonly used web browsers and
servers, and version 1 of the SSH protocol, as commonly used for
secure remote administration. As I write this, Linux distributions
still can't legally distribute a lot of useful, interoperable
security software. That will change when the patent expires, and my
friends and I are going to have a big party somewhere in the
Silicon Valley area to celebrate. Check your local Linux user group
for the patent expiration party in your area.</p><p>Over the last year or so, we've heard a lot about how
software patents, which became legal in the U.S. in 1981, stifle
innovation. James Bessen and Eric Maskin conducted a study showing
that &ldquo;far from unleashing a flurry of new innovative activity,
these stronger property rights ushered in a period of stagnant, if
not declining R&amp;D among those industries and firms that
patented most&rdquo;. And a legal minefield of intersecting patents
threatens all software development, free or proprietary. Where the
software patent mess intersects with important basic security work
such as encryption, software patents interfere with the spread of
best practices and can be a major security problem.</p><p>Software patents hurt their holders, too, by skewing their
view of reality. Somehow, these patent holders assume that just
because people are giving them money, those people must like them.
Imagine a group of bandits who camp around a well in a desert and
begin charging travelers for water. Real bandits would keep their
weapons close by at night. But today's patent bandits seem to think
that people want to do business with them.</p><p>Unisys, for example, owns a software patent on a compression
algorithm called LZW, which is used in the Web's obsolete but
common GIF file format. Unisys's web site carries the preposterous
claim that &ldquo;demand for LZW-related technology by web developers
continues to grow&rdquo;, when web developers are simply using GIF for
compatibility with old browsers that don't support free formats
such as PNG. There's no love for Unisys here. Like the bandits
around the well, Unisys is getting paid because the travelers have
no choice for now. But unlike the bandits, Unisys seems to think
that the travelers are coming to them because they want to. When
enough of the browser-installed base supports PNG, Unisys can say
good-bye to their royalties, and the Web can say good riddance to a
pretty dumb bunch of bandits.</p><p>RSA Security, Inc. is another set of bandits who are going to
get a surprise right about now. Behind all their fluffy talk of
&ldquo;partners&rdquo; and &ldquo;solutions&rdquo;, they're just charging people to
draw from a well that U.S. taxpayers helped dig when we funded
crypto research at MIT. As a nation, we give educational
institutions special tax treatment. This isn't just because they
grade our papers and answer our questions during office hours.
Educational insitutions are about research, too, about extending
the scope of useful human knowledge. Doing research as a non-profit
and patenting the good parts for profit is a big ripoff any way you
look at it. When the IRS finally starts raiding the big research
&ldquo;universities&rdquo; such as MIT and google.com's little tax shelter,
Stanford, I'll throw another party.</p><p>With a little scrutiny, and hopefully some long-awaited
software patent reform, patent bandits will start to fade away as a
security threat. The U.S. government's National Institute for
Standards and Technology is selecting an algorithm as the new
national Advanced Encryption Standard, and they're alert enough to
not let the next RSA or Unisys seize control of the well. The AES
web site says, &ldquo;NIST hereby gives public notice that it may seek
redress under the antitrust laws of the United States against any
party in the future who might seek to exercise patent rights
against any user of AES that have not been disclosed to NIST in
response to this request for information&rdquo;. Which is basically
bureaucrat-speak for &ldquo;try to run a patent burn on us, and we will
go John Woo on your sorry ass&rdquo;.</p><p>Thank you, NIST. But the next great threat to Linux security
comes not from corporate software patenteers or government agencies
seeking &ldquo;IP Wiretaps Everywhere&rdquo;. Since earlier this year, the
bad old U.S. crypto export regulations are effectively gone if you
make your source freely available. The threat comes from within. If
you do a Linux distribution, pay attention. After this month, there
is no excuse not to supply the best industrial-strength crypto
available. So there's no excuse not to make security a design
consideration instead of a sheepish warning after a distribution
ships with a hole. Free clue with the purchase of every magazine:
read the OpenBSD security page, and do that. If you can't afford to
be in the security business, you can't afford to be in the Linux
business.</p><p>At <i  >Linux Journal</i>, we expect to see
OpenSSL and OpenSSH well-integrated into the distributions. That's
the easy part. Here's the hard part: don't load users up with
potentially exploitable services. Please, don't let Marketing talk
you into shipping Linux with a loaded gun duct-taped to the user's
foot, just so you can put one more checklist feature on the
package. The person who wants to install Linux at his or her
company gets set back in the struggle every time someone publishes
a security flaw in SquirrelTech Linux's network acorn-balancing
d&lt;\#230&gt;mon. I don't care what all nifty-keen new software
you offer&mdash;any user who wants his box to be a virtual food court of
services should ask for it. The Bastille Linux project is an
important step in the right direction, but its very existence shows
that the mainstream Linux distributions are thinking about security
about as much as a hog thinks about Feynman diagrams. The users who
need security most&mdash;the beginners&mdash;aren't getting it right out of
the box.</p><p>The world needs security-aware network administrators now
more than ever. But a user shouldn't have to be one just to run
Linux. If you ship a distribution with an installation designed for
Joe Six-Pack, and a security posture so wide open that you need to
be Rick Moen to lock down, then something is terribly, terribly
wrong. And you don't have an excuse any more. &ldquo;We can't ship
crypto.&rdquo; Wrong. See above. &ldquo;Users expect standard services.&rdquo;
Wrong. Maybe UNIX-using graduate students do; regular people expect
security. &ldquo;Don't worry, it'll be behind the firewall.&rdquo; Wrong.
It's hanging out buck naked on a DSL connection. Or maybe it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> the firewall. &ldquo;If we change it, it'll be
harder to support.&rdquo; Wrong. How easy is it to &ldquo;support&rdquo; a root
compromise? Thanks to the RSA patent's expiration, the time for
security excuses is over. Don't let marketing weenies make security
policy, and you'll be issuing a lot fewer security
advisories.</p><p><a href="4254s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
