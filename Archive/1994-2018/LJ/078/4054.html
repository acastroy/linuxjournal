    Armed with Linux and open-source tools, you can even keep an ISP secure.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd5580.0x1ccd558"></a></h2></div></div><p>As an ISP, we are the most vulnerable to
attack because of the open nature of our networks. Unlike corporate
networks, which can limit access, and can backtrack users, we have
to continuously monitor for attacks and, more importantly,
successful intrusions. We use several open-source security tools to
monitor for intrusions and system compromises. These tools have
alerted us to attack and allowed us to quickly respond to
intrusions from system compromises.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd5580.0x1ccd660"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>System administrators are known to be trained paranoids. They
are not only concerned about updating their systems against the
latest program vulnerability, hacking tools and kiddie scripts, but
they have to be vigilant against the security holes and exploits
that are not known or documented. Most good system administrators
can protect their systems against low-level crackers by using
standard system hardening techniques (&ldquo;Post-Installation Security
Procedures&rdquo;, <i  >Linux Journal</i>, December 1999).
It is the holes that are not known, and the knowledgeable cracker
that poses the much greater danger.</p><p>Intrusion detection and recovery is a goal of all system
security. It usually involves looking for system compromises:
checking logs for unusual activity, unusual connections, and
alterations in the system files. Of course a system must be secured
in order for intrusion detection and recovery to be effective.
System administrators would be working double time if they kept
finding people breaking into their systems and had to recover from
them.</p><p>There are many open-source tools available to system
administrators to aid in this process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd5580.0x1ccd870"></a>Intrusion Detection</h2></div></div><p>We use Tiger, Logcheck and Tripwire in cron jobs to
continuously monitor the system for incursions and intrusions. They
alert us to attacks on our system and allow us to quickly respond
to the attack or limit the damage. We also use other security
programs, but to allow this article to be manageable, we shall
concentrate on programs with stable releases.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd5580.0x1ccd978"></a>tiger-2.2.4</h2></div></div><p>Tiger is a set of scripts that search a system for weaknesses
which could allow an unauthorized user to change system
configurations, gain root access, or change important system files.
System administrators may remember Tiger as the successor to COPS
(Computer Oracle and Password System).</p><p>Tiger was originally developed at Texas A&amp;M University
and can be downloaded from
<a href="ftp://net.tamu.edu/pub/security/TAMU" target="_self">net.tamu.edu/pub/security/TAMU</a>.
There are currently several versions of Tiger available:
tiger-2.2.3p1, the latest Tiger with updated check_devs and
check_rhost scripts; tiger-2.2.3p1-ASC, tiger-2.2.3p1 with
contributions from the Arctic Regional Supercomputer Center;
tiger-2.2.4p1, tiger-2.2.3 with Linux support; and, TARA, Tiger
Analytical Research Assistant, an upgrade to tiger-2.2.3 from
Advanced Research Corporation.</p><p>Tiger scans the system for cron, inetd, passwd, files
permissions, aliases and PATH variables to see if they can be used
to gain root access. It checks for system vulnerabilities in inetd,
host equivalents and PATH to determine if a user can gain remote
access to the system. It also uses digital signatures, using MD5,
to determine if key system binaries have been altered.</p><p>Tiger is made up of scripts which may be run together or
individually. This allows system administrators to determine the
best strategy for checking their system depending on system size
and configuration. The Tiger script files are available for
download at
<a href="../listings/078/" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue78</a>.</p><p>Tiger can be used as an interactive process, or configured to
run any or all the scripts using the tigerrc file. In addition, a
site file must include the locations of files Tiger may use, such
as Crack and Reporter. Sample tigerrc and site files are included
in the distribution. We usually start with everything turned on in
the tigerrc and the site-sample files, and customize which scripts
to run after the initial audit. Tiger can be run by typing ./tiger
in the Tiger directory. Using Tiger as an interactive operation
will run the Tiger scripts without regard to the amount of time it
takes to complete.</p><p>The individual checks can be spread out over time using the
tigercron script without cluttering up your crontab file. Tigercron
uses the cronrc file to schedule the tiger scripts in a manner
similar to crontab. Tigercron is a little bit different from the
conventional crontab process in that tigercron is run in crontab
every hour, and then tigercron, using cronrc in the tiger
directory, determines which scripts to run. One advantage of
tigercron is it is configured to e-mail a security report only if
there is a change from the previous scan. This prevents cluttering
the system administrator's e-mail with status information and
creates a red flag for the sys admin that the system has changed
and to take notice of a possible intruder whenever a Tiger e-mail
is generated.</p><p>Tiger outputs a security report upon completion. The output
is detailed and prefixed by cryptic error messages. Fortunately,
Tiger comes with a utility to explain error messages, called
tigexp. A explanation of each error message can be obtained by
running <b  >tigexp -f &lt;report
filename&gt;</b>.</p><p>Tiger 2.2.4 has been updated to run with Red Hat Linux using
a 2.0.35 kernel. This is great for people who use Red Hat 5.1 and
have not upgraded. Systems using other flavors of Linux, or those
that have been upgraded will have to update their binary signature
file by using the util/mksig script. This allows Tiger binary
checks to be updated as new programs are upgraded or
installed.</p><p>Tiger is an important part of our system integrity monitors.
It is proactive in checking for ways root can be compromised and
scans for changes in important system files. In the past, we have
been alerted to system intrusions because of Tiger.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd5580.0x1ccde48"></a>Logcheck 1.1.1</h2></div></div><p>Logcheck is a script that scans system log files and checks
for unusual activity and attacks. This assumes that an intruder has
not gained root privileges to a host and cannot alter the log
files. One of the big problems with keeping good log files is a lot
of information gets collected. Manually scanning log files could
take days on large systems. Logcheck streamlines the task of system
log monitoring by categorizing the logged information and e-mailing
it to the system administrator. Logcheck can be configured to
report only the information you want to see and to ignore all
information you don't want to see. Logcheck can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.psionic.com/tools/logcheck-1.1.1.tar.gz" target="_self">www.psionic.com/tools/logcheck-1.1.1.tar.gz</a>.
It is part of the Abacus Project, an Intrusion Prevention
System, however, not all the other components are at stable
releases yet. Logcheck is based on a log-checking program called
frequentcheck.sh, part of the Gauntlet Firewall Package.</p><p>The logcheck.sh script is installed into /usr/local/etc/
along with the keyword files. The script can be downloaded at
<a href="../listings/078/" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue78</a>.</p><p>Logcheck scans the log files for active system attacks first,
then security violations, and then unusual system events. Logcheck
then e-mails a report to root (see Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4054f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Logcheck Operation
</p></div></div><p>In this sample Logcheck e-mail, I purposely logged on to my
system from a host that was not allowed to connect, and then used
some common hacking probe commands on my sendmail port. Logcheck
detected the attempt to gather userids using sendmail and listed it
as an &ldquo;Active System Attack Alert&rdquo;. It found that a user ftp'ed
on to the system in the &ldquo;Security Violations&rdquo; section; they may
have misspelled their legitimate user ID, or may be a cracker
probing the system for user IDs. It also found system trying to
connect to us that is not allowed to connect.</p><p>Finally, in the &ldquo;Unusual System Events&rdquo;, anything out of
the ordinary that is not specifically ignored is shown. Logcheck
creates a .offset file to mark the portions of logs it has scanned
to avoid repeating information it has previously processed.</p><p>Logcheck is based on the assumption that syslog is configured
to log as much information as possible, and, if possible, to log
all activity to one file for easier parsing. Parsing only one file
ensures that information will not be missed. We logged all our
information to /var/log/messages in addition to the standard log
files. This requires more disk space, but it makes debugging system
problems easier. Logcheck is heavily biased toward Firewall Toolkit
and BSDish messages from TCP wrapper. Systems not using Firewall
Toolkit or TCP wrappers may need to add keywords for their
security/monitoring programs.</p><p>Logcheck is useful only to help administrators spot attacks
and take precautionary measures, but once a intruder gains access
to your system, one of their first steps will be to hide their
tracks by disabling logging.</p><p>We use Logcheck as a tool to monitor attacks on our system,
intrusion activity and system problems. We pay specific attention
to individual attacks on our system and cross reference older
Logcheck outputs to try to establish patterns of probing and
attacks that occur over weeks or months. The distributed or
time-spaced probing of our system is considered high-priority
because it usually shows a determined or organized attacker with
the patience to look for, and take advantage of, new exploits and
program holes. We run logcheck in cron daily, and change to an
hourly check if we suspect active probing or attacks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd5580.0x1cce420"></a>Tripwire</h2></div></div><p>One of the best-known and most useful tools in intrusion
detection and recovery is Tripwire. Tripwire creates a signature
database of the files on a system, and when run in compare mode,
will alert system administrators to changes in the file system.
Tripwire is different from Tiger in that it is a dedicated file
signature program, which can use multiple hash functions to
generate digital signatures.</p><p>Tripwire was developed for the Computer Operations Audit and
Security Technology (COAST) laboratory at Purdue University. The
publicly available version, Tripwire version 1.2, is available from
<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/coast/archives" target="_self">www.cs.purdue.edu/coast/archives</a>
Tripwire version 1.2-2 is shipped with Red Hat on the
powertools CD as RPMs and is also available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/powertools" target="_self">ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/powertools/</a>.
Tripwire has been available as a commercial product since January
1999 from Tripwire Inc. Tripwire 1.3 is distributed as an Academic
Source release. 2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
versions are available in binary-only form. Both can be downloaded
from
<a href="http://www.tripwire.com/downloads/index.cfml" target="_self">www.tripwire.com/downloads/index.cfml</a>for
noncommercial use. Tripwire Inc. has announced it will be adopting
an open-source model for Tripwire by the third quarter of 2000, but
has not yet settled on a licensing scheme.</p><p>A great many articles about Tripwire exist, so we will
concentrate on using Tripwire as an intrusion detection tool rather
than how to use Tripwire.</p><p>As I mentioned before, when an intruder penetrates a system,
one of the first things they will try to do is hide themselves and
their activities from the system. In order to accomplish this, they
will commonly substitute system files with Trojan horse
binaries&mdash;binaries with code added to them&mdash;which filter their
activities. Common Trojan binaries are TELNET, login, su, FTP, ls,
netstat, ifconfig, du, ps, inetd and syslogd. Intruders will also
try to create back doors for themselves by adding a user to passwd
or a service to inetd. In most cases, they will try to take the
/etc/passwd file and run Crack on it hoping to find users with weak
passwords.</p><p>Intruders will also install tools to allow them to monitor
the network or maintain access to a system. They will try to
install programs with known vulnerabilities to allow them to gain
root access, often in &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; files. They may also install
network scanners, and probes to collect information and possibly
passwords from network traffic sent in clear text.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4054f2.large.jpg"><img src="4054f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Tripwire Operation
</p></div></div><p>Tripwire as an intrusion-detection tool requires a pristine
image database of the system, a snapshot of your system in a known
uncompromised state. The best scenario (see Figure 2) is to be able
to take a clean snapshot or &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; when the system is
first installed. As programs are installed and upgraded, the system
administrator compares the new file signatures to make sure only
the programs they worked on are updated to the database and that no
other system files were altered.</p><p>Capturing the digital signature of the entire file system can
create an information overload for the system administrator. Parts
of the file system are supposed to be changed with normal
operations, so capturing the files in /var/spool, /tmp, or even
/var/log can be useless because they are constantly being altered.
At the same time, we need to be able to identify files hidden in
the system if we detect a compromise. To accomplish the different
need of the scans, we create two Tripwire configuration files with
two Tripwire databases: one to scan the entire system and one to
scan only critical system files.</p><p>System administrators have different opinions as to which
files are &ldquo;critical&rdquo;. We take the view that system binaries and
libraries should not change unless we change them. So all *bin and
*lib directories, such as /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /lib
and /usr/lib should be fingerprinted by Tripwire. In addition, all
system configuration files in /etc should be fingerprinted. The
files and directories to be scanned can be configured using
tw.config. We can redirect the config file and database to be used
by using the -c and -d switches of Tripwire.</p><p>Tripwire can be used as an intrusion-detection tool by having
it run comparisons as a cron process. Any system files that were
altered without the system administrator's knowledge would be a
sign that the system has been compromised and that immediate action
needs to be taken to limit the damage. Clear signs that a system
has been compromised are changes to system files involved in login,
access privileges, and process monitoring or accounting.</p><p>When an intrusion is detected or suspected, Tripwire can give
the system administrator an indication of the extent of the damage
by identifying the files that have been changed. If an intrusion
has been detected early, the cracker may not have had time to
penetrate the system, and may have had time only to start the
process by bringing over tools and programs. This is where the
fingerprint of the full system is valuable. Using a full scan of
the system, hidden files and directories can be identified and
investigated. Rather than manually scanning the file system for new
directories and files, Tripwire will flag them and output them to
the Tripwire report.</p><p>A knowledgeable cracker, one who knows about intrusion
detection, will commonly try to hide programs in the file structure
where they knew the system files would be changed during normal
operations, thereby hiding themselves from abridged cron Tripwire
comparisons. Places where a system adminstrator should pay especial
attention is /tmp, /dev and /var/spool directories because files
are created and deleted during normal operations. Crackers will try
to hide their directories by prefixing them with . (dot), so they
do not show in a normal ls command.</p><p>File integrity checkers should be a part of every system's
security; Tripwire is the &ldquo;best of breed&rdquo; in this area. It can be
used as an alarm to a system penetration and in intrusion
recovery.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd5580.0x1ccec60"></a>Intrusion Recovery</h2></div></div><p>When an intrusion has been detected, the system administator
needs to first regain control of the compromised system by
disconnecting it from the network. This is to prevent further
intrusion and possible Denial of Service attacks on the Internet
originating from the compromised host. An image of the system
should be backed up to allow for the intrusion to be analyzed and
referenced later.</p><p>The system must then be analyzed thoroughly by reviewing log
files. This is a primary source of information on how, when and
where the intrusion occurred. All system binaries and configuration
files, including the kernel, need to be verified to make sure they
are unaltered. To do this, the system administrator must first
insure the system analysis tools themselves are clean and do not
contain Trojans. System data should also be checked to make sure
the intruder has not changed them. Intruders may &ldquo;park&rdquo; data or
programs on the system. This may include programs to be used in
other intrusions, and data from other compromised systems.
Intruders may also install network sniffers and other monitoring
programs in hopes of capturing information which will allow them to
access other hosts. Once an intrusion has been detected on one
system, all the other systems on the network should also be checked
for possible intrusion. The intruder may have used the compromised
system to gain access to other hosts on the network, or they may
have used other hosts to gain access to the system with the
detected intrusion.</p><p>System administrators should file an incident report for all
hosts compromised with a computer coordination center, such as
CERT. Intruders usually use compromised accounts to attack other
system. It is difficult or impossible for an individual system to
track down the origins of a knowledgeable attacker. However, it is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>made</em></span> possible through cooperation among system
administrators, closing down avenues of attack and access, limiting
the attacker to hosts and systems where they can be monitored and
identified.</p><p>Once an intrusion has been analyzed and reported, then comes
the task of recovering from the intrusion. First a clean version of
the system should be installed, preferably from the original
installation media. If a backup is used, the system binaries should
be restored from copies with known clean binaries. The sys admin
should take the paranoid stance that the latest backup may contain
the altered programs and data and needs to be sure they are not
reinstalling bad files.</p><p>Once a compromised system has been restored, it must be
secured to prevent another intrusion. Steps in hardening a system
include disabling all unnecessary services, installing all vendor
security patches, consulting CERT and other security advisories,
and changing passwords.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bd5580.0x20c7170"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Detecting and recovering from an intrusion may actually be
the start of a system administrator's security journey. Intrusions
only highlight the need for system security. With millions of users
on the Internet, one has to assume that, while individually they
may pose minimal threat, collectively they are more knowledgeable
and have more resources than any system administrator or security
program.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Bobby S. Wen (wen@vasia.com) holds two
