    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdb39d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>E-mail is easily the most popular and
important Internet service today, which has made it a popular
target of cyber-criminals and spam-happy miscreants. Adding to the
problem is the inescapable reality that configuring sendmail, the
most commonly used Mail Transfer Agent (MTA), is complicated,
nonintuitive and easy to get wrong.
</p><p>Wietse Venema, intrepid developer of TCP wrappers and
co-creator of SATAN, has come through for us again: his program,
<span   class="bold"><b>postfix</b></span>, provides an alternative
to sendmail that is simpler in design, more modular, easier to
configure and less work to administer. Equally important, it's been
designed with scalability, reliability and sound security as
fundamental requirements.</p><p>This article is intended to bring you up to speed quickly on
how to use postfix on your network as a secure means of receiving
e-mail from and delivering it to Internet hosts. In particular
we'll focus on deploying postfix on firewalls, in DMZs and in other
settings in which it will be exposed to contact with untrusted
systems.</p><p>Is sendmail really that bad? That depends on what you need it
to do&mdash;the learning curve may not be justified if your e-mail
architecture is simple. But sendmail is unquestionably an extremely
powerful, stable and widely deployed application that isn't going
away anytime soon, nor should it. In fact, The Paranoid Penguin
will probably feature a sendmail article some time in the next few
months.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdb3c38"></a>Background: Mail Transfer Agents</h2></div></div><p>Both sendmail and postfix are Mail Transfer Agents. MTAs move
e-mail from one host or network to another. These are in contrast
to Mail Delivery Agents, which move mail within a system (i.e.,
from an MTA to a local user's mailbox, or from a mailbox to a file
or directory). In other words, MTAs are like the mail trucks (and
airplanes, trains, etc.) that move mail between post offices; Mail
Delivery Agents are like the letter-carriers who distribute the
mail to their destination mail boxes.</p><p>In addition to MTAs and MDAs, there are also various kinds of
e-mail readers, including POP, POP3, and IMAP clients for
retrieving e-mail from remote systems. These are also known as Mail
User Agents, or MUAs. (There is no real-life simile for these,
unless your mail is handed to you each day by a minion whose sole
duty is to check your mail box now and then!) But we're not
concerned with these or with MDAs, except to mention how they
relate to MTAs.</p><p>By the way, if you still use UUCP, it's supported in postfix
(and continues to be in sendmail, too); most MTAs support a variety
of delivery &ldquo;agents&rdquo;, almost always UUCP and SMTP at the very
least. Still, for the remainder of this article we'll assume you're
interested in using postfix for SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol) transfers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdb3df0"></a>SMTP Gateways and DMZ Networks</h2></div></div><p>One very common use of SMTP, especially in organizations
which use <span   class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> e-mail protocols internally,
is on an Internet e-mail gateway. Since SMTP is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>lingua franca</em></span> for Internet e-mail, there must
be at least one SMTP host on any network that needs to exchange
e-mail over the Internet. In such a network, the SMTP gateway acts
as a liason between non-SMTP mail servers on the inside and SMTP
hosts on the outside.</p><p>This &ldquo;liason&rdquo; functionality in and of itself isn't as
important as it once was; the current versions of Microsoft
Exchange, Lotus Notes, and many other non-SMTP-based e-mail server
products have no problem communicating with SMTP servers directly.
But there are still reasons to have all inbound (and even outbound)
e-mail arrive at a single point, the chief reason being
security.</p><p>There are two main security benefits to using an SMTP
gateway. First, it's much easier to secure a single SMTP gateway
from external threats than it is to secure multiple internal e-mail
servers. Second, separating Internet mail from internal mail allows
one to move Internet mail transactions off the internal network
entirely. The logical place for an SMTP gateway is in a DMZ
(&ldquo;Demilitarized Zone&rdquo;) network, separated from both the Internet
and the internal network by a firewall.</p><p>As with DNS, FTP, WWW and any other publicly accessible
service, the more protection you can place between potential
hackertargets and your internal network, the better. Adding an
extra NIC to your firewall, keeping public services in a separate
network, is one of the cheapest and most effective ways of doing
this&mdash;as long as you configure the firewall to carefully restrict
traffic to/from the DMZ). It's also good risk management; in the
(hopefully) unlikely event that your web server, for example, is
compromised, it won't become nearly as convenient a launch pad for
attacks on the rest of your network.</p><p>(For additional information on the DMZ technique of
firewalling, see the article &lt;/#147&gt;Securing DNS and
BIND&lt;/#148&gt;, page 92 of this issue.)</p><p>Thus, even organizations with only one e-mail server should
still consider adding an SMTP gateway, even if that e-mail server
already has SMTP functionality.</p><p>But what if your firewall <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> your FTP
server, e-mail server, etc.? Although the use of firewalls for any
service hosting is scowled upon by the truly paranoid, this is
common practice for very small networks (e.g., home users with
broadband Internet connections). And, in this foul-weather
paranoiac's opinion, BIND and postfix pose much less of an exposure
for a firewall than other service applications.</p><p>For starters, DNS and SMTP potentially involve less direct
contact between untrusted users and the server's file system. (I
say &ldquo;potentially&rdquo; because it's certainly possible, with badly
written or sloppily configured software, to create extremely
insecure DNS and SMTP services.) In addition, both BIND and postfix
have &ldquo;chroot&rdquo; options and run as unprivileged users, two features
that help reduce the danger of either service being used to somehow
gain root access (we'll discuss both of these options in depth
shortly.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdb4268"></a>Postfix Architecture: How Does Postfix
Work?</h2></div></div><p>To understand how postfix works, it's useful to consider its
background. The main purpose for postfix's existence is sendmail's
complexity. Postfix is a full-featured MTA, and therefore its core
functions are the same as any other's. But postfix was written with
unusual attention to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Security.</b></span> Postfix
was designed with security as a fundamental requirement rather than
as an afterthought. It's obvious that Mr. Venema has taken the
lessons of history (as chronicled by CERT, bugtraq, et al.) very
much to heart. For example, the system doesn't trust any data,
regardless of its source. And with least privilege in a chrooted
jail (see below), risks are reduced. Furthermore, protective
measures against buffer overflows and other user-input attacks have
been implemented. If something still fails, postfix's protection
mechanism tries to prevent any of the processes under its control
from gaining rights they shouldn't have. Since postfix is comprised
of many different programs that function without a direct
relationship to each other, if something goes wrong, the chance
that such a problem can be exploited by an attacker is minimized.
Of course, we all know that no system is 100% secure; the goal must
be to minimize and manage risks. Postfix is definitely engineered
to minimize security risks.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Simplicity and
compatibility.</b></span> Postfix has been written in such a way
that setting it up &ldquo;from scratch&rdquo; can take as little as five
minutes. When you want to replace sendmail or other MTAs, it's even
better: postfix by default can use the old configuration
files!</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robustness and
stability.</b></span> Postfix was written with the expectation that
certain components of the mail network (the Local Area Network, the
Internet uplink, the local interfaces, etc.) will occasionally
fail. By anticipating things that can go wrong at either end of any
given transaction, postfix is capable of keeping the server up and
running in many (if not most) circumstances. If, for instance, a
message cannot be delivered, it is scheduled to be delivered later,
without immediately initiating a continuous retry.</p></li></ul></div><p>A key contributor to the stability and the speed of postfix
is the intelligent way in which it queues mail. Postfix uses four
different queues, each one of which is handled differently (see
Figure 1):
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4241f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Postfix Queues</p></div></div>
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Maildrop queue</b></span>.
Mail that is delivered locally on the system is accepted in the
Maildrop queue. Here, the mail is checked for proper formatting
(and fixed if necessary) before being handed to the Incoming
queue.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Incoming queue</b></span>.
The Incoming queue receives mail from other hosts, clients or the
Maildrop queue. As long as e-mail is still arriving and as long as
postfix hasn't really handled the e-mail, this queue is the place
where the e-mails are kept.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Active queue</b></span>. The
Active queue is the queue that is used to actually deliver messages
and therefore has the greatest potential risk of something going
wrong. This queue has a limited size, and messages will be accepted
only if there is space for them. That means e-mail in the Incoming
and Deferred queues have to wait until the Active queue can accept
them.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Deferred queue</b></span>.
E-mail that cannot be delivered is placed in the Deferred queue.
This prevents the system from continuously trying to deliver e-mail
and keeps the Active queue as short as possible in order to give
newer messages priority. This also enhances stability. If the MTA
cannot reach a domain, <span   class="bold"><b>all</b></span> the
e-mail for that domain is placed in the Deferred queue, so that
those messages will not needlessly monopolize system resources.
Retry is scheduled with an increasing waiting time. When the
waiting time expires, the e-mail is again placed in the Active
queue for delivery; the system keeps track of retry history.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdab6a8"></a>Postfix for the Lazy: A Quick and Dirty Startup
Procedure</h2></div></div><p>And now the part you've been waiting for (or have skipped
directly to): postfix setup. Like sendmail, postfix uses a &ldquo;.cf&rdquo;
text file as its primary configuration file called
<b  >main.cf</b>. However, &ldquo;.cf&rdquo; files in postfix use a
simple &ldquo;parameter=$value&rdquo; syntax. What's more, these files are
extremely well commented and use highly descriptive variable
names.</p><p>In fact, if your e-mail needs are simple enough, it's
probably possible for you to figure out much of what you need to
know by editing <b  >main.cf</b> and reading its comments
as you go.</p><p>For many users, this is all one needs to do to configure
postfix on an SMTP gateway:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Install postfix from a binary package via your
local package tool (rpm, etc.) or by compiling from source and
running postfix's <b  >INSTALL.sh</b> script.</p></li><li><p>Open /etc/postfix/main.cf with the text editor of
your choice.</p></li><li><p>Uncomment and set the parameter
<b  >myhostname</b> to equal your server's fully
qualified domain name (FQDN), e.g., &ldquo;<b  >myhostname =
buford.dogpeople.org</b>&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Uncomment and set the parameter
<b  >mydestination</b> as follows, assuming this is the
e-mail gateway for one's entire domain:</p></li></ol></div><pre     class="programlisting">
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, $mydomain
</pre><p>NOTE: Enter the above line verbatim.
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Save and close main.cf.</p></li><li><p>If desired, add a line to /etc/aliases diverting
root's mail to a less-privileged account, e.g., <b  >root:
mick</b>. This is also the place to map aliases for users who
are served by internal mail servers (for example,
<b  >mick.bauer: mbauer@secretserver.dogpeople.org</b>).
When you are done editing and/or adding aliases, save the file and
enter the command <b  >newaliases</b> to convert it into
a hash database.</p></li><li><p>Execute the command <b  >postfix
start</b>.</p></li></ol></div>

What did we just achieve? In only four steps, we installed,
configured and started SMTP services for our machine and its local
name-domain. If this machine is a firewall or an SMTP gateway on a
firewall's DMZ network, it can now be used by local users to route
outbound e-mail, and can be pointed to by our domain's &ldquo;MX&rdquo; DNS
record (i.e., it can be advertised to the outside world as a mail
server for e-mail addressed to our domain). We've also told it to
directly process (rather than forward) mail addressed to local
hosts. Pretty good return on the investment of about five minutes'
worth of typing, no?
</p><p>(NOTE: While this may be enough to get postfix working, it is
<span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> enough to secure it. Don't
stop reading yet!)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdac2b0"></a>The Quickness and Dirtiness Explained</h2></div></div><p>As cool as that was, it may not have been enough to get
postfix to do what needs to be done for your network. And even if
it was, it behooves you to dig a little deeper: ignorance nearly
always leads to bad security. Let's take a closer look at what we
just did, and then move on to even niftier postfix tricks.</p><p>First, why did so little information need to be entered in
main.cf? The only thing we added to it was our fully qualified
domain name. In fact, depending on how your machine is configured,
it may not have even been necessary to supply
<span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span>!</p><p>This is because postfix uses system calls such as
<b  >gethostname</b> to glean as much information as
possible directly from your kernel. If given the fully qualified
domain name of your host, it's smart enough to know that everything
past the first &ldquo;.&rdquo; is your name-domain, and it sets the variable
<b  >mydomain</b> accordingly.</p><p>You may need to add additional names to
<b  >mydestination</b> if your server has more than one
FQDN (that is, multiple &ldquo;A&rdquo; records in your domain's DNS). For
example, if your SMTP gateway doubles as your public FTP server,
and thus has the name &ldquo;ftp&rdquo; associated with it in addition to its
normal host name, your <b  >mydestination</b> declaration
might look something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, ftp://www.$mydomain, $mydomain
</pre><p>It's important that <span   class="bold"><b>any name</b></span>
by which your server can be legitimately referred to is contained
in this line.
</p><p>There were two other interesting things we did in the &ldquo;quick
and dirty&rdquo; procedure. One was to start postfix with the command
<b  >postfix start</b>. Just as BIND uses
<b  >ndc</b> to control the various processes that
comprise BIND, the <b  >postfix</b> command can be used
to manage postfix. Like BIND, postfix is actually a suite of
commands, d&aelig;mons and scripts rather than a single
monolithic program.</p><p>The most common invocations of the <b  >postfix</b>
command are <b  >postfix start, postfix stop</b> and
<b  >postfix reload</b>. Start and stop are obvious;
reload causes postfix to reload its configuration files without
stopping and restarting. Another handy one is <b  >postfix
flush</b>, which forces postfix to immediately attempt to
send all queued messages. This is particularly useful after
changing a setting that you think may have been causing
problems&mdash;in the event that your change worked, all messages
delayed by the problem go out immediately. They'd go out
regardless, but not as quickly.</p><p>The other thing we did was to add a line to /etc/aliases to
divert root's e-mail to an unprivileged account. This is good
healthy paranoia: we don't want to have to log in as the superuser
for mundane activities such as viewing system reports, which are
sometimes e-mailed to root. Be careful, however: if your
unprivileged account uses a &ldquo;.forward&rdquo; file to forward your mail
to some other system, you may wind up sending administrative
messages over public bandwidth in clear text!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdacaf0"></a>Aliases Revealed</h2></div></div><p>As alluded to in the quick and dirty procedure, aliases are
also useful for mapping e-mail addresses for users who don't
actually have accounts on the SMTP gateway. This practice has two
main benefits. First, most users prefer meaningful e-mail names and
short host /domain names, e.g., &ldquo;john.smith@acme.com&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;jsmith023@mail77.midwest.acme.com&rdquo;. Second, you probably don't
want your users connecting to and storing mail on a publicly
accessible server. Again, common sense tells us that any server the
unwashed masses can commune with must be kept at arm's length. The
greater the separation between public servers and private servers,
the better. (And don't forget, POPmail passwords are transmitted in
clear text!)</p><p>Still another use of <b  >aliases</b> is the
maintenance of mailing lists. An alias can point to not only an
address or comma-separated list of addresses, but also to a mailing
list. This is achieved with the
<b  >:include:</b>tag&mdash;without this, postfix will
<span   class="bold"><b>append</b></span> mail to the file specified
rather than using the file to obtain recipients. (This is a
feature, not a bug; it's useful sometimes to write certain types of
messages to a text file rather than to a mailbox.)</p><p>Here's part of an example alias file that contains all of
these types of mappings:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
postmaster:     root
mailer-daemon:  root
hostmaster:     root
root:           bdewinter
mailguys:       bdewinter,mick.bauer
mick.bauer:     mbauer@biscuit.stpaul.dogpeople.org
clients:        :include:/etc/postfix/clientlist.txt
spam-reports:   /home/bdewinter/spambucket.txt
</pre><p>One warning: if an alias points to a different mail server,
that server must belong to a domain for which the SMTP gateway is
configured to relay mail (i.e., either that server's FQDN or its
domain must be listed in the <b  >mydestination</b>
declaration in main.cf).
</p><p>Don't forget to run either <b  >newaliases</b> or,
hipper still, <b  >postalias /etc/aliases</b> anytime you
edit aliases. The <b  >postalias</b> command is hipper
because it can accept <span   class="bold"><b>any</b></span>
correctly formatted alias file as its input. Both commands compress
the alias file into a database file that can be searched repeatedly
and rapidly each time a destination address is parsed; neither
postfix nor sendmail directly use the text version of
<b  >aliases</b>.</p><p>If you have a large number of users and/or internal mail
servers, alias-file updates lend themselves to automation,
especially via Secure Shell (ssh) and Secure Copy (scp). Using scp
with null-passphrase RSA (or DSS/El Gamal) keys, your internal mail
servers can periodically copy their local alias files to the SMTP
gateway, which can then merge them into a new /etc/aliases followed
by <b  >postalias /etc/aliases</b>. (Unfortunately,
telling you exactly <span   class="bold"><b>how</b></span> to use
scp/ssh is beyond the scope of this article.) This practice is
especially useful in large organizations where different people
control different mail servers: day-to-day e-mail account
administration can be kept decentralized.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0xdad1d0"></a>Keeping out Unsolicited Commercial
E-mail</h2></div></div><p>Junk mail is one of the most common and annoying types of
e-mail abuse. Postfix offers protection against UCE (Unsolicited
Commercial E-mail) via a couple of settings in main.cf. Some
caution is in order, however: there's a fine line between spam and
legitimate dissemination, and it's entirely possible that even
modest UCE controls will cause some legitimate (i.e., desired) mail
to be dropped.</p><p>Having said that, for most sites this is an acceptable risk
(avoidable, too, through end-user education), and we recommend that
at a <span   class="emphasis"><em>minimum</em></span>, you set the following in
main.cf:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>smtpd_recipient_limit</b></span>.
This setting indicates how many recipients may be addressed in the
header of a single message. Normally, such a number should not
exceed something like 500. It would be extreme to receive an e-mail
that has 500 recipients and was not being sent to a mailing
list.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>smtpd_recipient_restricitons</b></span>.
Not every e-mail that arrives at your server should be accepted.
This parameter instructs postfix to check each message's
recipient-address base on one or more criteria. One of the easiest
to maintain is the <b  >access</b> database. This file
lists domains, hosts, networks and users who are allowed to receive
mail from your server. To enable it: (1) set
<b  >check_recipient_access = hash:access</b>; (2) create
/etc/postfix/access (do a <b  >man 5 access</b> for
format/syntax); and (3) run <b  >postmap
hash:/etc/postfix/access</b> to convert the file into a
database. Repeat step (3) each time you edit
/etc/postfix/access.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>smtpd_sender_restrictions</b></span>.
By default postfix will accept SMTP connections from everybody,
potentially exposing your server to SMTP relaying, a method often
used for UCE perpetrators who wish to hide their identities by
&ldquo;bouncing&rdquo; their messages off unsuspecting SMTP relayers. If this
occurs, it's possible and even likely that other servers will
reject e-mail from your domain(s). Other protection mechanisms lie
in the fact that it is always wise to check the sender against DNS.
Although this costs some performance, it makes it harder to send
the information from a faulty sender e-mail address. See the file
/etc/postfix/sample-smtpd.cf for a list of possible list options
for this parameter. Note that <b  >hash:access</b> is one
of them; the <b  >access</b> database can be used not
only to allow/disallow particular recipients, but senders as well.
For a complete list of anti-UCE parameters and their exact syntax
see /etc/postfix/sample-smtpd.cf.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x10bfbd8"></a>Hiding Internal E-mail Addresses by
Masquerading</h2></div></div><p>In order to prevent giving out information that serves no
purpose to legitimate external parties, it is wise to set in the
main.cf file the parameter
<b  >masquerade_domains =
$mydomain</b> (remember,
&ldquo;<b  >$mydomain</b>&rdquo; refers to a variable). If you wish
to make an exception for mail sent by &ldquo;root&rdquo; (probably a good
idea), you can set the parameter
<b  >masquerade_exceptions =
root</b>. This will cause internal host names to
be stripped from FQDSes in &ldquo;From&rdquo; addresses of outbound
messages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x10bfde8"></a>Running Postfix in a chroot Jail</h2></div></div><p>Now we come to one of the groovier things we can do to secure
postfix: running it in a &ldquo;chroot jail&rdquo;.
<span   class="bold"><b>chroot</b></span> is a UNIX command that
confines the &ldquo;chrooted&rdquo; process to a specified directory; that
directory becomes &ldquo;/&rdquo; for that process. This usually requires you
to first create copies of things needed by the process but normally
kept elsewhere. For example, if the process looks for
&ldquo;/etc/mydaemon.conf&rdquo; upon startup but is being chrooted to
&ldquo;/var/mydaemon&rdquo;, the process will actually look for
&ldquo;/var/mydaemon/etc/mydaemon.conf&rdquo;.</p><p>The advantage to chrooting should be obvious: should a
chrooted-postfix process become hijacked somehow, the attacker will
find himself in a &ldquo;padded cell&rdquo; from which (hopefully) no
sensitive or important system files or data can be accessed. This
isn't a panacea, but it significantly. increases the difficulty of
exploiting postfix.</p><p>Happily, the preparations required to chroot postfix are
provided in a subdirectory of the postfix documentation called
&ldquo;examples&rdquo;. These files aren't really shell scripts: they're
suggested sequences of commands.</p><p>Better still, some binary distributions of postfix have
installation scripts that automatically make these preparations for
you after installing postfix. In SuSE, for example, the postfix RPM
package runs a script that creates a complete directory tree for
postfix to use when chrooted (etc, usr, lib, and so forth) in
/var/spool/postfix, with the appropriate ownerships and
permissions.</p><p>In addition to &ldquo;provisioning&rdquo; postfix's chroot jail, you
need to edit /etc/postfix/master.cf to toggle the postfix

<span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span>, however, do this for
d&aelig;mons whose &ldquo;command&rdquo; column indicates that they are of
type &ldquo;pipe&rdquo; or &ldquo;local&rdquo;. Some binary-package distributions
toggle the appropriate d&aelig;mons to chroot automatically during
postfix installation (again, SuSE does).</p><p>After configuring the chroot jail and editing master.cf, all
you need to do is start postfix the way you normally would:

the actual chroot-ing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbb580.0x10c01b0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>That's more than enough information to get you started. May
