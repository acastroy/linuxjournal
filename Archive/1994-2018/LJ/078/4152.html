    With graphics capabilities being so important and new cards
    appearing all the time, you need a score card to pick the
    right one. Here it is...
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fd608"></a></h2></div></div><p>The winter of 1999 was a turning point
for 3-D games on Linux. Two of the highest profile first-person
shooters, Epic's Unreal Tournament and id Software's Quake III
Arena, were released nearly simultaneously for Windows and Linux.
As little as a year earlier, the state of 3-D graphics acceleration
on Linux would have prevented the platform from reaching such
parity with the Windows world. Now, nearly all major video card
makers are working to ensure that their cards provide some level of
3-D graphics support on Linux. With that hardware support, Linux
gamers are presented with a choice hitherto unheard of: picking the
perfect 3-D video card from over a dozen choices.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fd710"></a>The Players</h2></div></div><p>In the beginning, Linux users had only one choice in hardware
acceleration: 3dfx. Through the work of Daryll Strauss, the line of
Voodoo cards have been well supported for quite a while, providing
both Glide and OpenGL (via Mesa) acceleration. Currently, 3dfx has
contracted Precision Insight to complete XFree86 4.0 drivers that
use their Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI) for 3-D hardware
acceleration.</p><p>With the release of hardware specifications for their G200
and G400 cards, Matrox has recently shown strong support for the
Linux sector. Not only are their cards well supported for 2-D
acceleration, but the work of the Utah-GLX team has provided robust
3-D acceleration of OpenGL (again via Mesa) in XFree86 3.3.x. For
the new XFree86 4.0, Precision Insight has been contracted to
maintain 3-D acceleration for the Matrox G400 via the DRI.</p><p>ATI, the biggest supplier of graphics cards worldwide, has
also shown support for Linux recently. Besides assisting the
Utah-GLX project to support the 3-D portion of the older Rage Pro
cards, they are also relying on Precision Insight to provide
acceleration for their Rage 128/Rage 128 Pro cards in XFree86 4.0
via the DRI. Further, ATI has promised Linux drivers for boards
based on their brand new Radeon chip.</p><p>Finally, NVIDIA has made a big splash in recent months with
their release of XFree86 4.0 drivers supporting a wide array of
cards, from the TNT all the way up to the newest GeForce 2. Their
OpenGL support and speed, all developed in-house, is unrivaled in
the Linux world and is currently setting the standard for speed and
OpenGL conformance.</p><p>Together, these companies provide a selection of about a
dozen cards that support 3-D acceleration in Linux. We'll take a
quick look at each card and point out its strengths and
weaknesses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fd978"></a>The Cards, Company by Company</h2></div></div><p>Now, let us take a look at some of the most popular 3-D cards
supported under Linux. We've grouped them by manufacturer so that
we can make general comments about the company and their
hardware.</p><p>3dfx</p><p>The 3dfx line of cards starts with the low-end Voodoo1 and
stretches up to the very newest Voodoo4 and Voodoo5 cards. Along
the way, you can see the evolution from the limited add-on 3-D-only
cards like the Voodoo Graphics and Voodoo2 cards to the
fully-featured 2-D/3-D of the Voodoo5.</p><p>All 3dfx cards natively support a 3-D graphics API, developed
by 3dfx, called Glide. Glide is used in a handful of Linux games
like Loki's Myth II and Epic's Unreal Tournament. For such games,
3dfx cards are often the best (and sometimes the only) choice for
hardware acceleration. Unfortunately, most 3dfx cards also lack
crucial features that some gamers want, like full support for
32-bit color and a stencil buffer. The newest Voodoo4 and Voodoo5
cards have finally added these features, as well as others.</p><p>Finally, for OpenGL support, the 3dfx drivers depend on Mesa,
an open-source implementation of the OpenGL API. This means that
the OpenGL performance and conformance of the 3dfx cards is
dependent to a great degree upon the development of Mesa.</p><p>Voodoo Graphics (a.k.a. Voodoo1)</p><p>Price: Around $30 or less used (not available in retail any
longer)</p><p>Benefits: The relatively low price and native support for
Glide are the primary advantages of the Voodoo Graphics
board.</p><p>Disadvantages: The Voodoo Graphics board is not an all-in-one
graphics board; it provides only 3-D acceleration while letting
your main 2-D board take care of normal operation. Further, it
provides acceleration up to a resolution of only 640x480 due to
limited RAM.</p><p>Voodoo2 and Voodoo2 SLI</p><p>Price: Around $80 for a new Voodoo2-1000 from 3dfx</p><p>Benefits: Still a reasonable budget accelerator, the
Voodoo2's real power comes when working in pairs to provide Scan
Line Interleave (SLI) functionality. In this configuration, each
card renders half of the scan lines on the screen, increasing
performance and the maximum resolution possible in 3-D from 800x600
for a single card to 1024x768. Glide support is also a
bonus.</p><p>Disadvantages: Like the Voodoo Graphics, the Voodoo2 is an
add-on card to supplement your 2-D card. That means that for SLI
you could be using as many as 3 PCI card slots just for video
cards. Coupled with the relatively high price and aging technology,
even the Voodoo2 SLI setup looks less than appealing.</p><p>Banshee</p><p>Price: Around $70</p><p>Benefits: The Banshee is a 2-D and 3-D card in one, making it
a step better than the Voodoo2 and Voodoo Graphics cards. The low
price and the native Glide support make the Banshee a reasonable,
cheap, low-end card.</p><p>Disadvantages: The Banshee, while clocked higher than the
Voodoo2, has only one texture processor. So it is faster than a
single Voodoo2 in some games, but can be slower in those that
require multi-texturing (which means just about every newer
game).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4152f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Voodoo3-3000
</p></div></div><p>Voodoo3-2000, 3000, 3500TV</p><p>Price: From $90 for the Voodoo3-2000 to $200 for the
Voodoo3-3500TV</p><p>Benefits: The Voodoo3 provides more 3-D power than the
Voodoo2 SLI along with a 2-D core similar to the Banshee for a
reasonable price. Additionally, with several models and PCI
options, there is a card to fit almost every need and budget.
Further, the 3500TV has a TV tuner that is supported under
Linux.</p><p>Disadvantages: For the best performance, you'll need to get a
3500TV and that is a bit pricey. Further, the lack of modern
features that the Voodoo4/5 and competition offer is
disappointing.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4152f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Voodoo5-5500
</p></div></div><p>Voodoo4 and Voodoo5</p><p>Price: From $179 for the low-end Voodoo4 to $600 for the
Voodoo5-6000</p><p>Benefits: All the advantages of the Voodoo3 with more 3-D
performance and features like 32-bit color, large texture support,
and stencil buffers. Based on a scalable architecture around the
VSA-100 chip, 3dfx is again offering a range of cards, in both PCI
and AGP, to appeal to all customers. 3dfx is also pushing the
ability to do full-scene anti-aliasing (FSAA) with hardware support
in the V4/5 cards. This would improve the visual quality of all
games (OpenGL and Glide) without the performance hit normally
associated with FSAA.</p><p>Disadvantages: The price for FSAA is tremendous amounts of
RAM, like the 64MB on the Voodoo5-5500, and that may cost a pretty
penny. The best V5 card, the Voodoo5-6000, will probably be out of
the reach of most gamers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fe630"></a>Matrox</h2></div></div><p>Normally known for their high-quality 2-D core, the latest
Matrox cards, like the G400Max, are also powerful 3-D performers.
Now that they are releasing the hardware specification and working
with the Utah-GLX team and Precision Insight, those 3-D benefits
can be seen in Linux as well. Like the 3dfx and ATI, Matrox cards
depend on the Mesa implementation of OpenGL.</p><p>G200</p><p>Price: $50 or less</p><p>Benefits: Relatively speaking, the G200 is a cheap card that
can provide reasonable hardware acceleration and sharp 2-D. Despite
being a lower-end card, it does support 32-bit color in 3-D if you
absolutely want it.</p><p>Disadvantages: Like its price reflects, the G200 is a low-end
card. Don't expect to play Quake III Arena in all its glory at
anything close to an acceptable frame rate.</p><p>G400</p><p>Price: $100 for a G400 single-head to $200 for a G400Max
dual-head</p><p>Benefits: The G400Max is quite fast with the Utah-GLX
drivers, and in a dual-head configuration can drive two monitors at
once. Fortunately, the G400 comes in several models to suit
different needs and budgets. Further, the G400 supports modern 3-D
features like 32-bit output and large textures and can maintain a
solid frame rate while doing so. Add in the clean 2-D, and the G400
cards look appealing.</p><p>Disadvantages: To get the best performance, expect to lay out
some cash for the G400Max. It would also be nice if Matrox helped
support bump-mapping in Linux like it does in Windows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15fe9f8"></a>ATI</h2></div></div><p>Like Matrox and 3dfx, ATI is helping the Linux community by
working with developers to create and maintain their drivers.
Further, they are looking into more than just 3-D by trying to add
2-D video acceleration (as might be used with DVD players) to their
Linux support. ATI also has their Radeon chip on the horizon, with
its plethora of new features and promised speed and Linux drivers.
Their support with the Rage Pro and Rage 128 could be just the
precursor to the splash that ATI could make in the Linux
world.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4152f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. ATI-RagePro
</p></div></div><p>Rage Pro</p><p>Price: $35</p><p>Benefits: Now a very old card, the Rage Pro can be had very
inexpensively. The support with the Utah-GLX drivers is as fast, if
not faster, than the drivers for Windows.</p><p>Disadvantages: The Rage Pro just can't keep up with the rest
of the pack. Quake III Arena is playable only after all the special
effects are turned off. This should be considered the very low-end
for any hardware acceleration in Linux.</p><p>Rage 128, Rage 128 Pro</p><p>Price: $60 for the Rage 128 to $130 for the Rage 128
Pro</p><p>Benefits: The Rage 128 line of cards are now supported under
XFree86 4.0 and take advantage of the DRI for hardware acceleration
and should perform quite well for the price.</p><p>Disadvantages: The drivers are still in development and
aren't as fast or as optimized as those offered by other
cards.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15f5808"></a>NVIDIA</h2></div></div><p>Somewhat of a late bloomer relative to the others, NVIDIA
finally made their presence felt in Spring 2000 when they released
their XFree86 4.0 drivers. Based on the same code as their Windows
implementation, the drivers offer the fastest and most conformant
OpenGL acceleration available in Linux. Further, NVIDIA supports a
wide range of cards, from their venerable TNT all the way up to
their latest GeForce 2 cards. This range of cards supports many
features, like 32-bit color and stencil buffers.</p><p>One special feature available on the GeForce and GeForce 2
cards is the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This GPU offloads some
of the computationally expensive work (mainly coordinate
transformations and lighting operations) normally done by the CPU,
leading in some cases to improved performance on lower-end systems.
Additionally, NVIDIA is pushing support for all features currently
available in Windows, including AGP transfers, texture compression,
and flat-panel output as well as others. They also promise to offer
in Linux the same full-scene anti-aliasing that has recently
arrived as part of their Windows drivers.</p><p>One other advantage that NVIDIA has over 3dfx, Matrox and ATI
is their business model. Currently they just make chips and other
companies make the boards. The competition among the board makers
can then lead to better prices for consumers.</p><p>TNT</p><p>Price: $30 used (not available in retail)</p><p>Benefits: A cheap, older card, the TNT offers solid OpenGL
acceleration and 32-bit color.</p><p>Disadvantages: As the price might suggest, this card looks
slow in today's market and doesn't have as much memory as newer
cards. It is becoming a low-end card.</p><p>TNT2 and TNT2 Ultra</p><p>Price: $40 for a smaller TNT2 up to $140 for a TNT2
Ultra</p><p>Benefits: A range of cards to choose from, with varying
speeds, a gamer on a budget can find a TNT2 to suit his needs. The
TNT2 Ultra is still a reasonably speedy card and with its full set
of features, solid OpenGL support, and 32MB of RAM, will last a bit
longer for playing the newest games at a passable frame
rate.</p><p>Disadvantages: The price for the high-end TNT2 Ultra can seem
a big pricey for its power with today's games. And some features
can be used only at a sizeable performance hit (like 32-bit
color).</p><p>GeForce SDR and DDR</p><p>Price: $130 for the GeForce 32MB SDR up to $290 for the
GeForce 32MB DDR</p><p>Benefits: The NVIDIA GPU can help boost the performance on a
system with an older CPU. Further, the support for texture
compression, 32-bit color, and many other features makes the card a
versatile OpenGL accelerator.</p><p>Disadvantages: Unfortunately, even with DDR RAM the GeForce
is bandwidth limited on high-end systems. Currently, the benefits
seen from using the GPU are limited to just a few games. And expect
to pay well over $200 for the best card.</p><p>GeForce 2 GTS</p><p>Price: Over $300</p><p>Benefits: The fastest card currently available on the market,
and with the GPU it should last even the demanding gamer for a good
long time. This is the card to have for today's hard-core Linux
gamer. And with several companies making boards, there should be
competition to bring prices down. This is also the NVIDIA card with
enough bandwidth to support FSAA when NVIDIA adds that feature to
their Linux drivers. This is the most future-proof card you can
buy.</p><p>Disadvantages: For the fastest card on the market, expect to
pay dearly; the GeForce 2 can cost as much as the CPU in your
system. Also, there still seem to be some bandwidth issues,
especially on higher-end systems at high resolutions. Finally,
support for the features of the GPU haven't yet been fully realized
in today's games.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1505580.0x15f5f40"></a>How to Choose?</h2></div></div><p>Now that you can see all the cards available, here are few
questions that may help you choose the card that best fits your
needs.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Is fast, accurate OpenGL performance important to
you? Do you demand the best Quake III Arena performance?</p></li></ul></div><p>If you require the best OpenGL acceleration under Linux, look
to NVIDIA for your card. They have a great OpenGL implementation
and can offer you fast hardware as well. That carries over to Quake
III Arena, where OpenGL performance is critical.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Do you play Unreal Tournament or other games that
require Glide?</p></li></ul></div>

Currently, Unreal Tournament plays best in Linux using Glide. That
means you need 3dfx hardware, and for best performance, a Voodoo3
or better. While it is possible that the OpenGL renderer in UT will
catch up to Glide, it's by no means a certainty.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Do you want to run two monitors at once without
sacrificing a card slot for the extra video card?</p></li></ul></div>

The Matrox G400 dual-head cards offer reasonable OpenGL
acceleration through Mesa and the ability to drive two monitors.
Other companies allow you to run several cards at once in your
system, but Matrox's solution is more elegant.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Is your budget limited and you need a 2-D/3-D card
with reasonable performance?</p></li></ul></div>

The ATI Rage 128 cards are a good balance of features and price,
while the NVIDIA TNT2 comes in a close second.
</p><p>The best way to find out what you like, naturally, is to see
the products in person. So while you can't buy each card to try it
out, a next best choice is to ask around your local LUG and find a
user with a card you are considering. Ask what they like about it
and perhaps even ask to see their system up close; in doing so,
you'll not only get an idea of what value you see in the hardware,
but also what an owner has come to think about it as well.</p></div></div>
