14th, as a handful of the world's most powerful electronics
manufacturers including Fujitsu, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, NEC and
Toshiba joined nineteen other companies and academic institutions
to launch a Japanese embedded Linux consortium. The mission of the
new Japan Embedded Linux Consortium (EMBLIX) strongly echoes that
of the Embedded Linux Consortium (ELC) formed in Chicago earlier
this year: to promote the use of Linux in a broad spectrum of
next-generation intelligent devices and embedded systems. This
strong showing of support from Japan's consumer electronics giants
adds momentum to the already rapid proliferation of embedded
Linux.</p><p>The founding members of EMBLIX include Advanced Data
Controls, Access, Canon, CATS, Centura Embedded Systems, Densan,
ERG, Elmic Systems, FDS Embedded Systems, Fujitsu, Gaio Technology,
Hitachi, Lineo Japan, Metrowerks, Mitsubishi Electric, Montavista
Software Japan, NEC Electronic Devices, Red Hat, Toshiba, Toyohashi
University of Science &amp; Technology, TurboLinux Japan, Waseda
University and YDC. Dr. Tatsuo Nakajima (Waseda University) was
named interim chair, while John Cheuck (TurboLinux Japan) and Y.
Paul Kunimine (Gaio Technology) are serving as interim vice
chairmen. First-year membership in EMBLIX costs $1,000 per company
and is waived for academic institutions. According to Cheuck,
EMBLIX membership is restricted to corporations having a
permanently established presence in Japan.</p><p>Visit EMBLIX at

companies within three months of the group's March 1 launch. In
June, the ELC elected its first Board of Directors: Dr. Inder
Singh, chairman and CEO, LynuxWorks; Michael Tiemann, chief
technology officer, Red Hat; James Ready, CEO, MontaVista Software;
Tim Bird, chief technology officer, Lineo; Dan Bandera, business
line manager, IBM Pervasive Computing; and Greg Wright, an
independent Linux community member. Wright represents the 20+
&ldquo;noncorporate&rdquo; ELC members on the board.</p><p>Congratulations are also in order for Ralf Doewich, who won
the ELC's logo contest. Doewich, whose entry placed first among a
field of fifty, was the happy recipient of an HP C500 digital

RULES</h2></div></div><p>In spite of Microsoft's advantage in marketing dollars,
Apache continues to be the web server of choice. The issue came up
again because Microsoft is attempting to migrate their hotmail.com
site over to Windows 2000 boxes.</p><p>When Microsoft bought hotmail.com and linkexchange.com, they
bought working sites based on FreeBSD. There were rumors of an
earlier conversion attempt for hotmail.com, but apparently those
were just rumors. Now it is happening.</p><p>The current report from Netcraft's web survey
(<a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey" target="_self">www.netcraft.com/survey</a>)
Apache's market share and a decrease in Microsoft's market share.
Thus, Microsoft seems to be going against the trend with
<a href="http://www.hotmail.com" target="_self">http://www.hotmail.com/</a>.</p><p>Here are some details from the survey:</p><p>Server | June 2000 | July 2000 | % ChangeApache | 10,704,306
| 11,412,233 | +0.28Microsoft ISS | 3,485,995 | 3,608,415 |
-0.50Netscape-Enterprise | 1,154,558 | 1,225,085 | +0.17</p><p>Looking at longer-term trends, it was back in 1996 when
Apache started getting significant market share and passed NCSA for
the top slot. Over the years, Apache has experienced steady growth.
Microsoft-IIS grew in market share up until the beginning of this
year, but now continues to fall.</p><p>Why is this the case? We talked to one ISP in Canada and
found that they run Apache on Linux, claiming to have about the
same amount of traffic on their single machine as the ISP a block
away has on their array of nine NT servers. Enough said.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1454580.0x154d0b0"></a>MACS AND LINUX</h2></div></div><p>Two months ago, our cover featured an iMac running Yellow Dog
Linux. Next, I saw an iMac running SuSE 6.4. in the SuSE booth at
the O'Reilly conference. What's happening?</p><p>Linux on the Mac isn't new. There has been Linux development
for M68000 and PPC-based systems for many years. What has changed
is both on the Mac and the Linux end.</p><p>First, the iMac has become a reasonably inexpensive platform
with enough documentation on the architecture to make it a place to
host your favorite OS. Today, for around $1000, you can buy a cute
little plastic box the size of a monitor that has enough computing
horsepower to run Linux. So, why not give it a try?</p><p>On the Linux side, what you get today is more appealing to
the person who owns a Mac or might want to own a Mac. Two big
issues are ease of installation and having a GUI-based system. In
the August <i  >LJ</i> review, installing Yellow Dog
was covered. Clearly an easy install. While we haven't had a chance
to install the SuSE version yet (the CD is on the way), if SuSE's
recent install on Intel-based systems is any indication, it is
going to be easy, perhaps very easy.</p><p>But, what about when the Mac user sees Linux come up? Will he
be scared? Not likely. Yellow Dog defaults to the GNOME GUI, SuSE
to KDE. Either is a reasonable desktop that shouldn't scare off the
newcomer.</p><p>Finally, Mac on Linux (MOL), included with both
distributions, allows you to access files and run native MacOS
applications under Linux. So, if beige isn't the color you want for
your Linux system, it looks like the time for colorful alternatives
is here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1454580.0x154d3c8"></a>PARTY WITH <i  >Linux Journal</i>!</h2></div></div><p>A Friday the 13th party like you've never seen

harder to install than other distributions. Rather than being
user-friendly, this distribution tries to be
&ldquo;administrator-friendly&rdquo;; that is, something an experienced UNIX
sys admin would like. Its motto is minimalism: &ldquo;All you ever
wanted in a distribution&mdash;and less!&rdquo; This distribution tries to
get out of the way as much as possible, exposing you to the raw
Linux system behind it.</p><p>Of all the major distributions, Rock Linux most closely
resembles Slackware. Rather than using a custom packaging format
like .rpm or .deb, Rock uses ordinary tarballs as its packaging
format. (*.tar.bz2, to be exact. The new .bz2 is a younger cousin
of the ubiquitous .gz format. Its practical advantage is that bzip2
produces files approximately 20% smaller than gzip.) Like
Slackware, Rock Linux prefers to patch upstream programs as little
as possible. &ldquo;If it's good enough for the upstream author, it's
good enough for us!&rdquo; Any desired customizations are the local sys
admin's responsibility.</p><p>This is in sharp contrast to most distributions, which
usually make many changes to the programs they include. They do
this both in an attempt to &ldquo;social engineer&rdquo; the distribution to
hide the operating system's complexities from the user, and to
differentiate themselves from other distributions in the
marketplace. Unfortunately, this social engineering comes at a
price: inflexibility. Those snazzy GUI configuration dialogs may be
nifty and easy to use, but if you need to change an option in a way
the GUI designers didn't envision, you're out of luck. If you do
try to outsmart the GUI tool and modify a text configuration file
by hand, you may find that the GUI tool will happily overwrite your
changes the next time somebody runs it.</p><p>Rock Linux has no GUI administration tools. However, there
are a few command-line utilities provided to make the
administrator's job easier. One is
<span   class="bold"><b>runlvedit</b></span>, which helps you edit
your system's run levels. (A run level specifies which
d&lt;\#230&gt;mons should be running in a particular situation.
Thus, run level 2 might be your &ldquo;normal&rdquo; mode, run level 3 is
without X, run level 4 is without the network, etc.) True to the
Rock Linux philosophy, runlvedit doesn't invoke a dialog. Instead,
it uses your favorite text editor as its user interface.</p><p>Rock Linux is not for the faint-hearted. You have to compile
your distribution before installing it (!), and this will take
days, even if nothing goes wrong&mdash;but of course, something will.
The installation process consists less of choosing options in
dialogs, and more of using standard Linux commands&mdash;mke2fs, mount,
etc.&mdash;or changing a configuration file and then running a shell
script to do the mundane work.</p><p>If you want to try and tame this beast, plan on spending a
week or two to get familiar with it. You'll be rewarded with a more
intimate knowledge of your Linux system and how it works than
perhaps any other distribution can offer.</p><p>For more information on Rock Linux, see these URLs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>http://e-zine.nluug.nl/hold.html?cid=59

radio.&rdquo;</p><p>&mdash;Larry Josephson</p><p>My favorite moment on &ldquo;Saturday Night Live&rdquo; was Paul
Shaffer's impersonation of Don Kirshner, the helmet-haired,
hyper-tanned record executive whose own syndicated rock concert
often followed &ldquo;SNL&rdquo; on local NBC affiliates. In April 1978,
Shaffer, playing Kirshner, introduced The Blues Brothers for the
first time. &ldquo;No longer an authentic blues act&rdquo;, he said, The
Blues Brothers had become &ldquo;a viable commercial product.&rdquo;</p><p>Even then, Kirshner was an anachronism. It was already clear
that the difference between <span   class="emphasis"><em>authentic</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>commercial</em></span> was the industrial heft required to
make and move goods whose appeal was no less manufactured than the
goods themselves. Commercial music and commercial broadcasting were
two gears in the same machine: the business of stimulating and
filling appetites for large quantities of music in the smallest
possible varieties. &ldquo;Saturday Night Live&rdquo; was part of that
machine as well. What else was on TV at that hour? Or ever?</p><p>Radio was hardly any better. Even the largest cities had
fewer than a couple dozen signals that didn't fade within a few
exits of downtown. For music stations, you could usually count the
choices on one hand. Every one of those few stations tried to
attract the largest numbers of listeners with the smallest
varieties of tastes, so they could sell those numbers at top dollar
to advertisers. The result was demand as homogeneous as supply,
plus the ironic notion that the narrowest tastes comprised the
broadest markets.</p><p>Also ironic was the belief that listeners comprised markets
in any real sense. By the economics of commercial radio,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>listeners</em></span> were the product, not programming.
Stations and networks sold time to advertisers, not programming to
listeners. Music and other programming was just bait. What
listeners really wanted meant approximately nothing, which is what
they paid for the goods. After all, they were consumers, not
customers.</p><p>So can we blame them when they give music to each other at
the same price?</p><p>Well sure. That's what the record industry has been doing by
attacking Napster and wringing its hands over the &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; of
copyrighted music that occurs when one music lover shares his or
her MP3 collection with others over the Internet. They are joined
by none other than our own leadership. Eric Raymond inveighs on
behalf of artists' and record companies' right to distribute their
property as they see fit, regardless of how easy it is for
customers to share that property without anybody's consent. In a
<i  >Linux Journal</i> guest editorial, Eric writes,
&ldquo;The real point is that by 'sharing' without the artist's consent,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>you deprive him of the right to control and dispose of
his work</em></span>. The real question is this: are you going to
support the artists, or steal away the few shreds of autonomy they
might have left?&rdquo;</p><p>Let's assume we answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the first part of that
question. The next question is, &ldquo;Can we make a market where
nothing is scarce and everybody can take what they want?&rdquo;</p><p>Courtney Love points the way:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I'm looking for people to help connect me to more
fans, because I believe fans will leave a tip based on the
enjoyment and service I provide. I'm not scared of them getting a
preview. It really is going to be a global village where a billion
people have access to one artist and a billion people can leave a
tip if they want to.
</p><p>It's a radical democratization. Every artist has access to
every fan and every fan has access to every artist, and the people
who direct fans to those artists. People that give advice and
technical value are the people we need. People crowding the
distribution pipe and trying to ignore fans and artists have no
value. This is a perfect system.</p></blockquote></div><p>Is there a tip jar system out there already&mdash;or at least the
beginnings of one?
</p><p>Indeed, there is. We call it public broadcasting. Get past
the noncommercial nature of the institutions that sell the service,
and their often pathetic appeals for &ldquo;support&rdquo;, and you see the
model at work. In some cases it works <span   class="emphasis"><em>better</em></span>
than the advertising model, for the simple and efficient reason
that the broadcaster's consumers and customers are the same
people&mdash;a market grace advertising-supported broadcasters have
never enjoyed (and paid subscription media like the one you are
reading now <span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> enjoyed, thank you very
much).</p><p>Case in point. San Francisco's KJAZ was the longest-running
commercial jazz station in the country until a few years ago, when
its owner fell into deep debt and had to unload the property, which
had been making money&mdash;not much, but enough to stay profitable. The
owner made an appeal, and listeners sent in well over a million
dollars in donations: more in a few weeks than the station made in
a year from advertising, and none of it tax-deductible. It wasn't
enough (the owner needed many more millions) and the donors got
their money back; but further proof of the market model came when
one of the local noncommercial stations picked up the format
full-time, and reportedly made <span   class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> money
selling programming to listeners than KJAZ ever did selling time to
advertisers.</p><p>I would gladly pay to play or hear anything I love. Right
now, I pay to listen to four public radio stations and one public
TV station. I don't see my purchases as &ldquo;donations&rdquo;, although I'm
glad to claim the tax deduction. I see it as a tip jar system. And
I would love to see some infrastructure built around it, so I could
automatically make micropayments (or macropayments in a few special
cases) for using artist-controlled material.</p><p>Why not set up a micropayment system for everything on TV,
making TV a completely</p></div></div>
