<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #269, September 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> has been working on some code to
support its <span   class="bold"><b>ISH</b></span> (Integrated
Sensor Hub) chips for motion detection and other localized data.
Intel's code aims to provide a similar level of Linux support as other
sensor hardware, but without changing the <span   class="bold"><b>ABI</b></span> (Application Binary
Interface), so that existing code could run on hardware containing ISH
chips, without needing to rewrite the source code.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Srinivas Pandruvada</b></span> was the Intel engineer to send out the patches and
request feedback. He offered the caveat that the code was still in an
early state, and he wanted to make sure it was heading in the right
direction.
</p><p>
Several kernel developers were happy to see these patches, though they
all reported various problems with the code and difficulty performing
tests. And while Srinivas wasn't able to produce updated patches
during the conversation, it's clear that ISH support will be in
the kernel soon.
</p><p>
Patching a running kernel without having to reboot is insanely cool.
The way it works is that the patched code and the original code coexist on
the system until nothing is using the old code. Then, the calling
paths are updated to point only to the new code. Assuming the new code
doesn't do anything fundamentally incompatible with the old, the
system should experience no trouble.
</p><p>
One problem with this is that the new code has to wait until no other
thread is running in the old code, and only then do the switch. This
could take an arbitrary amount of time, during which the kernel must
rely on the old code. <span   class="bold"><b>Josh Poimboeuf</b></span> recently submitted some changes
to the <span   class="bold"><b>live-patching code</b></span> to make the kernel switch to newly
live-patched code on a per-process basis. This way, as a given process
exited the old code, the next time it needed that code, it would see
only the new, patched version. Over time, more and more processes
would switch over to the new code, until the old code wasn't used at
all.
</p><p>
There are various insane elements to the whole issue. Live patching is
nuts. For instance, <span   class="bold"><b>Jessica Yu</b></span> pointed out that if a process was
sleeping in an uninterruptible state, it might never be able to let go
of the old code, so that code could never be removed after a
patch. And as <span   class="bold"><b>David Laight</b></span> pointed out, such a process would need
special handling by the kernel, so that the normal ways of dealing
with hung tasks wouldn't trigger anything bad with the live-patching
procedure.
</p><p>
Resource locking is crucial for a multitasking, multi-user system, but
it's difficult to get right. Locks need to be as fast as possible, or
they risk slowing down the system significantly. They also need to
lock only the specific resource they want, or they risk making other
processes wait around. That was the problem with the <span   class="bold"><b>Big Kernel Lock</b></span>
(BKL) that has since been replaced with a variety of smaller locks.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Peter Zijlstra</b></span> recently noticed that some kernel code would check a
lock too early and potentially miss important state changes. He
posted some code to fix it, but his proposed interface apparently
relied a little too heavily on the user understanding the inner
workings of those locks. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> objected very strongly,
saying, &ldquo;NAK. We don't start adding more of this 'after_ctrl_dep'
crap. It's completely impossible to understand, and even people who
have been locking experts have gotten it wrong. So it is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>completely</em></span>
unacceptable to have it in drivers. This needs to be either hidden
inside the basic spinlock functions, <span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> it needs to be a clear and
unambiguous interface.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Fortunately, as <span   class="bold"><b>Tejun Heo</b></span> pointed out, the whole question might turn
out to be moot, since the portion of code that contained Peter's
problem might not be needed anymore and simply could be removed from
the kernel. Peter replied that this would be perfectly acceptable to
him, and the thread petered out.
</p><p>
Virtualization is one of the hairiest parts of kernel development.
It's the effort to make the kernel appear to be running user code on
multiple separate systems, all the while running everything on just
one. And, since the virtual systems need to communicate their needs and
the users' needs to the real system underneath, it can be hard to give
users absolutely every privilege they expect.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Serge E. Hallyn</b></span> recently tried to address one of these sorts of
issues. If users untar a tarball, the <span   class="bold"><b>extended
attributes</b></span> (xattrs)
of the extracted files need to be preserved, according to the security
privileges of those users. And if the users are on a virtualized system,
they may have privileges on that system that appear to be greater than
the privileges they'd have on the real system underneath. For example,
regular users can be root on their personalized virtual systems, but
they're still just regular users underneath.
</p><p>
Serge sent in some patches to prevent users from giving files more
powerful xattrs than they deserved, by spoofing the real xattr with an
alternative that had lesser security privileges. However, as <span   class="bold"><b>Eric W.
Biederman</b></span> put it, creating alternative xattrs actually would have the
effect of letting otherwise identical file repositories get out of
sync with each other.
</p><p>
Eric suggested simply keeping the xattrs as stored in the tarball (or
anywhere else), but having the kernel keep track of the true security
level of the user who unpacked it. The kernel could, therefore, prevent
the user from improperly gaining any extra security privileges.
</p><p>
Serge probably will implement Eric's idea, although <span   class="bold"><b>Mimi Zohar</b></span> (and
Serge himself) particularly appreciated the sneaky way Serge's
original patch would detect the attempt to gain improper security
powers and use alternate xattrs to prevent it. But, sometimes the
simpler idea is better.

I love cruising the internet looking for amusing videos. I'm pretty
sure everyone who works at a computer finds themselves down weird
YouTube rabbit holes from time to time. Unfortunately, I never
can seem to find the videos I like the best when I'm trying to show someone
else. Thankfully, if you're on an Android device, you can save YouTube
videos locally.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12068androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12068androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Mind you, an app for ripping YouTube videos is not something you'll find
in the Google Play store. But, if you're okay with violating YouTube's terms
of service, or if your country doesn't have legal issues with downloading
a copy of YouTube videos, check out Videoder (<a href="https://www.videoder.net" target="_self">https://www.videoder.net</a>). It's a downloadable APK
installer that will allow you to save a local copy of any YouTube video
you happen across!

<h2 class="title">A Switch for Your Pi</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #269, September 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In my Open-Source Classroom column this month, I talk about an add-on
card for the Raspberry Pi called the ControlBlock. It allows game
controllers to be connected as regular joystick devices, but it also has
a really incredible power switch feature. The folks at <a href="http://blog.petrockblock.com" target="_self">blog.petrockblock.com</a>
have created an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi that strictly does
the power feature for a cheaper price!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12068blockf1.large.jpg"><img src="12068blockf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The PowerBlock is a tiny, $22 circuit board that provides a few useful
features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Power can be supplied to the Raspberry Pi via any 5V source, not just
MicroUSB. (MicroUSB still is supported though.)
</p></li><li><p>
By connecting a toggle switch, the Raspberry Pi can be turned on. When
the switch is turned off, rather than cutting the power to the Raspberry
Pi, the PowerBlock initiates the shutdown command, and then powers down the
system.
</p></li><li><p>
There are connectors for an LED (either embedded into the switch
or separately, like in the photo) that show the progress of the power
on/off process.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Basically, when switched on, the PowerBlock starts the Raspberry Pi. The
LED blinks slowly until the RPi is completely booted, then the LED stays
lit solidly. When the switch is turned to the off position, the LED blinks
rapidly while it goes through the shutdown procedure. Then after the
RPi is shut down, it powers off the device and the LED.
</p><p>
We typically give the Editors' Choice award to software, but this month,
the award goes to the PowerBlock. We love Raspberry
Pi projects so much that anything making those projects better deserves
our attention. The PowerBlock doesn't do anything the more expensive
ControlBlock doesn't already do, but if your project doesn't require
the game controller support of the ControlBlock, the PowerBlock is
perfect. For more details, head over to <a href="http://blog.petrockblock.com" target="_self">blog.petrockblock.com</a>.

I like Pandora. I like it because it doesn't require me to know anything
other than whether I like the current song. I'm sure other music
services offer more features or a larger catalog, but Pandora is
simple. So am I.
</p><p>
One of the frustrating things about using the web-based version of Pandora
is that getting back to the proper tab can be frustrating. Thanks to
an oddly named open-source tool for OS X, when I'm on a Mac, I can map
keyboard shortcuts to the web player even if it's in the background.

The BeardedSpice program is open source and available to download at
<a href="http://beardedspice.github.io" target="_self">beardedspice.github.io</a>. At first, I wasn't sure how to configure
it, but that's because there's very little to configure. Once I set
the keyboard shortcuts I wanted, it's just a matter of pressing them
while the music is playing! It's simple, effective and it's free
(both kinds of free). If you use OS X, grab a copy today!

<h2 class="title">3D CAD Modeling</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #269, September 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Linux has several options available for handling CAD (computer-assisted
drafting) projects. In this article, I cover OpenSCAD
(<a href="http://www.openscad.org" target="_self">www.openscad.org</a>), which is available on Linux, Mac
OS X and Windows.
</p><p>
Most Linux distributions should have it&mdash;for
example, you can install it on Debian-based distributions with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install openscad
</pre>
</p><p>
This will install all of the relevant binaries, along with several
example files. 
</p><p>
Many other CAD systems, such as Blender, are
focused on the graphics of the rendering in order to produce very
pretty pictures. OpenSCAD focuses more on the practical side of 3D
modeling. It also isn't designed to do interactive model construction,
but instead uses CAD specification files and then renders the final
object, almost like compiling an executable.
</p><p>
You can start OpenSCAD from a menu entry in your desktop
environment or by executing the <tt  >openscad</tt> command from a terminal
window. When it first starts, you'll see an initial window where
you can select from a list of recent files or choose from the list of
installed example files.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12068openscadf1.large.jpg"><img src="12068openscadf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you first start OpenSCAD, you'll see a listing of the most
recent projects along with a selection of examples.
</p></div></div><p>
To get started, let's
look at one of the example files&mdash;in this case, let's
look at the first one: CSG.scad. The default layout
consists of three separate panes. The main pane on the left-hand side
is the main editor where you can define all the parts of your 3D
design. The right-hand side is divided into two more panes. The top
half is where the final 3D-rendered object is displayed. The bottom
half is a console pane where messages are displayed. These messages
could include messages from the rendering section. The viewing pane
is a standard 3D viewing pane. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12068openscadf2.large.jpg"><img src="12068openscadf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The main window for OpenSCAD, where you can define the objects to
be
rendered.
</p></div></div><p>
You can click and drag the display to
rotate the view of your 3D object. There is also a set of icons at the
bottom of the viewer where you can zoom in or out, rotate or select one
of the standard views. Additionally, a set of icons at the top of the
editor window gives you access to the most common functions. Here,
you can open or save projects, as well as preview or render your object.
</p><p>
When you are ready to start a new project, you can click on the
menu item File&rarr;New or press Ctrl-N. This will pop up a new window
with an empty editor. Unlike many other CAD systems, OpenSCAD doesn't
include a toolbox of objects that you can click and drag to build up
your object. Instead, you need to type in the specifications for each
of the elements for your design. As a simple example, you could add a
cube with dimensions 2x3x4 by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cube([2, 3, 4]);
</pre>
</p><p>
You won't see anything at this point within the viewer pane. In order
to trigger a rendering, you can do a preview by clicking the menu item
Design&rarr;Preview or pressing F5. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12068openscadf3.large.jpg"><img src="12068openscadf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. As a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; example, you can draw a basic cube with a
single
command.
</p></div></div><p>
A number of
basic objects are available, such as spheres, cylinders and polygons. In
order to do things with those basic units, OpenSCAD provides a number of
transformational functions that you can apply to them. For example,
you can move an object with the translate function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
translate([5,0,0]) {
    sphere(1, center=true);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
OpenSCAD projects are based on a tree structure. So
transformational functions, like <tt  >translate</tt>, apply to the children of
the function. These children are all grouped together within curly
braces. 
</p><p>
You also can apply a number of other transformations, such as
mirroring, scaling, coloring, rotating or offsets. You can combine
multiple transformations simply by adding them one after the other on
a single line. For example, you could move and then rotate a cube with
this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
translate([2,2,2]) rotate([45,0,0]) cube(2);
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, you also could place the cube command on the same line, since
there is only one child. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12068openscadf4.large.jpg"><img src="12068openscadf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can apply transformations to your project elements.
</p></div></div><p>
Along with 3D elements, you can build your object out of 2D elements. 
Several basic elements are available, such as circles, squares, polygons
and even text elements. You can use them to build up the surfaces of
your project directly. 
</p><p>
A second way of building 3D objects from 2D
elements is through the process of extruding. Extrusion essentially
takes a 2D shape and extends it through the third dimension. An example
would be getting a cylinder by extruding a circle. This is called linear
extrusion. Rotational extrusion takes a 2D object and rotates it around
some axis in order to generate a 3D object. Taking the circle example,
you could rotate around one of the axes in order to generate a donut shape,
or torus. You can apply the same types of transformations 
that I described for 3D objects too.
</p><p>
Using just the above examples, you already could build rather complex
objects, but another class of functions is available that allows
you to combine multiple objects in other ways. You can merge multiple
overlapping objects together with the union transformation. You can get
only the parts that overlap with the intersect transformation. You 
even can slice away pieces by using the difference transformation to remove
any overlapping sections. There even are program control structures, such as for loops and if-else conditionals. Using all of
these available combinations can lead to rather complex behaviors.
</p><p>
Once you have a project properly defined, you can try rendering
it fully. There are a few different ways to initiate this. You can click on
the Design&rarr;Render menu item, or more directly, you can press the F6
key. 
</p><p>
The console window will give you diagnostic information about what
was done during the rendering, including data like the number of edges,
vertices and facets that were used. 
</p><p>
If you're happy with the way it
turned out, you can export your project a few different ways. You can
export an image of your project as either a PNG file or SVG file by
clicking File&rarr;Export and selecting the file format. You
also can export it into one of several different formats used in other CAD
systems. One of the formats, STL (STereoLithography), is used in several
different systems including 3D printing. Because of its ubiquity, it
has earned its own button at the top of the editor pane.
</p><p>
Although OpenSCAD isn't designed to generate the prettiest rendered images,
hopefully this article has shown you enough so you can see where it might fit
in your workflow. It is a very good program for handling more practical
designing of real objects in a simple way. 
I was able to cover
only a small amount of the available functionality, so don't be afraid of
digging into the OpenSCAD manual to see all the other things
you can do with this software.
