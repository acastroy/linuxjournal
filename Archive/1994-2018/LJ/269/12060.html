Ascensio System SIA's ONLYOFFICE</h2></div></div><p>
Ascensio System SIA boasts that its ONLYOFFICE office and productivity
suite combines the best from the MS Office and Google Docs worlds.
ONLYOFFICE is a free and open-source solution and is distributed under the AGPL
v.3 license. Ascensio says that its solution trumps Google Docs'
collaborative capabilities, allowing users to choose how to co-edit
documents&mdash;for example, &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; (like in Google Docs) or
&ldquo;Strict&rdquo;
(when the changes appear after saving). ONLYOFFICE also out-features MS
Office Online, asserts Ascensio, allowing its users to work with
auto-shapes, -formulas and -charts online. Regarding file formats, Ascensio claims
better support for MS Office formats than any other open-source office
suite, and it is fully compatible with OpenDocument formats as well. The recently
updated ONLYOFFICE 8.9 features the updated collaboration system called
Community Server, which includes mail and calendar integration and mail
autoreply. Meanwhile, the updated document editors, aka the Document
Server, now offer fast real-time co-editing, commenting and integrated
chat, reviewing and tracking changes, and version history.

CodeLathe FileCloud Google Chrome Extension</h2></div></div><p>
Nearly everyone in today's enterprises is connected throughout the day
to a web browser, of which anywhere from 44&ndash;71% are Google Chrome.
Seeking to make this vast number of users' work more productive is
developer CodeLathe, whose new &ldquo;amazingly easy-to-use&rdquo; FileCloud
extension for Google Chrome enables users to save documents, images and
screen captures directly from Chrome to CodeLathe's FileCloud private
cloud file-sharing solution. When using the FileCloud for Chrome extension,
FileCloud users now can save and share information easily while working
within Chrome by selecting content, opening the right-click context
menu in Chrome and then selecting the &ldquo;Save to FileCloud&rdquo; option. The
FileCloud Chrome extension is particularly useful for teams who work
closely together in areas like product and market research, web design
and others. FileCloud client apps are available for common desktop and
mobile platforms including Linux, Mac, iOS, Android, Windows, Windows Phone
8 and now Chrome.

Naztech's Roadstar 5 Car Charger</h2></div></div><p>
The &ldquo;5&rdquo; in Naztech's new Roadstar 5 Car Charger refers to the
abundant five ports offered by the device, intended to end in-vehicle
debates on who gets to charge their device next. Naztech says that its new
charger delivers superior charging power and speed while protecting tablet
and smartphone batteries and motherboards. The Roadstar 5 features a
compact design with five illuminated USB ports integrated on two units. The
main unit that plugs in to the vehicle's electrical outlet offers two
ports with the remaining three found on an extendible hub. Connected by a
six-foot cable, the hub clips onto the backseat or center console, allowing
users to access devices conveniently from anywhere in the car while
charging. The Roadstar 5 integrates Naztech's IntelliQ Technology that
enables smart communication between the charger and the attached devices,
resulting in the optimal and safest delivery of power and current level, as
well as short-circuit and overcharge protection.

Synopsys' Coverity</h2></div></div><p>
The new version 8.5 of Synopsys' Coverity extends the security umbrella
of the static analysis tool to mitigate a wider range of security
vulnerabilities. Coverity, a core component of Synopsys' Software

uncompressed WAV or lossy MP3 format&mdash;into their Nativ Vita

Senet IoT Foundry</h2></div></div><p>
Startup companies and even large enterprises may not be able to harness the
full range of skills required to deliver vertically complete IoT solutions
to their customers. To assist these companies in getting to market and
solving their customers' problems, Senet introduces Senet IoT Foundry,
a suite of development services&mdash;training, development tools,
a network sandbox and technical consulting services&mdash;that help IoT
solution developers create and launch LoRa-compliant IoT products and
applications. Senet calls itself the first and only North American provider
of public, LoRa-based, low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs) for Internet
of Things (IoT) applications, putting it in a strong position to support
companies in their commercialization of LoRa-based LPWAN products and
solutions. Senet is a contributing member of the LoRa Alliance and was the
first in North America to gain FCC certification on LoRa-based sensors and
gateways. As a result, the company claims to possess a treasure chest of
high-level designs, best practices and development tools that can benefit
other ecosystem partners. Users of Senet IoT Foundry services can opt to
follow the Foundry's four-step development program, or pick and choose
the services they need most.

Steven Ovadia's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learn Linux in a Month of Lunches</em></span> (Manning Publications
Co.)</h2></div></div><p>
Yes, Steven Ovadia's new book for Linux &ldquo;noobs&rdquo; is titled
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Learn Linux in a Month of Lunches</em></span>, but readers may
need two-hour lunches
and weekends to attain the ambitious goal implied in the title. No matter
though,
because this &ldquo;study while dining&rdquo; series of books from Manning
Publications offers a fine approach to learning the essentials of our
beloved OS, from installation to networking, installing software and
securing a system. Readers just curious about Linux or needing to get up
and running for their jobs will appreciate how this book concentrates on
need-to-know tasks. By digesting targeted, easy-to-follow, compact lessons,
readers learn how to use the command line, customize a desktop, print,
choose the right application for their needs and more. Readers who make it
to the end of the book are treated to topics like filesystems, GitLab
and using Linux professionally&mdash;for example, certifications. Although new Linux users
may be overwhelmed at first, Ovadia's book illustrates how learning
Linux doesn't have to be hard, and the payoff is great.
