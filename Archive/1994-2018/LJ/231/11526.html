Apache does more than serve Web pages, and now so can you.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x10d6358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I recently received a panicked call from a coworker who was doing a program
demo for a client. The program was Java-based, so it needed to be
deployed to a Java servlet engine. This coworker is a brilliant sysadmin
and trainer, but was completely befuddled by Tomcat. So for this article, I'm 
giving a crash course on Tomcat administration and setup. If you've set
up Java applications before, this article might be mundane, but if you don't
know a JBoss from a Glassfish, read on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x10d6510"></a>
Why Tomcat?</h2></div></div><p>
A person easily could write a book on the various ways to host Java
applications. There are tons of options, ranging from free and open to
commercial and expensive. Usually, when someone talks about serving up a
Java application, Tomcat is the servlet engine of choice. Why? Maybe it's
the cool name. Maybe it's because it's from the Apache folks, so there's
a level of trust. Maybe it's just because it works well. Whatever the
reason, it's a very common way to deploy Java apps, so that's what I
focus on here.
</p><p>
Like most open-source programs, Tomcat will run on multiple
platforms. There is a Windows version, which actually is rather difficult
to install properly. (Running Tomcat as a service in Windows has some
weird issues that must be addressed.) Thankfully, running Tomcat under
Linux is fairly simple, and it runs like any other service. Linux,
we love you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x10d66c8"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installing Tomcat in Linux is so simple that I'm really only going
to mention it. If you need a specific version of Tomcat, or need some
specialty compilation options, it can be a little more complex. If you
have needs that particular, however, chances are you know far more about
Tomcat and Java deployment than this article covers anyway.
</p><p>
Basically, look in your distro's software repository for &ldquo;Tomcat&rdquo;. 
Note that Tomcat is a product from the fine folks at Apache. It's an
entirely different product from the Apache Web server though. It would
be a little less confusing if the Web server had a cool name, like
&ldquo;Apache Bearclaw&rdquo;, to differentiate it from other Apache products,
but sadly, we need to deal with the naming conventions as they are. Most
people use the term &ldquo;Apache&rdquo; for the Web server d&aelig;mon and are confused
with the idea of &ldquo;Apache Tomcat&rdquo; as a completely separate application.
</p><p>
Anyway, find the Tomcat version your distro provides and install
it. It can be from the software center, apt-get, yum or however you
install packages for your distro. Once it's installed, it should start
automatically and be happily running on your system. By default, Tomcat
runs on port 8080. (See, I told you it was different from the Apache
Web server!)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x10d69e0"></a>
Testing</h2></div></div><p>
Before you deploy any Java applications, you should make sure things are
working. The first thing to test is to go to http://localhost:8080 from
your machine. (If it's a headless server, use the server's IP address
from your workstation.) You should see a message similar to that shown in Figure 1. Of
particular note, it mentions a few additional packages for installing. My
example is in Ubuntu, so your distribution may include the management
files with the program installation. Otherwise, like me, you'll need to
install tomcat7-admin. I'm not going to do much with the management
program here, but I want to install it, and point you in that direction for
future exploration!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11526f1.large.jpg"><img src="11526f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. This looks similar to the Apache Web server's test page&mdash;and for good
reason, it's from the same people!
</p></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, the Internet has some non-trustworthy folks attached to
it. By default, Tomcat's admin package disables all access. If you try to
click on that admin link (even after installing the package), you won't
be able to log in. You should get a login prompt, but there aren't any
logins enabled. For that, you need to edit /etc/tomcat7/tomcat-users.xml,
like it says at the bottom of the &ldquo;It Works!&rdquo; page shown in Figure
1. Basically,
you need to add a line like this to the file:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;user name="admin" password="password" roles="manager-gui" /&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Note that using admin/password as your login and password is
a horrible, horrible idea. But this is a magazine article, not a
computer. It's very unlikely my imaginary server will get hacked. Yours,
however, isn't safe. So use a good user/password combination!
</p><p>
Restart the Tomcat process. In Ubuntu, that means:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo service tomcat7 restart
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, try to log in to the management app, located at
http://localhost:8080/manager/.
Obviously, replace localhost with your server name if you're not on the
same machine. After entering your credentials, you should see something
like Figure 2. It gives you some information about the server and also
allows you to deploy WAR files directly via the Web interface. (More
about that in a bit.) If you see the management console, you're in
pretty good shape and have a functional Java Servlet Engine.

Figure 2. The Application Manger makes deploying and undeploying apps
simple. It's important to know what's going on behind the scenes, however.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x10d7118"></a>
Let's Start a WAR</h2></div></div><p>
If anyone ever asked you to set up a Tomcat server, it's probably
because he or she needs to deploy a WAR file. A WAR file (Web
Application aRchive) is a set of Java files bundled up into a single file,
ready to deploy onto a Servlet Engine. If Apache Tomcat were a Nintendo
Entertainment System, the WAR file would be the game cartridge. Once
the WAR file is deployed, it's available to use via the Web browser.
</p><p>
Let's deploy a WAR file to see how it works and see what actually
happens. For my sample, I downloaded a sample WAR file from the Apache
Foundation. If you don't have a favorite WAR file you want to deploy,
you can play along at home by getting the sample WAR file from Apache. You
can find one at
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/appdev/sample/sample.war" target="_self">tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/appdev/sample/sample.war</a>.
</p><p>
In order to deploy a WAR file, you need to copy it to the webapps
folder. Its location may vary based on your distribution (or operating
system, if you're a Windows user), but a quick search of your system
should turn it up. In my Ubuntu server, the webapps folder is located at
/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/.
</p><p>
Tomcat will &ldquo;hot deploy&rdquo; a WAR file if it's copied to that folder,
so simply do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo cp sample.war /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x10d7488"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you should be done. Nothing will be returned on the
command line, but the Tomcat logs should show the application being
deployed. Going back to the Web-based management app from Figure 2,
you'd now see something like Figure 3, which shows the sample.war file
fully deployed and active. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11526f3.large.jpg"><img src="11526f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The new app shows up in the Application Manager. Success!
</p></div></div><p>
Now, if you go to
http://localhost:8080/sample/,
you should see the sample application fully deployed and
working (Figure 4). Deploying other WAR files is basically the
same process. Undeploying them can be done simply by deleting the WAR
file from the webapps folder or clicking &ldquo;Undeploy&rdquo; in the Web-based
management software. In fact, if you remember from my initial look
at the management software, you actually can use the Web interface to 
deploy a WAR file, without ever needing to find the webapps folder on
your own. This doesn't work for really large WAR files, as uploading
via Web browser does have size limitations, but for most deployments,
the management GUI works just fine.

Figure 4. I was going to deploy a game, but I figured a sample application
was more appropriate.

A Few More Tips</h2></div></div><p>
Out of the box, Tomcat works pretty well and is fairly
straightforward. Two of the most common requests are to change the port
to 80 so that it functions without clients needing to enter port
numbers into their browser. The other common request I get is to have
an application deployed at the root level, so no folder name (like the
/sample above) is required to access a single-purpose server. Thankfully,
both are pretty simple.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Changing Ports:</b></span>
</p><p>
On your server, locate the server.xml file for your Tomcat install. On
my Ubuntu box, that's in /etc/tomcat7/. In the server.xml file, you'll
find a section that looks like Figure 5. If you change the port
&ldquo;8080&rdquo;
to &ldquo;80&rdquo;, it will tell the Tomcat server to listen on port 80 instead of
the default 8080.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11526f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The syntax is confusing, but thankfully, you just need to change
&ldquo;8080&rdquo; to &ldquo;80&rdquo;.
</p></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, because Tomcat runs as a nonroot user, telling it to
listen on port 80 doesn't give the d&aelig;mon permissions to listen on the
privileged port. For that, you need to grant permission. It may be a
slightly different procedure on various distributions, but for Ubuntu,
it's pretty straightforward. First, make sure the authbind package is
installed. It most likely was installed with Tomcat, but just be sure
it's installed and working. Then, edit /etc/default/tomcat7 and look for
the line referencing <tt  >AUTHBIND</tt>. (It's probably on the bottom of the file.)
Uncomment the line, and change it to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
AUTHBIND=yes
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, restart Tomcat:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo service tomcat7 restart
</pre>
</p><p>
You should see no errors, and when you try to go to
http://localhost/sample, you should see the same sample you deployed
earlier, but this time, served from port 80. Note that there can 
be only a single d&aelig;mon listening on port 80, so you can't have the Apache
Web server listening on port 80 (its default), and then expect Tomcat
to work on the same port. Changing Tomcat to port 80 makes sense
only if it's the only server trying to serve content on port 80. Hopefully,
that makes sense.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Deploying an Application at the Root Level:</b></span>
</p><p>
This last tidbit actually is quite simple, but it wasn't obvious to
me at first. If you look in your webapps folder, you'll see there is a
ROOT folder. That ROOT folder is what holds the &ldquo;It Works!&rdquo; page Tomcat
delivers by default. If you want to put your application at the root
level, it's just a matter of deleting that ROOT folder:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x14d0548"></a></h2></div></div><p>
(Note: be careful with <tt  >rm -rf</tt>; that's some powerful stuff.)
</p><p>
Then, change the name of your WAR file to
ROOT.war.
</p><p>
After that, simply deploy the WAR file like you did with the sample.war
file, and it will be accessible at the root level of the Tomcat
server&mdash;pretty simple!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfde580.0x14d0758"></a>
There's More, So Much More</h2></div></div><p>
This article is intended to get you started with Apache's Tomcat
d&aelig;mon. There are plenty of tricks you can do in order to server Java
applications alongside standard Web sites. You also can secure Tomcat with
an SSL certificate just like a Web server. Once you understand how Tomcat
works and how it's set up, it's far less scary to deploy Java apps
in your production environment.
</p><p>
Next month, I plan to go further into setting up a heterogeneous
environment that incorporates Java and standard Web apps. Plus, I want
to give some tips on how to do all that from a single IP address. If
you found this article interesting, you should be excited for next month!
