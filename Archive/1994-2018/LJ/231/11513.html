<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #231, July 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tejun Heo</b></span> has replaced <span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Garzik</b></span> as the official <span   class="bold"><b>SATA</b></span> maintainer. Jeff, who's
been contributing to Linux since the early days, announced that he's moving away
from kernel development altogether and is going to work on other open-source
projects. I'm sure they'll be better for his interest.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sarah Sharp</b></span> has made a number of updates to the
<span   class="bold"><b>REPORTING-BUGS</b></span> document, cleaning
it up and making it easier for frustrated and stressed bug victims to follow. Along
with other details, the new text clarifies exactly what information to include,
whom to contact and when, and how long to wait before pinging the person again.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Ahmad Sharif</b></span>, one of the <span   class="bold"><b>ChromeOS</b></span> developers, has announced <span   class="bold"><b>Quipper</b></span>, a new open-source library that creates <span   class="bold"><b>perf</b></span> reports. In fact, in addition to presenting
information, it converts perf data to <span   class="bold"><b>Google's
protobuf</b></span> format, which Ahmad
argues is more stable and flexible than perf's native data format. The whole
point of Quipper, and perf, is to help developers figure out how to make their
code run faster.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tim Bird</b></span> recently asked about the best way for a
<span   class="bold"><b>GPS</b></span> receiver to interface with
the kernel. His company, <span   class="bold"><b>Sony</b></span>, was interested in writing up some Linux support
for its GPS devices. However, as <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span> pointed out, this is not an
easy question to answer, thanks to the diversity of hardware implementations and
the tendency of some implementations to masquerade as others. In Sony's case, the
best solution would depend on the hardware involved. So the real answer would
require Sony to divulge the details of its hardware, which it may not be
ready to do.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Simon Glass</b></span> has submitted some patches to
implement the <span   class="bold"><b>ChromeOS Embedded
Controller</b></span>. This code would allow <span   class="bold"><b>Chromebooks</b></span> to charge their batteries, read
keyboard input and do other tasks related to making the thing go. <span   class="bold"><b>Samuel Ortiz</b></span>
accepted the patches without needing too many changes. ChromeOS, like <span   class="bold"><b>Android</b></span>,
seems well accepted into kernel architecture.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Classic Shell</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #231, July 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Even those of us on the Linux side of the fence have been watching
Microsoft's Windows 8 roll-out&mdash;albeit for us, it has been with morbid
fascination. Granted, we're not without our drastic changes (ahem,
Unity), but the new interface Microsoft has chosen for version 8 is
seemingly unusable for most people. The iconic Start menu has been
taken away without a clear replacement.
</p><p>
If you're stuck on a Windows 8 machine and wish you had a Start
menu, fear not; the Open Source community is here to help. With Classic
Shell, not only can you get a Start menu back, but you also can choose what
it looks like and configure every aspect of the menu system you can
imagine. Prefer the Windows XP look? No problem. Is Windows 7 your idea
of the perfect Windows experience? No problem there either.
</p><p>
Classic Shell is an open-source project originally developed back in
the Windows Vista days. Thankfully, it's been updated for the Windows
8 platform, and thanks to Microsoft's design decisions, it's more useful
than ever! Grab yourself a copy today at <a href="http://www.classicshell.net" target="_self">www.classicshell.net</a>.

<h2 class="title">There's Browser in My SSH</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #231, July 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
No, there's SSH in my browser! Although it may not be as logical of a
combination as chocolate and peanut butter, for Chromebook users, an
HTML5 SSH client is pretty amazing. Granted, Google's &ldquo;crosh&rdquo; shell
has SSH abilities, but it's a very limited implementation. With the
Chrome extension &ldquo;Secure Shell&rdquo;, it's easy to SSH in to remote servers
and interact like a traditional terminal window&mdash;mostly.
</p><p>
Secure Shell is getting better all the time, and at the time of this writing,
it supports port forwarding, logging in with keys, socks proxying
and even many keyboard shortcuts for programs like Irssi. The keyboard
shortcut support isn't perfect, but for me at least, it's manageable.

</p></div></div><p>
If you're a Chromebook user and want a real SSH client, give the
&ldquo;Secure Shell&rdquo; extension a try. Heck, regardless of the OS you're
using (I'm looking at you, Windows), it's a fast way to get a secure
connection. It's being developed by Google, and it's free via the Play
Store: <a href="http://goo.gl/irXYG" target="_self">goo.gl/irXYG</a>.

<h2 class="title">Sleep as Android</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #231, July 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I sleep poorly. In fact, insomnia has plagued me for years. As it turns
out, even when I think I'm sleeping well, I'm usually not. There's
nothing worse than a shoddy night's sleep followed by an abrupt alarm
going off when you've finally settled into a deep slumber.
</p><p>
Enter: Sleep as Android.
</p><p>
By using the accelerometer in your phone, Sleep as Android not only tracks
how restful your sleep was during the night, but it also determines the
best moment to wake you up. Rather than setting an exact time to wake
up, you enter a &ldquo;time range&rdquo; in which you'd like to be woken. Sleep as
Android looks for a time during that range where you're sleeping lightly
(or not at all) and goes off. More times than not, it means waking up
feeling refreshed, as opposed to my normal routine: groggy and coffee-starved. If you have trouble sleeping, or just prefer to wake up feeling
refreshed, give Sleep as Android a try. It's free for two weeks, then only
$2.99 if you want to keep it. I've listed only some of the features here, but
check it out,
it's truly an awesome program: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sleepasandroid/home" target="_self">https://sites.google.com/site/sleepasandroid/home</a>.

<h2 class="title">Developing Your Own Scientific Python Code</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #231, July 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In many cases, scientific research takes you into totally new areas
of knowledge, never before explored by others. This means the
computational work you need to do may be totally new as well. Although
typically such code development still happens in C or FORTRAN, Python
is growing in popularity. This is especially true in physics. 
</p><p>
If you are just working on a small code base, a basic text editor is fine;
however,
once your project reaches a certain size, using a proper IDE is a huge
advantage. Luckily, an open-source project seeks to fill
this exact niche: Spyder. Spyder is available for Windows, Mac OS X and
Linux. You should be able to find a package for your distribution, but if not,
you always can grab the binaries or source code at the main Spyder Web
site (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib" target="_self">code.google.com/p/spyderlib</a>). 
</p><p>
Spyder actually is
written in Python, and it has been designed with
a plugin architecture. This means you can add extra functionality
by installing plugins. If you can't find a plugin for the functionality
you need, you always can write your own.
</p><p>
When you start Spyder, several panes open and a
temporary Python script that you can use to start editing appears.
The main pane is the editor, where the temporary script is loaded and
ready for you to start working. The right-hand side of the window is
broken into two more panes. The bottom pane is the console to a running
Python interpreter. Here you can see that Spyder automatically loads
NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib on startup, so you already have
most of the tools you likely will need ready to go. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11513spyf1.large.jpg"><img src="11513spyf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you start Spyder, several information panes along
with the main editor pane appear.
</p></div></div><p>
You can use
this console just as you would any other Python interpreter. The top
pane has multiple tabs. The first tab that opens at start up is an object
inspector. This tab lets you look at the details of any objects being
used in your code. The other tabs available are a variable
inspector and a file explorer. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11513spyf2.large.jpg"><img src="11513spyf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The object inspector lets you look at the details of any objects you
may want to use.
</p></div></div><p>
Let's begin by looking at the main editor
pane. Like any other programming editor, Spyder provides
full-color highlighting of Python syntax. Rope is used to provide code
introspection capabilities to the editor. If you start typing a function
call, Spyder makes suggestions for code completion. 
</p><p>
Pyflakes provides
on-the-fly code analysis. Any errors in your code are highlighted right
away with a triangle symbol in the margin. When you hover over it,
details for the error are displayed in a pop-up window. You also can set
breakpoints in the editor that are used by the Python debugger. This way,
you have a bit of control over how your code runs when you run it under
the pdb debugger.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11513spyf3.large.jpg"><img src="11513spyf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can set all of the options for the editor window in the
preferences section.
</p></div></div><p>
The console pane provides a full set of tools for controlling multiple
interpreters. When you run a script from the editor, you
have the option of starting up a new interpreter in which to run it. Or, you
can run it in an existing interpreter. You can set this behavior in Spyder's
preferences. You also simply can create a new interpreter from
the console pane directly. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11513spyf4.large.jpg"><img src="11513spyf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The preferences for the console section control things like whether
it is monitored and so forth.
</p></div></div><p>
Also interesting is that you can create IPython
interpreters in the console. Then, you have all of the extra functionality
provided by IPython at your disposal. One of these advanced features
is the ability to use multiple IPython engines in parallel. From the
console in Spyder, you can create these IPython engines that will run
in the background, ready to be used for whatever parallel processing
you may have in mind. So, not only can you develop your new scientific
code as a parallel program, you also can work with it directly from Spyder,
in parallel. All of these extra interpreters and engines run as separate
processes, which means they will not affect Spyder itself or cause it
to hang if something bad happens within one of the Python interpreters.
</p><p>
One of the extra tabs in the top-right pane brings up the variable
explorer. This pane gives you a list of all the variables
currently active in the memory space within Spyder. It shows
the name, type, size and value for each of the variables accessible in
the global namespace. This applies to both the internal Python interpreter
and any external ones. The variable explorer can handle all of the
standard data types, like strings, integers and floats. It also includes
an array editor that can be used to edit lists and tuples. The array
editor provides a nice environment for editing complex data types. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11513spyf5.large.jpg"><img src="11513spyf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The variable explorer gives you a list of everything within the
global namespace.
</p></div></div><p>
Spyder
provides even more tools though. By right-clicking on a list or tuple,
you can do some basic data analysis. Spyder allows you to plot the values
in the data object to see what it looks like. Or, you can
look at a histogram of the values if a statistical analysis would make
more sense.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11513spyf6.large.jpg"><img src="11513spyf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Spyder lets you plot the data within a list or tuple.
</p></div></div><p>
All of these tools are handy, but by themselves, they aren't enough if you
are developing a large code base. In such cases, you will need some
kind of project-level organization. Spyder can help in that situation too. You
can create a project in order to encapsulate a group of files as a single
unit. Creating a new project makes a new folder to store all of the
associated files. Opening this new project creates a new pane where
you can work with the project files. By right-clicking on the project,
you can create a new file, folder, module or package. When you create
a new file, Spyder opens it up in the editor, ready for you to start working on
it. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11513spyf7.large.jpg"><img src="11513spyf7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. If you are working on a larger code base, the project explorer will
come in very handy.
</p></div></div><p>
The last tool you should be aware of is the profiler. The
first step in program development is writing code that works. After that,
your job is to write code that is as efficient as possible. The rule
of thumb is to optimize last, and only what needs to be optimized. But,
what part of your program is that? Without reliable measurements, you
won't know what needs optimizing. In Spyder, you can click on the menu
item Run&rarr;Profile or press F10. This runs your code under the
Python profiler, giving you a breakdown of where all the time is
being spent. Once you have this information, you can focus your energies
where they will do the most good.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11513spyf8.large.jpg"><img src="11513spyf8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The profiler opens a new pane at the bottom of the window, showing
you numbers of calls and time for each function.
</p></div></div><p>
Hopefully, you can take Spyder and run with it while developing your
own scientific Python code. Although lots of IDEs exist for
developing code, there aren't very many setups geared toward
developing scientific code. With Spyder, you should have a head start
in developing your new breakthrough code, solving the problem that could
win you the next Nobel Prize.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: MightyText, Mighty Awesome</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #231, July 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I'll admit, I've always been impressed with Apple's iMessage
program. With its integration into texting, it seamlessly combines
instant messaging and SMS into a single communication stream. Whether on
an iPhone, iPod, iPad or Macintosh, the messages can be seen and sent
to other Apple devices. The only downfall is that you can send only SMS
messages to non-Apple phones from your actual iPhone with a texting plan.
</p><p>
MightyText takes the idea of integration in a slightly different, but
also slightly more awesome, direction. If you have an Android phone,
once you install the Free MightyText application, you can text back
and forth from <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> browser on <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> computer, regardless of the operating
system! It includes MMS pictures, group texting and all the other cool
features that traditionally are available only from a phone.
</p><p>
If you've been wavering back and forth about getting an iPhone or an
Android device, MightyText might be the application that seals the deal
for you. It was for me. In fact, MightyText is so incredibly useful,
we've given it the Editors' Choice award this month. Check it out
now at <a href="http://mightytext.net" target="_self">mightytext.net</a>.
