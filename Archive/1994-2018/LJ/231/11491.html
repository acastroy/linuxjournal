This article reviews a number of popular IPv6 tunneling protocols to help
you
decide which one to use when getting your LAN IPv6-connected. Read about
the strengths and weaknesses of each protocol, and learn 
how to transition your IPv4 LAN to a dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 network.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b84580.0x1c7c250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
IPv6 is the next-generation version of the IP protocol, designed to
replace IPv4 and solve the problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. While
IPv4 designates 4 bytes per IP address (roughly 4 billion addresses),
IPv6 designates 16 addresses (4 billion to the fourth power). Indeed,
there are so many addresses that a typical home LAN would be allocated
a /64 network, or 4 billion squared.
</p><p>
IPv6 already is available through some ISPs, such as AT&amp;T and Comcast,
in select areas. However, not everyone is lucky enough to have the
connectivity. For starters, wired copper connections require DOCSIS
3 modems, which not all ISPs provision. Second, your home or
small-office router must support IPv6 as well. Finally, although most
desktop/laptop OSes do support IPv6, certain devices, such as
Microsoft's Xbox, do not. On the mobile-phone and tablet front, things
are mixed as well. For example, T-Mobile has support only for certain phones
(<a href="http://support.t-mobile.com/message/140209#140209" target="_self">support.t-mobile.com/message/140209#140209</a>), and the setup process
is not straightforward.
</p><p>
On the positive side, core Internet services, such as DNS and
large data centers and networks, are much closer to IPv6
deployment. Companies like Google, Facebook and WikiMedia have enabled
IPv6 across their servers and are processing a fraction of their traffic
over the new protocol. As IPv4 addresses become more and more expensive,
IPv6 is becoming more and more attractive to networks and Web site
operators alike.
</p><p>
All in all, IPv6 deployment is a chicken-and-egg problem. The more consumers there are with IPv6-enabled, or even IPv6-only
connectivity, the more that Web site operators will support IPv6. On the
other hand, as more IPv6-accessible content becomes available, IPv6
connectivity will become a priority and a competitive point for
ISPs. Google has been collecting statistics about IPv6 connectivity,
both overall and by country (<a href="http://www.google.com/ipv6/statistics.html" target="_self">www.google.com/ipv6/statistics.html</a>), 
and it estimates that as of March 2013, more than 1% of its traffic comes in
the form of IPv6. Although the figure may seem low, that number grew 500%
since March 2011 and shows no signs of slowing down.
</p><p>
Amidst this grand shift of underlying protocols on the Internet, you can
help by becoming one more Internet denizen with IPv6 connectivity, even if
your ISP does not support IPv6 natively. This is accomplished by setting
up a tunnel between your IPv6 only network and a tunnel broker. A
tunnel broker is an entity that provides you with an IPv6 address set
(a subnet) and a way to communicate to one of its &ldquo;points of
presence&rdquo;
or PoPs via a special tunneling protocol. 
</p><p>
In this article, I review
my experiences and observations of several of these tunneling protocols.
I also look at their advantages and disadvantages, and provide basic instructions on
how to get started with them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b84580.0x1c7c720"></a>
Equipment You Will Need</h2></div></div><p>
Generally, the most important bit of equipment you will need is an
IPv6-capable router. Some consumer-grade routers now come with IPv6
support, but you also may be able to &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; your existing router
by using third-party firmware, such as Tomato, DD-WRT, OpenWRT and so on.
When selecting an IPv6-capable router, it is important to make
sure that it also comes with an IPv6 firewall. A major change from
IPv4 to IPv6 for consumer LANs is that with IPv4, your NAT used to act
like a firewall. Indeed, by default, none of the hosts behind your NAT
were accessible from the outside world. If you wanted to have
access to a Web server, a game server or NAS from the Internet, you
had to &ldquo;forward ports&rdquo; in your router's settings. 
</p><p>
This isn't the
case with IPv6. In
fact, the whole point of IPv6 is to provide at least one globally unique
address to every host on your network. This opens up your printer to
everyone in the world who has IPv6 connectivity. Although this isn't the
most likely scenario, others might connect to it and use it as their
own. Things like computers with Webcams, NAS devices and so on are all
susceptible to this issue.
</p><p>
Despite this grim outlook, remember that NAT never was meant to be
a security system. That is the job of your firewall. It is simple to
disallow forwarding of any incoming connections by default and then
enable specific ports to be allowed using a good firewall. Thus, when
looking for a new IPv6-capable router, make sure to get one with a
built-in firewall control panel. This will make it a lot easier than
dealing with ip6tables and the like on the command line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b84580.0x1c7c988"></a>
IPv6 Addresses</h2></div></div><p>
IPv6 addresses are composed of 128 bits. A typical IPv6 address looks
like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. Note that leading zeros
may be omitted like so: 2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8a2e:370:7334. Further,
groups of zeros may be skipped once in the address by using the double
: symbol, like so: 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334. In this manner, an
address like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001 could be written
as 2001:db8:85a3::1.
</p><p>
An IPv6 also is logically divided into the network prefix and
subnet parts, with the first and second 64 bits devoted to each,
respectively. Therefore, in the example above, the network prefix is
2001:db8:85a3:0, and the local part is :0:8a2e:370:7334. Currently,
an IPv6 address cannot be routed to more than one subnet using a /64
network prefix. If you are interested in that type of functionality,
you need to secure a larger network prefix, such as a /48 (where
only the first 48 bits are the network prefix).
</p><p>
To learn more about IPv6 addressing, read the IPv6
address page on Wikipedia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_address</a>).
</p><p>
In a lot of cases, a modern operating system can use what is called
&ldquo;stateless autoconfiguration&rdquo;, where given a subnet prefix and the
MAC address of the network interface, a globally unique IPv6 address,
may be constructed. This is done by combining those two pieces of data
using a predictable algorithm. Although convenient, this may create privacy
concerns, as a Web site operator will know your computer's globally unique
MAC address. To address this, some operating systems implement what is
called IPv6 privacy extensions, where in addition to the static IPv6
address, a dynamic one is generated periodically (typically every hour)
and used for making outgoing connections. This does not guarantee
privacy (after all, your network/subnet prefix is always known), but it does
let you hide your MAC address. This functionality typically is disabled
on servers and routers, and enabled on end-user hosts.
</p><p>
Note: if you are used to remembering IPv4 addresses of certain hosts,
your life will become a lot more difficult when using IPv6. Instead, you should
use DNS to set up easy-to-remember hostnames. Using DNS with IPv6 is
fairly straightforward, but an in-depth discussion of it warrants its
own article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b84580.0x1c7cca0"></a>
6in4, aka Static Tunnel, aka Protocol 41</h2></div></div><p>
If you are lucky enough to have a stable, or at least infrequently
changing IPv4 address from your ISP, and you have full control of
your router, this method is likely to be the most stable
option. Static 6in4 tunnels typically are established with one of
the popular tunnel brokers, such as Hurricane Electric's Tunnel Broker
(<a href="https://tunnelbroker.net" target="_self">https://tunnelbroker.net</a>), SixXS (<a href="https://sixxs.net" target="_self">https://sixxs.net</a>, pronounced &ldquo;Six
Access&rdquo;) or one of many others. When you sign up for an account with
one of the tunnel brokers, you are given the opportunity to create
a tunnel and a subnet that you then can use. 
</p><p>
Now, some terminology is in
order:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Tunnel ID: typically, a tunnel will have a unique identifier that you
may use in various configuration files.
</p></li><li><p>
Server IPv4 address: the IPv4 endpoint of the tunnel broker's PoP. Most
tunnel brokers let you find a PoP that is closest to you geographically,
in order to reduce latency.
</p></li><li><p>
Server IPv6 address: the IPv6 address of the server to which you will be
connecting. This address is unique to your tunnel.
</p></li><li><p>
Client IPv4 address: your router's IPv4 address.
</p></li><li><p>
Client IPv6 address: your router's IPv6 address.
</p></li><li><p>
Routed /64 or routed /48: this is the subnet within which you will
assign addresses to all your hosts. Somewhat confusingly, your router
also may have an address in this subnet.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Note: the routed /64 and the client/server IPv6 address 
usually will differ by 1 in one of the digits. Do not confuse them in your
configuration files, as using one in place of the other will not work.
</p><p>
Once you set up your account, you will be given the values for all of the
above-mentioned items. You then will be able to put them into the router
settings for IPv6. Once everything is plugged in, your router should have
IPv6 connectivity. This means you can use an on-line ping6 tool (such as
<a href="http://www.subnetonline.com/pages/ipv6-network-tools/online-ipv6-ping.php" target="_self">www.subnetonline.com/pages/ipv6-network-tools/online-ipv6-ping.php</a>)
to test that your client IPv6 address is accessible. Similarly, if you
have command-line access to your router, you can run the following to test that
your router can access IPv6-enabled hosts:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ping6 google.com
</pre>
</p><p>
The next step is to assign addresses to the rest of the hosts on
your LAN. Under the hood, this typically is done using a tool called
radvd, which stands for router advertisement d&aelig;mon. This d&aelig;mon 
periodically will send out ICMPv6 packets indicating which IPv6 network prefix
may be used by the hosts on the LAN. Each IPv6-capable host on your LAN
then will use this prefix, along with its MAC address to determine a
static, globally accessible IPv6 address for itself, and will set up a
proper routing table.
</p><p>
Note that you likely also will want to enable the IPv6 firewall on your router
prior to enabling address assignment for the rest of your LAN. Typically,
you will want to allow all connections that originate on your routed subnet
and disallow all others. You also may want to enable SSH access if that
is something you use, for either specific hosts or all the hosts on the
network, by allowing connections to port 22.
</p><p>
If your router does not natively support IPv6, you can use a
different computer as your IPv6 router. There are more detailed guides
elsewhere that will walk you through the necessary steps for each OS
and distribution, but the steps roughly are as follows:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Set the computer as the DMZ machine in your router (necessary for it
to be reachable via protocol 41).
</p></li><li><p>
Enable the IPv6 firewall on the computer.
</p></li><li><p>
Enable IPv6 routing.
</p></li><li><p>
Set up the IPv6 tunnel.
</p></li><li><p>
Set up LAN address assignment to give IPv6 addresses to the rest of
your LAN.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Small computers with low power consumption, such as Raspberry Pis, can be
used for this purpose if you don't want to replace your current router.
</p><p>
Which tunnel broker should you choose? That question 
requires you to do some homework. The biggest consideration for choosing
a tunnel broker is whether it has a PoP fairly close to you. If you live
in Los Angeles, but your PoP is in Amsterdam, your latency will suffer.
</p><p>
Hurricane Electric's tunnel broker and SixXS both have a large number of
PoPs in the US, Europe and Asia. Wikipedia has a larger list of tunnel
brokers (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IPv6_tunnel_brokers" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IPv6_tunnel_brokers</a>). SixXS
is the largest, judging by the PoP size (52 as of March 2013).
</p><p>
There is also a difference in the style of service provided by these
operators. Hurricane Electric's tunnel broker is a free, no-strings-attached service with good support from Hurricane Electric. The company
provides many other paid services, and tunnelbroker.net is, if anything,
a way for people to be aware of its other offerings.
</p><p>
SixXS, on the other hand, is a nonprofit service directed at end users. It
comes with some strings attached, the biggest of which is that all
requests for tunnels, subnets and so on must be reviewed by a SixXS volunteer
before being approved. There also is a point system, where you may lose
points, and therefore privileges, if you do not keep your static tunnel
running. Do not let this discourage you. Although it seems like there are
more hoops to jump through, there also is a helpful community behind
this project, and in some cases, it is easier to set up the tunnel and
keep it running, because SixXS provides its AICCU software&mdash;a d&aelig;mon
that will keep all your configuration up to date at all times.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b84580.0x1c7dc18"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>A Note about Protocol 41</b></p><p>
Protocol 41 is an IP-level protocol where an
IPv6 header follows an IPv4 header immediately. It is on the same level
in the OSI model as TCP and UDP. The upside of it is that it minimizes
protocol overhead, thereby potentially improving performance. The
downside is that it is a somewhat unusual protocol that may be blocked
by your ISP or a network operator that is between your ISP and the PoP
you are trying to use. Typically, ISPs do not make a habit of blocking
protocol 41, but it is possible that they might. If you can confirm that
this is the case, you may want to ask your ISP to unblock it, or look into
a tunnel type that is not based on protocol 41.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b84580.0x2076078"></a>
6in4 Heartbeat</h2></div></div><p>
The 6in4 heartbeat tunnel is a variant of the static 6in4 tunnel, where a
heartbeat allows for dynamically changing IPv4 address to be updated
with the server. If you do not have a static IPv4 address from your ISP,
this may be a very good choice for you, because it will mean uninterrupted
service, even if your IPv4 address gets updated. Currently, only SixXS
offers this type of tunnel; however, Hurricane Electric's tunnel broker
provides a way to update your IPv4 address periodically over HTTP to
achieve a similar effect. The beauty of the 6in4 heartbeat protocol
is that when your IPv4 address is not changing, you are using a static
IPv6 tunnel with all of its benefits, such as having a permanent IPv6
address for all your hosts, low protocol overhead and a stable PoP. In
many cases, if your router supports it, the 6in4 heartbeat from SixXS
is the best choice.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b84580.0x20761d8"></a>
Anything-in-Anything, aka AYIYA</h2></div></div><p>
AYIYA is different from 6in4 in that it does not use protocol
41. Instead, IPv6 packets are encapsulated in UDP/IPv4 packets. This
introduces more overhead, as there are more packet headers. It does
provide some very nice benefits, such as increased security and being able
to traverse NAT boundaries, and it is harder for your ISP to block.
</p><p>
Currently, SixXS is the only tunnel broker that provides AYIYA tunnels,
but because it is the largest tunnel broker, that should not
deter you. AYIYA with SixXS is also exempt from losing credits with SixXS
if they are not up and running, because they are specifically designed to
be dynamic.
</p><p>
Unlike 6in4, each packet over AYIYA is signed using a shared secret,
allowing for greater security. As with other tunnel types from SixXS,
its official client, AICCU, automatically brings up this type of
tunnel for you.
</p><p>
Because AYIYA uses UDP, it is able to traverse most typical types of
NAT without any special cooperation from the router. This means that
if your router does not support IPv6 tunneling natively, or if you do not
have control over your router, you still may be able to get your entire
LAN IPv6-connected using this protocol. To do so, you would designate a
computer inside your LAN/NAT as the IPv6 router and firewall, bring up
an AYIYA tunnel on it, and then use radvd to give addresses to the rest of
the hosts on your network.
</p><p>
Another use case for AYIYA is when you want
IPv6-connectivity on the go. A
typical coffee shop likely will not provide you with IPv6 access. If you
want to connect to IPv6 resources from a coffee shop, Internet caf&eacute;
or
the like, you could set up an AYIYA tunnel on your laptop and turn
it on only when you are at one of these locations. Once again, because AYIYA
looks like UDP/IPv4, the network operator is not likely to block it. In
this use case, you would be able to connect to your hosts on your home
or office network, because they will have static IPv6 addresses. Indeed,
this is how I typically work remotely: <tt  >ssh</tt> to my workstation at home or
at the office from whatever network I happen to be on.
</p><p>
AYIYA does have some disadvantages. Due to its nature, it has more
protocol overhead. Additionally, when traversing a NAT, your router
will treat this traffic like any other UDP traffic, so if are using
some type of QoS rule set, you may want to adjust it to allow AYIYA
to have a sufficiently high priority (since it can carry all types of
traffic of its own, from DNS requests to streaming video). Generally,
a static tunnel is preferred vs. AYIYA, but certain distinct use cases
make AYIYA more appealing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b84580.0x2076548"></a>
6to4 Tunneling</h2></div></div><p>
6to4 tunnels (note that 6to4 is different from 6in4, although the two are related)
are based on a protocol that is meant to be used during the transitional
period, when both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled. A 6in4 tunnel uses protocol
41, just like 6in4. The difference is that instead of having an explicit
tunnel provider with an account, a routed subnet and so on, your host's
address is determined purely by its public IPv4 address. Each host
on the public IPv4 Internet is given an IPv6 address that starts with
2002. For example, if your public IPv4 address was 192.0.2.4, your IPv6
address would be 2002:c000:0204::1/48 (192 becomes c0, 0 becomes 00,
2 and 4 become 02 and 04, respectively). You can choose a suffix other
than ::1. Indeed, using this method, you have an entire /48 network,
giving you an 80-bit address space to play with. You can use this address
space to allocate addresses to the rest of your LAN.
</p><p>
On the surface, it would seem that a 6to4 tunnel is preferable to
a static 6in4 tunnel. Indeed, it is easier to configure, requiring
commands using /sbin/ip on Linux, for example. It does, however,
have several downsides that generally would disqualify it from being
used in practice. First, your IPv6 address would depend on your IPv4
address. This means that if your IPv4 address changes, so does the IPv6
one. If you are using a static 6in4 tunnel, your IPv6 address always
is the same, which can be a big deal if you want to access hosts inside
your LAN while on the go.
</p><p>
Additionally, when using 6to4, you are going to route your traffic
through an anycasted IPv4 address, which may or may not be ideally
located compared to where you are. With a static 6in4 tunnel, you get
to choose your PoP, and your network becomes predictable.
</p><p>
All in all, 6to4 is best avoided, unless other methods of obtaining IPv6
connectivity are not available.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b84580.0x2076758"></a>
Teredo</h2></div></div><p>
Teredo is a last-resort protocol. It should not be used in any but the
most dire circumstances. However, it is important to cover it here, because it
does provide distinct benefits in some limited circumstances. Teredo's
claim to fame is its ease of use. There are no accounts to set up,
no tunnels to configure, and no firewall rules to write. Teredo is an IPv6
in UDP/IPv4 protocol, similar to AYIYA. The difference is that it also
includes a clever address assignment scheme whereby your public IPv4
address and your private IPv4 address on your LAN are combined and used as
a part of the IPv6 address. Theoretically, even if your computer is behind
several layers of NAT, you still can get IPv6 connectivity using Teredo.
</p><p>
Although the above upside to Teredo is a big win for this tunnel
type, it has several downsides. First, not all types of NAT are
supported. Specifically, a Teredo tunnel cannot traverse a symmetric
NAT. While this NAT type typically is not found on consumer LANs, it is
possible to encounter it on networks you do not control.
</p><p>
Second, only a single address is assigned to each tunnel
endpoint. Therefore, it is impossible to connect several hosts to the
IPv6 Internet using a single Teredo tunnel. Instead, each host would
have to run its own Teredo tunnel. Although most desktop/laptop operating
systems are capable of this, other devices, such as mobile phones and
tablets, are not able to do this, even though they are perfectly capable
of connecting to an IPv6-enabled LAN.
</p><p>
Third, the IPv6 address you get is not static. In essence, you can connect
to IPv6-enabled resources, but others cannot connect to you. This point
alone may override the usefulness of Teredo for most LAN operators.
</p><p>
Finally, I have seen several coffee-shop networks where Teredo did not work,
while AYIYA did. This may be an issue if this is your primary reason
for using Teredo.
</p><p>
A typical use case for Teredo is when you do not already have an AYIYA
tunnel set up with SixXS, are on the go and are trying to access
hosts on your home/office LAN over IPv6. In that case, simply fire up
a Teredo tunnel, and if there is no filtering on your on-the-go LAN,
you will get IPv6 connectivity. On Linux, Teredo is implemented with
a software package called miredo. Simply installing it on one of the
popular distributions will bring up a Teredo tunnel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b84580.0x2076a18"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
If you have an interest in trying out IPv6 on your workstation or LAN in
your home or office, you have many options. When choosing the tunneling
method, your best bet is going to be a static 6in4 tunnel from Hurricane
Electric's tunnel broker or a 6in4 heartbeat tunnel from SixXS. Another
option you may consider will include AYIYA if you do not control your
router, or if the router is incapable of IPv6 routing or if you are frequently
on the go. Finally, 6to4 tunneling and Teredo are available as last-resort
options when for whatever reason nothing else will work.
</p><p>
Happy IPv6 networking!

After choosing your method of tunneling and getting accounts set
up, you likely are going to need to read about setting up firewall
rules. SixXS has a wiki page dedicated to ip6tables, the Linux IPv6
firewall (<a href="http://www.sixxs.net/wiki/IPv6_Firewalling" target="_self">www.sixxs.net/wiki/IPv6_Firewalling</a>). Note that if
you are familiar with the IPv4 firewall, iptables, ip6tables will feel
very familiar.
</p><p>
Additionally, you may want to learn more about radvd, the
router advertisement d&aelig;mon. Most UNIX-like operating systems
have radvd in their repositories. A good starting place for
