I made something recently that you might find interesting: a
hacking contest embedded on an ultra-light live CD (less than 30MB).
</p><p>
Just pop the ISO in VirtualBox or your favorite virtualization tool,
and enjoy (ahem, struggle?) crunching through the levels. See the following

<span   class="emphasis"><em>However</em></span>, it really made me realize just how terrible I am at hacking! I don't

know what it looks like when you get past the first level.&mdash;Shawn Powers

IPv6</h4><p>
We asked readers to write in and let us know whether they are using IPv6, and
if so, what they do with it. Read on to see what they had to say.

</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Thomas2:</b></span>
</p><p>
For one, I did the IPv6 certificate with Hurricane Electric, and you need one
running. You also get a very geeky T-shirt when you succeed.
I am (one of many hats) a network admin and want to stay up to date. I actually
had to use IPv6 at work once, just for a PoC. This was just a local internal
setup. At home, I have a permanent IPv6 setup via Hurricane Electric tunnel.
I also had IPv6 a while ago on my server on the Internet, but I moved and
didn't get a chance to set it up again. My hoster provides IPv6 via a tunnel
(tunnel endpoint on their end), so I do send e-mail right now via IPv6.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, my ISP does not support IPv6 natively. I am in the UK, and native
IPv6 is very, very rare here (there
is one provider, but for businesses).
So, I am running a tunnel with HE, and it works just fine.
</p><p>
Even though I am &ldquo;certified&rdquo; IPv6 with Hurricane Electric and do have some
experience, it still is different in an enterprise. It is new, and people need to get to know it
first. I have found that there are a lot of misunderstandings about
IPv6. I like it though, and with my /48 and /64 address ranges, I have enough
IP addresses, which is good&mdash;you can have never enough.
</p><p>
I wish I could deploy/migrate an IPv6 network in an enterprise soon&mdash;I really
would love that.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sending e-mail via IPv6 counts as something more than,
&ldquo;just to see
 if I can do it&rdquo;&mdash;thanks!&mdash;Shawn Powers</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Scott Gilbert:</b></span>
</p><p>
All of my hosted VPSes have native IPv6. On some of them, I've removed the IPv4
addresses, so they are <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> accessible via IPv6.
</p><p>
Alas, at home, my ISP (US/Texas) does not provide IPv6, so I use a tunnel from
he.net to my router (running OpenWRT). When I set this up two or three years ago, I
was really disappointed in the level of IPv6 support from consumer wireless
routers. It looks like things have improved somewhat since then, but v6 support
still seems like an afterthought for most products.
</p><p>
What do I use it for? Well, everything that traditionally used IPv4, of course!
(SSH, HTTP, IMAP, SMTP, BT and so on.)
</p><p>
As I see it, we will all migrate to IPv6 eventually (although I expect v4 and
v6 will coexist for a very long time), so why not start using IPv6 now and start
reaping the benefits of IPv6 as soon as possible? While working with IPv6 feels
very foreign at first, one quickly finds that it is just much easier to manage
than IPv4 (using v6, subnetting is trivial, there are plenty of available
addresses in even a
&ldquo;small&rdquo; /96 network, there's no need for NAT, and so on).
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Scott, I think having your VPSes on both IPv4 and IPv6
(for Web sites and such) will be the key to an eventual migration. Unfortunately,
since NATing works so well now, the stress over running out of IPv4 addresses has
lessened. I think we'll see a hybrid world for a very long time.&mdash;Shawn
Powers</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Rob Hooft:</b></span>
</p><p>
I'm in The Netherlands, and I'm using IPv6 where possible. xs4all gave me a
static /48 net, which gives me enough address space to fill my whole house with
400 m3 of sand and address each of the grains individually.
</p><p>
At work, I am trying to convince people that all services should be hosted on
both address spaces, but some hosters really make this unnecessarily
complicated.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>
Rob, keep pushing! Until there's a saturation of services hosted on
parallel address spaces, I don't think the migration will really go
anywhere.&mdash;Shawn Powers</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sander Steffann:</b></span>
</p><p>
I have been using IPv6 for almost ten years now. I was responsible for the
technical department of a small ISP in The Netherlands that I cofounded, and I
implemented IPv6 everywhere as soon as I could. The routers, firewalls, DNS
servers, mail servers and the ISP's own Web servers all have IPv6. I left the
ISP five years ago, and I am now a freelance consultant specializing in IPv6. I
also run my own LISP (RFC6830)-based ISP, which, of course, has full IPv6 support.
I helped several ISPs implement IPv6 in their back-bones, data centers and
access (DSL, fiber) networks, did some IPv6 consultancy for a Dutch bank, and I
am giving regular IPv6 training courses in the Middle East.
</p><p>
What do I do with it? Use the Internet. Seriously&mdash;using IPv6 should be
invisible. It just works, behind the scenes. IPv6 is not something you
consciously use. It is the technology that lets us keep and increase the
flexibility that the Internet gives us today.
</p><p>
IPv4 addresses have run out. The last IPv4 addresses are in the distribution
chain and are being handed out to users. Some parts of the world, like the US,
still have some IPv4 addresses in their Regional Internet Registry (in the US
that is ARIN). They distribute the right to use blocks of IP addresses to ISPs
and companies, until they run out. ARIN is expected to run out approximately
one year from now. In other parts of the world, the RIRs already have run out,
and the last IPv4 addresses are being used by ISPs. Enterprises in those
regions cannot get their own provider-independent IPv4 addresses anymore.
</p><p>
Because of the shortage of IPv4 addresses, it won't be possible to give every
connected subscriber his or her own IPv4 address anymore. IPv4 addresses have to be
shared. That means that connected subscribers lose control over their
Internet connections. Certain applications (mostly VPNs to the office) will not
work properly. Running your own servers for Web, mail and other applications
will become impossible and so forth. For on-line applications (like banking), it will
become almost impossible to distinguish between different subscribers based on
their IPv4 address, so if one subscriber tries to attack the on-line service
they will have no choice but to block all subscribers sharing the same IPv4
address&mdash;and that could be hundreds or thousands of subscribers.
</p><p>
IPv6 provides enough addresses to give all users more than they will ever
need. This sounds like a &ldquo;640K ought to be enough for anybody&rdquo; statement, until
you do the math. Every LAN in IPv6 gets 2<sup  >64</sup> = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616
addresses, and every subscriber gets a block big enough for multiple LANs (in
Europe usually 65,536 subnets per subscriber, sometimes residential subscribers
get only 256 subnets). Using IPv6 means that we don't do
address-sharing tricks; subscribers keep full control over their Internet
connection, and security can be as fine-grained (or even better) than it is
today.
</p><p>
As far as whether my ISP supports it natively, it's as 
native as you can get with LISP.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Sander, you're absolutely correct that using IPv6 should be
seamless. I think we're at the place now that IPv6 should be provided to everyone
by all ISPs, so that the transition/migration can happen. I hope that is
soon!&mdash;Shawn Powers</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Anonymous:</b></span>
</p><p>
My ISP is Internode in Australia, and it offers a /64 static IPv6 natively.
Obviously, I use it whenever a server I connect to offers an IPv6 address.
My VPS provider (Reliable Hosting) and dedicated server provider (Wholesale
Internet, Inc.) both offer IPv6 on their servers.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Jonathan Guthrie:</b></span>
</p><p>
I've had my networks on IPv6 for a long time now, as my original tunnel to the
6bone was over my Sprint T1&mdash;that was like 15 years ago. I originally connected
to the 6bone to learn how this IPv6 stuff worked, and I'm still waiting for the
rest of the world to figure out it's useful. My tunnel now is through he.net,
because it's the best solution I could find. (I have Comcast business-class as
my provider now, and it swears that it'll roll out native IPv6 &ldquo;real
soon now&rdquo;.)
My VPS provider was chosen specifically because it offered native IPv6,
among other criteria.
</p><p>
What I do with it is, well, stuff. All my computers have IPv6 addresses, and I
SSH to and from them, do Web stuff and whatnot. Mr Graber's experience
notwithstanding [see below], there seems to be a vanishingly small number of sites that are
available over IPv6 and a vanishingly small number of people using IPv6, most
of which (at least in my Apache logs) appear to be running Mac OS X. The last
time I looked, about a year ago, I was getting about one IPv6 connection every
other month, while my normal traffic is maybe 200&ndash;300 IPv4
connections a day (that's after filtering out my home addresses, of course).
</p><p>
Perhaps answering this survey will change that. Perhaps not. I'll keep an eye
on my logs.
</p><p>
One thing that I find interesting is that my Verizon 4G service is often IPv6.
When the 4G works, that is.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
I have a similar business account with an ISP, and I'm expecting
IPv6 &ldquo;real soon now&rdquo; too. I didn't know about Verizon 4G/IPv6&mdash;that's
fascinating!&mdash;Shawn Powers</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Peter Nunn:</b></span>
</p><p>
I'm using it at my home office, and my ISP, Internode, is one of the very few
in oz to offer it natively.
</p><p>
I intend to use it to access my servers running in my network from outside, but
I have to say that so far I've struggled to find an IPv6 connection anywhere
else even to see if I can get back in.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Aaron Ogle:</b></span>
</p><p>
I use IPv6 to access IPv6 Interwebs. My VPSes have IPv6, so I can set a different
address for each service and so on. Being allocated a /64 and having that many
routable addresses is a no-brainer.
Supposedly IPv6 is coming to crapcast. I have yet to see it.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Kevin Otte:</b></span>
</p><p>
I have an ASUS N66R router that has firmware based on DD-WRT. I have a
Hurricane Electric IPv6 tunnel set up through it. It's very handy to be able to have
a publicly accessible IPv6 address for every device. I am having to beef up on
iptables in my firewall box though.
</p><p>
My home ISP does not yet have IPv6 support. It gave me the &ldquo;We have enough
IPv4, so we don't care&rdquo; line. This made me sad. My VPS provider does offer
IPv6, which has come in very handy for VPN access from places that don't.
</p><p>
I am testing the IPv6 on everything I can get my hands on&mdash;I've got to do it early to
avoid the panic when IPv4 fully exhausts and the laggards finally freak out.
</p><p>
My main focus of late has been trying to get the word out. Here's a little bit about
those efforts:

</p><p>
I share in the disappointment that LJ.com isn't reachable over IPv6. I see
from the BGP announcements that the data center is advertising a v6 prefix.
Perhaps y'all would like a hand?
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Although many of us are sysadmins in our day jobs, the magazine and
Web site are clients in the hosting world along with every other business. It will
be pretty cool if we can work with our hosting provider(s) to get native IPv6
going, but as you note, we haven't started that process yet.&mdash;Shawn Powers</em></span>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Thomas Schafer:</b></span>
</p><p>
I am using IPv6 to have Internet. As far as whether my ISP supports it natively,
it depends on the situation.
At work, yes&mdash;Leibniz Supercomputing Centre supports native IPv6.
At home, in theory, the Deutsche Telekom could give IPv6 addresses, but in
practice, I
am still forced to use a tunnel broker.
On the way: I am a lucky UMTS/IPV6-tester&mdash;native IPv6 (with NAT64).
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Stephane Graber:</b></span>
</p><p>
Not too surprisingly as the networking guy for Ubuntu, I've been using IPv6 for
years now.
My home ISP (teksavvy) supports it natively. I have separate IPv4 and IPv6
PPP sessions with a /29 IPv4 subnet and a /56 IPv6 subnet statically assigned
to me.
</p><p>
During a normal month, IPv6 typically represents 75% of my traffic (around
800GB), although that's mostly explained because of backups of other IPv6-capable
machines and because of Google who's been supporting IPv6 on all its services
for a while now.
</p><p>
I've occasionally had issues with my IPv4 connectivity ending up in a few hours
of surfing in the IPv6-only world, which is surprisingly usable so long as you
mostly use Google, Wikipedia and things like the Debian servers that are all
dual-stack.
</p><p>
I also have native IPv6 for my hosted server in Germany (hetzner), so all my
server services are dual-stack.
</p><p>
For some other networks I managed (family setup) where native IPv6 isn't
available yet, I'm using HE.net IPv6 tunnels. Those are very reliable, free and
often provide a shorter (number of hops and latency) path between two hosts
than going through the standard IPv4 route.
</p><p>
So in short, I've got IPv6 everywhere and try to make sure I never put
something new on-line that's not IPv6-capable and that I port or retire anything
that's already on-line and that's IPv4-only.
</p><p>
There are a few things that people will need to get used to to get good IPv6
connectivity though, like making sure ICMP packets aren't blocked in or out and
that the MTU/PMTU is set properly on all machines. But that's really where most
of the pain has been for me. The rest tends to just work.
Now it's just a matter of waiting for the rest of the world to catch up!
</p><p>
PS: When will we have <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a> on IPv6?
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Stephane, it's awesome to hear how much you're able to use IPv6 on
a daily basis! Hopefully we'll be able to get our Web site on IPv6 soon. We'll be
an interesting litmus test, as <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is staffed by brilliant folks, but
is hosted just like any other company. Once it's easy for a nerdy company like us
to provide IPv6 connectivity, other companies should be able to follow fairly
quickly!

I've been a longtime user of IPv6 via Hurricane Electric's TunnelBroker.net. I
use multiple subnets (from a /48) for my internal networks. Unfortunately, my
ISP (Suddenlink) is still in the testing phase and has not yet rolled out
native dual-stack. My previous ISP (Comcast) supported IPv6 natively, and it
was enjoyable.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
