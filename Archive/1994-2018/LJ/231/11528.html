When our house was built a few years ago (after our house fire), one of the
things I wanted was a house wired for Ethernet connectivity. Unfortunately, the
contractor must not have realized that running CAT5e isn't the same as running
power lines. Although my house did in fact have RJ-45 jacks in a few rooms, opening
the wall panel exposed approximately three inches of untwisted wire crammed into the
wall jack. Even worse, they stapled, yes <span   class="emphasis"><em>stapled</em></span>, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>CAT3</em></span> cable to the wall
studs. 
</p><p>
When asked about the CAT3 wiring, mess of untwisted wire and stapling, the
contractor assured me that CAT3 and CAT5e are the exact same thing, and that he'd been
installing Ethernet cable for longer than I've been alive. Although it was
flattering that he must have assumed I was born after 1990, I decided it wasn't a
battle worth fighting. I've since run Ethernet cabling throughout my house, and
terminated it properly. Thankfully, while this issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> is focused
on networking, all the articles are written by experts, and none of them are
stapled to the wall.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner starts things off with a bit of Clojure. Although that may sound like a
counterintuitive way to start an issue, in this case, Clojure is a way to make Web
applications. It's a modern variant of Lisp, and whether you love or hate Lisp,
it's worth checking out Clojure. And, Dave Taylor provides us with a real bit of closure
this month, as he finishes his series on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span>. Whether you love the game, or
just love the scripting process, it's been an educational series.
</p><p>
We get launched directly into the networking issue with Kyle Rankin's Hack and / column.
Kyle starts a series on DNSSEC, which adds a much-needed layer of security to
DNS. In a perfect world, DNSSEC would be unnecessary, but unfortunately, we don't
live in a perfect world. I follow Kyle with my Open-Source Classroom column. If
you've never been faced with deploying WAR files, or haven't ever needed to
install any Java applications, Tomcat might be confusing and foreign to you. I
hope to clear some of that up this month with a primer on deploying Java on your
server.
</p><p>
We dive in to hard-core networking next with Igor Partola's article on IPv6
tunnel brokers. If you participated in the IPv6 poll, you might be interested in
setting up IPv6, and Igor explains how to do that, whether your ISP supports it or
not. Speaking of ISPs, Dan Siemon shows how to look at network latency as
opposed to bandwidth for measuring network performance. ISPs offer higher and
higher bandwidth, but network engineers (and on-line gamers) know that there's
more to the network than just speed. Dan describes how to deal with latency in our
Linux systems.
</p><p>
Next, Michal Ludvig takes us on a trip to his Pacific island, where bandwidth comes
either slow and expensive, or fast and insanely expensive. Thankfully with Linux,
he can do some advanced routing to leverage multiple ISPs for maximum savings. If
you need to load balance WAN connections, or if you just want to utilize your
multiple connections better, Michal's article will be extremely useful.
</p><p>
Bill Childers is back this month with his review of the Samsung ARM-based
Chromebook. I just bought the same model notebook, and I learned a lot from Bill's
article. I wasn't sure if I'd love or hate a Chromebook, but Bill shows how to
do a little more than Google intended. It's pretty awesome. Doc Searls
finishes our issue off with a look at television. Are we approaching a major
departure from TV as we know it? Looking at my house with its XBMC devices,
Internet TV and streaming-only entertainment, I'd say yes. Doc agrees, and he goes
into detail on what's to come.
</p><p>
I have a passion for networking, and this issue really piques my interest. 
It's hard to
pick up the networking issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> and not learn
something, but if
nothing else, hopefully you've learned never to have a contractor install your
Ethernet cabling&mdash;unless your contractor has a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> bumper sticker.
Then he or she might be okay!
