Gumstix Inc.'s Overo and DuoVero COMs</h2></div></div><p>
Gumstix Inc. is encouraging embedded designers seeking a speedier way to bring
advanced products to market to explore two newly upgraded computers-on-modules
(COMs): the DuoVero Zephyr and the Overo TidalSTORM. The DuoVero COM now
features wireless functionality on the Zephyr product series by way of a Wi2Wi
module for 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The DuoVero is based on the Texas
Instruments OMAP4430 and gives electronic designers the same core technology that
powers today's smartphones, tablets and other media-rich mobile devices.
Meanwhile, the new TidalSTORM COM upgrades the Overo series to 1GB of RAM&mdash;twice the
memory enables significantly better performance and results in an effective Linux
graphical device. Rounding out the upgrade is the DaVinci Digital Video
processor, which provides enhanced capabilities for memory-intensive graphics
applications.

CloudAccess's CloudIDM/AM</h2></div></div><p>
The new developments in the CloudIDM/AM solution by CloudAccess are intended to
help IT administration regain and maintain control of every single user's unique
relationship to the IT environment. CloudIDM/AM's function is to provide seamless
integration between enterprise identity management and access control (single
sign-on/access management) from the cloud. In this new release, CloudAccess has
taken the next evolutionary step to integrate the key capabilities of
provisioning, multifactor authentication and role-based workflow management with
an advanced single sign-on for SaaS and legacy applications&mdash;and manage it all
from the cloud. New so-called &ldquo;game-changing&rdquo; developments include
multi-directional password synchronization between the identity management
solution, Active Directory and/or LDAP, a federated gateway to control access to
any application or Web site, dynamic self-service portal and centralized
GUI-based workflow automation. CloudAccess says that its solution currently is
the only product on the market that presents these features from a multi-tenant
cloud.

Amy Lupold Bair's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Raising Digital Families For Dummies</em></span> (Wiley)</h2></div></div><p>
Go ahead, overlook the technical content in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Raising Digital Families
For Dummies</em></span>
by Amy Lupold Bair, because it's Computing 101. What tech-savvy parent couldn't
use the Dr Phil-like parenting advice contained in its pages? Although most
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers had PCs as youngsters&mdash;TI-99/4As, Commodore 64s and the
like&mdash;this youngest generation never will know life without smartphones,
Facebook and today's &ldquo;always-connected&rdquo; lifestyle. Bair's book is an
easy-to-understand guide that helps parents get up to speed on everything they
need to know in order to manage their children's on-line and gadget activity. The
book offers guidance for managing mobile devices, social media and the Internet
before it manages you! Also featured are tips and advice for establishing family
rules for technology use and how to best handle situations when rules are broken.
Other topics include monitoring software for computers and mobile devices, advice
for handling cyberbullies, safe social networks for children, a guide to blogging
and podcasting and useful on-line resources.

Open-E Data Storage Software</h2></div></div><p>
The Open-E Data Storage Software (DSS), now a more feature-rich v7, is a
Linux-based data storage software used for building and managing centralized data
storage servers&mdash;NAS and SAN. Open-E's philosophy with DSS is to offer an
all-in-one universal storage system that allows businesses of all sizes to turn
any commodity server into an enterprise data-storage appliance for their big
data, cloud and other enterprise applications. This new DSS v7 adds Hyper-V
Cluster support for Windows Server 2008 R2 and 2012, which provides optimization
of virtual storage environments, thus enabling customers to set up a virtualized
storage environment with no single point of failure. This support adds to DSS's
Active-Active Failover for iSCSI Volumes feature, which offers a self-validation
functionality that checks all critical settings on each node, provides enhanced
cluster security and fully utilizes all processing power of the data storage
servers.

Logic Supply's LGX MK100 1U Rackmount Case</h2></div></div><p>
Specialized systems provider Logic Supply refers to its new MK100 1U Rackmount
Case as &ldquo;the most versatile 1U rackmount case we've seen&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the last 1U
rackmount case you'll ever need&rdquo;. Designed by LGX Systems, Logic
Supply's engineering arm, the MK100 case offers mounting flexibility, world power
compatibility and customizable faceplate options. The MK100 is constructed of
high-quality, nickel-plated steel that protects against electromagnetic and radio
frequency interference. To enhance longevity, the case comes equipped with dual
long-life MagLev fans that provide plenty of airflow across even high-power Core
i solutions. LGX's own fan mufflers ensure quiet operation and optimize airflow
while also improving reliability by reducing strain on the fans. These features
are a part of MK100's modular design, which allows for easy customization,
with standard faceplate options including any combination of the following: four
2.5" drive hot-swap bays, an LCD panel with multifunction buttons and a
slimline optical drive.

Red Hat's GlusterFS</h2></div></div><p>
Our sources at Red Hat informed us of an update to GlusterFS, the open-source,
distributed filesystem capable of scaling to several petabytes (or 72
brontobytes, to be exact) while handling thousands of clients. The new GlusterFS
3.4 release adds features and enhancements in cloud, virtualization and
performance to the filesystem's existing high reliability, scalability and data
mobility for users and application developers. New capabilities include QEMU
integration with libgfapi, performance improvements for VM image storage for KVM,
oVirt virtualization management GUI support, support for SSL-based encryption of
&ldquo;in-flight&rdquo; data, multithreaded glusterd for better performance and
NFSv3 ACL support, among others.

Tom Stuart's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Understanding Computation</em></span> (O'Reilly)</h2></div></div><p>
Programmers with little or no formal training in computer science who want to
understand computation theory and programming language design can crack open
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Understanding Computation</em></span> by Tom Stuart. In his book, Stuart tackles
theoretical computer science in an engaging, practical way and in a context
programmers will recognize, helping them to appreciate why these ideas matter and
how they can inform one's day-to-day programming. Rather than use mathematical
notation or an unfamiliar academic programming language like Haskell or Lisp,
this book uses Ruby in a reductionist manner to present formal semantics,
automata theory and functional programming with the lambda calculus. Also
included is an exploration of the universal Turing machines that led to
today's general-purpose computers.

Linux Professional Institute's Jobs Initiative</h2></div></div><p>
Think of Linux Professional Institute's (LPI's) Jobs Initiative on oDesk as a
&ldquo;SaaS for job seekers&rdquo;. LPI is a well-known Linux certification
organization; oDesk is a well-known on-line marketplace for contract employment. The
goal of this workforce development initiative is to help Linux and open-source
professionals connect with work opportunities via oDesk, a process that is aided
by the opportunity for LPI-certified professionals to display their badges on
their oDesk profiles. LPI notes that oDesk originally approached LPI after
seeing growth in demand for certified Linux and open-source professionals. The
initiative allows for free registration of LPI alumni in various groups
corresponding to specific certification levels LPIC-1, LPIC-2 and LPIC-3, which
enables businesses to hire IT professionals by level of LPI certification. LPI
alumni who register and work on oDesk also will benefit from a payment guarantee
on hourly jobs.
