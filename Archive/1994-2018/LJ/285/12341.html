  <h1 class="title">Oracle Patches Spectre for Red Hat</h1>

  <h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Red Hat's Spectre remediation currently requires new microcode for a complete fix, which leaves most x86 processors vulnerable as they lack this update. Oracle has released new retpoline kernels that completely remediate Meltdown and Spectre on all compatible CPUs, which I show how to install and test on CentOS here. By Charles Fisher</h2>

  <p>The Red Hat community has patiently awaited a retpoline kernel implementation that remediates CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre v2) and closes all Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities that have captured headlines this year.</p>

  <p>Red Hat's initial fixes rely upon microcode updates for v2 remediation, a decision that leaves the vast majority of AMD64-capable processors in an exploitable state. Intel's new microcode has proven especially problematic; it performs badly and the January 2018 versions were plagued with stability issues that crashed many systems. It is a poor solution to a pressing problem.</p>

  <p>Google's retpolines—an <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/01/more-details-about-mitigations-for-cpu_4.html">ingenious</a> approach to v2—essentially play out the exploit within the Linux kernel in any and all vulnerable code. This method allows the kernel to retain complete control over speculative execution hardware in all architectures upon which it runs. It is faster and more generic than Intel's microcode and seems in every way a superior solution.</p>

  <p>Oracle appears to be the first major member of the Red Hat community that has delivered a Linux kernel with retpoline support. The latest version of the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel preview release 5 (UEKr5) now offers complete remediation for Meltdown and Spectre regardless of CPU microcode status. The UEKr5 is based on the mainline Linux kernel's long-term support branch v4.14 release. <strong><em>In late-breaking news, Oracle has issued a production release of the UEKr4 that also includes retpolines, details below.</em></strong> For corporate users and others with mandated patch schedules over a large number of servers, the UEK now seems to be the only solution for complete Spectre coverage on all CPUs. The UEK brings a number of other advantages over the "Red Hat-Compatible Kernel" (RHCK), but this patch response is likely to drive Oracle deeply into the Red Hat community should they remain the single source.</p>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">CentOS Installation</h3>

  <p><a href="https://www.centos.org">CentOS</a>, <a href="https://www.scientificlinux.org">Scientific</a> and <a href="https://linux.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=101:101:2470398880366:::::">Oracle</a> Linux are all based off the upstream provider Red Hat. CentOS is a popular variant and is likely the best demonstration for loading the UEK on a peer distro.</p>

  <p>It appears that Red Hat itself has been laying groundwork for a retpoline kernel. A January 2018 gcc compiler update implies a successful backport:</p>
  <pre><code>
# rpm -q --changelog gcc | head -2
* Wed Jan 24 2018 Jeff Law ... 4.8.5-16.2
- retpoline support for spectre mitigation (#1538487)
</code>
</pre>

  <p>Oracle announced a yum repository for the UEKr5 on February 25, 2018. There are <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/upgrade-to-the-uek-r5-preview-on-oracle-cloud-infrastructure">detailed instructions</a> for users of Oracle Linux to add this repo, but the installation procedure on CentOS is slightly different. Alternately, the RPMs can be <a href="http://yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL7/developer_UEKR5/x86_64">manually downloaded</a> and installed from the repository. Below I describe proceeding with the yum repo.</p>

  <p>First, define the repo for yum with the exact contents that are found in Oracle's installation instructions:</p>
  <pre><code>
echo '[ol7_developer_UEKR5]
name=Oracle Linux $releasever UEK5 Development Packages 
 ↪($basearch)
baseurl=http://yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL7/
↪developer_UEKR5/$basearch/
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-oracle
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1' &gt; /etc/yum.repos.d/public-yum-ol7_uek.repo
</code>
</pre>

  <p>Note that the GPG entry above will not normally exist on CentOS. If you want to install it, the contents of the file must be:</p>
  <pre><code>

  <p>The yum repo entry for the UEKr4 is below:</p>

$releasever ($basearch)
baseurl=http://yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL7/UEKR4/$basearch/

  <p>The UEK is a popular choice in enterprise Linux, and it brings many new features to RPM distributions. It is the easiest and most stable method to implement a v4 performance-tuned kernel in a supported manner on a Red Hat-derivative OS (which usually runs v3.10 at best).</p>

  <p>The UEK is especially notable as it works with Ksplice (as does Oracle's RHCK), which allows for online kernel patches and upgrades without rebooting, and Ksplice can even extend this ability to select userland libraries (glibc and OpenSSL). This service is offered for free to Fedora and Ubuntu users, and as a paid support option for both CentOS (after a scripted conversion to Oracle Linux) and Red Hat. Ksplice is the oldest and most mature high-availability option for Linux security upgrades.</p>

  <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Conclusion</h3>

  <p>While the UEKr5 remains in preview release status, it is likely not appropriate to use it on critical production servers. The UEKr4 is now a production option for those who require immediate remediation. Users on peer distributions should certainly begin testing the UEKr5 now if their timetables permit. Those with critical systems should consider commercial (paid) support, and potentially implement Ksplice for high availability.</p>

  <p>Many customers of peer distros would likely prefer to keep their systems "pure" from a single supplier. Still, the community has long been making use of <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">EPEL</a>, <a href="http://elrepo.org/tiki/tiki-index.php">ElRepo</a>, <a href="https://li.nux.ro/repos.html">Nux</a> and others. Oracle simply offers another repository with useful packages. The EPEL maintainer Fedora was launched as an organization by Red Hat; administrators who forbid third-party yum repositories likely do not understand the historical relationships between these organizations.</p>

  <p>There is also occasional hostile sentiment toward Oracle for various reasons. Still, Oracle remains an important contributor to the Linux community, and its software meets the needs of a large base of customers. Quality software with useful features should not be rejected because of organizational bias.</p>

  <p>In any case, this is a major accomplishment for Oracle Linux, and all members of the Red Hat community stand to benefit from these efforts regardless of their level of participation. It is unlikely that Oracle will forever maintain the technical advantages discussed here, but it has earned and deserve accolades for these advances.</p>
