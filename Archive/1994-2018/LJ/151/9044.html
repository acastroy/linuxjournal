How to set up the DansGuardian content filter with the lightweight
Tinyproxy.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x266d580.0x2765298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Microsoft users continue to adopt the Linux operating system and naturally
expect to find content filters like the ones they used with Windows
XP.  Often, new Linux converts experiment on their standalone personal
computers at home.  Because many people object to some information and images
readily found on the Internet, a content filtering system is top
priority&mdash;especially because parents often share computers with
kids, and constant
adult supervision is not always possible.
</p><p>
Using DansGuardian with Tinyproxy is one way parents can supervise
Internet content when they are away from the family computer.
A versatile content filter, DansGuardian is open-source software for
use in a noncommercial setting.  If you want to use DansGuardian in a
commercial setting, you can buy a license or buy SmoothGuardian.  Working
with DansGuardian is Tinyproxy, a small open-source program that
understands
and evaluates the information passing through the computer.  Together
they provide administrative controls to block objectionable content from
the Internet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x266d580.0x27653f8"></a>
Content Filtering at 5,000 Feet</h2></div></div><p>
DansGuardian is a collection of pass-through filters used to stop
Internet Web pages with words, phrases and pictures you don't like or want
others to see.  The filters within DansGuardian act as an intermediary
program between a client browser, like Firefox, and the Internet.  Firefox
makes the information request to DansGuardian.  Then, DansGuardian passes
the information to Tinyproxy, which communicates with the Internet.
</p><p>
Information coming back from the Internet passes through Tinyproxy
and DansGuardian before it gets to the client browser.  Only approved
information gets through the filter and appears in the browser
window.  DansGuardian blocks restricted Web pages and replaces the
unwanted content with an &ldquo;access denied&rdquo; security screen displayed in the
browser window.
</p><p>
This has not been a high-level description of the filtering procedure.
In fact, the way Tinyproxy and DansGuardian work together is complex
and interesting.  If you want to explore how this works, check out the
DansGuardian &ldquo;Flow of Events&rdquo; page (see the on-line
Resources).  Here, you can find a more thorough
discussion of filtering and how data passes between each program and
the Internet.
</p><p>
What's important to know is you can define many words, phrases and
specific locations you want DansGuardian to block.  In addition to
Web pages with text, DansGuardian also can filter pictures and prevent
the downloading of certain files.  This combination of filtering is superior
to other methods that block access only to a list of banned sites.
</p><p>
With more than 20 different configuration files, setup of DansGuardian
can appear complicated to new Linux users.  However, the configuration
files contain clear instructions on how to edit them for your needs.
In my tests, I didn't need to make a lot of changes, because the default
filtering arrangement is almost ideal for family use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x266d580.0x2765710"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
First, you need
to install and configure DansGuardian and Tinyproxy.  Second, it's
important to adjust your desktop settings to prevent users from easily
turning off content filtering.
</p><p>
Before installing, look through the package repository of
your distribution to make sure it includes DansGuardian and Tinyproxy.
The most simple way to install the programs is with a GUI package manager
like Novel SUSE's YaST or Synaptic.  For Debian, root users enter
<tt  >apt-get
install dansguardian tinyproxy</tt>.
</p><p>
If you don't have these applications in your
package repository, you can download DansGuardian and Tinyproxy from
their respective Web pages (see Resources).  After downloading, you will find
generic installation instructions in the file named INSTALL.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x266d580.0x2765920"></a>
Configuring DansGuardian and Tinyproxy</h2></div></div><p>
The next task is to customize configuration files for both Tinyproxy
and DansGuardian.  I use Ubuntu Dapper Drake for testing purposes, and
so the directory and file illustrations are likely specific to this
distribution.  Other distributions organize files in a similar way; you
just may need to look a little more to find the installation directory.
For customizing features, the only tool necessary is a simple text
editor, such as GNOME's gedit.
</p><p>
Using your text editor, as root user, open
/etc/dansguardian/dansguardian.conf.  Review the file and change
filterport, proxyip and proxyport to match that shown below.  Depending on your
distribution, it also may be necessary to comment out the line starting
with UNCONFIGURED:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# the port that DansGuardian listens to.
filterport = 8080

# the ip of the proxy&mdash;default is the loopback (this server)
proxyip = 127.0.0.1

# the port DansGuardian connects to proxy on
proxyport = 3128
</pre>
</p><p>
DansGuardian generally connects to port 3128 by default, because that
is the port used by the popular proxy called Squid.  We can change this
to the default port used by Tinyproxy (8888), or we can change the
Tinyproxy port.  In this case, we do the latter and change the
port Tinyproxy uses to match the default Squid port.
</p><p>
For Tinyproxy, edit the file /etc/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.conf as root
user.  Look through this file, and make sure to change User, Group, Port and
ViaProxyName, if necessary.  The important thing to change is the port that
Tinyproxy will use to match the DansGuardian connect port, which is 3128:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# Port to listen on.
#
Port 3128
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you've finished with these changes, issue the command
<tt  >tinyproxy</tt>
in your terminal, or if Ubuntu-based, type <tt  >sudo /etc/init.d/tinyproxy
start</tt>.  This starts the proxy, and you're now ready to finish off
the installation by adjusting your browser preferences.  If you
want to learn more, look at the DansGuardian documentation links (see
Resources) for a description of this
process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x266d580.0x2765ce8"></a>
Adjust Your Browser Settings</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu comes with Firefox as the preferred client browser, so the
instructions here are specific to Firefox.  Other client browsers will
likely have similar capabilities and documentation to show how to mimic
these instructions.
</p><p>
This last installation step points the browser at port 8080, so it
sends data only through DansGuardian and Tinyproxy.  With Firefox, go to
Edit&rarr;Preferences&rarr;General tab&rarr;Connection Settings to see
the screen shown in
Figure 1.  As shown, select manual proxy configuration, enter localhost and
port 8080.  This assumes you are going to install and use DansGuardian and
Tinyproxy on every workstation.  If you set up DansGuardian and Tinyproxy
on a separate server, then you need to enter the name or IP address of
the server machine that runs DansGuardian and Tinyproxy instead of the
word localhost in the HTTP Proxy: line.

Figure 1. Set up your browser to use the proxy.
</p></div></div><p>
Restart your browser and test how well the filter works.
</p><p>
When testing the new filter, you should see an access denied screen
similar to the one shown in Figure 2. Before going any further, it's a good
idea to look for problems you may find with the default filter settings.
For example, I often download .tar and other executable files. The default
configuration file stops these files from download. To fix this problem,
you need to edit the bannedextensionlist.txt file, and place a #
to comment out the file extensions you want to let through the filter.

Figure 2. A Typical DansGuardian Access Denied Page
</p></div></div><p>
To be thorough, you should look through all default configuration .txt
files with DansGuardian to tailor how you want the filters to react.
You won't know all the situations you'll run into at first, but this
is a good opportunity to gain an understanding of this application's
powerful features.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x266d580.0x27662c0"></a>
Some Vulnerabilities</h2></div></div><p>
No system is perfect, and there are several obvious ways to defeat
DansGuardian and Tinyproxy.  The most noteworthy is how easily users
can bypass the proxy and filters.  Without further protection, a user can
restore Firefox's preferences back to Direct Connection, which bypasses
DansGuardian and Tinyproxy.  Once reversed, users have unrestricted
access to the Internet.
</p><p>
However, there are more ways to secure the DansGuardian filters further by
forcing all communication with the Internet through port 8080.  A link on
the DansGuardian documentation Web page explains a well-thought-out method
of using FireHol to force this condition on all Internet thoroughfares
(see Resources).
</p><p>
For the novice user, an easier approach is to set up a filtering plan
that includes restricted user privileges, locked browser preferences
and making sure the proxy filters start each time the computer reboots.
</p><p>
For test purposes, I created a new user account on Ubuntu Dapper Drake
(Figure 3).  Using the checklist features, I severely limited the capability
of the user test.  Although these privileges could be just right for
anyone who has no computer experience or who is plainly not trustworthy.
Utilities like update-rc.d and fcconf define certain programs
to start at the system boot.  I used a bootup manager called BUM
to make DansGuardian and Tinyproxy start at each boot.

Figure 4. Set up DansGuardian and Tinyproxy to run every time you boot
Linux.
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, I decided to lock down the preferences of Firefox.
Restricting Firefox's preferences is not as difficult as
it may sound.  An older copyrighted article titled &ldquo;HOWTO
Lock Down Mozilla Preferences for LTSP&rdquo; by Warren Togami (see
Resources)
describes how to carry this out in great detail.  Although, I didn't
want to mess with byte shift coding to achieve similar results.
</p><p>
After rummaging through Mozilla.org's Web site, I chose to add lockPref
statements to my Firefox configuration file to keep users from changing
connection settings.  I edited the file /usr/lib/firefox/firefox.cfg
to appear as the one shown in Figure 5.  The last three lines force a manual proxy
selection on localhost, port 8080.  After saving this file and restarting
Firefox, you can't reset the connection settings.  Further, other users
without administrative privileges could not quickly change the settings
and bypass the filters.

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x266d580.0x2766b00"></a>
Maintenance</h2></div></div><p>
After customizing the filters to your liking, it's important to realize
that
some settings become stale.  Blacklisted sites and new phrases
are likely to go out of date sooner than others.  New Web sites
you will want to block come on-line often, and new word combinations
can make past phrases obsolete.  Looking through the Extras link on the
DansGuardian site, you will find more
information on blacklists.  In addition, several users have contributed
scripts to automate blacklist generation and update.
</p><p>
As an alternative, URLblacklist.com allows
new users to download their first file free.  Afterwards, you can sign
up for a periodic subscription for access to the latest-and-greatest
information.  Instructions for applying the new data for DansGuardian
are on the Web site.
</p><p>
Another consideration is whether the proxy and filter will slow down
Internet surfing and page loading.  Some users will suffer a small impact
on Web surfing performance when using Tinyproxy.  In my own testing, I
noticed a slight delay, plus a couple of issues with my browser
cache.  Clearing the Firefox cache with Ctrl-Shift-Del fixed the cache
problems right away.  Occasionally, it has been necessary to restart
Tinyproxy, After doing so, my Internet performance improved.  Although annoying
at times, these small issues are acceptable trade-offs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x266d580.0x2766cb8"></a>
Log File Review</h2></div></div><p>
Both DansGuardian and Tinyproxy make log files for administrators to
review.  Within /var/log, you should find directories for DansGuardian
and Tinyproxy.  Using an editor, open the files and search through the
data to find out what's been happening on the computer.  Sequentially
stored data and clear comment fields make the file easier to understand.
For DansGuardian, there is a user-contributed add-on script for searching
and displaying the results in a more user-friendly format.
</p><p>
One feature not found in DansGuardian is the capacity to e-mail the log
files to a third party for review.  This can be a real deterrent for some
people if they know they have an accountability partner watching their
actions on the Internet.

Some Final Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>
Before settling on this solution for content filtering, consider what
your overall requirements are in the upcoming months.  If you have only one
computer to deal with and you don't mind tinkering with configuration
files, DansGuardian is probably a good choice.  Alternatively,
SmoothGuardian looks like a great buy for $90 US.  Plus, the software
includes a user-friendly Web-based interface and nontechnical
installation.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, setup of DansGuardian and Tinyproxy is well within the
scope of new Linux users, and the free price fits most budgets nicely.
Using this article and its references as a guide, you shouldn't have too
much difficulty getting up and running.  Even if you do battle a few
problems, using Google to search for answers is easy.  Plus, there is
also a Web content filtering portal linked to the DansGuardian home page
(see Resources) and an IRC chat location.
</p><p>
Overall, DansGuardian and Tinyproxy are frontrunners in the Open Source world and help ease the transition from the Microsoft Windows
environment.  I think you'll find flexible filtering and lightweight proxy
overhead make this a good combination for small networking environments.
