Shrinkwrapped audio gear too expensive? Too inflexible? Perhaps not
geeky enough? Why not use a Linux box as the main workhorse in your
studio?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x13222f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Whether you're into Metal, Jazz, Noise, Baroque or something in between,
it is becoming more and more popular for artists to take on not only
the roles of composer and performer, but also the roles of audio engineer,
producer and even distributor of their own work.
</p><p>
The capability and quality of Linux audio applications are very good
and constantly improving.  Support for high-end and low-end audio cards
is also getting better all the time.  Whether it becomes the dominant
platform in the field is largely irrelevant&mdash;those of us who
find the flexibility of Linux and open-source tools to be valuable now
have a platform suitable for creating high-quality audio tracks.
</p><p>
This article outlines a simple method, which may be built upon, for
recording layered, multitrack recordings.  In keeping with the Linux
tradition, in this article, we discuss a number of small, command-line tools that
perform very specific tasks very well.  We then combine the power of
each of these tools into a digital audio workstation.  As you will see,
using these tools in such a way, it is possible to overcome the (rare)
shortcomings in some of these tools.
</p><p>
The tools we cover here are Ecasound and JACK.  The
Hydrogen drum machine is mentioned briefly too.  We use no ALSA- or
OSS-specific features directly, and either will do fine.  In
fact, for those who have lost their way and have strayed from the path
to enlightenment (kidding), these tools and techniques also work under
CoreAudio on Mac OS X.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows how data flows between each of these components at
a high level.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8781f1.large.jpg"><img src="8781f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Equipment list</h2></div></div><p>
For the examples outlined in this article, any sound card will do.  I
even have performed some relatively acceptable recordings using the
onboard Intel i8x0 sound device in one of my Linux laptops.  However,
the difference between lower-end audio controllers and the mid- to high-end ones is quite noticeable.
</p><p>
We also require a Linux distribution.  If you have trouble
getting JACK and Ecasound for your distribution, try the AGNULA live
distribution.  Most distributions come with the relevant packages these
days anyway.
</p><p>
A mixer is desirable.  Using a small (read: cheap) mixer may give you
more flexibility and a chance at better sound.  You also may find that
a direct injection box or a microphone preamp is adequate.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8781f2.large.jpg"><img src="8781f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Equipment Signal Flow
</p></div></div><p>
Note that Figure 2 suggests plugging the headphones in to your
Linux box.  Most mixers allow the sound card to be plugged in to a
signal return port and allow the headphones to receive the audio signal
either before or after the signal is sent to the Linux box.  This is
acceptable too.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x1322ad8"></a>
Assumed Knowledge</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, we don't assume much, apart from needing the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A Linux box with a configured and tested audio controller.
</p></li><li><p>
The ability to source and install necessary packages and their
dependencies.
</p></li><li><p>
A familiarity with your choice of noise-making device (for example, guitar, cello,
cat and so on).
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x1322e48"></a>
Starting jackd</h2></div></div><p>
JACK, which stands for the JACK Audio Connection Kit, is an API and
a service that provides audio connectivity between applications on
many POSIX-compliant systems.  JACK has been designed with low-latency
communication in mind.
</p><p>
Many of the examples in this article may work equally well without
JACK.  I personally have had fewer audio dropouts on systems employing
JACK running with real-time priority than without, and it is quite useful
for interconnecting audio applications, such as the Ecasound and Hydrogen
examples discussed later.
</p><p>
For applications to make use of JACK, they must be linked against
the JACK API libraries, and the JACK service, called jackd, must
be started.  Distributions shipped with JACK often already have most
applications linked against the JACK API.  If not, consult the build or
compile instructions for your given application.
</p><p>
To start the JACK service, execute a command similar to the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
jackd -R -d alsa
</pre>
</p><p>
The -R option instructs JACK to attempt to attain real-time privilege,
and -d alsa instructs JACK to use the ALSA sound system.  For
users still using the OSS sound system, -d oss should suffice, and
-d coreaudio should get Mac OS X users off to a start.
</p><p>
Each driver supports a series of driver-specific options.  These may be
viewed by specifying --help after -d alsa.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x1323160"></a>
Testing Audio Signal and Setting Levels</h2></div></div><p>
Before leaping in too far and beginning to record audio, I strongly
recommend spending some time getting the various settings and levels
right.  The good news is that this involves plugging the instrument of your
choice in to the mixer or sitting it in front of a microphone and playing.
</p><p>
Begin by getting the average signal coming into the mixer at around the
0VU mark, and try to avoid sending the signal into the red too often.  Once
the mixer levels are generally okay, connect it to your PC and check that
the input level and output level are fine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ecasound -i jack_auto -o null -ev
</pre>
</p><p>
The -i jack_auto command-line option tells Ecasound to get its input
from JACK.  Because we're not running any other JACK-aware applications
at the moment, JACK takes this input from the sound device.  The -o
null tells Ecasound to send output to the great bit bucket in the sky.
</p><p>
The -ev option tells Ecasound to keep track of amplitude statistics, and
the -c option starts Ecasound in interactive mode.  With a little luck,
you should see a few informational messages and no errors or warnings.
</p><p>
Any percussive sounds (such as palm-muting on the guitar) are likely to
cause a spike in your audio track.  While checking the signal levels,
use any of these techniques you intend to record later&mdash;it'll save a
nasty surprise in the moment of creative genius.  To stop, press Ctrl-C.  You
should be presented with output similar to the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
....
(audiofx) Peak amplitude, period: pos=0.30495 neg=0.26996.
(audiofx) Peak amplitude, all : pos=0.30495 neg=0.26996.
(audiofx) Clipped samples, period: pos=0 neg=0.
(audiofx) Clipped samples, all : pos=0 neg=0.
(audiofx) Max gain without clipping, all: 3.27926.
(audiofx) -- End of statistics --------------------------------
</pre>
</p><p>
First, check that you have no clipped samples (positive or
negative).  Second, check the maximum gain figure.  This
gives the percentage that this sample can be amplified (theoretically)
before clipping starts to occur.  Depending on your hardware, you
may never get within a few percentages before you hear audible distortion,
so it pays to leave yourself a little room until you're familiar with
your hardware.  Listen as you test.
</p><p>
Once you have made mixer adjustments, try the previous few steps again.
</p><p>
Once you're happy with the input levels, set the output level to a
comfortable level for you to monitor using your headphones.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x1323580"></a>
Recording a First Track or Live Stereo Performance</h2></div></div><p>
Ecasound is a command-line tool capable of multitrack recording
and more.  The basic concept key to using Ecasound is
chains.  For our purposes, you can consider chains to be similar in function to
a patch lead in a patch bay.  A signal enters one end of the chain from
a sound source and exits the chain into another component.  A patch lead
has exactly one input source and one output destination, and the same
can be said about Ecasound's chain concept.
</p><p>
Sources and destinations for chains in Ecasound are usually audio files or
audio controllers.  It is quite normal to have a complex set of chains.  The
first track we will record will see Ecasound take audio from the running
JACK instance and write the data back to JACK, as well as keep a copy
in a PCM audio file.  The two chains we need to perform these tasks
are shown in Table 1.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x122a580.0x13236e0"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 1. Chains for Our First Track</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 1. Chains for Our First Track8781t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Chain</th><th>Input Source</th><th>Output Destination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>JACK</td><td>JACK</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>JACK</td><td>track1.wav</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
This equates to the following Ecasound command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ecasound -c -b:64 \
-a:1,2 -i jack_auto \
-a:1 -o jack_auto \
-a:2 -o track1.wav
</pre>
</p><p>
Once Ecasound has initialised,
it prompts you for instructions.  Use the t command to start recording/playing and s to
stop.  If you make a mistake, you can issue a stop (s), the setpos 0
command, and t to start again.  The q command quits when you're
done.  There's no need to issue any kind of command to save the
result&mdash;that happens as you record.
</p><p>
The above command can be broken down into the following functions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
-c: don't start processing immediately, instead enter interactive mode.
</p></li><li><p>
-b:64: set the number of samples buffered to the smallest possible, reducing latency.
</p></li><li><p>
-a:1,2 -i jack_auto: create two chains (1 and 2) and set their input
to come from JACK.
</p></li><li><p>
-a:1 -o jack_auto: set the output of chain 1 to JACK.
</p></li><li><p>
-a:2 -o track1.wav: set the output of chain 2 to track1.wav.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The overall result of this particular example is that chain 2 records
anything coming in through JACK (and therefore probably the sound card)
to track1.wav.  Chain 1 allows you to hear the audio signal as it's
being recorded.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x131ab20"></a>
Overdubbing of Subsequent Tracks</h2></div></div><p>
Unless you're recording a live stereo track, you're likely to want to
overdub other tracks.  It is possible to use Ecasound to listen to tracks
you've already recorded while recording (and listening to) a new track.
</p><p>
To listen to an already-recorded track while recording a second track,
create three Ecasound chains (Table 2).
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x122a580.0x131ac80"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 2. Chains for Listening to an Already-Recorded Track While
Recording a Second Track</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 2. Chains for Listening to an Already-Recorded Track While&#10;Recording a Second Track8781t2.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Chain</th><th>Input Source</th><th>Output Destination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>track1.wav</td><td>JACK</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>JACK</td><td>JACK</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>JACK</td><td>track2.wav</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Creating a chain setup like this causes the contents of track1.wav to
be sent to JACK to be played, and any input from JACK is sent back
to JACK and saved to a file called track2.wav.  track2.wav
will contain only the new track&mdash;not the new track mixed with the old
track.  We'll mix them later.
</p><p>
Converting this chain setup to an actual Ecasound command is
straightforward:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ecasound -c -b:64 \
-a:1 -i track1.wav \
-a:2,3 -i jack_auto \
-a:1,2 -o jack_auto \
-a:3 -o track2.wav
</pre>
</p><p>
Recording further tracks is a similar process.  We create a chain
for each of our already-recorded tracks and set their output to JACK.  We
also set up two chains to take input from JACK and send it to a file and
back to JACK, so we can hear it.  The chain setup in Table 3 would
suffice.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x122a580.0x131b570"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 3. Chains for Recording More Tracks</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 3. Chains for Recording More Tracks8781t3.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Chain</th><th>Input Source</th><th>Output Destination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>track1.wav</td><td>JACK</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>track2.wav</td><td>JACK</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>JACK</td><td>JACK</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>JACK</td><td>track3.wav</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
This chain setup translates into the following Ecasound command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ecasound -c -b:64 \
-a:1 -i track1.wav \
-a:2 -i track2.wav \
-a:3,4 -i jack_auto \
-a:1,2,3 -o jack_auto \
-a:3 -o track3.wav
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x131bf10"></a>
Recording a Software-Based Sound Source</h2></div></div><p>
I'm not a drummer, but some of the things I record need drums.  Although
the Hydrogen drum machine is probably the best that I have seen on Linux,
it hasn't yet attained the magical 1.0 version number and isn't yet
perfect.  One feature that's broken in the snapshot I'm running is the ability
to export to a PCM audio .wav file.  As luck, or rather good design,
would have it, Hydrogen can use JACK to output digital audio.
</p><p>
To use JACK and Ecasound to record the output of an audio application
such as Hydrogen, we can perform the following steps:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Configure Hydrogen to use JACK for its output.
</p></li><li><p>
Configure Hydrogen to play in song mode, as opposed to pattern mode.
</p></li><li><p>
Execute the the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ecasound -a:1 -i jack_auto -o drum_track.wav -G jack,ecasound,recv
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Click the play button in Hydrogen.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The above command configures a single chain within Ecasound that draws
input from JACK and sends output to a file called drum_track.wav.  The
-G jack,ecasound,recv instructs Ecasound to listen to JACK for a start
command, which is sent when we click the Play button in Hydrogen,
as a JACK client called ecasound.
</p><p>
It can take a second or so for Ecasound to start and initialise after
receiving the start command, so I like to have a pattern of silence at
the start of the Hydrogen track.
</p><p>
Unless you have impeccable timing, you would most likely record any
software sources first.  It is harder to synchronise a software source,
such as a drum machine, with an existing human-recorded track than is is
to record the human tracks around the machine-created tracks.  This
includes any MIDI tracks you intend to use.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x131c4e8"></a>
Mixing All Tracks to a Single Stereo Master</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, we have a series of .wav files that correspond to each
of the audio tracks we have recorded.  Should we need to, we could use
Ecasound, SoX or even Audacity to add effects or make minor corrections
or alterations to any of the tracks.  Once we're happy with the individual
tracks, we can mix a single master track.
</p><p>
The process of turning our multiple tracks into a single stereo master
track is straightforward.  We create a chain for each track and
set the output to be a .wav file.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x122a580.0x131c648"></a><p class="title"><b>
Table 4. Turning Multiple Tracks into a Single Stereo Master</b></p><table     summary="&#10;Table 4. Turning Multiple Tracks into a Single Stereo Master8781t4.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Chain</th><th>Input Source</th><th>Output Destination</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>track1.wav</td><td>all_tracks.wav</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>track2.wav</td><td>all_tracks.wav</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>track3.wav</td><td>all_tracks.wav</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
Ecasound provides a means to make this particular case easier.  The all
pseudo-chain name can be used to redirect the output of all of our tracks
to a single place, namely a file called all_tracks.wav:


<pre     class="programlisting">
ecasound -a:1 -i track1.wav \
-a:2 -i track2.wav \
-a:3 -i track3.wav \
-a:all -o all_tracks.wav
</pre>
</p><p>
To listen to the result, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ecasound -a:1 -i all_tracks.wav -o jack_auto
</pre>
</p><p>
It is also possible to write the master directly to the sound card
without writing to a file first:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ecasound -a:1 -i track1.wav \
-a:2 -i track2.wav \
-a:3 -i track3.wav \
-a:all -o jack_auto
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can attach a series of effects, including reverb,
compression and amplification to each chain before it is written to
the output destination.  It is even possible to add delay and alter the
panning of a particular track or even perform noise reduction;
however, such topics are beyond the scope of this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122a580.0x16305e0"></a>
Summary</h2></div></div><p>
As we have demonstrated, it is possible to create a simple multitrack
recording using a handful of Linux audio tools.  Once we started
jackd, it was a simple process of telling Ecasound where to receive
input from and where to send output to as we recorded our initial track
and overdubbed a series of subsequent tracks.
</p><p>
Each of these tracks has been stored in its own individual .wav
file.  This allows us to use any other soundfile editor to make manual
modifications to the track before mixing a final track, which can then
also be tweaked.  Common applications for processing audio files include
Ecasound, SoX and Audacity.
</p><p>
We have really just scratched the surface of this particular aspect of a
large field.  With luck, it will form a solid foundation on which
you can build your creative genius!
