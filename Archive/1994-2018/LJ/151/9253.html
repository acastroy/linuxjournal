<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #151, November 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

The <span   class="bold"><b>Areca RAID driver</b></span> is likely to go
into the main kernel sources soon.
<span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> and others have been
working with the maintainer, <span   class="bold"><b>Erich Chen</b></span>,
to fix some remaining issues, and this work seems to be bouncing right
along. There was a small disconnect when the official merge was first
proposed, as some folks hadn't realized Erich had been actively
maintaining
the driver or working on addressing the problems.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jesse Huang</b></span> from <span   class="bold"><b>IC Plus</b></span> released an <span   class="bold"><b>IP100A
10/100 fast network adapter
driver</b></span> for inclusion, and a little corporate competition came
into play.
Jesse's code was a fork of the <span   class="bold"><b>Sundance driver
code</b></span>, with only minor
changes. In such cases, the going wisdom, as <span   class="bold"><b>Arjan
van de Ven</b></span> put it, is to
update the existing driver to support the additional hardware, instead of
starting a whole new driver. In response to this, Jesse explained that IC
Plus
was keen to have the ip100a.c filename in the kernel and possibly remove
sundance.c at some point. But, after conferring with his company, they
decided to follow best practices and just feed their changes into
sundance.c.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Al Boldi</b></span> submitted a patch to make
<span   class="bold"><b>RootFS</b></span> swappable by using tmpfs rather
than ramfs for its back-end file storage. This change would allow systems
with a large initrd or initramfs image not to tie up the RAM associated
with
that image unless it is actually in use. The idea behind Al's patch did
make
sense to folks as being useful for embedded systems. But, <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span>
pointed out that one current goal is to move initramfs initialization
earlier in the boot process to include loading firmware for built-in
device
drivers. He wasn't sure how Al's patch would affect this plan, if at all,
but
he said the migration to earlier initialization had to take precedence.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nigel Cunningham</b></span> has submitted his
<span   class="bold"><b>Suspend2</b></span> code for inclusion in Andrew
Morton's -mm tree. In spite of forking the software suspend code from
<span   class="bold"><b>Pavel
Machek</b></span> years go, this is the first time he's actually
submitted it for
inclusion anywhere. A lot of users find Suspend2 to be much better than
Pavel's uswsusp code, and they routinely download and apply Nigel's patch
even
though uswsusp is already in the kernel. Pavel, as the official software
suspend maintainer, has nearly the final word on whether anyone else's
suspend code gets into the kernel, and his antagonistic relationship with
Nigel makes it unlikely the he would let the code through without a
fight.
But, his arguments against including Nigel's code have begun to ring
hollow.
He says the in-kernel code works just as well, but then hordes of users
proclaim that no, Suspend2 works better for them. He says uswsusp is a
better idea and users should just wait for it to be ready, but Suspend2
works now and has worked well for a long time. It does seem as though
Nigel's code has proven itself, and without serious technical objections,
it should be allowed into the kernel.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Hans Reiser</b></span> is at it again, claiming that kernel developers have been
standing in the way of including <span   class="bold"><b>Reiser4</b></span>
for political reasons. Although
some
kernel brawls do seem to be politically motivated, Hans just doesn't have
the high ground. He's repeatedly hurled attacks and insults at the kernel
developers reviewing his code&mdash;to the point where several key developers
now
refuse to offer any more technical feedback on Reiser4. Without these
reviewers, it becomes very difficult for the Reiser developers even
to identify the remaining technical issues that must be addressed before the
code could be included. Because Hans doesn't seem able to see how
antagonistic
he's been, perhaps his friends should urge him to stay out of kernel
debates and let the other Reiser4 engineers speak for him. It seems to
me
that the same people who currently refuse to work with Hans would be
happy
to rejoin the effort if they didn't have to fear his attacks.

<h2 class="title">Lenovo Makes the Commitment</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #151, November 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Around two years ago, when Novell announced a corporate commitment to
move the company completely to Linux-based hardware, its laptop of
choice was IBM's ThinkPad. At LinuxWorld Expo and other Linux-related
conferences, ThinkPads were about the only brand of laptop populating
Novell booths.
</p><p>
Then, after IBM sold its PC division to China-based Lenovo, many
wondered if the ThinkPad would survive, or if the company would pay
close attention to potential Linux customers. But, ThinkPads continued to
sell, now with Lenovo instead of IBM printed on their cases. Some users
even began waxing enthusiastic about them. In June 2006, Cory Doctorow, the
prolific writer of science-fiction books and the top-ranked BoingBoing
blog, announced that he was switching after many years from Mac to Linux:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I thought about buying a MacBook Pro anyway, since they're nice
computers, and they run Ubuntu, but after pricing them out, I
realized that I could get a lot more bang for my buck with a Lenovo
ThinkPad T60p. If I'm not going to run the Mac OS, why spend extra
money for Apple hardware? I ordered the machine last weekend,
loading it to the max with two 120GB hard drives, 2GB of RAM, and
the fastest video card and best screen Lenovo sells. It was still
cheaper than a Mac, even though Lenovo makes me pay for a copy of
Windows XP that I plan on pitching out along with the styrofoam
cutouts and other worthless packaging.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
With that kind of writing on the wall, something big was bound to
happen. And, at the latest LinuxWorld Expo [August 2006], it did. Lenovo revealed
that it would make the first Linux-based ThinkPad &ldquo;mobile
workstation&rdquo;.
It will come with Novell SUSE Linux Enterprise 10, on a ThinkPad T60p,
which is built around Intel's new 2.3GHz Core Duo T2700 chipset.
According to Novell PR honcho Bruce Lowry, the new offering is the
product of a joint effort between Lenovo, Novell and Intel engineers.
</p><p>
For the last three years, most of my Linux life has been on a ThinkPad
T40, most recently running Novell's SUSE Linux desktop. It's been good,
but it's also been a hermit crab. You can tell by the &ldquo;Access
IBM&rdquo;
button that works only if the machine is running Windows. Well, on the
Linux-equipped ThinkPad T60p, that button gets you the Lenovo Help
Center, which covers ThinkVantage Technologies, drivers, basic Linux
configuration and hardware issues. Novell handles core operating system
issues.
</p><p>
Both companies are working to make sure media runs well on the machine
too. By the end of this year, an upgraded RealPlayer will play Windows
media files, the company says. Lenovo also says the current Helix Banshee
player in SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (SLED) 10 is the only Linux
software that allows encoding of MP3 audio files and burning audio CDs.
</p><p>
I'm looking forward to trying out this new configuration. (As a
notoriously clumsy user, I expect to give the help desks a workout.)
Meanwhile, look for Cory Doctorow's Mac-to-Ubuntu migration account in
an upcoming issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.

<h2 class="title">First Look: Sony's New mylo Handheld</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #151, November 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
mylo (for &ldquo;my life online&rdquo;) is Sony's new competitor against the Nokia
770 in the Linux-based handheld computer category. It's a bit smaller (1
x 4.8 x 2.5 inches), has a 2.4-inch QBVGA (320 x 240) LCD screen, and a
retractable keyboard. Where the 770 is a rectangular tablet (with a much
larger screen), the mylo has rounded corners and looks more like a
mobile phone.
</p><p>
Like the 770, however, the mylo is not a phone, but rather supports IP
telephony systems, such as Skype, which is also listed by Sony as one of
its four mylo &ldquo;partners&rdquo;. As of August 2006, the others are JiWire (for
finding 802.11b Wi-Fi hotspots), Yahoo and Google (both for instant
messaging and e-mail).
</p><p>
Perhaps most significant, from a historical perspective, is that Sony is
supporting audio formats other than its own. The mylo comes with support
for MP3 audio, as well as Sony's own ATRAC3 and Microsoft's WMA. It
also has a built-in MPEG-4 video player. Until now, Sony has avoided
making MP3 players, a category now dominated by Apple's iPod.
</p><p>
Files can be transferred to and from the mylo either by USB2 connections
or Sony's proprietary (but common) Memory Stick removable Flash media.
</p><p>
Sony hasn't released any hardware specs (such as processor or speed), but
among the specs it shares are 1GB internal Flash RAM, a rechargeable
3.7-volt battery (and external 6 V DC power adapter), video playing time
of up to 8 hours and talk time of up to 3.5 hours.
</p><p>
In general, the mylo is designed to work immediately as a consumer
electronics device. But, it's still a Linux-based computer. And, like the
770, it is open to application development through the Qtopia platform
from Trolltech.
</p><p>
We will be taking a closer look at the mylo in the next few months. In the
meantime, feel free to share your own experiences with the device. Write
