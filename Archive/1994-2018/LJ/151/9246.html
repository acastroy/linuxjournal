Leverage the Linux kernel's virtualization features to isolate network
d&aelig;mons.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2116580.0x220e3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my May 2006 Paranoid Penguin column, I expounded on the virtues of Debian 3.1's excellent
support for virtualization environments, including User-Mode Linux.  In
that same issue, in the article &ldquo;User-Mode Linux&rdquo;,
Matthew Hoskins gave a quick-and-dirty recipe for test-driving User-Mode
Linux using prebuilt UML kernels and root filesystem images.
</p><p>
Did those articles whet your appetite for a more comprehensive and security-focused
look at using UML? If so, you're in luck; for the next couple of columns, we're
going to dive into the User-Mode Linux experience and cover every step
(including every command) for creating your very
own User-Mode Linux containers for network services.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2116580.0x220e558"></a>
Objectives</h2></div></div><p>
So, why are we doing this, and what do we hope to achieve? As I've said
before in this space, virtualization is similar to the concept of the
chroot (changed root) jail.  It encapsulates a process or d&aelig;mon into a
subset of the operating environment in which it resides, in a manner that
makes it much harder for attackers to get at the underlying environment
should they succeed in compromising that process or d&aelig;mon.
</p><p>
Whereas chrooting restricts a process to a subset of the host system's real
filesystem, virtualization restricts the process to a complete virtual
machine running within the host (real) machine.  This includes a completely
virtualized hard disk, memory and kernel, and even virtualized system
devices, such as network and sound cards.  In the case of User-Mode Linux,
this is achieved by running a guest (virtual) kernel as a user-space
process within the host (real) kernel.
</p><p>
Because both guest and host kernel are Linux kernels, virtualization
in User-Mode Linux is fast and efficient.  And, because the guest kernel does
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> need to run as root under the host kernel, even
attackers who
compromise some d&aelig;mon on the guest system <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
escalate their
privileges to root (on the guest system) <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> somehow manage to
gain shell access to the underlying host system will have achieved
only unprivileged access to that host system.
</p><p>
This does not make it impossible to gain root access to the host system.
If attackers do make it as far as shell access on the host, they
may be able to escalate their privileges via some local privilege
escalation vulnerability in the host's kernel or some user-space
program on the host.  (Remember: no vulnerability is strictly local
on <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> networked system!) It
<span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> mean, however, that it's
more difficult for attackers to get to the point of being able to exploit
such a vulnerability, especially if it isn't also present on the guest
(virtual) system.
</p><p>
This brings us to our design goals.  The guest machine should be
as bare-bones as possible with respect to installed software&mdash;both
to minimize resource utilization and to minimize its potential for
compromise (its attack surface).  If, for example, the guest machine
is to act as a DNS server, it should have basic network support, BIND
(or some other DNS server package) and very little else.  No X Window
System and no Apache&mdash;nothing else not directly related to DNS services.
</p><p>
If you're really paranoid, you even can skip the Secure Shell d&aelig;mon
and instead administer the system via a virtual serial console.  (Though
allowing SSH from only authorized IP addresses, such as that of
the host system, might be a more reasonable middle ground.) You could
also run User-Mode Linux under SELinux; however, that's beyond the scope
of this series of articles.
</p><p>
If a single bastion server is to host multiple network services&mdash;for
example, Apache and BIND&mdash;you could run two different guest systems on
the same host: one containing only Apache and its dependent packages
and another containing only BIND et al.  In this way, a vulnerability in
BIND would not lead directly to Web site defacement.  Conversely, a poorly
coded Web application would not necessarily lead to DNS tampering.
</p><p>
In summary, our two design principles will be to run one virtual
machine per major network service and to make each virtual machine
as minimal and secure as possible.  The end result will (hopefully) be
a very compartmentalized bastion server that places as much defensive
abstraction as possible between attackers and total root compromise.
</p><p>
For the remainder of this series of articles, I use the example of
a single guest system running BIND.  Both guest and host system are
based on Debian 3.1, because Debian is so popular for UML guests (it
lends itself to stripped-down installations&mdash;a trait it shares with
Slackware).  However, most of what follows also applies to other Linux
distributions on both host and guest.
</p><p>
Our tasks are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Build a host kernel optimized for hosting User-Mode Linux guests.
</p></li><li><p>
Build one or more guest kernels to run on top of the host.
</p></li><li><p>
Obtain and customize a prebuilt root filesystem for our guests.
</p></li><li><p>
Run, configure and harden our guest system for secure DNS services.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2116580.0x220ee48"></a>
Preparing the Host</h2></div></div><p>
First, you need to make sure you've got the right kind
of kernel on your host system.  You very likely may need
to compile a new kernel.
</p><p>
On the one hand, some Linux distributions already have User-Mode Linux
compiled into their default kernels.  On the other hand, your distribution
of choice may or may not also have the skas (separate kernel address
space) patch compiled in as well.  It is, in fact, somewhat unlikely that
your default kernel has skas support.  Although the Linux kernel source
code has included UML support since version 2.6.9, the skas patch is still
maintained separately (and Linus has resisted its inclusion).
</p><p>
The skas patch is important.  It greatly improves UML performance
and security by running the guest system's kernel in separate
address space from its other processes (just like the host's
kernel does).  The User-Mode Linux Web site's skas page on SourceForge
provides a more detailed
explanation of why you need skas (see the on-line Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2116580.0x220f000"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Keeping Your Kernels and Guests Straight</b></p><p>
In the contexts of User-Mode Linux, VMware and other virtualization
systems, we use the words host and guest in a very specific way.  Your
host is the system that runs the virtualization environment&mdash;that
is, it acts as a host to one or more virtual machines.  Guests
are virtual machine instances that live on top of the host.
</p><p>
Therefore, when we speak of the host kernel and guest kernels,
remember that guest kernels run on top of the host kernel.  In
User-Mode Linux, your host kernel is a normal Linux kernel, compiled
for your particular hardware platform (Intel x86, IBM PowerPC and so on),
with User-Mode Linux features (including the optional skas patch)
compiled in as well.
</p><p>
Your guest kernel, on the other hand, must be compiled to run on virtual
hardware: the um architecture.  Other than that, it does
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
need the skas patch or User-Mode Linux support enabled.  Unless, that is,
you want to run other guest kernels on top of it.  Running guests
within guests is possible (this is called nesting), but well beyond
the scope of this article.
</p><p>
Each UML virtual machine instance consists of a guest kernel, a guest root
filesystem and a COW (Copy On Write) file.  The root filesystem is a disk
image file; it contains every file in your virtual machine except the
kernel itself.  When you execute a guest kernel, the root filesystem file
is mounted in precisely the same way you'd mount any other disk image,
for example, a CD ISO file.  Like a CD-ROM, it's used in read-only mode.
Any changes you make to the virtual filesystem in the course of a UML
session, including new files and file deletions, are stored in a COW file.
</p><p>
Thanks to the magic of COWs, it's therefore possible to run the same
guest kernel and root filesystem combination multiple times, by defining
a unique COW file per instance.
</p></div><p>
To obtain kernel source code, your best bet may be simply to install your
Linux distribution's kernel-source package.  Take care, however, that your
distribution provides a kernel version of 2.6.9 or higher, because
UML support is included from 2.6.9 onward,
and prior UML patches had security vulnerabilities.
</p><p>
Because Debian 3.1 still uses kernel version 2.6.8, I decided not to use
the official Debian kernel packages and instead downloaded the 2.6.17
kernel from kernel.org.  I did, however, install the kernel-package
package, which provides tools for generating Debian packages from official
kernel source.
</p><p>
Besides kernel source code, you need the skas patch, the
latest version of which is available on Blaisorblade's site (see Resources).  Be sure to download the
patch version that corresponds to the kernel source code you're about
to patch.
</p><p>
On my Debian host, I unpacked my official source code to
/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3, renamed the source code directory to
/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-host and copied the skas patch tarball
(skas-2.6.17-rc5-v9-pre9.patch.bz2) to /usr/src.  I then changed ownership
of the directory /usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-host to a nonroot account.  (Adhering to the principle of never being root unless you really need to,
we're going to do most of this kernel build as an unprivileged user.)
</p><p>
Here are the commands I executed as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
host:/usr/src/# tar -xjvf ./linux-2.6.17.3.tar.bz
host:/usr/src/# mv ./linux-2.6.17.3 ./linux-2.6.17.3-host
host:/usr/src/# chown mick ./linux-2.6.17.3
host:/usr/src/# su - mick
</pre>
</p><p>
To apply the skas patch, I then navigated, as my nonroot user, to
/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-host and ran the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
host:/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-host$ bunzip2 -c
 &#8618;../skas-2.6.17-rc5-v9 -pre9.patch.bz2 | patch -p1
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, from the same directory, I issued the command <tt  >make
menuconfig</tt>.  When
setting up the kernel configuration for User-Mode Linux, the defaults
generally are fine, though you should ensure that the
configuration matches your host's hardware.  In addition, it's probably
prudent to double-check the following settings:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Under Processor type and features, make sure /proc/mm is enabled.
</p></li><li><p>
Under Networking options, make sure IP: tunneling and 802.1d Ethernet
Bridging are enabled.  If you intend to restrict guest system behavior
with iptables, you also may want to check the Network packet filtering
section to ensure that Core Netfilter Configuration, IP: Netfilter
Configuration and Bridged IP/ARP packets filtering are set up.
</p></li><li><p>
Under Network device support, enable Universal TUN/TAP
device driver support.
</p></li><li><p>
And, by all means, make sure to hard-compile (into the kernel, not as
a module) the filesystem in which your system's root partition is formatted
(for example, ext3 or ReiserFS).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
From this point on, the process is the same with any other kernel
build: issue the commands <tt  >make bzImage</tt> and
<tt  >make modules;</tt>.  Then, become
root and issue the commands <tt  >make modules</tt>,
<tt  >make modules_install</tt> and
<tt  >make install</tt>.  (Or in the case of Debian, use the
<tt  >make-kpkg</tt> command
to achieve the same thing, and run <tt  >dpkg</tt> to install the resulting kernel
package.)
</p><p>
Once your new host kernel is installed, reboot your system.  Your host
system is now capable of running User-Mode Linux guest systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2116580.0x2607fb8"></a>
Creating a Guest Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
Okay, we've got UML host capabilities, but we still need a guest kernel
to run.  This process is somewhat simpler than the host-kernel build,
because we don't need the skas patch.
</p><p>
First, navigate back to the directory in which your Linux kernel-source
tarball resides, and unpack it a second time.  Remember when we renamed the
unzipped source code directory? This was so we could unpack the kernel
tarball a second time.  We need to build our host and guest kernels in
separate source trees.
</p><p>
On my Debian test system, therefore, I unpacked the source
tarball to /usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3, and this time, renamed it to
/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest.  Again, change ownership of this directory
to a nonprivileged user, and change your working directory to it.
</p><p>
Again, at this point we can skip the step of applying the skas
patch.  Because we're going to compile our kernel for the special um
(User-Mode Linux) architecture rather than for a real architecture like
x86, I recommend you prepare your source code tree with the following
three commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
host:/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest$ make mrproper ARCH=um
host:/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest$ make defconfig ARCH=um
host:/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest$ make menuconfig ARCH=um
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >make mrproper</tt> command clears out any configuration and object
files in your source tree; <tt  >make defconfig</tt> generates a fresh default
configuration file appropriate to the um architecture; and <tt  >make
menuconfig</tt>,
of course, gives you the opportunity to fine-tune this configuration file.
</p><p>
Pay particular attention to the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Life will be simpler if you skip loadable kernel module support
and hard-compile everything into the kernel.  If you really want
kernel modules, see the User-Mode Linux HOWTO, Section 2.2 (see
Resources).
</p></li><li><p>
Under Processor type and features, double-check that your system
architecture is set to um (User-Mode Linux), and make sure /proc/mm
is enabled.
</p></li><li><p>
Under Networking options, make sure IP: tunneling and 802.1d Ethernet
Bridging are enabled.
</p></li><li><p>
Under Network device support, enable Universal TUN/TAP device driver
support.
</p></li><li><p>
Disable as many of the specialized hardware kernel modules as possible; this kernel
is going to be running on virtualized hardware, so you won't need support
for wireless LAN hardware, obscure parallel-port devices and so forth.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once you've saved your new configuration file, you can compile the
kernel with this command (<span   class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> first becoming root; execute this as
an unprivileged user):

<pre     class="programlisting">
host:/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest$ make linux ARCH=um
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that I did <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> tell you to make a zipped or bzipped
image.  Remember, you're going to be running this kernel as though it
were a user-space command, so it shouldn't be compressed.  The finished
kernel will be located in the top-level directory of your source tree
(/usr/src/linux-2.6.17.3-guest in the above examples) and will be
named linux&mdash;you'll probably want to rename it to something more
descriptive, such as uml-guestkernel-2.6.17.3.  You'll also probably want
to move it to the directory from which you intend to run it&mdash;perhaps
something like /usr/local/uml/.
</p><p>
By the way, don't be scared by the size of your guest kernel file.  Most
of that bulk is symbol information that will <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be loaded into
memory when you execute it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2116580.0x2608a08"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Your host system now fully supports User-Mode Linux, and you've got a
guest kernel image to run.  The next step is to obtain or create a root
filesystem image to use with the guest kernel.  That's where we'll pick
up again next time!
