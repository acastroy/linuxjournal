Combine Asterisk and Ajax to display incoming and outgoing call
information.

I've been using an Asterisk server to handle all of our telephone service
for about a year now.  During this time, I've discovered many really
neat things that can be done with Asterisk, VoIP and various other
technologies.  One of the more gimmicky things I've done is sent the
caller-ID information from incoming calls to a Web page on my browser,
in real time.  To do this, I had to use Asterisk, Perl, CGI, HTML,
CSS, SQL, XML and Asynchronous JavaScript, or Ajax.  There are a lot of
different pieces to bring together, but sometimes that's what makes a
project interesting.
</p><p>
Here's how it works in a nutshell.  When someone calls us at the house, the
Asterisk server waits for the caller-ID information to be sent.  The server
then puts this information, and a few other pieces of information, into a
file in a subdirectory under /tmp.  This is all done in the Asterisk dial
plan.  Then, I have a Web page open in my browser that runs a JavaScript
program every second.  This JavaScript program uses an XMLHttpRequest
object to query the server for new caller-ID information.  The CGI script
on the server returns an XML file containing the caller information.  The
JavaScript program parses the returned XML and displays the content.  I've
created a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) that makes the caller information look
like a sticky note placed on the Web page.  When the incoming call is
complete, the Asterisk server creates a Call Detail Record, or CDR,
which resides in an SQL database.
</p><p>
Each time the JavaScript contacts the server, the CGI script looks for the
CDR.  If it exists, the program knows that the call is over and deletes
the caller information file in /tmp.  This has the effect of causing the
sticky notes to disappear when the call is complete.
</p><p>
As an added bonus, the program supports up to four concurrent calls and can
be used to indicate outbound calls as well.  It's kind of nice to be able
to see who's on the phone, regardless of whether the person is the caller or
callee, without having to interrupt the person on the phone to ask.  When
my boys get older, this may become an even more important feature.
</p><p>
For this system to work, you must configure your Asterisk server to
put CDRs in an SQL database.  By default, Asterisk puts CDRs in a
comma-delimited file.  The problem is that the flat file CDRs don't
contain the call's unique ID, which this system uses to detect when a
call has completed.  The CDRs that get put into the SQL database contain
this field.  This shouldn't be a steep requirement though.  As I recall,
configuring Asterisk to store CDRs in a Postgres database was fairly
straightforward and well documented in the cdr_pgsql.conf file.  You
also could use a MySQL or ODBC database, if you like.
</p><p>
The first, and easiest, part of this project is to modify the Asterisk
dial plan to create the flat file when an incoming or outgoing call is
made.  Once you determine where to make the change, it's a simple one-line
addition, as shown here (all one line):

<pre     class="programlisting">
exten =&gt; s, n, system(echo "IN#${CALLERID(name)}
&#8618;#${CALLERID(number)}#${UNIQUEID}" &gt;
&#8618;/tmp/panels/cid/${UNIQUEID})
</pre>
</p><p>
This line creates a file in /tmp/panels/cid that contains four fields,
delimited by the # character.  Of course, you need to create
/tmp/panels/cid and give it appropriate permissions so that the Asterisk
server can create files in it and the CGI script can read and delete those
files.  The first field is either IN or OUT and indicates
that the call is INcoming, or OUTgoing.  The next two fields call the
CALLERID() function to retrieve the caller's name and phone number.  The
last field is the call's unique identifier.  You need to place this line
in your dial plan, such that the server has already received the caller-ID
information but before the call is handed off to the dial command.  If
you want to receive information about outgoing calls, you could add a
line like this to your dial plan:

<pre     class="programlisting">
exten =&gt; s, n, system(echo "OUT##${EXTEN}#${UNIQUEID}"
&#8618;&gt; /tmp/panels/cid/${UNIQUEID})
</pre>
</p><p>
In the case of the outgoing call, we don't have any caller-ID information
to display, so the second field is left blank.  We do know the number
that was dialed, which is retrieved via the ${EXTEN} variable in the
third field.
</p><p>
In both the incoming and outgoing cases, you need to make sure to update
the extension field and the priority fields (s and n in
this example).
</p><p>
For the purpose of demonstration, I've stripped the Web page down to
its most basic requirements, as shown in Listing 1.

This seemingly simple HTML code does a lot of things.  First, it loads the
cid.js JavaScript code.  Then, it imports a stylesheet called cid.css.  This
stylesheet will give you a lot of flexibility to customize the appearance
of the sticky notes.  Then, the HTML code creates four div sections, called
phone1 through phone4.  These sections will be made visible later on and
will be filled in with caller information.  Finally, the HTML code starts the
periodic polling by calling the start_cid() function.  We'll discuss that
function later.
</p><p>
Even though my CSS skills aren't world-class, I've included a sample
cid.css file to get you started (Listing 2).

This CSS file could have been made more concise by putting all of
the common formatting in a common class; I'll leave that as an exercise
for the reader.  This stylesheet creates four evenly spaced sticky notes
at the bottom of the screen.  The sticky notes are yellow with a neat
3-D drop-shadow effect (Figure 1).

This Perl script scans the /tmp/panels/cid directory for files, skipping
the . and .. entries.  Each file it finds is opened and
read.  The final result is an XML file like the one shown in Listing 4.

&lt;/panel&gt;
&lt;/panels&gt;

</pre></div><p>
Of course, the XML file could contain up to four &lt;panel&gt; blocks corresponding
to phone1 through phone4.  The &lt;content&gt; block contains the text that is
put into each sticky note.  I've found that because this is an XML file,
it's difficult to embed HTML in the &lt;content&gt; block, so I don't do much
formating of this text.  It's fairly easy to see how incoming and outgoing
calls are handled separately.
</p><p>
As the XML is generated for each phone call and sent to the client,
the call to expire_call() is made.  This function simply searches the CDR
database to see if the phone call has been completed.  Asterisk adds
CDR records only when a call is concluded, so if the record is in the database,
the call is finished and the file in /tmp/panels/cid can be removed.
</p><p>
The JavaScript component is both the workhorse of the system and the
most difficult part to understand (Listing 5).

    document.getElementById("phone" + count).style.display="none";
  }

  return;
}

</pre></div><p>
As mentioned previously, the whole system is started by the initial call to
start_cid().  All this function does is arrange for the update_cid()
function to be called every second.  The update_cid() function makes
a call to get_from_server() to get an  XMLHttpRequest object in a
browser-independent fashion.  This request object is returned for
later use.
</p><p>
Next, the update_cid function calls clear_panels(), which simply arranges
for each sticky note to be empty and invisible, initially.  The sticky
notes will become visible as we put content into them.
</p><p>
The rest of the program is a bit more difficult to follow.  Using
the request object mentioned earlier, and the getElementsByTagName()
function, we get an XML object with the &lt;panels&gt; block intact.  Another
application of the getElementsByTagName() applied to this XML object
gives us an array of individual &lt;panel&gt; blocks.
</p><p>
Then, we start a loop over each &lt;panel&gt; block in the array with the
understanding that each time through the loop will correspond to a phone
call in progress; we'll create a new sticky note for each call.  Each
&lt;panel&gt; block contains a &lt;name&gt; and a &lt;content&gt; block, the
values of which we
extract into appropriate variables.  Then, by using the getElementById()
document method, we find the &lt;div&gt; element in the HTML document with
the same ID as the name of the panel.  Now we have all of the information
we need about the sticky note: the name, the content and the location
in the Web page.  So, we set the &lt;div&gt; block to be visible, then assign
some content to it via the innerHTML attribute.  Finally, we go back to
the top of the loop and continue again.
</p><p>
This &ldquo;poll the server and display the results&rdquo; process runs every
second without any intervention from the user and without having to
reload the Web page.  This gives the user the perception that the sticky
notes simply pop up when the phone rings and disappear when the phone
is hung up.
</p><p>
As you can see, JavaScript is a very powerful language.  Unfortunately,
browser support and development tools for JavaScript are poor to
nonexistent.  During the development of this program, I had to contend
with browser crashes, inadvertently cached information and cryptic
runtime error messages.  Once I got it working, I had to make sure it
worked on each of the browsers I use regularly, Konqueror and Firefox.  I
suspect that it will run on &ldquo;that other browser&rdquo;, but I've not tested
it.  Because I do most of my software development with vi, I'm not really
big on Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), but if you know
of one that works well for JavaScript, I'd love to hear from you.
</p><p>
Now that the program is working, it's time to think about ways to
improve and extend it.  The first obvious change I'd like to make to this
program is to have it display a hyperlink that would allow me to bring
up additional information about the caller.  It could get this information
from my contact list or even from an additional database.  Maybe it could
display a picture of the caller, though it might take a lot of time to
photograph all my friends, family and acquaintances.  It might also be
nice to have a button display for incoming calls that would allow me to
reject an incoming call and have it go straight to voice mail.  I could
also extend this same method to have a Web page display other information
besides caller ID.  It wouldn't be hard to extend this system to let me
know when I have unread voice mail waiting, or when my friends become
available for chat via IM.
</p><p>
So there you have it&mdash;a fun little toy that brings together many different
tools and technologies.  Recalling that Qwest used to charge us $6 US a month
for caller ID, I wonder what they would charge to make it Web-accessible?
