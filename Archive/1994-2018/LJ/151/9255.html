Nothing says dynamic like video, and some people out there are
doing some amazing things.  Of course, I know some people would
rather sit back and watch all this action than make it themselves.  So grab your
remote, sit back and enjoy your wine!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbed580.0xce53a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Yes, Fran&ccedil;ois, it does seem that way sometimes.  Despite all the great
hopes that the Web would become a place where the world could interact
and share knowledge, that knowledge does occasionally tip toward
entertainment.  The epitome of dynamic Web development seems to have
culminated in a new video delivery system.  Of course, you can learn a
great deal from videos, and many sites allow the people who visit to
comment and discuss the ideas expressed in those videos.  It's true that
some of what we find out there is effectively cut and pasted from
television, but some people are taking advantage of this relatively
inexpensive video delivery medium to stretch their creative muscles and
share their ideas with the world.  What it does show, in my opinion, is
that there is an amazing amount of talent out there.  This technology not
only enables those people to reach out to the world, but it also enables the
watchers to experience fresh, new talent.
</p><p>
I see that our guests approach, Fran&ccedil;ois.  Pay attention to today's menu.
I've got something that takes this whole Internet television concept to a
new level.  Ah, here they are.  Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>,
home of fine Linux cuisine and exquisite wines.  Fran&ccedil;ois and I were just
discussing the explosion of video on the World Wide Web and what it means
for both content creators and video consumers.  Please, sit down while I
send my faithful waiter to fetch the wine.  I believe we still have two
cases of the 2000 Ch&acirc;teau La Tour Blanche in the cellar.  Please, bring it
back quickly.
</p><p>
There's a lot of content out there, and Internet video broadcasting (or
vodcasting) is creating a busy landscape, sometimes confusing to
navigate.  One of the coolest programs I've run across in a while makes
this whole mess of trying to find great Internet videos just that much
easier.  Called Democracy, this is an open-source Internet
television watching program with an interesting mandate at its core.  The
group behind Democracy is a not-for-profit organization that calls itself the
Participatory Culture Foundation.  This group, like many others I'm sure,
is concerned about the fact that so much of our media is controlled and
filtered through a handful of large corporations.  It feels that the best
hope for dealing with this kind of centralized editorial and media
control is to support an open standards, participatory Internet TV
format.  Part of its solution is the Democracy Internet TV media player.
</p><p>
Here's how it works.  The program lets you find, download, record, manage
and watch Internet television programs.  Those of you who have a TiVo at
home will understand the beauty of this concept.  By default, downloaded
videos are saved for five days, at which point they are automatically
deleted.  If you want to save them permanently, you do have that option.
Democracy also plays in full screen, so you can take advantage of that
21-inch flat-panel screen in front of you.  With an integrated
channel guide, a community-based rating system and associated publishing
tools (so you can get in on the action), there's a lot more to Democracy
than just watching TV.  Because you'll more than likely start out watching
content, I'll tell you all about that in a moment.  First, though, I
think Fran&ccedil;ois has returned.  Please, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, make sure everyone's
glass has been filled.
</p><p>
To get your copy of Democracy, pay a visit to
its Web site (see the on-line Resources).  The site offers packages for
Ubuntu, Fedora and plain-old Debian.  Source is also available if you
can't find a package for your particular distribution.  Installing
Democracy TV is no big deal, but I should warn you that it does require
Mozilla and the associated packages.  I make a point of mentioning this
because many of us are now running Firefox instead of Mozilla.  If you are
downloading Mozilla as a package (or packages), make sure you have the
development and PSM packages as well.
</p><p>
When you start Democracy the first time, you'll be presented with a
&ldquo;How to Get Started&rdquo; guide.  After the first time, the player
opens up
to its on-line channel guide (Figure 1).  Randomly selected channels
from different categories will appear on the page.  If the brief
description under the image isn't enough, you can click the
&ldquo;more&rdquo; link
to find more information.  If the show sounds interesting, subscribing
to that channel is as easy as clicking the green Add button.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9255f1.large.jpg"><img src="9255f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1.
You'll love Democracy's integrated channel guide.  Find the shows that
interest you, and add the channel with a click.
</p></div></div><p>
The sidebar to the right of the channel guide provides you with
alternative ways of navigating the guide.  You can search channels by
keyword (for example Linux or open source) or browse the channels in different
ways.  Sort it alphabetically, check out the various categories, choose
categories
based on tags, or bring up the list of the most popular channels.
</p><p>
The interface is extremely easy to work with, and nothing takes away from
the experience of watching the various channels.  Down on the left-hand
side is a small menu at the top, with a list of subscribed channels
below.  Democracy does start up with a handful of subscribed channels,
none of which you have to keep, but these channels are a good way to get the feel of
the program.  If you are like me, you'll want to watch something right away,
so let's do that.  Click on any channel, and you get a list of the
currently available episodes for that show in the main window to the left
(Figure 2).  This main window, by the way, is also the window where
you watch your shows.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9255f2.large.jpg"><img src="9255f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Selecting a channel
brings up a list of the episodes currently available for download.
</p></div></div><p>
Each video is listed on the page with a small thumbnail to the left and a
description of the video to the right.  A link back to the site from which the video originated is
often included with the description.
Now, look at the thumbnail image, and you'll see a little
blue down arrow in the lower-right corner.  Click that arrow, and the video
downloads into your collection.  Remember, this isn't a streaming video
application, but a digital video recorder.  As the video downloads, a
little progress meter appears to the left of the entry (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9255f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. As
shows are downloaded, a graphical meter keeps track of the progress.
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see from the image, the download speed and the time remaining
are both displayed along with the graphical progress bar.  There's no need
to wait for that video to finish downloading.  You can add as many as you
want, and it will all happen in the background.  As you download more and
more of these videos, they will build up in your collection, which you
access by clicking the button near the top in the left-hand sidebar.
</p><p>
When you first start the package, Democracy creates a
.democracy folder in your home directory.  In that folder,
another folder is created called Movies.  As you can probably
appreciate, downloading and storing a whole lot of movies does tend to
chew up your disk space over time.  Depending on how your disk is
organized, you may want to store your movies in another folder or even
on another drive.  To change the storage location, click Video on the menu bar and
select Preferences.  In a second or two, the Preferences dialog appears
(Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9255f4.large.jpg"><img src="9255f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Most
configuration options deal with space and time (storage space and
expiration dates).
</p></div></div><p>
Democracy regularly checks your subscription list to check for new
content.  If you want, you can override the one-hour interval using the
combo box at the top.  What I really want to highlight, however, is the
issue of storage.  Click the combo box labeled Movies Directory, and you
can use the file navigator to select an alternate storage location.  Don't
click Close quite yet though.  There are other interesting settings here.
Closely related to where you store your files is the amount of space you
are willing to let them occupy.  If you don't do anything else, two
things will happen.  The first is that Democracy will download and store
as many movies as you desire until you run out of space.  The second is
that on the sixth day after you download, Democracy will
clean up after itself automatically.  If you would rather make that three days, go
ahead and change it.  The final thing I want to point out here is the Disk
Space check box (currently unchecked).  If you click the box, you can
specify how much space Democracy will make sure you have before it starts
to download a file.  When you've made all the changes you want to make,
click Close to banish the dialog.
</p><p>
All this is about watching Internet television, so let's get back to
that.  After your downloads are done, click the My Collection button to
see a list of all the shows that have been downloaded onto your system.
Each thumbnail in the list has a little play button, a green circle with
an arrow in it, that you click to play.  The movie or clip will then
start,
using your embedded movie player (Figure 5).  A slider moves along the
bottom of the main window to let you know your position on the video.
There's also a volume slider below the position slider.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9255f5.large.jpg"><img src="9255f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. I
guess you could call this &ldquo;Democracy in action&rdquo;.
</p></div></div><p>
Democracy has a nice, large viewing window, but unless you have reason not
to, why not go for the big picture? To switch to full-screen viewing
mode, click the full-screen button at the bottom of the screen.  You'll
find it to the right of the Play/Pause button.
</p><p>
As you watch more and more shows, you are likely going to find some that
you like, others that you don't, and some that you would love to
recommend to other people.  Democracy gives you an option for dealing with
all three of these possibilities.  First, if you love a show so
much that you don't want it deleted after six days, click the Save button
to the left of the description (Figure 6).  If you don't ever need to
see this video again, click the trashcan icon.  Finally, if you really,
really enjoyed a particular video, and you need to tell the world, you
have two choices.  Click the envelope icon to send an e-mail message to
your friend (or friends).  The final option is to bomb it by
clicking the bomb icon to the right of the video in your playlist
(again, see Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9255f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Share videos you like
with your friends by &ldquo;bombing&rdquo; them.
</p></div></div><p>
To bomb a video is actually a very good thing,
and here's why.  Doing
this fires up your default browser (such as Konqueror or Firefox) and opens
you up to the page for that video on the Videobomb.com Web site.  There,
your vote (bomb) will be added to others, raising the profile of that
video in the list.  To do this, you first need to create an account on the
Videobomb.com site.  Not only will this allow you to vote for the videos
you enjoy, but it also provides a page to which you can direct your
friends, so
you can chat about the shows you bombed.
</p><p>
The young lady at table 12 suggests that this is yet another social
networking site and she is correct.  What makes this one different,
however, is its tie-in to the on-demand Democracy player.  In that
respect, it brings the whole channel surfing, recording, watching and
talking about it experience full circle.  It's like hanging around the
water cooler at work, chatting about what you watched last night, but in
an instant gratification kind of way.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu!</em></span> Is it that time already? Once again, the clock is telling
us that closing time has arrived, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>.  Of course, it won't be
the first time that any of us has spent hours in front of the television
until the late hours.  We just don't often have this kind of selection.
Perhaps Fran&ccedil;ois would be so kind as to refill our glasses a final time,
so that we can raise a toast.  Please raise your
glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one another's health.
