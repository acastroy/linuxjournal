JasperSoft's JasperServer Professional</h2></div></div><p>
If you are charged with the task of leveraging IT to help your
company make better business decisions, check out the new JasperServer
Professional from JasperSoft.  Built on the JasperServer Open Source
Project, this product is a business intelligence (BI) server that
offers ad hoc reporting and analysis intended to simplify the creation
of customized reports.  JasperServer Professional offers, according
to its maker, &ldquo;everyone in an organization the power to create his
or her
own BI reports&rdquo; that are tailored to his or her own needs.  In addition,
the server is certified with a wide range of third-party platforms,
including Apace Tomcat, MySQL, various Linux distros and Unices and more.
Customers opting for the subscription service can obtain enterprise-class
support and training, indemnification, commercial licensing, access to
the customer portal and so on.  The Open Source edition of JasperServer, as
well as an evaluation edition of the commercial product, are available for
download at JasperSoft's Web site.

eXcito's Bubba Server</h2></div></div><p>
No, friends, this new computer from eXcito has nothing to do with our
president emeritus, Bill Clinton! Bubba Server, recently released by
eXcito of Sweden, is a diminutive, multifunction, Debian-powered device
for the home or SOHO, dubbed by its producer as a &ldquo;lifestyle
home-server&rdquo;.
After connecting Bubba to broadband, it's ready to function as any number
of servers for you right out of the box: file, Web, FTP, backup, mail
(IMAP, SMTP, POP) and so on.  Bubba's main features, sayeth eXcito, are
the ability to &ldquo;access your files and different e-mail accounts from
any location&rdquo;, its small footprint (18 x 11 x 4cm) and quiet, fanless
operation (max. 28dB in active mode).  You can acquire your own Bubba
with either an 80GB or 250GB hard drive.

Lenovo's ThinkPad T60p Linux Mobile Workstation</h2></div></div><p>
While the heavy-hitting PC makers have shipped and supported Linux
desktops worldwide, here at home in the US they have been intimidated
into keeping their cupboards bare.  What would we do without our
scrappy entrepreneurs who have built their Linux-PC empires from scratch?
In order for the Linux desktop finally to get traction, the big guys need
to bless it and support it, and perhaps Lenovo's new ThinkPad T60p Linux
Mobile Workstation will finally ignite some momentum.  With the T60p,
Lenovo is starting with the high end, as this device is intended mainly
for electronic engineers doing integrated circuit and board-level design
who desire mobility.  Lenovo is currently certifying requisite design
apps from companies such as Cadence, Synopsys and Mentor Graphics, which
will run on top of SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 (SLED 10); the latter
is fully supported via Lenovo's Help Center.  One drawback to the T60p
is that, although SLED 10 is supported, it does not come pre-installed.
We hope that the efforts invested here will trickle down.

Openbravo r2.11</h2></div></div><p>
It is exciting to see a range of firms leveraging the open-source model
to provide high-end applications.  Openbravo (both the company and app
name) finds its niche as an open-source, Web-based enterprise management
solution for small and mid-sized enterprises.  The application provides
for fully integrated management of key business functions such as CRM,
billing, data, procurement, inventory, projects, services, production,
financial/accounting and business intelligence.  Openbravo claims that
its architecture is &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo;, utilizing &ldquo;a unique combination
of MVC and MDD development frameworks&rdquo;, as well as its own engine for
generating application binaries from the MDD dictionary, called WAD.
New features in the new r2.11 include several new modules, expanded
Web Services features, an improved interface and expanded documentation.

Trolltech's Qtopia Greenphone</h2></div></div><p>
Linux companies love colors.  We've seen red hats, black ducks, yellow
dogs and blue bicuspids.  What could be next, pray tell? Trolltech says,
green phones! The company's brand-new product, the Qtopia Greenphone,
is an open, Linux-based mobile device for application developers of
all stripes, allowing them to &ldquo;create, modify and test Linux-based
mobile phone applications on a working GSM/GPRS device&rdquo; that also
has a functioning camera.  Trolltech offers Greenphone as part of
its software development kit containing the Qt-based Qtopia Phone
Edition, an application platform and a UI for Linux-based mobile phones.
The company says that Greenphone offers a number of product features and
benefits, including an open software stack, accelerated time to market,
simplified development processes and reduced costs.  Trolltech also
sees Greenphone as the first in a series of open mobile devices.
Next up, mauve?

Movidis Inc.'s Revolution x16 Server</h2></div></div><p>
Like Trolltech, Movidis, Inc., has gone &ldquo;green&rdquo; as well, only theirs is
related to its eco-friendliness.  The firm's new Revolution x16 Server
is built to provide a single architecture that will perform multiple
server functions, for both applications and storage, while consuming a
mere 50 Watts.  Movidis' approach is to utilize Cavium Networks' OCTEON
CN3860, a 16-core, 64-bit MIPS processor that will execute nearly 20-billion instructions per second.  According to Movidis, the OCTEON is
&ldquo;optimized for moving data around a network&mdash;just what most servers
spend their cycles on&rdquo;.  The Revolution x16's other key features are
integrated accelerators that perform encryption, compression and TCP
packet processing in hardware rather than software, as well as Debian
burned into the on-board Flash.  The Revolution x16 is available in 1U
or 2U rackmount enclosures, with either four or eight SATA or SAS drives for
a maximum capacity of 6TB on a single 2U RAID system.

rPath's rBuilder</h2></div></div><p>
The folks at rPath have upgraded their rBuilder product to version 2.0,
a platform for creating and maintaining Linux-based software appliances.
In essence, rBuilder allows the ISV to import a desired application
and combine it with the company's own rPath Linux and create either a
software, hardware or virtual appliance image.  The result, says rPath,
is a reduction in software complexity and cost &ldquo;by making the operating
system disappear&rdquo;.  With the appliance as a solution, the ISV can provide
its customers with a simplified installation, integration and maintenance
process.  New in version 2.0 are improved appliance administration,
easier customization of administrative interfaces, simplified updates
delivered via the Internet to customer locations and the ability to
create CD/DVD images for demonstration purposes so that customers can
try before they buy.
