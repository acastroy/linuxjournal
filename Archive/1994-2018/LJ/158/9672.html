Now that Linux has won, what's the next cause to take on?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e1580.0x26d9348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The best LinuxWorld Expos were the early ones. There were two in 1999
alone, both in the San Jose Convention Center. The second one, in
August, had an official attendance of 14,278. It felt like ten times
that many. My favorite memory of that show was sitting among thousands
of geeks packed into a vast space where they could hear (though barely
see) Linus Torvalds speak, hanging on every word as if Linus were Billy
Graham calling the Faithful to a crusade. Never mind that Linus' whole
schtick was the antithesis of box office, and that most of what he
wanted to talk about&mdash;as always&mdash;was incremental progress on the Linux
kernel.
</p><p>
Linux energy back then was like the electric charge that swells in hills
below a gathering thundercloud. The high-tension wires that crossed the
computing world sparked and glowed with vast anticipation of a world
where the advantages of open over closed, free over captive, common over
exclusive, were all as plain as day to the Faithful&mdash;but to few others.
</p><p>
Now the storm has passed, lightning has flown, and the world we expected
is largely here. In GhandiCon
(<a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/G/GandhiCon.html" target="_self">www.faqs.org/docs/jargon/G/GandhiCon.html</a>) terms (first they
ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win),
we've pretty much arrived at GhandiCon Four. Of course, the future is not
evenly distributed. Desktop Linux, for example, has been arriving
asymptotically for years. All we need to close that gap is one smart
hardware OEM move, which has to happen eventually. (See UpFront for the
Dell IdeaStorm story, which is very encouraging.)
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the device drivers keep piling up. If we spelled out the whole
LAMP stack, it would be more than 145,000 letters long. Today, it's kinda
hard to build &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; to anything requiring computing and Net
connections and not to take advantage of so many free and open building
materials. There is also a huge demand market for smart techies who not
only know how to build with those materials, but how to improve them as
well.
</p><p>
Yet the number of Linux queries (<a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=linux" target="_self">www.google.com/trends?q=linux</a>)
on Google has trended downward during the past two years. Although the news
volume has held steady, the query volume today is about half what it was
at the end of 2003. (That's as far back as Google goes, and it doesn't
give precise numbers.)
</p><p>
That's why fighting for Linux today is like fighting for geology, botany
or the periodic table. There may be some holdouts around less sensible
paradigms, but what's the point? The Linux Revolution has become the
Linux Establishment. We've won. Now what?
</p><p>
Good question. (That's what you say when you don't know the answer.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Good question</em></span>.) Here at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, we like a
good cause as much as the next magazine. And, we'd like to celebrate
Linux's victory in exactly the way you'd expect any born fighter to
behave: by looking for new fights.
</p><p>
Fights are naturally interesting. That's what story theory says. For a
story you need only three elements: 1) a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>protagonist</em></span>&mdash;somebody or
something you care about and can identify with; 2) a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>problem</em></span> against
which the protagonist struggles; and 3) <span   class="emphasis"><em>movement</em></span> toward a resolution.
You don't have a story if your protagonist isn't interesting, the
problem is pointless, or if there's no movement toward an end state.
That's why sports and war stories are so compelling.
</p><p>
So, what will our story, or stories, be? I'll suggest four and leave the
rest up to you.

Citizens vs. Carriers</h2></div></div><p>
Linux and the Net have grown together ever since Apache became the
standard Web server in the mid-1990s. Yet while Linux rocks on, the Net
is becoming trapped in carrier silos. Net users today are no less
trapped by their phone or cable companies than personal computer users in
1999 were trapped by Microsoft Windows.
</p><p>
The difference is that every carrier is its own Microsoft, every Net
service is as crippled as Windows, and customer choice (in the US, at
least) is between Tweedle-telco and Tweedle-cableco&mdash;or just one of
those. These carriers still look relatively good to customers because
the connection speeds they offer (labeled &ldquo;broadband&rdquo; or
&ldquo;high speed&rdquo;)
are many times higher than dial-up. It's too easy to forget that dial-up
was what broke Net access wide open, making it available to nearly
everybody&mdash;and did it in spite of the phone companies, rather than
because of them. If it hadn't been for the original dial-up ISPs&mdash;The
Little Garden, Panix, Batnet, Earthlink and even AOL&mdash;the Net still
would belong only to universities, government and big business.
</p><p>
Now customers think the Net is gravy on top of their phone or cable TV
services. They don't realize that the Net is the real base utility, and
that it can carry any kind of gravy you like, including telephony and
television. Almost nobody talks about all the businesses a wide-open
Internet makes possible, mostly because the cablecos and telcos support
consumption and discourage production. The &ldquo;Net Neutrality&rdquo; fight is a
red herring. Most &ldquo;high-speed Internet&rdquo; customers have never experienced
truly neutral service. Instead, they've enjoyed asymmetrical bandwidth
and port blockages, without ever tasting what they've been missing.
</p><p>
Things are much better in some other parts of the world. Japan and Korea
have notoriously high bandwidth at low prices, for example. The country
with the highest broadband penetration is Denmark, with Estonia not far
behind. However, all is not rosy there either. Networks may be fast in Korea,
but Microsoft's market share in many categories, including desktops,
verges on 100%. Broadband growth in Europe has recently slowed in
regions (including Denmark) where incumbent carriers are making comebacks.
</p><p>
The big fight here is between independence and dependence, between
citizens and monopolies (or duopolies), between local
initiatives&mdash;backed in many cases by local governments&mdash;and some of the nastiest
state and federal politics you're ever going to find. In every case, the
protagonists are individuals, local groups, local companies, local
governments and local utilities.
</p><p>
The problem they face is a combination of duopoly entrenchment and
well-lobbied protection at the federal and state levels. The telcos
alone are the biggest-spending lobbying group in US history&mdash;even bigger
than the pharmaceuticals. And, they don't just work Congress. Some
carriers are working at the state level to make it against the law for
anybody to carry the Internet other than themselves.
</p><p>
Linux folks can help enormously here, because Linux techies&mdash;our
readers&mdash;know how to build good, strong, reliable, easily fixed and
easily improved solutions. And, they know how to do it on the cheap. We've been
watering grass roots for up to two decades or more. Stallman taught us
what freedom means, and Torvalds taught us how to have fun putting it to
use. We have a lot of leverage.

Mobile: the Ultimate User Space</h2></div></div><p>
Sometime this year there will be more than three billion mobile phones in the
world. To put that in perspective (relying on last month's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Index),
compare that to 1.4 billion credit cards, 1.3 billion land lines, 1.1
billion Net connections, 800 million cars, 200 million computer games,
100 million PVRs and 85 million iPods.
</p><p>
Cell phones are networked computing devices. A growing percentage of
them run on Linux. Yet the OpenMoko (<a href="http://openmoko.com" target="_self">openmoko.com</a>) and
Trolltech's Qtopia Greenphone
(<a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qtopia/greenphone" target="_self">www.trolltech.com/products/qtopia/greenphone</a>), both wide-open
working prototypes, are rarities. They face an enormous uphill battle
against silo'd alliances between cell service carriers and equipment
makers, such as Nokia and Motorola.
</p><p>
Yet the world needs open phones. In fact, I'd hazard a prophesy that
open phones are inevitable, because there will be far more money to be
made <span   class="emphasis"><em>because of</em></span> open phones than will ever be made
<span   class="emphasis"><em>with</em></span> closed ones
(and closed services offered only by carriers). We're starting to see
vertical cracks in the closed wall of mobile telephony in settings such
as universities, where rogue companies like Rave Wireless (disclosure: I
consult them) provide students with custom (based on open) phones that
run on familiar networks (such as Cingular and T-Mobile), but that do far more
than the closed phones sold at stores by those same networks. Users are
even free to do their own programming, create and add their own features
and services. With each crack of this kind in a vertical market, the
chance improves that open phones will become the norm rather than the
exception.
</p><p>
The protagonists here are Linux techies, but working a much larger world
of possibilities. The problem, as ever, is less a matter of closed
systems than of the mentality behind it.
</p><p>
Once markets start to open up, it will be easy to fill whole magazine
issues with stories of clever hacks and deployment successes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e1580.0x26da3c8"></a>
Desktop and Laptop Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Desktop Linux has been approaching without ever arriving since the
mid-1990s. Most <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers are there already, of course. But
they're wizards. The muggles are still on Windows and Mac boxes. What
we've needed for the duration is one or more of the major hardware OEMs
to wake up and smell the volume. Last year, Lenovo began selling
Linux-loaded ThinkPads in a committed way, but not aggressively. Lenovo
didn't push it. This year, Dell set out bait in the form of IdeaStorm, a
site that had all the look of a &ldquo;conversational&rdquo; marketing ploy, but
instead served as a hole in the Windows-only dike that has been holding
the Linux desktop river outside of Dell's headquarters for the duration.
That hole quickly widened to a river of its own, flooding through Dell's
product development system. (See the IdeaStorm story in this issue's UpFront.)
</p><p>
I'd love to be a fly on the wall when Michael Dell tells Steve Ballmer
that Dell will be selling Linux-branded laptops and desktops in a much
more public way, because the company has no choice: the market demands it.
</p><p>
HP, Sony and the rest won't be far behind. As the volume grows, so will
the portfolio of applications and the sum of expertise about Linux
desktops and laptops.
</p><p>
This is a category that will explode very quickly. I'm willing to bet
right now that in June 2008, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> will have an unavoidably
personal focus to every issue&mdash;for the simple reason that there will
be too much going on with desktops and laptops.
</p><p>
Or maybe not. We don't know yet. Lenovo, HP and Dell may continue
quietly to fill orders for desktop Linux without ever marketing it
aggressively. This won't go on forever, but the asymptote may still stay
flat for another year, two or three.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, desktop and laptop Linux are still worth fighting for, just
like we've been doing for the last decade or more.

DIY Everything</h2></div></div><p>
I have a confession to make. Or a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Make</em></span> to confess. I
love <span   class="emphasis"><em>Make</em></span>
magazine. I wish we'd done something like that first. Kudos to Dale
Daugherty and the O'Reilly folks for pulling that one off and doing a
great job with it&mdash;also for not running too much Linux-type stuff in there.
</p><p>
When I started with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> in the late 1990s, we were basically a
how-to magazine. To a large degree, we still are. Most of our readers are
hands-on types in any case. Problem solvers. Most of our writers (myself
excluded) are too.
</p><p>
So I'm wondering...now that Linux is (or can be) in nearly everything,
what can we make or fix that's one or more layers up? What can we do
with MythTV that's beyond a set-top box? Pluto is a cool (and
Linux-based) whole-home automation, security, entertainment and telecom
system. But, it's still a system. A deep and under-appreciated (and
under-deployed) virtue of openness is modularity. You want to be able to
mix and match different stuff from different makers, including
(especially) yourself. We should be making Legos with Linux, not just
embedding it in finished closed products that work only with themselves.
</p><p>
Here the fight is for the right and ability to build what you want, any
way you want to build it. Although <span   class="emphasis"><em>Make</em></span> is oriented toward doing fun
hacks on already-made stuff (turning a mouse into a robot or adding
temperature control to a coffeemaker), we'd angle more toward making
the modules, and the things-with-modules that allow anybody to build
anything. Our protagonists would be the same DIY-ers we've had all
along, but the problem would be Building Anything. Fun problem.
</p><p>
Years ago, I talked about how the software industry was turning into a
construction industry&mdash;when architects, designers, builders and their
specialties would all be independent of any one company's platform or
development environment. Now we're almost there, but not quite. The fight
here is to make Linux and its endless variety of &ldquo;stacks&rdquo; into the base
materials with which people can put together using their own virtual
Home Depots.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25e1580.0x26dac08"></a>
Freedom vs. Control</h2></div></div><p>
Although it's easy to point to the exemplary successes of Linux-built
giants such as Google and Amazon, it's just as easy to overlook the degree
to which the practical value system behind Linux development has become
the default approach to networked progress.
</p><p>
Yet even as Linux and the LAMP+ stack have become standard building
materials, there's nothing to stop them from being used in service of a
proprietary mentality that seeks to lock in customers, lock out
competition and lock down markets. As Steven Hodson puts it
(<a href="http://www.winextra.com/?p=354" target="_self">www.winextra.com/?p=354</a>): 
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Many would like to believe that the
best and strongest weapon against the old guard of technology is the
Open Source movement, but what they don't see is that they have already
been co-opted and have just become another way to make money. While the
roots of the OSM (Open Source movement) may still technically be free to
all, the old guard is quickly locking up parts of it with service
contracts and corporate licensing.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
It's still customary for VCs to ask their potential portfolio companies,
&ldquo;What's your lock-in?&rdquo; This is an Industrial Age mentality that needs to
be exposed as a value-subtracting anachronism in a world where creation
and choice yield abundances that can be put to countless productive
uses. You should want to build goods and provide services that customers
choose freely. You should keep customers because they want to stay, not
because you've trapped them in a silo.
</p><p>
Even Steve Jobs this year came out and said the record industry would be
better off without DRM. That's because he's no less trapped than any of
his customers.
</p><p>
The protagonist here is nothing less than the cause of freedom, which
will never be old Gnus. (Pun intended.) The problem here&mdash;the
enemy&mdash;is a mentality that's as old as the Industrial Age.
</p><p>
The battle for freedom, of course, is one we've been fighting all along.
The difference now is that the logic of lockup is more and more
exposed, and its flaws are more and more evident&mdash;though not yet widely
obvious.
</p><p>
The fight, then, will shift from ideals to practical matters. How do you
make money by building with free stuff and putting it to use, rather
than just by selling it? How is software more useful and important as it
becomes less and less of an industry? How do you get more work done, and
become more valuable as a contributor because you're working with free
and open goods?
</p><p>
These are still new questions, even though <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> has been a
living answer to all of them since 1994.
