<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #158, June 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Ingo Molnar</b></span> has implemented a new language-like wrapper system called
<span   class="bold"><b>Syslets</b></span> to manage system calls from user space. These little mini-programs
can run system calls asynchronously, responding to their behavior as the
user desires, without having to return out of kernel space. Using Syslet
wrappers, Ingo has measured 33.9% speedups over cached synchronous I/O and
19.2% speedups over uncached synchronous I/O. Interest in Syslets among
kernel hackers is fairly high, though <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> feels the Syslet
programming interface is too complicated and difficult for casual users
to experiment with. Clearly some work remains before Syslets are ready to go
into the main tree.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> has produced a <span   class="bold"><b>PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection</b></span> adapter driver.
Unlike some other Intel drivers, this one doesn't depend on a proprietary
d&aelig;mon; it is fully open source. It does, however, require a microcode
upgrade. This improved licensing situation is apparently not due to any
different feature of the hardware, but rather is due to improvements in the
microcode itself. Intel's driver has received a good reaction among kernel
folks, and it seems on the way to being included in the source tree.
</p><p>
The well-known and long-standing <span   class="bold"><b>\0
loophole</b></span>, allowing drivers to pretend
to be GPLed when they aren't, is being closed. Several folks are working on
this, most notably <span   class="bold"><b>Jan Engelhardt</b></span>, who recently posted a patch to fix it.
There's a controversy surrounding this patch, because some folks feel that
if the kernel places greater restrictions on non-GPLed drivers than on GPLed
ones, this constitutes a license enforcement feature, which could violate
the terms of the GNU General Public License. So long as the loophole exists
within the code, the debate can stay dormant, because driver writers can
bypass the controls. Once the controls actually start to work, the debate
gains immediacy for companies such as <span   class="bold"><b>LinuxAnt</b></span>, who have made use of the
loophole in the past.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>KVM virtual machine code</b></span> has migrated its development tree from
Subversion to git for a couple reasons. <span   class="bold"><b>Avi
Kivity</b></span> said, by way of
explanation, that Subversion could not efficiently host the entire kernel
tree and that developers wanted to maintain their own branches
independently.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jon Masters</b></span> is the new <span   class="bold"><b>module-init-tools</b></span> maintainer, having taken over the
job from <span   class="bold"><b>Rusty Russell</b></span> and patched the
<span   class="bold"><b>MAINTAINERS file</b></span> to reflect the
change. <span   class="bold"><b>Evgeniy Dushistov</b></span> also has
created a <span   class="bold"><b>UFS entry</b></span> in the MAINTAINERS
file, and listed himself as the maintainer.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alessandro Di Marco</b></span> got more than he
bargained for when he posted a new <span   class="bold"><b>user
inactivity trigger</b></span> he's been playing around with. It's a nice little feature
that issues an ACPI event when no user activity occurs for a certain amount
of time. He'd hammered the code out for fun, intentionally avoiding
questions about optimal implementation details, on the assumption that not
too many folks actually would be interested in this work. As it turned out,
a lot of folks were interested, and they had many implementation suggestions.
For starters, <span   class="bold"><b>Arjan van de Ven</b></span> pointed out that uevent would be a better
delivery mechanism than ACPI. <span   class="bold"><b>Pavel
Machek</b></span> pointed out that Alessandro's new
/proc file would be better in the /sys directory. Pavel also suggested that
user space would be a better place overall for such a feature, although
Alessandro feels this would add a lot of complexity to the code. He
responded quickly to a lot of the suggestions, producing new versions of his
patch that answered the objections raised on the linux-kernel mailing
list.
</p><p>
Planning for the next <span   class="bold"><b>Linux Kernel
Summit</b></span> has begun. The kernel folks are
spicing it up with a move to Cambridge, England, instead of the traditional
Ottawa gathering in Canada. The new venue has opened up the possibility of
different venues in the future, and a bunch of them have been proposed,
including Australia, India and the Czech Republic. A major factor in
selecting future locations will be the overall cost. A lot of kernel folks
work at companies that pay for their plane tickets to the Summit each year,
but some prices become prohibitive. Countries that are home to more
attendees are more likely to host the Summit than others, according to
<span   class="bold"><b>Theodore Y. Ts'o</b></span>, one of the organizers. But of course, anything can happen.

<h2 class="title">This Issue of <span class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Dedicated to John Backus</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Jon "maddog" Hall</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #158, June 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I had written and submitted this month's Beachhead column, with a
slant toward this issue's theme of computer languages, and in particular,
the language FORTRAN, which was the first computer language I ever
learned. And, although in my column I pointed out the benefit of learning
machine and assembly language, I honestly do not believe that I would
have gone into the programming field if it were not for FORTRAN.
</p><p>
On March 20, 2007, two weeks after I submitted the article, I got the very
sad news of the March 17th death of John Backus. John was the man who
people credit as the &ldquo;Father of FORTRAN&rdquo;, and one of two people credited
with Backus-Naur Form, a language invented to describe languages. I
sent the message out to my local Linux user group, and during the next
week it appeared again and again in various mailing lists.
</p><p>
With today's languages and computers, it is hard for people to know or
(for those of us old enough) even to remember those early days. Today,
concepts we take for granted were both revolutionary and difficult in
conception in those days. There were people who thought computers
would never be able to be programmed in anything other than machine
code, and I am sure that John and his staff met more than their share of
skeptics, but they persevered. And, out of the work they did on the
first successful high-level language came many more successes by many
more people on many more languages.
</p><p>
So I asked <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> to dedicate this issue devoted to
languages to
John Backus: Computer Scientist Extraordinaire and Humanitarian,
1924&ndash;2007.
</p><p>
And, as we contribute our pieces to the future of computer science, may
we hope someday in our own way to contribute as much as he did.

<h2 class="title">IdeaStorm: Hardware OEM Learnings of Linux for Make Benefit Glorious Company of Dellstan</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #158, June 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Early this year, Dell created a Digg-like site called Dell | IdeaStorm
(&ldquo;Where Your Ideas Reign&rdquo;). The idea was for readers to submit ideas for
the company, then have other readers vote and comment on them. Next to
the title logo ran hints, such as &ldquo;How can technology companies address
climate change?&rdquo; (over &ldquo;click here to Read Dell's point of
view&rdquo;).
Needless to say, this opened the floodgates holding back a tide of Linux
demand.
</p><p>
As of 8am CDT on March 13, 2007, here were the top ten vote-getters:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
108,886 votes: &ldquo;Pre-Installed Linux | Ubuntu | Fedora |
OpenSUSE | Multi-Boot&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
73,840 votes: &ldquo;Pre-Installed OpenOffice.org | alternative to MS
Works &amp; MS Office&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
54,300 votes: &ldquo;Stripped down, fast Linux box&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
50,653 votes: &ldquo;Have Firefox pre-installed as default
browser&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
49,990 votes: &ldquo;No OS preloaded&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
51,048 votes: &ldquo;NO EXTRA SOFTWARE OPTION&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
35,867 votes: &ldquo;Provide Linux drivers for all your
hardware&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
29,041 votes: &ldquo;Linux 2.6.16 ready (sticker)&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
20,288 votes: &ldquo;National Call Centers&rdquo;
</p></li><li><p>
17,376 votes: &ldquo;LinuxBIOS instead of proprietary BIOS&rdquo;
</p></li></ol></div><p>
One hour later, Dell added two more posts of its own. On the IdeaStorm
page, it posted &ldquo;Linux&mdash;We're listening&mdash;Now Tell Us
More&rdquo;. On the
Direct2Dell.com page, it added &ldquo;Dell to Expand Linux
Options&rdquo;. Both
pointed to a survey at <a href="http://www.dell.com/linuxsurvey" target="_self">www.dell.com/linuxsurvey</a>. The survey was
also titled &ldquo;Linux Learnings: We're Listening&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Hence the headline above.

One of the fun uses to which Google puts its vast Linux server farms can
be found at <a href="http://trends.google.com" target="_self">trends.google.com</a>.
Here you can see and compare queries for keywords over a period of time
that runs from the end of 2003 to the present.
</p><p>
In addition to showing trends on a graph, Google Trends also shows the
top ten places from which queries come. This brings up some surprising
results.
</p><p>
See if you can match the search terms on the left with the top search
query locations on the right.

You've gotta like an MP3 player that goes out of its way to play OGG and
brag about its Linux-friendliness (the literature says &ldquo;Linux from
kernel 2.4.x&rdquo;). That would explain why TrekStor's Vibez player has been
getting some nice buzz in Linux circles.

</p><p>
Upsides: you can load it as a plain USB storage device. It plays back
OGG (plus MP3, WAV, FLAC and WMA). It has line-in and microphone
recording, a color display, a USB-chargeable battery (plus a spare),
device-deletion of files, adjustable play speed and a very slick
non-iPod design. It's the size of a soap bar&mdash;4"x2"x.7", with
highly rounded corners. And, it's a lot lighter&mdash;only 2.5 ounces.
</p><p>
Downside: not a lot of storage. Ranges from 8&ndash;15GB at prices that
start at around $200 US.
