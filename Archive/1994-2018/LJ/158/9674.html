Just what do you have to do to type those special characters
anyhow?

Fran&ccedil;ois, our guests will be here soon. What are you doing?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span>
You are learning a language for this issue's theme? You might have picked
a better time to study, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, but I applaud you nonetheless. What
language did you choose to learn? PHP? C++? Python? You chose Spanish? I
am sorry, Fran&ccedil;ois, I am not laughing at you, I am just laughing
in general. This issue isn't supposed to be about human languages;
it's about computer languages. Now, don't fret. Let's hear a line of
Spanish. You speak Spanish very good. Did you learn it from a book? Now,
now, Fran&ccedil;ois, I promise. No more <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fawlty Towers</em></span> jokes. Besides, our
guests will be here any moment. Head down to the cellar and bring back
the 2003 Errazuriz Don Maximiano Cabernet from Chile. I'll finish getting
the tables ready. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span>
</p><p>
Ah, welcome everyone, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of exquisite
wines and super open-source software. Please, sit and make yourselves
comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois has gone to fetch the wine and will be back
shortly. I have decided to make some last-minute changes to the menu
in honor of my faithful waiter's well-meaning intentions. Tonight's menu
will feature languages, or at least, dealing with the special characters
that make up many languages.
</p><p>
Even if you don't speak any language other than English, there will
be times when you find yourself needing to enter a special accented
letter or character into your writing. This is particularly true if
your name contains a letter with an accent at the end of it, as my
own last name does. Sure, I could keep a document with these letters already
written, handy and open on my desktop, select the letters, copy them and
finally, paste that &eacute; into my text, but doing so can become amazingly
time consuming.
</p><p>
If, like me, you spend a lot of time working with OpenOffice.org's word
processor, Writer, the solution is fairly simple. Click Insert on the
menu bar and select Special Characters from the drop-down menu. A window
labeled Special Characters appears (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9674f1.large.jpg"><img src="9674f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. OpenOffice.org
provides a dialog for entering special characters into your documents.
</p></div></div><p>
From the dialog, you can select your font and international character
set&mdash;North and South Americans, Australians and most Europeans will
work with the Latin subset. All in all, this is great solution, except
that it works only with OpenOffice.org running and requires you to open
the dialog every time you want to enter a special character. Furthermore,
not all applications have a handy list of characters from which to choose. There
are several ways to get around this problem, and I show you a few of
them now.
</p><p>
Let's start with some KDE solutions. Fire up kcontrol,
the KDE Control Center. Under Regional &amp; Accessibility, select the
submenu for Keyboard Layout. On the right-hand pane, you'll see a
number of flags from different countries. Click Enable keyboard
layouts to un-gray these choices. If you installed your system using
US English as your language of choice, the default is to provide you
with US English. Because my background is French Canadian rather than
French from France, I am most familiar with a North American keyboard
layout, including the French Canadian keyboard (I honestly have no idea
how a French keyboard in France is laid out). Consequently, I always add
Canada to that list (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9674f2.large.jpg"><img src="9674f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. From the KDE
Control Center, you can assign additional keyboard layouts.
</p></div></div><p>
When you click OK or Apply, a little icon that looks like a tiny flag
appears in your icon tray. Clicking that icon switches between the
various layouts (of which there are two at the moment). When you are on
the alternate layout (for example, Canada), pressing different keys
causes
whatever character from the keyboard layout that the map presents to appear. This may require some
experimentation on your part so you can discover what each key
does&mdash;unless, of course, you happen to be familiar with your chosen layout.
</p><p>
In order to continue working normally, click the tray
icon another time to switch back to the US English keyboard layout. This
switching back and forth, however, isn't for everyone, and taking the
time to learn an alternate keyboard layout when you need only the
occasional character may not be the best approach. Another way around
this problem is to use a tool called KCharSelect. You generally can find
it in your KDE Utilities menu, but you also can run it with the command
<tt  >kcharselect</tt>. When the program starts, a table of all 256
available characters in your current locale appear (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9674f3.large.jpg"><img src="9674f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. KCharSelect is like
a buffet table for special characters.
</p></div></div><p>
Select a font from the drop-down list at top. Then, if necessary, select
an alternate character table (the Latin set is at 0 on my system). If
you hover your mouse pointer over a character, you'll see its Unicode
and ASCII value. To use a character in an application (such as e-mail),
click on that character, and it will appear in the text field at the
bottom of the dialog. You even can enter multiple characters if you
want. To use what you have selected, click the To Clipboard button, and
then paste the result into your application of choice.
</p><p>
A similar application called Gucharmap exists for users of the GNOME desktop. 
You likely can find it under the Accessories submenu by
clicking the Applications button on the top GNOME panel (as it is
under my Ubuntu test system). The program name is
<tt  >gucharmap</tt>
if you want to run it directly. When the window appears (Figure 4),
you'll see that the concept is similar to the KDE KCharSelect tool, but
there are some interesting differences. From the left-hand sidebar,
select your character set or script (Latin, for most of us here), choose
a font, then double-click on the character you want from the main
display pane on the right. When you do so, that character appears in the
Text to copy field at the bottom of the dialog. Click the Copy button,
then paste the text into whatever application you are currently running.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9674f4.large.jpg"><img src="9674f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Gucharmap is a
great GNOME way to select special characters.
</p></div></div><p>
Tools like KCharSelect and Gucharmap are wonderful to have at your
disposal, but for some people, there is only an occasional need for entering
special characters. As such, these programs seem to live a little large
on the desktop, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non?</em></span> A tiny application, an applet that lives
in your panel, might be more to taste for those of us who 
need to enter only a small number of characters. In the KDE environment,
there are many applets, and one of these, the Character Selector, may
be just what you need.
</p><p>
To add the applet, right-click on a blank section of your Kicker panel,
and select Add Applet to Panel. The Add Applet dialog appears with a list of programs you can use to populate your Kicker panel 
(Figure 5). Each program (or applet) is listed alphabetically with a
short description. Look for the Character Selector. To add the applet,
simply click the Add to Panel button.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9674f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Adding
applets to the KDE Kicker panel.
</p></div></div><p>
Your Kicker panel now should have a box containing a handful of special
characters&mdash;12 by default. To use one of these characters in your
text, simply single-click the character of your choice, and paste it into your
application. It's that easy. That said, the set of characters provided
by the application may not be quite what <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> want. To change that,
right-click on the applet's handle (that little bar with the arrow to
the left of the applet), and select Configure Character Selector from
the pop-up menu. A configuration window appears above the applet
(Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9674f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. By adding the
Character Selector to your Kicker panel, special characters are always
handy.
</p></div></div><p>
Modify the character list to suit your taste or need, then click
OK. You may want to use KCharSelect, just this once, to paste in your list
of characters.
</p><p>
Those of you who are running GNOME as your default desktop environment
have a similar tool at your disposal, and it also is an applet. Right-click
on the bottom (or top) panel and select Add to Panel. A window of the
same name appears with a list of available applets (Figure 7). Scroll
down until you see the Utilities section. There you will find an applet
named Character Palette. Select it, then click Add or simply drag the
applet to the panel in the location of your choice.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9674f7.large.jpg"><img src="9674f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Add the
GNOME Character Palette panel applet.
</p></div></div><p>
You will see a row of characters appear on your panel with a drop-down
arrow to the left of those characters. To use any of these characters in
a document (or e-mail message or chat session or other application) click the character of your
choice, then paste it into your application. If you don't see the character
you need, there's a good chance it already has been defined for
you. All you need to do is switch palettes. Click the down arrow, and
a selection of more than 20 predefined palettes appear; simply
click to switch. As rich as this selection is, it still is possible that
the characters you need on a day-to-day basis are not there. To edit the
palette or add to it, right-click on the down arrow and select Preferences
from the submenu. The Character Palette Preferences dialog appears
(Figure 8).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9674f8.large.jpg"><img src="9674f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. So many special
characters, so little time.
</p></div></div><p>
From this dialog, you can choose to edit a current palette, delete
a palette or create something entirely new. To create a new palette,
click the Add button and enter the characters into the dialog window that
appears&mdash;of course, you may need to paste them from another
character application, such as Gucharmap or OpenOffice.org.
</p><p>
Now, when Fran&ccedil;ois becomes a master of Spanish, he will be able to
enter all the Spanish characters he wants. In the meantime,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, it appears that it is nearly time to bid you all
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Adieu</em></span>. Nearly, being the key word, or as Fran&ccedil;ois might now say it,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>casi</em></span>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> You plan on
learning Japanese next week? Why not.
Until next time, please raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>,
and let us all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
