Speed up your Web applications with SCGI.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x12a5240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you're operating a Web server, chances are, you're not merely
serving up static text and images. You're likely to be running some
Web applications as well, where pages are generated on the fly by
some program or script using CGI (Common Gateway Interface). Think
of blogging software, bug trackers, news sites and content management
systems&mdash;anything that turns the browser from a document viewer into
a user interface. And, you probably write or at least tweak some of
these yourself.
</p><p>
This article shows how to build faster Web applications
using an alternative to CGI called SCGI (Simple Common
Gateway Interface). SCGI is a protocol, not just a program, but its
authors also provide a reference implementation, which is what we
use here. It includes modules to use SCGI from Apache or lighttpd and
Python classes to help you create SCGI applications. Implementations in
other languages are available, but we examine the combination
of Apache 2.x and Python here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x12a5450"></a>
Where Does the Time Go?</h2></div></div><p>
Normally, a Web application runs briefly, but very frequently, in child
processes of the Web server. When a client requests a page, the Web
server consults its configuration and finds that the request should go
to the application. It delegates the request to a child process, which
in turn loads and runs the application program. The program may be a
binary or a script in Perl, Python or PHP, shell commands, or just about
anything else. The CGI standard defines how the program receives details
about the request, including requested URL, requested body, authenticated
user identity and originating IP address. The program reads these,
produces a page in answer to the client's request, and exits. All this
happens again at the next request.
</p><p>
Loading, running and exiting programs can be costly. It does make sense
for sloppy programs: they may use memory without ever freeing it up again,
for instance. In that case, you want the program to run briefly and
then let the operating system clean up after it. But, with today's popular
languages&mdash;Perl, Python, PHP, Java and shell scripts&mdash;there really aren't many
problems with this. A well-written application really should be able to
handle multiple requests in a single run.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x12a55b0"></a>
Faster Service with SCGI</h2></div></div><p>
SCGI lets your program start once and continue servicing requests for as
long as it likes. It works like this: a separate server process, called
an SCGI server, runs separately from the Web server and manages one Web
application. The Web server forwards all requests for that application
to the application's SCGI server. It passes on details about the request
in much the same form as in regular CGI.
</p><p>
The SCGI server delegates the request to a child process, just like the
Web server did with a regular CGI application. The child process also
runs the application, but that's where the similarity ends. Instead of
exiting after it's done with that one request, the application can 
sit and wait for a new one. Each of the SCGI server's child processes
runs one instance of the application, each sleeping until there is work
for it to do.
</p><p>
The SCGI server spawns a new child process when none are available to
take on the latest request&mdash;up to a configurable maximum, of course. It
also cleans up crashing or exiting child processes, so your Web
application can still bail out if things go wrong. But, most of the
time, when a request arrives, the application is ready and waiting for
it. That's why Ruby on Rails, the Web application framework, comes with
the option to run on SCGI; it would be too slow otherwise.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x12a57c0"></a>
Other Advantages</h2></div></div><p>
If the speedup isn't enough for you, there's more. The SCGI server process
can be running on the same system as the Web server, but it doesn't have
to be. You can offload the server by delegating some Web applications
to separate systems, preferably behind a firewall where only the Web
server can access them.
</p><p>
Even with just a single server, you can use SCGI to contain
vulnerabilities. A normal CGI application starts out running under the
same user identity as the Web server process. If an attacker manages to
subvert a normal CGI application, your entire Web site may be at risk. An
SCGI server, on the other hand, can run under its own user identity, so
it can't easily affect the Web server or other applications even if it
does run amok. Conversely, you don't need to give the Web server access
to the application's code or data anymore; only the application as run
by the SCGI server needs access. Everyone else must go through the Web
server, which in turn talks to the SCGI server.
</p><p>
You also can run an application in a chroot environment or a virtualized
server. With CGI, that quickly becomes expensive and hard to manage.
When using SCGI, you start only one server process in your isolated
environment&mdash;whether it's a chroot jail, a virtualized server, a different user
identity or another machine&mdash;and the entire application will stay there.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x12a59d0"></a>
Installing SCGI</h2></div></div><p>
You need two components: the Python classes for building SCGI
applications and a module for your Web server to make it &ldquo;speak
SCGI&rdquo;
to the applications. If you use Red Hat package management (RPM), you
can install these using <tt  >yum install python-scgi
apache2-mod_scgi</tt>; users
of Debian's apt can use <tt  >apt-get install python-scgi
libapache2-mod-scgi</tt>.
</p><p>
You also can install either component by hand. The Apache module requires
a C compiler and Apache's apxs script. Some distributions keep
apxs in a separate development package rather than installing it as part
of the regular Apache package.
</p><p>
Assuming you now have those components, next download the source tarball
scgi-1.12.tar.gz,
and run the commands shown in Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x12a5c90"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

sudo python setup.py install
# Now build and install the Apache module

# Enable the SCGI module in Apache. This may fail,
# depending on your Apache version, but no matter.

# Make Apache's new configuration take effect
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload
</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x12a5ea0"></a>
Test Run</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's make sure it all works. The Python package is a module with
some classes, and normally, you'd write your application as a program that
imports that module. For debugging, however, you also can run it as a
standalone application. When it receives a request from the Web server,
it simply prints the request's details as a text page. Perfect for a first
test&mdash;no coding required!
</p><p>
Find the scgi_server.py module on your system. It should be installed
in /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/scgi (the 2.4 may be 2.3 or
2.5 on your system). Then, run the module:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/scgi
python scgi_server.py
</pre>
</p><p>
This listens for requests from the Web server on a TCP port on your
system, using port 4000 by default. You can make it listen on a different port
by passing the desired port number as a command-line argument, such as:


<pre     class="programlisting">
python /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/scgi/scgi_server.py 63000
</pre>
</p><p>
The
module keeps running until you kill it, so start it in a separate
shell. Remember, you don't need to run an SCGI server as root
or even under the Web server's identity.
</p><p>
Now that the SCGI application is waiting for requests, pick a location
on your Web site to delegate to the application. Let's say
you want it to answer all requests for &ldquo;/scgitest&rdquo; on this server. Write
an Apache configuration snippet, as shown in Listing 2, to a new file in
/etc/apache2/conf.d.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x12a62c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. Apache Configuration Snippet</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

# Load the SCGI module. This is really only needed
# if you installed manually and the "a2enmod scgi"
# command failed.
LoadModule scgi_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_scgi.so

&lt;Location "/scgitest"&gt;
    # Enable SCGI
    SCGIHandler On
    # Other properties for /scgitest, such as access
    # control
    # ...
&lt;/Location&gt;

# Hostname and port number where SCGI server for
# /scgitest is running.
# Port 4000 on localhost (127.0.0.1) is the default.
SCGIMount /scgitest 127.0.0.1:4000

</pre></div><p>
The SCGI server doesn't really need to run on the same machine as the Web
server, as you can see here. Simply make sure that the SCGI server's port is
properly firewalled, so that only your Web server can reach it! That way,
your application can be sure that all CGI parameters have been validated
by the Web server first. If an attacker could connect directly to your
SCGI application, you wouldn't be able to trust that information. The
CGI parameter AUTHENTICATED_USER, for instance, tells your application
that the request comes from a particular logged-in user. You can believe
that only if you hear it from a properly configured Web server.
</p><p>
Make Apache reload its configuration with <tt  >sudo /etc/init.d/apache2
reload</tt>. Your server should now serve a new location, /scgitest, that
simply prints your request's CGI parameters when you access it. Verify this
by looking it up in a browser. If your server's address is example.org,
point your browser at http://example.org/scgitest. You should see a page
that looks like Listing 3.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x12a65d8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

If that's not what you see, take a look at the shell where you ran
the module. It may have printed some helpful error message there. Or,
if there is no reaction from the SCGI server whatsoever, the request
may not have reached it in the first place; check the Apache error log.
</p><p>
Once you have this running, congratulations&mdash;the worst is behind you.
Stop your SCGI server process so it doesn't interfere with what we're
going to do next.

Writing an Application</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's write a simple SCGI application in Python&mdash;one that
prints the time.
</p><p>
We import the SCGI Python modules, then write our application as a
handler for SCGI requests coming in through the Web server. The
handler takes the form of a class that we derive from SCGIHandler. Call
me unimaginative, but I've called the example handler class
TimeHandler. We'll fill in the actual code in a moment, but begin
with this skeleton:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#! /usr/bin/python
import scgi
import scgi.scgi_server

class TimeHandler(scgi.scgi_server.SCGIHandler):
    pass  # (no code here yet)

# Main program: create an SCGIServer object to
# listen on port 4000.  We tell the SCGIServer the
# handler class that implements our application.
server = scgi.scgi_server.SCGIServer(
    handler_class=TimeHandler,
    port=4000
    )
# Tell our SCGIServer to start servicing requests.
# This loops forever.
server.serve()
</pre>
</p><p>
You may think it strange that we must pass the SCGIServer our handler
class, rather than a handler object. The reason is that server object
will create handler objects of our given class as needed.
</p><p>
This first incarnation of TimeHandler is still essentially the same as the
original SCGIHandler, so all it does is print out request parameters. To
see this in action, try running this program and opening the scgitest
page in your browser as before. You should see something like Listing
3 again.
</p><p>
Now, we want to print the time in a form that a
browser will understand. We can't simply start sending text or HTML;
we first must emit an HTTP header that tells the browser what kind of
output to expect. In this case, let's stick with simple text. Add the
following near the top of your program, right above the TimeHandler class definition:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import time
def print_time(outfile):
    # HTTP header describing the page we're about
    # to produce. Must end with double MS-DOS-style
    # "CR/LF" end-of-line sequence. In Python, that
    # translates to "\r\n.
    outfile.write("Content-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\n")

    # Now write our page: the time, in plain text
    outfile.write(time.ctime() + "\n")
</pre>
</p><p>
By now, you're probably wondering how we will make our handler class call
this function. With SCGI 1.12 or newer, it's easy. We can write a method
TimeHandler.produce() to override SCGIHandler's default action:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class TimeHandler(scgi.scgi_server.SCGIHandler):
    # (remove the "pass" statement--we've got real
    # code here now)

    # This is where we receive requests:
    def produce(self, env, bodysize, input, output):
        # Do our work: write page with the time to output
        print_time(output)
</pre>
</p><p>
We ignore them here, but produce() takes several arguments: env is a
dict mapping CGI parameter names to their values. Next, bodysize is the
size in bytes of the request body or payload. If you're interested in
the request body, read up to bodysize bytes from the following argument,
input. Finally, output is the file that we write our output page to.
</p><p>
If you have SCGI 1.11 or older, you need some wrapper code to make
this work. In these older versions, you override a different method,
SCGIHandler.handle_connection(), and do more of the work yourself. Simply
copy the boilerplate code from Listing 4 into the TimeHandler class. It
will set things up right and call produce(), so nothing else changes,
and we can write produce() exactly as if we had a newer version of SCGI.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x129d5a0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 4. Boilerplate Code for SCGI 1.11 or Older</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
  # Insert this definition into your handler class:
class TimeHandler(scgi.scgi_server.SCGIHandler):

    # ...

    def handle_connection(self, conn):
        input = conn.makefile("r")
        output = conn.makefile("w")
        env = self.read_env(input)
        bodysize = int(env.get('CONTENT_LENGTH',0))
        try:
            self.produce(env,bodysize,input,output)
        finally:
            output.close()
            input.close()
            conn.close()
</pre></div><p>
Once again, run the application and check that it shows the time in
your browser.
</p><p>
Next, to make things more interesting, let's pass some arguments to the
request and have the program process them. The convention for arguments
to Web applications is to tack a question mark onto the URL, followed by a
series of arguments separated by ampersands. Each argument is of the form
name=value. If we wanted to pass the program a parameter called pizza
with the value hawaii, and another one called drink with the value
beer, our URL would look something like
http://example.org/scgitest?pizza=hawaii&amp;drink=beer.
</p><p>
Any arguments that the visitor passes to the program end up in the
single CGI parameter QUERY_STRING. In this case, the parameter would read
&ldquo;pizza=hawaii&amp;drink=beer&rdquo;. Here's something our TimeHandler might do
with that:


<pre     class="programlisting">

class TimeHandler(scgi.scgi_server.SCGIHandler):
    def produce(self, env, bodysize, input, output)
        # Read arguments
        argstring = env['QUERY_STRING']
        # Break argument string into list of
        # pairs like "name=value"
        arglist = argstring.split('&amp;')

        # Set up dictionary mapping argument names
        # to values
        args = {}
        for arg in arglist:
          (key, value) = arg.split('=')
          args[key] = value

        # Print time, as before, but with a bit of
        # extra advice
        print_time(output)
        output.write(
         "Time for a pizza. I'll have the %s and a swig of %s!\n" %
         (args['pizza'], args['drink'])
        )

</pre>
</p><p>
Now the application we wrote will not only print the time, but also suggest
a pizza and drink as passed in the URL. Try it! You also can experiment
with the other CGI parameters in Listing 3 to find more things your
SCGI applications can do.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x129da18"></a>
Porting Applications</h2></div></div><p>
Once you're comfortable writing programs using SCGI, you may want to try
adapting existing applications to use it. Some well-known Web applications,
such as MoinMoin (a wiki) and Trac (a wiki-based collaborative development
environment), are implemented as Python modules. Both of these examples
come with CGI scripts in Python that can be called from Apache. The CGI
scripts are very short; they really don't do anything except import the
application's modules and invoke a function on them.
</p><p>
If you find an application like that, all you really need to do to
make it work with SCGI is take that little bit of Python code and move
it into a produce() method, as in the examples you've seen here. If you have
SCGI 1.12 or newer, you also might want to take a look at an alternative
SCGIHandler method, produce_cgilike().
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ad580.0x129db78"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
That's about all we have room for. If you wonder about how the CGI
parameters work, try looking at the CGI standard, which calls them
&ldquo;request meta-variables&rdquo; (see Resources).
</p><p>
Finally, a word of warning. You'll notice that the last example program
dies horribly if you fail to pass the expected arguments. The SCGI
server replaces the failing processes, so in this case, there's
no real problem. But, this should remind you how careful you need to be
when writing Web applications. Never trust the input you receive from
outside! If a program can be crashed, someone can probably subvert it or
take it out of action. People all over the world do that sort of thing
for fun or profit, so take the risk seriously.
