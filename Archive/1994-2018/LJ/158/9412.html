It's easier than you might think to create your own OpenOffice.org
extensions.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2169580.0x2261240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you have a nifty macro or a nice Writer template you want to
share with other OpenOffice.org users, publishing them on the Web
along with detailed installation instructions is probably not the
best way to go. Fortunately, OpenOffice.org supports extensions&mdash;small
installable packages that provide added functionality. You easily
can turn your templates, autotext entries, gallery art and macros into 
extensions that can be installed with a couple of clicks. Better yet,
OpenOffice.org's extensions have an easy-to-understand and well-defined
architecture, and you can start building your own extensions in no time.
</p><p>
Extending OpenOffice.org's functionality using extensions is nothing
new. From the very beginning, users could add new features to the office
suite by installing so-called UNO packages. Usually, these packages
contained OOo Basic code, and they offered a more straightforward way of
integrating macros into OpenOffice.org applications. With the release of
OpenOffice.org 2.0.4, the idea of adding new features via installable
packages has been rethought thoroughly and aligned with a concept that
is more familiar to end users&mdash;namely the extension architecture of the
Mozilla Firefox browser. 
</p><p>
The technical implementation of the extension
system in OpenOffice.org also has been reworked. Most notably, the new
version of OpenOffice.org can handle so-called non-code extensions that
can contain document templates, gallery items, autotext snippets and so on. The
new version of OpenOffice.org also introduces the new .oxt file extension
that allows users to identify installable extension packages easily.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2169580.0x22614a8"></a>
How Extensions Work</h2></div></div><p>
An OpenOffice.org extension is essentially a zip file that includes
both the installable contents and additional metadata required to
install and register the extension properly. OpenOffice.org provides a
simple-to-use tool called Package Manager that lets users install
new extensions and manage existing ones. To install an extension,
simply choose Tools&rarr;Package Manager, select My Packages, and press
the Add button. Once the extension is installed, restart OpenOffice.org,
and you are good to go. Unlike Firefox, some types of extensions don't
require you to restart OpenOffice.org. For example, if you install
non-code extensions, you can use them right away.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9412f1.large.jpg"><img src="9412f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Contents of a Non-Code OpenOffice.org Extension
</p></div></div><p>
To better understand the anatomy of OpenOffice.org extensions,
let's dissect an empty sample extension from the OpenOffice.org Wiki
(<a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Non-code_extensions" target="_self">wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Non-code_extensions</a>). 
In order to peek inside the package, you have to change its extension
from oxt to zip. This allows you to treat the package as a regular
zip archive. The package consists of three elements: the META-INF
and template folders, as well as the Paths.xcu configuration file. The
META-INF folder contains the manifest.xml file that, among other things,
&ldquo;points&rdquo; to the Paths.xcu configuration file. The Paths.xcu file contains
information that the Package Manager uses to add the templates to the
appropriate location. This location is defined as %origin%/template, and
the Package Manager replaces the %origin% variable with the full path to
the internal template container. The fuse parameter adds the templates
to the specified container or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. To
create a new template extension, you don't need to tweak anything; the
configuration file and the overall structure of the extension remain
the same. All you have to do is copy your custom templates into the
template folder. Change the file extension of the resulting package back
to oxt, and install it via Tools&rarr;Package Manager. To check whether
the extension has been installed properly, choose File&rarr;Templates&rarr;Organize; you should see your templates in the My Templates folder.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2169580.0x2261870"></a>
Creating a Programmatic Extension from Scratch</h2></div></div><p>
Although creating non-code extensions is rather trivial, building packages
containing code (let's call them programmatic extensions) is a different
matter. The programmatic extension includes not only the code itself,
but also a more complex configuration file containing information
about menus, submenus, commands and macros assigned to them, icons and so
forth. Creating a configuration file manually, even for the most simple
programmatic extension, requires some technical knowledge, and it can be
rather time consuming. Fortunately, there is a tool that can automate
the entire process of creating an extension. Although the Add-on Tool
(<a href="http://documentation.openoffice.org/HOW_TO/various_topics/Addons1_1en.sxw" target="_self">documentation.openoffice.org/HOW_TO/various_topics/Addons1_1en.sxw</a>)
hasn't been updated since 2003, it still does a great job of generating
extensions that can be used with the latest version of OpenOffice.org. To
get to grips with the Add-on Tool and better understand the process
of creating a programmatic extension, let's build a simple dummy text-generator extension from scratch. Once installed, the extension adds the
Lorem ipsum command to the Tools&rarr;Add-Ons menu. This command runs an
OpenOffice.org Basic macro that inserts a specified number of paragraphs
with the Lorem ipsum dummy text. The following description assumes that
you have a general knowledge of how to create and manage macros, modules
and libraries in OpenOffice.org. The Add-on Tool uses the older term
&ldquo;add-on&rdquo;, which you can consider a synonym of
&ldquo;extension&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Start with creating a macro that generates the dummy text. To keep
things tidy, create a separate library called LoremipsumLib, containing
the LoremipsumModule. In this module, add the macro shown in Listing 1.
(Replace the &ldquo;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...&rdquo; string with a paragraph
of dummy text.)

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2169580.0x2261b88"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

Sub LoremipsumMacro()
Dim ThisDoc As Object
Dim Cursor As Object
Dim ParNumber As Integer

Do While ParNumber&gt;0
Cursor=ThisDoc.text.createTextCursor
Cursor.String="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..." &amp; Chr(13)&amp; Chr(13)
ParNumber=ParNumber-1
Loop
End Sub

</pre></div><p>
Before you fire up the Add-on Tool, you need to do some preparatory
work. First, create a separate folder for all your working
files (for example, loremipsum). If you want to add icons to the menu
items, make sure you have the necessary graphics files. According
to the official documentation, you need a set of small (16x16)
and big (26x26) icons in BMP format. However, you also can use
16x16 icons in PNG format (you can find some high-quality icons at
<a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk" target="_self">www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk</a>). Next, copy the
entire LoremipsumLib library into the loremipsum folder. To do this,
navigate to .OpenOffice.org2/user/basic inside your home directory, and
copy LoremipsumLib into the loremipsum folder. Finally, copy the icons
into the LoremipsumLib folder. Now, open the Add-on Tool document, and
make sure that macro execution is enabled. Scroll to the Create the
configuration file chapter, and press the Create XML file button to
launch the Addon Creator.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9412f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Using the Addon Creator to Create a Programmatic Extension
</p></div></div><p>
The process of creating an extension using the Addon Creator can be
roughly divided into three stages. First, you define the general setting,
including the top-level menu and its position. Then, you specify the menu
items, and finally, you zip the created package.
</p><p>
In the Basic Information window, specify the path to the
main script file. Press the Browse button, and select the script.xlb file
inside the LoremipsumLib folder. You also must specify a name for your
extension in the Unique name for your addon field. Simply replace the
example part in the org.openoffice.Office.addon.example string with
the name you want (for example, org.openoffice.Office.addon.Loremipsum). Press
Next to choose where to add the top-level extension menu. You have two
choices here: you either can add a menu item to the Main menu or under
the Tools menu. As a rule of thumb, if you have a simple extension
containing only a couple of commands, tuck it under the Tools menu. A
more complex extension deserves its own entry in the Main menu. Because
the Lorem ipsum generator contains only one command, it makes sense
to install it under the Tools menu. Next, enter a menu title, and press
the Add this text button. If you want to make your extension available
only for a particular language or country, you may do so by specifying
the appropriate settings in the Language restrictions section. Press
Finished when you are satisfied with the settings. 
</p><p>
The next step is
to link the LoremipsumMacro to the created menu item. To do this, you
have to specify the library, the module and the macro itself. In our
case, these are LoremipsumLib, LoremipsumModule and LoremipsumMacro,
respectively. Once you have linked the macro to the command, you can add
an icon to it. Because we've chosen to use an icon in PNG format, press
the Other image type button, select the 16x16 normal contrast item
from the Icon definition drop-down list, select the icon using the Browse
button, and press OK to add it. When adding icons, you have two options:
you either can link to an icon that will be added to the extension as
an image file, or you can integrate it into the configuration file (this
works only with icons in BMP format). Which option you choose is more or
less a matter of taste, but linking to icons rather than embedding them
produces a cleaner and easier-to-read configuration file. This can come
in handy if you need to edit the file manually later. Use the Finished
button to finalize the extension, and press the Addon zipping button to
pack it. Now you can install the created extension by choosing
Tools&rarr;Package Manager. Restart OpenOffice.org, and you should see the Lorem
ipsum command in the Tools&rarr;Add-Ons menu.

Tweaking Extensions</h2></div></div><p>
The Addon Creator conveniently hides the technical part of the
process, which is good if you don't want to spend time doing the donkey
work manually. This is, however, less useful if you want to gain a
better understanding of what makes extensions tick&mdash;not only to satisfy
your curiosity, but also to be able to troubleshoot your extensions and
tweak them without running the Addon Creator every single time.
</p><p>
If you look inside the zip package, you will notice that it contains
the familiar META-INF folder, a folder with the macro files and the
addon.xcu file (Listing 2). The latter is the key element of the extension, as it
contains all the configuration data. The addon.xcu is based on XML, and
even if you have only a basic knowledge of XML, you easily can figure
out how it works simply by looking at its contents.

          &lt;value/&gt;
        &lt;/prop&gt;
      &lt;/node&gt;
    &lt;/node&gt;
    &lt;node oor:name="Images"&gt;
      &lt;node oor:name="org.openoffice.Office.addon.Loremipsum.img01"
oor:op="replace"&gt;
        &lt;prop oor:name="URL" oor:type="xs:string"&gt;
 &lt;value&gt;macro:///LoremipsumLib.LoremipsumModule.LoremipsumMacro

        &lt;/prop&gt;
        &lt;node oor:name="UserDefinedImages"&gt;
          &lt;prop oor:name="ImageSmallURL"&gt;
            &lt;value&gt;%origin%/LoremipsumLib/Icon.png&lt;/value&gt;
          &lt;/prop&gt;
        &lt;/node&gt;
      &lt;/node&gt;
    &lt;/node&gt;
  &lt;/node&gt;
&lt;/oor:node&gt;

</pre></div><p>
The XML file contains a number of nodes, and each node has
properties, which, in turn, have values. For example, the top
node &lt;node oor:name="AddonMenu"&gt; has multiple properties,
such as &lt;prop oor:name="Title" oor:type="xs:string"&gt;, that
have a value containing the extension's menu title &lt;value&gt;Lorem
ipsum&lt;/value&gt;. The &lt;prop oor:name="URL" oor:type="xs:string"&gt; property has
the &lt;value&gt;macro:///LoremipsumLib.LoremipsumModule.LoremipsumMacro&lt;/value&gt;
value, which contains the link to the appropriate macro. Knowing that,
you can modify the extension by tweaking its addon.xcu file. For example,
if you want to change the menu title, you simply can edit the &lt;value&gt;Lorem
ipsum&lt;/value&gt; value as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;prop oor:name="Title" oor:type="xs:string"&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;Insert dummy text&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/prop&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
In more complex macros, you even can add new menus and commands 
simply by cloning and modifying parts of the configuration file.

Final Word</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you know the basics, you can start building your own
OpenOffice.org extensions. If you want to share your creations with
other users, you can add them to the official extension repository
(<a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Extensions_repository" target="_self">wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Extensions_repository</a>). Most
of the extensions there are released under the GPL, so you can dismantle
them to see how they work and get new ideas.
