Java is on its way to become mostly GPL but is it too late?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b0580.0x24a8348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Sorry to start with the spoiler, but the answer is, &ldquo;No, it is not
too late.&rdquo; I would certainly have preferred that Sun GPL Java before
Microsoft .NET was released. I think .NET would have been a total
non-starter in that case. But allow me to present the evidence that
Java is already kicking .NET keister on Linux.
</p><p>
Look at how pervasive Java has become even without the benefit of the
GPL. SourceForge is one of the most if not the most popular repository of
software projects for Linux (software is available for other operating
systems, including Windows, but SourceForge is primarily a Linux
repository). Java has enjoyed a highly prominent spot on SourceForge for
a long time, well before Sun announced that it would GPL most of Java. At
the time
of this writing, SourceForge lists 5,421 projects written in Java. The
number of Java projects outnumbers even C++ projects, at 4,582. Only 284
projects are listed for C# and only 34 projects for BASIC. I don't think
it will surprise anyone that C outnumbers all others with 8,558 projects.
</p><p>
Here is what .NET brings to the table that Java lacks. The .NET API
has richer functionality because it is not written to be a Write-Once-Run-Anywhere (WORA) platform. Java aims to be WORA, so it is missing some
pretty basic features, such as good support for USB or FireWire. That's
because direct support for hardware violates the WORA principle. You have
to write hardware and/or platform-specific Java extension libraries that
make use of the Java Native Interface to support these things.
</p><p>
Is that a bad thing? Must Java be faithful to WORA to be Java? In one
sense, the answer is yes. The core JVM should be faithful to WORA. But
that doesn't mean you can't extend Java to be platform-specific. Indeed,
I hope compiled Java, in addition to the WORA JVM, gets even better as
the community gets more involved in the future of Java. I am confident
that only good will come of the community efforts.
</p><p>
I expect hardware-specific extensions to projects will flourish once Sun
finishes its GPL-ization of Java. Java can remain a WORA platform
for those who want to use it that way, <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the community can
provide the tools you need to use Java as a magnificent platform-specific
language as well. So what if the add-ons violate WORA? It's a language,
not a religion. In contrast, the Mono team is dead set on providing the
non-WORA functions by playing catchup with the Windows API portion of
.NET. All I can do is tip my hat and say, &ldquo;good luck&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The current problem with Java on Linux that is now going away is that it
isn't usually a no-brainer to install Java on your favorite distribution.
That's changing quickly, but it's still hit and miss. Worse, some of
the best Java applications aren't available with a simple apt-get.
</p><p>
The <tt  >apt-cache search jedit</tt> command turns up
nothing, even on the future
release of Ubuntu, even though jEdit is a spectacular Java-based editor.
A search for the BitTorrent client Azureus brings up the GCJ-compiled
version. There's nothing wrong with that, but I'd still prefer to
run Azureus as a Java application. I have to download and install
Azureus manually if I want the non-GCJ version. There aren't all that
many professional-quality standalone client applications in Java, but
the ones I love and use are rarely available from standard application
repositories. I expect, or at least hope, that will change as the
GPL-ization of Java progresses and a Java virtual machine is installed
by default on all distributions of Linux.
</p><p>
But here's where Java stands to explode in usage. Currently, economy
Web hosting supports MySQL and PHP by default, with perhaps Perl and
maybe PostgreSQL. Java usually costs extra, most likely because it's
not free, and the commercial hosts who provide these services didn't
get Java installed by default. I'm betting that within one year, you'll
see all those $5 or more per-month hosting services provide Java and
JSP by default. I've even seen a few that already have taken this step.
Could I be wrong? It's certainly possible. I was wrong once before&mdash;October 1979, I think, but I could be wrong about that. Regardless, I
stand by my prediction that Java will explode on economy hosting services.
</p><p>
The bottom line is that if you haven't already taken the plunge,
do so. Java isn't as easy to pick up as, say, PHP. But, it's enough like
C/C++ that the learning curve won't be overly steep if you come from a
traditional C/C++ background. I've found that the key to learning Java
is to focus on how to use the error-handling features properly, which is
generally where I tripped up when I first tried my hand at programming
in Java.
