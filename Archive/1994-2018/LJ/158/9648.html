In Praise of Linux Games</h4><p>
I'm increasingly impressed by the variety and quality of games that are
available for Linux. Most of them are pretty wholesome, which I
appreciate,
as I don't care for on-screen violence any more than the real thing. Have
you considered adding a column devoted to Linux games? I'd bet lots of
people would read it. By the way, I've enjoyed Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s articles immensely
and have tried a lot of the programs he has mentioned. Reading
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> is a
great way to learn about interesting software. Keep up the good work!

Now You're Cooking with Linux</h4><p>
I would like to address the critics of Mr Gagn&eacute;. Marcel's column provides
people who are new to Linux topics that are not way over their heads
or beyond their needs. The different writing style/format makes the
column even more appealing to the Linux newbie.
</p><p>
By attracting new desktop users, Mr Gagn&eacute; makes a huge contribution to
the Linux community. Mr Gagn&eacute; does this both as a professional writer
and as a citizen. Evidence of this can be found in Mr Gagn&eacute;'s WFTL-LUG.
I would suggest that the complainers join the WFTL-LUG and find out
for themselves. Perhaps they can make a contribution or two in the LUG
instead of all this unproductive negativism.
</p><p>
By the way, the March 2007 edition was super. Keep up the good work.

Now You Don't See Them, Now You Do</h4><p>
In the April 2007 issue, Chris Trayner states in his letter &ldquo;Now You
See Them, Now You Don't&rdquo; that Konqueror no longer allows one to
right-click on a file and see an option to delete it. True, it is not there
by default. However, if you go to Settings&rarr;Configure
Konqueror&rarr;Behavior, you will see an option Show Delete context menu
entries, which bypasses the trash can. Check this box, and the delete option will be
present at right-click. Thank you for an outstanding publication!

Doc Searls, iPhone Home</h4><p>
In the April 2007 issue on page 42, &ldquo;Why an iPhone When We Can Make
Our
Own OpenPhone?&rdquo; by Doc Searls, the context that ANA is relating directly
with customers via the cell is misleading. I have worked with all three carriers
in Japan: NTT DoCoMo, AU and Yahoo Keitai (formerly Vodaphone Japan). Yes,
there is an IC system that allows passengers to check in quickly. Yes,
ANA will get stats on how many people are using the system, but JAL also
has this system and also the Japan railways (JR East/West). The technology
is based on Sony's contactless IC chip. But, the system is controlled by
each cell carrier. The carriers also control the Java applet that runs the
IC chip, so they too can receive stats on who is using the system. The
carriers here in Japan control which phones their service will use. It's
not as bad as in the US, as there are only three silos here. But, the
customers have no rights. With locked SIM chips, you can't get
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> unlocking code. Until
last year, there was no number portability. Just in the last five years,
Japan cell phones could be used overseas without the blessing of the
carrier. Interactive programs with the end user aren't possible. One
additional comment, the only reason IC-enabled cell phones exist is because
the train system started using IC-enabled train passes&mdash;JR being the
majority of railways and majority of the population rides those trains every day.

Cell-Phone Silos</h4><p>
Doc, you didn't mention the worst cell-phone silo of them all
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, April 2007, &ldquo;Why an iPhone When We Can
Make Our Own OpenPhone?&rdquo;]: the
crippling system that makes it impossible for cell phones to communicate
directly with each other. Whatever happens in software development for
mobile phones, this silo will stand as an insurmountable obstacle to
progress until the network model changes from the current client/server
system to an unrestricted, peer-to-peer, ad hoc model.
</p><p>
This transformation is certainly disruptive technology. As such, it will
probably follow the usual disruptive technology development path. It
will be ignored, ridiculed, lobbied against and actively resisted by
the existing technology providers, until it makes them irrelevant and
takes over the world.
</p><p>
What if this technology had been in use when Katrina hit New
Orleans? There would have been no communications problems into any area
where there was at least one phone within range of another, at any time,
including the height of the storm. Rescuers would not have had to wait
for days or weeks for destroyed infrastructure to be replaced just to
have basic communications.
</p><p>
Instead, there were thousands of working cell phones in the disaster
area, all rendered completely useless by the silo owners' communication
restrictions.
</p><p>
The future of wireless is already written large in the form of the
Internet. A self-organizing, self-healing worldwide network is an
unstoppable force. The next obvious step is to remove the wires, and in
keeping with the best Free Software traditions, this can be accomplished
from the bottom up, simply by doing it.

Banning Novell or Buying SCO?</h4><p>
A few issues ago [March 2007, /var/opinion], Nicholas Petreley called for
a ban on Novell after it signed an
agreement with Microsoft. Today, I read on Slashdot that Novell assents to
&ldquo;Windows Is Cheaper Than Linux&rdquo; (<a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39286295,00.htm" target="_self">news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39286295,00.htm</a>).
</p><p>
My advice to Novell: buy SCO. They both seem to be on the same path.

News about Dell's Article</h4><p>
As a frequent reader of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, I must tell you about good news from Dell. For sure, in consequence of 
the article &ldquo;A Modest GNU/Linux Proposal for Michael
Dell&rdquo;
(from <a href="http://www.informationweek.com" target="_self">www.informationweek.com</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Dell launched a Linux Web survey this week, moving it a bit closer
to reintroducing the open-source operating system as a factory-installed
option for home or office use.
</p><p>
The survey, which was posted Tuesday and runs through March 23, asks
a variety of questions, including which Dell system respondents would
like to see with Linux, what kind of computing chores they would use
the machine for, what type of software support they would like, and the
Linux distribution they favor.
</p><p>
In launching the survey, Matt Domsch, Linux software architect for Dell,
said in the company's official blog that Dell has been moved to action
by the more than 110,000 requests for Linux computers on the company's
on-line customer sounding-board IdeaStorm.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
So, for those of us who love to work outside the Windows world, this kind of movement
comes at a very important moment and shows to the &ldquo;monolitic,
one-way&rdquo; CEOs and &ldquo;Masters of the universe&rdquo; that intelligent life
exists here!
Keep up the great work there!

Blast from the Past</h4><p>
While cleaning out my desk, I found my Winter 1996 Linux Internet
Archive set.
Linux that ran on 4MB of RAM, MFM drives, EISA buses, Gravis
Ultrasound cards&mdash;it brings a tear to one's eye.
</p><p>
Anyway, thanks for the informative articles. I am a longtime reader
(someday I will get a subscription) and fan! Keep up the good work!.

Re: the &ldquo;Someone Else May Have to Decipher Your Code&rdquo; Letter in 
April 2007 Issue</h4><p>
In his letter titled &ldquo;Someone Else May Have to Decipher Your Code
Someday&rdquo;,
Michael C. Tiernan suggested the use of temp files instead of pipes for
readability, instead of thinking that pipes can be as easy to read as
code used in temporary files.
</p><p>
But, when using temporary files in a production environment, it should be
done right, so the lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Tmp1=/tmp/tmp.1.$$
Tmp2=/tmp/tmp.2.$$
Tmp3=/tmp/tmp.3.$$
Tmp4=/tmp/tmp.4.$$
</pre>
</p><p>
should be replaced by:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Tmp1=`mktemp`
Tmp2=`mktemp`
Tmp3=`mktemp`
Tmp4=`mktemp`
</pre>
</p><p>
or:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Tmp1=`mktemp /tmp/tmp.1.XXXXXXXXXX`
Tmp2=`mktemp /tmp/tmp.2.XXXXXXXXXX`
Tmp3=`mktemp /tmp/tmp.3.XXXXXXXXXX`
Tmp4=`mktemp /tmp/tmp.4.XXXXXXXXXX`
</pre>
</p><p>
for security reasons. First, mktemp ensures the filenames are unused,
and the files generated do have the access rights set to ensure that only
the owner can read the content.

Miniature OpenGL Development System</h4><p>
I just thought you might want to know about this project:
the myOS&mdash;Miniature OpenGL development system.
It is a minimalistic OpenGL-capable GNU/Linux-based system without
X. It is a bare-bones Linux system, stripped down of everything but the core
necessary files to compile and run OpenGL/C code. It has a simplified
directory structure and cleaned up internal cross-referencing. It starts
up with, and in total has, only a single script
(<a href="http://one.xthost.info/zelko/opengl.html" target="_self">one.xthost.info/zelko/opengl.html</a>).

Addendum to Collin Park's &ldquo;OpenOffice.org ODF, Python and
XML&rdquo; in the May 2007 Issue</h4><p>
After writing &ldquo;OpenOffice.org ODF, Python and XML&rdquo;, I
picked up a copy of the O'Reilly <span   class="emphasis"><em>Python Cookbook</em></span>,
2nd edition (Martelli et al), which is full of delightful recipes.
One of them, &ldquo;Extracting Text from OpenOffice.org Documents&rdquo;,
suggests a way to accomplish the task of the article in a more Python-ic
way, using Python's zip file library; the &ldquo;top layer&rdquo;
shell script would then not be needed.
