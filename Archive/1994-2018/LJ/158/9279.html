Cross-reference and convert source code to HTML for easy viewing.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x1227240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Every decent programmer has to study source code at some time or
other. Sometimes it's to learn new coding styles. Sometimes it's
to get an idea of how something works. Regardless of the reason, no
programmer can do without it. Studying the source code of small projects
is not difficult. You easily can do without formal methods. However,
when you want to study the source code of large projects, keeping track
of the various functions, variables and their definitions becomes a
huge problem. People are lucky if they can find the source code
on-line&mdash;doing so means they can use tools to process the source
code and help them study it. Such tools give people studying
source code advantages and flexibility never before dreamed of. One
such tool is the LXR (Linux Cross-Reference) tool.
</p><p>
Developed originally as a testbed application for a general hypertext
cross-referencing tool in Norway, its flagship achievement is
cross-referencing the Linux kernel source code. The code is
available at <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source" target="_self">lxr.linux.no/source</a> for browsing. Other projects
are at <a href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey" target="_self">lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey</a>, where the Mozilla source code
is available for browsing, and the FreeBSD source code is available at
<a href="http://fxr.watson.org" target="_self">fxr.watson.org</a>. LXR gives users the capability to jump to function
definitions, search for usages and so forth with only a single click. It
also supports indexing of e-mail and hypertext links.
</p><p>
The project is based on stock Web technology, so it can be accessed
via any Web browser. On the server side, it was developed using
Apache but should work with any Web browser supporting CGI-scripting
capabilities. The scripts that actually do all the work were developed
using Perl and rely heavily on Perl's powerful regular expression
libraries.
</p><p>
Probably the best feature of this software is that it is presented
to users in HTML format. Because of the HTML format,
it is easy to link various portions of the code to others. It is written
in Perl, so theoretically, it can run on any operating system that has
a Perl interpreter. What is really great about this tool is that it
supports multiple languages. This means it doesn't matter which
language your program is written in; you still can use this tool to
cross-reference and browse your code.
</p><p>
LXR is actually quite simple and clean. The users use
a utility called genxref to generate an index of the complete source
code. Once this is done, users access a Perl script called source
through a Web browser that reads the index files and generates the HTML
for the cross-referenced source code dynamically. Users then can browse
the source code as they want.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x12276b8"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installing and configuring LXR is pretty simple once you know a
bit about how it works and what the various configuration options
are. First, download the source tarball from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lxr" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/lxr</a>. At the time of this writing,
lxr-0.3 is the stable release. Once you have downloaded the tarball,
extract it using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash# tar -xvf lxr-0.3.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
After extracting the source, <tt  >cd</tt> to the newly
created directory, and open
the Makefile for editing with the text editor of your choice. You need to set
two variables here: INSTALLPREFIX and PERLBIN. PERLBIN
refers to the executable binary of the perl5 interpreter. In my case,
it was in /usr/bin/perl. INSTALLPREFIX is the directory where LXR will
be installed. It should be in a location that is accessible via a Web
browser. On my system, that's Apache 1.3.33, and I chose to install
it under /var/www/htdcos/. Thus, my Makefile looked something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# Makefile for installation and configuration of LXR

# The location of your perl5 binary

PERLBIN=/usr/bin/perl

# LXR will be installed here

INSTALLPREFIX=/var/www/htdocs/lxr

# End of configuration parameters

CGISCRIPTS=find ident search diff source

PERLMODULES=SimpleParse.pm Common.pm Config.pm

....

....

....
</pre>
</p><p>
Leave the rest of the Makefile unchanged. At the console, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash# make install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x1227a28"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and LXR is installed in the specified directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x1227b30"></a>
Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Now, <tt  >cd</tt> to the directory where LXR was installed
(in my case that was
/var/www/htdocs/lxr). Three subdirectories should be there: bin,
http and source. Although the source code you want to cross-reference
can be placed anywhere, I prefer to put it under the $INSTALLPREFIX/source
subdirectory. I put the glibc-2.3.5 and OpenMOSIX-2.4.26 source
code here. Now, we have to generate the index files that LXR will use
to generate the cross-referenced source code. So,
<tt  >cd</tt> to the directory
with the source code, and execute the genxref script in
$INSTALLPREFIX/bin:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash# /var/www/htdocs/lxr/bin/genxref .
</pre>
</p><p>
The . at the end tells the script that the source code is contained
within the current directory. Next, sit back and enjoy the ride until
the parsing is complete. Once it's done, you should have two new files
in the current directory&mdash;the directory containing your source
code&mdash;fileidx and xref. These two files are the ones lxr needs
to generate the cross-referenced source code when you browse it. Make
sure that others have read permission for these files. To do so, type the
following while still in the source directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash# ls -l fileidx xref
</pre>
</p><p>
The output should be something like:


<pre     class="programlisting">
-r--r--r-- 1 nobody root 671744 2006-08-24 05:06 fileidx*

-r--r--r-- 1 nobody root 8425472 2006-08-24 05:06 xref*
</pre>
</p><p>
The third r should be set. If it isn't, you can set it by doing the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash# chmod o+x fileidx xref
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, it's time to configure LXR for use. Change directory to
$INSTALLPREFIX/http/ (in my case, that is /var/www/htdocs/lxr/http/),
and open the lxr.conf file for editing. The lxr.conf file is the most
important file you need. It has several different configuration options.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x1228000"></a>
Variables</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing you'll see when you open the file is a definition for
a variable called v. As with programming languages, you can define
your own variables and use them later in the configuration file. Wherever
they occur, they will be replaced by whatever value they have. Variable
values are referenced by the configuration file by $/variable-name. Variable
definitions follow one of two possible formats:

<pre     class="programlisting">
variable: /variable-identifier, variable-name, 
/(/list-of-values/), /default-value/
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x1228160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:

<pre     class="programlisting">
variable: /variable-identifier, variable-name,
/[/file-containing-list-of-values/], /default-value/
</pre>
</p><p>
Here's what the terms stand for:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
variable-identifier: the name the variable will be known as
throughout the configuration file.
</p></li><li><p>
variable-name: the actual name of the variable that will be
displayed to the user.
</p></li><li><p>
list-of-values: comma-separated list of values to be displayed.
</p></li><li><p>
file-containing: a file that contains a list of possible
values.
</p></li><li><p>
list-of-values: the list has each entry on a separate line. The
user can select any one of them. The absolute path of the file should
be provided.
</p></li><li><p>
default-value: the value that the variable will take on by default. The
first value is automatically set if this is not specified.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x1228790"></a>
baseurl</h2></div></div><p>
The baseurl is the URL relative to which all of the scripts required by LXR
are placed. It should be accessible via a browser. In my configuration,
it's http://my-ip/lxr/http/ &lt;http://localhost/lxr/http/&gt;. Make sure to
place the / at the end, or the last directory will be ignored.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x1228898"></a>
HTML Headers and Footers</h2></div></div><p>
When the HTML for the source is generated, LXR can add headers and
footers to the pages. Sample headers and footers are provided in the
$INSTALLPREFIX/http/ directory. They're called template-head and
template-tail. In addition, you also can change the way files and
directories are displayed by LXR by modifying the template-dir file. The
locations of these files can be specified by the htmlhead, htmltail
and htmldir options in the lxr.conf file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x12289a0"></a>
sourceroot</h2></div></div><p>
This option tells LXR where to look for the actual source code. In
my case, it's /var/www/htdocs/lxr/source/glibc-2.3.5. If you want
to cross-reference multiple projects, all you have to do is create
a variable specifying the location of each of the directories
that contain the source code. Then, you can specify the value
of the variable as the sourceroot. For example, I set up the sources for
glibc-2.3.5 and OpenMOSIX-2.4.26, placing the sources for both of them
in /var/www/htdocs/lxr/source in their individual directories with the
same names as above. In lxr.conf, I had a line like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
variable: s, Source, (glibc-2.3.5, OpenMOSIX-2.4.26)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x1228b00"></a></h2></div></div><p>
then:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sourceroot: /var/www/htdocs/lxr/source/$s
</pre>
</p><p>
Thus, the appropriate source code is automatically selected based on
the value of the source variable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x1228cb8"></a>
srcrootname</h2></div></div><p>
srcrootname specifies the name of the project whose source code is
displayed&mdash;for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
srcrootname: $s
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x121f6a8"></a>
incprefix</h2></div></div><p>
This specifies the locations of the header files that are to be included
in the project.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x121f7b0"></a>
dbdir</h2></div></div><p>
This is the location of the fileidx and xref files generated by
genxref. If you have multiple projects, specify a separate location for
each, as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dbdir: /var/www/htdocs/lxr/source/$s/
</pre>
</p><p>
These are the only options you need to set when configuring
LXR. Additionally, you can specify the location of the glimpse binary
using glimpsebin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x121f968"></a>
glimpsebin</h2></div></div><p>
glimpse allows users to search for specific files within
the source code and to search for any text within source
files. You can obtain the latest version of glimpse from
<a href="http://webglimpse.net/trial/glimpse-latest.tar.gz" target="_self">webglimpse.net/trial/glimpse-latest.tar.gz</a>. Extract and install
it. Once you are done installing glimpse, go to the directory where the
source code is installed, such as /var/www/htdocs/lxr/source/glibc-2.3.5,
and do the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash# glimpseindex -H . .
</pre>
</p><p>
The output should look something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
This is glimpseindex version 4.18.2, 2006.

Indexing "/var/www/htdocs/lxr/source/glibc-2.3.5" ...

Size of files being indexed = 81711416 B, Total #of files = 10075

Index-directory: "/var/www/htdocs/lxr/source/glibc-2.3.5"

Glimpse-files created here:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 676398 2006-09-08 05:51 .glimpse_filenames

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 40300 2006-09-08 05:51 .glimpse_filenames_index

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 2006-09-08 05:50 .glimpse_filetimes

-rw------- 1 root root 1783314 2006-09-08 05:51 .glimpse_index

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 686 2006-09-08 05:51 .glimpse_messages

-rw------- 1 root root 836 2006-09-08 05:51 .glimpse_partitions

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 23888 2006-09-08 05:51 .glimpse_statistics
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates the required glimpse index files in the current
directory. Once they're created, make sure read permission is set for
others:


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash# chmod o+r .glimpse-*
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, set the glimpsebin option in lxr.conf to wherever you installed
glimpse. I installed it in /usr/local/bin/glimpse.
</p><p>
That's it; save and close the lxr.conf file. The only thing remaining
to do now is configure the Web server to work with LXR.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x121fd88"></a>
Configuring Apache</h2></div></div><p>
The Web server I used was Apache 1.3.33. The first order of business is
to set the permissions for the LXR directory. You can do that by editing
the httpd.conf file, normally found under /etc/apache/httpd.conf. Add
the following lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;Directory /var/www/htdocs/lxr&gt;

AllowOverride All

Options All

&lt;/Directory&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Simply replace the location with wherever you've installed LXR. Then,
go to $INSTALLPREFIX/http/ and create and open a file named .htaccess for
editing. Type the following lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;File ~ (search|find|source|diff|ident)?&gt;

SetHandler cgi-script

&lt;/Files&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
This tells the Web server to treat the above-mentioned files as CGI
scripts. If you don't do this, the server will display only the contents
of these files. Close and save .htaccess. We are now ready to browse
the cross-referenced source code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x121fff0"></a>
How to Use LXR</h2></div></div><p>
After all of the above steps are done, all you have to do is open
a Web browser and go to the URL, http:///my-ip//lxr/http/source, where /my-ip/ is the IP of your Web
server. When you open the Web page, you will get something like what is
shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9279f1.large.jpg"><img src="9279f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Source Code Navigation via the Browser
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, users can select any of the source code files for
browsing. At the top, I'm using the template provided by LXR. It includes
links to navigate the source code, search for a particular identifier,
search for any text within the source code and search for any file.
</p><p>A few utilities of note:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Source navigation: select this option to browse the source code of
your choice.
</p></li><li><p>
Identifier search: search for the definition and uses of a particular
identifier. Requires the ident script.
</p></li><li><p>
Freetext search: search for any text within the source files. Requires
the search script.
</p></li><li><p>
File search: search for files matching the passed string. Requires the
find script.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
All of these utilities also can search using regular expressions to
match the strings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x112f580.0x12206d0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
LXR is an excellent tool. It makes life a lot easier for people who
want to study source code, and it's powerful and easy to use. The fact
that it uses dynamically generated Web pages to browse the source code
gives users a lot of flexibility in configuring it. Also, because it
can be accessed via any Web browser, it imposes no limitations on the
platform, client or location of users. This interoperability is one
of the reasons LXR is so powerful.
