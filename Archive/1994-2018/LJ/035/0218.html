    Garden Grove, California is run by Linux&mdash;read how it
    happened here.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b5580.0x24ad6b8"></a>Background</h2></div></div><p>The City of Garden Grove has been a Pick shop since
implementing a Microdata Reality in the late 1970s. The original
system supported 24 users. In 1984 the Reality was replaced by a
Honeywell/Ultimate machine with over 100 serial ports for terminals
and printers. In 1990, the City needed a larger system, so it
replaced the Ultimate with a 512 user Data General running DGUX
/Advanced Pick. At the same time, the City was beginning to use
personal computers (PCs) in the workplace, leading to the need for
a PC network. A consultant was hired in 1993, but his equipment
recommendation was declined due to budget constraints.</p><p><a href="0218f1.jpg" target="_self">Layout of the
Computer System</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b5580.0x24ad870"></a>Evolution</h2></div></div><p>Still needing a network, the Information Systems department
needed to develop a phase-in plan, so under the direction of the IS
manager, Robert Shingledecker, in June 1993 a mini-lab was set up
to evaluate different network solutions for a multi-server
environment in. The first network chosen for testing was Novell
4.0, which promised seamless integration of multiple servers. Two
Novell network engineers took three weeks to set up the first
server and then an additional three weeks to set up a second one.
Even then, the integration was not as promised.</p><p>Disillusioned with Novell, Bob decided to go out and purchase
the newly released Windows NT. The IS staff took only 3 days to get
NT up and running. Unfortunately, at that time NT's speed was
unimpressive, Netbeui (the only available protocol) was not
routeable, and NT was unable to share printers with the existing
Unix system.</p><p><a href="0218f2.jpg" target="_self">Staff Group
Picture</a></p><p>Since the City was already using Unix, Unix was the next
system considered for networking. After researching Unix networking
on the Internet, the decision was made to try out a NFS network.
Unfortunately, four different commercial NFS clients failed to work
with Microsoft's newly released Word 6.0. The first NFS product to
solve the Word problem was XFS, a shareware NFS client from
Germany, available on the Internet. The Internet soon became an
invaluable source of both information and software. The City
installed its first production network in July 1994, in the Public
Services Department, using an SCO Unix 486 File Server and 16
XFS/Windows 3.1 clients. The PCs had dual connections&mdash;Ethernet
connections to the local SCO server and serial/mux connections to
DGUX/Pick.</p><p>In September 1994, IS learned that the City would be moving
to a new building, and that our network project would have to be
accelerated. The computer systems for each campus building,
especially that of the Police Department, would have to be able to
&ldquo;stand alone and be fully functional.&rdquo; XFS did not run on Windows
3.11 at that time, so we continued to search the Internet for a
network solution. That's when we discovered Samba. Samba emulates
SMB networks (LanManager, WFW, Windows NT) on Unix, and provides an
even easier solution for networking since
<span   class="bold"><b>no</b></span> additional non-Microsoft
software had to be loaded on the clients. The next production
network was installed in December of 1994 in the Housing
Department, using an SCO Pentium File server and 20 Windows for
Work groups (WFW) clients. The Samba network proved faster than any
network previously tested, and in addition, it was much easier to
maintain. The server was also running a 16 user license of Advanced
Pick (AP), so now the clients had only one connection to the
server&mdash;Ethernet. Immediately following this success, we set up
another Samba network for the Police Department that included a 48
user license of AP running on an SCO Pentium file server with 100
WFW clients.</p><p><a href="0218f3.jpg" target="_self">Front of the
New City Hall</a></p><p>In February 1995, having taken care of all the satellite
buildings, we prepared to move City Hall, connect all local
buildings via Fiber and plan a Wide Area Network (WAN) including a
T1 connection to the Public Services Department. Meanwhile, the
discovery of Samba led to the discovery of the Unix Platform it was
developed on, Linux. Linux had everything SCO had&mdash;plus much, much
more including Internet tools. Testing then began on the use of
Linux. Linux is amazingly simple compared to SCO, its setup and
performance is better than SCO and it's free. In April 1995, the
Public Services Network was converted from SCO/XFS to Linux/Samba
with noticeable performance improvements. In June 1995, discussion
began on what to do with the Data General (DG), as the City planned
to move into its new building in November.</p><p>Pick systems released a Beta copy of AP/Linux and the City
started testing it in September 1995. After discussions with Pick
Systems regarding support of AP/Linux, it was decided to leave the
DG behind and run the City with the successful
Intel/Linux/Samba/Pick network. The City also established a
presence on the Internet in September by setting up a web page
(http://www.ci.garden-grove.ca.us) hosted by Deltanet Internet
Services, with future plans to bring it in house.</p><p>In November, the DG was abandoned, and the new City Hall is
now run by two Linux Pentium File servers. One runs Samba and
serves the PC network, and the other runs the Advanced Pick
database. Together the servers handle 150 WFW clients. Housing's
SCO/AP/Samba server was changed over to Linux followed by the
conversion of the Police server from SCO to Linux in March.
Concurrently, the Fiber backbone was installed throughout the
Campus buildings. IS was now prepared to set up an intranet. By
this time the network consisted of 8 servers (5 production Linux
servers, 2 lab [test] Linux servers and 1 Sun server for imaging).
The City Hall Samba Server was now running NCSA's web Server and
the City's intranet was born.</p><p>The IS staff then began to work with HTML, Perl and Python to
create CGI applications on the Web. Next, we decided to get the
Pick Server involved. The first web page to extract data from the
Pick Server did so with HTML, CGI and Perl. It was done by having
the Perl script call a Pick application which wrote to a temporary
file in Unix that was then read by the calling Perl script. This
method worked, but proved to be slow. Because of the networking
features of Linux and AP, we decided that the speed could be
improved if the two servers communicated over sockets. The new
speed was incredible. Almost instantaneously, the data requested by
the web page was returned by the Pick server. The City's intranet
was undergoing a growth spurt, and a GUI solution for Pick
applications had been found.</p><p>In June of 1996, the City added a T1 speed Frame Relay
connection to Intelenet Internet Services, adding yet another Linux
Server that acts as a firewall between the new Frame Relay line and
the City's network. IS is currently in the process of bringing the
City's WWW page in house. We can now write applications to make
information on the Pick Server available to the world via the World
Wide Web. IS is also creating an imaging system based on the WAIS
server&mdash;so development continues.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b5580.0x24addf0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Without Linux and Samba, the project could never have come in
within budget nor made the time-line for the move. In just a few
short months, the City switched from a mini-computer with dumb
terminals to a total network environment. The Linux machines run 24
hours a day and have proven to be very stable and reliable. Our
thanks go out to all the Internet community for providing such a
wonderful environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b5580.0x24adef8"></a>Equipment</h2></div></div><p>The city now has over 300 486 and Pentium PC92s running WFW,
Microsoft Office and Netscape Navigator. All are connected with
10baseT Ethernet cards (NE2000 and 3COM). Microsoft Telnet is used
to connect to the Pick Server for legacy applications.</p><p>Linux servers are Intel-based Pentiums (100-133) with 64MB
RAM, (2) 1GB SCSI drives and a 2GB DAT tape drive.</p><p>Printers are all HP LaserJets connected with an internal Jet
Direct Card (Ethernet).</p><p>The network includes Category 5 cable with a Fiber Optic
backbone, T1 line to Public Services, and 1544 Kbps Frame Relay to
the Internet, 3COM hubs, patch panels and switch, Prelude and ADC
DSU/CSU92s, and a Cisco Router.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23b5580.0x24ae108"></a>IS Staff</h2></div></div><p>The Informations Services staff consists of a manager, 2
systems analysts and a technician. Robert Shingledecker is the
Information Systems Manager for the city of Garden Grove,
California. He has written early machine code and assembly language
programs. He uses the Internet regularly to research solutions for
the city's IS needs and future developments. He can be reached at
roberts@exo.com. The authors are the systems analysts. Victor
Chang, Information Systems Technician, supports the PC client's
needs&mdash;he installs and supports software (Windows, MS Office,
Netscape, etc.), troubleshoots and fixes hardware problems.</p></div></div>
