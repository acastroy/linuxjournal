    In this Part 1 of 2, see how to have a single machine answer
    connections to multiple IP addresses and respond differently for each.
    This
    installment covers WWW services.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x223e580.0x2336348"></a></h2></div></div><p>As Internet sites grow in number, some
clients want to create a presence without dedicating a machine to
the task. In many cases, a client may never get the amount of usage
which would justify a dedicated machine. People like florists and
civic event organizers may not have any other use for the machine,
so the extra hardware would go to waste.
</p><p>The solution to this problem is to use a single computer to
serve multiple clients. If the machine is serving web presences,
FTP directories, and e-mail services almost exclusively, a single
machine with enough horsepower can easily handle the needs of
several clients, especially those with low traffic.</p><p>However, this solution has a drawback, with which many are
familiar. Although several domains can be easily pointed to a
single host, the URLs will produce the same results regardless of
which service, and which domain, was requested. For example, if
tryme.com and comehere.com both pointed to the same host,
http://www.tryme.com/ and http://www.comehere.com/ would produce
exactly the same main page&mdash;clearly not what these organizations
would have in mind.</p><p>But this problem has a solution&mdash;virtual services. A virtual
service is exactly like a standard service (Web, e-mail, or FTP),
but it provides different results depending on which target was
selected, despite the fact that they all reside on the same
machine.</p><p>This month, we examine how to set up and use a virtual web
service. Next month we cover e-mail and FTP, as well as possible
future capabilities. Keep in mind the Perl motto: &ldquo;There Is More
Than One Way To Do It.&rdquo; As the Internet has grown, several
alternatives have sprung up. This document describes only one
method, and by the time you read it, there may be others, so look
around before you decide on any one path!</p><p>Please note, in all the solutions described, I assume that
you have at least two domain names registered and operating, and
two IP addresses. You should have working routes to both IP
addresses, and nslookup from any outside Internet host should
return the correct IP address for each domain name. You can consult
other references for information on how to do this.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x223e580.0x2336608"></a>IP Aliasing</h2></div></div><p>IP aliasing is the key to the virtual services on the level
of the operating system. As the intended audience of this article
is Linux users and system administrators, I will present only the
information pertinent to Linux. Other operating systems may or may
not have the capability to do IP aliasing, and you should consult
your documentation and other publications for information on
them.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, only one IP address may be tied
to each network device. The virtual services described in this
article rely on having a separate IP address for each domain
serviced. How, then, does one manage all the traffic with a single
machine? IP aliasing makes this possible.</p><p>To enable IP aliasing you must first compile your kernel with
IP aliasing support. If you don't already have the kernel sources,
you shouldn't continue without them. Obtain a fairly recent kernel
distribution from a suitable mirror site and unpack the archive,
typically into /usr/src/linux. Then go into the directory and
re-make the kernel. Be sure to answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the question about
whether or not to support IP aliasing.</p><p>If you think your kernel might already support IP aliasing, a
quick way to check is to verify the existence of /proc/net/alias*
files. Once you have the support enabled, you simply need to
configure the interfaces in a slightly different manner. Normally
this would be done with a combination of
<b  >ifconfig</b> and <b  >route</b>. The
following is a common example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 10.1.1.10 &lt;other options&gt;
/sbin/route add -net 10.1.1.0 gw 10.1.1.10 &lt;other options&gt;
</pre><p>This creates a setup for the <b  >eth0</b> device
(which you should replace with whatever device you use for your
connectivity) and adds a route for the local network
(<b  >10.1.1.*</b>) to go through it. (This will also
automatically handle the route to the device itself.)
</p><p>To handle IP aliasing, we simply add a colon and the alias
number to which we want to refer. If we had obtained IP addresses
10.1.1.6 and 10.54.21.8 from our service provider, and we wanted
them both to talk to our ethernet card connected to our T1 router,
we would use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/ifconfig eth0:0 10.1.1.6 &lt;other options&gt;
/sbin/ifconfig eth0:1 10.41.21.8 &lt;other options&gt;
/sbin/route add -net 10.0.0.0 dev eth0:0
/sbin/route add -host 10.41.21.8 dev eth0:1
</pre><p>This will set up two aliases for the Ethernet card, 0 and 1,
each with a different IP address. All traffic to either IP address
will be seen by any daemon listening to the Ethernet device, and
traffic anywhere in the 10.* realm will be routed out through the
first device, as a safety catch. You may need to modify these lines
to support additional options and, perhaps, a default route. That
is all there is to it!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x223e580.0x2336b30"></a>Virtual Web Servers</h2></div></div><p>The point of virtual web services is to present different
document trees to users requesting pages from the same machine
using different domain names. Users receive the main index page and
path names associated with a particular domain name, without any
knowledge of the other domains which exist on the same
machine.</p><p>There are actually two solutions to this problem. The
newcomer to the scene uses a fairly elegant method where the
client, in its request, also specifies the exact target it was
looking for. However, this works only for web services, and only
with quite recently released clients from Microsoft and Netscape.
If you want to support everybody without relying on the client to
make your services work, you will need another solution.</p><p>The problem is fairly simple once you understand it. You need
a modified HTTP daemon listening to requests coming in to a
specific IP address, rather than all those directed to the current
machine. Then a server is started for each virtual client, with
options specifying different configuration files, document source
trees, and so on.</p><p>Most web servers now support the requirements for virtual
services, but some do not. You will need at least version 1.5 if
you use the NCSA server. I use the Apache server, version 1.1.1.
Other servers designed as &ldquo;drop-in&rdquo; replacements for the NCSA
daemon should have this capability, but you should check your
server documentation for details on configuring this
feature.</p><p>To date, almost every server has a different configuration.
This article covers the Apache daemon only because it is what the
author uses, not because the author considers the server to be more
or less capable than any other.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x223e580.0x2336d98"></a>Setup</h2></div></div><p>Once you have <b  >ping</b> working on the two
domain names, you can begin to configure your virtual web services.
The most important thing is to select an intelligent document tree
layout. If you only have a few clients, you might have a single
source root with different subdirectories, one per client. Their
tree would then be rooted at their respective subdirectory. If you
have more clients, you may need a more complex layout. It is
important to decide this <span   class="bold"><b>now</b></span>
because changing it later can become quite messy.</p><p>In your server configuration file, you need to set up
services for each domain. This is easily done in Apache by
enclosing configuration statements within a
<b  >&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</b> container. For example, the
following configuration for 10.1.1.6 (the IP address we obtained
for www.tryme.com) would be changed from:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ServerName www.tryme.com
ServerAdmin webmaster@tryme.com
DocumentRoot /usr/web/tryme/docs
TransferLog /usr/web/tryme/access.log
ErrorLog /usr/web/tryme/errors.log
</pre><p>to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;VirtualHost 10.1.1.6&gt;
ServerName www.tryme.com
ServerAdmin webmaster@tryme.com
DocumentRoot /usr/web/tryme/docs
TransferLog /usr/web/tryme/access.log
ErrorLog /usr/web/tryme/errors.log
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>


This will instruct Apache (and several other similar daemons) to
accept requests with those configuration parameters
<span   class="bold"><b>only</b></span> for those requests directed
to 10.1.1.6, in this case www.tryme.com.
</p><p>Note that this automatically disables server-hosting, and any
other targets must be set up as well, or they will not be
accessible. Normally, if a machine had several IP addresses,
requests directed at any address would be serviced. Including a
&lt;VirtualHost&gt; specification prevents this activity. Also note
that virtual hosting in Apache can include an optional port number
(e.g., &lt;VirtualHost 10.1.1.6:8080&gt;) to provide services for a
specific port.</p><p>Once you have this configured, start or restart the web
daemon, and you should be configured for virtual web services! Next
month we examine virtual e-mail and FTP services, and new
techniques that provide similar functionality.</p></div></div>
