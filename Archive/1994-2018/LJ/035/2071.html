<b  >statd</b> a Problem</h2></div></div><p>First let me say that I enjoy <i  >LJ</i> very
much and get a lot out of every issue.</p><p>I'm considering using Linux in some commercial installations
and have held off because of a glaring omission in the networking
subsystem. I can find no evidence of Linux support for the NFS
lockd and statd network lock managers which are required to
guarantee exclusive file access over NFS. Our application support
software uses a shared NFS mounted file system and must have this
to work. I believe the lack of this capability will impede Linux's
acceptance in enterprise computing environments that depend on
robust networking support. Other than that, it seems Linux offers
the most bang for the buck for Unix computing and networking. Toby

Freedom&rdquo;, Phil Hughes) in the October 1996 <i  >Linux Journal</i>, #30, and thanks for webbing Richard M.
Stallman's letter for background. Will you entertain a comment from
an outsider?</p><p>It's too bad the word &ldquo;political&rdquo; has such a bad flavor.
Virtually everyone wants to make things better in his community
(the <span   class="emphasis"><em>polis</em></span>) and tries to persuade others to
cooperate in doing so, i.e., acts politically... the catch, of
course, being how to decide what is &ldquo;better&rdquo;.</p><p>I don't use Linux. I make a living writing commercial
software for commercial platforms. I have also written, published,
and placed in the public domain a few utility programs. I did so
for at least three reasons I'm consciously aware of (not
necessarily in priority order):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>to make useful tools available to others</p></li><li><p>to share my pleasure in solving a problem
elegantly</p></li><li><p>to show off what a clever bugger I am</p></li></ul></div><p>At least one of these motivations&mdash;the desire to benefit my
fellows&mdash;RMS also feels. Perhaps he feels the others as well.
Nothing wrong with any of 'em.</p><p>You suggest RMS &ldquo;feels that everyone has to believe exactly
the same things he does.&rdquo; I read his letter somewhat
differently.</p><p>First, let's dispose of the myth of &ldquo;free&rdquo; software. They
ain't no sech animal. Even if you obtain it without exchange of
valuta, you must still invest time and skullsweat to use it&mdash;both
scarce and valuable commodities, perhaps more so than money. So,
any system competes with all others for your investment, whether
cash changes hands or not.</p><p>Perception is reality. If Linux and GNU do not share a name,
they are more likely to be perceived as distinct rather than
variants of the same thing (one of RMS's points, and I agree). If
they are distinct, they compete.</p><p>And &ldquo;free&rdquo; software already competes with the notion &ldquo;if
it really was valuable, you'd be charging us for it&rdquo;&mdash;as Heinlein
pointed out, why do you think they take collection in church? Added
competition between Linux and GNU can't help but drain both against
the &ldquo;common enemy&rdquo;, which I think is what he is saying.</p><p>I'm sorry to have to disagree with Linus Torvalds, but it
<span   class="bold"><b>does</b></span> matter what people call
Linux, and this is why. Since Adam's day, to name a thing is to
have power over it... and to be trapped by its paradigm.</p><p>(Insert clever pun about &ldquo;Paradigms Lost&rdquo; here. Oh, never
mind.) That's my two pfennigs, anyway. Hope you enjoyed it.Davidson
CorryDAVIDSCO@Attachmate.com</p><p>Phil Hughes points out RMS asked for and was offered the
opportunity to respond, but so far, we've not heard from
him.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2037580.0x212ff50"></a>OpenGL Does Perl</h2></div></div><p>The November 1996 issue (#31) contains a very nice article on
the OpenGL libraries by J&ouml;rg-R&uuml;diger Hill [&ldquo;Linux Goes
3D: An Introduction To Mesa/OpenGL&rdquo;].</p><p>In that article it is stated, &ldquo;Mesa can be called from C and
Fortran routines&rdquo;, which is true, but I felt obligated to let your
readers know OpenGL and MesaGL are also callable from Perl 5. Stan
Melax has an OpenGL module which is described at
http://www.arc.ab.ca/vr/opengl/.</p><p>I have just installed it and the requisite MesaGL library and
headers on a Solaris box, and I must say it is plenty impressive
(the clip script is only 116 lines long&mdash;if you don't count shebang
and comments, it is only 70 lines of Perl!). The
<b  >examples/</b> directory of the OpenGL module for
Perl also includes a <b  >tk_demo</b> script that uses
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mainloop()</em></span> event handler of the Tk
extension to Perl (whereas the other demos do their animation with
built-in Perl loops). I know Perl's Tk400.200 extension compiles on
most major Linux distributions, and I am fairly certain the OpenGL
module does as well.</p><p>Thanks for a great issue on graphics.  Peter
Prymmer pvhp@lns62.lns.cornell.edu</p><p>A timely note for our focus on Perl this issue.
Thanks!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2037580.0x21302c0"></a><i  >LJ</i> to the Rescue</h2></div></div><p>Last week I was int eh field, working on a piece of equipment
controlled witha computer runnin iRMx, a &ldquo;unix-like&rdquo; Intel product
from about 1980. I needed logfiles from the machine. Using all of
my clues, I was unable to write on the 3.5" diskette without first
using RMX to format it. I turned the equipment back over to the
customer and went away witha n unreadable diskette containing data
the factory needed right away. Certainly you cannot read it on a
Windoze box!</p><p>Next I tried it with my lInux system (Debian 2.0.24). While
Gates's garbage reads only one kind of file system, maybe RMX is
readable as one of the many file systems Linux will support...Load
up the modules and hack away: Sorry, no luck!</p><p>Then I remembered my <i  >LJ</i> issue 32, which
I picked up on the way to the airport. Out it came and straight I
went to Sam Chessman's excellent article, &ldquo;What is dd?&rdquo; I ran Sam's
&ldquo;Example 1a&rdquo; to make a disk image. Voila! I have a file? Mov e the
image file to the FAT partition, kill Linux and run Windoze to
e-mail it home, along with instructinos for the Unix guys at home
to run Sam's &ldquo;Example qb&rdquo; to recreate the diskette.</p><p>They tried it but did not succeed (you know, th edd supplies
with SunOS may not be as capable as ours). So I resolved to hack on
the image file. As it turned out, using <b  >CTRL</b>-K a
few timmes in Emacs turned it into radable plain text log files!
&mdash;D.W. Wieboldt dwiebold@Aus.etn.com</p><p>Thanks for letting us know you found the article useful (and
thanks to Same Chessman for writing it in the first place). We love
to hear about Linux being useful (even as frequently as it
is).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2037580.0x2130630"></a>Oracle Client Under Linux?</h2></div></div><p>Regarding &ldquo;Stop the Presses&rdquo; in <i  >Linux Journal</i> #32, December, 1996, two items:The first
concerns SCO UNIX &ldquo;Give-away&rdquo;. I bit, paid, the 20-some bucks and
got the CD. It was primarily for work; I wanted to do a
demonstration of what Unix could do. The IBMers are quite leery of
Linux&mdash;software with no huge corporation after thier money. They
just don't know how to relate.</p><p>Anyhow, I got a PC loaner from network services and was going
to load SCO up and I couldn't get to first base! Turns out, SCO
doesn't seem to believe IDE hard-drives are used. The installation
couldn't see I had 1.6 gigs of space&mdash;just said I didn't have a
hard drive and so it couldn't proceed. Yeah, I'd be worried about
that company if I wanted to see Linux thrive (giggle...).</p><p>Afterwards, I brought in Red Hat 4.0. It installed without a
hitch. The only thing holding Linux back at my work site is the
poor token-ring support. I just haven't been brave enough to even
consider trying to develop new drivers.</p><p>The second item is a question: Have you heard of anyone
running a UNIX Oracle client under LInux? Or getting access to
Oracle data through ODBC or other means? Just curious.</p><p>I do appreciate your magazine. It's fun and provides a lot of
useful information. Keep up the good work.  &mdash;Dean
Siewertdsiewert@execpc.com</p><p>Being fair, we plan to subject Free SCO OpenServer to a
review in an upcoming issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It's real &ldquo;UNIX&rdquo; so
it'll be lots better than Linux, right?</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>As I've done earlier in this month's letters. I
refer your question regarding Oracle clients on Linux to
the</em></span> <i  >LJ</i> readers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2037580.0x2130aa8"></a>More Thoughts on Free SCO</h2></div></div><p>I have taken what I consider to be a very critical look at
the SCO offering and I would like to convey the following
observations:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>SCO's product is a compliment to the existing Unix
community. It provides casual and concerted users another
opportunity to gain insight and respect for an already proven great
operating system.</p></li><li><p>SCO's product will
<span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> infringe, impinge or detract
on pico-iota from the existing community of Linux users.</p></li></ol></div><p>In this MS-day and MS-age, it is imperative alternative
operating sytems be encourages to grow and flourish. One of the
most effective means of giving a boost to alternative operating
systems&mdash;and Unix specifically&mdash;is to make them truly accessible to
the common user. To this end, SCO is making a significant
contribution.</p><p>And almost as quickly the contribution ends. SCO's offering
is sexy, slick and almost inaccessible. It provides all of the Unix
tools and almost none of the more necessary understanding. Having
started life as a DOS user, I view SCO's contribution as cold and
disenfranchizing as Apples' Systme 7 or Windows 95. It has all of
the functionality while offering no real understanding of the
contents of the operating system's &ldquo;black box&rdquo;.</p><p>Linux, my first exposure to Unix, provided the all-important
tool for true inderstanding : accessibility. I am able to lift the
hood, kick the tires and generally test drive the OS functionality
in a hands-on fashion. In my naive and simplistic view, this is the
best enfironment for learning. Let SCO offer but know that Linux
provides!
