System that comes with Linux. I am sitting in a barren room, with a
keyboard and monitor in front of me. I have the manuals for the
graphics card and the monitor. I also have a stack of blank paper
and a small calculator. I sit in the room and look up numbers in my
manuals, spend five minutes calculating and entering a modeline
entry, and then restart X. The shadow from the weak winter sun
moves across the wall behind me as I work. It is dark in the room
when finally I can bring up a display in 1024x768, and I quietly
rejoice... only to have the monitor transmogrify from a nice Mag
into a Packard Bell.</p><p>I've been having this dream for about three years now, and
I'm convinced it is the result of an attempt to configure an old
version of XFree86 that took about 12 hours one winter day.
XFree86, in its infancy, was a menacing nightmare to configure. In
recent years, it has gotten easier: probes have been written and
configuration scripts have been included to assist users. This has
not alleviated the pain as much as I hoped. The appearance of
Metro-X and Accelerated-X in the offices of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, begging for a review, has turned my worst
nightmare into an exercise in rebellion: now I can reconfigure X
for the hell of it, in about twenty seconds. Excellent.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ec580.0x16e5318"></a>Accelerated-X</h2></div></div><p>The first server I installed was Accelerated-X (AccelX) from
X Inside. It comes as a tar archive, split across two floppy disks.
The documentation comes in the form of an odd-sized manual and
reminders to check the X Inside web site for the most current
documentation. This is important, as the documentation that came
with the software was a little dated. Accelerated-X requires you to
have XFree86 installed already; the system requirements are fairly
minimal:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux 1.2.13 or later</p></li><li><p>4MB of RAM</p></li><li><p>At least 3MB free disk space under /usr</p></li><li><p>A supported graphics board (see
http://www.xinside.com/bd/ for a current list).</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="1374f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a></p><p>To install AccelX, you simply untar the floppies (as
root):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/X11R6/lib ; tar -xzvf /dev/fd0
</pre><p>The configuration for AccelX is a very simple console-mode
menu system in which, using arrow keys, you select the options that
match your hardware (see Figure 1). All options are fairly well
documented in the manual. Once I configured the server, I brought
it up as a regular user and started up some applications. The one
problem I had was with the mouse&mdash;a cheap Microsoft Mouse
knock-off. I thought that was the trouble, anyway. It turns out
that Linux kernel version 2.0.0 introduced a problem with the Async
mouse feature of Accelerated X. Async mouse is the feature that
allows the mouse to move around the screen even when the X server
is busy doing something else&mdash;a very useful trick Microsoft has
been using for a while on their Windows product. X Inside notified
the Linux kernel team and worked with them to correct the problem,
so that with the release of the 2.0.26 kernel, the situation was
resolved, and the mouse no longer wipes applications right off the
desktop, killing the connection between the client and the
server.</p><p>X Inside offers several optional enhancements, including
multi-headed display, Motif, and OpenGL.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ec580.0x16e5948"></a>Metro-X</h2></div></div><p>Metro-X is a little more full-featured than Accelerated X. It
comes out of the box with multi-headed display capabilities and
touch-screen support for products from three different
manufacturers. It also requires that XFree86 be installed. This
comes at the price of 12MB of hard drive space, however. Metro-Link
also offers Motif and OpenGL at additional cost. System
requirements include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux (no version was specified)</p></li><li><p>8MB of RAM</p></li><li><p>12MB of hard drive space</p></li></ul></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="1374f2.large.jpg"><img src="1374f2.jpg"></a></div>
 Figure 2. Metro-X Configuration Utility</p><p>Metro-X comes as a cpio archive spread across three floppy
disks, or it can be downloaded via FTP from the Metro Link archive.
Installing the software involved moving the tar file from the
floppies via cpio, and then running a small installation script
which installs the files and begins the configuration.</p><p>Metro-X brings up the X server in a low resolution to allow a
GUI interface, even on an unconfigured machine (see Figure 2).
Clicking on the different icons exposes options for different
pieces of hardware. Several mouse clicks, and I had things
configured. There is also a curses-based setup utility that is very
similar to Accelerated X's setup utility in case the X server isn't
available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ec580.0x16dc758"></a>So Which Server is Better?</h2></div></div><p>Before we get to The Chart, I did notice one interesting
thing while I was playing around with the two servers. If
/usr/X11R6/bin/X is a soft link to an XFree86 server, such as
XF86_SVGA, AccelX will move the XFree86 server to X.LINUX. If,
however, /usr/X11R6/bin/X is linked to, oh, say, Xmetro (the
Metro-X server), then AccelX will turn Xmetro into a link to
Xaccel, destroying the Xmetro server. Hmmmm.</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x15ec580.0x16dc860"></a><p class="title"><b></b></p><table     summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p><span   class="bold"><b>Variable</b></span></p></td><td><p><span   class="bold"><b>Metro-X</b></span></p></td><td><p><span   class="bold"><b>Accelerated X</b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Graphics card Support</p></td><td><p>38 manufacturers</p></td><td><p>51 manufacturers</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>multi-head</p></td><td><p>up to 4 displays</p></td><td><p>Additional Cost add-on</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hot-Keys</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Configuration</p></td><td><p>GUI and curses</p></td><td><p>curses only</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>System Requirements</p></td><td><p>8MB RAM 12 MB HD space</p></td><td><p>4MB RAM, 3 MB min HD space</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Require XFree installed</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>touch-screen</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Documentation</p></td><td><p>printed, web</p></td><td><p>printed, web</p></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><p>Price</p></td><td><p>$99</p></td><td><p>$99.95</p></td><td class="auto-generated">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>I am currently running Metro-X. I have two friends who swear
by X Inside. Which server is better sort of depends on your needs.
Metro-X has more support for commercial applications, including
multi-head display and touch-screen capabilities. Accelerated X
supports more graphics cards, making it more likely to suit your
hardware.</p><p>Bottom line? Check your hardware against both lists, and if
both servers will meet your needs, flip a coin&mdash;they're both
cheaper than a day spent calculating modelines.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15ec580.0x16de3e0"></a>Accelerated X Update</h2></div></div><p>The mouse trouble noted in our review of Accelerated X&mdash;the
