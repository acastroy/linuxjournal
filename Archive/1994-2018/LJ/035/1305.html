    NEdit is something new in a Linux programmer's editor.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d3e450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Here is something new. Not vi, not emacs,
not just a wrapper for some hackneyed old Motif widget. With a
sparse but sufficient keyboard command set and full regular
expression substitutions, NEdit has the best mouse integration I've
seen yet in a Linux editor, free or otherwise.
</p><p>Weighing in at a little over a megabyte for the static-linked
Motif binary, NEdit starts up slower than the last editor I wrote
about, xvile, but much faster than emacs or xemacs. Scrolling is
fast, and command execution shows no perceptible delay.</p><p>It's easy to learn, economical on keystrokes due to its
excellent mouse support, and not too difficult to customize using X
resources; featuring multiple undo/redo, NEdit earns very high
marks from me.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d3e608"></a>Mouse Support</h2></div></div><p>NEdit handles both rectangular and linear regions selected by
the mouse. With rectangular regions, you can:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Select</p></li><li><p>Resize</p></li><li><p>Drag the region or a copy of it</p></li><li><p>Lay region over destination text</p></li><li><p>Shift text in the destination out of the way</p></li><li><p>Extend or shrink region in any direction</p></li></ul></div><p>No command or function keys are used for any of these&mdash;just
mouse clicks, drags, and CTRL, ALT, and SHIFT chording. Many other
operations are available via command keys, mostly CTRL- or ALT-
modified, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Cut or paste to cut buffer</p></li><li><p>Left-justify region</p></li><li><p>Replace region with typed text</p></li><li><p>Delete</p></li><li><p>Regular expression substitution</p></li><li><p>Run region through command line filter</p></li></ul></div><p>Unlike some other editors, rectangular regions are not bound
on the right by the shortest line in the region. Likewise, when you
move a rectangular region, you can move it as far to the right as
you like.</p><p>Most things you can do with rectangular regions also work
with linear regions, which start some place in a line and
incorporate all intervening text until some place in another line.
In fact, you can convert between linear and rectangular regions
while working with them, just by pressing or releasing the CTRL
button.</p><p>Linear selection is supported by an xterm, so you may paste
text such as command line dialogues, listings of files, and so on,
from an xterm directly into a NEdit window. This saves me a great
deal of time when filing bug reports and writing release
notes.</p><p>Motif secondary selection is present also, in both linear and
rectangular flavors. This provides some very nice features.</p><p>Dragging mouse Button 2 or Button 3 (depending on your flavor
of Motif) underlines text; when you release, the underlined text is
moved or copied to the location of the I-beam cursor. The position
of the SHIFT key chooses move or copy.</p><p>If there is a primary selection at this time, the secondary
selection replaces it or, if you hold ALT when you release the
selection mouse button, it is exchanged with the primary selection.
The varieties of secondary selection are great for moving sentences
around in a paragraph, re-ordering the clauses of a C language
<span   class="emphasis"><em>switch</em></span> statement, or inserting text from one
editor window to another.</p><p>These mouse-based capabilities alone save me perhaps 80% of
the keystrokes I'd use in vi for similar text manipulation
tasks.</p><p>As is customary under Motif, if you select some text, then
begin typing, the typed entry replaces the selected text. This
provides the handiest way to delete blocks of selected text, using
the backspace key.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d3f370"></a>Design Philosophy</h2></div></div><p>Mark Edel writes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The world of GUIs under Unix is a clash of
cultures. Unix is all about flexibility and programmability. Modern
GUIs are all about uniformity and standards. Finding middle ground
is not easy. I'm proud that NEdit can satisfy users who want to
change everything (&ldquo;I want my backspace key to invoke this awk
script, and I want all of my buttons blue&rdquo;) as well as those who
want to use it right out of the box and learn at their own
pace.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Menus and Dialogs don't automatically make good
GUIs. Quality really means working hard to make the program clear,
efficient, consistent, modeless, and error-proof. A good GUI under
X, for example, must devote a lot of code to basic stability,
because critical infrastructure components are not fixed: window
management, keyboard focus policy, colors, fonts, key bindings, to
name a few.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d3f5d8"></a>Problems</h2></div></div><p>NEdit is a work in progress and appears to have some memory
allocation problems. I've had several segmentation violations while
running it, and the file selection box sometimes loses its state
entirely during a long run with many files open, requiring exit and
restart before it becomes useful again. These problems have not
been severe or frequent enough to prevent me from making daily use
of NEdit for some months now, in preference to several other more
stable but less usable editors.</p><p>It is possible the problems I've observed originate with the
Motif to which my copy was linked.</p><p>Release 4.0.2 may be out by the time this article reaches
press, with some bug fixes and perhaps one or two new features. [It
is. Dan says that 4.0.2 is mostly a bugfix release, though syntax
colorization is being actively worked on, and an alpha version of
colorizing NEdit is available from ftp.fnal.gov&mdash;Ed.]</p><p>The default key bindings under Linux required some tinkering
to get them to where I wanted them, with the Backspace key deleting
to the left of the cursor, the Delete key deleting right, and the
Insert key toggling between insert and overstrike modes. This and
other customizations were accomplished using only the information
available from the help button, however, without resorting at all
to the man page.</p><p>The user who is accustomed to syntax highlighting won't find
it here, though Mark Edel informs me dynamic syntax highlighting is
a frequently requested feature. There is a working prototype of
this, with continuous incremental re-parsing, on the fly. The
syntax highlighting, and also a more complete macro capability, are
targeted for release early in 1997.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d3f840"></a>Volunteers</h2></div></div><p>About 95% of the ongoing work on this editor is performed by
Mark Edel. He's willing to incorporate volunteers, who have greatly
aided the project with many bug fixes and help with porting NEdit
to most flavors of Unix. However, he writes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Volunteers are certainly appreciated, with a
couple of minor caveats. It is very important to keep the NEdit
interface simple, and code that goes gonzo on obscure features
faces certain rejection.</p></blockquote></div><p>He also indicates that the cross-platform nature of this
editor makes robust code difficult for many volunteers to write,
often requiring rewrite by the core developers before it can be
incorporated into the main distribution.
</p><p>At this point, volunteers are being actively sought to
provide emacs bindings for menus and translations, and several
ancillary tools, such as ctags and call tree browsers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d3faa8"></a>Amenities</h2></div></div><p>Keypad support is good, with the Insert, Delete, Home, End,
Page Up, Page Down and arrow keys all doing reasonable
things.</p><p>Ever struggle with some editor's notion of how a C comment
block should look? Seems like nobody gets it quite right, and
nobody handles all the oddball cases. Now, with NEdit, I can take a
typical function header as in the illustration, and with just a few
mouse clicks and keystrokes convert this into a much neater
form.</p><p>In the first figure, I've selected a region to justify. The
width of the selection gives the resulting width, with portions of
lines to the right folded in. As you can see, there are tear-off
menus, and almost everything you need to learn or remember about
this editor is shown there.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="1305f1.large.jpg"><img src="1305f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Selecting a Region in a C Comment Block
</p></div></div><p>The second figure shows the text after justification. One
justified block has been dragged, and a linear selection is shown,
as I am about to hit the Backspace key to delete it.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="1305f2.large.jpg"><img src="1305f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. After Justifying the Region
</p></div></div><p>Ctags are supported. Vertical and horizontal Motif scrollbars
are present. Windows may be split, and multiple windows may be
opened into different files. Regular expression support includes
full egrep regular expressions, though find and replace are the
only actions available on regular expression matches. Undo-redo
extends to the beginning of session, even through file
saves.</p><p>Vi users will appreciate that the ESC key mostly does
nothing. After a while you get over punching ESC constantly, and at
that point you might remap the key to something useful.</p><p>Some nice touches for programmers allow you to select the
line number in an error listing from a compiler shown in an X
window, then go to NEdit and locate that like number with just a
CTRL-E. &ldquo;Search&rdquo; likewise allows searching for text selected in
some other window. &ldquo;Tag&rdquo; search likewise will pick up a selection
from another window. So will ''file open'', in which you select
text containing a file name, then open that file using
CTRL-Y.</p><p>Fairly detailed customizations including key rebinding, and
some scripting may be accomplished using X resources. Minimal macro
support is available with the current version (4.0.1). Shell
escapes may be used to run scripts on the edit text.</p><p>Of near-production quality editors I've used, NEdit is the
easiest to learn. This is partly because the keyboard command set
is sparse, and partly because the menu bar at the top gives the
keyboard accelerators for most of the common actions. After you've
looked an action up several times in the pull-down menus, you may
remember the keyboard accelerator and not need the menus. On-line
help is well indexed; terse, but complete. For the most part,
neither novice nor expert need refer often to the very excellent
and detailed man page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c46580.0x1d36a70"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p>NEdit is available under GPL as source or static linked Motif
binary from: ftp://ftp.fnal.gov/KITS/pub/NEdit/v4_0_1/. Building
from source requires Motif libraries, not at present available as
freeware. NEdit is on the LessTiff test suite, and so it should be
one of the first large applications to run under this free Motif
workalike.</p><p>Two discussion groups are NEdit_discuss and NEdit_announce,
