Source-Navigator and Code Fusion. These tools focused on providing
a better-integrated, Linux-based development and debugging
environment. Cygnus recently added another tool to the Cygnus
development tool chest, named Cygwin. With Cygwin, Cygnus takes a
step in a slightly different direction. Cygwin is a port of GNU
development tools to Windows NT. This port also brings a Linux/UNIX
environment to the Windows platform.
</p><p>You might ask, why would I want it? What does this do for me?
The answer is, &ldquo;it depends.&rdquo; Are you a developer who wants to
bring your Linux/UNIX open-source projects to Windows platforms? Do
you want to develop open-source Windows applications? Or are you a
Linux/UNIX administrator with the responsibility of also
administering Windows NT workstations and servers? Cygwin can
support all three situations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119d580.0x1295b88"></a>Shells and Power Tools</h2></div></div><p>Once Cygwin is installed, an administrator has the same shell
interface on both Windows and Linux/UNIX platforms. Many
traditional Linux/UNIX shell commands are included with the
product. In the two default directories /bin and /contrib/bin, I
counted about 300 commands and basic Linux/UNIX tools. (In this
context, I am calling a command such as
<span   class="bold"><b>wc</b></span> a tool.)</p><p>In addition to NT's GUI administrator interface are several
console NT administrative commands. These include a series of
&ldquo;net...&rdquo; commands that may be used to stop, start, pause and
resume services. For example, these commands can be used with
printers, print queues and shared items. There are also commands to
change certain user account attributes. The command
<span   class="bold"><b>net send</b></span> is used to send a message
globally or to a specific user. A set of TCP/IP-related commands is
also available.</p><p>The ability to intermix the Windows console commands, like
those above, and Linux/UNIX commands in the same program is the
result of Cygwin's integration with Windows. Jointly, these
commands, tools, Linux/UNIX programs and shell scripts may be used
to manage a Windows platform. I did have to play a little with
escapes and quotations to get the Windows commands to execute
properly from within bash scripts.</p><p>Several open-source Internet d&lt;\#230&gt;mons are included
in the Cygwin product. <span   class="bold"><b>telnetd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ftpd</b></span> are examples of the included
<span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> d&lt;\#230&gt;mons.
Capabilities such as <span   class="bold"><b>rlogin</b></span> are
also provided. Combined, these tools make it possible to do system
administration of Windows platforms remotely. Some inetd
d&lt;\#230&gt;mons duplicate Windows commands. I kept getting a
syntax error on a couple of commands, until I used &ldquo;which&rdquo; to
learn the command's real location. A slight change in Windows
pathing corrected my syntax problem.</p><p>Most administrators have a favorite scripting language and
set of power tools. Cygwin scripting languages include bash, ksh
and tcsh. Power tools such as Perl, Tcl/Tk, awk and sed are
included. I also found both the vim and xemacs editors. I got a
strange behavior with xemacs, though. The xemacs file-open menu
option caused a dialog box to appear momentarily. All other xemacs
menu options seemed to behave normally, as did the traditional Ctrl
keyboard commands.</p><p>Cygwin does not automatically build a POSIX-compliant
directory structure. Therefore, the library you need may be in a
different location. I had to make pathing edits to a couple of the
supplied awk scripts. Constructing a POSIX directory structure and
properly linking to directories should reduce pathing edits.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119d580.0x1296058"></a>Familiar GNU Tools</h2></div></div><p></p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3813f1.large.jpg"><img src="3813f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Source Window</p></div></div>
</p><p>Cygwin contains eleven GNUPro tools optimized for Intel
Pentium processors. These tools include GNUPro compilers, linkers,
assembler and comparison tools. The Cygnus Insight Visual debugging
tool is also included in the package. Insight was formerly known as
GDBTk. Figure 1 is a screen capture of the Insight debugger's
Source Window. The October 1999 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> contains a review of GDBTk.</p><p>Cygwin may be used to develop both console and GUI-based
applications. The cygwin.dll portability library makes it possible
to write and compile Windows applications with GNU tools. This
library also supports the ability to port Linux/UNIX open-source
projects to Windows. A sizable subset of UNIX SVR4, BSD and POSIX
APIs have been integrated into Cygwin. These APIs make it possible
to develop traditional Linux/UNIX programs on a Windows platform.
Combined, these features and tools provide a standard Linux/UNIX
GNU development environment on a Windows platform.</p><p>Using Cygwin to compile a console-mode C application on a
300MHz Pentium II with 64MB of RAM produced a timely response. A
couple of Perl and awk scripts also performed well.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3813f2.large.jpg"><img src="3813f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Sample Window</p></div></div>
</p><p>Simwin.c contains code for a simple no-frills window.
Compiling from the command line performed well. Issuing the
simwin.exe command at the bash shell prompt caused the sample
window to appear on the desktop as though it belonged there (see
Figure 2). Resource files and DLLs are required to compile more
robust Windows applications. Cygwin includes the capability to use
custom resource and DLL files. The documentation briefly highlights
building and linking to DLL and resource files. I am not a Windows
developer, therefore, I was not able to exercise some of Cygwin's
Windows compiling features seriously.</p><p>The documentation says Cygwin uses standard Windows APIs.
According to the documentation, use of standard Windows APIs means
Cygwin will keep functioning whenever Windows is upgraded to the
next release.</p><p>As with the other Cygnus tools, Cygwin is under the GPL. Be
sure to review the various licensing terms and conditions before
distributing your applications. All programs or applications
developed with these tools must be open source. This does not mean
you can never use the tools to develop commercial applications,
however. Contact Cygnus for information regarding licensing if you
want to do commercial work.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119d580.0x12967e8"></a>Installation and Setup</h2></div></div><p>Cygwin requires at least a Pentium processor with 32MB of RAM
and 100MB free disk space. The supported operating system is NT 4.0
with at least Service Pack 3. Plan to allot more than 100MB for
this product. Install Shield suggested 300MB would be required for
the basic product and contributed files. When source code was also
selected, the storage requirement went up into the 1GB+ range. On
my system, I selected the basic product and contributed files. They
appear to use about 140MB of disk space.</p><p>Cygnus uses the very reliable Install Shield to install
Cygwin. Install Shield properly installed and registered Cygwin
with my Windows system. Pay heed to installation instructions.
Cygwin should not be installed in any directory with spaces in the
directory or path names. Once installed, traditional Linux/UNIX
escaping, quoting or tabbing is necessary to get to directories
with spaces in their names.</p><p>After installation, several steps are required to set up the
Cygwin environment. A few of the tasks that need to be done include
creating mount points for existing disk drives and directories;
establishing the desired POSIX Cygwin directory structure;
establishing environment variables; establishing and verifying file
and path naming conventions; and customizing the shell.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119d580.0x12969a0"></a>Security</h2></div></div><p>Platform security is an area requiring a few moments of
attention. Maintaining platform and file system security is
important, and maintaining security on platforms containing
business data is critical.</p><p>Cygwin has two security-related options: NT Extended
Attributes (ntea) and NT Security (ntsec). Ntea can work with both
FAT and NTFS file systems. The NTFS file system is required by the
ntsec option. Enabling the ntea option permits NT file permissions
to behave like UNIX file permissions. This option works best with
NTFS file systems. It does work with FAT file systems. After using
ntea a while with the FAT file system, one can expect a major
performance hit.</p><p>NT can reproduce the POSIX security model. Enabling the ntsec
option will cause file ownership and permissions, and process
privileges to be treated in a UNIX-like manner. For processes, this
means one can start a process with the group owner being the
administrator. Anyone who is a member of the administrator group
may send signals to the process. Normally, only the ID creating the
process has permission to send signals to the process. Proper
function of ntsec requires both /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.
Using supplied tools, these files may be generated from the NT
security files.</p><p>I am not sure how adding Cygwin to an NT platform impacts
maintenance of a desired security posture. Once fully integrated,
altering an established NT security posture with Cygwin seems
possible. I do have one general question: are two sets of security
reviews and corrective actions now required, one for NT and one for
Linux/UNIX (Cygwin)? I believe the Cygnus documentation should
include some discussion or clarification related to which NT/Cygwin
security attributes take precedence.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119d580.0x1296bb0"></a>Documentation and Support</h2></div></div><p>A couple of sections in the manual provide concise
information and guidance on Cygwin functions. Much of the rest is a
collection of facts about the product. These facts have been
organized to appear as though they are providing guidance. One
example is the &ldquo;Setting up Cygwin&rdquo; topic. This topic presents
eight bullet items, pointing to various pages. Each set of pages
discusses aspects of setting up Cygwin, so one must go to eight
different places in the manual to read about the Cygwin
environment. This technique is used several times throughout the
manual. I found the process of piecing information together
tiresome. I never got the feeling I had seen all the information I
needed to configure Cygwin properly.</p><p>On-line documentation includes man pages, Texinfo and HTML
pages. Some man pages are no longer actively maintained. Instead,
one should use the Texinfo source. Texinfo is the authoritative
information source for many traditional man pages. Cygwin has
complete control over the HTML files distributed with the product.
Cygnus suggested the HTML files are the more accurate source of
information at the time the product is shipped. Therefore, the HTML
documentation should be consulted first.</p><p>The web-based FAQ is not very big, however, the few minutes
it takes to browse this FAQ are worth the time. It provides an
itemized list of implemented ANSI C and POSIX.1 API calls. All of
the compatible APIs are also listed in the local on-line and
printed documentation.</p><p>The Cygnus documentation is considerate of individuals who
have Windows experience. References to Linux/UNIX and Linux/UNIX
programming for the non-Linux/UNIX-initiated are provided.</p><p>Product installation support is available. Once the
installation support ends, assistance may be obtained from the
Cygwin mailing list, cygwin@sourceware.cygnus.com. Another source
of information is the sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin web site.</p><p><a href="3813s1.html" target="_self">The Good and the Bad</a></p></div></div>
