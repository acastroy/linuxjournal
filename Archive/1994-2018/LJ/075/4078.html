<span   class="bold"><b>ipchains</b></span> as a firewall and to
proxy my other machine to the Web via DSL. This Linux firewall has
two NIC cards: one with a public IP address, the other on my
private 10.100.100 network. I have a web server on the private
network (10.100.100.20). How do I configure ipchains to redirect
all web requests at my firewall to the web server on my internal
network?  &mdash;Mitchel Vernor, mitboy@hotmail.com</p><p>You'll need to use a port forwarding tool (such as
<span   class="bold"><b>redir</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>ipmasqadm</b></span>) to &ldquo;redirect&rdquo; all
requests that try to connect to port 80 (assuming you are using the
default port) of your firewall's address to the web server's
address. <span   class="bold"><b>redir</b></span> is a user-space
program that has some limitations, but works with older kernel
versions. <span   class="bold"><b>ipmasqadm</b></span> (which I
recommend) works with 2.2.x (some 2.1.x also)
and it is kernel-based.</p><p>Assuming all other input, output and forward chains are
present, you should simply add:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipmasqadm portfw -f
ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L EXTERNAL_FIREWALL_IP 80
-R 10.100.100.20 80
</pre><p>to your startup script.  &mdash;Mario de Mello Bittencourt
Neto, mneto@argo.com.br
</p><p>More information on port forwarding under kernel versions 2.2
and higher, including examples, can be found at
<a href="http://www.monmouth.demon.co.uk/ipsubs/portfw-2.2.html" target="_self">www.monmouth.demon.co.uk/ipsubs/portfw-2.2.html</a>.  &mdash;Chad
Robinson, Chad.Robinson@brt.com</p><p>If you don't have ipmasqadm on your system, you can find it
here:
<a href="http://juanjox.kernelnotes.org" target="_self">http://juanjox.kernelnotes.org/</a>.
You need at least kernel 2.2.x for this to work (although there are
patches for 2.0.x), and your kernel must have <b  >IP: ipportfw
masq support&nbsp;(EXPERIMENTAL)</b>, which is an option you
can select only if you checked &ldquo;Prompt for development and/or
incomplete code/drivers&rdquo; during configuration.  &mdash;Marc Merlin,
marc_bts@valinux.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1433580.0x152b6b8"></a>PPP Networking</h2></div></div><p>Can I have a PPP connection that supports TCP/IP using a null
modem between Win98 and Linux boxes? Any one of the machines needs
to dial up to the other. I am using Red Hat 5.2.  &mdash;Kiran,
ajay@cc.usu.edu</p><p>Yes, you can. I would set up the Win98 machine to
&ldquo;call&rdquo; the Linux system by double-clicking on a dial-up
connection. I prefer this way, since the Windows machine expects to
&ldquo;log in&rdquo; to the remote system and the Linux box can provide that
&ldquo;login&rdquo;. For this to work, you have to take care of the proper
setup (pin out) of the serial cable that connects the machines
together. Also, depending on the cable setup, it would be a good
idea to tell the Windows machine, at the dialup port configuration
setup, not to wait for the dial tone before dialing. The
Linux box will not provide a dial tone. On the Linux side, you can
create a new login ID with a password and configure it to have the
PPP daemon as the login shell, instead of the usual bash. Also, you
have to set up the serial port on the Linux box to provide the
login automatically all the time. A good page that explains this in
great detail is

into another partition of his hard disk. The installation process
of Red Hat has deleted the partition table of his hard drive. We
need a way to recover some important files which are in the Debian
partition. We can't access the partition. Can you explain some way
to do it?  &mdash;Alexis Serafin, sith@arrakis.es</p><p>If you know exactly what the partition
table looked like before the crash, you can simply write a new
partition table that looks exactly like the old one, mount the old
partitions and back up the data. If the install process was aborted
immediately after the new partition table was written, this alone
may solve the problem. If all else fails, try this: make a
partition that includes the whole disk (say, /dev/hdb1), mount that
and raw-copy the entire disk to a big file (on another disk) with
something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
dd if=/dev/hdb1 of=/bigdisk/recovered.data bs=512
</pre><p>Then, try to piece the files together using
/bigdisk/recovered.data. Personally, I've tried only the dd step,
so there may be problems with this approach beyond the fact that
stitching up the files manually is awfully difficult. Consider it a
desperation strategy. I know it's never helpful to hear this after
the disaster occurs, and please don't think I'm not sympathetic,
but the best way to deal with problems like these is always
prevention: keep backups, and print out critical information such
as partition tables before you need it. This is the voice of bitter
experience speaking.  &mdash;Scott Maxwell,
maxwell@ScottMaxwell.org
</p><p>While it is hard, you can look for the boot partition
signature (55 AA at the end of the block, I believe) and locate the
partitions on your disk. The above requires a disk editor, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>diskedit</b></span> from Norton, and once you
have the partition offsets, you can go to the partition table
(first block of your disk, apply the partition table view and key
in the numbers). Note that it's not trivial, and having another
computer as a model to look at and copy from helps quite a bit. You
can also try <span   class="bold"><b>fixdisktable</b></span> which
automates this (only for primary partitions, though); it can be
found at

computer. What about removing Windows 98 safely? I had Windows 98
on the first partition of my hard disk (/dev/hda1) and Red Hat 6.0
on logical partitions (/dev/hda5, 6, ...). I was able to dual-boot
using LILO, which was installed on the master boot record. One day,
I decided to part with Windows 98 forever. I ran
<span   class="bold"><b>mke2fs</b></span> on /dev/hda1 and divided it
into three partitions. Now when I boot my computer, LILO does not
appear at all, and I need to boot using a floppy.</p><p>I tried to install LILO (by running /sbin/lilo), but in vain.
I tried removing LILO and re-installing it, but when I ran
<b  >/sbin/lilo -u</b>, I got the following error
message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
The boot sector of /dev/hda does not have a LILO signature.
</pre><p>I booted the machine using a Windows 98 boot disk, ran
<b  >fdisk&nbsp;/mbr</b> and reinstalled LILO. Nothing
doing.
</p><p>I got a CD of TurboLinux from the March issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, installed it on the new
partitions I created and had LILO installed in the master boot
record. It didn't work. What should I do to boot using LILO
again?  &mdash;Tam Laying, tamlayin@oupchina.com.hk</p><p>Make sure your lilo.conf file looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
boot=/dev/hda
compact  # faster, but won't work on all systems.
ramdisk = 0
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=100
image=/boot/vmlinuz
        label=linux
        root=/dev/hda5
        read-only
</pre><p>Then run
<span   class="bold"><b>lilo</b></span>, and it should
install a fresh boot block. Your problem may have been linked to
partitions being shifted or renamed when you created the new
ones.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com

and there is no sound. I have set up my Soundblaster Live! which
works okay. I also have a Voodoo2 3dfx card&mdash;do I have to set this
card up to allow trouble-free movie playing? My video card is an
ATI all-in-wonder pro with 16MB. The PC is a PII/333 with 128MB
RAM.  &mdash;Graham Bell, grahambell@bigfoot.com</p><p>There are many issues when playing video (and audio), not
only in Linux but in other operating systems as well. First, if you
intend to play video from the Internet, such as streaming video,
make sure you get a good connection, the faster the better. This
way, the video quality will improve substantially. There may be
adjustments on your software related to quality of video vs.
video-playback speed: the best image quality may be slower, and
some frames may get lost. Also, be sure to check that the formats
you are trying to play are consistent according to the software you
are using in terms of versions. If your software does not fully
support the video formats you want to play, it may not work as
expected. I would set up all the hardware and make &ldquo;local&rdquo; tests
to ensure everything works fine, then I would go watch on-line
broadcasts.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse, fbarousse@piensa.com</p><p>You did not mention which video program (xanim?) or video
format (avi, mpeg, real video) you are using. There are some known
issues with each format I've mentioned, and the client part
available is somewhat limited. Recently, Real Networks released a
client (RealPlayer) with better Linux support, and it is running
okay.  &mdash;Mario de Mello Bittencourt Neto, mneto@argo.com.br</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1433580.0x152c2c0"></a>Permission to Change</h2></div></div><p>I am connecting a Linux server to a Macintosh. I have
installed Netatalk, and everything seems to be running. When I go
to the Macintosh, I can see the Linux server and access any file I
want from it. However, if I try to save to the Linux server, I get
a message telling me I do not have &ldquo;Make Changes&rdquo; permission and
cannot do that. My Windows 98 machines work fine, so I do not
believe it is a <span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> issue. I
think it is something I am missing in the NetaTalk
configuration.  &mdash;Aime Emery, aemery@northtroyconsulting.com</p><p>It looks like there is a problem related to passwords.
NetaTalk must be compiled with shadow password support if your
Linux uses them. Also, there is a huge variety of options to
configure NetaTalk and all its related protocols. A useful web page

correctly. The problem is consistent with all mail programs I have
tried. Although I am disenchanted with Microsoft, my choice of ISPs
is limited here.  &mdash;Frank Elston, felston@msn.com</p><p>Any ISP that answers the phone for a reasonable price is a
good ISP; there is no shame in using MSN. Try getting your POP
e-mail manually. Run the command <b  >telnet
my.pop.server</b>, where my.pop.server is the POP3 server
given to you by MSN. When you connect, type the command
<b  >USER&nbsp;myusername</b>. Then type the command
<b  >PASS mypassword</b>. If you receive an error at any
point, you will know if you are using the wrong server, user name
and/or password.  &mdash;Chad Robinson, Chad.Robinson@brt.com</p><p>First, are you positive about having POP service contracted
from your local MSN shop? POP3 has several setup parameters; some
of them are security related. Play around with SSL-enabled
connections and test if it works by toggling any of these
configurations. Besides, MSN should provide you with all relevant
information on how to connect to their service, at least from a
Windows PC. From that information, you can take what is needed to
configure your Linux machine.  &mdash;Felipe E. Barousse,
