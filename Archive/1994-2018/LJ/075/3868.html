the anonymity of a big company, being your own boss, and surviving
by your wits. With today's good economy and the growth of Linux,
you may think the time is right to take the plunge. But, do you
know what services to offer in your area? Should you bill by the
hour or by the project? Should you use a broker, or not?
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started in Computer Consulting</em></span>,
written by Peter Meyer, can help you answer these questions and
make your new career a successful one.</p><p>The book does not provide step-by-step instructions for
incorporating, accounting, or the myriad of other details required
for running a business. Neither does it concentrate on things like
marketing or the art of contract writing. Instead, it provides an
overview of a computer consultant's life and gives you general
information you can use to plan and run your business.</p><p>The book starts by explaining a little bit of what computer
consultants do, followed by information on determining what
services you should offer, how you could set up your business and
methods of marketing and pricing your services. It finishes up by
taking you through some of the ethical problems a consultant might
face. The book is a bit uneven in places; some chapters are vague,
while others provide quite a bit of detail.</p><p>A few charts and tables are in the book, including charts
showing hours worked by consultants and consultant income. Many of
the computer and marketing terms used throughout are defined on the
pages where they are used. The book also contains a glossary, which
some people might find helpful. Some web addresses for consulting
organizations and job listings are also given.</p><p>I consider the book's most useful aspect to be the marketing
information provided. It explains how to distinguish yourself to
your potential clients by stressing the benefits they get by hiring
you (e.g., increased sales) instead of the skills you possess
(e.g., database consultant). Mr. Meyer calls this a USP or Unique
Service Proposition, and he provides examples of good ones as well
as not-so-good ones.</p><p>The chapters on determining your rates are also very useful
at the beginning of a consulting career. They help you determine
whether you should charge a flat rate or by the hour, when to raise
your rates, and the signals that high rates send to a client. A
seven-step process is presented for getting a contract at a price
you want for work the client deems important.</p><p>The book provides information on finding out about and
obtaining state and federal government contracts. It also tells you
under which circumstances you can bypass the lengthy bid process to
be awarded a contract quickly.</p><p>One chapter is dedicated to brokers, negotiations and
contracts. It tries to help you decide whether you should use a
broker and what things to look for before choosing one. It explains
the benefits you can get from contracts, and in what situations
they will not help you. Finally, it explains how you can negotiate
with a potential client so that both of you are satisfied with the
outcome.</p><p>Working for clients might not be your only source of income
as a consultant. The book talks about the benefits of writing,
lecturing and creating your own software on the side. In addition
to generating income during slack times, these tasks also serve to
increase your network of contacts and promote name
recognition.</p><p>As a consultant, your most valuable asset is your reputation.
Some common ethical considerations, such as working for competing
clients and what to do if you overbill, are given in the final
chapter. These examples can help you avoid the not-so-obvious
pitfalls you might encounter in the beginning of your consulting
career.</p><p>This book does not provide detailed instructions on starting
and running a business. It does help you decide whether you want to
be a computer consultant, and gives an idea of what you need to
think out ahead of time and plan for in order to become a
successful one. While the book is a little vague in some areas, I
think its discussions of billable hours, marketing services and
determining prices make up for this. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started in
Computer Consulting</em></span> makes a good addition to the
beginning consultant's library.</p></div></div>
