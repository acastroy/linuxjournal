    When you need an embedded operating system, Linux is a good
    place to start. Here's why.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1696580.0x178e558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Intelligent dedicated systems and
appliances used in interface, monitoring, communications and
control applications increasingly demand the services of a
sophisticated, state-of-the-art operating system. Many such systems
require advanced capabilities such as high resolution and
user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs), TCP/IP
connectivity, substitution of reliable (and low-power) flash memory
solid-state disk for conventional disk drives, support for 32-bit
ultra-high-speed CPUs, the use of large memory arrays, and
seemingly infinite capacity storage devices including CD-ROMs and
hard disks. This is not the stuff of yesteryear's &ldquo;stand-alone&rdquo;
code, &ldquo;roll-your-own&rdquo; kernels or &ldquo;plain old DOS&rdquo;. No, those
days are gone&mdash;forever!
</p><p>Then, too, consider the rapidly accelerating pace of hardware
and chipset innovation, accompanied by extremely rapid obsolescence
of the older devices. Combine these two, and you can see why it has
become an enormous challenge for commercial RTOS (real-time
operating system) vendors to keep up with the constant churning of
hardware devices. Supporting the newest devices in a timely
manner&mdash;even just to stay clear of the unrelenting steamroller of
chipset obsolescence&mdash;takes a large and constant resource
commitment. If it's a struggle for the commercial RTOS vendors to
keep up, going it alone by writing stand-alone code or a
roll-your-own kernel certainly makes no sense. With the options
narrowing, embedded system developers find themselves faced with a
dilemma:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>On one hand, today's highly sophisticated and
empowered intelligent embedded systems&mdash;based on the newest chips
and hardware capabilities&mdash;demand nothing less than the power,
sophistication and currency of support provided by a popular
high-end operating system like Windows.</p></li><li><p>On the other hand, embedded systems demand
extremely high reliability (for non-stop, unattended operation)
plus the ability to customize the OS to match an application's
unique requirements.</p></li></ul></div><p>Here's the quandary: general-purpose desktop operating
systems (like Windows) aren't well-suited to the unique needs of
appliance-like embedded systems. However, commercial RTOS, while
designed to satisfy the reliability and configuration flexibility
requirements of embedded applications, are increasingly less
desirable due to their lack of standardization and their inability
to keep pace with the rapid evolution of technology.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1696580.0x178e8c8"></a>The Alternative</h2></div></div><p>Fortunately, an exciting alternative has emerged: open-source
Linux. Linux offers powerful and sophisticated system management
facilities, a rich cadre of device support, a superb reputation for
reliability and robustness and extensive documentation. Best of all
(say system developers), Linux is available with source code at no
charge.</p><p>Unlike Windows, Linux is inherently modular and can be scaled
easily into compact configurations&mdash;barely larger than DOS&mdash;that
can even fit on a single floppy. What's more, since Linux source
code is freely available, it's possible to customize the OS
according to unique embedded system requirements. It's not
surprising, then, that Linux has created a new OS development and
support paradigm in which thousands of developers continually
contribute to a constantly evolving Linux code base. In addition,
dozens of Linux-oriented software companies have sprung up, eager
to support the needs of developers building a wide range of
applications, ranging from factory automation to intelligent
appliances.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1696580.0x178ea28"></a>Which Linux?</h2></div></div><p>Because Linux is openly and freely available in source form,
many variations and configurations are available. There are
implementations specifically for &ldquo;thin server&rdquo; or &ldquo;firewall&rdquo;
applications, small footprint versions and real-time enhanced
versions. There are also Linux ports for non-x86 CPUs, including
PowerPC, RISC, 68<span   class="emphasis"><em>xxx</em></span> and
microcontrollers.</p><p>How do you decide which distribution to use? First, realize
that all Linux distributions are variations on the same theme&mdash;that
is, they are collections of the same basic components, including
the Linux kernel, command shells (command processors) and many
common utilities. The differences tend to center around which of
the many hundreds of Linux utilities have been included, what
extras are included on the distribution CD and how the installation
process is managed. Distributions may include either open-source or
proprietary software such as, for example, StarOffice. Even though
Linux is free, purchasing a &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; Linux distribution can
have many advantages, including development tools, useful utilities
and support. The many companies which are now building businesses
around distributing and supporting Linux are busy investing in
developing tools and services to differentiate their Linux
offerings from the rest of the pack. Some of the special
capabilities being developed include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Installation tools to automate and simplify the
process of generating a Linux configuration that is tuned to a
specific target's hardware setup. These can save weeks or even
months of development effort.</p></li><li><p>A variety of Windows-like GUIs that vary in size,
appearance, features and capabilities to support a wide range of
embedded requirements.</p></li><li><p>Support for the specific needs of various embedded
and real-time computing platforms and environments (e.g., special
CompactPCI system features).</p></li></ul></div><p>Yet despite this great diversity, all Linux implementations
share a common core, including kernel, drivers, several popular
GUIs and utilities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1696580.0x178eea0"></a>Small-Footprint Linux</h2></div></div><p>For many embedded systems, the main challenge in embedding
Linux is to minimize system resource requirements in order to fit
within constraints such as RAM, solid-state disk (SSD), processor
speed and power consumption. Embedded operation may require booting
from (and fitting within) a DiskOnChip or CompactFlash SSD; booting
and running without a display and keyboard (&ldquo;headless&rdquo;
operation); or loading the application from a remote device via an
Ethernet LAN connection. There are many sources of ready-made,
small-footprint Linux. Included among these are a growing number of
application-oriented Linux configurations and distributions that
are tuned to specific applications. Some examples are routers,
firewalls, Internet/network appliances, network servers, gateways,
etc. You may also opt to create your own flavor of embedded Linux,
starting from a standard distribution and leaving out modules you
don't need. Even so, you should consider jump-starting your efforts
by beginning with someone else's working configuration, since the
source code of their version will be available for that purpose.
Best of all, this sort of building on the efforts of others in the
Linux community is not only completely legal&mdash;it's
encouraged!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1696580.0x178efa8"></a>Real-Time Linux</h2></div></div><p>Many embedded systems require predictable and bounded
responses to real-world events. Such &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; systems include
factory automation, data acquisition and control systems,
audio/video applications and many other computerized products and
devices. The commonly accepted definition of real-time performance
is that real-world events must be responded to within a defined,
predictable and relatively short time interval. Although Linux is
not a real-time operating system (the Linux kernel does not provide
the required event prioritization and preemption functions),
several add-on options are available that can bring real-time
capabilities to Linux-based systems. The most common method is the
dual-kernel approach. Using this approach, a general-purpose
(non-real-time) OS runs as a task under a real-time kernel. The
general-purpose OS provides functions such as disk read/write,
LAN/communications, serial/parallel I/O, system initialization,
memory management, etc., while the real-time kernel handles
real-world event processing. You might think of this as a &ldquo;have
your cake and eat it too&rdquo; strategy, because it can preserve the
benefits of a popular general-purpose OS while adding the
capabilities of a real-time OS. In the case of Linux, you can
retain full compatibility with standard Linux while adding
real-time functions in a non-interfering manner.</p><p>Of course, you could also dive in and modify Linux to convert
it into a real-time operating system, since its source is openly
available. But if you do this, you will be faced with the severe
disadvantage of having a real-time Linux that can't keep pace,
either features-wise or drivers-wise, with mainstream Linux. In
short, your customized Linux won't benefit from the continual Linux
evolution that results from the pooled efforts of thousands of
developers worldwide.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1696580.0x178f108"></a>Who Needs Real-Time?</h2></div></div><p>In any case, how many applications actually require real-time
enhancements to Linux? Bear in mind that &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; is a
relative, not an absolute, expression. As mentioned before, a
real-time system must handle real-world tasks within
acceptable&mdash;and predictable&mdash;time windows. Although CPUs run at
ever-increasing speeds (approaching 1GHz), the world around them
goes on at a constant speed. Therefore, real-time performance is
becoming ever easier to achieve. Back when the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; RTOS
were first developed, embedded systems depended on 4- and 8-bit
CPUs clocked at single-digit megahertz speeds and running out of
kilobytes of RAM. Now, with CPUs speeding along at up to 1GHz and
with memories measured in the hundreds of megabytes, real-time
performance is becoming less of a concern. The greater concern has
become speed to market and sophistication of functionality. Where
execution efficiency was the watchword of the CPU-bound past,
protocols are the key to the Internet-centric future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1696580.0x178f210"></a>Going Soft</h2></div></div><p>There's a term to describe the use of ordinary operating
systems in real-world applications with acceptable results: &ldquo;soft
real-time&rdquo;. In many systems, you can ensure that the real-world
constraints of your application can be achieved without resorting
to using a specialized RTOS. However, this tends to be practical
only when required response times are in milliseconds&mdash;not
microseconds. Assuming that's the case, a minimally configured
Linux on a reasonably fast processor (486-133 or faster) without
special real-time add-ons may well suit your needs. If soft
real-time sounds like what you need, you may want to check out a
Linux add-on called Linux-SRT (soft real-time). On the other hand,
your system may indeed require microsecond-level response times. In
that case, you can either dedicate an inexpensive microcontroller
or DSP to handling the time-critical events, or you can use one of
several available real-time Linux add-ons (e.g., RTLinux or
RTAI).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1696580.0x178f318"></a>Embedded and Real-Time Linux Solution
Providers</h2></div></div><p>Since Linux is free, how can anyone build a profitable
business based on offering commercial Linux distributions? It's a
lot like bottled water&mdash;basically, what you pay for is services:
packaging, delivery, quality assurance, etc. A word of caution:
don't assume that every Linux-related program you download from the
Web or obtain from a Linux CD can be freely reproduced and
incorporated into the devices you develop. Some commercial Linux
distributions that target embedded and real-time applications
include proprietary third-party tools and utilities that require
licensing and royalty payments if you incorporate them into
multiple systems. In other words, read the fine print. For now,
however, licensed Linux system software is the exception rather
than the rule. With the market placing such a high value on Linux
and its associated software being open source and royalty-free,
most Linux software companies serving the embedded and real-time
Linux market have opted to build their businesses based on selling
tools, offering engineering services and providing technical
support.</p><p>Given the strong position of Microsoft Windows in the
end-user desktop/laptop market, it's unlikely the &ldquo;average&rdquo;
desktop/laptop PC user will be running Linux any time soon. On the
other hand, in embedded and real-time applications where the OS is
an underlying and hidden technology supporting appliance-like
operation of a non-computer device, several key features of Linux
are making it a growing preference among system developers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Source is available and free.</p></li><li><p>There are no runtime royalties.</p></li><li><p>Linux supports a vast array of devices.</p></li><li><p>Linux is truly a global standard.</p></li><li><p>Linux is sophisticated, efficient, robust,
reliable, modular and highly configurable.</p></li></ul></div><p>Time will tell, but it certainly looks as though Linux has
already altered the embedded and real-time operating system
landscape in a fundamental and irreversible way. The result?
Developers now have greater control over their embedded OS;
manufacturers are spared the costs and headaches of software
royalties; end users get more value. And the penguins of the South
Pole are celebrating.
