    How to use the mechanism provided by the IA32 architecture
    for handling system calls.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x15a8660"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article aims to give the reader,
either a kernel novice or a seasoned programmer, a better
understanding of the dynamics of system calls in Linux. Wherever
code sections are mentioned, I refer to the 2.3.52 (soon to be 2.4)
series of kernels unless otherwise noted.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x15a8768"></a>The Linux Kernel in Brief</h2></div></div><p>The most widespread CPU architecture is the IA32, a.k.a. x86,
which is the architecture of the 386, 486, the Pentiums I, Pro, II
and III, AMD's competing K6 and Athlon lines, plus CPUs from others
such as VIA/Cyrix and Integrated Device Technologies. Because it is
the most widespread, it will be taken as the illustrative example
here. First, I will cover the mechanisms provided by the IA32 type
of CPU for handling system calls, and then show how Linux uses
those mechanisms. To review a few broad terms:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A <span   class="bold"><b>kernel</b></span> is the
operating system software running in protected mode and having
access to the hardware's privileged registers. The kernel is not a
separate process running on the system. It is the guts of the
operating system, which controls the scheduling of processes to
achieve multitasking, and provides a set of routines, constantly in
memory, to which every user-space process has access.</p></li><li><p>Some operating systems employ a
<span   class="bold"><b>microkernel architecture</b></span>, wherein
device drivers and other code are loaded and executed on demand and
are not necessarily always in memory.</p></li><li><p>A <span   class="bold"><b>monolithic
architecture</b></span> is more common among UNIX implementations;
it is the design employed by classic designs such as BSD.</p></li></ul></div><p>The Linux kernel is mostly a monolithic kernel: i.e., all
device drivers are part of the kernel proper. Unlike BSD, a Linux
kernel's device drivers can be &ldquo;loadable&rdquo;, i.e., they can be
loaded and unloaded from memory through user commands.
</p><p>Basically, multitasking is accomplished in this way: the
kernel switches control between processes rapidly, using the clock
interrupt (and other means) to trigger a switch from one process to
another. When a hardware device issues an interrupt, the interrupt
handler is found within the kernel. When a process takes an action
that requires it to wait for results, the kernel steps in and puts
the process into an appropriate sleeping or waiting state and
schedules another process in its place.</p><p>Besides multitasking, the kernel also contains the routines
which implement the interface between user programs and hardware
devices, virtual memory, file management and many other aspects of
the system.</p><p>Kernel routines to achieve all of the above can be called
from user-space code in a number of ways. One direct method to
utilize the kernel is for a process to execute a system call. There
are 116 system calls; documentation for these can be found in the
man pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x15a8d40"></a>System Calls and Event Classes on the
IA32</h2></div></div><p>A system call is a request by a running task to the kernel to
provide some sort of service on its behalf. In general, the kernel
services invoked by system calls comprise an abstraction layer
between hardware and user-space programs, allowing a programmer to
implement an operating environment without having to tailor his
program(s) too specifically to one single brand or precise specific
combination of system hardware components. System calls also serve
this generalization function across programming languages; e.g.,
the <span   class="bold"><b>read</b></span> system call will read
data from a file descriptor. To the programmer, this looks like
another C function, but in actuality, the code for read is
contained within the kernel.</p><p>The IA32 CPU recognizes two classes of events needing special
processor attention: interrupts and exceptions. Both cause a forced
context switch to a new procedure or task.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x15a8ef8"></a>Interrupts</h2></div></div><p>Interrupts can occur at unexpected times during the execution
of a program and are used to respond to signals; they are signals
that processor attention is needed from hardware. When a hardware
device issues an interrupt, the interrupt handler is found within
the kernel. Next month, we will discuss interrupts in more
detail.</p><p>Two sources of interrupts are recognized by the IA32:
maskable interrupts, for which vectors are determined by the
hardware, and non-maskable interrupts (NMI Interrupts, or
NMIs).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x15a9058"></a>Exceptions</h2></div></div><p>Exceptions are either processor-detected or issued (thrown)
from software. When a procedure or method encounters an abnormal
condition (an exception condition) it can't handle, it may throw an
exception. Exceptions of either type are caught by handler routines
(<b  >_exception handlers_</b>) positioned along the
thread's procedure or method invocation stack. This may be the
calling procedure or method, or if that doesn't include code to
handle the exception condition, its calling procedure or method and
so on. If one of the threads of your program throws an exception
that isn't caught by any procedure (or method), then that thread
will expire.</p><p>An exception tells a calling procedure that an abnormal
(though not necessarily rare) condition has occurred, e.g., a
method was invoked with an invalid argument. When you throw an
exception, you are performing a kind of structured &ldquo;go to&rdquo; from
the place in your program where the abnormal condition was detected
to a place where it can be handled. Exception handlers should be
stationed at program-module levels in accordance with how general a
range of errors each is capable of handling in such a way that as
few exception handlers as possible will cover as wide a variety of
exceptions as are going to be encountered in field application of
your programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x15a9210"></a>An Example of Exceptions as Objects from
Java</h2></div></div><p>In Java, exceptions are objects. In addition to throwing
objects whose class is declared in java.lang, you can throw objects
of your own design. To create your own class of throwable objects,
you need to declare it as a subclass of some member of the
<b  >Throwable</b> family. In general, however, the
throwable classes you define should extend class
<b  >Exception</b>--they should be &ldquo;exceptions&rdquo;.
Usually, the class of the exception object indicates the type of
abnormal condition encountered. For example, if a thrown exception
object has class <b  >illegalArgumentException</b>, that
indicates someone passed an illegal argument to a method.</p><p>When you throw an exception, you instantiate and throw an
object whose class, declared in java.lang, descends from
<b  >Throwable</b>, which has two direct subclasses:
<b  >Exception</b> and <b  >Error</b>. Errors
(members of the <b  >Error</b> family) are usually thrown
for more serious problems, such as
<b  >OutOfMemoryError</b>, that may not be easy to
handle. Errors are usually thrown by the methods of the Java API or
the Java Virtual Machine. In general, code you write should throw
only exceptions, not errors.</p><p>The Java Virtual Machine uses the class of the exception
object to decide which catch clause, if any, should be allowed to
handle the exception. The catch clause can also get information on
the abnormal condition by querying the exception object directly
for information you embedded in it during instantiation (before
throwing it). The Exception class allows you to specify a detailed
message as a string that can be retrieved by invoking
<span   class="bold"><b>getMessage</b></span> on the exception
object.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x15a96e0"></a>Vectors</h2></div></div><p>Each IA32 interrupt or exception has a number, which is
referred to in the IA32 literature as its
<span   class="emphasis"><em>vector</em></span>. The NMI interrupt and the
processor-detected exceptions have been assigned vectors in the
range 0 through 31, inclusive. The vectors for maskable interrupts
are determined by the hardware. External interrupt controllers put
the vector on the bus during the interrupt-acknowledge cycle. Any
vector in the range 32 through 255, inclusive, can be used for
maskable interrupts or programmed exceptions.</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>startup_32</b></span> code found in
/usr/src/linux/boot/head.S starts everything off at boot time by
calling <span   class="bold"><b>setup_idt</b></span>. This routine
sets up an IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table) with 256 entries, each
four bytes long, total 1024 bytes, offsets 0-255. It should be
noted that the IDT contains vectors to both interrupt handlers and
exception handlers, so &ldquo;IDT&rdquo; is something of a misnomer, but
that's the way it is.</p><p>No interrupt entry points are actually loaded by startup_32,
as that is done only after paging has been enabled and the kernel
has been relocated to 0xC000000. At times, mostly during boot, the
kernel must be loaded into certain addresses, because the
underlying BIOS architecture demands it. After control is passed to
the kernel exclusively, the Linux kernel can put itself wherever it
wants. Usually this is very high up in memory, but below the 2GB
limit.</p><p>When <span   class="bold"><b>start_kernel</b></span> (found in
/usr/src/linux/init/main.c) is called, it invokes
<span   class="bold"><b>trap_init</b></span> (found in
/usr/src/linux/kernel/traps.c).
<span   class="bold"><b>trap_init</b></span> sets up the IDT via the
macro <span   class="bold"><b>set_trap_gate</b></span> (found in
/usr/include/asm/system.h) and initializes the interrupt descriptor
table as shown in the &ldquo;Offset Descriptionis&rdquo; table.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x15a9b58"></a>Offset Descriptions</h2></div></div><p><a href="4048t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><p>At this point, the interrupt vector for the system calls is
not set up. It is initialized by
<span   class="bold"><b>sched_init</b></span> (found in
/usr/src/linux/kernel/sched.c). To set interrupt 0x80 to be a
vector to the <span   class="bold"><b>_system_call</b></span> entry
point, call:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set_system_gate (0x80, &amp;system_call)
</pre><p>The priority of simultaneously seen interrupts and exceptions
is shown in the sidebar &ldquo;Runtime Priority of Interrupts&rdquo;.
</p><p><a href="4048s1.html" target="_self">Runtime Priority of
Interrupts</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x19a2170"></a>The System Call Interface</h2></div></div><p>The Linux system call interface is vectored through a stub in
libc (often glibc) and is exclusively &ldquo;register-parametered&rdquo;,
i.e., the stack is not used for parameter passing. Each call within
the libc library is generally a syscall<span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>
macro, where <span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> is the number of parameters
used by the actual routine. Under Linux, the execution of a system
call is invoked by a maskable interrupt or exception class transfer
(e.g., &ldquo;throwing&rdquo; an exception object), caused by the instruction
in 0x80. Vector 0x80 is used to transfer control to the kernel.
This interrupt vector is initialized during system startup, along
with other important vectors such as the system clock vector. On
the assembly level (in user space), it looks like Listing 1.
Nowadays, this code is contained in the glibc2.1 library. 0x80 is
hardcoded into both Linux and glibc, to be the system call number
which transfers control to the kernel. At bootup, the kernel has
set up the IDT vector 0x80 to be a &ldquo;call gate&rdquo; (see
arch/i386/kernel/traps.c:trap_init):</p><p><a href="4048l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><pre     class="programlisting">
set_system_gate(SYSCALL_VECTOR,&amp;system_call)
</pre><p>The vector layout is defined in include/asm-i386/hw_irq.h.
</p><p>Not until the int <b  >$0x80</b> is executed does
the call transfer to the kernel entry point _system_call. This
entry point is the same for all system calls. It is responsible for
saving all registers, checking to make sure a valid system call was
invoked, then ultimately transferring control to the actual system
call code via the offsets in the
<b  >_sys_call_table</b>. It is also responsible for
calling <span   class="bold"><b>_ret_from_sys_call</b></span> when
the system call has been completed, but before returning to user
space.</p><p>Actual code for the system_call entry point can be found in
/usr/src/linux/kernel/sys_call.S and the code for many of the
system calls can be found in /usr/src/linux/kernel/sys.c. Code for
the rest is distributed throughout the source files. Some system
calls, like <span   class="bold"><b>fork</b></span>, have their own
source file (e.g., kernel/fork.c).</p><p>The next instruction the CPU executes after the int
<b  >$0x80</b> is the <b  >pushl %eax</b> in
<span   class="bold"><b>entry.S:system_call</b></span>. There, we
first save all user-space registers, then we range-check
<b  >%eax</b> and call
<b  >sys_call_table[%eax]</b>, which is the actual system
call.</p><p>Since the system call interface is exclusively
register-parametered, six parameters at most can be used with a
single system call. <b  >%eax</b> is the syscall number;
<b  >%ebx</b>, <b  >%ecx</b>,
<b  >%edx</b>, <b  >%esi</b>,
<b  >%edi</b> and <b  >%ebp</b> are the six
generic registers used as param0-5; and <b  >%esp</b>
cannot be used because it's overwritten by the kernel when it
enters ring 0 (i.e., kernel mode).</p><p>In case more parameters are needed, some structure can be
placed wherever you want within your address space and pointed to
from a register (not the instruction pointer, nor the stack
pointer; the kernel-space functions use the stack for parameters
and local variables). This case is extremely rare, though; most
system calls have either no parameters or only one.</p><p>Once the system call returns, we check one or more status
flags in the process structure; the exact number will depend on the
system call. <span   class="bold"><b>creat</b></span> might leave a
dozen flags (existing, created, locked, etc.), whereas a
<span   class="bold"><b>sync</b></span> might return only one.</p><p>If no work is pending, we restore user-space registers and
return to user space via <b  >iret</b>. The next
instruction after the <b  >iret</b> is the user-space
<b  >popl %ebx</b> instruction shown in Listing 1.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x19a2e80"></a>More Complex System Calls</h2></div></div><p>Some system calls are more complex then others because of
variable-length argument lists. Examples of a complex system call
include <span   class="bold"><b>open</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ioctl</b></span>. However, even complex
system calls must use the same entry point; they just have more
overhead for parameter setup. Each syscall macro expands to an
assembly routine which sets up the calling stack frame and calls
_system_call through an interrupt, via the instruction int $0x80.
For example, the setuid system call is coded as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
_syscall1(int,setuid,uid_t,uid)
</pre><p>which expands to the assembly code shown in Listing 2.
</p><p><a href="4048l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x19a3198"></a>The User-Space System Call Code Library</h2></div></div><p>The user-space call code library can be found in
/usr/src/libc/syscall. The hard-coding of the parameter layout and
actual system call numbers is not a problem, because system calls
are never really changed; they are only &ldquo;introduced&rdquo; and
&ldquo;obsoleted&rdquo;. An obsoleted system call is marked with the
<b  >old_</b> prefix in the system call table for
entry.S, and reference to it is removed from the next glibc. Once
no application uses that system call anymore, its slot is marked
&ldquo;unused&rdquo; and is potentially reusable for a newly introduced
system call.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x19a32f8"></a>Tracing System Calls</h2></div></div><p>If a user wishes to trace a program, it is equally important
to know what happens during system calls. Thus, the trace of a
program usually includes a trace through the system calls as well.
This is done through <b  >SIGSTOP</b> and
<b  >SIGCHLD</b> ping-ponging between parent (tracing
process) and child (traced process). When a traced process is
executed, every system call is preceded by a
<span   class="bold"><b>sys_ptrace</b></span> call. This makes the
traced process send a SIGCHILD to the tracing process each time a
system call is made. The traced process immediately enters the
<b  >TASK_STOPPED</b> state (a flag is set in the
task_struct structure). The tracing process can then examine the
entire address space of the traced process through the use of
<span   class="bold"><b>_ptrace</b></span>, which is a multi-purpose
system call. The tracing process sends a SIGSTOP to allow execution
again.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14b0580.0x19a35b8"></a>How to Add Your Own System Calls</h2></div></div><p>Adding your own system calls is actually quite easy. Follow
this list of steps to do so. Remember, if you do not make these
system calls available on all the machines you want your program to
run on, the result will be non-portable code.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Create a directory under the /usr/src/linux/
directory to hold your code.</p></li><li><p>Put any include files in /usr/include/sys/ and
/usr/include/linux/.</p></li><li><p>Add the relocatable module produced by the link of
your new kernel code to the <b  >ARCHIVES</b> and the
subdirectory to the <b  >SUBDIRS</b> lines of the
top-level Makefile. See fs/Makefile, target fs.o for an
example.</p></li><li><p>Add a <b  >#define
__NR_<i><tt>xx</tt></i></b> to unistd.h to assign
a call number for your system call, where <span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span>,
the index, is something descriptive relating to your system call.
It will be used to set up the vector through sys_call_table to
invoke your code.</p></li><li><p>Add an entry point for your system call to the
sys_call_table in sys.h. It should match the index
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>xx</em></span>) you assigned in the previous step.</p></li><li><p>The NR_syscalls variable will be recalculated
automatically.</p></li><li><p>Modify any kernel code in kernel/fs/mm/, etc. to
take into account the environment needed to support your new
code.</p></li><li><p>Run <b  >make</b> from the top source
code directory level to produce the new kernel incorporating your
new code.</p></li></ul></div><p>At this point, you must either add a syscall to your
libraries, or use the proper
<span   class="bold"><b>_syscalln</b></span> macro in your user
program in order for your programs to access the new system call.
