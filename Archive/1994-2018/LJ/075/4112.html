that uses what may be the most popular teen application of our
time: instant messaging. Lately, IM has become a hot topic, not so
much because it's such a hot application (which it is), but because
AOL seems hell-bent on dominating the category. For years, the
company has been bundling AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) with not only
their own proprietary on-line software, but with every copy of the
Netscape browser. AOL also owns ICQ, the popular IM system
developed by Mirabalis in Israel a few years back.
</p><p>According to Tapan Joshi, the president of AWZ.com, AOL is
trying to dominate IM the old-fashioned way: by working (both in
software and the courts) to keep anyone else's instant-messaging
software from interoperating with AOL's, regardless of the
inconvenience this causes to AOL's own customers. In an April 27
op-ed piece in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>San Jose Mercury News</em></span>,
Joshi lamented it isn't just Microsoft and Yahoo! that AOL wants to
keep away from AIM and ICQ. It's little guys like AWZ.com.</p><p>Reading the piece brought to mind the last conversation I had
with another IM pioneer: Udi Shapiro. It was in early 1998, not
long after Udi had bought his company, Ubique, back from AOL. The
on-line giant originally acquired Ubique for its technology, which
subsumed and transcended &ldquo;chat&rdquo;, &ldquo;buddy lists&rdquo;, &ldquo;instant
messaging&rdquo; and the other stuff AOL was also busy building into a
Ubique competitor, the now-hyperfamiliar AIM. When it became clear
that Ubique was getting the short shrift at AOL, Udi quietly
repurchased the company, searched around for a proper benefactor,
and found one in IBM's Lotus Development Corp. LDC purchased Ubique
in May 1998 and now sells its technology as Lotus Sametime (which
<span   class="emphasis"><em>PC Magazine</em></span> rates ahead of AIM, by the way).
Meanwhile, Udi is back where he started, at the Weissman Institute
in Israel, working on computational and biochemical theories of the
origin of life and stuff like that.</p><p>I'm glad I had that one lunch with Udi, back there between
AOL and Lotus. During that lunch, Udi said the main lesson he
learned at AOL was that instant messaging &ldquo;changed the sociology
of telephony&rdquo; at any company that used it widely. Thanks to the
buddy list in AIM, it became bad form at AOL corporate headquarters
to bother a co-worker with a trivial call when a trivial instant
message would do a better job. &ldquo;Got a minute to talk?&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Where are you going for lunch?&rdquo; were better asked on the instant
messenger than on the phone. New manners developed for both phone
and IM. It was a remarkable development, Udi reported. Typically,
this realization was mostly irrelevant to AOL's own concept for
AIM, which was to serve as a frame for advertising messages
delivered to the service's heaviest users: teenage girls chatting
about boys and homework.</p><p>The next visionary to deliver insights to me about instant
messaging was my friend Perry Evans, best known in our industry as
the creator of Mapquest and to the rest of the world as the guy
whose idea it was to create flavored bite-sized shredded wheat (or
something like that), when he was a hungry kid working for Nabisco.
Now the president and CEO of Webb.net, Perry let me know over
drinks in Denver last year that he and Webb were doing for
next-generation instant messaging roughly what Transmeta did for
Linux, which was to give its progenitor a day job.</p><p>The Linus Torvalds of next-generation instant messaging&mdash;and
a low-profile employee of Webb.net&mdash;is Jeremie Miller, a quiet,
modest and brilliant programmer who lives in the farm country of
Iowa. Jeremie's Linux is Jabber, &ldquo;an open-source, cross-platform,
completely extensible, end-all to Instant Messaging as we know
it&rdquo;, or so says the FAQ at the Jabber.org web site. But it's more
than that. To understand how much more, you have to know two
things.</p><p>First, instant messaging as we know it&mdash;almost entirely
through AIM and ICQ&mdash;is a client/mainframe affair. When you're on
an AIM client, you're hooked into exactly one server, in Vienna,
Virginia. When you're on an ICQ client, you have the same
relationship to another singular server. Same with Excite and
Yahoo! That's four services, four giant servers and nearly zero
interoperability between them&mdash;just like it was in the good old
days of dial-up bulletin board services and on-line services. To be
fair, Microsoft's MSN Messenger and Lotus's Sametime are both
client/server systems. You can buy and deploy them on a
server-by-server basis. But every one of these systems offers
nothing in the way of real Internet Infrastructure, since they're
as proprietary as a company boardroom and as open as a
brick.</p><p>Second, about all most of us know so far about instant
messaging are the three features we associate with AIM and ICQ:
buddy lists, chat and instant messages. We'd also rather ignore
AIM's and ICQ's other agendas, which are to serve as consumer
marketing vehicles for branding, advertising or both.</p><p>Jabber is a totally different animal. Here's the way Perry
put it when he blew my mind back in Denver: &ldquo;Jabber puts a living
XML document in the middle of a real-time conversation.&rdquo; That
means the content of an instant dialogue can be much more than
typed text. For example, it can be a legal brief, collaboratively
edited by a number of lawyers in a firm. It can be a live auction,
with bids published for everyone in real time. It can be a repair
history for your car, viewed by you and your dealer on your
computers while you talk over the phone. It can be, well, just
about anything.</p><p>On top of that, Jabber is completely XML-based, open source
and deployed as an infrastructural service on the Net. An
enterprise, a household or an ISP could have a Jabber server, just
like they have a domain name server, a web server or a mail-hosting
service. What's more, Jabber translates to any familiar
instant-messaging flavor, including ICQ, AIM, IRC, MSN and the
emerging IETF/IMPP protocol. Everyone can use their own client if
they like, or they can use a Jabber client. Want more? Jabber also
features message filtering, MIME encoding, crypto (e.g., OpenPGP)
and game communication. Webb's Andre Durand, founder of Durand
Communications and now general manager of Jabber.com, Inc. (a
subsidiary of Webb) describes Jabber as &ldquo;a real-time router for
XML documents that has the potential to bridge not just proprietary
IM networks, but wireless devices, embedded systems and a whole
slew of new, real-time messaging-based applications which have yet
to be developed.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You can create all kinds of applications that run on
Jabber,&rdquo; Perry says. &ldquo;Voice-over IP integration, software
development collaboration, community buying aggregation, auction
and reverse auction systems, enterprise groupware&mdash;the list just
goes on and on.&rdquo;</p><p>Right now, Jabber's profile is still low. It's kind of like
Mosaic before it was released by Marc Andreessen and his buddies at
the University of Illinois. (You can find an early Jabber version
deployed at Corel, if you want to start trying it out.) But a
groundswell is building. In February, when I was on an open-source
panel at the New York New Media Association, Daniel Frye of IBM
began gushing about Jabber in a way that put even my own enthusiasm
to shame.</p><p>So clearly, this is a space to watch. Unfortunately, Mr.
Joshi of AWZ.com isn't watching closely enough. In his op-ed piece,
he correctly calls AOL's belligerence &ldquo;short-sighted&rdquo; and
instructs the company to &ldquo;look no farther than the Linux operating
system.&rdquo; He predicts &ldquo;it is very likely that AOL is going to
learn the Linux lesson the hard way.&rdquo; But he misses Jabber.</p><p>Jabber will teach the lesson, but it won't be hard for
anyone. That's because Jabber doesn't compete with AOL or anyone
else. It simply enlarges their scope. &ldquo;I look at instant messaging
as a wild frontier,&rdquo; Jeremie says. &ldquo;Right now, there is nobody
around. We're free to build all kinds of stuff, and everybody else
is free to add value to what we're doing.&rdquo; Sound familiar? Keep
watching, or go to the developer section of Jabber.org and see what
you can do for the cause.</p></div></div>
