    <i  >LJ</i>'s French chef visits Montr&eacute;al April 10-12 for more than

science-fiction convention, put up your hand. Go ahead, admit
it&mdash;this is a friendly crowd. SF convention goers have a term that
describes conventions like the Montr&eacute;al Linux Expo:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Relaxcon.</em></span> This term refers to a quiet
convention, one where you can basically just relax and chat with
people. While this is great for fans wanting to get close to their
idols, businesses and exhibitors spending several thousand dollars
for a booth may have other ideas&mdash;even in the world of free
software. Don't get me wrong. On Tuesday, day one of the show, the
place was hopping and you could feel the excitement at the Palais
des Congr&eacute;s. All in all, it was a fairly successful opening
day, especially considering the weather. Wednesday, however, was a
different matter. The general consensus from the vendors I spoke to
on Wednesday was that day two might just as well have not happened,
considering the number of people in attendance. For those of you
who missed the show, let me try to paint you a picture.
</p><p>Ah yes, the weather. We arrived in Montr&eacute;al during
what was probably the worst snowstorm of the winter. We left
Mississauga with the sun shining and temperatures of 10 degrees
Celsius. Around Brockville (about two-thirds of the way there),
things got ugly as the blizzard set in. Our six-hour trip turned
into the ten-hour drive from hell. Attendance may have been light
due to the great dump of snow, but I certainly don't think the
weather can be blamed for everything. The organizers expected 6000.
One Montr&eacute;al newspaper estimated slightly over 4500. Another
paper, this one in Ottawa, cynically proclaimed, &ldquo;barely 300 there
for the key speeches&rdquo;. I'll step out on a limb, double that number
for the key speeches, and guesstimate 2500 to 3000
attendees.</p><p>Each of the keynotes was held on the first day of the Expo,
Tuesday. The notables were Corel's Michael Cowpland, Red Hat's Bob
Young, MandrakeSoft's Jacques Le Marois, SuSE's Dirk Hohndel,
Oracle Corp., Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall and Eric S. Raymond. Linuxconf
author Jacques G&eacute;linas introduced the last two speakers,
while Jean-Claude Gu&eacute;don, professor of comparative
literature at the University of Montr&eacute;al and author of the
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>La Plan&egrave;te Cyber</em></span> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cyber
Planet</em></span>), moderated and introduced the keynotes.</p><p>Linux aficionados have already heard much of what was said in
the keynotes, but there were some comments worth noting. Professor
Gu&eacute;don pointed out that his part in this Expo was partly
that of an interested observer, a chronicler of a new direction in
the history of the high-tech world&mdash;the Linux revolution. He
suggested that &ldquo;a Linux company is a bit like a scientist, because
a scientist is a kind of intellectual entrepreneur.&rdquo; This fit well
with Eric Raymond's speech on the value of peer review in any
intellectual enterprise. He explained to the audience that
pseudo-sciences like alchemy took the next evolutionary step toward
true science only when the work of the scientist (the source) was
finally opened to public scrutiny and peer review (the open model
of which Linux and GNU are the poster children). Based on the
centuries of success of this approach, Mr. Raymond said he did not
know what the future held, but he could tell us with near absolute
certainty that &ldquo;You ain't seen nothin' yet!&rdquo;</p><p>Red Hat's Bob Young made an interesting analogy comparing
closed-source software to the feudal system, where serfs paid for a
plot of land for the privilege of working on it. He pointed out
that with certain closed-software distributions, you might even
risk going to jail for improving it, which would require that you
somehow gained access to this highly guarded source or intellectual
property. Whatever your motives, you still lose.</p><p>SuSE's CTO, Dirk Hohndel, likened the competition in the
Linux marketplace to a friendly battle of wits, with companies
smiling at each other while they try to outsmart each other. The
great thing about Linux, he said, could be summed up in these
points:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It is a dream come true.</p></li><li><p>It actually works.</p></li><li><p>It's fun to be part of.</p></li></ul></div><p>Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall, one of the legends of Linux and the Open
Source movement, gave a talk entitled &ldquo;Life in the Elevator&rdquo;.
Unfortunately, it was delayed by hardware problems, and Mr. Hall
called for recess while he hunted down his own notebook. The
premise of his speech is that you enter the elevator at the bottom
floor of a high-rise. Inside this elevator is a person with whom
you have one minute to chat. In that one minute, they can ask any
question about Linux (for instance, &ldquo;What is it with the penguin,
anyway?&rdquo;). Mr. Hall had 15 questions in all. In that minute-long
ride, you have to be able to answer any of 15 questions he
presented. After each answer, Mr. Hall would declare, &ldquo;And that's
another minute.&rdquo;
</p><p>In some ways, that forced recess was a lucky break for me. In
those few minutes, I caught up with Dirk Hohndel before he moved on
to his next engagement. I must tell you I was already impressed
with Mr. Hohndel's presentation, professionalism and support for
his colleagues (and competitors) during his keynote address. In
stopping for an informal chat, he proved genuine. After a brief
introduction, I asked him what he has been up to and where SuSE was
going.</p><p>&ldquo;We are very happy with SuSE's position in the
marketplace,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;With the release of our SuSE 6.4,
we've achieved a 95% first-time install success.&rdquo; He explained
that this was partly due to SuSE's new
<span   class="bold"><b>YaST2</b></span> graphical installation tool.
&ldquo;Automatic hardware detection has become extremely simple.&rdquo; For
the 5% or so of installs that might miss something, SuSE still
offers the old text-based install with more configuration options.
Release 6.4 also includes a preview of XFree86 4.0, though it is
not the default configuration. Mr. Hohndel said that, as one of the
developers on the project, he feels this next step in X technology
is important and should get as much exposure as possible.</p><p>When I asked about the future at SuSE, Mr. Hohndel said, &ldquo;We
are concentrating on two areas primarily: the desktop and
enterprise computing.&rdquo; SuSE feels that the desktop is extremely
important to Linux's success and as such was an early supporter of
the KDE project and continues to be supportive of KDE2. In fact,
four of the developers on the KDE project now work at SuSE. Still,
before KDE, you need X. Here's a sneak peek at the future of the
desktop from SuSE. Their new graphical configuration tool for X,
named <span   class="bold"><b>SaX2</b></span>, is the next
evolutionary step in simple, dynamic X setup and configuration.
With SaX2, SuSE hopes to make the dreaded task of X configuration
and tweaking a thing of the past.</p><p>On the enterprise side, SuSE is increasingly providing
services to Fortune 100 companies with data centers and support.
(SuSE has their own support organization.) They are developing
technology partnerships in a number of areas. Mr. Hohndel mentioned
one such partnership with SGI, where they are building a framework
dedicated to bringing high-availability clustering to the Linux
world. &ldquo;This is the kind of support that large companies want to
see developed in Linux,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>The main show floor had quite a variety of exhibitors, from
Linux organizations to Linux companies and other things in between
(and, of course, <i  >Linux Journal</i>). There was a
great concentration of knowledge (special thanks to the Red Hat
folks for answering a niggling question regarding parallel-port
weirdness in a 6.1 install), and one or two companies that didn't
seem to understand that they were, in fact, selling Linux products.
&ldquo;Oh, no, this isn't Linux at all. It is a Linux server that offers
.... &rdquo; Okay, whatever.</p><p>All in all, Linux Expo Montr&eacute;al was great fun and I
thoroughly enjoyed myself, but I think it could have been much
better. Wise and infallible in the ways of marketing I am not, but
I do have some ideas as to what went wrong. It wasn't such a large
Expo that visitors couldn't wander through most displays in a day.
Combine this with the fact that the only other free items on the
program, the keynotes, were all bundled into a three-hour session
on the first day, and I think we begin to see the problem. Simply
put, if you were there on the first day, why bother coming back
unless you had dropped the big bucks to attend?</p><p>Another problem can be best summed up anecdotally.</p><p>One of the things I did on my visit was deliver a computer to
my parents, a computer running Linux with a K desktop. My parents
are complete computer newbies, but I am convinced that Linux will
be as easy for them to use as &ldquo;that other OS&rdquo;. Not only that, it
will be more reliable (read <span   class="emphasis"><em>fewer support
calls</em></span> for me). Anyway, after the show, I stopped at a
local bookstore (Camelot.ca, which happened to have a booth at the
Expo under Addison Wesley's banner). While waiting at the checkout
with my father's Linux reference book in hand, a university student
stood in front of me paying for a Shockwave book. He looked over at
me, saw the book, and asked me about Linux (note to Jon
Hall&mdash;include checkouts at malls in next talk). I explained that I
had been at Linux Expo.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn't know there was a Linux Expo in town. When and
where is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually, today is the last day, at the Palais des
Congr&eacute;s,&rdquo; I said. It was already two o'clock.</p><p>&ldquo;That's too bad. I would have liked to have gone. How did
you find out about it?&rdquo;</p><p>This guy is working with computers in a university. It occurs
to me that the university computer-science crowd would have been a
perfect target audience. Microsoft and IBM know this well and do
their best to make sure university computer-science graduates know
about their products. Why couldn't the Sky Events people figure
that one out? Where did all the advertising go? I was invited, as
were others who are already among the converted, but what about the
people who are still discovering Linux, who may want to learn more?
Who else did they miss in this way?</p><p>Sky Events is already advertising next year's Montr&eacute;al
Linux Expo. Heading down the escalators as I left the show, I
noticed banners proudly proclaiming Linux Expo 2001&mdash;more or less
same penguin-time, same penguin-channel. I hope Sky Events will
take the lessons from this year's conference and turn next year's
event into an even more exciting presentation. Linux Expo in
Montr&eacute;al was great fun, and there is no better place in
North America to eat than Montr&eacute;al (trust me, gentle
readers, the food is amazing). It would have been nice, however, to
see more faces there.</p></div></div>
