    NM Tech studies lightning to determine basic charge
    structures and learn more about storm morphology.

Technology (NM Tech) has developed a deployable system for mapping
the lightning discharge activity of thunderstorms in three spatial
dimensions and time. The array, which utilizes Global Positioning
System (GPS) technology for accurate timing and is patterned after
the Lightning Detection and Ranging system developed and utilized
by NASA's Kennedy Space Center, is known as the Lightning Mapping
Array (LMA) and consists of 10 to 15 stations deployed about a
county-wide area of approximately 30-50km in diameter.
</p><p>Each station detects and accurately times the arrival of
impulsive VHF (very high frequency) events in a 6MHz passband
centered at 63MHz. The time and magnitude of the impulsive
radiation is recorded up to once every 100 &micro;s, making it
possible to store up to a maximum of 10,000 triggers per second.
Triggers from each station are combined with data from the other
stations at a central site, where differential time-of-arrival
techniques are used to generate solutions for the locations of the
source events, in both space and time. A typical lightning
discharge may consist of several hundred to a few thousand located
sources. The observations made by the system are found to reflect
the basic charge structure of electrified storms, as well as
provide invaluable information on the overall storm
morphology.</p><p>Figure 1 demonstrates observations of a horizontally
extensive lightning discharge from a storm over central Oklahoma on
the evening of June 10, 1998. The discharge occurred over the
southern edge of the measurement network and had an overall extent
of 75km. The flash began as an intracloud discharge between the
main negative and upper positive charge layers of the storm.
Subsequent breakdown in the negative charge level continued the
discharge to the north, where it produced a negative-polarity
stroke to ground. This discharge, which lasted approximately 2.5
seconds, produced more than 2400 located radiation events and
demonstrates the LMA's ability to determine discharge structure at
the individual flash level. The different panels show plan view,
east-west and north-south vertical projections and height-time
plots of the lightning activity. The color scale in this example
represents the progression of time, blue being early in the flash
and red being late (linear scale). The small boxes on the plan view
detail the locations of the measurement stations.</p><p>

</p><p>Figure 2 demonstrates the LMA's ability to view storms on
much larger scales. This example is an integration of five minutes
of data, where the color scale now represents event density, red
being the highest activity and purple the lowest (logarithmic
scale). Data of this type helps to determine the location of the
main conective cells in storm systems, as well as determine the
overall size and structure of the storm.</p><p>

best demonstrate the flow of data and Linux's involvement with it,
we trace the stream from its source. An impulsive VHF event occurs,
and the radiation from it arrives at a given remote station.
Operating in each station is an inexpensive PC running Linux. Each
PC has a custom-built digitizer card (built and designed here at NM
Tech) which interfaces with the PC over the ISA bus. The arrival
time and power of each event is recorded and stored into a 16-bit,
32KB-deep FIFO. The digitizer board sets a flag (or generates an
interrupt) noting when the FIFO becomes half-full.</p><p>On the Linux side, there is a device driver (written in C)
running, which polls for the half-full flag or can be set to
utilize interrupts (they happen only a few times a second, so
polling works quite well). When a half-full flag is detected, the
driver initiates a block transfer from the FIFO to the system,
where the data is then flushed to disk.</p><p>The digitizer board itself, which utilizes a microcontroller
in conjunction with a programmable logic device (PLD) to maintain
phase-lock with the GPS receiver (good to about 50-100
nanoseconds), must be configured using a passive-serial mode. This
is accomplished by interfacing through the parallel port on the PC
and clocking in the configuration data (one bit at a time) needed
to program the PLD interface. A few calls to
<span   class="bold"><b>ioperm</b></span> make this an easy task, and
the availability of excellent Linux documentation helped greatly
along the way.</p><p>The collection process goes on all the time, so data starts
to build up on the remote stations. The data files are stored as
fixed-length files, 10MB each. Once a file reaches 10MB, Perl
scripting takes charge. The scripts perform a variety of actions.
First, they take a completed file and write it to the local DAT
tape drive. Currently the stations use DDS-II drives, so each tape
can hold about 4GB of uncompressed data, which amounts to about a
week's worth of data (depending on storm activity). After a
successful write to tape, the file is moved to a backup location on
the local disk as a redundancy method. The scripting monitors the
tape writes, logs them and monitors hard-drive space. If drive
space becomes limited, the oldest files successfully written to
tape are removed. Data tapes are collected on a routine basis via
the famed &ldquo;sneaker net&rdquo; and brought back to a central location
for postprocessing.</p><p>It would be nearly impossible (although we have done it) to
do this all blind. We take advantage of the ease of networking in
Linux to achieve real-time control over the stations. Each remote
station connects back to a central site via wireless radio modems
operating at 115,200bps. The remote stations establish a PPP link
between themselves and the main site; the PPP links are maintained
quite easily with use of more Perl scripts. Having all of the
stations networked to a central site, one which has Internet
access, is a real benefit. This allows for control over the
stations from virtually anywhere. All one has to do is get to the
central site, and access to the remote stations is only an
<span   class="bold"><b>slogin</b></span> away. Real-time control is
invaluable; there are many things which need to be monitored and
adjusted at each station, such as the triggering threshold of the
digitizer, monitoring signal strength, checking battery backup
status and controlling the GPS receiver.</p><p>Once the data have been collected at the central processing
location, the real work begins. The data must be extracted from
tape and combined for each station with corresponding time
intervals. A workhorse machine is needed. We currently use a
dual-processor Linux box running SMP. After combining the data,
various forms of filtering must be done before the solutions can be
obtained. A variety of languages and services help with the task:
filters written in C, Perl and shell scripts for keeping track of
vitals, more C to invert the data, IDL to display the data, HTTP
and FTP servers to collaborate with others and so on.</p><p>In the works is a transition to full real-time processing,
which is well underway. We hope to eliminate the sneaker net and
bring all data back real time, process it and archive it all in one
place. This will reduce the number of man hours considerably, as
well as make the system a more effective tool in collaborative
field campaigns.</p><p>Linux has proven to be an important part of every aspect of
this project. The ease of development on this platform is
unparalleled, as is its flexibility of application. The prodigious
documentation, as well as the massive proliferation of freely
distributed software, has made it our OS of choice. We could not do
what we do without it! It should also be mentioned that the PCs in
the remote stations are up constantly&mdash;the last /proc/uptime
reports over 300 days since the last reboot. Show me a Windows box
that can run for nearly a year, network constantly, and archive
over 100GB of data without so much as a hiccup!</p><p><a href="3973s1.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
