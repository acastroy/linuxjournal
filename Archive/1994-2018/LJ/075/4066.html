      To learn more about building dynamic web sites, Mr. Lerner presents an application for reading the news using Mason and MySQL.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x128b580.0x13834a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we took an initial look at
Mason, a template system that sits on top of
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> and allows us to create
fast-executing dynamic web sites built out of small components.
</p><p>This month, we will look at a simple application built in
Mason&mdash;a system to display the latest press releases on a corporate
site. Of course, such a system could be tailored in a number of
ways, including an on-line newspaper or other publication in which
information changes on a regular basis. In creating this small
site, we will see some of the steps involved in working with
Mason.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x128b580.0x1383660"></a>Creating the Database</h2></div></div><p>The core element of our news system will be a relational
database. I will use MySQL in these examples, although any
relational database system should work fine.</p><p>I created a new MySQL database called &ldquo;atfnews&rdquo; on my MySQL
server and assigned privileges so that the user atfnews can connect
using the password &ldquo;atfpass&rdquo;. I then created the following two
tables:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Categories (
     category_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
     category_name VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
     PRIMARY KEY(category_id),
     UNIQUE(category_name)
);
CREATE TABLE Articles (
     article_id MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT,
     category_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
     posting_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
     headline VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
     body TEXT NOT NULL,
     PRIMARY KEY(article_id),
     UNIQUE(category_id, headline)
);
</pre><p>As you can probably tell from their names, the Categories
table contains a list of category ID numbers and names. The
Articles table contains several more pieces of information,
including an article ID, the category ID into which an article
should be placed, the date and time at which the article was
posted, the article's headline and its body. We ensure no two
articles in a given category have the same headline with a UNIQUE
clause at the end of our CREATE TABLE statement.
</p><p>The posting_date column takes advantage of MySQL's
<b  >TIMESTAMP</b> data type. This type automatically
inserts the time and date of the latest
<span   class="bold"><b>INSERT</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>UPDATE</b></span> to a given row. In this
way, we can easily determine when news stories were added to the
database, without having to enter or keep track of the information
ourselves.</p><p>In order for our news system to work, we will need to create
at least two different sets of components. One set will allow users
to enter news items into the database (i.e., perform INSERTs), and
the second will make it possible to retrieve items from the
database (i.e., perform SELECTs). In a production setting, we would
probably want to restrict posting access to a selected number of
users. This would be possible with a standard .htaccess file, which
allows users to restrict access to individual files or directories,
or with a more sophisticated system that stores user information in
a database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x128b580.0x1383a28"></a>Structuring the Components</h2></div></div><p>One of Mason's strong points is its use of components.
Components are actually Perl subroutines, cleverly disguised in the
form of HTML files with some Perl thrown in. (Mason's parser
performs the underlying magic that turns components into
subroutines.) This structure means that repeated functionality can
be packaged into one component, then invoked from within other
components.</p><p><a href="4066l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>For example, Listing 1 contains a component called
&ldquo;database-connect.comp&rdquo;. This component returns a value, rather
than producing HTML output. Its purpose is to connect to a database
server and return a database handle, typically called
<b  >$dbh</b>. By centralizing this connection code, we
can easily move our site from one server to another, changing only
the relevant <b  >$host</b>, <b  >$user</b>,
<b  >$password</b> and <b  >$database</b>
variables as necessary.</p><p>Once database-connect.comp has been configured, any component
on our system can receive a valid database handle with the
following code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;%init&gt;
my $dbh = $m-&gt;comp(database-connect.comp);
&lt;/%init&gt;
</pre><p>The above code takes advantage of Mason's object-oriented
interface, using the predefined <b  >$m</b> object to
invoke another component.
</p><p>By placing the assignment inside of
<b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b>, we ensure that the component will
connect to the database before anything else occurs within the
component. However, this also means we are creating a new lexical
variable (<b  >$dbh</b>) with each invocation of the
component.</p><p>It would be slightly more elegant to perform the above
assignment within a <b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b> section,
creating <b  >$dbh</b> a single time and keeping the
value around. However, <b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b> sections
are executed outside of the Mason component context, meaning they
cannot invoke methods on <b  >$m</b>. Moreover,
<b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b> sections are invoked before new
Apache child processes are created, which a <b  >$dbh</b>
object might not like. Thus, it is common to define
<b  >$dbh</b> in a <b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b>
section, but to perform the assignment in
<b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;%once&gt;
my $dbh;
&lt;/%once&gt;
&lt;%init&gt;
$dbh = $m-&gt;comp(database-connect.comp);
&lt;/%init&gt;
</pre><p>The plain-vanilla mason.pl (or &ldquo;handler.pl&rdquo;, as the Mason
documentation describes it) configuration file that comes with the
Mason distribution is almost good enough for this system to work.
We need to load only <span   class="bold"><b>Apache::DBI</b></span>,
a wrapper module that works with DBI within the mod_perl
environment, ensuring that database connections are created and
dropped only as necessary.
</p><p>In order to load Apache::DBI, we need to put a
<b  >use&nbsp;Apache::DBI</b> statement in mason.pl,
which is loaded with a <b  >PerlRequire</b> statement in
httpd.conf. In order to save some memory, we insert a
<b  >PerlModule&nbsp;Apache::DBI</b> line into
httpd.conf. This ensures the module is loaded into memory before
Apache splits into numerous child processes. The module might still
require a fair amount of memory, but at least that memory will be
shared among all Apache processes rather than requiring each one to
have its own copy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x128b580.0x1384630"></a>Adding Categories</h2></div></div><p>The first step toward making our news system work is to allow
users to create new categories. Each news story in our simple
system will be placed in precisely one category, much as each story
in a newspaper is printed in only one section.</p><p>If we were to use the CGI model for creating a database
editor, we would need to create an HTML form, pointing its
<b  >&lt;Form&gt;</b> action to the URL of a CGI program.
That CGI program would then need to retrieve the HTML form
elements, connect to the database and perform an INSERT.</p><p><a href="4066l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>With Mason, all this becomes much easier because of the
relationship between HTML form elements and variables. We will
still need two different components, one that presents the form and
another that acts on the form's contents. The first component,
add-category-form.html (see Listing 2), is a normal HTML form, with
a single text field and a &ldquo;submit&rdquo; button. The only difference
between this form and its non-Mason counterpart is the
<b  >action</b> attribute in the
<b  >&lt;Form&gt;</b> tag. In Mason, even a file with an
.html suffix is a program and can thus receive input from an HTML
form.</p><p><a href="4066l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>The component that handles the input and inserts a new row
into the Categories table is called add-category.html (see Listing
3). As is often the case with Mason components, you must first look
at the component's final sections
(<b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b>, <b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b>
and <b  >&lt;%args&gt;</b>) in order to understand what
is happening.</p><p>In the case of add-category.html, our
<b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b> section merely defines
<b  >$dbh</b>, as described above. The
<b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b> section performs two actions.
First, it defines <b  >$dbh</b> based on the returned
value from &ldquo;database-connect.comp&rdquo;. Once the database connection
has been established, the <b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b> section
goes on to INSERT the user's input into the database. Notice how we
use DBI's placeholders, shown here as a question mark in the list
of <b  >VALUES</b>, to avoid potential problems with
quoted strings within our SQL query.</p><p>The placeholder is filled in with the value of
<b  >$new_category_name</b>, a scalar variable defined in
<b  >&lt;%args&gt;</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;%args&gt;
$new_category_name
&lt;/%args&gt;
</pre><p>By defining it there, we indicate that add-category.html must
receive an HTML form element <b  >new_category_name</b>
when it is invoked. We could have given
<b  >new_category_name</b> a default value; however, this
value is crucial to the functioning of add-category.html and must
be mandatory.
</p><p>Depending on whether the SQL INSERT succeeds, the scalar
variable <b  >$successful_insert</b> is set to true or
false. This value is then used in the large if-else statement, to
produce HTML that reflects the success or failure of the INSERT
shown at the beginning of Listing 3. Notice how
<b  >$DBI::errstr</b>, the standard DBI error message, is
available from within our component.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x128b580.0x137ba18"></a>Adding News</h2></div></div><p><a href="4066l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>Once we have added one or more categories, we can begin to
insert news items into the system. Unlike add-category-form.html,
add-news-form.html (Listing 4) will need to connect to the database
and cannot be a simple HTML form. This is because we want to
present the user with a <b  >&lt;select&gt;</b> list of
current categories. In order to create this list dynamically, we
will need to connect to the database and perform a simple SELECT.
Other than that, the HTML form is relatively straightforward. We
will use a table to organize the titles and form elements, but it
consists of three basic elements: a headline, the body text and a
category <b  >&lt;select&gt;</b> list.</p><p>I decided to do this in a relatively inefficient (but easy to
understand) way, using an SQL <b  >ORDER BY</b> clause to
retrieve names in alphabetical order. In order to keep track of the
two different values (ID and name), I put them into the
<b  >@categories</b> array:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
while ($row_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref)
{
     my ($id, $name) = @$row_ref;
     push @categories, {id =&gt; $id,
                         name =&gt; $name};
}
</pre><p>We can then iterate through <b  >@categories</b>,
placing the category ID as the &ldquo;value&rdquo; attribute (which will be
submitted to the add-news.html component), but displaying the name
of the category:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;select name="category_id"&gt;
% foreach my $category (@categories) {
&lt;option value="&lt;% $category-&gt;{id} %&gt;"&gt;
&lt;% $category-&gt;{name} %&gt;
% }
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre>


<a href="4066l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a>
</p><p>The component that adds news, add-news.html (Listing 5), is
almost identical to add-category.html, except it inserts three
values rather than just one: the category ID, the headline and the
body of the article. If the submission is successful, we tell the
user that the article has now been placed in the database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x128b580.0x137bf98"></a>Retrieving News</h2></div></div><p>While we could retrieve the news directly into a top-level
component, it is easier for us to create a generic component that
retrieves any number of articles from any category. In this way, we
can use this &ldquo;get-news.comp&rdquo; component in a number of different
high-level components, retrieving the number and type of articles
that interest us.</p><p><a href="4066l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a></p><p>Listing 6, get-news.comp, is fairly straightforward,
returning a list of articles to the caller. It builds the article
list much as we built the category list in add-news-form.html,
retrieving each of the articles:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
while ($row_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref)
{
     my ($headline, $body, $posting_date) =
           @$row_ref;
     push @articles, {headline =&gt; $headline,
           body =&gt; $body,
           posting_date =&gt; $posting_date};
}
return @articles;
</pre><p>We take advantage of MySQL's <b  >LIMIT</b> clause
to restrict the retrieval to only as many articles as the user is
interested in receiving. Also, we retrieve the articles in reverse
order of their arrival, so that the article with the latest
timestamp will come first. This ensures whenever we retrieve the
latest five articles, they will indeed be the newest:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $sql  = "SELECT headline, body, posting_date ";
   $sql .= "FROM Articles ";
   $sql .= "WHERE category_id = ?";
   $sql .= "ORDER BY posting_date DESC ";
   $sql .= "LIMIT ?";
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x128b580.0x137c308"></a>Printing the News</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>get-news.comp</b></span> returns the
latest news into an array. But, of course, users are interested in
reading news, not looking at a Perl array. For that reason, we'll
define two more top-level components: one to choose the category
and number of articles we wish to read and one to display
them.</p><p><a href="4066l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a></p><p>First, we will create a component view-stories-form.html
(Listing 7), which lets us choose a category and maximum number of
stories to display. This component repeats the paradigm of creating
a <b  >&lt;select&gt;</b> list from a Perl array. It then
invokes view-stories.html (Listing 8), a simple component which
does nothing but iterate through the stories returned by
get-news.comp, placing them in a nicely formatted page of
HTML.</p><p><a href="4066l8.html" target="_self">Listing 8</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x128b580.0x137c678"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>As you can see, the amount of effort and code necessary to
create this site was fairly modest. And while this is a relatively
simple site, it does work&mdash;and it represents one way in which Mason
and databases can be used together to create a dynamic site in a
minimum amount of time. True, we ended up writing a number of
components; but at least two of them are reusable if we decide to
expand the site in the future, and thus will reduce the amount of
work and debugging we'll have to do at that time.</p><p>With a bit more work, we could add personalization to this
site, allowing users to read only news that is new to them and in
only the categories that interest them.</p><p>As I indicated last month, Mason has increasingly become my
tool of choice for producing these sorts of web sites, because of
the speed and ease with which I can do so. The fact that I can
separate tasks into reusable components and the high-speed gains
from working within mod_perl are bonuses that make Mason an
extremely attractive web-development environment.</p><p><a href="4066s1.html" target="_self">4066s1</a></p></div></div>
