time, I have used Vim for text editing. I had tried Emacs a few
times, but found it difficult to learn. I decided to try learning
Emacs again with help from SAMS' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Teach Yourself Emacs in
24 Hours</em></span>.</p><p>While I can say I learned enough from the book to use Emacs
(I'm using it to write this review), I would hesitate to recommend
this book to anyone else. The biggest problem I found was the sheer
number of typos it contained. In addition to that, the accompanying
CD-ROM is not well-organized, either.</p><p>Let me quickly say that the authors seem to know Emacs well,
and they have done a good job of selecting the features to present
to new users. The examples they give are generally clear and
illuminating. They also highlight the differences between Emacs and
XEmacs in the examples, so the book is useful no matter which
version of Emacs you are using.</p><p>If you do purchase this book, the first thing you should do
is go to Mr. Pedersen's web site at
<a href="http://www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/emacs" target="_self">www.imada.ou.dk/~blackie/emacs</a> and
print out the book's errata pages. Unfortunately, even
with these, I still couldn't get some of the book's examples to
work, such as running the etags command on HTML files.</p><p>In addition to the printed errors, I also ran into problems
with the accompanying CD. The first was that I couldn't access it
on my Linux box unless I was logged in as root. Doing work as root
is not a good idea in general, and in some instances, at work for
example, it may not even be possible. When I did access the CD, I
found that its directory structure left something to be
desired.</p><p>The CD's root directory contains only two entries: opt and
usr. The opt directory contains the Windows and Linux versions of
Emacs, while the usr directory contains Emacs Lisp files and
add-ons. This layout is a bit confusing, and there are no index or
README files to indicate what is where.</p><p>For Windows users who don't already have Emacs loaded, the
second chapter covers installing and configuring Emacs under
Windows. I found the book's suggested directory layout confusing,
so I didn't attempt to create it on my Windows 98 system. Instead,
I just created an .emacs file in the root directory of my C:
drive.</p><p>The book implies that the CD will automatically start
installing Emacs when inserted in a Windows machine, but it doesn't
appear to be set up for this. I ended up installing Emacs using the
SETUP.EXE program, and it ran correctly after installation. The CD
also contains Zip files if you want to install Emacs
manually.</p><p>Though the installation instructions are somewhat unclear,
the book did provide clear instructions on setting up printing and
associating files with Emacs under Windows.</p><p>The rest of the book is well-arranged, starting with the
basics of Emacs and leading up to its advanced features. I found
that each chapter presented enough information to increase a new
user's knowledge without drowning them. Examples are given for
almost every topic brought up. Each chapter ends with a summary of
the material presented followed by a short Q&amp;A section.
Finally, a few exercises are given for readers to attempt on their
own.</p><p>The early chapters cover basic editing, working with buffers
and searching. An explanation of the Emacs help and configuration
system is in the middle of the book. Next, the special editing
modes for C, Java and LaTeX files are discussed. There is a chapter
covering the use of Emacs' version-control functions, along with
compiling and debugging programs. There are two chapters on Gnus (a
news and mail reader that runs under Emacs). Beginning Emacs Lisp,
an introduction to key bindings, and how to use add-ons comprise
the final chapters of the book.</p><p>The book makes several references to add-ons included on the
CD, especially the sams-lib.el file which contains a number of
specialty functions created by the authors. Some attempt is made to
provide brief descriptions and installation instructions for the
add-ons, but only a few from the CD are actually covered in the
book.</p><p>I am amazed at just how powerful Emacs is, and this book does
a good job of introducing a new user to the sheer number of
features available in it. The authors also did a very good job of
choosing the right amount of material to allow someone to use Emacs
without overloading them. I wish they had spent a little more time
on such things as regular expressions and the Windows installation
directions, though.</p><p>Unfortunately, the large number of errors contained in the
text along with the confusing layout of the accompanying CD almost
keep this book from being usable by its target audience: beginners.
I would expect that the next release will have corrected these
problems, and then it will be an invaluable addition to the
beginning Emacs user's bookshelf.</p></div></div>
