is essential for scientific enterprise and sustainable development.
For several decades, the Abdus Salam International Centre for
Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy, has paid special
attention to the needs of developing countries to foster, through
training and research, the progress of science.
</p><p>The Centre long ago realized the importance of information
retrieval systems on the Internet, including the distribution of
in-house preprints, yearly activities and public access
catalogs.</p><p>On a technical level, Linux provides us with a cost-effective
alternative for promoting distance electronic collaboration (see
Resources). Based on the Linux OS, virtual laboratories and the
extensive use of digital communication tools can help reduce
scientific isolation, while filling the need to transfer knowledge
to developing countries in the Southern Hemisphere in an
unprecedented way (see Resources).</p><p>Following these principles, we have started building
prototype, on-line scientific tools to further enhance electronic
collaboration and to support the use of web navigation and database
search by e-mail. Below, we describe two tools that Salam ICTP
offers the low-bandwidth scientific community. Both packages use
state-of-the-art technologies and software developed in-house, and
are distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1725580.0x181d7c0"></a>www4mail&mdash;Web Navigation and Database Search by
E-Mail</h2></div></div><p>The ICTP <span   class="bold"><b>www4mail</b></span> software
allows navigation and search of the entire Internet via e-mail,
using any standard web browser and a MIME (Multipurpose Internet
Mail Exchange)-aware e-mail program. At first glance, it may appear
similar to one of the several web-to-mail software interfaces; but
the www4mail program introduces new features not previously
available. In short, e-mail messages containing filtered HTML pages
are automatically passed to the www4mail server when links to other
web sites are selected while browsing.</p><p>Written in modular Perl, the program allows retrieval of web
pages, searching of arbitrary databases, filling out of web forms
(GET and POST conduct web database searches) and following of links
(on-line browsing), all by e-mail. It is multi-lingual, easy to
manage and supports current Internet standards (MIME, HTML 4.0,
etc.).</p><p>Developed from scratch on the Linux platform,
<span   class="bold"><b>www4mail</b></span> has been used
successfully on the BSD platform and contains some optional
optimisations that are Linux-specific. For example, www4mail can
monitor the system load average, directly from the Linux /proc file
system and, at high load averages, queue requests for later
processing.</p><p>Here are some major features of www4mail:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>sends replies as e-mail attachments or in the body
of an e-mail message, depending on the type of request options sent
by the e-mail client through the web browser</p></li><li><p>supports scripting, once the browser can display
it</p></li><li><p>delivers most types of web documents, including
JavaScript and cookies</p></li><li><p>handles dynamic contents, parsing text HTML and
source HTML</p></li><li><p>preserves the original layout of requested web
pages</p></li><li><p>retrieves information from FTP sites and Usenet
news servers</p></li><li><p>handles meta tags; that is, if a web page is
redirected or relocated by the use of a meta statement, www4mail
automatically warns about the possible relocation of the
information and provides suitable links for the new location at the
top of the reply page</p></li><li><p>handles frames, inserting suitable links to each
framed document</p></li><li><p>supports user authentication for password-protected
web/FTP sites</p></li><li><p>traps error messages and sends them back to the
user</p></li><li><p>provides support for text-only access for
compatibility with the alternative &ldquo;Agora&rdquo; and &ldquo;GetWeb&rdquo;
web-mail servers</p></li><li><p>serves filtered requests to reduce bandwidth</p></li><li><p>supports the transfer of binary data</p></li><li><p>allows web pages to be downloaded as PostScript
files, to be viewed or printed locally (see

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3825f1.jpg"></div>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>www4mail</b></span> (see logo in Figure
1) was developed mainly to help researchers from developing
countries browse the Web using only e-mail and slow Internet links.
While the amount of information on the Web has grown exponentially
in the last few years, there is still a large community of Internet
users who have access to only e-mail, or their Internet providers
do not offer full Internet connections (some of them still use
UUCP) or who cannof afford to have an expensive account with full
Internet capabilities. Many of these users live in rural areas of
developing countries, and rely on e-mail to access essential
medical and business information as well as for interpersonal
communication and world news. Having the ability to query available
databases (such as AltaVista, HotBot, etc.) or preprint
repositories with one simple e-mail and receive the output in a few
minutes (or hours) could help them tremendously with their
scientific work.</p><p>At present, www4mail can be tested by sending an e-mail
message to www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it, or to any other place where
the gateway is installed (e.g., Bellanet-Canada,
<a href="http://www.bellanet.org/email.htm" target="_self">www.bellanet.org/email.htm</a>),
listing the requested URL(s) in the body of the message.</p><p>Over 50 server configuration options are currently available
for setting parameters such as maximum quota per user, gateway
administrators, maximum size of each request, or to split sizes for
large files. (Type <b  >help</b> in the body of the
e-mail message for further details).</p><p>The installation procedure of the server is simple. For
example, under Red Hat Linux, create a user account called www4mail
(<b  >adduser&nbsp;www4mail</b>), log on as user www4mail
(<b  >su&nbsp;-&nbsp;www4mail</b>), extract the tar
archive in the home directory for www4mail
(<b  >tar&nbsp;zxvf www4mail.tar.gz</b>)
and perform a few extra operations
(e.g., to enable forwarding). It is necessary to create a link from
the executable /home/www4mail/bin/www4mail to the /etc/smrsh
subdirectory in order to keep the sendmail MTA (mail transfer
agent) happy. To optimize its configuration, some preliminary
monitoring is necessary.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>www4mail</b></span> has been very
useful for many people from many different countries, often
receiving over 12,000 requests per day. You can view weekly
statistics at

Discussions via Web</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3825f2.jpg"></div>
</p><p>ScientificTalk (see logo in Figure 2) is a
profession-specific prototype tool for scientists, students and
teachers to exchange information via a web browser, using a display
of math equations in a synchronous manner. The project focus is on
users' interests in such things as mathematics and scientific
notation. Our motivation follows an early goal for the Web to be a
readable and writable collaborative medium.</p><p>Unfortunately, the large tag repertoire of the HTML 4.0
language does not cater to mathematics, since they cannot mark up
complex mathematical expressions. Usually, to create technical
documents with mathematical or scientific content, web authors
resort to methods involving images (e.g., screen captures of
equations), which means the sharing of scholastic and scientific
material by lecturers, students, etc. is often a many-step process.
There are a few available applets and plug-ins that can render
MathML in a browser (which are not necessarily designed for
synchronous collaboration).</p><p>The Mathematical Markup Language, MathML, is a recommendation
of the W3C, which provides a foundation for including mathematical
expressions in web pages. As an application of the Extensible
Markup Language (XML) and with adequate style-sheet support, MathML
will ultimately make it possible for browsers to natively render
math expressions, including threaded on-line discussions. (Some
applets and plug-ins are currently available, which can render
MathML in a browser.) See W3C at
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Math" target="_self">http://www.w3.org/Math/</a>
for a complete list of technical/scientific document viewers and
renderers such as the Scientific MessageBoard WebEQ, the IBM
techexplorer, EzMath editor and LaTex2HTML.</p><p>ScientificTalk is a Perl script for a standard multiway
graphical web chat. This CGI-based application is portable across
platforms and allows the viewing of occupants, sending input to
specific users, etc. While chatting on-line, it converts textual
input or standard LaTeX&mdash;a popular computer language for composing
formatted scientific text for high-quality printing&mdash;into HTML. The
math displayed on the browser is rich because of the LaTeX
typesetting and Ian Hutchinson's powerful TeX-to-HTML translator,
<span   class="bold"><b>tth</b></span>, available at
<a href="http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth" target="_self">http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/</a>.</p><p>For those not familiar with LaTeX commands, ScientificTalk
has an external symbols keyboard as well as a composer and
messenger window for the user input. There is no need for extra
plug-ins or high-speed networks&mdash;all input is passed via text-mode
only. On the client side, Netscape (v4.0 or greater) needs a simple
character-set configuration (for details and demo, connect to
<a href="http://sv7.ictp.trieste.it" target="_self">http://sv7.ictp.trieste.it/</a>.</p><p>Although the ScientificTalk prototype has proven that it is
possible to carry out synchronous math discussions on the Web
between distant clients today, our to-do list is still long. For
example, it would be useful to save a complete session as a LaTeX
file (in order to restart an on-line discussion from a given
session or collaboratively write LaTeX documents on the Web),
display plots from a given function, create small transparent .gif
files, and extend its language capabilities to symbols in other
domains, such as chemistry.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1725580.0x1815910"></a>Concluding Remarks</h2></div></div><p>More opportunities for learning and growth are available if
we can shar ideas via a computer environment that is responsive to
our professional needs. For example, using simplified scientific
notation on the Web can lead to faster, more effective results.
Electronic tools, designed for collaboration and based on Linux,
will continue to play an important role in an increasingly
interconnected world. Off-line browsing via web-to-e-mail servers
such as www4mail is still a reality from remote areas of the world,
and most likely will remain so, as the number of Internet users is
expected to double to 300 million by the year 2005.</p><p><a href="3825s1.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p><p><a href="3825s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
