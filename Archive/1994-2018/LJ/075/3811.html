patches, with Tripwire running every night, with log analyzer
connected to another computer using a serial line which will call
you by phone when something suspicious occurs&mdash;sounds good? Now
imagine a new bug in Sendmail or
<span   class="bold"><b>ftpd</b></span>, hundreds of relatively
unknown users using many better- or worse-written setuid programs.
Hmmm. Can you sleep well? You can say, &ldquo;I have monitoring scripts,
so I'll be informed by phone when somebody gains root access.&rdquo; But
you could just cry when some stupid vandal immediately executes
<b  >rm -fr /</b>. It's too late, especially if you are
away and cannot sit in front of your computer and have a look at
what happened. Or you can say, &ldquo;I'm making a regular backup of my
system, so I'll restore it.&rdquo;
</p><p>Making backups is a laudable activity, but will you restore
every week, when every week somebody finds a new bug before you can
fix it? Well, it seems you have to disconnect your computer from
the Internet, shut it down and pray your data will be safe. No,
don't panic! I have something for you. Its name is Medusa DS9. It's
not a panacea, it's not perfect, but it is a very interesting piece
of software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2278580.0x2370b30"></a>What is Medusa DS9 and How Does it Work?</h2></div></div><p>In the Slovak language, &ldquo;medusa&rdquo; means &ldquo;jellyfish&rdquo;. Like
jellyfish, Medusa can sting an enemy with its tentacles. In Greek
mythology, Medusa was one of the three Gorgon monsters. Anybody who
got a glimpse of her face became petrified. Medusa is a security
system which can extend the overall security of your Linux system.
Medusa consists of two parts. The first is a set of small patches
to the Linux kernel, and the second is a user-space security
d&aelig;mon (authorization server) called Constable.</p><p>You may ask, &ldquo;Why do I need a security system such as
Medusa?&rdquo; The answer depends on many factors. If you have a machine
at home, you'll probably not need it. If you have a well-known and
frequently used Internet server, you may have use for it. Why?
Because the UNIX security scheme seems to be insufficient nowadays.
Yes, it's really simple (like the whole UNIX principle), but it has
many limitations. Just to mention two of them: you have no system
rights at all as an ordinary user, and all rights to the whole
system as root. So, when somebody breaks in using any network
d&aelig;mon, he can do anything he likes inside, e.g., graphics
subsystem or low-level disk operations.</p><p>Another problem connected with this is that any program which
wants to use a socket with a number less than 1024 must have root
privileges. In those ancient days of 4.1aBSD systems, this seemed
to be a good idea; now, when combined with the limitations of BSD
TCP/IP stack and buffer overflow problems, our computers are living
in hard times. While Medusa cannot change those things, it tries to
eliminate their impact.</p><p>The basic idea behind Medusa is really simple. Before
execution of certain operations, the kernel asks the authorization
server (Constable) for confirmation. The authorization server then
permits, forbids or changes the operation. The authorization server
and kernel talk to each other through the special device:
/dev/medusa. In this way, an administrator can create his own
security model, which can complete or override the original UNIX
model. I have told you the principle is simple; however, the actual
implementation is a bit complicated. If you are interested in how,
see Resources.</p><p>In 1995, the authors of Medusa were administrators of
university machines. Since there were many users, someone often
cracked a machine and used it as a base for nasty activities.
Instead of taking part in a never-ending race with crackers and
their exploits, they decided to achieve better security in a
different way. In 1996, an ancient preliminary version, old Medusa,
was born. After more development, a new generation called Medusa
DS9 appeared in July 1998.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2278580.0x2370d98"></a>Some Usage Examples</h2></div></div><p>Constable is driven by its configuration file, which is
usually /usr/local/etc/constable.conf. Here you can specify all the
security settings you need. This configuration file can be
considered a simple program. It has functions, conditions, events,
blocks, etc., and is very similar to C. Constable is event-driven.
When any event (syscall, VFS operation, signal) occurs, an
appropriate action is executed. In the first example, we will
protect one file against deletion. The Constable configuration is
in Listing 1. Now, when someone tries to delete this file, Medusa
returns the messages shown at the bottom of Listing 1. Hmmm; it
seems as though the /tmp/delme file is undeletable, even by
root.</p><p><a href="3811l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Of course, it's not too useful to have one undeletable file.
So, have a look at Listing 2, in which we will set a booby trap for
every non-root user who tries to run the
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> program. This
configuration is still not too useful, but does show how you can
redirect execution of any program to something else. Thus, you can
protect some sensitive programs against execution by some users.
You can also redirect any file operation (access, unlink, read) to
another file. For example, users who are coming to one machine from
the network can have a different passwd and shadow file than local
users.</p><p><a href="3811l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>In order to make Medusa really usable, we have to go deeper
inside its functionality and configuration. Medusa uses the concept
of virtual spaces. That means you can assign any process or file
(inode) to one or more virtual spaces. Processes in one virtual
space cannot see, change or influence processes or files in another
virtual space. So, you can quite easily separate a few critical
parts of your system from other parts. For example, you can have
your Sendmail and FTP d&aelig;mons in virtual space number one and
other system-critical files (such as the /etc directory, kernel and
user home directories) in virtual space number two. Even if
somebody exploits the FTP d&aelig;mon, he can do nothing, other
than look at <span   class="bold"><b>ftpd</b></span> configuration
files and the content of your public FTP directory if Medusa is
properly configured.</p><p>In Listing 3, we will create two virtual spaces, one for the
whole file system and another for the /tmp directory. Then we will
protect the file /tmp/delme against deletion. When somebody tries
to delete this file, he will be &ldquo;fired&rdquo; from the /tmp virtual
space and will not be able to access any file in the /tmp directory
or its subdirectories (even if they are mounted from another disk).
This example can easily be modified to disallow this user from
seeing the entire file system (by setting <b  >vss</b> to
0). Keyword <b  >vss</b> changes the virtual space a
process can see. Virtual-space variables are usually modified by
numbers in binary format (0b) which sets individual bits of those
variables (10 binary is 2 in decimal). As you can see from the
listing, you can make comments as in C programming using // or /*
*/ characters.</p><p><a href="3811l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>Except for virtual spaces, information on operations, which
have to be confirmed by the security d&aelig;mon, can be stored for
each process and file. Actions for a file can be access, creation
or deletion; for a process, they can be fork, exec, signals and so
on. For operations you don't care about, the control system works
the same as without Medusa installed. For operations you want to
control (such as unlink in the first example), the system asks the
security d&aelig;mon. Now we will monitor and control execution of
suid programs, as shown in Listing 4. We will disallow execution of
suid programs (like <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span>) for users who connect using
the TELNET protocol. It can be easily modified to control
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> connections too, so a locally
logged-in user can su to root, for example.</p><p><a href="3811l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>You can now ask, &ldquo;What if somebody does write and compile
his own TELNET d&aelig;mon?&rdquo; The answer is, of course, that this
configuration of Constable will allow him to run suid programs. To
be 100% sure, you can monitor system calls. It can be done by
keyword to <span   class="bold"><b>syscall</b></span>. In the
variable <b  ><i><tt>action</tt></i></b>,
there is a syscall number stored (102 is socketcall), and in
variables <b  >trace1</b> to <b  >trace5</b>
there are parameters specified for this syscall. This configuration
(see Listing 5) monitors every process that starts to use a network
because the socketcall, <b  >syscall 102</b>, must be
used to do it, either with incoming or outgoing connections. The
<b  >lpeek</b> keyword reads data from the given address
(<b  >trace2</b>, the second socketcall parameter) and
stores it into the variable <span   class="emphasis"><em>$x</em></span>. This example
also shows the usage of user-defined variables. When a network
connection is used, a function named
<span   class="bold"><b>doit</b></span> will be called. If another
syscall is called, the trace for this syscall is switched off. By
default, the trace is switched on for all syscalls. To switch it
off, you can use the <b  >trace_off</b> keyword.</p><p><a href="3811l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p><p>We are now coming to the most advanced feature of Medusa. You
can force execution of any code in the context of any program. To
simplify that process, there is a special library called Mlibc
developed and included with Medusa. Mlibc (which stands for Medusa
or Mini libc) is a small library, providing declaration of many
standard functions, structures, macros and constants. When you link
your &ldquo;force&rdquo; code with Mlibc, you'll get a program which can be
executed inside a controlled process, as if it were compiled as an
integral part of it. In Listings 6 and 7, we forced execution of
the <span   class="bold"><b>exit</b></span> function when any program
tried to delete our well-known /tmp/delme file. The principle is
simple; first, we will compile the &ldquo;force&rdquo; code
(<span   class="bold"><b>exitme.c</b></span>) using</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -O2 -c -o exitme.o exitme.c
</pre><p>Then we will link it with Mlibc:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ld -r -o exitme exitme.o mlibc.o
</pre>


After that, we will force execution of this code in the Constable
configuration file in the event of unlinking of the /tmp/delme
file.
</p><p><a href="3811l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a></p><p><a href="3811l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a></p><p>Remember, <span   class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> use these to create your
own impregnable Linux castle. They are truly just examples.</p><p>Among other nice features, Medusa knows and supports POSIX
capabilities, so you can monitor and alter capabilities according
to your needs.</p><p><a href="3811s2.html" target="_self">Installation</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2278580.0x276a170"></a>What Next?</h2></div></div><p>The Medusa development team is working heavily on it. They
want to make Medusa a bit more object-oriented. That means you'll
be better able to handle system objects to set their properties.
They want to port it to other platforms (currently, only
Linux/Intel is supported) and create a front end which will allow
the administrator to create and configure security schemes more
easily.</p><p>Medusa was not tested extensively on multiprocessor systems,
but those who tried it didn't report any serious problems. Medusa
needs a bit more detailed and better documentation. Constable
configuration scripts can be truly complicated, so some form of
automatic configurator will probably appear in future versions. You
can write your own front end to Medusa, which can create the needed
security model and implement it by using Constable
configuration.</p><p>Medusa is a very interesting system, not only with security
functionality. It will probably never appear in the official
kernel, but can be used as an add-on package to increase the
security of your Linux system.</p><p><a href="3811s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3811s3.html" target="_self">Good/bad</a></p></div></div>
