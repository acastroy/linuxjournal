    An overview of configuring Linux using Samba to replace the
    services provided from Windows NT servers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19b7580.0x1aaf608"></a></h2></div></div><p>You have probably been hearing many
rumors lately about Linux in the corporate environment. I've been
hearing &ldquo;Linux is great, but it's not ready for production&rdquo; and
&ldquo;I wouldn't trust my business to Linux.&rdquo; Lately, with all the
press Linux has been getting, it's time to set the record straight.
Being a longtime UNIX user, I jumped on the Linux bandwagon several
years ago. I have used Linux in a production environment and know
plenty of people who are doing the same.
</p><p>There are many web, mail and database servers currently used
in production systems, with more being added all the time. Linux
success stories range from Linux being used at NASA, to being used
for creating movie effects. So, is Linux ready for a prime time
production environment? You bet! Is Linux ready to replace Windows
NT Servers for your corporate LANs? Yep! I'll walk you through
building a Linux server that is going to be more stable, faster,
easier to maintain and costs less.</p><p>In setting up a Linux file and print server, you will find
more configuration and customization than I will be using in this
simple scenario. To learn more about the different options and
configurations, see the Resources section at the end of this
article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19b7580.0x1aaf7c0"></a>SMB Background</h2></div></div><p>Windows machines use a protocol called Server Message Block
(SMB) to perform file and print sharing as a network service. The
SMB protocol defines how clients talk to servers to request
printers, files, security validation and more. SMB has been around
for a long time, and has some limitations that require a bit of
thought. SMB requests and responses are based on local broadcasts
for a NetBIOS name, which is usually the server name. This presents
a problem to (routed) environments in which routers separate
networks, like the Internet, because broadcasts do not pass through
routers. This created a need for translation from NetBIOS names to
IP addresses. Microsoft implemented this solution as the Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS).</p><p>SMB is also used for directory services. Most users think of
the directory services as the &ldquo;Network Neighborhood&rdquo; feature on
their desktops. It's a bit more than that, but enough to start.
It's important to keep track of which machines are on a network and
the services they provide. Nodes do this by electing a &ldquo;Browse
Master&rdquo; that keeps track of which computers are on the network.
When SMB machines boot, they broadcast their name and service
information for all to hear. The elected browse master keeps a
database of these names and will respond to requests from local
machines. This browse master can be updated from other browse
masters on different networks and can share its own
information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19b7580.0x1aaf920"></a>Windows NT Services</h2></div></div><p>First, let's take a look at a sample Windows NT network and
see what services are being provided (Figure 1). A Windows NT
server has been configured as a file and print server. Users log in
to the Windows NT server, using their Client for Microsoft Networks
service with their network credentials. Once the user has been
validated, a logon batch file is executed that assigns a user's
home directory, various network drives and printers. The NT server
also keeps track of which computers are on the network and the
services they provide; clients can use this information in the
Network Neighborhood.</p><p>

The Linux Side of the House
</p></div></div>
</p><p>Linux can use SMB to communicate with Windows and DOS-based
clients using a package named Samba. The Samba suite was originally
created by Andrew Tridgell, and is now developed by the Samba team.
The Samba suite is currently running on somewhere around forty
different platforms spanning the globe. Samba's main server
d&aelig;mons are <span   class="bold"><b>smbd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>nmbd</b></span>, which are pronounced
&ldquo;SMB-Dee&rdquo; and &ldquo;NMB-Dee&rdquo;. <span   class="bold"><b>smbd</b></span>
provides file, print and authentication services to Windows and DOS
clients, and nmbd provides NetBIOS name resolution and browsing
services (rfc1001/1002). Using these packages, Linux can easily
provide the same services as our NT scenario.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19b7580.0x1aafd98"></a>Building a SAMBA Server</h2></div></div><p>Get the samba-latest.tar.gz file from the SAMBA site and
unpack it to a temporary directory using</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xvzf samba-latest.tar.gz
</pre><p>Change to this directory, and review the README files for any
special information. After familiarizing yourself with the
documentation, begin the install with the following commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd source
 /configure
make
make install
</pre>


Once the <b  >make install</b> is complete, smbd and nmbd
should be ready for configuration.
</p><p>In reading the Samba documentation, you will find many
different ways to configure smbd and nmbd. The Samba suite has
extensive features that allow Linux to integrate and complement NT
servers and services, but we are going to configure our Linux
server to replace the NT server shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we
are going to configure Samba to validate users and run our login
batch file, provide file and print shares, and provide
network-browsing services.</p><p>Begin by editing the smbd initialization file, smb.conf. By
default, it is located in /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf, but is
sometimes found at /etc/smb.conf. I would like to stress that there
are many features which can be configured in the smb.conf file, and
I am starting with only the basics.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19b7580.0x1ab00b0"></a>Global Parameters</h2></div></div><p><b  >security = user</b> is the default security
setting for Samba 2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>. This configures Samba
to require a user to provide authentication to access the server.
To understand how Samba works with NT domains and servers, see
&ldquo;Security = Domain&rdquo; in the Samba documentation.</p><p><b  >iworkgroup = MyGroup</b> controls which
workgroup your server will appear to be in when queried by
clients.</p><p><b  >encrypt passwords = Yes</b> controls whether
encrypted passwords will be negotiated with the client. Windows NT
4SP3+ and Windows 98 will expect an encrypted password by
default.</p><p><b  >min passwd length = 6</b> sets the minimum
length in characters of a plaintext password that smbd will accept
when performing UNIX password changing.</p><p><b  >smb passwd file = /etc/smbpasswd</b> sets the
path to the encrypted smbpasswd file. By default, the path to the
smbpasswd file is compiled into Samba. I always add this to reduce
confusion.</p><p><b  >logon script = STARTUP.BAT</b> specifies the
batch file (.bat) or NT command file (.cmd) to be downloaded and
run on a machine when a user successfully logs in. The file must
contain the DOS-style cr/lf (carriage return/line feed) line
endings.</p><p>If <b  >domain logons = Yes</b> is set to true, the
Samba server will serve Windows 95/98 domain logons for the
workgroup it is in. For more details on setting up this feature,
see the file DOMAINS.txt in the Samba documentation.</p><p><b  >domain master = Yes</b> enables WAN-wide (wide
area network) browse list collation. Setting this option causes
nmbd to claim a special domain-specific NetBIOS name that
identifies it as a domain master browser for its given workgroup.
Local master browsers in the same workgroup on broadcast-isolated
subnets will give this nmbd their local browse lists, and will then
ask smbd for a complete copy of the browse list for the entire WAN.
Browser clients will then contact their local master browser and
will receive the domain-wide browse list, instead of just the list
for their broadcast-isolated subnet.</p><p><b  >preferred master = Yes</b> is a Boolean
parameter which controls whether nmbd is a preferred master browser
for its workgroup.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19b7580.0x1ab07e8"></a>Setting Up Network Shares</h2></div></div><p>That's it for our global parameters. We can now move on to
creating network shares. By setting up a <b  >[homes]</b>
section, our server can create home-directory mappings on the
fly:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[homes]
comment = Home Directories
read only = No
create mask = 0750
browseable = No
</pre><p>Now let's create some shares for users to access. The share
definition should include the path, who can access the share (valid
or invalid) and whether the share is writeable. By default, if no
valid user or group is defined, the share is open to any client, so
keep this in mind when creating your shares. In the apps share, I
chose to create the UNIX group <b  >all_users</b>
containing just my local users.
<pre     class="programlisting">
[apps]
comment = Apps Directory
path = /shares/apps
valid users = @all_users
read only = No
[project1]
comment = Project 1 Directory
path = /shares/proj1
valid users = dcsmith kholmes joe katie redpup
read only = No
</pre>


Last, I set up my netlogon home. This will be set to the relative
path for my netlogon scripts. In this example, my login script is
located at /etc/netlogon/STARTUP.BAT.
<pre     class="programlisting">
[netlogon]
path = /etc/netlogon
</pre>


The full Samba configuration script is shown in Listing 1.

checking everything out, you will probably want to add this to your
system startup procedures.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/samba/bin/smbd -D -s
/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf
/usr/local/samba/bin/nmbd -D
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19b7580.0x1ea8f60"></a>Troubleshooting</h2></div></div><p>If everything went well, both smbd and nmbd were started
successfully. If not, start troubleshooting by reading the log
files at /var/adm/logs and review the FAQs from the Samba
site.</p><p>Troubleshooting utilities, located in the Samba bin
directory, are <span   class="bold"><b>testparm</b></span>, which
will parse your smb.conf for errors,
<span   class="bold"><b>smbstatus</b></span>, and
<span   class="bold"><b>nmblookup</b></span> for NetBIOS name
issues.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19b7580.0x1ea91c8"></a>Setting Up the Samba Password File</h2></div></div><p>Now it's time to add your users and passwords to your
smbpassword file. One item to note is that users must have a UNIX
account password as well. There are many options regarding
passwords, such as remote password sync and NT domain and
pass-through authentication, to help you with larger administration
issues. In our case, user accounts are on our local Linux box. This
command will create a SMB account and then prompt you to change
your password.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/samba/bin/smbpasswd -a testuser
</pre><p>You should now be able to log in as testuser and get
authenticated from your Windows machines and access network shares.
Great fun, eh? Once you get up and running, you will want to use
some of the tools and utilities that Samba provides. One of the
more useful utilities available is SWAT, a web-based administration
tool that helps monitor and configure almost all Samba
configurations. If SWAT is not available on your system, you can
find it and more on the Samba home page.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19b7580.0x1ea9380"></a>Wrapping it Up</h2></div></div><p>Hopefully, I provided you with enough information and
inspiration to build Linux file and print servers. While I am not
recommending that you dash out and replace your production NT
servers, give Linux servers a chance. I'll bet you'll find them
more stable and reliable, and they make remote administration much
easier. The Samba team is constantly making Samba a better product
with more and better features and utilities. As Linux solutions
become more and more of a reality, I believe you will find that
Linux file and print servers are an efficient, cost-saving
tool&mdash;that will make both you and your department budget
happy.</p><p><a href="3476s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
