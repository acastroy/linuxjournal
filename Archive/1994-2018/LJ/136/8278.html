The Ubuntu Linux distribution is produced by a company called
Canonical, working together with the Debian Project.
Its goal is to make a free Linux distribution that
simply works and is localized for as many different
languages as possible. You can read the Ubuntu
Manifesto on the ubuntulinux.org Web site. The name
Ubuntu is an ancient African word that means &ldquo;humanity
to others&rdquo;.
</p><p>
This is the second release of Ubuntu, code-named
Hoary Hedgehog. The previous release was Ubuntu
4.10. The version numbers are based on the year
and month of the release; 5.04, therefore, was released in April 2005.
</p><p>
Ubuntu 5.04 provides cutting-edge Linux desktop
features and easy administration with Debian's APT
package management system. It also is available in a
live CD version that runs without installing on
the hard drive. Ubuntu is supported on x86, x86_64
and PowerPC architectures, and future plans call for
releases to support additional architectures.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16cb580.0x17c3e48"></a>
Getting Ubuntu</h2></div></div><p>
The usual way to get Ubuntu is to download a CD
image either from the Ubuntu Web site or by using a
BitTorrent client. Alternatively, you can order official
Ubuntu CDs if you like; remarkably, they are free
of charge. The hardware detection in the live
CD is identical to the hardware detection in the
Ubuntu installer, so if the live CD works, you can
be confident that the installer will work as well.
</p><p>
A DVD image also is available for Bittorrent
download. The DVD is suitable for installing Ubuntu
on a computer without Internet access. It can be
used as a live CD or as an install CD.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16cb580.0x17c3fa8"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installation is a straightforward process. Ubuntu 5.04 has
a text-based installer, but it is easy to use and
has excellent hardware detection. In the simplest
case&mdash;installing to a blank hard disk&mdash;it
handles partitioning and formatting automatically.
Manual partitioning is possible as well, allowing
you to delete and create partitions and format them
as ext3, ext2, ReiserFS, JFS, XFS, FAT16 or FAT32 filesystems, all
with LVM or RAID support. By pressing Alt-F2, you can access a second
virtual terminal and use a root shell to set up your partitions by hand.
</p><p>
If the system has a connection to the Internet during the installation,
the Ubuntu installer automatically finds and installs the latest
package versions so your new Ubuntu system is fully up to date. And,
thanks to the Kubuntu Project, an install CD that includes KDE also is
available. Ubuntu 5.04 also offers support for network installs using Kickstart.
</p><p>
If you want to add additional desktop environments such as Xfce, after
the initial install you can enable the universe component (see below)
and install the necessary packages. In addition, you can choose the server install
option to get a minimal Ubuntu system and then manually install exactly
the packages you choose.
</p><p>
As is generally true of Debian-based systems, you
need to run the installer only once. Even major
releases can be updated using the standard package
management tools. However, keep the install CD handy to
use as a rescue disk.
</p><p>
If you have an NVIDIA or ATI graphics adapter and you want to use the
vendor's proprietary binary drivers, with Ubuntu you can easily install
the packages from the restricted package set. Furthermore, as updates to those
drivers are released, your system can install them automatically.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16cb580.0x17c4210"></a>
Cutting-Edge GNOME Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu Linux 5.04 is based on the GNOME 2.10 desktop environment. It
features the latest slick GNOME features from the GNOME developers as
well as a few new features added by the Ubuntu developers. It uses the
X.org X server.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8278f1.large.jpg"><img src="8278f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The GNOME desktop with a CD-ROM, a server called
uma and a USB Flash drive all mounted. Music is playing.
An update is available (red icon, upper right).
</p></div></div><p>
The theme, desktop art and applets shown in Figure
1 are all out-of-the-box Ubuntu defaults. I had
the mouse pointer hovering over the red update icon in order
to read the tool tip saying that two new packages
are available; the screenshot tool does not capture
the mouse pointer.
</p><p>
Ubuntu is developed on a six-month cycle, as is the GNOME
desktop itself. Each Ubuntu release will include
the latest GNOME release. Canonical has promised
to provide security updates for each release for at
least 18 months.
</p><p>
Ubuntu has a clean desktop philosophy, so your desktop
initially is completely empty of icons and files.
The Ubuntu developers wrote some GNOME applets, however, that
allow all features of GNOME to be accessed from GNOME
panels. For example, the Trash Can applet gives access
to the Trash folder without needing to move any open
windows to get to the desktop. Of course, you are
free to put icons on your desktop if you prefer.
</p><p>
The GNOME menus are located on the top left of the default Ubuntu
desktop, and as of GNOME 2.10, the menus are Applications,
Places and System. The Applications menu
includes icons to launch applications, filed into
categories such as Games and Internet.
The Places menu includes icons to open a file
manager window for the user's home directory,
the user's Desktop and a place called Computer,
with all storage devices available on the computer.
The Places menu also includes any locations the user
has bookmarked from the file manager, as well as a few
icons for accessing network servers, searching for
files or viewing the most recently used documents
list. The System menu is used for setting GNOME
preferences, system administration, getting GNOME
help and closing a GNOME session. Overall, these three menus
are an excellent way to organize the system
menus; it's easy to remember where to look for things.
</p><p>
The GNOME 2.10 desktop in Ubuntu is an excellent choice for beginning
computer users. Thanks to the GNOME Volume Manager, GNOME does sensible
things when a user works with storage devices. For example, when the
user inserts a CD audio disk into a CD drive, the GNOME CD player
automatically runs.
</p><p>
When the user plugs in a USB Flash drive, it is recognized, mounted and a
file manager window opens that shows the mounted device. In addition, an
icon appears on the desktop with a name such as 256M Removable Media, and
an identical icon appears in the Places menu. Users coming from other
OSes should learn to use the Unmount Volume command before unplugging the
USB device, but as long as they don't unplug the device while it actually
is writing data, nothing bad happens if they simply unplug it. The system
simply removes the icon from the desktop and the Places menu.
</p><p>
Other removable devices are handled in similarly slick fashion. Plugging
in a device with photos, such as a digital camera, results in a pop-up
dialog offering to import the photos.
</p><p>
The GNOME file manager, by default, runs in a
spatial mode where each place you can visit with the
file manager opens in its own window, and the location
and size of each of these windows are remembered.
A browser window mode also is available, and a
check box in the file manager preferences&mdash;Always
open in browser windows&mdash;can be used to set the
browser window mode as the default.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16cb580.0x17c4790"></a>
Package Management</h2></div></div><p>
As noted before, Ubuntu is based on Debian GNU/Linux.
Debian's package management system, APT (Advanced
Packaging Tool) is famously easy to use. As long as
your system has access to a server with the package
you want, a single command installs the
package and automatically brings in any other packages
needed by the one you requested. There is no charge for downloading new
packages or security updates.
</p><p>
Using the <tt  >apt-get</tt> command-line tool, it also is possible to update your
system, automatically retrieving any new versions of the packages you
already have. There is also an ncurses-based character-mode tool called
aptitude that makes it easy to browse packages, plus a GNOME graphical
package browser called Synaptic Package Manager. All of these have
been standard in Ubuntu since the first release.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8278f2.large.jpg"><img src="8278f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Synaptic Package Manager showing the LyX packages.
</p></div></div><p>
With the 5.04 release, Ubuntu has made package management even easier,
and the most common cases are now extremely simple and
discoverable.
When updated packages become available, a bright red icon appears in the
notification area. Clicking on the icon launches the Ubuntu Update Manager,
which shows a list of packages with available updates; one click on the
Install button updates the Ubuntu system to the latest packages. This
handles both security updates and feature updates.

Figure 4. The Ubuntu Update Manager showing that the system is up to
date.
</p></div></div><p>
Under Applications/System Tools there is a launcher
for the Add/Remove Programs dialog, another new
feature to Ubuntu 5.04. The most common programs
a user might want appear here, along with an icon, a
friendly name and a terse explanation of what the
program does. Simply marking a check box next to the
program name selects that program for installation.
Clicking on the Advanced button brings up the
Synaptic Package Manager, which can perform any
package management task. Expert users probably will
go straight to Synaptic or aptitude, but beginners
will appreciate this feature.

applications.
</p></div></div><p>
The Ubuntu packages are divided among four components: main,
restricted, universe and multiverse. With all four package components enabled,
an Ubuntu system has access to more than 16,000 different packages.
Packages that are installed by default are listed
in the main or restricted components. Main
contains completely free software, plus some fonts and
binary firmware files that are redistributable but not
actually free software. Restricted contains non-free
proprietary software distributed with restrictions,
such as NVIDIA video drivers.
</p><p>
Ubuntu is free to distribute, install and use,
and the restricted packages are essential to make
a distribution that simply works, out of the
box, on all common hardware. If you want to avoid
proprietary software, you can remove the restricted
component from your package sources.
</p><p>
The universe and multiverse components are
disabled by default. Universe contains many
thousands of packages from Debian GNU/Linux, compiled
for Ubuntu but tested very little and not supported.
Multiverse contains proprietary packages, such as
Adobe Acrobat Reader 7.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16cb580.0x17bba70"></a>
Using Ubuntu</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu comes standard with a solid assortment of software&mdash;OpenOffice.org
office suite, The GIMP image editor, Evolution e-mail client and Firefox
Web browser&mdash;all the basics you would expect to find on a modern Linux desktop system by default.
</p><p>
Using the Synaptic Package Manager you easily can search through the
thousands of packages and select new ones; a click downloads and
installs them. It's really fun to browse through the package listings,
shopping for new software. Any software that Ubuntu does not install
by default can be added easily, which is a real strength of the APT
package management system.
</p><p>
Before you use Ubuntu, I suggest you look over the tips collected on the
Ubuntu Guide Web site. It's a treasure trove of useful information.
</p><p>
A major hole in GNOME 2.10, however, is the lack of a menu editor. GNOME 2.10
adopted the new freedesktop.org menu standard, so older menu editors
don't work, and there simply wasn't a new menu editor available to ship
as part of GNOME 2.10. However, all of the packages in the Ubuntu base
system are good about putting launchers in the menu, so the typical
Ubuntu user does not need a menu editor. If you want to install a menu
editor, you can install the KDE Menu Editor (provided by the kmenuedit
package) or
follow the step-by-step instructions from the Ubuntu Guide Web site to
install a simple GNOME Menu Editor.
</p><p>
The six-month release cycle may cause this sort of rough edge to
appear again in the future. But given how easy it is to update an
Ubuntu system, any real problems that turn up can be fixed with updated
packages. For example, once there is an official Ubuntu menu editor,
all Ubuntu systems will get it when they update their packages.
</p><p>
If you want to use the universe packages, I suggest you set up the
Debian menus. The universe packages may not add menu entries to the
GNOME desktop menu, but they almost always add entries to the Debian
menu. Install the menu and menu-xdg packages, and the Debian menu
appears under Applications/Debian.
</p><p>
Ubuntu does not come standard with support for legally encumbered media
technologies such as MP3 audio or MPEG2 video. The Restricted Formats
page on the Ubuntu Web site discusses the situation.
</p><p>
For system administration, Ubuntu encourages you to use
<tt  >sudo</tt>. By
default, no root password is set. You can get a root shell by
running <tt  >sudo -s</tt>.

Support and Community</h2></div></div><p>
Paid support for Ubuntu is available directly from Canonical, and it is the
only way Canonical profits from Ubuntu. Canonical offers full support
for packages in main, limited support for packages in restricted
and no support for software in universe or multiverse. In addition, companies
other than Canonical are offering support for Ubuntu. A list of support
companies is available on the ubuntulinux.org Web site.
</p><p>
Ubuntu has a large and growing community. Much of the
documentation is community-written Wiki documentation.
There are also Web forums, mailing lists and an
IRC channel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16cb580.0x17bc1a8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Ubuntu Linux is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to run Linux on
a desktop system. It's easy to install and to administer. Everyone
from beginners to experts can use and appreciate it. And it's free. If
you are looking for a new Linux distribution, give Ubuntu a try.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16cb580.0x17bc2b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Debian and Ubuntu</b></p><p>
Debian and Ubuntu have a close relationship. Ubuntu is built on top of
Debian, using Debian tools and starting with Debian packages. However,
the two projects cannot mesh perfectly.
</p><p>
Debian supports many different architectures,
including ones considered obsolete, such as Motorola
68K; Ubuntu currently supports only three.
Debian eschews hard deadlines for releases, while
Ubuntu has committed to making a release every six
months. Ubuntu already has transitioned to X.org's
X11 system, while Debian still is using XFree86
release 4.3. Many packages from Ubuntu would install
poorly on a Debian system, and vice versa.
</p><p>
Are Debian and Ubuntu fated to drift even farther apart? Debian cannot
match Ubuntu's six-month release cycle without making major changes, and
it probably shouldn't try. But once Debian finishes its next release,
it likely will update Debian from Ubuntu, bringing the two projects
somewhat closer together again.
</p><p>
The Debian Project and the Ubuntu Project have similar aims. Some of
the Ubuntu developers are Debian developers too, and improvements and
bug fixes done for Ubuntu are fed back into Debian as much as possible.
Although other Debian-based distributions of Linux have branched off
completely from Debian in the past, Ubuntu is making an effort to
maintain closer ties.
