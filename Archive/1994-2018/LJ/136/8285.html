<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #136, August 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

Linux kernel development was thrown into chaos
recently, when <span   class="bold"><b>Larry McVoy</b></span> finally decided to pull the
free-of-charge <span   class="bold"><b>BitKeeper</b></span> license as he has threatened many times
to do. But within days of the event, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> and
a horde of contributors had written an acceptable
alternative, entirely from scratch. The git filesystem
is Linus' brainchild, a low-level, extremely fast
content tracker that appears to be almost completely
alien to existing version-control ideas. Virtually
opaque, it is intended to exist beneath a layer of
scripts that make use of its various services. Anyone
can script a new git user layer on top of the basic
system. In fact, <span   class="bold"><b>Petr Baudis</b></span> has been working with
tons of folks on <span   class="bold"><b>Cogito</b></span>, a git front end that looks to
be Linus' choice for ongoing kernel development. Many
Web interfaces and other auxiliary tools also are
springing into existence at a rapid rate.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span> has been keeping
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel.org</b></span> up to date with all the latest git
repositories, arranging for hosting services and
generally tending house. Recently, however, kernel.org
began yet again to bog down with the tremendous
bandwidth demands from all over the world. This time,
<span   class="bold"><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></span> was the one to charge to the
rescue, donating two powerful computers. kernel.org
will now operate as a DNS round-robin between both.
This has reduced site latency significantly, and it
drastically sped up upload time for site contributors
as well. At last report, nary a glitch remained,
although the round-robin does make it more difficult
to derive network traffic statistics.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Joel Becker</b></span> has created <span   class="bold"><b>ConfigFS</b></span>,
another interface into kernel internals. The goal
this time is to create something scriptable and
completely readable. But with SysFS already in
existence and performing a similar function, it's
unclear whether ConfigFS will represent a true
advance or just another addition to the mess. All
of these filesystem-based interfaces have been born
out of a desire to recover somehow from the ProcFS,
/dev, ioctl nightmares Linux inherited from its great
progenitors. But if these new alternatives themselves
are not sufficient, SysFS, udev and now ConfigFS
become only more legacy cruft to be hated by kernel
developers for years to come.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>FUSE</b></span> (Filesystem in USErspace)
developers either are cleaning house or making a new
mess. <span   class="bold"><b>Miklos Szeredi</b></span> posted some patches to
make the user interface compatible between 32-bit
and 64-bit modes of operation, on systems that
supported both modes. Among its various benefits,
the patch breaks the backward compatibility of
the user interface. With FUSE already in <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew
Morton</b></span>'s -mm kernel tree, this patch may be one
painful yet required step along the bridge into the
official kernel; or it may be a descent into breakage,
on the way out of Andrew's tree altogether. Time will
tell. At the last previous report, the FUSE developers
were making good progress toward answering some of
Linus' harsher objections, and he was no longer
so completely dead set against even the idea of a
user-space filesystem.
</p><p>
After a public discussion between the two groups
of developers on the <span   class="bold"><b>open-iscsi</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>linux-iscsi</b></span> projects, they have decided to
merge into a single project. For technical reasons,
both groups have agreed to start from the open-iscsi
codebase, because of that project's optimized
input/output paths and the well tested iscsi-sfnet
components for the control plane and user-space
components. The open-iscsi Subversion repository
will continue to be used, at least for now. This
unification of two projects working toward the same
goal is excellent. Hopefully most of the linux-iscsi
group will remain and continue to contribute; and
their previous accomplishments will continue to
be recognized, in spite of the migration to a new
codebase.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Randy Dunlap</b></span> is leading the charge to
reorganize the kernel's networking configuration
options. This has been an ugly task to consider,
because in many cases it is not at all clear how best
to organize the hierarchy. Is something a driver,
or is it a protocol? Should all drivers be grouped
together, or is it all right to group some drivers
with a specific related subsystem? Randy bit the
bullet and made a first pass at answering some of
these questions and was quickly joined by several
other folks. With much wrangling, soul-searching
and a little guesswork, an entirely new landscape
of network configuration seems to be
forming gradually. We should expect to see portions of this
landscape with periodic minor earthquakes in upcoming
2.6 releases.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I think
best when I'm in front of a whiteboard drawing boxes
and arrows. However, when it's time to put the idea up
on a Web site, it's either upload huge photos of the
whiteboard or spend hours dragging little boxes and
arrows around in some GUI application. Graphviz to
the rescue. I made this diagram in 15 lines of
easy markup (yes, <tt  >-&gt;</tt> makes a line with an arrow)
and converted it with one command. Multicolored
boxes and lines take just a little more time with
the on-line docs.
</p><p>
Graphviz really shines when it's time to generate
big graphs from your own software. No matter how
complicated a structure your program spits out,
Graphviz turns it into a readable layout. See the
Web site for examples.

The best cases for Linux and open source in business
often come from the resourceful people who put it to use
there. What they provide are patches of wisdom that
add to everyone's understanding. Eventually, resistance
becomes futile because the advantages are understood
too well. Here are three such &ldquo;patches&rdquo; from comments
to just one <i  >Linux Journal</i> on-line article:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
With GNU/BSD licensed software at least, the receiver of the
codebase is left in complete control. Even Microsoft could grab a
copy of the code and configure/support it the same as with the
Windows codebase. There's no corporate competition from OSS/Free
software, just service companies that sell packages including
it.  &mdash;Chris Bergeron of <a href="http://pcburn.com" target="_self">pcburn.com</a>.
</p><p>
In my experience, the main reason for buying into open-source
projects goes far beyond &ldquo;wanting something the market doesn't
offer&rdquo;. It's more about servicing business needs quickly. Who can
wait for a vendor to respond to a request, when it's so much easier
to take pre-existing OSS systems or code and improve them slightly
to solve your particular problem? With ever-decreasing time frames,
OSS makes the impossible possible.  &mdash;Dave Moskovitz of
<a href="http://www.thinktank.co.nz/dave" target="_self">www.thinktank.co.nz/dave</a>.
</p><p>
For an IT professional, it often takes less time to install and
configure an open-source package than to get approval to
&ldquo;buy&rdquo;
(actually, enter into a license for) a proprietary one. Transaction
costs aren't just between vendor organization and customer
organization&mdash;they're within organizations.  &mdash;Anonymous

LinuxFest Northwest, the largest users group
conference in the Pacific Northwest, was held again
in Bellingham, Washington, 20 miles south of the
Canadian border. Among the presenters was Google's
Chris DiBona, shown here updating the audience on
code.google.com, the portal site for the company's
open-source projects.
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8285linuxfestf1.large.jpg"><img src="8285linuxfestf1.jpg"></a></div>

</p><p>
LinuxFest Northwest was put on by the Bellingham
Linux Users Group and six other groups, and hosted by
Bellingham Technical College (BTC). As in previous
years, LinuxFest was free of charge and open to all;
an estimated 1,000 people attended.
</p><p>
More than 40 presentations covered topics from
general interest to advanced systems administration.
Presenters included people from IBM, Novell,
RealNetworks, the Linux Professional Institute,
the X.org Foundation and the Ubuntu Project.
</p><p>
The BTC Chefs Club served a grilled salmon lunch and
espresso drinks.
</p><p>
The exhibits room included Google recruiters, some
users groups, some free software projects, such as
Ubuntu Linux and MySQL, and even the Seattle BSD
users group.
</p><p>
For the second year, Chuck Wolber hosted the &ldquo;Alpha
Geek&rdquo; trivia contest, which was a great deal of fun.
The day finished with the annual fund-raising raffle.
Several thousand dollars' worth of donated prizes
included server hosting services for up to a year.

Whether you've built your Ultimate Linux Box, or if
you're trying to get maximum speed out of a lesser
machine, it's time to set it up for optimum speed
for desktop applications. In a series of articles on
&ldquo;Optimizing Desktop Performance&rdquo;, Tom Adelstein covers
desktop performance tweaks from simple tools such
as hdparm all the way up to a script that will make
OpenOffice.org stay in memory and start more quickly when
you open a document. Follow along with the comments

DIYparts.org is what Christian Einfeldt calls &ldquo;a bazaar where people can
develop connoisseurship around putting open-source software on old but
useful boxes, thereby keeping them out of landfill&rdquo;. Christian is the
filmmaker behind the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Digital Tipping Point</em></span>
documentary, and he co-created
DIYparts.org with Adam Doxtater of Mad Penguin.
Think of DIYparts.org as a swapfest for used gear of all kinds&mdash;from
cases and motherboards to drives, monitors, racks, controllers, video
cards, interface cards, PDAs and much more.

In fact, the business population was as likely as the prison and
psychiatric populations to demonstrate the traits associated with
narcissistic personality disorder: grandiosity, lack of empathy,
exploitativeness and independence. They were also as likely to have
traits associated with compulsive personality disorder: stubbornness,
dictatorial tendencies, perfectionism and an excessive devotion to work.
