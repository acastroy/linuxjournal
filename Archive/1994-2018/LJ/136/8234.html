Your Linux system's sound probably just
came up and worked, which is great for games, chat or
music listening. But with a little exploration, you
can unlock the recording studio inside your hardware.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e2580.0x28da2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Since the public release of the 2.6 Linux stable kernel series, the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) has become the default kernel
sound system. This change brings significant improvements to Linux
audio and MIDI capabilities, including support for professional audio hardware,
3-D surround sound, advanced MIDI functions and software mixing or audio
stream multiplexing. When combined with a kernel patched for low latency,
ALSA provides resources for sound and MIDI that compare well
with competing platforms and in some respects are superior to them. This
is a bold claim, so let's look at ALSA to see what makes it tick.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e2580.0x28da3f8"></a>
Our Story Begins</h2></div></div><p>
The ALSA Project began when a young programmer named
Jaroslav Kysela became frustrated with the kernel
sound system's lack of full support for his Gravis
Ultrasound audio/MIDI card. The Gravis card created
its sounds by using sampled sounds stored in the
card's memory in a file format known as PAT (patch).
Banks of PAT sounds could be edited and stored
by the user, as long as the user was running Microsoft
Windows or Apple Mac OS. Linux, sad to say, did not
provide such comprehensive resources, leaving Jaroslav
with a sound card that was not fully operational.
</p><p>
At that time, the Linux kernel sound system was the
OSS/Free system, a solid and serviceable audio/MIDI
subsystem that had been with the kernel sources
since the early days of Linux, thanks primarily
to the pioneering work of Hannu Savolainen. Alas,
OSS/Free had not kept pace with the rapidly evolving
world of desktop audio production, and many sound cards
either were unsupported or supported only partially,
as was the case with the Gravis boards. To be fair,
the OSS/Free maintainers were few; there was less
organization in the general Linux audio world;
and manufacturers then were, as some still are now,
too secretive about their driver specifications.
</p><p>
It might have been possible to incorporate greater support for the
Gravis cards into OSS/Free, but as Jaroslav Kysela researched the
OSS/Free applications programming interface (API), he realized
there was a need for a new API that could support more broadly the
developments taking place with modern sound cards and digital audio
interfaces. Professional and consumer-level expectations had risen, demanding
support for features such as high sample rates and
bit depths for professional recording, 5.1 and other 3-D/surround sound
audio output arrays; multichannel digital audio I/O; and multiple MIDI
I/O ports. There simply were too many advances that required fundamental
changes in OSS/Free, so Jaroslav did what any truly hard-core Linux
coder does: he designed a new audio/MIDI API for Linux, calling it the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.
</p><p>
Designing and implementing an API that would encompass the requirements of
contemporary audio is a non-trivial task, and ALSA needed many years,
many programmers and many releases to attain its current status as the
kernel sound system. In its earlier stages, normal users had to install the
system by hand, normally as a replacement for the OSS/Free system, in order
to acquire support for a card or the extended features of a card. This
process included uninstalling OSS/Free and recompiling the kernel for
ALSA support, at that time a decidedly non-trivial task. Nevertheless,
the ranks of dedicated ALSA users grew, development flourished and
eventually ALSA was incorporated into the Linux 2.5 kernel development
track. Finally, with the public release of the 2.6 kernel series, ALSA
became the default kernel sound system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e2580.0x28da608"></a>
What Is ALSA?</h2></div></div><p>
The ALSA home page gives us the following information:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture provides audio and MIDI
functionality to the Linux operating system. ALSA has the following
significant features:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Efficient support for all types of audio interfaces, from consumer sound cards to professional multichannel audio interfaces.
</p></li><li><p>
Fully modularized sound drivers.
</p></li><li><p>
SMP and thread-safe design.
</p></li><li><p>
User-space library (alsa-lib) to simplify application programming and provide higher level functionality.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for the older OSS API, providing binary compatibility for most OSS programs.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
ALSA is released under the GPL (GNU General Public license) and the LGPL
(GNU Lesser General Public License).
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Let's look at each one of these features, restating them in language
more comprehensible to a normal user.
</p><p>
Efficient support means that you can manage the basic and advanced features of
supported sound cards easily, using
ALSA tools such as a sound card configuration utility and mixer
programs. Such tools are integral components of the complete ALSA
installation.
</p><p>
Modularized sound drivers means that ALSA sound card
drivers are easy to install and update. They also
provide the means by which the user can control
a card's available options in more detail. Later
in this article, we show how you can work with a
driver module to access and control features of an
ALSA-supported sound card.
</p><p>
ALSA supports multiprocessor, or SMP, machines.
Thread-safe is a programming term that indicates
the services provided by the software can run concurrently in different
threads without bothering each other. In a modern audio/MIDI
application, thread safety is a Very Good Thing.
</p><p>
ALSA's user-space library provides programmers, and hence their
programs, with easy access to ALSA's services, and its significance to the normal
user may seem a rather slight matter. However, the ALSA library provides
the interface through which applications can reach those functions,
helping form a more homogeneous environment at the user level. Your
programs can run more harmoniously with one another, with enhanced
possibilities for connection and communication between applications.
</p><p>
ALSA evolved during the first phase of Linux sound
support when most applications were using the
OSS/Free API, so an OSS/Free compatibility layer
was an immediate necessity for normal users. A large
number of Linux sound applications still need OSS/Free
compatibility, so ALSA provides seamless support
for the older API. However, programmers should note
that the older API now officially is deprecated.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e2580.0x28dadf0"></a>
Installing and Configuring</h2></div></div><p>
Full details regarding installation are available on the ALSA home page
(see the on-line Resources),
so I mention here only a few details and clarifications. If you're using
a distribution or customized Linux system based on a 2.6 kernel, ALSA
already is installed. Distros and systems based on
earlier kernels require a manual ALSA installation.
</p><p>
Installing ALSA is not especially difficult, and the way has been
cleared at least partially by packages supplied by audio-centric Linux
distributions/bundles, such as AGNULA/Demudi for Debian, PlanetCCRMA for
Red Hat and Fedora and AudioSlack for SlackWare. Mandrake users can
install one of Thac's packages (see Resources).
Regardless of your base system, you must uninstall the OSS/Free
modules before installing the ALSA package. Normally this task entails
little more than moving the older modules into a temporary directory,
in case you want or need to put them back, and making sure that the
kernel's soundcore.o object file remains in its original place, usually
/lib/modules/<span   class="emphasis"><em>your-kernel-number-here</em></span>/kernel/drivers/sound/. After
removing OSS/Free you need to install the ALSA packages by way of your
package manager of choice.
</p><p>
ALSA configuration has improved greatly over the years, but it still can be
a tricky procedure, especially if your system has more than one
sound device or if the device is connected to your computer on the USB or
PCMCIA bus. Obviously, I can't go into the details regarding every possible
configuration, but fortunately the ALSA Web site contains a large number
of configuration pages for supported devices, often including tips and
tricks from other users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e2580.0x28db000"></a>
Basic Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Basic configuration can be done with the alsaconf utility (Figure
1). alsaconf works well at recognizing single devices, but it might
not do so well with systems containing multiple devices. Don't worry;
it's still fairly simple to accommodate multiple audio and MIDI devices,
and we return to that task in a few moments. For now, let's proceed
as though you have only one audio device for your machine.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8234f1.large.jpg"><img src="8234f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The alsaconf configuration tool is good
for finding sound hardware on systems with one sound
card installed.
</p></div></div><p>
After alsaconf has set up basic support for your
sound device, you need to activate its playback and
record channels. By default, ALSA started with all channels
of your device muted. It may be an annoyance for some
users, but it certainly reduces the likelihood of
inadvertently blowing up your speakers when you first
start your new system. You can set your sound device's
channel capabilities with ALSA's alsamixer utility,
a character-graphics mixer complete with sliders
and switches for each channel of the detected device
(Figure 2). Use the arrow keys to select a channel,
use the &lt;&gt; keys to unmute/mute channels, and use the
spacebar to select a channel as a recording source
(capture, in ALSA-speak). When you've set your
mixer preferences, run the alsactl utility to save
and recall your settings (<tt  >alsactl store|restore</tt>).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8234f2.large.jpg"><img src="8234f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. By default, ALSA starts with sound muted, so
you need to set audio channel values with alsamixer.
</p></div></div><p>
As you already can see, ALSA thoughtfully provides a number of useful
tools to help configure the system. If you want to know more details
about using those tools, simply run the utility with the -h option or use
the man command to see a more detailed description. The
following examples display the manual pages for the utilities I've
mentioned already:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >man alsaconf</tt>
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >man alsamixer</tt>
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >man alsactl</tt>
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e2580.0x28db8f0"></a>
Advanced Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we've considered some of the basic
installation and configuration details, let's look at
how we might set up a more complicated system. For
the following example, I've used the configuration
details for my laptop system, a Pentium II 366MHz
HP Omnobook 4150 with a combined audio/video chipset
manufactured by NeoMagic.
</p><p>
Setting up laptop audio support under Linux can be a complicated task, and
it just so happens that my hardware is slightly problematic. Thankfully,
ALSA supplies the tools I needed to resolve my difficulties with finding
the correct chip and driver identification.
</p><p>
The alsaconf utility tries to identify your system's audio and
MIDI capabilities and then it writes a basic configuration file to
/etc/modules.conf. However, in the weird world of laptop sound support,
things may not always be what they seem. For example, alsaconf
correctly identified my laptop audio chip as a NeoMagic NM256. However,
the configuration failed, reporting that I should use either the basic
SoundBlaster16 driver (sb16) or one of the Crystal Sound drivers (cs423x).
</p><p>
On the advice of ALSA guru Takashi Iwai, I tried using alsaconf to set
up the driver for the CS4232 chipset features, selecting the cs4232
module from alsaconf's list of non-PnP ISA chipsets. When I chose to
probe for all possible DMA and IRQ settings, my machine locked up,
freezing the keyboard and forcing a power-down and cold boot. To be
fair, I must mention that alsaconf warned me that might happen. Happily,
when I rejected the more aggressive search, alsaconf completed its task
gracefully and added the following section to my /etc/modules.conf file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
	# --- BEGIN: Generated by ALSACONF, do not edit. ---
	# --- ALSACONF version 1.0.4 ---
alias char-major-116 snd
alias snd-card-0 snd-cs4232
alias char-major-14 soundcore
alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss
alias snd-card-1 snd-virmidi
alias sound-slot-1 snd-card-1
	# --- END: Generated by ALSACONF, do not edit. ---
</pre>
</p><p>
Alsaconf merely set up a series of aliases for the general and
card-specific services ALSA can provide for my machine. For normal
use this section should remain as alsaconf generates it. By the way,
the entries for the virmidi modules are there because I'm running
Red Hat 9 with the ALSA packages from PlanetCCRMA, a suite of
components for setting up a low-latency, high-performance Linux audio/MIDI
workstation. PlanetCCRMA installs the virtual MIDI modules by default.
</p><p>
Next, I edited the driver options in /etc/modules.conf. In this section,
I can customize various features of my sound chip, setting I/O port
and IRQ addresses, enabling or disabling onboard synth capability
and defining the DMA channels.
</p><p>
I ran <tt  >alsaconf -P</tt> to see a list of the legacy non-PnP modules:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# alsaconf -P
opl3sa2 cs4236 cs4232 cs4231 es18xx es1688 sb16 sb8
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, I probed the CS4232 driver for its default options settings:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# alsaconf -p cs4232
port=0x534 cport=0x538 isapnp=0 dma1=1 dma2=0 irq=5
</pre>
</p><p>
I could have accepted these values and had a working audio system, but thanks again to
Takashi Iwai, I discovered that I also could enable an
onboard synth chip, the Yamaha OPL3, an inexpensive
4-operator FM synthesizer notorious for its ubiquity
in inexpensive sound cards and its general cheesiness
of sound. Takashi also advised entering and disabling
an option for a physical MIDI port, simply to indicate
its presence as a chipset feature. Thus, my current
options section in /etc/modules.conf now includes
this more complete configuration for the CS4232:

<pre     class="programlisting">
options snd-cs4232 port=0x534 cport=0x538 mpu_port=-1
&#8618;fm_port=0x388 irq=5 dma1=1 dma2=0 isapnp=0
</pre>
</p><p>
With this configuration, I now have working audio
I/O and a cheesy onboard FM synthesizer. However,
the synthesizer needs a set of sound patches before
it can make any sound, and of course ALSA supplies
the needed utility (sbiload) to load the patch data
into the synth&mdash;ALSA even supplies the patches. I
use the loader as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sbiload -p 65:0 --opl3 \
/home/dlphilp/soundfiles/sbi-patches/std.o3 \
/home/dlphilp/soundfiles/sbi-patches/drums.o3

</pre>
</p><p>
The options include the required target port
(determined with <tt  >aconnect -o</tt>) and a switch for
either OPL2 or OPL3 support; the OPL2 is only a
2-operator FM synth. The example's patches are
included with the ALSA tools (see <tt  >locate *.o3</tt> and
<tt  >locate *.db</tt> for locations). A few other patch sets
for the OPL3 are available on the Internet, and Patch
editors also are available.
</p><p>
At this point, I opened alsamixer to set the channel status for the
CS4232. Figure 2 shown above displays the results. I now could play OGG
and other music files (PCM), listen to my music CDs (Aux1) and watch
and listen to DVDs and other video formats (Aux). I could record analog
audio through either a microphone input or line-in jack, and I even could
listen to MIDI music files played by the soundchip synth (Aux1). By
default, I can do only one of those activities at a time, but ALSA supplies
a neat plugin for software mixing, which I describe later.
</p><p>
By the way, on Red Hat or Fedora the entire ALSA
system can be started and stopped with these commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/init.d/alsasound start
/etc/init.d/alsasound stop
/etc/init.d/alsasound restart
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have installed the Debian packages, the file
is /etc/init.d/alsa. This feature makes it easy to test new configurations. The exact location
of the alsasound control can be determined with <tt  >locate
alsasound</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e2580.0x28d2ac8"></a>
The ALSA Virtual MIDI Module</h2></div></div><p>
The observant reader might wonder how I can route MIDI
data without the benefit of MIDI hardware. Thanks
to ALSA's virmidi module, my system has four virtual
devices usable as raw MIDI I/O ports for any other
ALSA sequencer clients. The sequencer of what is
known as the ALSA sequencer API is not a sequencing
application such as MusE or Rosegarden. This
sequencer manages the merging and timing of freely
interconnected MIDI data streams, including multiple
connections to single ports. Compliance with the
ALSA sequencer API allows each client to
interconnect freely to one or more other clients, and it
has become an expected capability of modern Linux
audio software.
</p><p>
The ALSA aconnect utility tells me what ports are available for
connection via the ALSA sequencer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
aconnect -i
client 0: 'System' [type=kernel]
    0 'Timer           '
    1 'Announce        '
client 72: 'Virtual Raw MIDI 1-0' [type=kernel]
    0 'VirMIDI 1-0     '
client 73: 'Virtual Raw MIDI 1-1' [type=kernel]
    0 'VirMIDI 1-1     '
client 74: 'Virtual Raw MIDI 1-2' [type=kernel]
    0 'VirMIDI 1-2     '
client 75: 'Virtual Raw MIDI 1-3' [type=kernel]
    0 'VirMIDI 1-3     '
</pre>
</p><p>
This report indicates that I have four virtual MIDI ports. Whatever
software I assign to those ports then can be connected to any other ALSA
sequencer clients:


<pre     class="programlisting">
aconnect -o
client 65: 'OPL3 FM synth' [type=kernel]
    0 'OPL3 FM Port    '
client 72: 'Virtual Raw MIDI 1-0' [type=kernel]
    0 'VirMIDI 1-0     '
client 73: 'Virtual Raw MIDI 1-1' [type=kernel]
    0 'VirMIDI 1-1     '
client 74: 'Virtual Raw MIDI 1-2' [type=kernel]
    0 'VirMIDI 1-2     '
client 75: 'Virtual Raw MIDI 1-3' [type=kernel]
    0 'VirMIDI 1-3     '
</pre>
</p><p>
This report shows my available receiving ports. Thus, the following
command connects the first virmidi port to my onboard FM synth:

<pre     class="programlisting">
aconnect 72:0 65:0
</pre>
</p><p>
The kconnect, alsa-patch-bay and QJackCtl programs
provide graphic interfaces for device identification
and connection.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8234f3.large.jpg"><img src="8234f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A Basic Linux Laptop MIDI System
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 3 shows off a small but powerful MIDI sequencing system. The main
program is Rob Buse's seq24, a lightweight looping sequencer designed in
the style of the hardware sequencers of the 1980s and 90s. seq24 manages
its connections internally, and the figure conceals the connections
between the virtual keyboard and seq24 as well as the output targets for
the individual sequences. Some of the sequences have been routed to the
OPL3 synth; others have been sent to an instance of TiMidity running as
a Soundfont server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e2580.0x28d3048"></a>
A USB MIDI Interface</h2></div></div><p>
Like many other laptop owners, I've hooked up a USB device to my
machine, in this case a MIDIman 2x2 MidiSport. The MidiSport provides
two independent I/O ports, and yes, ALSA supports multiport MIDI
hardware. However, I don't always have my MidiSport with me when I use
this machine, so I prefer to load the USB module after setting up my
CS4232 and virmidi cards. To defeat the autoloading of my USB MIDI
module, I added these lines to /etc/hotplug/blacklist:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# So I can keep my preferred order of sound cards:
snd-usb-audio

# uhci ... usb-uhci handles the same pci class:
usb-uhci
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, I wrote the following script to configure and
activate the MidiSport 2x2:

<pre     class="programlisting">

echo "Loading MidiSport firmware..."
modprobe snd-usb-audio
sfxload -I \
  /usr/share/usb/ezusbmidi/ezusbmidi2x2.ihx \
  -D /proc/bus/usb/001/003
echo "Done !"

</pre>
</p><p>
The firmware and loader are included with the ALSA installation. You
may need to query the /proc/bus/usb filesystem for your available USB
identifiers, and you may need to try each identifier to find which one
applies to your hardware. Use the <tt  >cat</tt> command to list your identifier
numbers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat /proc/bus/usb/001/
001 003
</pre>
</p><p>
The system reports an error if you select the wrong identifier,
so at least in my case the trial-and-error process didn't last long.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e2580.0x28d33b8"></a>
A PCMCIA Audio Card</h2></div></div><p>
As though I hadn't already stuffed my little system
full of ALSA drivers, I also wanted to use the Core
Sound PDAudioCF card, a high-quality digital audio
input card made for handheld computers, such as
the Zaurus, but quite usable with a CF-to-PCMCIA
adapter. Again, I want to have my other devices
configured before setting up the PDAudioCF,
so I simply wait until I have everything else
working as desired before inserting the card. The
system autodetects the new hardware and loads the
appropriate module (snd-pdaudiocf), a procedure
totally transparent to the end user.
</p><p>
Using this card is easy. The following example illustrates the use
of ALSA's arecord utility to record a 30-second stereo digital audio
stream from the S/PDIF digital output of my desktop system's SBLive to
the PDAudioCF card:

<pre     class="programlisting">
arecord -f dat -D hw:3,0 -d 30 foo.wav
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-f dat</tt> option sets the recording format to include a sample
rate of 48kHz, which is the only output sample rate supported by the
SBLive. I substituted <tt  >-f cd</tt> for the DAT option and recorded again from
the S/PDIF output of my Delta 66, this time with the standard redbook CD
audio values, that is, 16-bit stereo audio with a sample rate of 44.1kHz. In
both cases, the recording and playback was flawless and had beautiful audio
quality, thanks to the PDAudioCD card. For more details regarding ALSA's
playback and record utilities, see <tt  >man aplay</tt> and
<tt  >man arecord</tt>.
</p><p>
Linux laptop sound support is a weird world, and I spent
considerable time getting things working properly. However, my machine now
has a sound system supporting stereo analog PCM I/O, a CD audio channel,
a MIDI-accessible onboard synthesizer, four virtual MIDI I/O ports,
an external 2x2 MIDI interface and a high-quality digital audio input
port. Not too shabby a set of capabilities for a PII 366, and, of
course, the real thanks go to ALSA.
</p><p>
By the way, if I forget the ordered numbering of my cards, I always can
query the proc filesystem for their numbers and status:

Thus, the specific hardware definitions would be hw:0, hw:1, hw:2 and
hw:3. hw:1 and hw:2 are MIDI-only devices and cannot be used for audio
purposes. And yes, proc is reporting a CS4231 where I've configured a
CS4232, but Takashi Iwai assured me that this behavior is normal for
the chipset. I know, it's weird.

Basic and Advanced Desktop Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
My desktop system has been much easier to configure. It still is a
fairly complex system, supporting one sound card&mdash;a SoundBlaster Live Value, with
external MIDI adapter&mdash;the virtual MIDI module and an M-Audio Delta
66 multichannel audio interface.
</p><p>
As with the OPL3 synthesizer on my laptop, I must load sound data into the
SBLive's EMU10k1 hardware synthesizer, using the ALSA sfxload utility
to load soundfonts into the synth. This command configures my SBLive
synth with a General MIDI soundfont distributed with the sound card:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sfxload 8mbgmsfx
</pre>
</p><p>
Recently, developer Lee Revell significantly improved the ALSA driver
for the Creative Labs SBLive and Audigy sound cards, unlocking much
greater potential than was available through the previous drivers. Lee
followed the lead of the kX Project, an open-source Windows-based
project intended to open all the capabilities of the SBLive/Audigy cards,
including true multichannel I/O, access to the DSP registers and support
for x.1 surround sound. Lee's work greatly expands the recording and
playback possibilities for inexpensive hardware, bringing even more
value to Linux as a desktop music and sound workstation.
</p><p>
Installation and operation of the virtual MIDI driver for my desktop is exactly the
same as it was for my laptop. See the appropriate section above for the details.
</p><p>
Channel settings for my SBLive can be made using alsamixer, but setting
up my Delta 66 requires the use of the specialized envy24control mixer
(Figure 4). This mixer provides access to and control of the advanced
features of cards with the ice1712 chipsets, including the M-Audio
Delta cards.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8234f4.large.jpg"><img src="8234f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
ALSA easily handles systems with multiple cards. The ALSA utilities
usually include an option for specific card selection, as in these
examples for my SBLive and Delta cards:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alsactl restore 0
alsactl restore 2
alsamixer -c 0
alsamixer -c 2
</pre>
</p><p>
In my system, card 1 is the virtual MIDI card, which takes no channel
settings and therefore has no associated mixer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e2580.0x28d3e08"></a>
ALSA Plugins and the .asoundrc File</h2></div></div><p>
The ALSA plugins are utility services available through a file named
.asoundrc, typically placed in your home directory. Plugin services
include resampling, channel routing, sample format conversion and
software volume control. Please see the ALSA Wiki notes on .asoundrc
for detailed information regarding these and other ALSA plugins.
</p><p>
As I mentioned earlier, the default sound capability of my laptop is
restricted to only one application at a time. Fortunately, ALSA provides
a cool plugin called dmix, and its sole function is to provide a type
of audio stream multiplexing called software mixing. Unfortunately, ALSA
doesn't autodetect the need for the dmix plugin, so the user must prepare
the necessary components.
</p><p>
Here is the .asoundrc for my laptop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pcm.!default {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "dmixer"
}

pcm.dmixer  {
        type dmix
        ipc_key 1024
        slave {
            pcm "hw:0,0"
            period_time 0
            period_size 1024
            buffer_size 4096
            rate 32000
}
        bindings {
            0 0
            1 1
        }
}

pcm.dsp {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "dmixer"
}

ctl.dmixer {
        type hw
        card 0
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This file defines a new PCM device named dmixer, of the plugin type dmix,
which is slaved to the PCM capabilities of the sound chip. The plugin also
lets me tailor the sample rate to the capabilities of my hardware, easing
CPU demands.
</p><p>
With the dmix plugin I can run an audio player and a video player at the
same time. In case you're wondering why I might want to do such a thing,
consider that I often study t'ai chi videos available on DivX discs. The
video is usually wonderful, but the background music isn't always to
my liking, so it's nice to be able to listen to something more to my
taste. The following commands launch Andy Lo A Fo's neat alsaplayer
soundfile player and the MPlayer video player:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mplayer -ao alsa9:dmixer -aop list=volume:volume=0 \
  -framedrop foo.avi
alsaplayer -o alsa -d plug:dmixer cool-foo.mp3

</pre>
</p><p>
The video player's audio output is negated, thanks to MPlayer's software
volume control, while the alsaplayer plays my preferred music. Very cool
stuff, courtesy of the dmix plugin.
</p><p>
I have no special needs on my desktop system, but I've configured my
.asoundrc file for basic accommodations for the SBLive and the Delta 66:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pcm.emu10k1 {
        type hw
        card 0
}

ctl.emu10k1 {
        type hw
        card 0
}

pcm.Delta66 {
        type hw
        card 2
}

ctl.Delta66 {
        type hw
        card 2
}

pcm.DeltaPlug {
        type plug
        card 2
}

ctl.DeltaPlug {
        type plug
        card 2
}

pcm.DeltaPlugHW {
	type plughw
	card 2
}

ctl.DeltaPlugHW {
        type plughw
        card 2
}
</pre>
</p><p>
The card numbering reflects the ordering list when I query /proc/asound:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat /proc/asound/cards
0 [Live           ]: EMU10K1 - Sound Blaster Live!
                     Sound Blaster Live! (rev.8) at 0xd000, irq 3
1 [VirMIDI        ]: VirMIDI - VirMIDI
	             Virtual MIDI Card 1
2 [M66            ]: ICE1712 - M Audio Delta 66
	             M Audio Delta 66 at 0xd800, irq 5
</pre>
</p><p>
ALSA does not provide a default .asoundrc file, nor is it an absolute
necessity. However, many interesting ALSA features are accessible only
through .asoundrc, and the reader is advised to study the example
files found on the ALSA Web site.
</p><p>
For an advanced example, see Timo Sivula's El Cheapo HOWTO, a rather
amazing hardware/software hack that allows sample-accurate multichannel
recording using two or more consumer-grade sound cards (Timo used the
Creative Labs PCI128). Under normal circumstances, such an approach would
be doomed to fail from inherent instabilities between the clock crystals
of the cards, but Timo's hardware modifications and the capabilities of
.asoundrc make it possible. The El Cheapo HOWTO is not for the faint
of heart, but it does succeed at providing an inexpensive path to
high-quality multichannel recording on the Linux desktop.

A Brief Note Regarding JACK</h2></div></div><p>
Figure 4 shows off the envy24control mixer in a JACK environment. JACK is
an audio connections manager designed to professional specifications for
low-latency communication between the JACK server and its clients. JACK
requires a native system audio driver, which for Linux can be a dummy
driver, an OSS driver, PortAudio or, most typically,
ALSA. I will present the JACK system in detail in a future article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27e2580.0x28d4490"></a>
The ALSA Applications Software Base</h2></div></div><p>
It is no exaggeration to state that all contemporary major Linux
audio software wants ALSA's special services. MIDI programs enjoy the
connectivity of the ALSA sequencer, digital audio systems make use of
ALSA's drivers for pro-audio hardware and thorough support is provided
for common desktop audio/video activities. Figures 5 and 6 represent
some screens commonly seen on my desktop, thanks to ALSA.

Future Work</h2></div></div><p>
From the normal user's point of view, ALSA's most obvious weakness is in
its lack of GUI front ends for the various tools and utilities that make
up so much of the system's power: a configuration panel, complete with
options for configuring and reordering your installed cards, loading the
virtual MIDI driver, selecting plugins for .asoundrc and generating a
new file, operating alsactl and so forth. ALSA is indeed feature-rich,
but too many of its excellent features are available only to those of
us willing to write scripts and resource files.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there is an abundance of ALSA documentation and information
for users of all levels. I already mentioned the man pages for the
ALSA utilities. The ALSA Web site includes many resources for basic and
advanced use of the system. Also,the alsa-user and alsa-devel mail lists are
founts of wisdom and assistance, as is the excellent ALSA Wiki.
</p><p>
The project always needs programmers, but it also needs graphics artists,
technical writers and beta testers, so even if you can't code, your
skills might still be valuable to the project. Donations of hardware
and cash also are cheerfully accepted; please see the ALSA Web site for
appropriate contact details.
</p><p>
The average user can expect to see more cards supported, with more
features available to the user. Hopefully, card configuration will become
easier: getting the most from ALSA can be a simple matter or it
can be a difficult thing. It is true that what is difficult is
not impossible, and the payoff certainly can be worth the effort.
Hopefully, though, we also will see some more accessible tools for user-level
configuration.
