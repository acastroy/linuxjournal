The last piece in the shared
calendar project is letting users push their calendars
up to the server. Here are two ways to do it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12e0580.0x13d83a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Over the last few months, we have explored the iCalendar standard and
the ways in which it allows us to create our own calendars, as well as
work with remote ones.
</p><p>
But if you think about it for a moment, you'll realize we are
missing a key piece of functionality. We have seen how easy it is to
create our own local calendars. We have seen how we can retrieve
remote calendars. We have even seen how we can create and distribute
remote calendars, generating events dynamically from a Web/database
application. But we have never considered how an individual Sunbird
user might be able to share his or her calendar with other people.
</p><p>
Anyone who has worked in even a medium-sized organization knows that
scheduling appointments can be difficult. Having access to everyone's
calendar, and being able to schedule meetings for them, is an
increasingly useful feature for our software to have. If every change I make
to my calendar is available for everyone to see, it will be
easier for them to schedule meetings when I will be around. (Or when
I won't be around, if they want to keep something secret from me.)
I used to ask clients why they use Microsoft Exchange as a mail
server, given the availability of excellent open-source alternatives;
inevitably, the answer would have more to do with the calendar support
in Outlook and Exchange, rather than the e-mail functionality.
</p><p>
This month, we close our exploration of Sunbird and iCalendar
with a look at how we can publish calendars to a central repository
for others to share. The results might not be as slick or smooth as
some of the commercial alternatives, but as with many other types of
software in the open-source world, I believe that this is rapidly
changing, and that we soon will see open-source calendar servers that
are equal or superior to their proprietary counterparts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12e0580.0x13d85b0"></a>
Sharing</h2></div></div><p>
Before we try to share a calendar, we should define exactly what we mean
by sharing. You might think that shared calendars are stored in a
single place and accessed by multiple calendar programs
simultaneously. Although it is theoretically possible to configure
Sunbird, or any other iCalendar-compatible program, such as Evolution,
in this way, this is not what we would typically expect.
</p><p>
Basically, a shared calendar in the iCalendar world is an iCalendar
file that is available for retrieval from a publicly accessible
server. That iCalendar file might be updated once per hour or once
per year; much like an RSS feed or a Weblog, there is no way to
know how often a particular calendar file might be updated. For this
reason, we need to make several assumptions: 1) everyone who is
interested in this particular calendar is subscribed to it; 2) every
subscriber downloads an updated version of the calendar on a regular
basis, at least once per day; and 3) the calendar's manager
publishes all changes and updates to the public server as soon as they
are made.
</p><p>
In other words, the sharing does not take place in real time at all,
but rather depends on all of the participating users to publish and
retrieve updates on a regular basis. Between updates, a calendar user
sees only the most recently downloaded iCalendar file, which is stored
on his or her local computer. If a calendar subscriber is scheduled
to retrieve updates only once per day, it is quite possible that
he or she will miss last-minute updates to the calendar. Just how
often someone should subscribe to calendar updates depends on the
nature of the organization, how important it is to get updates and
the load that might be placed on the server. After all, a server that
can provide daily updates to 100 people might have trouble providing
hourly updates to 10,000 people.

Storing with FTP</h2></div></div><p>
The easiest way to publish files on the Web is to use the old standby
for file transfer, FTP. FTP has gone
almost unused on my server for some time now, in no small part because
of security concerns, but if you are working on a system that is
properly secured, or if you would rather not use WebDAV (described
below), FTP is a workable and simple way to share Web calendars.
</p><p>
On my server, running ProFTPd, I decided to create a new user
(calendar) with a password (cal4atf). To ensure that this user
cannot be used for remote logins or other mischief, I would like to
give it a shell of /sbin/nologin, or perhaps /bin/false&mdash;both of
which are programs that simply exit, without giving a malicious user
any chance to log in and take advantage of my system. The
problem with this approach is that FTP servers allow only users whose
shell is in /etc/shells to log in. This presents us with something of
a dilemma. We want to give the calendar user a non-interactive
shell, but we also want the user to be able to use FTP. But, adding
/sbin/nlogin to /etc/shells might open a security hole on our system.
A simple solution is to copy /sbin/nologin to
/sbin/nologin-but-yesftp and to add a line in /etc/shells with the
latter shell's name.
</p><p>
Normally, non-anonymous users logging in via FTP are shown their own
home directories. By default, ProFTPd goes one step further than
this, forbidding users from going outside of their own home
directories. Thus, we can rest assured that even if a malicious user
gets a hold of our calendar user name and password, the worst that he
or she can do is destroy or modify our calendar files.
This is obviously not something we want to encourage, and in a
production environment, you undoubtedly would want better security&mdash;giving everyone a unique user name and password, for example. But for
this simple demonstration, we will forge ahead with our single
calendar user, knowing that a security breach might well take our
shared calendar files with it.
</p><p>
Assuming that we have configured FTP appropriately, how can we publish
our calendar? From within Sunbird, we select the calendar we want to
publish, which is called My Calendar by default. A menu pops
up, the last option of which says, Publish entire calendar. If you
select this option, a small dialog box opens, asking for the URL
to which you intend to publish the calendar.
</p><p>
It goes without saying that the URL will begin with ftp://, but what
comes after that? Assuming that the user name and password are as we
indicated above, and that the server is calendar.lerner.co.il, we
can access it as
ftp://calendar:cal4atf@calendar.lerner.co.il/calendar.ics.
</p><p>
As you can see, we separate the user name and password with colons, and
then put an @ sign between the password and the server name.
Following the server is the name of the file we want to save. Although
theoretically it
can have any name or suffix, the .ics suffix is
considered quite standard and ensures that all of the programs
involved will understand the MIME types.
</p><p>
Now, let's say I make a change to my calendar.
Must I now manually upload it to the server, going
through this same procedure again? No, there is
a way around this. Click on the calendar's name
to get the same menu that you have already seen.
Instead of selecting Publish entire calendar,
select Edit calendar. This opens
a dialog box that includes, among other things, a
text field into which you can enter a URL, as well
as a check box indicating that the calendar should
be published whenever a change is made. I had mixed
results using this functionality, although it worked
more often than not and did a good job of keeping
my appointments synchronized on different systems.
</p><p>
Subscribing to the shared calendar is similar to publishing it. Enter
the full URL, including user name and password, and any
iCalendar-compatible program should retrieve and display it. Of
course, the configuration that we have put in place requires that the
program can handle HTTP authentication.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12e0580.0x13d8ad8"></a>
mod_dav</h2></div></div><p>
FTP is fine for some tasks, but it has a number of drawbacks. To begin
with, you might not want to run an FTP server on your computer, given
its history of security problems. You also might prefer to have
everything run over HTTP for performance reasons or because you can
encrypt the transmission over SSL. For a variety of reasons, then,
you might want to consider another alternative: mod_dav.
</p><p>
DAV, or Distributed Authoring and Versioning, makes
it possible to create and modify files on a server,
rather than just retrieve and read them. That is,
DAV turns HTTP into a read-write protocol.
DAV has been around for a number of years
already, and mod_dav modules for Apache 1.x and 2.x
have existed for some time. I am still using Apache
1.x on my main server, but it should be equally easy
to install and use mod_dav for Apache 2.x.
</p><p>
To begin with, you need to download mod_dav
(see the on-line Resources). Because I had compiled Apache with
DSO (shared object) capabilities, I didn't have to
recompile it from scratch in order to incorporate
mod_dav. I merely had to tell it where to
find apxs, the automatically generated Perl program
that gives Apache modules all of the information
they need in order to compile without the Apache
source code. After unpacking the mod_dav source code,
I typed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --with-apxs=/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs
</pre>
</p><p>
Once done, I compiled and installed mod_dav:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make
make install
</pre>
</p><p>
I double-checked to make sure that my Apache configuration file,
httpd.conf, was still intact after the modifications provided by
<tt  >make
install</tt>. Following that, I configured Apache to include a new named
virtual server, which I called davcal.lerner.co.il:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;VirtualHost 69.55.225.93&gt;
ServerName davcal.lerner.co.il
ServerAdmin calendar@lerner.co.il

# Directory and file names not beginning with /
# are relative to ServerRoot
ServerRoot /usr/local/apache/v-sites/davcal.lerner.co.il

DocumentRoot www
ErrorLog logs/error-log
CustomLog logs/access-log combined
CustomLog logs/referer-log referer

DAVLockDB  DAVLock
  &lt;Directory
  /usr/local/apache/v-sites/davcal.lerner.co.il/www/&gt;
    DAV On
    &lt;Limit PUT POST DELETE PROPFIND PROPPATCH MKCOL
           COPY MOVE LOCK UNLOCK&gt;
      AuthName "Calendar DAV access"
      AuthType basic
      AuthUserFile passwd
      Require user calendar
    &lt;/Limit&gt;
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the DAV-specific directives in the above configuration section.
I have set up where the DAV locking will reside with DAVLockDB,
obviously outside of the HTTP-accessible DocumentRoot directory. I
then turn DAV on for a particular directory and limit DAV access to
the calendar user, with a password specified in an external file.
That password file, which is also outside of the Web site's root
directory, is created and updated with the standard htpasswd
program, located by default in /usr/local/apache/bin.
</p><p>
Finally, notice that our &lt;Limit&gt; section specifies limits only for
potentially dangerous requests. The standard HTTP GET request, by
contrast, requires no user name or password. This is a good
configuration if you want to let anyone subscribe to your calendar
but give limited access for publishing and modifying the calendar
file. If this calendar were going to be used in a business, you
probably would want to limit access to it as well, perhaps by giving each
user his or her own password.
</p><p>
We can publish this calendar by bringing up (once again) the Publish
entire calendar dialog for a particular calendar. This time, we
use an HTTP URL, without specifying a user name or password:
http://davcal.lerner.co.il/calendar.ics.
</p><p>
This publishes the calendar to the site, as you can tell by looking
at the appropriate directory on the server. You similarly can publish
the calendar using WebDAV each time the calendar is updated, just as
we saw before.
</p><p>
Finally, we can subscribe to this calendar using the same techniques
that we have seen in previous months. Choose Subscribe to remote
calendar from the File menu and enter the URL for this calendar
file. Thanks to the magic of WebDAV, we even can use the same URL for
writing and reading the file.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Although the open-source world might not have a fancy
back-end calendar system like Microsoft Exchange,
solutions exist that are more flexible and more than good enough for
most groups.
</p><p>
I should note that Sunbird does appear to have some
problems with publishing and subscribing; if nothing
else, meetings that were listed as private on my
Sunbird application continued to be marked in that way
when the file was uploaded&mdash;and were then displayed
as private when I subscribed to the calendar with a
different program. Moreover, Sunbird continues to be
slow when working with large calendars; however, that
problem has been noted by the Sunbird developers
and presumably will be fixed in the coming months.
</p><p>
There is also the promise of a new server for handling iCalendar
files in Novell's Hula Project. Since Novell acquired both Ximian and
SUSE, Hula is one of the most-hyped new
projects to emerge from that combination. If Hula does indeed include
iCalendar support, I will be curious to see how it improves on
the FTP and WebDAV solutions I have outlined above. Until then, there
are workable solutions that satisfy my own needs, as well as those of
many other small organizations looking to collaborate with each other.
