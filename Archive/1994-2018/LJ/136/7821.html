As Linux users, we're used to cracking open our cases
to modify our computers, but as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building the Perfect
PC</em></span> shows, this practice is no longer merely for techies.
In fact, many ordinary people are building PCs from scratch.
A grandmother that one of the authors met at a
big-box store was in the process of building her third PC&mdash;this time
for her granddaughter.
</p><p>
You may be comfortable hacking together a device
driver without having the specs available. But,
if you are like me, you might feel tentative
about plugging an expensive CPU in to a motherboard.
If so, then this book is for you.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Building the Perfect PC</em></span> has a larger-than-usual
format than other O'Reilly books. The larger size is due to the
margins being filled with photos illustrating the proper method for
putting together various components. So that's how the thermal compound
is applied!
</p><p>
The book cites many reasons why you would want to
build your own PC, including lower cost, broader
options, better component quality and no bundled
software. Most interesting to me, though, is the ability to build PCs for
specific purposes. Not only does this book teach readers how to
build mainstream PCs and SOHO servers, but there
are chapters on building &ldquo;Kick-Ass LAN Party PCs&rdquo; and
home theater PCs.
</p><p>
Each project is contained in a chapter that starts with a section called
&ldquo;Determining Functional Requirements and Hardware Design
Criteria&rdquo;. When it comes to component considerations,
the authors are not shy about recommending products
by brand name. They don't claim that their
recommendations are the only good choices, but they
want you to benefit from their experience and
research. After you're done designing your system,
you're ready to build. The bulk of the chapter then
guides you through building the system and offers many
photographs and helpful explanations for doing so.
</p><p>
The book doesn't have too many technical details
about configuring software, but that kind of
information is available elsewhere. At times the
chatty style of the authors seems a little more
suited to a magazine article than a book. But if you're
looking for a friendly guide to putting together
hardware, I recommend this book. If you read it, you soon will
be inspired to put together your own project, perhaps the home theater.
The results will be better, more flexible and less
expensive than any product you can buy ready made and off the shelf.
