Can't make it to a LinuxFest this year? Host your own!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f0580.0x27e82a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Every time I attend a Linux conference, I'm reminded of one thing: I'm
so glad I'm not in charge. I have a difficult time getting my family out
the door to go to school on time every morning. The thought of arranging
dozens of sessions, hundreds of volunteers and thousands of attendees is
just overwhelming. I've always been quite certain every conference has a
&ldquo;nervous-breakdown room&rdquo; where the people in charge go to rock back and
forth in a fetal position a few times a day.
</p><p>
Although that might be true for many people, as it would certainly be for me,
my opinion changed when I attended my first Southern California Linux Expo
(SCALE) a couple years ago. There certainly was plenty of chaos to be
had, but in the hallway outside the vendor area, I met Gareth Greenaway.
Gareth was casually talking to the group of us from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>,
sipping on a cup of coffee and wearing flip-flops. When I learned that
he was one of the people in charge of SCALE, I figured he already
had cracked and had just come from a fetal-ball-rocking session in the
nervous-breakdown room. As it turns out, he's just really good at what he does.
When we decided to do an issue on Community, I thought he would be the
perfect person to interview about running a Linux conference. Thankfully,
in his typically calm and casual way, he agreed.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> What is your job, specifically, when it comes to SCALE every year?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> Currently, I fill two roles within the SCALE organization. The
first role is Conference Operations. This role is the primary contact
between the venue and the SCALE &ldquo;team&rdquo;. In this capacity, I also
deal with several of the vendors that make the show happen, such as
the booth decorators.
</p><p>
The second role is that of Community Relations. This role is responsible
for working with the community to get the word out about the show,
working directly with the speakers' chairs to draw speaker submissions
from community groups and projects, and directing the Community Relations
committee's efforts to recruit dotORG exhibitors from the Free and Open
Source community.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> Given a one-year calendar, could you describe the milestones and
activities that take place to prepare for SCALE? If some things are
planned more than a year in advance, mention those as well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> The big milestones for the show include things like the dates for
the Call for Presentations, when the Call for Presentations should open and when it should
close. Other milestones are when attendee registration for the show
should open, and when the &ldquo;early-bird&rdquo; registration should end and the ticket
price should increase. We also have several milestones for behind-the-scenes
tasks, such as the various committees submitting their budgets
for the show, determining the placement of booths on the show floor,
signing various contracts and so on.
</p><p>
Planning for the show usually begins around May or June. Around
September is when we typically open up the Call for
Presentations. In December, we open up the registration system, with the
early-bird ticket prices going until around early January. The Call for
Presentations closes near the end of December or early January. Around
this time, things really get busy for most of the committees. [Note: the conference is usually scheduled to take place toward the end
of February each year.]
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> Most conferences charge an entry fee, accept sponsorships and get
money from vendors for having booths on-site. Without divulging specific
dollar amounts, what percentage of funding comes from what sources?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> Generally, a good portion of the funds that we need to host the show
comes from our generous sponsors. Several of them return each year
and have a regular presence on our show floor, and we greatly appreciate
their support. We end up providing various discounts for our attendees
to attend the show&mdash;these range from student discounts to discounts for
various user groups and open-source projects.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> What is the most expensive part of putting on a Linux conference?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> There are a few aspects that could easily qualify for the most
expensive part. The first is the show network, which is utilized by our
exhibit floor, our show registration system, our show wireless networks
and audio/video equipment used for monitoring talks. Each of these
areas, including each booth on the show floor, ends up being a separate
managed network. The downside is that providing this kind of network
infrastructure can be very expensive, while the upside is that SCALE
ends up with a rock-solid network.
</p><p>
The other aspect is our audio and visual equipment. We made the decision a
few years back to handle the audio and visual equipment ourselves, realizing
how expensive renting it directly from the venue can be. Luckily, we had
some very talented individuals step forward and fill the need. Although
we're handling this element ourselves, it still can end up being quite
an expense, especially with the number of speaker sessions that we need
to accommodate now. At the SCALE 9x Friday sessions, we had nine concurrent
sessions running, each room with its own full A/V setup.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> What is the most difficult aspect of
planning SCALE? And, what's the most
rewarding?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> For me, the most difficult aspect is
that the show lasts only a few
days. We plan things out for almost a full year, and it often feels like
it's over too quickly. 
</p><p>
A few years ago, I jokingly said that it reminded
me of a scene from one of my favorite movies, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Brewster's
Millions</em></span>. The
main character inherits millions of dollars and has to spend it all to
get his full inheritance. Shortly after he gets his first inheritance,
he has an interior designer design him an office, but it's never quite
right. He explains to her that he wants to walk in and say &ldquo;I want to
die in this office!&rdquo; Finally in one of the final scenes, after he's
spent all his money and has nothing, Brewster walks into the office and
exclaims &ldquo;I want to die in this office.&rdquo; Immediately after
that, all
the rented furniture is taken back and the office is torn down. This
is always how I feel when SCALE is being packed up.
</p><p>
There are a few aspects about organizing SCALE that I consider especially
rewarding. The first being the opportunity to help spread the word
about many of the free and open-source projects that aren't able to be as
vocal as some of the others. A few years ago, we invited the creators
of the QIMO Project to attend SCALE as a dotORG exhibitor, and they ended up
being one of the more-popular exhibitor booths during the show and gained
quite a bit of exposure because of being at SCALE. 
</p><p>
We've also given
quite a few people who have never spoken at a conference the opportunity
to speak. One of my favorite sessions that we've had at SCALE was a
session that took place during our Friday sessions a few years back. The
daughter of one of our volunteers, Larry Cafiero, and two daughters of
Fedora/Red Hat contributor Karsten Wade, gave a talk on what they liked
and disliked about free and open-source software. It was a great moment
as these three young girls were explaining to a room full of adults, many
of whom were developers, what the software should and shouldn't do.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> As someone who speaks at conferences, I
know I'm horrible at getting
talks submitted in time. I can't imagine I'm the only speaker with
that tendency. Do you find it difficult to arrange quality sessions in
a timely manner?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> We've put together a list of those speakers who are typically late,
and as the deadline gets closer we send our goon squads to their homes,
forcing them to go through the submission process! In all seriousness,
it can be difficult, and we've had to resort to extending the call for
papers a few times. Usually this works to our benefit though, as we see
a flood of submissions for really great talks. Unfortunately, the flood
of talks also leaves us with more talks than we can accommodate in the
main conference. Fortunately, many of those talks end up being great
candidates for the SCALE Friday sessions or the UpSCALE, our version
of Ignite.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> Who is your dream speaker, and why?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> I really have two answers to this one. An
obvious choice would be Linus Torvalds. I believe there is an unwritten rule
somewhere that your event really can't be considered a true open-source
event until you've had Linus speak. I'd imagine he's got a whole blessing he
does too, a big ceremony and probably a closing dance number as well.
</p><p>
My other dream speaker isn't anyone in particular but all the people who
don't think they have what it takes to speak at a conference. One of the
things I love seeing at events is an overflowing room for an unknown
speaker.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> What is the most stressful part of the planning process?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> The most stressful part is the last few weeks leading up to the
show&mdash;wondering if everything is going to come together and wondering
if anyone will show up. This is also when I start dreaming about all
the things that could possibly go wrong. Usually the scenarios end up
being pretty ridiculous though. One of those scenarios had the show
taking place on a farm, with speakers giving talks in a chicken coop.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> How many people are involved in putting on SCALE (not including
guest speakers)?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> There are roughly ten core members that work
on the show each year,
but that number is growing as more and more people get involved, which
is really great to see, because new members bring new ideas and make sure that the
show stays fresh and fun. It works very much like an open-source
project&mdash;someone will see a missing or existing element that needs to be added
or needs attention, then he or she jumps in. We've had several people start
off simply as volunteers during the show, who are not core members of
the team.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> How did SCALE start?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> Several years ago, I proposed to some members of the local Linux Users
Group that we host a one-day event, with the idea of it being a gathering
of the local LUGs in the area. We had speakers from the local LUGs
giving presentations on a variety of topics, and exhibitors included LUG
members showcasing their favorite open-source projects and a handful of
local commercial companies with Linux-based products. We called the
event LUGFest and ended up hosting the event four times, every six months.
</p><p>
While planning the fifth event, a member of one of the other local LUGs
told me that some students at University of Southern California and
University of California Los Angeles and members of the USCLUG and UCLALUG,
respectively, were looking into the possibility of hosting a conference on
the USC campus. I made contact with that team, and we ended up meeting,
then planning out the first SCALE event. The first show was held at
the Davidson conference center on the USC campus, and there were roughly 20
exhibitors and two speaker tracks.
</p><p>
Since then, we've hosted the show at various locations, expanded the
speaker track to five concurrent sessions, added specialty Friday sessions
and expanded the exhibitor floor to more than 100 exhibitor booths.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> You must be passionate about Linux to take
on
something like this.
What's your story?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span>
I actually got involved with free and open-source software while looking for a
job. I
was hunting for a job as a computer programmer and came across one that
sounded interesting. I ended up asking about their environment and was told
that they used UNIX. I had never heard of UNIX, so I started doing some
research and came across two free UNIXes, Linux and FreeBSD. I don't
remember exactly why, but I ended up going the Linux route, and I ended up
doing a Slackware install. After writing 40+ floppy disks, I had a Linux
machine. That definitely was a different time. I can vividly remember the first
time I set up an X graphical session&mdash;crouching under my desk, reaching up
to the keyboard to hit the Enter key, because I had read horror stories of
people blowing up their monitors. I wouldn't say I necessarily miss those
days, but I do think it's important to realize and appreciate how far things
have come.
</p><p>
Free and open-source software definitely has come a long way. It's given so
many people so many opportunities to use and work with a variety of
software that they otherwise wouldn't have had access to.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> How has the economy dip in recent years affected the turnout of both
guests and vendors?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> When the economy dipped a few years ago, we definitely saw that
reflected in many aspects of the show. For obvious reasons, many
sponsors and commercial exhibitors were more reluctant to fund the show
and have their employees host a booth. We saw fewer companies out at
the show recruiting versus other years as well. One aspect that remains
a constant, however, is our attendance. Many of us feared that with
the economy in the position it was that we would see a downturn in
the number of people who attended. While it didn't shoot up at all,
it certainly didn't plummet, which was a pleasant surprise.
</p><p>
In recent years, as a hopeful sign that the economy is heading back
to a more healthier place, we've seen an uptick in both sponsorship and
attendance. This past SCALE (SCALE 9x), we saw quite a jump in the
number of attendees that came out for the show as well as the number
of exhibitors.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span>
Many are wondering if there's a place for a major national show
again&mdash;a LinuxWorld circa 1998&mdash;or if the trend is toward regional
community-driven events like SCALE. What are your thoughts?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span>
I think the time for commercially driven events has passed, and now it's the
time for community events. That being said, I think having a governing
organization for national or international events could be an interesting
and important addition. The community events are so successful because of
the passion for the subject that the organizers bring to the table. There
definitely is a different dynamic when people work on something for a
paycheck vs. for the love of it. I'm not against people being paid for
their work on free and open-source software or events, but it shouldn't just
be about the paycheck.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> How do you arrange the session schedule? Is it your fault when two
sessions I want to go to occur at the same time? That said, is there
a certain methodology or software that helps arrange tracks to minimize
topic overlap?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> We do our best to arrange the talks in a
way that two talks 
we think will be popular don't overlap. Unfortunately, we're not always
right. We've definitely had some talks that were wildly popular, with
attendees spilling out into the hallways and sitting in the aisles. That
being said, it's absolutely my fault when there are two sessions that
you want to go to occur at the same time.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> Share some experiences or details that would be surprising
for those not familiar with planning and running a Linux conference.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> One thing that always surprises everyone about SCALE is that everyone
involved is a volunteer; no one is paid to work on the show.
</p><p>
Advice I would give to others wanting to plan a similar event would be to
start small and definitely not try to do everything yourself. When
dealing with vendors and any venues, make sure to get everything in
writing. And, if you're holding an event at a hotel, be sure to account
for the 20% service charge that gets charged to everything!
</p><p>
One of the most interesting experiences that I've had planning SCALE
was the year the show ended up being the same weekend that a certain
awards show takes place in Southern California. Before the show
began, while hunting around the venue for a missing package for one of
sponsors, I ended up in the room where the awards show tickets were being
stored. Following the show, buildings surrounding the venue were topped
with snipers as a form of security for the awards show.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> What advice can you give to someone
who is (or readers who are?)
considering starting a regional event themselves?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>GG:</b></span> Start small, don't try to do too much the first year.
</p><p>
Make sure roles and responsibilities are well defined and well
communicated. Nothing is worse than having too many cooks in the kitchen all
trying to do the same thing.
</p><p>
Take chances, and allow others to make mistakes. The event doesn't need to
be absolutely perfect, and it won't be.
</p><p>
Don't take things personally. People are going to complain; it's just a fact
of life. Be polite, and listen to what they have to say. There likely
will be
some useful information in the complaints.
</p><p>
Open communication is key. It definitely should be a team effort.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SP:</b></span> As always, Gareth, speaking with you was great.
Thanks for taking the time to talk to us. And, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>
readers,
if you've ever considered
starting a community event, I'd highly recommend attending
one of the regional events in your area. Talk to the people who make
conferences happen; they even might be willing to give you some advice.
And, if you're ever in Southern California in late February, be sure to
come to SCALE! Tell Gareth we sent you. If you're planning to speak at or
attend a Linux event in the future, see the sidebars to this article for some
tips from myself and editors Kyle Rankin and Bill Childers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f0580.0x2be27b0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Linux Presenter Tips</b></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
People like to look at pictures and listen to speakers. I
try to keep my PowerPoint presentations simple and with few words. Not
everyone presents that way, but it works for me.
</p></li><li><p>
Be excited about your topic, even if you're not. I just gave a
very lively and exciting talk at Penguicon about backups, pretty much
the most boring topic on the planet.
</p></li><li><p>
Give 110% to your audience, whether it's 2,000 people or two people.
They came to see you, likely at great expense; give them the respect
they deserve.
</p></li><li><p>
Leave some time for questions if possible.
</p></li><li><p>
Leave the room when your time slot is over. If there is a crowd,
lead them into the hallway to be respectful of the next speaker.
</p></li><li><p>
Make bullet points short, and elaborate on them when you talk. If you
just read your bullet points to the crowd, the crowd can (and will) do it
without you. This needs to be bold, highlighted and repeated. Your talk
elaborates your bullet points. If you simply read the presentation, it makes
for a horribly boring session.
</p></li><li><p>
Don't be arrogant. Your audience is full of your peers, not your
students. Always assume there are people in the audience who know more
about the topic than you do (there usually are).
</p></li><li><p>
It's important to take questions from the audience, but don't let the
questions
(or one audience member) dominate the talk. If questions start to get out
of hand, tell the audience you'll take further questions at the end or
after the talk.
</p></li><li><p>
Fact-check your presentation. Geeks <span   class="emphasis"><em>love</em></span> to correct a
presenter, so be
careful with generalizations and look for places in your talk where you
might be inaccurate. Make sure any sources you use are authoritative and up
to date.
</p></li><li><p>
Avoid demos unless absolutely necessary. Screenshots, screen-scrape
videos and example commands usually can make your point and are less
likely to break in the middle of your talk. Nothing's worse for a
presenter's reputation or an audience's patience than a broken demo. If you
must use a demo, test it thoroughly and have a backup plan in case it fails.
Preparing for things to go completely wrong is something that
you <span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> to do. I gave a talk on virtualization at Penguicon a couple years
ago. I prepared for the talk and ran through the demo at least four times.
But on the day of the presentation, the virtual networking I needed for the
talk failed to run. I played it off, spent a couple minutes getting
comments and tips from the peanut gallery in the crowd on how to troubleshoot
it, but then abandoned it, and just went off to talk about what was left in
the slide. The talk wasn't as good as I'd hoped, and it wasn't what people
came to see, but I think it wasn't a total wreck either, simply because I had
enough material and was prepared in the event that it went sideways.
</p></li><li><p>
Practice your talk at a LUG. Linux Users Groups usually are quite
grateful to have speakers and are a great place to practice your talk in
front of a similar audience before the &ldquo;main event&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Try not to take yourself too seriously. There will be
mistakes, flubs and people doing silly stuff during your talk. Be ready to
blow off mistakes or joke about them. You can turn a bad moment into
something that will make the crowd laugh. They won't remember the flub, and
you come off as very entertaining.
</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26f0580.0x2be3308"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Tips for Attending a Linux Event</b></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Always plan a backup talk to attend. Sometimes a talk's summary is written months
before the presentation, and often presenters will completely rework a talk.
Other times, the talk just isn't what you were expecting. Usually you can
tell in the first five minutes whether a talk is worth the time, and if you
already have a backup talk planned, you'll be able to get there before you
miss too much of it.
</p></li><li><p>
Attend the &ldquo;hallway track&rdquo;. Some of the most rewarding time you'll spend
at a conference is the hallway track or the conversations you have with
geeks in the hallway outside formal talks. It's definitely worth it to
get over any social anxiety and strike up a conversation with fellow geeks
to find out what cool things other people are up to.
</p></li><li><p>
All things being equal, choose an expert. Sometimes you'll have a few
different talks you want to attend at the same time. If it's difficult to
decide, add extra points if one of the talks is being given by either a
known good presenter or the absolute expert on the topic.
</p></li><li><p>
Don't be &ldquo;that guy&rdquo;. There's always the person in the audience
who
wants to prove he or she is smarter than the presenter and tries to dominate
the talk. You'll get better answers and a better presentation from the
presenters if you actually let them present. If you have detailed questions,
most presenters are more than happy to field questions after the talk is
over. 
</p></li><li><p>
Always throw in at least one &ldquo;wild card&rdquo;. It's easy if you are a
programmer to stay in the developer track, or if you are a sysadmin to
stay in the sysadmin track&mdash;after all, that's why tracks were invented. Be
open to mixing it up though, and choose at least one wild-card talk in a
subject you may have only indirect interest in. 
</p></li><li><p>
Silence your phone. This goes for your computer too. It's really
distracting for everyone to hear that Ubuntu startup sound, a ringtone or
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Angry Birds</em></span> noises in the middle of a talk.
</p></li><li><p>
Get your schedule figured out, and plan which talks you want to go to. If
you have a smartphone or PDA, put them in your calendar, along with what room
they're in. That way, you're not scrambling trying to figure out where you need
to be and when.
</p></li><li><p>
If you're on social media, find the event's hashtag and Tweet/Facebook-post with
the hashtag. Also, search for that hashtag. You'll wind up finding
lots of sidebar events and meeting a whole bunch more folks that way. It's the
&ldquo;hallway track&rdquo;, but virtualized.
</p></li><li><p>
If it's a multi-day event, bring half the clothes and twice the money.
Hotel food is expensive, and drink is doubly so.
</p></li><li><p>
Pack a power strip.
</p></li><li><p>
Be ready to have a <span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of fun.
