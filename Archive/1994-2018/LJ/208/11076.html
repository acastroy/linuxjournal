<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #208, August 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
This edition of diff -u is dedicated to <span   class="bold"><b>David
Brownell</b></span>, a kernel
hacker who gave a lot his time and creativity to Linux, and a lot of
help and encouragement to many open-source developers. Rest in peace,
David. May your name linger long in the source tree.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pekka Enberg</b></span> has been working on a helpful
<span   class="bold"><b>virtualization tool</b></span> to
make it relatively straightforward to boot a virtual system on a
running Linux box. There are various virtualization tools available,
but Pekka says this one is intended to be a clean, lightweight
alternative that anyone could use.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Tony Ibbs</b></span> has released <span   class="bold"><b>KBUS</b></span>, available at <a href="http://kbus-messaging.org" target="_self">kbus-messaging.org</a>.
It's a message-passing framework, intended to support software running
on embedded systems. The main idea is that it will be very reliable: a process that dies before it can send a needed message still
will have a message sent by KBUS on its behalf; messages flying through the
system will all arrive in a predictable order, making their
significance easier to interpret; and messages that are sent by one
process are as nearly as possible guaranteed to arrive at their
destination.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dan Rosenberg</b></span> kicked off a new drive to increase Linux security, when
he posted some patches to hide the <span   class="bold"><b>/proc/slabinfo</b></span> file from regular
users. It turned out that his approach was too much of a blunt
instrument, with too little gain, for certain folks' taste. But in the
process of debating its various merits, a bunch of folks, including
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>, dove into the memory allocation code, trying to figure
out ways of preventing various security exploits that had been seen in
the recent past.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>David Johnston</b></span> alerted the kernel folks to the idea that some of his
code had been included in the kernel, without attributing him as the
author and without having been licensed by him to be included in the
source tree. It appeared to be a clear <span   class="bold"><b>copyright
violation</b></span>. David
actually said he'd be pleased and honored to have his code in the
kernel; he just wanted to make sure the attribution was correct, and
the license issues sorted out. So a few folks worked on finding out
how the code had gotten into the kernel in the first place and how to
fix the attribution. These kinds of debates always are fascinating,
because they put everyone in the awkward position of already
having done something wrong and trying to figure out the best legal and
ethical way to back out of it again.
</p><p>
A bit of political wrangling: <span   class="bold"><b>David Brown</b></span> tried
to remove <span   class="bold"><b>Daniel
Walker</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Bryan Huntsman</b></span> from the
<span   class="bold"><b>MAINTAINERS file</b></span>, as the official
maintainers of <span   class="bold"><b>ARM/Qualcomm MSM</b></span> machine support. Bryan was fine with
this, but Daniel had not given his approval. It turned out that Bryan
and David were both industry folks, and Daniel wanted to remain a
maintainer, partly in order to make sure they &ldquo;did right by the
community&rdquo;. As Linus Torvalds pointed out during the discussion, there
was no real reason for any good maintainers to be supplanted if they
didn't want to step down. Their contribution could be only positive,
and so the argument by the industry folks amounted to an exclusivity
that Linus said he found distasteful. And as <span   class="bold"><b>Pavel
Machek</b></span> pointed out,
the fact that David had thought it would be okay to do this in the first
place was a good enough argument that he wasn't yet ready to be a
sole maintainer.

If you are an Ubuntu user and a fan of the new Unity interface,
you might be interested in a new lens in development by David Call&eacute;.
The Books Lens provides a real-time search interface for e-books.
It currently interfaces with Google Books, Project Gutenberg and
Forgotten Books. By the time you read this, that list probably
will have grown.
</p><p>
The Books Lens instantly finds metadata on your search, including book
covers, and gives you direct links to the books themselves. For us
book nerds, it's quite a handy little tool. Check it out yourself at
<a href="https://launchpad.net/unity-books-lens" target="_self">https://launchpad.net/unity-books-lens</a>, or install the PPA with:

One of the things that frustrates me about GNOME is the lack of wallpaper
rotation integration. Thankfully, several tools are available to remedy
that shortcoming. My current favorite solution is DesktopNova by
Stefan Haller. DesktopNova not only lets you add multiple folders to
your wallpaper rotation group, it also optionally allows you to show a
tray icon to interact with it.
</p><p>
DesktopNova comes precompiled for several distributions, and it already may be in
your repository. When combined with the hundreds of space photos
I've downloaded from NASA, DesktopNova makes my computing experience
out of this world! (Yes, I think that counts as the cheesiest thing I've
written all year.)

Most people are familiar with Thunderbird. In fact, I used its predecessor
back when it was just a part of the Netscape Communicator suite.
Thunderbird has come a long way in recent months, however, and it's still
being developed very actively. If you haven't checked out some of its
new features, now might be the time to do so. Thunderbird supports Gmail-style
archiving, tabs and better searching, and it's completely extensible with
add-ons.
</p><p>
Oh, and if you're stuck with Windows or OS X, no problem! Thunderbird 
always has been a cross-platform e-mail solution, and it still is.
It makes the transition from one platform to another easier for users,
and if you don't like your e-mail to be kept on some Web company's
servers, it might be the ideal e-mail solution for you. Check it out

<h2 class="title">To CFD, or Not to CFD?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #208, August 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One area that chews up a lot of cycles on machines around the world is
CFD. What is CFD? CFD is short for Computational Fluid Dynamics. The
general idea is to model the flow of gases and liquids (or fluids) as
they interact with solid surfaces. This type of modeling is used in
designing aircraft, automobiles, submarines and fan blades&mdash;basically,
anything that travels through water or air. As you increase the complexity
of the surfaces, or increase the complexity of the flow (such as going
from subsonic to supersonic), the amount of computer time needed to model
it goes up. One of the big packages available to do CFD is the suite of
programs made by Ansys. Several groups here at my university use it. But,
there is an open-source option available, OpenFOAM (<a href="http://www.openfoam.com" target="_self">www.openfoam.com</a>). This month, I describe
what you can accomplish with OpenFOAM. The OpenFOAM Project includes
binary packages as deb files or RPM files. You also can download a source
code package of files or even download directly from the Git repository.
</p><p>
OpenFOAM (Open Source Field Operation and Manipulation) basically is a set
of C++ libraries that are used in the various processing steps. OpenFOAM,
just like most other CFD packages, breaks down the work to be done
into three separate steps. The first step is called pre-processing. In
pre-processing, you define the problem you are trying to model. This
involves defining the boundary conditions given by the solid objects in
your model. You also describe the characteristics of the fluid you are
trying to model, including viscosity, density and any other properties
that are important for your model. The next step is called the solver
step. This is where you actually solve the equations that describe your
model. The third step is called post-processing. This is where you take a
look at the results and visualize them so that you can see what happens
in your model. An obvious consequence of this breakdown is that most of
the computational work takes place during the solver phase. The pre- and
post-processing steps usually can be done on a desktop, while the solver
step easily can use up 50 or 100 processors. OpenFOAM includes several
pre- and post-processing utilities, along with several solvers. But the
real power comes from the fact that, because OpenFOAM is library-based,
you can build your own utilities or solvers by using OpenFOAM as a
base. This is very useful in a research environment where you may be
trying something no one else ever has.
</p><p>
A model in OpenFOAM is called a case. Cases are stored as a set of
files within a case directory. Many other CFD packages use a single file
instead. A directory allows you to separate the data from the control
parameters from the properties. Case files can be edited using any
text editor, such as emacs or vi. Pre-processing involves creating all
of the files required for the case you are investigating. 
</p><p>
The first step
is mesh generation. Your fluid (be it a liquid or a gas) is broken down
into a collection of discrete cells, called a mesh. OpenFOAM includes a
number of utilities that will generate a mesh based on a description of
the geometry of your fluid. For example, the
<tt  >blockMesh</tt> utility generates
simple meshes of blocks, and the <tt  >snappyHexMesh</tt> utility generates complex
meshes of hexahedral or split-hexahedral cells. If you want to generate
a basic block mesh, you would lay out the details in a dictionary file,
called blockMeshDict, in the subdirectory constant/polyMesh within
your case subdirectory. The file starts with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
FoamFile
{
   version     2.0;
   format      ascii;
   class       dictionary;
   object      blockMeshDict;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Case files, in general, start with a header of this format, describing
what each case file consists of. In this particular file, you can define
sections containing vertices, blocks, edges or patches. Once you have
created this file, you can run the <tt  >blockMesh</tt> utility to process this
dictionary file and generate the actual mesh data that will be used in
the computation. 
</p><p>
The next step is to set your initial conditions. This is
done by creating a subdirectory called 0 and placing the relevant case
files here. These case files would contain the initial values and boundary
conditions for the fields of interest. For example, if you were looking at a fluid
flowing through a cavity, you may be interested in the pressure and
velocity. So, you would have two files in the 0 subdirectory describing
these two fields. You also need to set any important physical properties
in files stored in the Dictionaries subdirectory. These files end with
Properties. This is where you would define items like viscosity. The
last step in pre-processing is to set up the control file. This file is
named controlDict and is located in the system subdirectory. As an
example, let's say you wanted to start at t=0, run for 10 seconds with a
timestep of 0.1 seconds. This section of the control file would look like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
startFrom     startTime;
startTime     0;
stopAt        stopTime;
stopTime      10;
deltaT        0.1;
</pre>
</p><p>
You also set output parameters in this control file. You can set how
often OpenFOAM writes output with the writeControl keyword. So, let's say
you want to write out the results every 10 timesteps. That section of
the control file would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
writeControl        timeStep;
writeInterval       10
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells OpenFOAM to write out results every 10 timesteps into
separate subdirectories for each write. These subdirectories would
be labeled with the timestep. 
</p><p>
You also can set the file format,
the precision of results and file compression, among many other
options. 
</p><p>
Before you actually start the solver step, it probably is a
good idea to check the mesh to be sure that it looks right. There is a
post-processing tool called paraFoam that you can use. If you are
in your case directory, calling <tt  >paraFoam</tt> will load it up. Or, you
can specify another directory location with the command-line argument
<tt  >-case xxx</tt>, where xxx is the case directory you are interested in.
</p><p>
The next step is to run a solver on your model and see what you
get. Solvers tend to be specialized, in order to solve one particular
class of problem efficiently. So OpenFOAM comes with a rather large set
of standard solvers out of the box. If you are interested in solving a
laminar flow problem for an incompressible fluid, you likely would use
<tt  >icoFoam</tt>. Or, if you are interested in looking at cavitation, you could
use <tt  >cavitatingFoam</tt>. Or, you may want a solver for internal combustion
engines (<tt  >engineFoam</tt>). Take a look at the
documentation to see what
is available. Once you know which solver you are going to use, you can
run it by simply executing the relevant binary from within your case
directory, or you can use the <tt  >-case</tt> command-line argument to point to
another case directory.
</p><p>
The last step is the post-processing step, where you actually look at
the results and see what happened inside your model. Here, you can use
the supplied utility <tt  >paraFoam</tt>. It can accept a
<tt  >-case</tt> command-line
argument, just like all of the other utilities I've discussed. You 
then can manipulate the data and look at various time slices. You can generate
isosurface and contour plots, vector plots or streamline plots. You 
even can create animations, although not directly. You can make paraFoam 
output image files representing movie frames. So they would be saved
with filenames of the form:

<pre     class="programlisting">
fileroot_imagenum.fileext
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you can take this sequence of images and run them through something
like the <tt  >convert</tt> utility from ImageMagick to bundle them together into
a single movie file.
</p><p>
As a final comment, in both the pre- and post-processing steps, there
are utilities that allow you to convert to and from file formats used
by other CFD packages, including fluent, CFX and gambit, just to name a
few. This comes in handy if you are collaborating with other people who
happen to be using one of these other packages. If you are working with
someone who is using fluent, you would use
<tt  >fluentMeshToFoam</tt> in your
pre-processing step and <tt  >foamMeshToFluent</tt> in your post-processing step.
</p><p>
This short article provides only a small taste
of OpenFOAM. If you are interested in fluid dynamics, you 
definitely should take a look at OpenFOAM. The home page includes links to
great documentation and several tutorials. The installation package also
includes several example cases, so you can see how standard problem sets
are handled. You usually can use one of these examples as a jumping-off
point for your own problem. Check it out and see if it can help
you in your work.

<h2 class="title">XBMC, Now with Less XB!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #208, August 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Xbox Media Center (XBMC) is one of those projects whose name makes less
and less sense as time goes on. Sure, people still are using XBMC
on an actual Microsoft Xbox, but for the most part, XBMC now is run on
computers. In fact, recent versions of XBMC installed on an ION-based
nettop makes just about the perfect media center. Version 10 (Dharma)
introduced a fancy plugin system that allows XBMC to be extended beyond
its built-in media-playing abilities. The next version, currently in
development, will focus partially on recording as well as playback.
</p><p>
When it comes to performance, it's hard to beat XBMC. It's faster
and more responsive than a Boxee Box, has local media playback unlike
the Roku, and is open source, unlike Microsoft's media center options.
It does currently lack in premium on-line streaming, but that's largely
because the live version is based on Linux. It's a trade-off I'm willing
to make. (I actually keep a Roku for that purpose and use XBMC for
everything else.)
