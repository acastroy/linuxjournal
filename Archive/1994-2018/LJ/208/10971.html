In 2005, after just two weeks, Linus Torvalds completed the first version
of Git, an open-source version control system. Unlike typical centralized
systems, Git is based on a distributed model. It is extremely flexible and
guarantees data integrity while being powerful, fast and efficient. With
widespread and growing rates of adoption, and the increasing popularity
of services like GitHub, many consider Git to be the best version control
tool ever created.
</p><p>
Surprisingly, Linus had little interest in writing a version control tool
before this endeavor. He created Git out of necessity and frustration. The
Linux Kernel Project needed an open-source tool to manage
its massively distributed development effectively, and no existing tools were up to
the task.
</p><p>
Many aspects of Git's design are radical departures from the approach
of tools like CVS and Subversion, and they even differ significantly from
more modern tools like Mercurial. This is one of the reasons Git
is intimidating to many prospective users. But, if you throw away your
assumptions of how version control should work, you'll find that Git is
actually simpler than most systems, but capable of more.
</p><p>
In this article, I cover some of the fundamentals of how Git works and
stores data before moving on to discuss basic usage and work flow. I
found that knowing what is going on behind the scenes makes it much
easier to understand Git's many features and capabilities. Certain parts
of Git that I previously had found complicated suddenly were easy and
straightforward after spending a little time learning how it worked.
</p><p>
I find Git's design to be fascinating in and of itself. I peered behind
the curtain, expecting to find a massively complex machine, and instead saw
only a little hamster running in a wheel. Then I realized 
a complicated design not only wasn't needed, but also wouldn't add
any value.

Git Object Repository</h2></div></div><p>
Git, at its core, is a simple indexed name/value database. It stores
pieces of data (values) in &ldquo;objects&rdquo; with unique names. But, it does this
somewhat differently from most systems. Git operates on the principle of
&ldquo;content-addressed storage&rdquo;, which means the names are derived from the
values. An object's name is chosen automatically by its content's SHA1
checksum&mdash;a 40-character string like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2
</pre>
</p><p>
SHA1 is cryptographically strong, which guarantees a different checksum for
different data (the actual risk of two different pieces of data sharing
the same SHA1 checksum is infinitesimally small). The same chunk of data
always will have the same SHA1 checksum, which always will identify only
that chunk of data. Because object names are SHA1 checksums, they identify
the object's content while being truly globally unique&mdash;not just to one
repository, but to all repositories everywhere, forever.
</p><p>
To put this into perspective, the example SHA1 listed above happens to be
the ID of the first commit of the Linux kernel into a Git repository by
Linus Torvalds in 2005 (2.6.12-rc2). This is a lot more useful than some
arbitrary revision number with no real meaning. Nothing except that commit
ever will have the same ID, and you can use those 40 characters to verify
the data in every file throughout that version of Linux. Pretty cool, huh?
</p><p>
Git stores all the data for a repository in four types of objects: blobs,
trees, commits and tags. They are all just objects with an SHA1 name and
some content. The only difference between them is the type of information
they contain.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x1212930"></a>
Blobs and Trees</h2></div></div><p>
A blob stores the raw data content of a file. This is the simplest of
the four object types.
</p><p>
A tree stores the contents of a directory. This is a flat list of
file/directory names, each with a corresponding SHA1 representing
its content. These SHA1s are the names of other objects in the
repository. This referencing technique is used throughout Git to link all
kinds of information together. For file entries, the referenced object
is a blob. For directory entries, the referenced object is a tree that
can contain more directory entries, in turn referencing more trees to
define a complete and potentially unlimited hierarchy.
</p><p>
It's important to recognize that blobs and trees are not themselves
files and directories; they are just the contents of files and
directories. They don't know about anything outside their own content,
including the existence of any references in other objects that point
to them. References are one-way only.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10971f1.large.jpg"><img src="10971f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. An example directory structure and how it might be
stored in Git as tree and blob objects (I truncated the SHA1 names to
six characters for readability).
</p></div></div><p>
In the example shown in Figure 1, I'm assuming that the files MyApp.pm and MyApp1.pm
have the same contents, and so by definition, they must reference
the same blob object. This behavior is implicit in Git because of its
content-addressable design and works equally well for directories with
the same content.
</p><p>
As you can see, directory structures are defined by chains of references
stored in trees. A tree is able to represent all of the data in the files
and directories under it even though it contains only one level of names
and references. Because SHA1s of the referenced objects are within its
content, a tree's SHA1 exactly identifies and verifies the data throughout
the structure; a checksum resulting from a series of checksums verifies
all the underlying data regardless of the number of levels.
</p><p>
Consider storing a change to the file README illustrated in Figure
1. When committed, this would create a new blob (with a new SHA1),
which would require a new tree to represent &ldquo;foo&rdquo; (with a new
SHA1),
which would require a new tree for the top directory (with a new SHA1).
</p><p>
While creating three new objects to store one change might seem inefficient,
keep in mind that aside from the critical path of tree objects from
changed file to root, every other object in the hierarchy remains
identical. If you have a gigantic hierarchy of 10,000 files and you
change the text of one file ten directories deep, 11 new objects allow
you to describe both the old and the new state of the tree.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x1212e58"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
One potential problem of the content-addressed design is that two large
files with minor differences must be stored as different objects. However,
Git optimizes these cases by using deltas to eliminate duplicate data
between objects wherever possible. The size-reduced data is stored
in a highly efficient manner in &ldquo;pack files&rdquo;, which also are further
compressed. This operates transparently underneath the object repository
layer.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x12130c0"></a>
Commits</h2></div></div><p>
A commit is meant to record a set of changes introduced to a project.
What it really does is associate a tree object&mdash;representing a complete
snapshot of a directory structure at a moment in time&mdash;with contextual
information about it, such as who made the change and when, a description,
and its parent commit(s).
</p><p>
A commit doesn't actually store a list of changes (a &ldquo;diff&rdquo;)
directly, but
it doesn't need to. What changed can be calculated on-demand by
comparing the current commit's tree to that of its parent. Comparing
two trees is a lightweight operation, so there is no need to store this
information. Because there actually is nothing special about the parent
commit other than chronology, one commit can be compared to any other
just as easily regardless of how many commits are in between.
</p><p>
All commits should have a parent except the first one. Commits usually
have a single parent, but they will have more if they are the result of a
merge (I explain branching and merging 
later in this article). A commit from a merge still is just a snapshot in time like
any other, but its history has more than one lineage.
</p><p>
By following the chain of parent references backward from the current
commit, the entire history of a project can be reconstructed and browsed
all the way back to the first commit.
</p><p>
A commit is expanded recursively into a project history in exactly the
same manner as a tree is expanded into a directory structure. More
important, just as the SHA1 of a tree is a fingerprint of all the
data in all the trees and blobs below it, the SHA1 of a commit is a
fingerprint of all the data in its tree, as well as all of the data in
all the commits that preceded it.
</p><p>
This happens automatically because references are part of an object's
overall content. The SHA1 of each object is computed, in part, from the
SHA1s of any objects it references, which in turn were computed from the
SHA1s they referenced and so on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x12133d8"></a>
Tags</h2></div></div><p>
A tag is just a named reference to an object&mdash;usually a commit. Tags
typically are used to associate a particular version number with a
commit. The 40-character SHA1 names are many things, but human-friendly
isn't one of them. Tags solve this problem by letting you give an object
an additional name.
</p><p>
There are two types of tags: object tags and lightweight tags. Lightweight
tags are not objects in the repository, but instead are simple refs like branches,
except that they don't change. (I explain branches in more detail in the
Branching and Merging section below.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x1213538"></a>
Setting Up Git</h2></div></div><p>
If you don't already have Git on your system, install it with your
package manager. Because Git is primarily a simple command-line tool,
installing it is quick and easy under any modern distro.
</p><p>
You'll want to set the name and e-mail address that will be recorded in
new commits:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email john@example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
This just sets these parameters in the config file ~/.gitconfig. The
config has a simple syntax and could be edited by hand just as easily.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x1213748"></a>
User Interface</h2></div></div><p>
Git's interface consists of the &ldquo;working copy&rdquo; (the files you directly
interact with when working on the project), a local repository stored in
a hidden .git subdirectory at the root of the working copy, and commands
to move data back and forth between them, or between remote repositories.
</p><p>
The advantages of this design are many, but right away you'll notice that
there aren't pesky version control files scattered throughout the working
copy, and that you can work off-line without any loss of features. In fact,
Git doesn't have any concept of a central authority, so you always
are &ldquo;working off-line&rdquo; unless you specifically ask Git to exchange commits
with your peers.
</p><p>
The repository is made up of files that are manipulated by invoking
the git command from within the working copy. There is no special server
process or extra overhead, and you can have as many repositories on your
system as you like.
</p><p>
You can turn any directory into a working copy/repository just by running
this command from within it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git init
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, add all the files within the working copy to be tracked and
commit them:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git add .
git commit -m "My first commit"
</pre>
</p><p>
You can commit additional changes as frequently or infrequently as you
like by calling <tt  >git add</tt> followed by <tt  >git
commit</tt> after each modification
you want to record.
</p><p>
If you're new to Git, you may be wondering why you need to call <tt  >git
add</tt> each time. It has to do with the process of
&ldquo;staging&rdquo; a set of
changes before committing them, and it's one of the most common sources of
confusion. When you call <tt  >git add</tt> on one or more files, they are added
to the Index. The files in the Index&mdash;not the working copy&mdash;are what
get committed when you call <tt  >git commit</tt>.
</p><p>
Think of the Index as what will become the next commit. It simply provides
an extra layer of granularity and control in the commit process. It
allows you to commit some of the differences in your working copy,
but not others, which is useful in many situations.
</p><p>
You don't have to take advantage of the Index if you don't want to, and
you're not doing anything &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; if you don't. If you want to pretend
it doesn't exist, just remember to call <tt  >git add .</tt> from the root of
the working copy (which will update the Index to match) each time and
immediately before <tt  >git commit</tt>. You also can use the -a option with
<tt  >git commit</tt> to add changes automatically; however, it will not add new
files, only changes to existing files. Running <tt  >git add
.</tt> always
will add everything.
</p><p>
The exact work flow and specific style of commands largely are left up
to you as long as you follow the basic rules.
</p><p>
The <tt  >git status</tt> command shows you all the differences between your
working copy and the Index, and the Index and the most recent commit
(the current HEAD):

<pre     class="programlisting">
git status
</pre>
</p><p>
This lets you see pending changes easily at any given time, and it even
reminds you of relevant commands like <tt  >git add</tt> to stage pending changes
into the Index, or <tt  >git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;</tt> to remove (unstage) changes
that were added previously.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x160c548"></a>
Branching and Merging</h2></div></div><p>
The work you do in Git is specific to the current branch. A branch is
simply a moving reference to a commit (SHA1 object name). Every time
you create a new commit, the reference is updated to point to it&mdash;this
is how Git knows where to find the most recent commit, which is also
known as the tip, or head, of the branch.
</p><p>
By default, there is only one branch (&ldquo;master&rdquo;), but you can have as many
as you want. You create branches with <tt  >git branch</tt> and switch between
them with <tt  >git checkout</tt>. This may seem odd at first, but the reason
it's called &ldquo;checkout&rdquo; is that you are &ldquo;checking
out&rdquo; the head of that
branch into your working copy. This alters the files in your working
copy to match the commit at the head of the branch.
</p><p>
Branches are super-fast and easy, and they're a great way to try out new ideas,
even for trivial things. If you are used to other systems like CVS/SVN,
you might have negative thoughts associated with branches&mdash;forget all
that. Branching and merging are free in Git and can be used without a
second thought.
</p><p>
Run the following commands to create and switch to a new local branch
named &ldquo;myidea&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git branch myidea
git checkout myidea
</pre>
</p><p>
All commits now will be tracked in the new branch until you switch to
another. You can work on more than one branch at a time by switching
back and forth between them with <tt  >git checkout</tt>.
</p><p>
Branches are really useful only because they can be merged back together
later. If you decide that you like the changes in myidea, you can merge
them back into master:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git checkout master
git merge myidea
</pre>
</p><p>
Unless there are conflicts, this operation will merge all the changes
from myidea into your working copy and automatically commit the result to
master in one fell swoop. The new commit will have the previous commits
from both myidea and master listed as parents.
</p><p>
However, if there are conflicts&mdash;places where the same part of a file
was changed differently in each branch&mdash;Git will warn you and update
the affected files with &ldquo;conflict markers&rdquo; and not commit
the merge automatically. When this happens, it's up to you to edit the files by hand,
make decisions between the versions from each branch, and then remove the
conflict markers. To complete the merge, use <tt  >git add</tt> on each formerly
conflicted file, and then <tt  >git commit</tt>.
</p><p>
After you merge from a branch, you don't need it anymore and can
delete it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git branch -d myidea
</pre>
</p><p>
If you decide you want to throw myidea away without merging it, use
an uppercase <tt  >-D</tt> instead of a lowercase
<tt  >-d</tt> as listed above. As a safety
feature, the lowercase switch won't let you delete a branch that hasn't
been merged.
</p><p>
To list all local branches, simply run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git branch
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x160cf98"></a>
Viewing Changes</h2></div></div><p>
Git provides a number of tools to examine the history and differences
between commits and branches. Use <tt  >git log</tt> to view commit histories and
<tt  >git diff</tt> to view the differences between specific commits.
</p><p>
These are text-based tools, but graphical tools also are available, such as
the gitk repository browser, which essentially is a GUI version of
<tt  >git
log --graph</tt> to visualize branch history. See Figure 2 for a screenshot.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10971f2.large.jpg"><img src="10971f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x111a580.0x160d3b8"></a>
Remote Repositories</h2></div></div><p>
Git can merge from a branch in a remote repository simply by transferring
needed objects and then running a local merge. Thanks to the
content-addressed storage design, Git knows which objects to transfer
based on which object names in the new commit are missing from the
local repository.
</p><p>
The <tt  >git pull</tt> command performs both the transfer step
(the &ldquo;fetch&rdquo;) and
the merge step together. It accepts the URL of the remote repository (the
&ldquo;Git URL&rdquo;) and a branch name (or a full &ldquo;refspec&rdquo;) as arguments. The
Git URL can be a local filesystem path, or an SSH, HTTP, rsync or
Git-specific URL. For instance, this would perform a pull using SSH:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git pull user@host:/some/repo/path master
</pre>
</p><p>
Git provides some useful mechanisms for setting up relationships with
remote repositories and their branches so you don't have to type them
out each time. A saved URL of a remote repository is called a
&ldquo;remote&rdquo;,
which can be configured along with &ldquo;tracking branches&rdquo; to map the remote
branches into the local repository.
</p><p>
A remote named &ldquo;origin&rdquo; is configured automatically when a repository
is created using <tt  >git clone</tt>. Consider a clone of Linus Torvald's Kernel
Tree mirrored on GitHub:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone https://github.com/mirrors/linux-2.6.git
</pre>
</p><p>
If you look inside the new repository's config file (.git/config), you'll
see these lines set up:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[remote "origin"]
  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
  url = https://github.com/mirrors/linux-2.6.git
[branch "master"]
  remote = origin
  merge = refs/heads/master
</pre>
</p><p>
The fetch line above defines the remote tracking branches. This
&ldquo;refspec&rdquo;
specifies that all branches in the remote repository under
&ldquo;refs/heads&rdquo;
(the default path for branches) should be transferred to the local
repository under &ldquo;refs/remotes/origin&rdquo;. For example, the remote branch
named &ldquo;master&rdquo; will become a tracking branch named
&ldquo;origin/master&rdquo;
in the local repository.
</p><p>
The lines under the branch section provide defaults&mdash;specific to the
master branch in this example&mdash;so that <tt  >git pull</tt> can be called with
no arguments to fetch and merge from the remote master branch into the
local master branch.
</p><p>
The <tt  >git pull</tt> command is actually a combination of the
<tt  >git fetch</tt> and
<tt  >git merge</tt> commands. If you do a <tt  >git
fetch</tt> instead, the tracking branches
will be updated and you can compare them to see what changed. Then you
can merge as a separate step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git merge origin/master
</pre>
</p><p>
Git also provides the <tt  >git push</tt> command for uploading to a remote
repository. The push operation is essentially the inverse of the pull
operation, but since it won't do a remote &ldquo;checkout&rdquo; operation, it is
usually used with &ldquo;bare&rdquo; repositories. A bare repository is just the
git database without a working copy. It is most useful for servers where
there is no reason to have editable files checked out.
</p><p>
For safety, <tt  >git push</tt> will allow only a
&ldquo;fast-forward&rdquo; merge where the
local commits derive from the remote head. If the local head and remote
head have both changed, you must perform a full merge (which will create a
new commit deriving from both heads). Full merges must be done locally,
so all this really means is you must call <tt  >git pull</tt>
before <tt  >git push</tt>
if someone else committed something first.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article is meant only to provide an introduction to some of Git's
most basic features and usage. Git is incredibly powerful and has a lot
more capabilities beyond what I had space to cover here. But, once you realize
all the features are based on the same core concepts, it becomes
straightforward to learn the rest.
