A high-leverage business project for free software and low-cost hardware.

Too often we hear a project or an idea dismissed because it tries to &ldquo;boil
the ocean&rdquo; instead of something more modest, like poaching an egg. But the
problem with modesty is that we've seen the ocean boiled, many times. Linux
is the prime example. Linus himself half jokingly talked about &ldquo;world
domination&rdquo; in the mid-'90s, long before it actually happened. Other examples
go back as far as J.C.R. Licklider, whose writings on &ldquo;man-computer
symbiosis&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Intergalactic Computer Network&rdquo; predated the personal
computer and the Internet by several decades. Both free software and open
source also were intentional ocean-boiling efforts, which continue to pay off
today in degrees of social, economic and technical value beyond calculation.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11075f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Watching successful ocean-boiling efforts encourages ambitions on the same
scale. It certainly has for me (but we'll leave that one for another
EOF&mdash;after we start seeing results). It also has for Jon 'maddog' Hall, who
has been an accessory to Linux's success right from the start. But, maddog is a
modest guy. These days he's not trying to boil a whole ocean, but instead putting the
heat on just one country: Brazil.
</p><p>
What he's cooked up is Project Cau&atilde; (<a href="http://www.projectcaua.org" target="_self">www.projectcaua.org</a>). Although the Web site's
first paragraph describes it as &ldquo;a Free and Open Source Software and Hardware
(FOSSH) project conceived to make it possible for people to make a living as
a Systems Administrator/Entrepreneur using FOSSH as the basis&rdquo;, its ambitions
are larger than that. maddog wants to create a whole new business category
with lots of jobs in it, while greening everything up by sucking less power
off the grid and making cities more livable.
</p><p>
I got some hang time with maddog when he spoke at an MIT gathering earlier
this year, and I like where he's going with Project Cau&atilde;. He looks at a city
like S&atilde;o Paulo (one of the world's largest) and sees &ldquo;tall buildings and
apartment complexes with servers in the basements and thin clients in the
rooms&rdquo; and &ldquo;large new business opportunities for small entrepreneurs,
manufacturers, and the economics that both support.&rdquo; When people ask,
&ldquo;How
can I make money with free software?&rdquo;, his answer is &ldquo;By renting out thin
clients, server space and services to back both, in large volume and at low
costs.&rdquo;
</p><p>
On the technical side, &ldquo;The software is done, and the hardware is
close.&rdquo; The
University of S&atilde;o Paulo has agreed to design the thin-client hardware and
license the design to manufacturers, who will compete to provide components
and finished gear at the best prices. This will provide some needed income to
the university as well.
</p><p>
&ldquo;But the main part of this isn't technical&rdquo;, maddog says.
&ldquo;It's economic.
Most of our work will go into running the pilot project and preparing
educational and documentation materials. We want to make starting and
maintaining a business as easy as possible, for as many people as
possible.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Thin clients and fat servers make equally good business and technical sense
in a city like S&atilde;o Paulo&mdash;and across the rest of Latin America, where the
vast majority of people live in urban areas, especially as both television
and computing are moving onto the Net and into &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;. A cheap connected
device with a good display (also cheap these days) and a capable server with
plenty of low-latency storage is a bargain for customers and a business for
entrepreneurs who like to be highly connected (literally and otherwise) to
their communities.
</p><p>
With its concentrated urban populations, proactive government, cooperative
universities, advanced manufacturing facilities and growing FOSSH-friendly
technical community, Brazil is a large lever on the rest of Latin America
and the world beyond. &ldquo;After we get it working in Brazil, we'll translate the
materials into Spanish, then run pilots in other countries. Or help others do
it for themselves. We'll all learn by doing.&rdquo;
</p><p>
For a new entrepreneur, here's the drill:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Train on FOSSH system administration.
</p></li><li><p>
Get certified, licensed and bonded.
</p></li><li><p>
Get letters of intent from prospective customers.
</p></li><li><p>
Get underwritten loan commitments from banks.
</p></li><li><p>
Buy and install the gear.
</p></li><li><p>
Deliver services.
</p></li><li><p>
Get feedback from services.
</p></li><li><p>
Improve documentation and shared knowledge with others in the same business.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The most recent developments are timely. Says maddog:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The other main driver for Project Cau&atilde;, Douglas Conrad of OpenS Tecnologia,
has put together a home-theater thin-client solution that we will start
selling through the &ldquo;Entrepreneurs&rdquo;. This will show people that the SA/E
(system administrator/entrepreneur) model can work and that SA/Es can sell
things, support clients and make money.
</p><p>
We want to show the prototype at FISL (June 28&ndash;July 2nd) in Porto Alegre,
Brazil, and have it ready to start being sold by SA/Es shortly after that. We
will probably have intensive training on Project Cau&atilde; in the
November/December time frame at Latinoware in Foz do Iguassu, Brazil.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Right now, maddog and friends are evangelizing the project and raising funds.
maddog says, &ldquo;We need that funding because volunteers only get us so far. Some
things require funding, such as legal work, working with the government,
paying fees for registration, typing and clerical work, documentation, buying
hardware and other areas. Once we have the money guaranteed, we can start
hiring and begin the project in full force. It should take six months from
that point until we start a pilot.&rdquo; His goal for funding at the outset:
&ldquo;Three million US dollars, guaranteed.&rdquo;
</p><p>
For investors, the &ldquo;play&rdquo; isn't Project Cau&atilde;, but the entrepreneurs it
bootstraps. For the biggest and most aggressive investors, $3 million is an
ATM withdrawal. My advice for them&mdash;and for anybody wanting to heat things
up&mdash;is to step up to Project Cau&atilde;'s table and start placing some good
bets.
</p><p>
Postscript: thanks to maddog for his patience while I wrote this up and to
podcast.de for some of the quotage.
