This month's article is in a different format from usual; normal
service will resume next month. I recently scraped together some cash
to buy a Blu-ray drive, and like every other user, I found there was
no immediate way to play the disc other than reboot into an OS I won't
mention. Therefore, this month, I cover Blu-ray-specific projects,
highlighting individual parts of what later will become a whole in basic
playback of Blu-ray discs&mdash;I hope.

libbluray&mdash;Blu-ray Playback Library
(<a href="http://www.videolan.org/developers/libbluray.html" target="_self">www.videolan.org/developers/libbluray.html</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
According to the libbluray Web site:
&ldquo;libbluray is an open-source library designed for Blu-ray discs playback
for media players, like VLC or MPlayer.
This research project is developed by an international team of developers
from Doom9.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The Web site lists the project's features as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Portability: currently supported platforms are GNU/Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
Dependencies are very limited.
</p></li><li><p>
Freedom: libbluray is released under a Free Software license, ensuring it
will stay free.
</p></li><li><p>
Features: the library integrates navigation, playlist parsing, menus and BD-J.
</p></li><li><p>
Legal: libbluray is DRM-circumvention-free, and thus, safe to integrate in
your software.
</p></li><li><p>
Fun: libbluray is a fun-to-hack-on project in its starting phase.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11081f1.large.jpg"><img src="11081f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
I'm watching a Blu-ray movie under Linux. How? Read through to the end,
but I guarantee you won't like it.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
To install libbluray, you need to grab a binary from somewhere
(like the Ubuntu Personal Package Archive, for instance), or you
need to grab the source. To get the source, you need to have git
installed. Once you have git, enter the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ git clone git://git.videolan.org/libbluray.git
</pre>
</p><p>
Once that downloads, change into the new directory and compile
like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd libbluray
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ su
# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
The main note here is that &ldquo;Most commercial Blu-ray are protected by AACS
or BD+ technologies, and this library is not enough to play back those
discs&rdquo;. This is simply a library, and you'll need a player like
MPlayer or VLC compiled against it. This is the first of several libraries
I'm going to cover, so let's move on to the next.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a3580.0x239bf08"></a>
libaacs&mdash;AACS Reading Library
(<a href="http://www.videolan.org/developers/libaacs.html" target="_self">www.videolan.org/developers/libaacs.html</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
To quote the libaacs Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
libaacs is a research project to implement the Advanced Access Content
System specification. This research project provides, through an
open-source library, a way to understand how the AACS works.
This research project is mainly developed by an international team of
developers from Doom9.
NB: this project doesn't offer any key or certificate that could be used
to decode encrypted copyrighted material. 
</p></blockquote></div><p>
According to the project page, libaacs features the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Portability: currently supported platforms are GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS X.
The main dependency is libgcrypt for all cryptographic functions.
</p></li><li><p>
Freedom: libaacs is released under a Free Software license, ensuring it
will stay free.
</p></li><li><p>
Legal: libaacs does not include any key or certificate and respects copyright.
</p></li><li><p>
Fun: libaacs is a fun-to-hack-on project in its starting phase.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
The installation follows the same procedure as that for libbluray. If you're
grabbing the source, enter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ git clone git://git.videolan.org/libaacs.git
</pre>
</p><p>
Change into the new directory with the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd libaacs
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, repeat the next few lines from my libbluray installation instructions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a3580.0x239c6f0"></a>
libbdplus&mdash;Purpose Unconfirmed
(URL Unknown)</h2></div></div><p>
Perhaps the missing link in basic Blu-ray playback, I translated this
from a French Web site:
&ldquo;libbdplus is a library for decrypting protected BD + Blu-ray
discs. Currently in development, the project will certainly be hosted
by the VideoLAN team if legal clarification is achieved.&rdquo;
</p><p>
However, finding this library seems to be a mystery in itself, which
I'm guessing may be kept under wraps for legal reasons. On the first
page of Googling, I came across this e-mail from the MPlayer archives:
&ldquo;Can you send me a link to the hidden libbdplus git?
Or the source snapshot? Thanks.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Indeed, I've seen references on other mailing lists referring to this
trio of libraries being the key to basic playback. Although I couldn't
confirm it with my one-and-only Blu-ray disc (and meager download limit),
it seems that unencrypted discs can be played back with the first library,
and these last two are needed for encrypted discs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a3580.0x239c958"></a>
DumpHD&mdash;HD Decrypter
(<a href="http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=123111" target="_self">forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=123111</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
While I must stress from the outset that I couldn't get this to rip my
only disc, it looks to be invaluable nonetheless. Also developed by the
Doom9 folks, like libbluray and libaacs, DumpHD is a sleek GUI program
for decrypting HD-DVD and Blu-ray discs and dumping the files onto your
hard disk. According to the documentation:
&ldquo;DumpHD is a HD-DVD/Blu-ray decrypter based on the idea of BackupHDDVD by
muslix64. The goal of this program is to make a perfect backup without any
traces of AACS.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Also according to the documentation, here are its key features so far:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Dual-Core supported decryption of EVO/M2TS files (for hard-disk-to-hard-disk
speed records).
</p></li><li><p>
Support for every pack type of an EVO (including in-place decryption of
ADV_PCKs, excluding Sequence Key Sections).
</p></li><li><p>
Decryption of every ARF protection type.
</p></li><li><p>
Multiple files (currently CLI only) or complete disc mode.
</p></li><li><p>
Usage of a key database to get the decryption keys or direct retrieval of the
keys off the source disc.
</p></li><li><p>
Supports HD-DVDs for Standard/Advanced Content (but not both on the same
disc), Blu-ray ROM BDMV.
</p></li><li><p>
Experimental Blu-ray recordable support (with multiple CPS Units, BDMV, BDAV
with Aux Directories and Thumbnails).
</p></li><li><p>
Automatic BD+ removal using the BDVM Debugger or manually by supplying a
correct Conversion Table (currently CLI only).
</p></li><li><p>
Streaming output of EVO/M2TS files to stdout.
</p></li><li><p>
Very much console output for free.
</p></li><li><p>
GUI.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11081f2.large.jpg"><img src="11081f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
This snazzy-looking program is DumpHD. It decrypts HD DVD and Blu-ray
discs onto your hard drive.
</p></div></div><p>
Although I don't have space to cover the installation properly, I did find
this program in the Ubuntu repository, and as this is a trickier program,
I hope it'll be in your distro archive too. Using DumpHD at least
is easy. The only real input required from the user is to browse for
the disc's path (/media/INCEPTION, in my case), as well as to browse for
a destination. From here, you need to check only whether you want audio,
video or both, and then click Dump.
</p><p>
Part of my problem appeared to be something to do with external libraries
and helper applications, and their installation and pathing. So far,
the documentation available is strewn haphazardly across README files,
forums, man pages and so on, all as separate elements that are hard to
track down. The same applies for the actual program files themselves,
which is not fun. If anyone wants to help these guys with packaging,
hosting, documentation (anything to make this a cohesive package),
I swear I will cover this program again but in proper detail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22a3580.0x2393ea0"></a>
MakeMKV
(<a href="http://www.makemkv.com" target="_self">www.makemkv.com</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
If you've reached this point of the article filled with despair and
just want to watch a film with your new drive, there is one last resort:
MakeMKV.
</p><p>
Before I continue, this is shareware&mdash;that horrid software model from
the 1980s and 1990s. Nevertheless, installation is quite easy, and its
GUI integration is simply excellent (it managed to include clever
program choices when I right-clicked on the titlebar).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11081f3.large.jpg"><img src="11081f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
MakeMKV: this expensive bit of shareware always gets the job done in
ripping Blu-ray discs to hard drive, but at quite a price.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11081f4.large.jpg"><img src="11081f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The final product: a 27-gig mkv rip that I can finally watch. Worth
it? Not sure.
</p></div></div><p>
Still, you get only a trial period for Blu-ray functionality, at which
point you have to pay for the program. Okay, you're thinking, that
doesn't sound too bad. How much is it? It costs 50 euros. Last
time I looked, that's about eleventy-billion in US dollars. 
</p><p>
I might pay 50 euros for a commercial software player,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>maybe</em></span>,
but for a ripper, no, sorry. Anyway, I have 30 days of trial usage, and
I'm desperate just to watch a film with my new drive, so let's push on.
</p><p>
Head to the Web site's Download page, where at the top, it has a link to
a forum for Linux users. There you'll find all the information with
excellent instructions for installation, with links to two tarballs
you'll need. The installation went perfectly for me, and all I had to
do was download and extract the tarballs, open a terminal in each folder,
and copy and paste some commands.
</p><p>
The GUI is intuitive and largely self-explanatory, but I urge
you to make sure the output folder is on a partition with enough free
space to accommodate these massive files. Ripping something that's 30Gb makes something that's almost 30Gb as well. I guess this is to make
the quality as 1:1 as possible, but I couldn't find anything to lower
the bitrate for storage (half the point of ripping). Maybe I missed
something in the GUI, but I don't think so.
</p><p>
When you get to the ripping stage, you need to choose which title(s) to
rip, and be sure you choose the right ones on the first go. After a big wait,
your MKV should be ready to watch. I hope you chose the right title!
</p><p>
Still, this isn't watching Blu-ray. It's ripping it. And, it takes some
time too. &ldquo;Can we watch the film at your place, honey?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Certainly. I'll
just rip it first and guess at which titles are the film and the special
features, and hope I get it right on the first go.&rdquo;
Less than cool. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Note:</b></span>
</p><p>
Just after writing that section, I found a guide on how to stream from
MakeMKV to VideoLAN. This saves on ripping time, but it also has jittery
performance, and when I tried it with MPlayer, it was very glitchy. For
those wanting to try their luck with this alternative, the guide is
available at <a href="http://themediaviking.com/software/bluray-linux" target="_self">themediaviking.com/software/bluray-linux</a>.
</p><p>
And, that's about as much coverage as I'm willing to give a shareware program.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Linux and Blu-ray may be in a bit of a sorry state for now, but
(encrypted) DVD also had many of the same problems in its first few
years. When I first tried DVDs under Linux (longer ago than I care to
remember), projects like xine were in their infancies. Only unencrypted
DVDs (of which there weren't many around) could be played, and
playback methods were primitive. No menus or navigation, no chapters and
individual .vob files were played one at a time. The Next Chapter button
in xine would skip to the next .vob file (if memory serves correctly).
</p><p>
Now we take Linux DVD playback for granted&mdash;at least for those of us in
countries where libdvdcss isn't a problem. And, unless I'm using something
OSS like VideoLAN, playing DVDs under Windows nowadays is actually more
of a hassle than when I'm in my native Linux. So what about Blu-ray?
</p><p>
Currently, the projects for decrypting and playing Blu-ray discs are spread
around the Net, disparate and unconnected. The streaming method mentioned at the end of
the last section of this article shows it is at least possible to play encrypted discs,
albeit in a bastardized form. Hopefully, we as a community can focus our
efforts in whatever form we can&mdash;hosting, coding, documentation and
so on&mdash;and reach the same point of maturity as projects like
libdvdcss.
</p><p>
If I've made any mistakes along the way, I implore you to
write in and correct me! I'd rather provide some kind of help with
this issue than contribute misinformation.
