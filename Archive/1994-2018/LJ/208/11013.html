An overview of the LSB, the state of LSB specifications, tools,
compliance process and lessons learned.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138e580.0x1486618"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Linux is a dynamic and exciting platform, and its presence in the
marketplace
is now an undeniable fact. But, to an outsider, it can be tempting to ask
&ldquo;which Linux?&rdquo; Given the several leading implementations and several
variations throughout the world, it's easy to wonder how the platform
maintains any consistency.
</p><p>
This is the problem that motivated the creation of the Linux Standard Base
(LSB). By reducing the differences between individual Linux distributions
from the application developers' point of view, the LSB greatly reduces
the costs involved with porting applications to different distributions,
as well as lowers the cost and effort involved in after-market support
of those applications.
</p><p>
For many independent software vendors (ISVs), supporting Linux
also becomes a question of &ldquo;which one?&rdquo; Either they choose a particular Linux
vendor/release and build, test and support that one (or several). Or,
they build against an older distribution, hoping to pick up only
&ldquo;stable&rdquo;
interfaces, shipping their own builds of known problem libraries and
wish for the best. By defining a known, consistent set of interfaces,
the LSB gives ISVs a better chance of building an application that will
work across multiple distributions.
</p><p>
The LSB consists of the following key components:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Specification: a set of requirements that compliant applications
and distributions must meet.
</p></li><li><p>
Tools: a set of tools, tests and informational systems that help
develop the LSB in a collaborative manner as well as help automate the
certification process for applications and distributions.
</p></li><li><p>
Certification: a process to ensure the two-way promise of
platform/application compatibility using the tools and the specification.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The LSB is a core standard for the Linux operating system that encourages
interoperability between applications and the platform. Figure 1 shows the components
and processes of the LSB.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11013f1.large.jpg"><img src="11013f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. LSB Components and Processes
</p></div></div><p>
The LSB specification defines a common set of elements across multiple
Linux distributions that covers the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Packaging and installing guidelines.
</p></li><li><p>
Shared libraries and their interfaces.
</p></li><li><p>
Configuration files.
</p></li><li><p>
File placement (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard = FHS).
</p></li><li><p>
System commands.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Because it is a binary specification, the LSB is divided into both general
and processor-specific components. The following computing architectures
now are supported:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
x86 (IA32).
</p></li><li><p>
x86-64 (AMD64/EM64T).
</p></li><li><p>
Intel IA64 (Itanium).
</p></li><li><p>
IBM PPC 32.
</p></li><li><p>
IBM PPC 64.
</p></li><li><p>
IBM 31-bit S/390.
</p></li><li><p>
IBM 64-bit zSeries.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
By providing a number of guarantees about a typical Linux distribution,
LSB eases the burden for ISVs wanting to write applications for Linux
and support users on their preferred distributions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138e580.0x14878a8"></a>
LSB Tools</h2></div></div><p>
The LSB workgroup provides a number of tools to support the
specification. The most important ones are discussed below, and Figure 2
presents a general overview of the tools.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11013f2.large.jpg"><img src="11013f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. LSB Tools
</p></div></div><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>LSB SDK</b></span> allows application developers to build their
applications in a special environment to ensure that all external
dependencies of the resulting binaries meet the LSB requirements. The
LSB SDK includes special header files that contain only LSB-defined
functions and data types, stub libraries that export only LSB-defined
symbols, and compiler wrappers lsbcc and lsbc++ that launch underlying
GCC components with proper settings to use the special headers and stub
libraries. Using the LSB SDK is easy&mdash;one simply should replace calls
to GCC with calls to the compiler wrappers (for example, by changing
CC/CCX variables). Special .pc files are provided for those developers
using pkg-config. Also, integration of the SDK with Eclipse is supported
via the LSB Eclipse Plugin, which adds additional project types (LSB
executable, LSB shared and static libraries) to the Eclipse environment
and allows one to manage all the settings in a visual way.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>Linux App Checker</b></span> is used by ISVs and application
developers to check their applications for portability across multiple
Linux distributions. The tool is not limited to checking just LSB
requirements; it also enables general portability analysis based on an
internal knowledge base of distribution contents. Currently, the knowledge
base contains information about 70 different distribution
versions. App
Checker accepts as input a set of components comprising an application's
package: binaries and .sos, possibly in various directories or/and packed
in .rpm/tar.gz (arbitrary mix) files. Results of the analysis are visualized
in interlinked HTML reports. For example, external dependencies (libraries
and interfaces) of the application as a whole (internal dependencies
between components are excluded) are visualized with the info of the
&ldquo;portability degree&rdquo; for each dependency and recommendations on
how to improve portability. An interesting aspect is that the tool
can differentiate between required libraries (registered as DT_NEEDED
records in ELF) and libraries actually used by the application.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>LSB Distribution Checker</b></span> is a framework for distribution
developers and OSVs (operating system vendors) to check their systems'
conformance to the LSB. It is actually a whole stack of software
components. The bottom layer consists of actual tests that check specific
requirements for particular components in the target system under
test. The majority of these tests are runtime unit tests, but there
also are special checkers, including static verification mechanisms. The
middle layer is the framework to control test execution and results
collection. And finally, the top layer is the user interface over all
the components. The browser-based interface supports &ldquo;one
button&rdquo;
execution of all certifications tests. Alternatively, the user can
select specific tests to run, which can be useful for upstream developers
interested in testing only particular components. Note that the
LSB Distribution Checker can be used not only for LSB compliance testing,
but also as a general QA testing framework. During development of the
tests and their regular execution, the LSB workgroup has identified
hundreds of bugs in various distributions and upstream components,
which were reported and acknowledged by the upstream and distribution
developers.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>LSB Navigator</b></span> is an integrated on-line informational
system over a corresponding database that holds structured information
about LSB elements, about the Linux ecosystem, as well as service data
used in the standardization analysis and decision making. Correspondingly,
one can distinguish three parts of the Navigator:
</p><p>
1) Interactive on-line version of the LSB specification, which might
be much more useful in a practical perspective compared to the plain
specification text. It provides searchable and browse-able information about
standardized and non-standardized Linux modules, libraries, interfaces,
types and so on. For example, given an interface name, one can find out the
following in
two clicks:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Whether the interface is in LSB.
</p></li><li><p>
Recommendations on using the interface or any of its alternatives.
</p></li><li><p>
Direct links to the interface's documentation.
</p></li><li><p>
What libraries in which distributions provide the interface.
</p></li><li><p>
How many registered applications use the interface.
</p></li><li><p>
Which open-source tests check the interface (can be used as interface
usage examples).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
2) Analytical data about popular Linux distributions and applications,
for example:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Interface &ldquo;popularity&rdquo; lists&mdash;how many applications use each interface (separately for LSB and non-LSB interfaces). 
</p></li><li><p>
See what external libraries and interfaces are required and actually used by popular applications.
</p></li><li><p>
See which elements modern Linux distributions consist of (particular
versions on various hardware platforms).
</p></li><li><p>
Analyze and compare distributions (statistics on Linux elements in each
distribution, which distributions provide/miss a particular version of a
component, library, command, interface and so on).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
3) LSB workgroup services for structuring standardization process and
decision support, for example:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Statistics on LSB evolution (which element appeared/disappeared in which LSB version).
</p></li><li><p>
Analytical data on which popular elements (used by numerous applications
and provided by majority of distributions) are not yet in LSB&mdash;this serves as a basis for expanding the standard.
</p></li><li><p>
Service data like the test coverage and documentation coverage of particular libraries.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
All the tools are integrated&mdash;there are links in the Application and
Distribution checkers to pages in the Navigator. Also, the checkers are
integrated with the Certification system and allow one to submit test
data to the Linux Foundation for certification, right from within the
checkers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138e580.0x1880d88"></a>
LSB Certification</h2></div></div><p>
LSB certification is a two-way promise of platform/application
compatibility. For distributions, being certified is a guarantee that all
required LSB commands and interfaces are available on the platform. For
ISVs, it is a guarantee that their applications do not rely on anything
not provided by either the LSB or the ISV itself in its application
package or dependent packages. Both distributions and applications can
be certified.
</p><p>
The vendor submits the test results to the Certification Authority
(the Linux Foundation). The Linux Foundation reviews the results and
either issues the certification or requests the vendor to correct issues
and/or resubmit tests with questionable results. The vendor will need
to sign a Trademark License Agreement to use the LSB trademark and pay
any necessary fees.
</p><p>
The best way to get started with certification is to use the
checkers&mdash;the LSB Distribution Checker for OSVs and the Linux Application Checker for ISVs.
Once the vendor has addressed any issues found by the tools, the checkers
can upload the test data to the Certification system to begin the
certification process.
</p><p>
Certification puts the application or distribution on the Linux
Foundation's official certification list, and it provides marketing materials
for developers to advertise their certification. You also will be
allowed to use the LSB trademark/branding in your packaging/advertising.
</p><p>
LSB certification secures a number of benefits for the whole Linux
ecosystem:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
App vendors need to do only one port.
</p></li><li><p>
Distro vendors get more apps ported to the Linux platform.
</p></li><li><p>
End users can choose their distro and their apps without vendor lock-in .
</p></li></ul></div><p>
There is an auto-catalytic effect driven by the LSB (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11013f3.large.jpg"><img src="11013f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

LSB Releases</h2></div></div><p>
Figure 4 shows the history of LSB releases. LSB 4.0, introduced a number of
major improvements:
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11013f4.large.jpg"><img src="11013f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. LSB Release Timeline
</p></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Expanded coverage: seven completely new libraries and around 1,000
new interfaces were added as compared to its predecessor, LSB 3.2. Four
completely new test suites and many new tests in the existing test
suites expanded the test coverage significantly.
</p></li><li><p>
Version independence in tools: with the advent of
backward-compatible standards starting with LSB 3.0, the proliferation
of different LSB versions and the collection of corresponding tools
and tests to support them, things were becoming confusing. LSB 4.0 introduced
version-independent tools and tests that support all LSB versions
starting from 3.0, which means users can select which LSB version they
target when using the new tools, making it easy to move back and forth
on the version stack as needed without the need for re-installation.
</p></li><li><p>
Best-effort dynamic linking: perhaps the largest difference
between an LSB-compliant application and a native Linux application
involves the use of the LSB dynamic linker. This has been used in
the past to resolve difficult compatibility problems, allowing the
native environment to differ from the LSB while still supporting LSB
applications. LSB 4.0 debuted a new build strategy that allows an LSB
application to run using the native environment when the LSB dynamic
linker is not present.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Figure 5 shows the list of currently certified LSB 4.0 distributions. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11013f5.large.jpg"><img src="11013f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. LSB Certified Distributions
</p></div></div><p>
LSB version 4.1, released in March 2011, has the following
main changes from LSB 4.0:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Additional symbols: a number of additional symbols have been
added based on ISV demand. These are primarily symbols from glibc and
related libraries, with a few new symbols brought in by uplifts of GTK
and Cairo.
</p></li><li><p>
ALSA: ALSA has been a trial-use module in previous releases. For
4.1, the workgroup has promoted ALSA to a required component and included
both shallow and normal-level tests for the ALSA interfaces.
</p></li><li><p>
Enhancements to printing: printing enhancements include the
addition of ipp/HTTP interfaces from CUPS, as well as a GTK uplift that
includes the common printing dialog.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138e580.0x1881e60"></a>
Lessons Learned</h2></div></div><p>
The LSB workgroup has been working on the standard since the early 2000s,
moving together with the evolving Linux ecosystem. We've learned a number
of things along the way that are worth sharing with the community:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Need for upstream documentation:
good standards should rely on a good documentation for the elements
they define. In the case of LSB, the most burning point is poor upstream
documentation of library interfaces. A number of good interfaces could
not be included in the standard due to this reason. We would like to
encourage upstream developers to pay attention to the documentation
quality for their components as it helps develop consistent applications.
</p></li><li><p>
Test what you document:
upstream components should have good functional tests that can check
correctness of the component's implementation against the requirements
stated in the documentation. Ideal conformance tests should have an
explicit linkage between particular checks in the tests and particular
requirements in the documentation, thus enabling traceability during
testing.
</p></li><li><p>
New methods for developing interface standards:
LSB is the biggest interface standard in the world. It embraces dozens
of thousands of elements. Previous interface standardization efforts
counted far fewer elements (for example, POSIX includes just about 1,800
interfaces). The huge number of elements makes it mandatory to use
special methods and tools for developing the standard; otherwise, it
is impossible to manage the complexity. The LSB workgroup, jointly with
ISPRAS (Institute for System Programming of Russian Academy of Sciences), has developed a number of leading-edge methods and supporting tools to make development of the standard
systematic and manageable. These include automatic generation of some
parts of the LSB specification and tools, a systematic process and
supporting tools for identifying candidates for inclusion into LSB and
moving them through the standardization process stages.
</p></li><li><p>
Continuous testing&mdash;find problems early:
our approach to testing has changed with time. In the past, our focus
on testing has been limited to ad hoc QA on our own software and the
auditing of results from customer tests. At some point, the LSB workgroup
started running its own regular tests of both the enterprise and community
distributions, as well as development versions of those distributions,
and it has been filing bugs with distributions and upstream projects for
found problems. These have resulted in quick deployment of fixes before
they reach the public, both of our tests and of the products being tested.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138e580.0x1792be8"></a>
LSB and the Community</h2></div></div><p>
The relationship between the LSB and the greater Linux community has been
defined largely by the LSB's role as a trailing standard; we document and
test for the behavior designed and developed by the community, rather than
guiding the community to the behavior we design. On occasion, we act as
a clearinghouse when different parties introduce incompatible behavior,
but we intentionally avoid &ldquo;kingmaker&rdquo; roles even then, preferring
to encourage the parties involved to come to a solution on their own.
</p><p>
Another of LSB's community benefits is our recently accelerated testing
strategy, which has resulted in the discovery of numerous compatibility
bugs at an early stage, allowing them to be fixed before they can make it
into the wider world. To our knowledge, we are the only group performing
wide multi-distro compatibility testing in the Linux community.
</p><p>
The challenge, going forward, is to communicate the value of the LSB to
the Open Source Development community more clearly. To this end, we have
been looking at making better use of social media, such as Facebook and
Twitter, and in generating more statistics about our contributions.
</p><p>
A number of items on the rolling project plan page
could be candidates for future versions of LSB. The workgroup generally
finalizes the plan for the next release at a face-to-face session,
weighing the demand/return for the development work to add new modules
with the available resources we have to work on the LSB. Contributions to
LSB are always welcome, and if a contributor was to provide a complete
module with specifications and tests, it certainly would increase the
chances of being added to the next version of LSB.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x138e580.0x1792e50"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The LSB provides a standardized and tested common set of interfaces for
ISVs to target, thus addressing the platform fragmentation problem.
LSB's goal is to make the ISV's incremental cost of targeting
each additional distro approach zero. The LSB Certification mark is
available to distros and apps alike. By enabling ISVs to target the
LSB rather than any one distro, the LSB enables portability across
distributions. Also, the LSB serves as a place where distros, upstream
maintainers and ISVs can come together to solve problems and prevent
regressions. Interoperability often is more about having a forum to
resolve differences rather than any one approach being correct.
</p><p>
LSB has gone through a long evolution together with the Linux
ecosystem. 
Looking forward to advancing the
standard further, the LSB workgroup appeals to the community to participate
and contribute to the effort to help secure the success of the Linux
platform as a whole.

Acknowledgements</h2></div></div><p>
The authors would like to acknowledge all companies, developers, community
members, Linux Foundation members and employees, the ISPRAS team and everyone
else who contributed to the LSB efforts. Such an industry-wide initiative
as LSB would be impossible without the wide support and talented people
involved.
