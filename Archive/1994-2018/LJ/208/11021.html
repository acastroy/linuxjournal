Unison is a program for bidirectional synchronization of files using the rsync
algorithm.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1702580.0x17fa1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Unison is a file synchronization tool that supports bidirectional updates of
files and directories. It uses the rsync algorithm to limit the size of updates
to only what has changed. The program runs on UNIX-based systems as well as
Windows machines and can sync between them. It uses SSH as the default transport
method. 
</p><p>
Unison originated as a
research project at the University of Pennsylvania, and although that project has
moved on (Harmony/Boomerang), the program continues on. This has
led to some misconceptions as to the status of the program that are answered at
the URL provided in the Resources section of this article. The short version is that the program
is very much alive and in active use by many. In this article, I demonstrate
the setup and basic usage of Unison.
</p><p>
The first step is installing Unison on your machine. It is available in package
repositories, although probably as an older version. For instance, on my version of
Kubuntu, 10.04, the package version is 2.27.57. The latest stable version is
2.40.61, at the time of this writing. A lot of usability, performance and
cross-platform improvements have been made between those versions, so for
this article, I 
use 2.40.61. For Windows and Mac machines, current binaries are available
from the Web site's download page. For other platforms, it is necessary to
build from source. 
</p><p>
Complete instructions are available in the manual's Install section
(see Resources). Unison can be built as either a text or GUI (GTK) version,
assuming the appropriate libraries are available. The GUI version also can be
run in text mode via a command-line switch, so it is the most
flexible. The
text-only version is handy for servers where graphical libraries are not installed.
Note: when I built from source, the Quit button did not show up in the GUI
toolbar. As you will see later, that is more annoying than fatal.
</p><p>
Unison can be used and customized in a variety of ways, but trying to cover all the
bases would deplete the magazine's ink allowance for this issue. Instead, I 
demonstrate the way I use Unison on a daily basis as an illustration of what is
possible. My basic setup consists of Unison on three machines: my home desktop,
my laptop and an Amazon EC2 instance. 
</p><p>
Before going into my actual setup, 
bear with me as I explain the basic operating
principles behind Unison. The starting point for Unison are two roots. These are
just directory paths that will be synced. Both paths can be local, or one can be
local and the other remote. The preferred method of connecting local to remote
is SSH, and sections in the manual and wiki (Resources) describe how to set 
up Windows to use SSH. 
</p><p>
Unison also has a socket method where an instance of the
program is set up as a server listening on a socket. The catch is that the data
is transferred unencrypted, so use at your own risk. To keep track of state and
configuration information, Unison creates a private directory. In the absence of
an ENVIRONMENT variable saying otherwise, that directory is $HOME/.unison on
UNIX-like systems. On Windows systems, it's either $USERPROFILE\.unison or
$HOME\.unison or c:\.unison, depending on the settings for USERPROFILE and HOME.
</p><p>
Now, let's move on to the actual setup: desktop &lt;--&gt; EC2 server &lt;--&gt;
laptop. The important
part of the above is that each &lt;--&gt; represents a different Unison root pair. The
desktop Unison program has no knowledge of what is on the laptop, only what it
can see on the EC2 server and vice versa. The role of the EC2 Unison instance in
this scenario is to keep a particular set of files in sync with either the
desktop or laptop, depending on who is asking. In simplest terms, the EC2 Unison
is a server to the desktop/laptop Unison clients, although this is not strictly
true due to the bidirectional nature of Unison. Either Unison instance in a
pairing can serve or receive files. Connection between the desktop/laptop and
the EC2 server is done over SSH using public/private key authentication. For the
purposes of this article, I am using a subset of the paths I normally keep in
sync.
</p><p>
Although it is possible to run Unison by supplying arguments to the program on the
command line, there is a better way&mdash;that is, to create a profile file for each
root pair that is synced. These are *.prf files stored in the ~/.unison
directory. When you start Unison in text mode, you can supply it a some_name
argument that maps to a some_name.prf file. In GUI mode, Unison searches the
~/.unison directory for *.prf files and presents them as choices (Figure 1). For
this article, I am using lj_article.prf (Listing 1).

Figure 1. Profile Choices
</p></div></div><p>
I use this same profile on both the desktop and laptop machines. Let's go through
the lines and detail what they mean. An aside, what I talk about here are
called preferences in the Unison manual. The first two labeled root are the root
pair I'll be syncing. The paths can be either absolute or relative to the
directory in which Unison is started. The first root is an absolute one defining my
home directory. The second takes a little more explaining. The
<tt  >ssh://</tt> indicates
that SSH is used to make the connection to the remote machine. In this
case, I
have used an SSH alias &ldquo;alabama&rdquo; to refer to the remote EC2 host. This expands
as <tt  >aklaver@host_name</tt> and assumes the default SSH port of 22. Should your machine
be running at a different port, the form is
<tt  >ssh://user@host_name:port_number</tt>. The
<tt  >/lj_article</tt> portion is the directory path relative to my home directory on
alabama. If I wanted to specify an absolute directory path, it would look something
like <tt  >ssh://alabama//home/aklaver/lj_article</tt> (note
the two forward slashes). 
</p><p>
With just the two roots specified, running Unison would sync everything in my
local home directory with the lj_article directory on the remote machine. This
is not what I want, so I have included some path preferences. A path preference
is exactly that&mdash;a path to some part of the root that you want to sync. Presence of
a path preference restricts the sync to the paths specified. A path
is relative to the root of the replica, and the separator character is the
forward slash (it will be converted as needed). The important part is that paths
are relative to the root. This means that the data I sync on either my desktop or
laptop is relative to /home/aklaver and becomes relative to
/home/aklaver/lj_article on the EC2 server. A path preference can point to a
single file, a directory or a symbolic link (on Unixen). The path preference is
inclusive, in that if you specify a directory, it syncs everything in that
directory and below. 
</p><p>
To filter what is synced in a particular path, or in
general, ignore preferences are used. The first form used here,
<tt  >Name 'name'</tt> is
one of four types; the others being <tt  >Path 'path'</tt>,
<tt  >Regex 'regex'</tt> and
<tt  >BelowPath 'path'</tt> (this is new to 2.40.16). There is a lot of power here,
explained fully in the Path Specification and Ignoring Paths sections of the
manual. The <tt  >ignore = Name *~</tt> preference uses globbing patterns to ignore any
tilde files in the paths. The second ignore preference
<tt  >ignore=BelowPath
.unison/*</tt> is more specific. It causes anything in .unison and paths below it to
be ignored. This is in contrast to the regular <tt  >Path
'path'</tt> form that matches
only the path specified. I am doing this to avoid syncing the archive files and the
backup directory (more on that later). 
</p><p>
Now I have a quandary. I have said that I want
to sync the .unison path with <tt  >path=.unison</tt> and
ignore it with <tt  >ignore = BelowPath
.unison/*</tt>. At that point, nothing would be synced, and the preferences would be
useless. That is where the ignorenot preference comes in. By specifying
<tt  >Name
*.prf</tt>, I am saying &ldquo;disregard what I said about ignoring what is in .unison for
the specific case of *.prf files&rdquo;. The end result is that I sync only the profile
files in ~/.unison.
</p><p>
The next four preferences configure the backup option. The presence of a
<tt  >backup=</tt>
preference signals that backups are to be done. A backup is done when a file is
changed or deleted by Unison. The backed-up file is kept on the machine where
the change is applied by Unison. So if you make a change to a file on your local
root, when it is synced to the remote root and the change is applied to the
remote file, the previous version of the remote file will be saved on the remote
machine. In this case, using <tt  >Name *</tt> means back up everything. It is possible to
use the path specifications mentioned above to restrict that. 
There also is a
<tt  >backupnot</tt> that operates like
<tt  >ignorenot</tt>. 
</p><p>
The <tt  >backuploc</tt> preference specifies where
the backups are to be stored. The options are <tt  >local</tt>
and <tt  >central</tt>, where
<tt  >local</tt> has the backup files being stored alongside
the original files, and <tt  >central</tt>
moves the backup files to a location as defined in
<tt  >backupdir</tt>. With
<tt  >backuploc=central</tt> and no
<tt  >backupdir</tt> preference, the backups will be found in the
directory backup/ in ~/.unison. This is why I have the <tt  >ignore=BelowPath
.unison/*</tt> preference in the profile. 
Although in this case, I am using
<tt  >~/unison_backup</tt> to store backups, I have other
profiles using <tt  >~/.unison/backup</tt>.
</p><p>
The <tt  >maxbackups</tt> preference is self-explanatory; it
restricts the number of backed-up files to the three most-recent versions.
In its absence, the default is two
versions. I use the central method of backup, because I don't want to sync the
backups. Per my article, &ldquo;Using rdiff-backup and rdiffWeb to Back Up
and Restore&rdquo; (<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, December 2010), I use rdiff-backup to keep
versioned backups already. I do like to keep Unison backups close at hand
though, as insurance if I make an inappropriate change to a profile and
cause a file or files to disappear, or in case I make the wrong decision on which
direction to propagate a change. Besides, I am a firm believer that you cannot
have too many backups.
</p><p>
The <tt  >copythreshold</tt> preference is one of the performance enhancements in recent
versions. Since 2.30.4, it has been possible to tune Unison when doing whole file
transfers or when redoing an interrupted transfer. The rsync code, as used by
Unison, is designed more for doing changes to files than for moving over entire
files. Setting a copythreshold to a positive integer causes Unison to farm out
the job of copying complete files. If set to 0, all whole file
transfers will be farmed out. Otherwise, a number greater than 0 refers to a file
size in kilobytes above which Unison will use another program. By default, that
program is rsync, although that can be changed using
<tt  >copyprog</tt>. Unison also
uses rsync to resume interrupted large file transfers. 
</p><p>
In the same
vein, Unison
2.30.4+ will, without any setting needed, keep track of an interrupted transfer of
a new directory. Whatever has been transferred will be stored in a temporary
directory away from the intended destination, on the receiving side, and on the
next transfer, it resumes with the untransferred files.
</p><p>
At this point, running this profile is anti-climatic. The first run pops up a
warning about there not being archive files present for the root pair (Figure
2). The archive files are where Unison stores its information about the roots
and files synced. Pressing Enter starts the process of the initial scan and
the population of the archive files. After the scan is done, the GUI presents the
choices available for file transfers (Figure 3). In this case, because the remote
path is empty, all arrows point from local to alabama. There are two options 
here: arrow down through each choice and press Enter, or type the letter g
as a shortcut for the Go button and start the transfer of all the files at once.
On subsequent transfers, the choices for each directory/file may well be
different, depending on the changes made on each root (Figure 4). The choice
presented is not set in stone, and you can change it with the arrow
and Skip buttons on the toolbar, dealing with each file as necessary.

</p></div></div><p>
For batch
actions on the files, use the Actions menu (Figure 5). Also worth
mentioning is
the Ignore menu item. It is very handy in that it will write an ignore
preference to your profile matching the item you select using the ignore type
you select. With version 2.40.1+, a profile
editor is built in to the GUI interface. So, if you decide you want to undo the
ignore preference, simply go to the Synchronization menu and then Change Profile.
</p><p>
As mentioned previously, when I built the GUI, it did not have the Quit button.
Typing q as a shortcut still works, or you can go through the Synchronization
menu to get to Quit.

</p></div></div><p>
So, what happens if a file has been changed on both roots since the last sync?
The default action is to skip syncing that particular file, and this is
represented by a ? in the file listing (Figure 6). It is left up to the user
to decide what to do in that situation. That said, preferences 
can be set to force Unison's hand (search for &ldquo;force&rdquo; in the
manual). Should you
decide to sync, some tools are available to help you make a decision on what
to do with a file. For nonbinary files, you can use the Diff button to look at
the diff between a pair of files to help figure things out. There also is the
Merge button. This requires some extensive preparation, and I have not used it
since I first tried Unison many years ago (at the time there were known issues
with the merge code). Since then, considerable work has gone into making merge
functional, and it is on my to-do list to give the new code a spin. 
The manual provides detailed instructions for setting up merge, if you are so inclined.

</p></div></div><p>
With all these files flying around, how safe is your data? For a more complete
discussion, see the Invariants section of the manual. The essence of that section
is that Unison guarantees certain behavior for the paths synced as well as its
own information about the process, at any moment in time. For paths, that is that
they are either at their original state or their completed changed state. The
same principle applies to Unison's own private data&mdash;it is either in its
original form or reflects the current successfully completed syncs. My own
experience is that Unison is very forgiving of operator error. A sync
interrupted either intentionally or by mistake is recoverable.
</p><p>
I use Unison on a daily basis to help me keep track of file changes on my laptop
and desktop. Using an EC2 server as an intermediary host, I am able to bounce the
changes from either of my personal machines off the cloud and back to the other
machine. For many years now, Unison has been a must-have program for me. I
hope you find it useful too.
