Tech folks tend to get a bad rap as basement-dwelling creatures unable to
function in polite society. And really, that's true for only 80% of us. Of
course, I'm teasing, but it's hard to deny Linux users and open-source
enthusiasts tend to belong to unique communities. We thought it might be
nice to focus on our Linux community this month, and so the articles you're
about to read should feel as cozy as a Hobbit hole.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner knows his audience and introduces a new
programming language called CoffeeScript. The coffee-/java-/bean-naming
convention is nothing new, but CoffeeScript makes JavaScripting fun and
easy. If you've ever been frustrated with JavaScript, you'll want to read
Reuven's article. Following that, Dave Taylor continues his series on
determining the day of the week. If you truly do live in a basement or
Hobbit hole, you might need your computer to determine what day it is, as
sunlight might be a rare sight.
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin doesn't help the geek stereotype when everything he does is
within a single, dark console window. Kyle uses a screen session to
connect to his favorite programs (all command-line) from anywhere. This
month, he shows how to get Nagios to send notifications to a screen
session instead of e-mail or SMS messages. Bill Childers is back with us
this month as well, and he and Kyle continue their new column, Tales from the
Server Room. If you're a sysadmin, you'll probably relate to their
misery and maybe learn something along the way.
</p><p>
No community is a community without gatherings. Granted, in our world,
those gatherings often are in IRC rooms or in on-line forums. We do have
our meatspace meetups, however, and if you've never been to a LinuxFest, I
highly recommend attending one. This month, I interview Gareth Greenaway
from the Southern California Linux Expo (SCALE) and ask him what it
takes to host a Linux conference. Gareth is easy to talk to, and he has some
practical advice for anyone interested in attending a LinuxFest or
even hosting their own. To contrast the idea of getting together in
person, Mike Diehl talks about Facebook application development. Whether
you're interested in integrating services or creating a new
zombie-pony-themed <span   class="emphasis"><em>Farmville</em></span>, you'll want to read Mike's article.
</p><p>
Some of the core values of our Linux community are standards and
collaboration. The Linux Standards Base attempts to keep the various
flavors of Linux compatible with each other. Sometimes that works better
than others, but we have the current &ldquo;State of Affairs&rdquo; regarding the LSB
for you this month. Jeff Licquia, Stew Benedict and Vladimir Rubanov
provide
an overview of the LSB and talk about how to be compliant. Henry Van
Styn follows them up with an article on Git. Once a group of people start
to collaborate on software, revision control is vital. Henry discusses Git
and how its distributed model makes it so powerful.
</p><p>
As magazine publishers, we surely understand the importance of
communication when it comes to community. With the Linux world, however,
we communicate in multiple ways. One of those methods, which is near and
dear to my heart, is podcasting. Kyle Rankin and I do the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
Insider podcast every month, and if we can do it, you can do it. Charles
Olsen walks through the process of creating a podcast from the planning
stages all the way to the publishing stages. Content, of course, is up to
you. Dan Sawyer takes a slightly different angle, and instead of
podcasting, he shows how to edit radio dramas. If you tend to make
stuff up in your podcast, you already may be walking the line between fact
and fiction, so we wanted to make sure you were prepared either way.
</p><p>
What group of geeks would be worth their salt without allowing their
computers to form a community as well? Whether you want multiple computers
to share a filesystem with Unison (Adrian Klaver shows how), or if you want
your systems to form a cohesive community of their own in a Beowulf cluster
(Howard Powell describes how to do it with Fedora Live CDs), this issue has
you covered. We've also got the full lineup you expect every month.
UpFront articles, new product announcements&mdash;lots of
goodies to soothe your geek itch. And, of course, if the thought of being a
part of the Linux community offends you, well, feel free to read this
magazine by yourself. We won't tell.
