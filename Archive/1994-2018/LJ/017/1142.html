    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1775580.0x186d3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Moo-Tiff is a new distribution of
OSF/Motif 2.0 for Linux, distributed by InfoMagic Inc. in the U.S.
and by Lasermoon Ltd. in Europe. (For a more in-depth explanation
of Motif, see my review of SWiM and MetroLink Motif in the July
1995 issue of the <i  >Linux Journal</i>.) Priced at
US$99, Moo-Tiff is so far the cheapest solution for Linux users who
want to have a Motif development environment on their PCs.
</p><p>Moo-Tiff comes on a single CD with installation instructions
on the CD sleeve and also on the CD itself. Similar to the
MetroLink and SWiM distributions, Moo-Tiff comes with the Mwm
window manager, shared and static libraries, header files, the Uil
compiler, Mrm, man pages, and source to the OSF/Motif demos.</p><p>What it doesn't include is the OSF Motif 2.0 User's Guide
booklet that accompanies both the SWiM and MetroLink distributions.
This is not surprising, since Moo-Tiff is at least $50 cheaper than
the other distributions. The Motif 2.0 User's Guide is, however,
supplied in Postscript format on the CD, as is other OSF
documentation, including the Motif Programming Guide. Moo-Tiff is
geared toward an X11R6 system, but also includes X11R5 libraries
for users still running X11R5. Also included on the CD is the
complete XFree 3.1.1 distribution, ELF libraries, and an archive of
freeware Motif programs. There is also an option to run Moo-Tiff
directly from the CD, by mounting the &ldquo;live&rdquo; directories from the
CD on your system.</p><p>Installation involves simply running an installation script,
which takes care of everything for you. While poking around in the
installation directory, I noticed a striking similarity between
Moo-Tiff and SWiM. It seems that the Moo-Tiff libraries are
identical to SWiM's. In fact, many of the installation packages
were identical to the ones on the SWiM CD. Since Lasermoon is
involved with distributing both SWiM and Moo-Tiff, this is not
really surprising. There are differences, however, and these lie
mainly in the location of the installed components and Moo-Tiff's
cleaner installation. Moo-Tiff's installation went by very
smoothly, without any errors or quirks. [Lasermoon says that the
libraries are on different development paths and may diverge, and
there is no guarantee that applications linked with SWiM shared
libraries will work with Moo-Tiff, and vice-versa.[Ed]</p><p>After installing Moo-Tiff, I fired up Mwm and went straight
to the installed demos directory to compile some of the demos and
test the product. Using the supplied mxmkmf program, all I had to
do was type
<b  >mxmkmf</b>
 to turn Imake files into Makefiles, then
<b  >make</b>
 to compile. Sure enough, the demos compiled and ran correctly. I
also recompiled most of the Motif programs I already had, such as
Mosaic, just to make sure things worked okay. They did.</p><p>Moo-Tiff seems to be a great product, especially considering
its $99 price tag. I have had no problems with it at all, except
for one little thing. One of the installed programs, xmbind, is
linked with the X11R5 libraries instead of the X11R6 ones, and I
couldn't find one linked with the R6 libraries anywhere on the CD.
This is not that big a deal, except that I must have R5 shared libs
on my system if I want to use xmbind.</p><p>Support and update/bugfix information for Moo-Tiff can be had
