September 1. While paper costs have risen steadily for some time,
we have until now kept our original subscription price. But our
last printing bill increased 20 percent because of higher paper
prices, and we are no longer able to absorb the extra cost. The
price for a one-year subscription in the US is now US$22; outside
North America it's US$32. See the new insert card for other
subscription rates.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2881580.0x2979240"></a>Digital Releases BLADE</h2></div></div><p>Digital has released a preliminary &ldquo;end-user&rdquo; release of
Linux/Alpha, called BLADE&mdash;short for &ldquo;Basic Linux/Alpha
Distribution Eyesore&rdquo;. As you can probably tell from the name, the
&ldquo;end-users&rdquo; in mind are developers. It is designed to install on
a &ldquo;NoName&rdquo; AXPpci33 motherboard with a SCSI drive. Networking is
not completely working as of this writing, although some
capability, including telnet, ftp, and rlogin are now working.
X-Windows functionality is not yet ready to be included in the
distribution, but work on both networking and X-Windows is
progressing.</p><p>Following are the minimum hardware requirements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Digital AXPpci33 motherboard with SRM console
firmware</p></li><li><p>8MB or more main memory</p></li><li><p>1.44MB floppy drive</p></li><li><p>100MB or larger IDE or SCSI hard drive (340MB or
larger suggested if you're going to do any kind of serious software
development)</p></li><li><p>VGA video board and monitor</p></li><li><p>Keyboard</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2881580.0x2979818"></a>WYSIWYG for Linux</h2></div></div><p>One of the most requested products to be ported to Linux is a
WYSIWYG word processor (see &ldquo;Reader Survey Results&rdquo;, this issue).
Caldera has announced that it has contracted with Novell to port
and develop <span   class="bold"><b>WordPerfect 6.0 for
Linux</b></span>. According to Caldera, their native port for Linux
will be available some time during 4Q95 and will include HTML
authoring tools to allow users to prepare documents for the World
Wide Web.</p><p>Caldera is also porting the OpenDoc engine to Linux, and will
be providing it and their own ORB (&ldquo;Object Request Broker&rdquo;, an
important facility upon with OpenDoc is built) as part of the
Caldera Network Desktop.</p><p>OpenDoc provides a vendor-independent way for applications to
work together. For those familiar with Microsoft's proprietary OLE
(&ldquo;Object Linking and Embedding&rdquo;), OpenDoc provides all the
services provided by OLE, and more. It is developed and endorsed by
a large consortium of companies, including Novell, IBM, Apple, and
now Caldera, and it runs on Unix and Unix-like operating systems as
well as MacOS, MS Windows, and OS/2.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2881580.0x2979a28"></a>Columnist on Leave</h2></div></div><p>Mark Komarinski, author of <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s &ldquo;Linux System Administration&rdquo; column, is
writing a book on Linux, and so has suspended his column for a few

year.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2881580.0x2979b88"></a>Linux at Open Systems World</h2></div></div><p>Open Systems World (OSW) is hosting its Second Annual Linux
Conference at OSW '95 in Washington, DC. As we did last year,
<i  >Linux Journal</i> will be sponsoring and
organizing the event, which will be held on November 13 and 14. OSW
will continue through Friday, November 17.</p><p>Like last year, the two-day conference will include one day
of sessions and tutorials and a one-day class for novice and
intermediate Linux users. This year, the schedule is more
streamlined, with more time allotted for questions and answers than
last year, as so many attendees requested.</p><p>The sessions on Monday will include a panel of several
companies which are commercially involved with Linux in different
ways. They will present what they do with Linux and then
participate in a panel discussion. Linux International, a group
which promotes Linux for both personal and business use, will give
a presentation detailing its activities and its plans for future
activities. Author Matt Welsh will give a short class on porting
Unix applications to Linux, and there will be several other
presentations as well.</p><p>Monday night, a BOF (Birds of a Feather) session will be
held. Those intending to attend the conference who wish to also
attend the BOF session are encouraged to send e-mail to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a> so
that we can schedule an appropriate and convenient meeting
space.</p><p>Tuesday, there will be an all-day tutorial entitled &ldquo;Linux
for the New User&rdquo;. Topics will range from &ldquo;What and Why Linux?&rdquo;
through choosing a distribution, installing networking, installing
and configuring the X Windows System, and finding the Linux
applications you need.</p><p>On both days, the format will be open, and questions from the
audience will be gladly accepted. Time has been set aside for
Q&amp;A sessions, as well.</p><p>Details are available on the WWW from
