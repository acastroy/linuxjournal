    Have you ever written a screen-oriented program under Linux
    and been annoyed by the limitations of the standard curses
    screen manipulation library? Here is a programmer's
    introduction to the vastly superior ncurses library.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1606580.0x16fe450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Since you are clueful enough to subscribe
to <i  >Linux Journal</i>, you may already know that
Linux includes a clone of the Unix screen-handling library,
curses(3). You may also know that Linux's ncurses(3), like its
ancestor, is a general screen-handling library that supports all
popular asynchronous terminal types, including the color-ANSI and
vt100-like capabilities of most Linux consoles. You've certainly
run a program that used curses, vi, perhaps, or any of a dozen
screen-oriented games.
</p><p>You may not know that there are actually two major flavors of
curses, with differences that are important for portability. You
probably don't know (unless you have read ahead) that post-1.9
releases of ncurses include dramatic new features that will make
them far more reliable, powerful, and useful than their
predecessors.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1606580.0x16fe608"></a>curses History</h2></div></div><p>The first curses library was hacked together at the
University of California at Berkeley in about 1980 to support a
screen-oriented dungeon game called rogue. It leveraged an earlier
facility called <span   class="bold"><b>termcap</b></span>, the
terminal capability library, which was used in the vi editor and
elsewhere.</p><p>Termcap consisted of a simple text database format for
describing the control sequences and capabilities of serial
terminals. Before the ANSI standard hundreds of
mutually-incompatible terminal types competed in the market;
termcap described them in a standard way that made it possible for
vi's screen-painting code to be terminal-independent.</p><p>The curses library took this one step further, by defining a
relatively clean C API (applications programming interface) to hide
the details of termcap-based screen painting. This facility was a
terrific success, and gets almost all the credit for lifting Unix
out of the line-oriented interface style inherited from its early
days on ASR-33 Teletypes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1606580.0x16fe818"></a>Enhancements and Controversy</h2></div></div><p>The success of curses did not go unnoticed at Bell Labs.
Later System III releases and System V Release 1 included an
enhanced curses library with many new features. These
included:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Support for multiple screen highlights (BSD curses
could only handle one &ldquo;standout&rdquo; highlight, usually
reverse-video).</p></li><li><p>Support for line- and box-drawing using forms
characters.</p></li><li><p>Recognition of function keys on input.</p></li><li><p>Color support (in later versions).</p></li><li><p>Full support for sub-windows.</p></li><li><p>Support for pads (windows of larger than screen
size on which the screen or a sub-window defines a
viewport).</p></li></ul></div><p>The Bell Labs curses was upward-compatible from BSD curses,
and much more powerful. However, its designers made one
controversial major change; they scrapped the all-text termcap
format for terminal capability descriptions, opting instead for a
binary format called terminfo.</p><p>The most important reason for changing formats was that the
BSD termcap database was getting so large that sequential searching
took significant overhead. The terminfo format (binary capability
blocks living in a bushy directory tree), by contrast, was
optimized for fast lookup and fast loading.</p><p>In doing changing to a binary format, however, Bell Labs
curses gave up two valuable features: extensibility and the ability
to edit terminal descriptions with standard text tools. The termcap
routines had never actually cared what the capabilities meant to
the program using them, whether it was curses or something else.
Thus, it was easy to add new capabilities and new interpretations;
in fact, later BSD releases used the same code for printer- and
modem-capability databases. In terminfo, by contrast, additions to
the database format required a recompile of the library.</p><p>AT&amp;T's no-source-code policy meant that Bell Labs curses
itself never got a chance to outcompete the BSD version in the
hacker community. Worse, the tradeoffs in the terminfo format meant
that the largely BSD-centric hacker culture had a passable excuse
to denigrate the major new capabilities in Bell Labs curses.</p><p>For more than five years, then, freeware authors writing
screen-oriented programs were in the vexing situation of having to
design around the older, less-capable BSD interface even on
machines that supported the Bell Labs curses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1606580.0x16fef50"></a>Source Code Freedom</h2></div></div><p>Around 1982, noted hacker Pavel Curtis (formerly of Xerox
PARC, now perhaps best known for his MOO project) attacked this
problem head-on by starting work on a freeware clone of Bell Labs
curses. This package was part of Pavel's personal toolkit; it was
not widely distributed, or even very well known, until Zeyd
Ben-Halim,
<a href="mailto:zmbenhal@netcom.com">zmbenhal@netcom.com</a>,
took over the development effort in late 1991. I got involved in
late 1993 to support a screen-oriented multi-user Unix BBS I was
developing.</p><p>The early ncurses versions had some serious drawbacks. The
biggest problem was that a good many important Bell Labs curses
capabilities were absent, leaving annoying and unpredictable gaps
in the API. The documentation was poor and not suited to on-line
browsing. Very little systematic compatibility testing against Bell
Labs curses had been done. Last, but not least, all versions up to
1.8.5 had serious bugs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1606580.0x16ff108"></a>Quality Improvements</h2></div></div><p>Much has changed in the last year, out of sight of the Linux
community at large. We have fixed many bugs and filled out the API.
We've written more complete documentation, including man pages.
We've done extensive compatibility testing against SVR4, linking
identical programs to both libraries and comparing behavior. We've
audited the code carefully for cross-platform portability and
replaced a rather clunky home-brewed configuration system with GNU
autoconf. We've tested the code for memory leaks with Purify and
improved argument validation in many critical functions. The
overall quality of the code has been dramatically improved.</p><p>We've also added several Bell Labs-like utilities missing
from older ncurses versions, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>infocmp(1) a terminfo entry lister and
comparator.</p></li><li><p>captoinfo(1) a termcap to terminfo
translator.</p></li><li><p>clear(1) a trivial screen clearer.</p></li><li><p>tput(1) a terminfo capability access for shell
scripts.</p></li></ul></div><p>The captoinfo, clear, and tput utilities are based on code
from Ross Ridge's mytinfo package (which we've effectively
subsumed).</p><p>We chose System V Release 4.0 curses as our emulation target,
and now support all of its very extensive features. We also include
a clone of the SVR4 panels library, a curses extension that makes
it easy to program stacks of windows with backing store.</p><p>The new ncurses package also includes a full and up-to-date
set of man pages organized similarly to SVR4's.</p><p>In a few areas, we go beyond SVR4 curses, for example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The new cursor-movement optimizer and
incremental-screen-update algorithms are smarter than the Bell Labs
versions (and <span   class="emphasis"><em>much</em></span> smarter than the BSD
versions) leading to significant update-speed gains for slow
terminals.</p></li><li><p>Unlike previous curses versions, ncurses can write
the lower right hand corner cell of a terminal with automargin wrap
(provided it has an insert-character capability).</p></li><li><p>On Intel boxes, curses permits you to display not
just the IBM high-half characters but also the ROM graphics in
characters 0-31.</p></li><li><p>Our terminfo tools recognize all the terminfo and
termcap extensions found in GNU termcap, mytinfo, and the
University of Waterloo libraries.</p></li><li><p>We feature a C++ class derived from the libg++
CursesWindow class, but enhanced for ncurses.</p></li><li><p>The ncurses suite now includes an ncurses program
which allows you explicitly test most of ncurses's capabilities on
any new platform.</p></li><li><p>We've souped up the tracing feature. It is now
possible to pick one of several levels of output tracing, and the
trace log has been made easier to interpret (with symbolic dumping
of screen attributes, colors, and so forth).</p></li><li><p>Automatic fallback to the /etc/termcap file can be
compiled in for systems without a terminfo tree. This feature is
neither fast nor cheap, so you don't want to use it unless you have
to.</p></li></ul></div><p>Along with ncurses, you get a very complete terminfo file. I
accepted the maintainer's baton for the 4.4BSD master termcap file
from John Kunze in January 1995; I've since translated it to
terminfo and added a lot of information from vendors like SCO,
Digital Equipment Corporation, and Wyse. (The terminfo file is
available separately from my WWW home page,

skeleton that illustrates how to set up to use some of the new
features.</p><p>Note the way we arrange for <b  >endwin()</b> to
get called by the signal catcher. This is necessary, otherwise a
stray signal might leave the tty modes in a less than useful
state.</p><p>Our next program fragment illustrates the use of the keypad
mapping feature. This code, from an actual test program distributed
with ncurses, is shown is <a href="1124l2.html" target="_self">Listing
2</a>.</p><p>The example code illustrates how you can get function key
tokens as single values outside the ASCII range from
<b  >getch()</b>. The call <b  >keypad(stdscr,
TRUE)</b> sets this up.</p><p>The ncurses distribution contains a more detailed tutorial in
HTML form and also has several code examples in the test
directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1606580.0x16f6a70"></a>The Future of ncurses</h2></div></div><p>The ncurses library seems to have achieved a stable plateau,
suitable for production use, in the 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 releases. We're
looking ahead to some interesting possibilities&mdash;most notably at
supporting XPG4 Curses extended-level features for wide and
multi-byte character sets. We're also thinking about MS-DOS and
MS-Windows ports.</p><p>With the features we already have in a freeware library, you
may be wondering whether there are good reasons for BSD curses to
continue to exist. The answer is &ldquo;probably not&rdquo;.</p><p>Keith Bostic, maintainer of BSD curses, has agreed that if
ncurses 1.9 proves stable and usable with nvi (new vi), he will
switch to ncurses for the nvi distribution and pronounce BSD curses
officially dead. The ncurses library has already been used to
successfully support nvi for production, so it's a good bet that by
the time you read this, Keith will have finished his testing&mdash;and
BSD curses will be history.</p><p>This, in turn, means the Unix world will finally get a common
freeware API that supports color, multiple highlights, and all the
other capabilities common to PC consoles and today's character-cell
terminals.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1606580.0x16f6c80"></a>Update</h2></div></div><p>Since this article was written, Keith Bostic tested ncurses
with nvi, and has officially pronounced the old BSD curses dead.
This means that ncurses will become the official standard curses
for Linux, as well as for all the myriad free versions of BSD
Unix.</p></div></div>
