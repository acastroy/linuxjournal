    Terminal-oriented programs tend to have an unwieldy
    interface, while writing X-Windows applications is
    difficult. By using the gpm client library you can easily
    turn a text-oriented program into an easy-to-port
    mouse-sensitive application.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1763580.0x185b450"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Linux text console is more than a
bare terminal. One of its most important features is the
availability of a mouse device. In addition to supporting
<span   class="emphasis"><em>selection</em></span>, the mouse can be used to interact
with user programs. If your computer runs the
<span   class="bold"><b>gpm</b></span> server your programs can
easily benefit from mouse availability under both the Linux console
and xterm, and run without complaint under other environments.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="1136f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. An application using libgpm
</p></div></div><p>The main difference between a conventional text program and a
mouse-sensitive application is the way they process input&mdash;while
the former reads from <b  >stdin</b> and writes to
<b  >stdout</b>, the latter must multiplex input from
different sources&mdash;we can call it an &ldquo;event-driven&rdquo; application.
I will consistently use &ldquo;program&rdquo; to refer to a
<b  >stdin</b>-driven process and &ldquo;application&rdquo; to
refer to an event-driven one.</p><p>The gpm client library is meant to allow programmers to
easily turn a program into an application by changing only a few
lines of original source code. Alternatively, it offers complete
support to developers designing an application from scratch.
Portability is a major issue here, because you can be tempted to
build a nice full-featured application for the Linux console, which
reveals itself as completely unusable when you remotely log in to
your PC from within an xterm or a bare vt100. Some care must be
taken to avoid this, since a networked Linux computer can easily be
used from a tty which has nothing to do with its own
console.</p><p>The internal structure of a console application is
represented in Figure 1, which outlines what changes required in
the original program so it can respond to mouse events. As you can
see, all mouse support code could be hidden in a separate module,
and mouse-related code in the main body of the source is limited to
the following calls:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >Gpm_Open()</b> The open function
should be called before reading any input. It is used to connect to
the daemon's socket and performs all the setup needed to get back
events from the <b  >gpm</b> daemon.</p></li><li><p><b  >Gpm_Getc()</b> Any call to
<b  >getc()</b> and to <b  >getch()</b> should
be replaced by the <b  >Gpm_</b>-prefixed function. The
replacement code manages multiple inputs and dispatches mouse
events as needed&mdash;more on this later.</p></li><li><p><b  >Gpm_Close()</b> Before
<b  >exit()</b>ing, the mouse connection should be
closed. This call may be omitted, though it isn't nice to do
so.</p></li></ul></div><p>When writing portable code, these few modifications could be
masked out as suggested in the code fragment below. Its role is to
define function names which are independent of mouse availability.
Such preprocessor-specific code would better reside in a header
file, to avoid ugly <b  >#ifdef</b>s in the actual
source. The approach of choice is to hide
<b  >Gpm_Open</b> in <b  >local_mouse_init</b>,
because setting up is more than a function call; conversely,
<b  >local_mouse_close</b> is a syntactic place
holder.</p><p>Any other code referring to the mouse can be put in a
different source file from the general application code. A correct
Makefile (possibly through
<span   class="bold"><b>autoconf</b></span>) can easily choose which
files need to be compiled and which preprocessor defines are
needed, without cluttering the code with
<b  >#ifdef</b>/<b  >#endif</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

<b  >Gpm_Open</b></h2></div></div><p>Choosing a good connection with your mouse device is tricky.
The problem is getting the best event resolution while avoiding
excessive of context switches. Some simple applications need to be
told of only button-press events and can leave cursor-drawing to
the server program; more complex applications, on the contrary,
might want to be told of any single movement of the mouse, as well
as button-press and button-release.</p><p>The <b  >Gpm_Open</b> function gets as an argument
a structure identifying the type of connection requested. The type
of connection in turn is characterized by event masks&mdash;bitmaps
identifying event types. With gpm, two mask are required&mdash;the mask
of events you want to get and the mask of events you want to be
handled in the default way.</p><p>The double mask is useful, because the default way is known.
In particular, since you know that mouse motions cause the cursor
to be drawn, you may often leave motion events to the default
management, thus relieving your application of most of the work of
handling the mouse.</p><p>In addition to event masks, the connecting application must
specify two &ldquo;modifier sets&rdquo;, that is, sets of keyboard modifiers,
such as shift, control, meta (alt) and so on. Within the gpm
server, keyboard modifiers are used to multiplex applications on a
single console. It is handy to be able to paste selected text in a
mouse-sensitive application, while an application taking complete
control of the user's pointer would irritate most of the
customers.</p><p>Each gpm client is asked to specify a &ldquo;minimum set&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;maximum set&rdquo;. The client specifically asks not to be informed
about mouse events with less than the minimum set or more than the
maximum set of attached modifiers. The minimum set will be 0 for
most clients. The gpm-root menu drawer is a client with non-0
minimum mask. This gives selection mouse-only events when there is
no other client. Thus, when running Emacs, you can use the Emacs
mouse facility (by loading the library
<b  >t-mouse.el</b>, within the gpm distribution) and
have access to selection and gpm-root; the lisp package accepts
mouse-only and <b  >alt</b>-mouse, the gpm-root server
gets <b  >ctrl</b>-mouse, and the internal selection
mechanism gets any other events. Within this scheme, selection is a
catch-all, as if it had an infinite maximum-modifiers mask.</p><p><b  >Gpm_Open</b>, then, keeps a stack of
connection masks, so you can reopen the connection to modify your
mask and get back to the previous behaviour on the next
<b  >Gpm_Close</b> invocation. This feature can be used
to either increase or decrease the amount of events you get. Emacs,
for example, disables event reporting in this way when it is
stopped, to allow you to use selection normally with your shell. An
application drawing a menu, by contrast, can only reopen the
connection to get motion events while the menu is kept down. This
stack-like feature is managed in the client library, so that
misbehaving applications can't lock up the server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1763580.0x185c790"></a>Using mev</h2></div></div><p>To test library features without loosing your youth in a
compile-execute-understand-recompile loop, the
<span   class="bold"><b>mev</b></span> program is distributed along
with the gpm server. This tool is based on the idea of
<span   class="bold"><b>xev</b></span>, the X event reporter. mev
reports any event it gets on the current console, and you can
specify on the command line the event and modifier masks to be
used. Thus, mev can help in testing your connection parameters
before you hardwire them in your application. Mev can also
demonstrate use of the connection stack by getting push and pop
commands from standard input.</p><p>Though mev was originally designed as a test case to debug
the gpm server, it is now quite useful in itself and I use it as
the engine for the emacs library.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1763580.0x185c9a0"></a>Taking input from multiple sources</h2></div></div><p>After connecting to the server, the application must respond
to both keyboard events and mouse events. To ease this, libgpm
offers replacement functions for getc and its relatives, but the
application designer is not forced to use them.</p><p>Programmers who want to autonomously manage the two input
channels must invariably use the <b  >select()</b> system
call, unless the application puts the input files in non-blocking
mode and keeps polling them. Polling can be wise if your
application takes a long time to do its job, and you want the user
to be able to regain control with a single key or mouse press. A
good example of this technique is to be found in the
<span   class="bold"><b>Netscape</b></span> WWW browser.</p><p>Many screen-oriented applications, on the contrary, spend
most of their time waiting for user input, and could well benefit
from the functions in libgpm. Externally,
<b  >Gpm_Getc()</b> and its relatives behave just like
the originals when keyboard events are received; internally, they
can receive mouse events and handle them through a user-defined
function.</p><p>These input procedures, as you can imagine, are built around
<b  >select()</b>. This is the only way to relieve the
user from using select in the application body. When stdin is
reported as readable, the original <b  >getc</b> function
is called; when the mouse connection is readable,
<b  >Gpm_GetEvent()</b> is called.</p><p>Applications can invoke <b  >Gpm_GetEvent()</b> by
themselves if they need to, but you must remember that
<b  >Get_Event</b> is based on a
<b  >read()</b> call, and thus is blocking. The normal
gpm input functions (usually <b  >Gpm_Getc</b>) in libgpm
invoke <b  >Gpm_GetEvent</b> only when there is data to
read. The getc-replacing function then delivers the event to a
mouse-handling function specified by the application. Note that
<b  >Gpm_GetEvent()</b> is only in charge of reading the
event from the current source and does not deliver the event to the
mouse-handling function.</p><p>The user function in charge of handling mouse events&mdash;let's
call it &ldquo;mouse handler&rdquo;---is registered by the user in a global
variable before invoking the input functions, and its invocation
doesn't interfere with the running <b  >Gpm_Getc()</b>
invocation. Be careful, however, that the input function is waiting
for the handler to complete; long-running tasks don't fit into the
mouse handler well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1763580.0x1853968"></a>Faking Keys</h2></div></div><p>More often than not, the mouse is simply used as a shortcut
for the keyboard: for example, clicking on a menu-button is like
pressing <b  >f1</b>, clicking on a listbox item is like
entering its highlighted letter, pressing the button outside an
active menu is like issuing the <b  >esc</b> key, and
using the scrollbar is like pressing the arrow keys many times.
Application design is greatly simplified if the mouse can return
keys to the input subsystem&mdash;the dual input mechanism is again
joined into a single input stream, greatly reducing the amount of
status information to be managed.</p><p>Within libgpm, this behaviour is enforced by the return value
of the mouse handler. The handling function returns an integer
value which gets interpreted in the following way:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >EOF</b> This value is used to signal
a fatal error and will cause the input function to return the same
value to the caller.</p></li><li><p><b  >0</b> A zero return value means that
the input function should go on as before, without returning to the
caller. The event is considered eaten by the handler and no
key-press is simulated.</p></li><li><p><b  >Anything else</b> Any other value is
considered a &ldquo;simulated&rdquo; keystroke character, and is returned to
the caller. Note that these values are not limited to ASCII
characters&mdash;any integer value can be returned.</p></li></ul></div><p>Before returning a fake key, the input functions set a global
variable, which signals that the key is not a true key press;
before returning a keyboard-generated character, the flag is
cleared. Applications are free to use or ignore this information.
Personally, I have never used it.</p><p>Note that the ability to return any integer value is powerful
and is perfectly compatible with the libc environment, because
<b  >getc()</b> returns an integer by definition. Return
values exceeding a character range can be used to encapsulate mouse
activity into a generic &ldquo;event&rdquo; integer entity, and the same
<b  >switch</b> construct in the main loop can handle any
input the application gets.</p><p>Using the fake-key capability, any mouse event can be packed
in an integer value to be interpreted later in the main loop of the
application. Personally, I prefer to interpret the event inside the
mouse handler and return to the caller only a integer belonging to
a small set of actions.</p><p>The mouse handler can also register its intent to return more
keys, so it may be called without waiting for a new mouse event.
Thus, a scrollbar can easily be implemented in the mouse handler by
returning to the caller the right number of arrow key
presses.</p><p>Smart use of the fake-key mechanism can greatly ease the
design of a complex application, with negligible computational
overhead. In practice, you must be careful when you write
mouse-handling code which can't fit the fake-key mechanism; you
must be sure that a user sitting on a vt100 tty without any
pointing device won't loose control of the application by falling
into a state which is unrecoverable without the mouse. It is best
if the unfortunate mouseless user can exploit your application in
full despite limited input capabilities.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1763580.0x1854150"></a>Stacking Applications</h2></div></div><p>Typically, a smart program allows itself to be temporarily
stopped or offers the user the option of spawning a shell. This
ability is often overlooked during program development, because
programmers tend to concentrate on the application itself, rather
than on escaping from it. Before giving away tty control, any
mouse-sensitive program should release the mouse to avoid stealing
events from a user trying to run the selection mechanism within a
shell environment. The preferred way to release the mouse in this
case is to invoke <b  >Gpm_Open</b> with connection
parameters indicating that all events are passed along to the next
service. When the program resumes the user focus, it can simply
<b  >Gpm_Close</b> to restore the previous event masks.
If the application forgets to release the mouse before releasing
the tty, weird things happen.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1763580.0x1854308"></a>Using curses</h2></div></div><p>Usually mouse-sensitive applications manage the screen using
<span   class="bold"><b>curses</b></span> or the compatible
<span   class="bold"><b>ncurses</b></span> library. [See page ?? for
an introduction to ncurses&mdash;Ed] From the point of view of mouse
handling, this doesn't make much difference. You need only to call
<b  >Gpm_Getch()</b> or <b  >Gpm_Wgetch()</b>
in place of the getc or getchar. These replacement functions take
the same arguments as the original curses calls.</p><p>From the mouse-handling point of view, the only difference
between a full-featured curses application and one using normal tty
is in the possible subdivision of the screen into different
windows. Using a single mouse handler makes management non-trivial
if the screen is split into multiple windows. The scenario is dealt
with by the so-called high level library, which is a simple yet
effective set of functions to manage a stack of &ldquo;regions of
interest&rdquo;, easing the dispatch of events to multiple
recipients.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1763580.0x18545c8"></a>The High-Level Library</h2></div></div><p>The high-level part of the gpm library offers entry points to
a centralized data structure responsible for delivering events to
multiple mouse handlers.</p><p>In practice, a double linked list of ROIs (regions of
interest) is maintained, and each ROI is responsible for handling
events for a specific user function with specific &ldquo;clientdata&rdquo;.
Each region is identified by its rectangular limits and by
minimum-modifier and maximum-modifier sets. Thus you can choose to
deliver events to different windows, according to either the event
position or the modifiers used, in a way similar to the
multiplexing of applications on a single console described
earlier.</p><p>When you use a windowed interface, you can take full
advantage of the high level library by creating one or more ROIs
associated with each curses window. In addition to events happening
in the ROI, the handler associated with a region will get &ldquo;enter&rdquo;
events when the mouse cursor enters the region and &ldquo;leave&rdquo; events
when it leaves. This means that a single mouse motion can generate
multiple callbacks to help keep a consistent screen state without
needing a huge set of global state variables.</p><p>Unfortunately, the high level library has been available only
since gpm version 1.0. If you have an older version of gpm you
would do best to upgrade. Lack of the high level library was the
main reason that gpm's version numbers were
0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> for such a long time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1763580.0x1854830"></a>Xterm Support</h2></div></div><p>Within the X Window System, terminal applications are run
within <b  >xterm</b>, and xterm is the only usable tty
you can find on most workstations&mdash;usually workstations are
terribly slow and unusably hostile before X-Windows is
started.</p><p>Fortunately, xterm is able to report mouse events, made up of
escape sequences, which are reported to the client application
through the same channel as normal data.</p><p>Unfortunately, the range of events it is able to report is
severely limited. Moreover, because events are reported through the
same stream as keyboard events, all the nice design of multiple
input channels breaks, and any application which wants to sense
mouse and keyboard events independently fails.</p><p>Fortunately, using <b  >Gpm_Getc()</b> and friends
works quite well, as you can check by running mev under an
xterm.</p><p>If you consider ever running your application under an xterm,
you must be sure to not depend on a full event reporting.
Specifically, you won't be informed of any motion or drag events,
and button-release events won't specify which button of a set has
been released. This means, in practice, that if you need precise
reporting of a double-button press, your application will not work
properly under xterm.</p><p>I strongly urge you to be careful; if the application can
only run under the Linux console, it is of limited use, and you'll
surely swear at yourself sooner than you may expect. If, on the
contrary, the application is able to run under xterm, it is better
exploiting the ability to (at least) invoke buttons by a simple
mouse press, rather than forcing the user to use keyboard-only
interaction.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1763580.0x1854ba0"></a>Using GNU autoconf</h2></div></div><p>And what if the environment is not a Linux computer? A pair
of good design choices and a small investment of your time can make
you a proficient user of the <b  >autoconf</b> package,
and your application can easily adapt to the following
environments:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>A Linux machine with gpm
installed.</b></span>  This is the best environment, and the
application will be compiled with full support, under both the
console and xterm. When invoked within a mouseless tty, the
application will run in keyboard-only mode without needing runtime
conditionals.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>A Linux machine without
gpm.</b></span>  If the application is distributed in binary form,
the gpm library will silently detect lack of the server and will
run in keyboard-only mode on the console. Under xterm everything
will work. If the application is distributed in source form, and
thus can't link in the gpm library, the following case will
apply.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Another Unix-like operating
system.</b></span>  The application will compile with xterm support
built in, because autoconf will include
<b  >gpm-xterm.c</b> in the set of files to be compiled.
This source replaces the most useful functions you find in libgpm
(that is, the open, close, and getc functions) and
<b  >Gpm_Repeat()</b>, a support function used to provide
event repetition while the button is kept pressed. The concept of
&ldquo;mouse handler&rdquo; will still work.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>A non-Unix operating
system.</b></span>  It seems like a lost battle... You have to
include a lot of conditionally compiled code anyway. Are you sure
you need a mouse-sensitive application? In any case, it will be no
harder than making any application portable between significantly
different operating systems.</p></li></ul></div><p>The code excerpts in Listings <a  href="#list1">1</a>
and <a  href="#list2">2</a> include the the relevant parts
of <b  >configure.in</b> and
<b  >Makefile.in</b> used to create the &ldquo;portable&rdquo;
sample application distributed within the gpm package. They are
reproduced here to give an idea of how easy it is to set up a
portable compilation environment. In fact, you needn't be an
autoconf expert to set up such an environment, because a little
documentation and good amount of cut and paste can easily
work.</p><p>This configure.in checks if <b  >Gpm_Repeat</b> is
found in libgpm and selects whether libgpm is linked in or
<b  >gpm-xterm.c</b> should be compiled. Note that the
high-level library, though not managed in this configure.in, is
independent of the low-level mechanisms, thus it can be included in
the portable application as well.</p><p><b  >Gpm_Repeat</b> is a software aid to repeating
events on a timely basis up to button release. It works also under
xterm and is used here as a test because it appeared only when the
library and server were quite stable. I presume you don't want to
link your application with libgpm 0.01, in the unfortunate case
that some early alpha tester has one lying around on his or her
hard drive.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1763580.0x1855598"></a>Is This Pain Worth the Effort?</h2></div></div><p>Before you actually start coding, however, it is worth
understanding the pros and cons of mouse programming using libgpm,
and being warned against common pitfalls.</p><p>If you need to write a friendly interface, using libgpm is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> difficult compared to writing a
<b  >Tk</b> script. If your interface is going to run on
a powerful workstation, you are better off running X-Windows and
Tk. Moreover, it is completely portable&mdash;free Macintosh and MS
Windows ports of Tk are in development.</p><p>If your application will run on a general-purpose workstation
which does not run X-Windows, you should take into account the
trend to upgrade existing hardware. Thus, if your application is a
medium- or long-term project, you might be better off to start with
Tk anyway.</p><p>But then, what applications need libgpm, if the author
himself discourages its use? As a simple rule, I suggest writing
text-only applications when you need to support the whole range of
Linux computers. System management tools are good candidates for
libgpm&mdash;remember that Linux-1.2 still runs happily with 2MB of RAM
and 10MB of disk.</p><p>Another field which could benefit from a simple
mouse-sensitive front end is the field of embedded systems and
dedicated machinery. For example, an inexpensive Linux box can be
used as an NFS (Network File System) or WWW server for a small
company, and usage reports will be queried by novice users.
Avoiding X-Windows and writing a gpm-based interface is a win
here.</p><p>If I've not discouraged you from using libgpm, go for it, but
remember to pay attention to portability, simplicity, and the
user's proficiency.</p><p>Portability is a major issue when developing a Unix
application. Particularly, remember to build a tty-independent
application&mdash;this means you must always provide a keyboard
alternative to mouse events. There are hundreds of tty types, and
you can't force a user to use the Linux console. Besides, a user
might need to drive your application in &ldquo;unsupervised mode&rdquo;
through stdin.</p><p>Another important issue is keeping it simple: don't depend on
things like pressing two buttons at once, for example, which won't
work under xterm.</p><p>Finally, remember that the user must
<span   class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> the mouse. You should redraw the mouse
cursor (possibly by means of <b  >Gpm_DrawPointer</b>)
after each write to the screen. This is important because users
tend to use the mouse for selecting text, and using a
mouse-sensitive application in the same way as
<b  >selection</b> can make for disasters.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1763580.0x1b690b8"></a>Where to Get the Software</h2></div></div><p>The gpm package is available by ftp from

<span   class="bold"><b>info</b></span> file and a PostScript manual
describing the library much more thoroughly. A sample portable
application is included as well.</p><p>The package is also distributed in binary form (but with the
full documentation) with Slackware. If you have had the Slackware
distribution through floppy disks, you may want to get the source;
otherwise it is in the cdrom. Recently, I've also heard a proposal
to &ldquo;debianize&rdquo; gpm, so it may appear in the Debian distribution
in the near future.</p><p>For any question not answered in the documentation, feel free
to contact me.</p><p><a name="list1"></a>Listing 1. Simple configure.in for a Mouse-Aware
