    Dan's previous article (<i  >Linux Journal</i> #14) explains why
    Eiffel is a language of great interest. In this article Dan
    reviews two Linux implementations of Eiffel-3.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2529580.0x2621298"></a></h2></div></div><p>The two packages reviewed, ISE Eiffel-3
from Interactive Software Engineering (ISE), of Santa Barbara,
California, and TowerEiffel from Tower Technology, of Austin,
Texas, have much in common, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A short &ldquo;Ace&rdquo; file that describes the makeup of a
system of classes comprising a program and that contains options to
the compiler, most critically, the name of the root class and its
creation procedure, and the class directories. Based on the Ace
file, the compiler handles all dependency analysis itself.</p></li><li><p>A command line interface (not evaluated in this
review). The graphical interfaces are nice, but not absolutely
needed, and you can get around them if you find they are getting in
your way.</p></li><li><p>Between 50KB and 100KB of static runtime binary
libraries. Both ISE and Tower Technology plan to offer shared
libraries in the ELF binary format when ELF stabilizes.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2529580.0x2621608"></a>Class Libraries</h2></div></div><p>Eiffel class libraries are delivered in source or sometimes
encrypted source form, with one file per class. Lots of classes are
present in such a library, offering things such as linked lists,
trees, file I/O, iterators, classes for object persistence and
transmission, and much more.</p><p>Except for the kernel library, which furnishes hooks to the
operating system and the runtime binary library, class libraries
are planned to be portable across compilers. With the adoption of
PELKS, the Proposed Eiffel Kernel Library Standard, all vendors now
move toward a common kernel library interface supporting their
other class libraries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2529580.0x2621768"></a>TowerEiffel</h2></div></div><p>The Tower development environment is tailored to lemacs or
its successor, xemacs. Neither is included in the distribution, but
these editors are are commonly available from ftp sites and
CD-ROMs. Look for lemacs-19.10 or xemacs-19.11. You can also use
emacs, though the fit is less precise.</p><p>Tower is working on a non-emacs integrated development
environment, to be in beta test by press time.</p><p>Installation was smooth, except for a little difficulty in
the license setup. After some exchange of e-mail, a working license
code was installed and TowerEiffel was up and running.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2529580.0x2621920"></a>Running TowerEiffel</h2></div></div><p>Program edit, class browsing, compilation, and debug are
initiated from lemacs pull-down menu selections. A nice touch is
the &ldquo;Send performance report to Tower&rdquo; menu item which e-mails a
bug report. I mailed some, and got immediate responses.</p><p>The &ldquo;Browse&rdquo; menu item gives you library browsing capability,
as well as allowing you to work with your own classes. Some very
useful views were missing from the menu. Tower agreed, and had
already implemented the most difficult of these. More choices will
soon be available.</p><p>With all optimizations enabled, a small test application
compiled from scratch in about one minute. The resulting binary
used about 77KB of code space. A rough breakdown of this showed
most of the code coming from the runtime library.</p><p>With all assertion checking on and no compiler optimizations,
the binary file from compiling this application occupied about a
megabyte. It still took one minute to compile from scratch.</p><p>Compiler errors list to a window, with explanations and
references to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eiffel: The Language</em></span>. If you
click on the errors, the related program text appears in another
window.</p><p>The Tower debugger, egdb, adapted from GNU gdb, is a
command-line symbolic debugger. <b  >Xemacs</b> or
<b  >xegdb</b> provide graphical front ends. Breakpoints
may be set at any reasonable line of the Eiffel source code. When
execution encounters a breakpoint the corresponding program text
appears in a window. You can single-step one Eiffel statement at a
time, and the cursor in the display window steps to the statement
executed. When execution enters C code functions, egdb becomes a C
source code debugger. All the other amenities familiar to gdb users
are present.</p><p>There were a few mysteries about how to display the contents
of some objects. Setting some breakpoints was also obscure. Other
than that, egdb was straightforward. Source code awareness was
good, and the ability to switch over to C mode was also nice, as
time-critical or platform dependent parts of Eiffel systems are
often implemented in C.</p><p>The TowerEiffel tools are rich in run-time options, not all
accommodated in the menus. In particular, report generating tools,
such as eshort, can produce output in text, LaTeX, plain roff,
manpage roff, or LaTeX, or Rich Text Format for use in Word or
NeXT. The options are well documented in <b  >man</b>
pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2529580.0x2621df0"></a>Tower Class Libraries</h2></div></div><p>The Tower class library has 102 classes, including the 47
kernel classes, providing the standard Eiffel language hooks into
the underlying runtime library and operating system, as well as
certain basic amenities, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>ANY</b></span>, the ancestor of all user
classes. Also present here are classes for strings, numbers,
arrays, and so on.</p><p>Another 22 encrypted classes comprise a subset of the Booch
components from Rational (Santa Clara, CA). These provide data
structure and support classes giving you containers, lists,
searching and sorting, pattern matching, and so on. Tower sells the
full set of Booch components in unencrypted form.</p><p>Finally, 16 classes provide for storage and transmission of
objects, and 10 more provide support functions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2529580.0x2622000"></a>Customer Service</h2></div></div><p>Tower staff were consistently prompt in responding to e-mail,
even when the answer to a question was not immediately available.
The longest delay between sending mail and receiving a response was
about four days, for a non-urgent matter. Most e-mail responses
were within 24 hours. I phoned Tower only twice, about matters
unrelated to any preceding e-mail. The person I wished to speak
with answered the phone himself the first time, and the second,
returned my call within a couple of hours.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2529580.0x2622108"></a>Interactive Software Engineering</h2></div></div><p>Interactive Software Engineering is the company of Bertrand
Meyer, Eiffel's designer.</p><p>Included with the pre-release document set I read were
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Eiffel: The Language,</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eiffel: The
Reference,</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eiffel: The Libraries,</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eiffel: The Environment,</em></span> all by Bertrand
Meyer.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Language</em></span> is the definitive work on
Eiffel, required reading for every Eiffel developer. Best read
after obtaining some initial familiarity with the language, it is
the language standard, and the place where all discussions of the
fine points turn for answers.</p><p>The remaining books are necessary if you plan to use the ISE
package, and are worthwhile reading in their own right. Bertrand
Meyer's writing is often entertaining, always very
insightful.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2529580.0x26224d0"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Interactive Software Engineering Eiffel-3 version 3.3.4 for
Linux arrived on a DAT tape. I took it over to the <i  >Linux Journal</i> offices to read it onto disk, then compressed it
to six floppies for <b  >klister</b> to read. Unpacking
was easy, and I filled out the registration form and sent it off by
e-mail. In due time the license codes arrived by return e-mail, I
installed them and fired up the license manager daemon, and ISE
Eiffel-3 was up and running.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2529580.0x2622688"></a>Running ISE Eiffel-3</h2></div></div><p>Program edit, class browsing, compilation, and debug are
performed from <b  >ebench</b> or the tools it launches.
These static linked Motif applications require no Motif shared
libraries.</p><p>The user interface is thoughtful and innovative. Many of the
things you need to do are initiated by pushbuttons or drag and
drop. Dragging is performed without holding down a button, by
clicking button three once to drag and again to drop, reducing the
carpal tunnel wear and tear. Drag is easily aborted by clicking
button 1. Pushbuttons have distinctive icons, and a phrase
describing each pushbutton appears in the tool frame when the
cursor is over the button. Those who have worked with graphical
tools will appreciate that multiple level menus, pop-ups, and
pull-downs are few. Instead, most of the controls needed at any
point are immediately available on the frames of the tools present
on the desktop.</p><p>You can edit program text using the native Motif
capabilities, or you can click on a button that launches your
favorite editor in a subshell. vi is the default editor. If you
prefer emacs, you might run it in its own window to avoid starting
it every time you want to edit a file.</p><p>ISE includes the following tools:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Project tool: Launch other tools, debug
programs.</p></li><li><p>System tool: Edit Ace file; look at system
statistics. Provide class names, for launching or targeting class
tools.</p></li><li><p>Class tool: Edit and browse classes.</p></li><li><p>Feature tool: Closer look at features, including
ancestry.</p></li><li><p>Object tool: Examine objects at debug time.</p></li><li><p>Explanation tool: Help on compilation errors</p></li></ul></div><p>The class, one of the more interesting tools, gives you
alternate views of a class at the push of a button. Views
include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Text: Editable class text.</p></li><li><p>Short: Feature definitions and feature header
comments.</p></li><li><p>Short flat: Short, with all ancestors rolled
in.</p></li><li><p>Ancestors: Indented list of all ancestors.</p></li><li><p>Descendents: Indented list of descendents.</p></li><li><p>Clients: List of all class clients in
system.</p></li><li><p>Suppliers: List of classes whose client the target
class is.</p></li></ul></div><p>And more. Within each of these views, many things can be
clicked and dragged to various tools. The effect is a very good
hypertext view of a system, including the supporting classes from
the libraries. Users of ctags may know what I mean if I call this
&ldquo;ctags on steroids&rdquo;.</p><p>My small test application took sixteen minutes to compile
from scratch with full optimizations and no assertions. The
resulting binary file was about 130KB.</p><p>With assertions enabled and optimizations off, full compile
time from scratch was about six minutes, and the binary file was
about 1.7MB.</p><p>ISE ebench uses &ldquo;melting ice technology&rdquo;, which allows
incremental changes to run in an interpreted mode. Only modified
classes are recompiled. Changing one class and clicking the Melt
button caused only a few seconds of compilation. The entire
application can be run in this mode, which runs slower but compiles
faster. My test application took 20 seconds to compile from scratch
in &ldquo;melt&rdquo; mode.</p><p>Compiler errors are shown in the project tool, whence you can
drag and drop class and feature names into class tools, letting you
find the affected program code quickly. For more information, drag
and drop the error code itself into an explanation tool, and very
likely you'll see a paragraph and page number from <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Language</em></span>.</p><p>Debug uses the same drag and drop technique used elsewhere.
Breakpoints can be set regardless of whether the system is
executing, in any class whose text is accessible to the tools. At
each breakpoint the stack frame is shown, and features may be
displayed by dragging from the stack frame to an object tool. Once
displayed, further references may be followed by dragging from the
object tool to itself. For example, to traverse a linked list, drag
its root object to an object tool, then repeatedly drag the forward
link to the same tool.</p><p>A breakpoint can be set only at a routine's entry point. As
most Eiffel routines are short, this gives better granularity than
a C source debugger able to break only at function entry points,
but can sometimes require insertion of feature calls and
recompilation. Single stepping is available, but I was unable to
discover any indication of which source statement had been reached
at a step.</p><p>The EiffelBench environment is a very nice piece of work. If
you are interested in integrated development environments, ISE
Eiffel-3 is worth the purchase price just to get a good look at
what they've done here. While not perfect, this environment gives a
stable, quick, and user friendly, but not confining, basis for
doing projects in Eiffel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2529580.0x2a1b850"></a>ISE Class Libraries</h2></div></div><p>The ISE class library is large, with 752 classes, all in
source form. Of these, the ones of most general interest will be
the 157 classes in the base hierarchy, comprising the kernel
classes, support classes, and containers and data structures.
Beyond that there are libraries for building parsers, GUIs under X,
Motif, or MS Windows, or for use in EiffelBuild, their Motif GUI
builder.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2529580.0x2a1b958"></a>Customer Service</h2></div></div><p>ISE gave a satisfactory response to every significant
question I have raised to date. Sometimes this required persistence
on my part, and once or twice it required a phone call to follow up
the e-mail.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Dan Wilder has been employed as a software
