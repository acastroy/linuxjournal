    Reuven shows how to develop your own simple web/database
    application using APM.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133d580.0x1435500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we continued our exploration
of OpenACS by looking at how individual applications are packaged
together using APM (the ArsDigita Package Manager). Every OpenACS
application normally combines database tables with server-side
programs, which means that installing or upgrading a package is
more complicated than copying some files. As we saw last month, the
APM application makes it relatively easy to install a package and
then instantiate it under one or more URLs.
</p><p>This is great if you care only about using existing APMs. But
most OpenACS installations will require new, custom packages that
have their own data models and programs. While it's theoretically
possible to develop OpenACS applications without APMs, doing so
makes it hard to distribute your software, track versions or
standardize your installation procedure.</p><p>This month, we cover how to develop our own simple
web/database application using APM. The final result is an
application that someone else can load into their OpenACS
system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133d580.0x14356b8"></a>Creating the Skeleton Package</h2></div></div><p>The first step in creating a new OpenACS application is
making a new skeleton package via the web-based APM program. By
default, this program is available only to the user with
administration rights to an OpenACS system, so you might need to
ask the administrator to modify the permissions when you begin your
development work.</p><p>On most OpenACS systems, you can launch the APM program via
the /acs-admin/apm/ URL. This program displays all of the installed
APMs, including each one's name, version and number of files it
includes. The file count normally includes .sql files (for creating
and removing database definitions), .tcl files (containing Tcl
program code), .adp files (for web templates similar to ASP or JSP)
and .xql files (containing SQL queries). However, an APM can
contain other files, including images, text files or even something
more unusual, such as Flash.</p><p>As we saw last month, we can use this screen as an entry
point to install, inspect and modify the packages on our system.
But if we go down to the bottom of this list and click the create a
new package link, we can begin the process of creating our own
application.</p><p>The initial &ldquo;create a package&rdquo; screen asks for a number of
parameters that will help APM create a .info file that describes
the package to the system. Assuming that we want to create a
&ldquo;hello, world&rdquo; application with a minimum amount of work, we can
fill in a small number of fields:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The package key should be atf-hello. There is no
namespace hierarchy for APMs, but most developers put their name
(or a similar identifying term) at the front of the package name to
avoid conflicts.</p></li><li><p>The package name can be Hello or anything else you
choose; it is used by developers to distinguish it from other
packages.</p></li><li><p>We are developing an application, not a
service.</p></li><li><p>Our version number is 0.1d, meaning that it's in
early stages of development.</p></li><li><p>You can fill out or ignore the summary and
description at your discretion. It's a good idea to fill these in
for actual applications, however.</p></li></ul></div><p>When finished, ensure that the &ldquo;write a package&rdquo; specifier
box is checked, and click the &ldquo;create package&rdquo; button at the
bottom of the page. You will be taken to the management screen for
this particular package. If you look in the packages subdirectory
on the filesystem where your OpenACS toolkit was installed, you'll
see an atf-hello directory, containing an atf-hello.info file in
the correct XML format.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133d580.0x1435ce8"></a>Create a Data Model</h2></div></div><p>Now that OpenACS recognizes our package, we can get to work
designing the data model for our package. As all experienced
web/database developers know, designing the tables is the hard
part; once you know how they will work, creating the applications
that add, delete and modify that data is pretty easy.</p><p>Our application will give us a simple guest book, in which
visitors to the site can enter comments on our page. (OpenACS comes
with a more general and powerful facility for doing this on any
page on the site, but we will ignore this in the interest of
learning how to create a package.) Our data model will look like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE atf_hello_postings (
  posting_id    SERIAL   NOT NULL,
  user_id       INTEGER  NOT NULL  REFERENCES users
                ON DELETE CASCADE
                ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  entry_date    TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL  DEFAULT NOW(),
  posting       TEXT     NOT NULL
                CHECK (posting &lt;&gt; ''),
  PRIMARY KEY(posting_id)
);
</pre><p>On a purely technical level, the previous table definition
probably looks reasonable to anyone who has worked with PostgreSQL
before. We set up posting_id as an integer primary key, user_id as
a foreign key, a timestamp field (containing date and time
information) and then a text field to contain the actual posting.
Notice how our table name begins with atf_hello, reflecting the
fact that it is in the atf-hello APM. Keeping table names
consistent with package names is a primitive form of namespace
management, but it works well enough if everyone sticks with it.
</p><p>The above works under PostgreSQL but isn't guaranteed to work
with Oracle. Given that the OpenACS community prides itself on
working transparently with both databases, what should we do to
avoid alienating our high-end colleagues?</p><p>The answer is that when installing the atf-hello package, APM
looks for a file named sql/atf-hello-create.sql. If such a file
exists, it is assumed to work on all support databases. If not, APM
looks for subdirectories named postgresql and oracle and executes
atf-hello-create.sql in the appropriate directory. So if your
system uses PostgreSQL, the above SQL would be saved in a file
named sql/postgresql/atf-hello-create.sql. Official OpenACS
packages are supposed to work with both Oracle and PostgreSQL out
of the box, which means that it's rare to find a package that works
with only one brand or the other. (The examples in this month's
column are guaranteed to work only with PostgreSQL, although
porting them to Oracle should not be too difficult.)</p><p>OpenACS also allows us to create a cleanup script, named
sql/PACKAGE-drop.sql, that removes all the tables and stored
procedures that the create script defined. We thus create a file
named sql/postgresql/atf-hello-drop.sql.</p><p>APM knows how to create the data model when a package is
first installed, but not when you're doing development work. So to
install atf-hello into the database, you'll need to handle it
manually:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
psql -f atf-hello-create.sql openacs4
</pre><p>Of course, this assumes that openacs4 is the name of your
OpenACS database, that the PostgreSQL server is running on the same
machine as the psql client and that your current user name has
access rights to that database.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133d580.0x1436108"></a>OpenACS Templating</h2></div></div><p>Now that our data model is installed, it's time to write an
application that uses it. OpenACS 4 introduced a new templating
system that builds upon ADP (the AOLserver equivalent of ASP or
JSP), which I have found to be one of the best parts of
OpenACS.</p><p>ASP-like pages are easier for nonprogrammers to understand
than standard server-side programs. However, hybrids of HTML and
programs tend to become bottlenecks, because the designer and
developer cannot work on the file simultaneously.</p><p>OpenACS templates are a refreshing solution to this problem.
We divide the page into two parts: one (the .tcl page) for the
programmer and the other (the .adp page) for the designer. The .tcl
page begins with a contract describing which values it expects to
receive, as well as which values it will provide to the ADP page.
The Tcl page ends with a call to ad_return_template, which looks
for an .adp page of the same name, substitutes variables
appropriately and then runs the ADP parser on the page.</p><p>The Tcl page can pass values to the ADP page in the form of
data sources, a fancy term for variable. If the Tcl page
says</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set five 5
</pre><p>the ADP page can retrieve this value anywhere by surrounding
the variable name with @ signs, as in @five@. If the variable five
has not been defined or exported in the page contract, OpenACS
produces a runtime error, complaining that no such variable exists.
</p><p>This splitting of responsibilities means that the designer
and programmer can work independently, so long as the agreed-to
interface described in the page contract (for Tcl page inputs and
outputs) remains intact.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133d580.0x1436420"></a>Create the Tcl Pages</h2></div></div><p>OpenACS comes with a large number of functions designed to
help programmers create HTML forms quickly and easily. For the
purposes of this introduction, we won't use these functions; we
will use simple, raw HTML instead.</p><p>Our application will consist of two URLs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>One will display the current entries in our
atf_hello_postings table, in chronological order, along with a form
for entering a new posting. We will use the OpenACS database API,
which is easier to use than the native AOLserver database API (and
frees us from having to worry about threads and database pooling),
to retrieve results from the database and stick them into a
multirow variable. This variable then will be passed as a data
source to the ADP page, where it will be displayed. The action for
this form will point to a second URL.</p></li><li><p>The other is the Tcl program that receives the HTML
form, enters a new row into the database and redirects people back
to the first page.</p></li></ul></div><p>In other words, we will need two Tcl pages and one ADP page
for our application. These will all go in the www subdirectory
under atf-hello; if that directory doesn't exist, create it,
double-checking that it is owned by the same user as AOLserver is
running.</p><p>The first Tcl page (posting.tcl), shown in Listing 1, expects
no parameters and exports a single data source named
<b  >postings</b>. The Tcl page begins with a call to
ad_page_contract, which allows us to comment on the owner and
purpose of the file (in the first parameter), the inputs we receive
(in the second parameter, blank posting.tcl) and the data sources
we export (in the third parameter, named properties for historical
reasons). The Tcl page ends with a call to ad_return_template,
which looks for an .adp file with the same name as the current .tcl
file.</p><p><a href="6337l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
posting.tcl</a></p><p>While each data source is really a simple Tcl variable, the
OpenACS templating system disguises the true nature of these
variables somewhat, assigning each data source a name and a type
(multirow, list, onevalue or onerow). In this particular case, our
postings data source is a multirow, which means it will contain
multiple result rows from our SELECT. The db_multirow procedure
takes three arguments: the name of the variable into which the rows
should be read, the name of the query and the SQL itself.</p><p>Named queries are both a blessing and a curse in OpenACS.
They are a blessing, in that they make it possible to work with
multiple databases by placing the query in an external .xql file
(XML-formatted files appropriate for particular databases). The
problem is that OpenACS first looks for an .xql file associated
with the query name, only looking at the SQL in your .tcl page if
no XML exists. Many beginning OpenACS programmers are surprised to
find that the system is ignoring their SQL modifications in the
.tcl page, looking instead at the .xql page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133d580.0x14369a0"></a>Create the ADP Page</h2></div></div><p>When posting.tcl ends by invoking ad_return_template, the
OpenACS templating system looks for posting.adp. Because our Tcl
page contained all of the Tcl program code, we don't need the
standard &lt;% %&gt; tags in our ADP page. However, we do need a
way to translate our data source into something usable within
HTML.</p><p><a href="6337l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.
posting.adp</a></p><p>Shown in Listing 2 (posting.adp), the OpenACS templating
system adds a few tags that make it possible to retrieve the values
set in the .tcl page in a straightforward way:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>We can include HTML conditionally in the output
page by using an &lt;if&gt; tag, which compares (using eq and ne)
two values. In posting.adp, we compare the number of rows in the
postings data source (by querying @postings:rowcount@) with 0. If
there are no rows to display, then we show nothing at all.</p></li><li><p>If there are rows to display, we iterate through
them with the &lt;multiple&gt; tag. Within the &lt;multiple&gt; tag
block, we can retrieve individual database columns with the
@NAME.column@ syntax, as you can see in posting.adp.</p></li></ul></div><p>Regardless of how many rows we display, posting.adp always
includes a small HTML form that sends its contents to the
posting-add program. This program, posting-add.tcl (shown in
Listing 3), starts with an ad_page_contract that declares a single
input variable (posting_text). Input variables are mandatory by
default, although we can declare them as optional or assign a
default value by modifying the entry in ad_page_contract. In this
particular case, we ask OpenACS to remove any leading or trailing
whitespace from the text input we receive.</p><p><a href="6337l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.
posting-add.tcl</a></p><p>We then retrieve the current user ID using the built-in
ad_get_user_id procedure, assigning that to the user_id variable.
Next, we use db_dml to insert the posting into the database. Notice
how we use colons (rather than dollar signs) before the variable
names in db_dml; this is standard in the OpenACS database API and
ensures that we will not encounter quoting problems when passing
data to the database server.</p><p>Finally, posting-add.tcl ends by redirecting the user to
posting, which invokes posting.tcl and displays posting.adp.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133d580.0x142d7b0"></a>Finishing the Package</h2></div></div><p>We can now return to APM and generate a package with our
templates and database creation scripts. Click on the atf-hello
package name, and then click on the manage file information link
toward the bottom of the page. Now click on scan for additional
files in this package. You should see a list of the .sql, .tcl and
.adp pages we installed. Indicate that all of these files should be
included in the package, and after returning to the main ATF Hello
APM management screen, click on the generate a new atf-hello.info
file link.</p><p>You're now set to create an APM that can be distributed to
any other OpenACS user. Click on the generate a file link, and the
distribution file information will indicate the size of the
generated APM. If you click on this link, an APM should be
downloaded to your system.</p><p>How do you install a new APM someone has sent you? The
easiest method is to place the APM on the server filesystem. Then
from within your web browser, return to the main APM page
(/acs-admin/apm/) and click on the install link. Tell the system
where the APM is located, and it will be placed under the packages
directory. You will then be able to install it using the APM
installer that we examined last month. The data model will be
inserted into the database, and the web pages will be made
available for any interested parties. And of course, once a package
is installed in the system, you can use the ACS site map
application to mount a new instance of the package under a URL of
your choice.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133d580.0x142d968"></a>What Are We Missing?</h2></div></div><p>This example package only scratches the surface of OpenACS
application development, for example:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The templating system comes with an automatic
form-builder system that makes it easy to create HTML forms that
automatically provide confirmation screens and data
validation.</p></li><li><p>We can load Tcl procedures into AOLserver at
startup time by defining them within the package's tcl
directory.</p></li><li><p>Named SQL queries, as mentioned above, make it
possible to write a single Tcl program that transparently accesses
both Oracle and PostgreSQL.</p></li><li><p>Each instance of a package can be kept separate
from its peers using the OpenACS concept of context.</p></li><li><p>Each instance can set its own parameters, allowing
it to have installation-specific information.</p></li><li><p>Each package can define (or use) its own set of
permissions, allowing you to create custom permissions and custom
access control lists for users and groups on the system.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x133d580.0x142dee8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>OpenACS is complex, and APM is not the simplest system to
learn because it tries to handle so many complicated cases that
web/database developers often encounter. At the same time, I
haven't yet seen an easier way to distribute web/database
applications with this degree of modularity, portability across
databases and flexibility when it comes to the templates. The ease
of creating such applications, combined with a rich data model and
a large set of established applications makes OpenACS a viable and
useful platform for on-line communities.</p></div></div>
