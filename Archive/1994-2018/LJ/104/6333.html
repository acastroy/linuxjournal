    Mick shows you how to add a layer of security between the
    bad guys and your public FTP servers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x25873f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Running a public FTP site securely can be
difficult. Taking full advantage of the security features supported
by your FTP server application of choice can be a chore, and even
then there's a good chance that sooner or later vulnerabilities
will come to light making all that work for naught. So what else
can you do?
</p><p>One important technique is to run an FTP proxy on your
firewall. Whereas the standard Netfilter code in the Linux kernel
only inspects packets, an FTP proxy lets your firewall act as an
intermediary in all FTP transactions. This increases your
protection against buffer overflows and many other kinds of FTP
attacks. It also allows you to restrict which FTP commands are
executed by FTP clients.</p><p>This month I explain how to run SuSE's free (and
non-SuSE-Linux-specific) Proxy-Suite FTP proxy on your Linux
firewall, adding transparent but strong protection to all your FTP
transactions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x25875b0"></a>Getting and Installing proxy-suite</h2></div></div><p>If you run SuSE Linux, you can install the package
proxy-suite, which installs a binary copy of ftp-proxy along with
its configuration file and startup script. If you wish to use
ftp-proxy as a transparent proxy, or if you want ftp-proxy to
perform LDAP authentication, you'll need the latest version (1.9 as
of this writing).</p><p>To run the latest version or use ftp-proxy on non-SuSE
distributions, your best bet is to compile it yourself from source
code, available at
<a href="ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/proxy-suite/src" target="_self">ftp.suse.com/pub/projects/proxy-suite/src</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x2587768"></a>Building from Source</h2></div></div><p>Complete instructions on building and installing ftp-proxy
are provided in the file INSTALL. By default, the configure script
will check for libwrap, libldap and whether your system supports
regular expressions. On my Red Hat 7.3 system, libwrap was present
but caused a compile-time error, so I disabled libwrap like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ./configure --without-libwrap
</pre><p>and ftp-proxy compiled properly. However, this wasn't
necessary when I compiled ftp-proxy on my SuSE 7.1 system
(obviously, SuSE's and Red Hat's libwrap packages differ).
</p><p>After building ftp-proxy and installing it and its
documentation, you'll probably want a startup script for your new
proxy. Included with ftp-proxy's source (in the directory
ftp-proxy/) is a sample script, rc.script, which is explained in
the accompanying file rc.script.txt.</p><p>On SuSE systems, you simply can copy rc.script to /etc/init.d
and optionally create a symbolic link to it from /usr/sbin. Rename
the script /etc/init.d/ftp-proxy, and name the symbolic link
/usr/sbin/rcftp-proxy. If you run SuSE 7.x, you'll also need to add
this line to /etc/rc.config:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
START_FTP_PROXY="yes"
</pre><p>For non-SuSE distributions, the example rc.script will need
to be heavily tweaked, because much of it is SuSE-specific. Look at
other scripts in your distribution's init.d directory for examples.
Once you've figured out how, I strongly encourage you to send your
hacked script to Marius Tomaschewski
(<a href="mailto:mt@suse.de">mt@suse.de</a>), one of the
major contributors to FTP-Proxy, so others may benefit from your
brilliance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x2587ad8"></a>Configuring ftp-proxy</h2></div></div><p>Once you've installed ftp-proxy from source or from a SuSE
package, it's time to configure it. Most configurable parameters
are kept in /etc/proxy-suite/ftp-proxy.conf (or, if you installed
from source, in /usr/local/etc/proxy-suite/ftp-proxy.conf). Before
diving into ftp-proxy.conf, however, you've got a couple of odds
and ends to attend to.</p><p>First, you need a new, unprivileged user account for the
proxy d&aelig;mon to use. On my system I created such a user,
ftpproxy, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# useradd -u 65500 -g nogroup -d
/var/ftp-proxy/rundir -s /bin/false ftpproxy
</pre><p>No one should log in as this user, so be sure also to put an
asterisk in the password field of the proxy user's line in
/etc/shadow:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ftpproxy:*:12345:0:99999:7:0::
</pre>


Next, you'll need to build a chroot jail in which ftp-proxy's child
processes can work. For SuSE users this is easy; ftp-proxy's
startup script will do this for you if invoked with the chroot
command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-# /etc/init.d/ftp-proxy chroot
</pre>


Even if you don't run SuSE, it's fairly simple to reverse engineer
the example script (the rc.script mentioned earlier) to figure out
how to do this. The long and short of it is that the customary
ftp-proxy chroot jail is /var/ftp-proxy/rundir, and it should
contain copies of the libraries and files ftp-proxy uses, plus its
own dev/log special file to which your local syslog d&aelig;mon can
listen.
</p><p>To point your syslog d&aelig;mon to the chrooted log device,
simply add an -a parameter to its startup script so that syslog is
started:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
syslog -a /var/ftp-proxy/rundir/dev/log
</pre><p>On SuSE systems the customary way to do this is in
/etc/rc.config via the SYSLOGD_PARAMS variable. You can specify
multiple -a statements if, for example, you're also receiving logs
from a chrooted named.
</p><p><a href="6333s1.html" target="_self">Firewall Primers</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x2587f50"></a>ftp-proxy.conf</h2></div></div><p>And now, finally, it's time to configure your proxy
d&aelig;mon. As I mentioned, this is done in the file
ftp-proxy.conf, which resides either in /etc/proxy-suite or in
/usr/local/etc/proxy-suite. You may be confused or annoyed by
SuSE's use of the term &ldquo;suite&rdquo; to refer to a single application.
Hopefully, additional proxies will be completed soon, and if
they're as useful as ftp-proxy, I, for one, will forgive them for
this minor conceit.</p><p>The quickest way to explain this file is to list a brief
example and dissect it (see Listing 1).</p><p><a href="6333l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
ftp-proxy.conf</a></p><p>The first parameter, ServerType, determines whether to run
ftp-proxy as a standalone d&aelig;mon or from inetd. Although I've
been calling it a d&aelig;mon, ftp-proxy can be run either way. I
personally avoid running inetd or even xinetd on my public servers,
because that way I don't need to disable the unnecessary things
that tend to get run by default, and because of the performance
benefit of running things as d&aelig;mons. If your needs are
different, you can set ServerType to inetd (which also works if you
run xinetd rather than inetd).</p><p>User and Group, obviously enough, determine the UID and GID
under which ftp-proxy runs after initialization. It's a good idea
to set these to an unprivileged UID and GID in order to lessen the
consequences of an attacker somehow hijacking an ftp-proxy
process.</p><p>LogDestination specifies where ftp-proxy should send log
messages. This can be either d&aelig;mon (the local syslog
facility), a file or a pipe. LogLevel determines the quantity of
information to be logged; for most users the default of INF is
best, but DBG (the maximum setting) is useful for
troubleshooting.</p><p>PidFile tells ftp-proxy where to store the process ID of its
master process. This is used by the startup script when it's
invoked with the stop command and upon system halt. It isn't used,
however, if ftp-proxy is run in inetd mode.</p><p>ServerRoot specifies the path to ftp-proxy's chroot jail.
Leave it commented out if you don't want to run ftp-proxy chrooted
(see the &ldquo;Problem with 1.9 and chroot&rdquo; Sidebar).</p><p><a href="6333s2.html" target="_self">Problems with 1.9 and
chroot</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x25883c8"></a>Transparent Proxying</h2></div></div><p>The next three commands in Listing 1 are important. They
determine whether your proxy will be transparent. In most
situations, a transparent proxy is preferable. End users won't need
to configure their FTP client software to explicitly support the
proxy. To achieve this, ftp-proxy works in conjunction with the
kernel's Netfilter code, which redirects FTP packets to your proxy
d&aelig;mon rather then sending them to the host to which they're
actually addressed.</p><p>When ftp-proxy receives FTP client packets that have been
redirected in this way, it uses their destination IP as the
destination of the new FTP connection it initiates to the desired
FTP server. The parameter DestinationAddress specifies the default
destination to use.</p><p>If you want to allow users to use the proxy
non-transparently, i.e., by initiating their FTP sessions directly
to the proxy, set the parameter AllowMagicUser to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but I do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> recommend doing so if your proxy is to be
used by external users, as in the case of a public FTP.
AllowMagicUser will cause your proxy to act as an open proxy that
external users may use to connect to <span   class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>external</em></span> FTP servers, possibly for the purpose
of attacking them.</p><p>If you've configured Netfilter to accept connections to the
proxy from trusted (internal) users only, however, and you set
AllowMagicUser to &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, users will be able to specify their FTP
destination by attaching it to their user name with an @ sign,
e.g., mick@ftp.wiremonkeys.org. AllowMagicUser may be used
regardless of whether AllowTransProxy is set to yes or no. But note
that if it's set to no and AllowMagicUser is too,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> FTP sessions will use
DestinationAddress.</p><p>Other parameters include MaxClientsString and
DestinationTransferMode. See the ftp-proxy.conf(8) man page for the
complete list and for more information on the ones we've covered
here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x2588790"></a>Configuring Netfilter for Transparent
Proxying</h2></div></div><p>For transparent proxying to work you need to use iptables to
redirect FTP packets to the local proxy (i.e., you need to run
Netfilter on your proxy host, which this article assumes you're
doing), and of course, you'll need rules allowing FTP connections
to and from the proxy. You will <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>, however,
need any rules in the FORWARD chain.</p><p>First, you'll need to load several modules for your Linux 2.4
firewall to support transparent proxying: ipt_conntrack_ftp and
ip_nat_ftp are required for FTP connection tracking; ipt_REDIRECT
is required for the REDIRECT rule target. Most distributions' stock
2.4 kernels include these modules.</p><p>Once the modules are loaded, you can add firewall rules like
these to your Netfilter startup script (Listing 2).</p><p><a href="6333l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. iptables: Commands for
Transparent FTP Proxying</a></p><p>The first two commands of Listing 2, instruct the firewall to
redirect all packets received on its external and internal
interfaces (eth2 and eth0, respectively) that have a destination
port of TCP 21 (the FTP server port). Note that these packets won't
be rewritten (mangled) in any way; they'll simply be redirected to
the local FTP proxy d&aelig;mon.</p><p>The third and fourth commands in Listing 2 tell the firewall
to accept all incoming packets sent to TCP port 21 of the public
FTP server (where the variable PUBLIC_FTP contains its IP address)
and all incoming FTP packets sent by internal users (where the
variable INTERNAL_HOSTS contains an IP range in CIDR notation,
e.g., 192.168.99.0/24). Per the first two lines, any packets
matching lines three and four will be diverted to the local
proxy.</p><p>The fifth and sixth lines in Listing 2 allow the local
ftp-proxy d&aelig;mon to initiate proxied FTP connections to the
specified public FTP server and to external FTP servers (i.e.,
hosts reachable from its external Ethernet interface, in this
example, eth2).</p><p>The lines in Listing 2 do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> form a
self-contained Netfilter rulebase. They represent the lines you
could add to an existing script already properly configured for
NAT, etc., and already containing definitions for the variables
PUBLIC_FTP and INTERNAL_HOSTS. It's good practice to use custom
variables like this to make your rules more readable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x2588c08"></a>Restricting FTP Commands</h2></div></div><p>Now we return to ftp-proxy.conf (Listing 1) and one of
ftp-proxy's most important features: ValidCommands. This is a
comma-delimited list of FTP commands the proxy will allow. The list
may span multiple lines if you end each line (except for the last)
with a backslash (\). In the ValidCommands statement at the bottom
of Listing 1, ftp-proxy has been configured to allow FTP directory
navigation commands (PWD, CWD, CDUP) and FTP read commands (LIST,
NLST, RETR), plus some additional administrative commands such as
MODE, PORT and PASV.</p><p>Space does not permit me to explain all of these in depth,
other than to say that these aren't end-user FTP client commands;
they're FTP protocol commands as specified in RFC 959 (see
<a href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc959.txt" target="_self">ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc959.txt</a>).
These are the commands that FTP client and server applications use
with each other. See Table 1 for a summary.</p><p><a href="6333t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. FTP Commands Specified by
RFC 959</a></p><p>One limitation of ftp-proxy is that it isn't possible to set
different command restrictions for external users than for internal
users. Be careful, therefore, with ValidCommands. If your internal
users need to send files to FTP servers, you won't be able to
restrict the STOR or STOU commands (i.e., you'll need to include
them in ValidCommands), which means you'll need to make sure your
read-only public FTP server is itself configured to disregard
them.</p><p>That isn't such a bad thing. Regardless of how ftp-proxy is
configured, you still need to configure your FTP servers to protect
<span   class="emphasis"><em>themselves</em></span> as much as possible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x248f580.0x29811c8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>An FTP proxy adds an important layer of security between the
bad guys and your public FTP servers. I've shown you the basics of
setting up a transparent FTP proxy using SuSE's proxy-suite, but it
supports many other worthwhile features we haven't covered here.
