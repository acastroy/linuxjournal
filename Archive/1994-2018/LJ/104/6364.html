    An overview of the current issue.

old days, there used to be a marketing document called a &ldquo;road
map&rdquo;. Information technology vendors would come down from on high
and declare that during some quarter of next year, they would allow
customers to start doing some task with their product, so customers
should buy stuff now and it will work sometime in the future.
</p><p>The theme of this issue is system administration, so here's a
better road map for you. Go to
<a href="http://maps.yahoo.com" target="_self">maps.yahoo.com</a>, and fill
in 327 Ley Road, Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA. That's the address of
Midwest Tool &amp; Die, where our authors Craig Swanson and Matt
Lung work. As you might expect, MTD is the very model of a modern
manufacturer, with an ISO 9002 ce.pngication and a quality award
from the State of Indiana, but they're also doing something that
just might make it worth the 35 hours and 42 minutes Yahoo says it
will take to get there from Silicon Valley. They're drawing their
own road map.</p><p>Three years ago, MTD faced the need for a shared company
directory and addressed it with OpenLDAP, Samba and other
customer-friendly software (page 48). Instead of following a
top-down road map from a single vendor, they made things work their
way. Although one of MTD's secret weapons is a close working
relationship with nearby engineering powerhouse Purdue University,
companies are following similar strategies both in-house and in
partnership with IT services firms large and small.</p><p>Here in Silicon Valley, it's starting to become apparent that
the main reason for the so-called tech downturn is that all this
stuff just started working. When your file server is fast and
reliable, your client systems are capable, and the operating system
is stable, you don't need to upgrade in search of a fix. Now that
&ldquo;tech&rdquo; isn't a money pit you have to struggle with, you can
really start to get some use out of it, and that's only a downturn
if your business is selling flakiness. For those of us who actually
get some use out of systems, it's a win.</p><p>LDAP is a central directory that doesn't put harsh demands on
other server software and works with pretty much anything. Of
course, the more stuff you put on your company LDAP server, the
worse it is when it goes down. Jay Allen and Cliff White explain a
simple way to keep LDAP going, no matter what happens to the master
server (page 58).</p><p>If you're new to system administration and interested in who
ran what, when&mdash;whether for security, improving service to the
users or some other reason&mdash;check out Keith Gilbertson's article on
page 66. Process accounting is an old-school UNIX feature, and it
might just be on the certification exam.</p><p>No matter how much attention HTTP gets, FTP refuses to die,
and Mick Bauer explains how to protect your inside FTP server from
the outside on page 32. There's plenty of other good stuff in this
issue, so wash the whiteboard, grab your business requirements and
draw your own road map.</p></div></div>
