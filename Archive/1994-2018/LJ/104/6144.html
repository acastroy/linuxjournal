    One notch in your security belt, maybe for tracking gaming
    time, here's some basic how-tos.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c9580.0x27c1500"></a></h2></div></div><p>While on site at a Fortune 500
corporation recently, I overheard a tech support person whispering
excitedly to a project manager, &ldquo;Don't play any games on your PC!
The corporate auditors have a way to find out exactly what programs
you use and for how long!&rdquo;
</p><p>After loudly assuring the techie that he was all business and
didn't intend to play games anyway, the manager smiled. Then in a
much quieter tone he said he needn't be concerned; he was using
Linux and not Windows, unlike most of the company.</p><p>If the tech's tale is true, the manager may indeed have
reason for concern. Although the rumoured auditing application at
this particular company was developed for Windows, the Linux kernel
has a built-in process accounting facility. It allows system
administrators to collect detailed information in a log file each
time a program is executed on a Linux system. With this capability,
our mythical corporate auditor could, in fact, collect information
about who has been playing games on a Linux computer and for how
long.</p><p>Although a company's interest in knowing which employees have
been indulging in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Solitaire</em></span> on company
equipment is of questionable merit, there are good reasons to use
process accounting (PA). In this article, I discuss some situations
where process accounting is useful, explain where to obtain and how
to use the standard process accounting commands, and then
demonstrate how to use the process accounting structure and system
call in C programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c9580.0x27c1768"></a>Preliminaries</h2></div></div><p>I assume that your system has process accounting support
compiled into the kernel. I make this assumption because the
kernels on all of the Linux systems I have had access to are
configured to allow process accounting, but your distribution may
be different. If you compile and run the first code listing in this
article as root with no command-line arguments but receive an error
message, it is likely that process accounting support is not
included in your kernel. You'll need to compile a new kernel and
answer yes to CONFIG_BSD_PROCESS_ACCOUNTING, which is the BSD
Process Accounting item in the General Setup menu. Recompiling your
kernel is beyond the scope of this article, but instructions can be
found at the Linux Documentation Project
(<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html" target="_self">www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html</a>).</p><p>On busy systems, keep in mind that turning on process
accounting requires significant disk space. On my Pentium III
system with Red Hat 7.2, each time a program is executed, 64 bytes
of data are written to the process accounting log file. While
researching this article and running the process accounting
utilities on a test machine with low disk space, I discovered a
monitor process that executes every second. The drive on that
machine filled up quickly. Some server's d&aelig;mons will initiate
a separate process for each incoming connection. On a production
server that executes nearly 25,000 processes per hour,
approximately 1.1GB of process accounting data is generated each
month. Utilities, such as the accttrim and handleacct.sh script
listed in Table 1, are available to truncate, back up and compress
log files at regular intervals. If you plan on doing process
accounting on a busy system, it will be important for you to learn
about and use these utilities.</p><p>Finally, know that you must have root privileges on your
Linux system to enable or disable process accounting, whether using
the standard commands or creating your own.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c9580.0x27c1978"></a>Uses of Process Accounting</h2></div></div><p>One of the earliest uses of process accounting was to
calculate the CPU time absorbed by users at computer installations
and then bill users accordingly. With the greater abundance and
relatively low expense of today's computing resources, this
application has fallen by the wayside. If the distributed computing
model catches on, however, this application could again become
important.</p><p>System administrators may wish to use data collected from the
PA facilities to monitor which programs are most accessed by users,
and then optimize the system configuration for these types of
programs. For example, part of the data collected by the PA
facilities includes the number of bytes that are input and output
by the program and the CPU usage. A system that runs a high
percentage of I/O-intensive applications may need to be optimized
in ways that a system running a high percentage of CPU-bound
applications not.</p><p>At some point an administrator might be required to evaluate
two products with similar functionality. Let's imagine that before
making a selection, the administrator wishes to see which fish
forecasting product the people are actually using. To do this,
process accounting can be turned on for a week to record the names
of all the commands executed in a log file. The administrator can
then parse the log file to find out which command was run more
often.</p><p>The most typical application of process accounting is as a
supplement to system security measures. In the case of a break-in
on a company server, the log files created by the process
accounting facility are useful for collecting forensic evidence. A
careful look at the programs an attacker has used on the
compromised system can provide useful information about the damage
done, as well as the intruder's methods and possible motivations.
Evidence collected from the process accounting logs also may be
helpful in court. I know of one criminal case in which this data,
when uncontested by the defendant, led to a misdemeanor
conviction.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c9580.0x27c1b88"></a>Standard Process Accounting Commands</h2></div></div><p>Even if process accounting facilities have been compiled into
your kernel, you might not have the user commands for process
accounting installed on your system. If this is the case, and
you're looking to get started quickly, first try finding the
process accounting commands for your specific Linux
distribution.</p><p>The package for your distribution likely is configured to
place log files in the appropriate location for your system's
setup, making installation much simpler. On my Red Hat 7.2
distribution CDs, I found the ps-acct-6.3.2-9.i386.rpm on the
second disk, in the directory. If you use the gnorpm graphical
install tool, the package will appear in the
Packages/Applications/System hierarchy. On a Debian system, install
the acct package.</p><p>If you're installing from source, two versions of the
utilities are available. One version, under the BSD license, is
available at
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/admin/accounts" target="_self">www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/admin/accounts</a>.
The filename will be similar to acct-1.3.73.tar.gz, with small
differences depending on the version number. In order to get these
utilities to compile on my system, I had to edit the lastcomm.c
file and comment out the prototype for the strcpy function.</p><p>There is also a process accounting utilities set written by
Noel Cragg and licensed under the GNU GPL. It's available at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/System_administration/Monitoring/acct.html" target="_self">www.gnu.org/directory/System_administration/Monitoring/acct.html</a>.</p><p>The exact process accounting commands installed on your
system will vary depending on the particular package you've chosen.
Table 1 shows a list of the commands you could encounter and the
purpose of each.</p><p><a href="6144t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Process Accounting
Commands</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c9580.0x27c1f50"></a>Installation of the GNU Accounting
Utilities</h2></div></div><p>Let's take a quick look at how to install the GNU Accounting
Utilities on a system. Use the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar zxvf acct_6.3.5.orig.tar.gz
cd acct-6.3.5
./configure
make
su
make install
</pre><p>A few basic process accounting commands have now been
installed on your system. You're now ready to turn on the
accounting and start using the commands.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c9580.0x27c2108"></a>Using the Utilities</h2></div></div><p>In this brief introduction to using the process accounting
commands, I look at two commands, accton and lastcomm. I've chosen
these two commands because they are standard on all process
accounting versions.</p><p>The accton command switches process accounting on or off. If
a filename is specified on the command line, that filename will be
used to log the process accounting information. If no argument is
specified, process accounting will be switched off.</p><p>To start the process accounting facilities on your system,
<b  >su</b> to become root. Make sure that the log file
exists by performing a <span   class="bold"><b>touch</b></span> on
the desired location. Example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
touch  /var/log/pacct
</pre><p>Then type the full path to your accton program (usually
/usr/sbin/accton or /sbin/accton) followed by the filename.
Example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/accton /var/log/pacct
</pre>


You've just started the process accounting facilities. Note that
the data actually is not added to the file when each process begins
execution; it is written when a process exits. The aforementioned
project manager can play the <span   class="emphasis"><em>xbill</em></span> game all
day long and not have this information written to the process
accounting file, as long as he never exits the program. When he
goes home at night, he can choose to leave
<span   class="emphasis"><em>xbill</em></span> running and minimize the window, or he
can simply power off his computer without performing a proper
shutdown.
</p><p>Now that you've switched on the accounting, run a few normal
commands as an ordinary user to get some data for the lastcomm
command, which you'll use next. When you're finished,
<b  >su</b> to root once more, and run
<b  >/usr/sbin/accton</b> or
<b  >/sbin/accton</b> with no arguments to switch off
process accounting.</p><p>The lastcomm command prints information contained in the
accounting log files, with the most recent record printed first.
You can use the -f command-line option to specify a filename.
Typically, the process accounting log file on a system is set up so
that only root can read it. This command is then executed by root,
for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lastcomm -f /var/log/pacct
</pre><p>When you type in the above command, the output is similar to
this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
id         root   stdin  0.00 secs Mon Jul 22 12:41
xauth   S  root   stdin  0.00 secs Mon Jul 22 12:41
xauth   S  keithg stdin  0.00 secs Mon Jul 22 12:41
xauth   S  keithg stdin  0.01 secs Mon Jul 22 12:41
bubbles  X keithg ??     0.01 secs Mon Jul 22 12:33
ls         keithg ??     0.01 secs Mon Jul 22 12:26
bash     X keithg ??     0.03 secs Mon Jul 22 08:25
</pre>


<span   class="bold"><b>lastcomm</b></span> displays the command
name, options, user name, terminal and exit time for each command.
A particular command, user or terminal also can be specified on the
command line. For example, if you want to find instances only of
when the su program was started, you can type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
lastcomm -f /var/log/pacct --command su
</pre>


Now you'll see output like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
su      root     ??      0.01 secs Mon Jul 22 10:52
su      keithg   stdout  0.05 secs Mon Jul 22 09:32
su      keithg   stdout  0.00 secs Mon Jul 22 09:17
su      root     ??      0.00 secs Mon Jul 22 03:29
su      keithg   tty1    0.00 secs Sun Jul 21 19:49
</pre>


Notice that on each line, the command listed in the left column is
now su. For more details about these commands and the other
programs in the table, see the respective man pages.

is documented in the header files /usr/include/linux/acct.h and
/usr/include/sys/acct.h. Table 2 displays the members available in
the acct struct and a brief description of each member.</p><p><a href="6144t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Members in the acct
struct</a></p><p>As you can see from the table, a lot of information is packed
into the 64-byte accounting record. If you feel you need more
information than is available with standard process accounting,
consult the book by Mann and Mitchell listed in Resources at the
end of this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c9580.0x27c2b00"></a>Example Programs</h2></div></div><p></p><p><a href="6144l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Enabling and Disabling
Accounting to a File</a></p><p>Listing 1 is a simple demonstration of the use of the acct
system call. The acct call takes one argument, the name of the file
to which process accounting information is appended. If the
argument is NULL, process accounting will be turned off. In
addition, the file already must exist when the system call is made,
or the call will fail and an error will be returned.</p><p>If a program running with the ID of an ordinary user makes a
call to acct, the call also will fail and return an error. Programs
that attempt to switch process accounting on and off must have root
privileges to succeed.</p><p>The code in Listing 1 is similar to a typical implementation
of the accton command, but there are two main differences. The
first is that this code will report its actions in messages to
standard output. The second is that if the file specified on the
command line does not exist, it will be created.</p><p>The file includes the &lt;unistd.h&gt; header file. All
programs that make use of the acct call should include this file.
The program checks to see if argc is equal to one, meaning no
arguments were passed on the command line. If this is so, the
program attempts to turn off process accounting by calling acct
with a NULL argument.</p><p>If the command is run with an argument, the program will
assume that the first argument is the filename. If the file does
not exist, the program will attempt to create it with the creat
system call. Then, the program will call acct with the filename as
an argument to turn on process accounting. If an error code is
returned from a system call, a message will be printed and the
program will exit.</p><p><a href="6144l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Parsing the Accounting
File</a></p><p>Listing 2 demonstrates how to read records from the log file
into an acct structure in memory so that the information can be
printed out or operated upon. This program includes the
&lt;sys/acct.h&gt; header file. All programs that need to work with
the acct structure should include this file. Local variables in the
main function include a file descriptor, a variable to hold the
number of bytes read from the file and an acct struct.</p><p>The user of the program must specify a filename on the
command line. The program attempts to open this file for read-only
access. If the open was successful, the program will read() a
record from the file directly into the local acct structure, a. Due
to space constraints for the article, I've made the assumption that
a read() always will return exactly the number of bytes requested,
until the end of file is reached. The program continues to read and
print the command name from the records until a zero is returned
from the read() call, signalling the end of file condition.</p><p>The Listings in this article are intended to be simple
introductions to the system accounting structures. Robust programs
would create a buffer to read multiple accounting records at once,
and they would check for issues such as fewer bytes read from the
file than were requested. To see examples of robust programs, look
at the source for the process accounting utilities that you've
installed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c9580.0x2bbb278"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>You now have enough information to enable process accounting
and use the standard commands to retrieve information about
programs executed on a Linux system. If you're so inclined, you
also can learn to make custom tools that parse the process
accounting log files.</p><p>If you're using process accounting for system security, keep
in mind that it is not by any means a comprehensive solution, but
only one small tool. In fact, as Mann and Mitchell point out, you
should be careful about trusting the information in the process
accounting log files; the logs may have been modified by a
technically savvy attacker.</p><p>With a basic understanding of the process accounting tools in
Linux and some experimentation, you can set up these utilities on
your own computer. If you're fortunate enough to have root access
to the systems at work, you'll also be prepared to remove all
traces of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sokoban</em></span> game from the accounting
log files&mdash;in case that evil corporate auditor really does show up
in your department one day.</p><p><a href="6144s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
