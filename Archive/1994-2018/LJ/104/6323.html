    On the question of making illegal copies of proprietary
    software&mdash;why should we care?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfcf580.0x10c75b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>My editor asked me an embarrassingly
difficult question a while back and I've been struggling for an
answer. It forced me to consider questions of ethics as well as
law. He asked, &ldquo;What should a system administrator do when he
discovers that others in his company are making illegal copies of
licensed software?&rdquo;
</p><p>Under the laws of most states, nobody has a duty to be a good
samaritan. You may remember the Biblical parable of the passerby
who came to the aid of a Jew who had been robbed, beaten and left
to die on the roadside. The kindness of the Samaritan was
particularly admirable because Jews and Samaritans generally were
enemies. Under the law, a good samaritan is someone who voluntarily
renders aid to another in distress when under no duty to do
so.</p><p>Since a system administrator doesn't have a legal duty to be
a good samaritan, she owes no legal duty to the software vendor who
supplied the software to do anything to stop the illegal
copying.</p><p>Many companies have internal codes of conduct that obligate
employees to report illegal conduct to their managers or company
executives. If a system administrator fails to report illegal
copying of software, she may be in violation of company policy and
subject herself to possible termination. I always advise an
employee to conduct herself according to the company's own
published rules.</p><p>If a company doesn't have a published code of conduct, the
system administrator should try to understand her company's implied
code. Is open cheating tolerated within the company? Do senior
managers condone or encourage illegal conduct? I once sued a
company on behalf of an employee who was fired for refusing to dump
toxic waste into the public sewer system leading to the San
Francisco Bay. Unfortunately, as I came to discover, such behavior
was sanctioned and encouraged by the most senior executives of the
company. In such a company, reporting illegal behavior would be
useless.</p><p>Would it be useless to report that your company makes
unauthorized copies of software? If you were a system administrator
for such a company, would you want to continue working for them?
Would you want to stay at a company that openly encouraged
copyright infringement?</p><p>What about a system administrator who herself was making
illegal copies of software? She cannot excuse her own illegal act
by claiming that her employer told her to do so, because an
employee cannot knowingly violate a law and blame her employer for
it.</p><p>As a practical matter, of course, if there were a lawsuit or
a criminal complaint about illegal copying, it probably would be
the most senior company official responsible who would be punished,
not the low-level employee who was merely following orders. But I
would still advise the system administrator not to risk liability
by committing an illegal act. It is safer simply to refuse to do so
or to quit.</p><p>An employee who is asked to perform an illegal act and
refuses to do so is protected from retaliation in many states. An
employee who reports illegal acts to more senior management or to
an appropriate government agency is often protected by
&ldquo;whistle-blower&rdquo; laws. A company can be ordered to pay
substantial damages, including back pay, for retaliating against
whistle-blowers.</p><p>But what about the ethical dimension to the question posed by
my editor? Why do we care if a company makes unauthorized copies of
a proprietary vendor's computer software? We don't have a good
samaritan duty to help them, so why should we bother ourselves with
their problem? After all, one major objective for the Free and Open
Source movement is to make software available that can be freely
copied, modified and distributed. By definition (e.g., the Open
Source Definition,
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php" target="_self">www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php</a>)
it is never illegal for a company to make as many copies as it
wants of free and open-source software.</p><p>If proprietary software companies don't share our ideals,
that's their problem and not ours? Right? I'm not so sure that is
ethical.</p><p>One reason the open-source software model works is that we
can rely on the copyright law to enforce our licenses. When a
company takes GPL-licensed code and converts it into proprietary
software, for example, we can assert the copyright law and sue them
for copyright infringement to prevent them from misusing the
software. How, then, can we ignore that same law and make illegal
copies of proprietary software? Is it ethical to rely on a law to
protect our own interests and to violate that same law when it
comes to someone else's?</p><p>This is one reason why I encourage everyone NOT to make
illegal copies of proprietary software. I am willing to let the
copyright laws work for me, even as large proprietary software
companies use that same law to compete against me.</p><p>As an ethical attorney&mdash;or at least an attorney who strives
to be ethical&mdash;I must advise everyone to obey the law. Don't make
unauthorized copies of software, and don't just sit idly by when
you see others in your company doing so.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
attorney-client relationship specifically with reference to all the
facts of a particular situation and the law of your jurisdiction.
Even though an attorney wrote this article, the information in this
article must not be relied upon as a substitute for obtaining
specific legal advice from a licensed attorney.</p></div></div>
