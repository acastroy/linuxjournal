    A few simple design guidelines are presented to make your
    games more enjoyable to the players.
    </p></div></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Sweets are first tasted by the eye, but flavour
is the heart and soul of all confectionery. --John Millar
(1826-1896)</p></blockquote></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x257d580.0x26753f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>It's called a joystick because games are
fun&mdash;or at least they're meant to be. Of course, I doubt this is
the real reason. Nevertheless, I stand by my reasoning as the
definitive one. It may not be true, but it makes sense.</p><p>Although there are several books available on the market
about game programming, there are very few about game design. The
few that are available tend to be either very brief and shallow, or
they're not really geared towards video game design, instead
covering the intricacies of board or paper games.</p><p>To me, it seems obvious that there is little point in writing
a game that no one wishes to play. There are certain guidelines
that can be followed in order to make your game more
appealing.</p><p>Graphic and sound content obviously play a big part in making
your game enjoyable, but these areas are covered amply elsewhere.
This article covers the lesser known basics of playability: the
control system and level design. Along the way, I'll make the
occasional reference to a D*S game I wrote about a year ago called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Teardrop Explodes</em></span>. If you wish to try it out,
feel free to download it from
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/2276/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x257d580.0x2675660"></a>The Control System</h2></div></div><p>In any game the control system should be kept simple. Why use
four different buttons when one will do? An example of this
syndrome appears in most of the new 3D soccer games. Here, 3 or 4
buttons are used just to kick the ball in a variety of manners
(pass, shoot, etc.). Older soccer games used only one button. Why?
Well, that's all that they had, and the action performed was
dependent on how long you held the button down. Perhaps this is why
the so-called &ldquo;next-generation&rdquo; fail to match the playability of
the older titles.</p><p>Similarly, if the control system isn't intuitive, players
will not enjoy playing your game. One simple reason that may happen
is that they may not be able to use the keys you chose for the
game; therefore, your game should allow the user to redefine the
controls. Incidentally, I failed to follow this practice in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Teardrop Explodes</em></span>. I later discovered that it
was not playable with keyboards on which the cursor keys are laid
out differently than my own&mdash;a lesson learned the hard way.</p><p>Another reason for this is that the controls go against the
player's expectations. For example, I recently played a game where
I used a joystick to control a spaceship. I naturally expected the
craft to bank when I pulled the stick left or
right&mdash;wrong&mdash;instead, this action caused the craft to rotate.
Needless to say, I didn't enjoy playing that game.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x257d580.0x2675870"></a>Level Design</h2></div></div><p>Arguably, this is the single most important section of any
game production. The player has to be drawn into the game, and
immersed in the atmosphere. There are various techniques to gain
his interest, such as lighting and ambient sounds. However, it is
also the most difficult area to find any guidelines, since all
games differ in their level structure.</p><p>Ambient sounds can be used for such trivial things as a pipe
dripping or the growls of monsters. These sounds should be used
with care; otherwise you could end up swamping the player and
ruining his game experience. If at all possible, they should be
used only when other sounds are not being played. One way to do
this is to use &ldquo;trigger points&rdquo; in the level, which are similar
to invisible tiles that play the required sound when the cursor
passes over them.</p><p>The player should be surprised once in a while. For example,
how many times did you jump the last time you played
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Doom</em></span>? There you are, cautiously stalking along
a corridor, when suddenly a crowd of demons charge through a hidden
door behind you&mdash;this is exactly the kind of effect you should aim
to achieve.</p><p>You should also allow the player to interact with the
environment. If the player sees or tries something he can't get or
do, he becomes frustrated. In arcade games, this generally involves
wanton destruction of the surroundings. In the case of your game,
let it happen in some fashion. Even if the scenery doesn't actually
change, use big explosions&mdash;big explosions always satisfy a
player's thirst for destruction.</p><p>Finally, and this is the big one, play test. Play testing
your level designs and game in general is very important. Things to
look out for include the general &ldquo;flow&rdquo; of the game, difficulty
levels and the balance of the control system. I talked about
control systems earlier, so let's consider the other two
points.</p><p>In order for a game to &ldquo;flow&rdquo;, all the disparate elements
of your game should come together and mesh seamlessly. This is a
harder objective to achieve than it sounds, so it helps to decide
on a common theme for the game. You may want to come up with an
intricate story line or a particular graphical style. Whatever you
choose, just make sure that it remains consistent&mdash;that nothing
seems out of place.</p><p>The difficulty setting of a game is, again, quite hard to
balance exactly right. Obviously, the game should start easily and
get progressively harder. What's the best way to go about this?
Well, the most effective method I have come across is to have a
fairly simple starting section fpr the game, which allows the user
to experiment with the control system and use different abilities
of their on-screen persona. After this, you can throw some harder
game elements at them. However, don't be relentless in this action;
slightly. The easiest way to do this is to have a &ldquo;pause game&rdquo;
option. You could also have bonus levels or hidden games. The best
way to judge where to use one of these lulls is, of course, to play
test.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x257d580.0x2675be0"></a>Bits and Pieces</h2></div></div><p>There are other things to consider regarding playability. For
example, in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Teardrop Explodes</em></span>, I tried to
create the hi-score table so that players would find it fairly easy
to get their name in lights. On the other hand, I made it quite
hard, but certainly possible, to beat the highest score. You should
also save the table, as this gives players something to beat after
they have completed the game.</p><p>Saving the game's configuration data is also advisable. The
player should have to monitor brightness levels only once, for
example.</p><p>A recurring trend in games is to use cut-scenes to further
the story line. If you use them, try to keep them fairly short and
allow them to be skipped through as well. The same goes for the
&ldquo;Game Over&rdquo; sequence, where the player will (hopefully) be eager
to have another try at your game. Also, if you have a &ldquo;lives&rdquo;
system, don't take too long in restarting the game. If you do, the
player might get frustrated and just switch off.</p><p>As for game completion, you should offer something that
rewards the player directly for how much effort he has put into the
play. Someone who spends three months of his life trying to finish
your game will want something fairly substantial. If it takes 30
minutes, on the other hand, a single static screen would
suffice.</p><p>Again, I'm not claiming that following these tips will make
your game a block buster. Guidelines such as these are purely
optional; if you disagree with anything, feel free to do it your
way. Incidentally, the quote at the start of this article is by a
Scottish sweet-maker and appears on the back of his company's
wrappers. I include it because I think the quote can be applied
equally to games, particularly in these days of eye candy over
content. I wish you luck with your projects, and I look forward to
seeing a flurry of games activity on the Linux scene.</p></div></div>
