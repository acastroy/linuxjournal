    Here's a Kernel Korner geared for the new user. Mr. Bandel
    guides us through the steps of configuring and compiling the
    kernel.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f33a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux is many users' introduction to a
truly powerful, configurable operating system. In the past, a
Unix-like operating system was out of reach for most. If it wasn't
the operating system's 4-digit price tag, it was the hardware. Even
the now free-for-personal-use SCO Unixware requires a system with
SCSI drives, and most of us are using IDE to keep costs down. Along
with the power that Linux brings comes the need to perform a task
users have not had to do on simpler operating systems: configure
the kernel to your hardware and operations.
</p><p>Previous installation kernels from 1.2.x and before
<span   class="emphasis"><em>suggested</em></span> that you rebuild; however, with the
new 2.0.x kernel, rebuilding has almost become a necessity. The
kernel that comes with the installation packages from Red Hat,
Caldera, Debian and most others, is a generic, &ldquo;almost everything
is included&rdquo; kernel. While rebuilding a kernel may seem like a
daunting task and living with the installed kernel may not be too
bad, rebuilding is a good introduction to your system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f3558"></a>Why Roll Your Own?</h2></div></div><p>The standard installation kernels are an attempt to make as
many systems as possible usable for the task of installing a
workable Linux system. As such, the kernel is bloated and has a lot
of unnecessary code in it for the average machine. It also does not
have some code a lot of users want.</p><p>Then, of course, there's always the need to upgrade the
kernel because you've bought new hardware, etc. Upgrading within a
series is usually very straightforward. When it comes to upgrading,
say from 1.2.something to 2.0.something, now the task is beyond the
scope of this article and requires some savvy. Better to get a new
distribution CD and start fresh&mdash;this is also true for upgrading to
the experimental 2.1.x kernels.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f36b8"></a>Kernel Version Numbering</h2></div></div><p>All Linux kernel version numbers contain three numbers
separated by periods (dots). The first number is the kernel
version. We are now on the third kernel version, 2. Some of you may
be running a version 1 kernel, and I am aware of at least one
running version 0 kernel.</p><p>The second number is the kernel major number. Major numbers
which are even numbers (0 is considered an even number) are said to
be stable. That is, these kernels should not have any crippling
bugs, as they have been fairly heavily tested. While some contain
small bugs, they can usually be upgraded for hardware compatibility
or to armor the kernel against system crackers. For example, kernel
2.0.30, shunned by some in favor of 2.0.29 because of reported
bugs, contains several patches including one to protect against SYN
denial of service attacks. The kernels with odd major numbers are
developmental kernels. These have not been tested and often as not
will break any software packages you may be running. Occasionally,
one works well enough that it will be adopted by users needing the
latest and greatest support before the next stable release. This is
the exception rather than the rule, and it requires substantial
changes to a system.</p><p>The last number is the minor number and is increased by one
for each release. If you see kernel version 2.0.8, you know it's a
kernel 2.0, stable kernel, and it is the ninth release (we begin
counting with 0).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f3870"></a>Assumptions</h2></div></div><p>I hate to make any assumptions; they always seem to come back
to bite me. So I need to mention a few things so that we're working
off the same sheet of music. In order to compile a kernel, you'll
need a few things. First, I'll assume you've installed a
distribution with a 2.0.x kernel, all the base packages and perhaps
a few more. You'll also need to have installed
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> version 2.7 and all the
supporting gcc libraries. You'll also need the libc-dev library and
the binutils and bin86 packages (normally installed as part of a
standard distribution install). If you download the source or copy
it from a CD, you'll also need the
<span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>gunzip</b></span> packages. Also, you'll need
lots of disk real estate. Plan on 7MB to download, another 20MB to
unpack this monster and a few more to compile it.</p><p>Needless to say, many of the things we will discuss require
you to be logged in as root. If you've downloaded the kernel as a
non-privileged user and you have write permission to the /usr/src
subdirectory, you can still do much of this task without becoming
root. For the newcomers to Linux, I highly recommend you do as much
as possible as a non-privileged user and become root (type:
<b  >su&nbsp;-&nbsp;face</b>) only for those jobs that
require it. One day, you'll be glad you acquired this habit.
Remember, there are two kinds of systems administrators, those who
have totally wrecked a running setup inadvertently while logged in
as root, and those who will.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f3b30"></a>Obtaining/Upgrading the Source</h2></div></div><p>Kernel sources for Linux are available from a large number of
ftp sites and on almost every Linux distribution CD-ROM. For
starters, you can go to ftp.funet.fi, the primary site for the
Linux kernel. This site has a list of mirror sites from which you
can download the kernel. Choosing the site nearest you helps
decrease overall Internet traffic.</p><p>Once you've obtained the source, put it in the /usr/src
directory. Create a subdirectory to hold the source files once they
are unpacked using tar. I recommend naming the directories
something like linux-2.0.30 or kernel-2.0.30, substituting your
version numbers. Create a link to this subdirectory called linux
using the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -sf linux-2.0.30 linux
</pre><p>I included the <b  >-f</b> in the link command
because if you already have a kernel source in /usr/src, it will
contain this link too, and we want to force it to look in our
subdirectory.1 The only time you may have a problem is if linux is
a subdirectory name, not a link. If you have this problem, you'll
have to rename the subdirectory before continuing:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mv linux linux-2.0.8
</pre>


Now issue the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xzvf linux-kernel-source.tar.gz
</pre>


I have a habit of always including <b  >w</b> (wait for
confirmation) in the tar option string, then when I see that the
.tar.gz or .tgz file is going to unpack into its own subdirectory,
I <b  >ctrl-C</b> out and reissue the command without the
<b  >w</b>. This way I can prevent corrupted archives
from unpacking into the current directory.
</p><p>On some versions of <span   class="bold"><b>ln</b></span>
(notably version 3.13), the force option (<b  >-f</b>)
does not work. You'll have to first remove the link then establish
it again. This works correctly by version 3.16.</p><p>Once you have the kernel unpacked, if you have any patches
you wish to apply, now is a good time. Let's say you don't wish to
run kernel 2.0.30, but you do want the tcp-syn-cookies. Copy the
patch (called tcp-syn-cookies-patch-1) into the /usr/src directory
and issue the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
patch &lt; tcp-syn-cookies-patch-1
</pre><p>This command applies the patch to the kernel. Look for files
with an .rej extension in in the /usr/src directory. These files
didn't patch properly. They may be unimportant, but peruse them
anyway. If you installed a Red Hat system with some but not all of
the kernel source (SPARC, PowerPC, etc.), you'll see some of these
files. As long as they're not for your architecture, you're okay.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f4160"></a>Preparation</h2></div></div><p>As a final note, before we change
(<span   class="bold"><b>cd</b></span>) into the kernel source
directory and start building our new kernel, let's check some links
that are needed. In your /usr/include directory, make sure you have
the following soft links:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
asm - /usr/src/linux/include/asm
linux - /usr/src/linux/include/linux
scsi - /usr/src/linux/include/scsi
</pre><p>Now, you see another reason to standardize the location of
the kernel. If you don't put the latest kernel you wish to install
in /usr/src/linux (via a link), the above links will not reach
their intended target (dangling links), and the kernel may fail to
compile.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f4370"></a>How to proceed</h2></div></div><p>Once everything else is set up, change directories into
/usr/src/linux. Although you may want to stop off and peruse some
of the documentation in the Documentation directory, particularly
if you have any special hardware needs. Also, several of the CD-ROM
drivers need to be built with customized settings. While they
usually work as is, these drivers may give warning messages when
loaded. If this doesn't bother you and they work as they should,
don't worry. Otherwise, read the appropriate .txt, .h (header)
files and .c (c code) files. For the most part, I have found them
to be well commented and easy to configure. If you don't feel
brave, you don't have to do it. Just remember you can always
restore the original file by unpacking the gzipped tar file (or
reinstalling the .rpm files) again.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f4478"></a>Beginning to Compile</h2></div></div><p>The first command I recommend you issue is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make mrproper
</pre><p>While this command is not necessary when the kernel source is
in pristine condition, it is a good habit to cultivate. This
command ensures that old object files are not littering the source
tree and are not used or in the way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12f4630"></a>Configuring the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Now, you're ready to configure the kernel. Before starting,
you'll need to understand a little about modules. Think of a module
as something you can plug into the kernel for a special purpose. If
you have a small network at home and sometimes want to use it (but
not always), maybe you'll want to compile your Ethernet card as a
module. To use the module, the machine must be running and have
access to the /lib/modules This means that the drive (IDE, SCSI,
etc., but could be an ethernet card in the case of nfs), the file
system (normally ext2 but could be nfs) and the kernel type
(hopefully elf) must be compiled in and cannot be modules. Modules
aren't available until the kernel is loaded, the drive (or network)
accessed, and the file system mounted. These files must be compiled
into the kernel or it will not be able to mount the root partition.
If you're mounting the root partition over the network, you'll need
the network file system module, and your Ethernet card
compiled.</p><p>Why use modules? Modules make the kernel smaller. This
reduces the amount of protected space never given up by the kernel.
Modules load and unload and that memory can be reallocated. If you
use a module more than about 90% of the time the machine is up,
compile it. Using a module in this case can be wasteful of memory,
because while the module takes up the same amount of memory as if
it were compiled, the kernel needs a little more code to have a
hook for the module. Remember, the kernel runs in protected space,
but the modules don't. That said, I don't often follow my own
advice. I compile in: ext2, IDE and elf support only. While I use
an Ethernet card almost all the time, I compile everything else as
modules: a.out, java, floppy, iso9660, msdos, minix, vfat, smb,
nfs, smc-ultra (Ethernet card), serial, printer, sound, ppp, etc.
Many of these only run for a few minutes at a time here and
there.</p><p>The next step is to configure the kernel. Here we have three
choices&mdash;while all do the same thing, I recommend using one of the
graphical methods. The old way was to simply type:
<b  >make&nbsp;config</b>. This begins a long series of
questions. However, if you make a mistake, your only option is to
press <b  >ctrl-C</b> and begin again. You also can't go
back in the sequence, and some questions depend on previous
answers. If for some reason you absolutely can't use either of the
graphical methods, be my guest.</p><p>I recommend using either
<b  >make&nbsp;menuconfig</b> or
<b  >make&nbsp;xconfig</b>. In order to use
<span   class="bold"><b>menuconfig</b></span>, you must have
installed the ncurses-dev and the tk4-dev libraries. If you didn't
install them and you don't want to use the next method, I highly
recommend that you install them now. You can always uninstall them
later.</p><p>To run <b  >make&nbsp;xconfig</b>, you must install
and configure X. Since X is such a memory hog, I install, configure
and <span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> only for this portion
of the process, going back to a console while the kernel compiles
so it can have all the memory it needs. The xconfig menu is, in my
opinion, the best and easiest way to configure the kernel. Under
menuconfig, if you disable an option, any subordinate options are
not shown. Under xconfig, if you disable an option, subordinate
options still show, they are just greyed out. I like this because I
can see what's been added since the last kernel. I may want to
enable an option to get one of the new sub-options in order to to
experiment with it.</p><p>I'm going to take some space here to describe the sections in
the kernel configuration and tell you some of the things I've
discovered&mdash;mostly the hard way.</p><p>The first section is the code-maturity-level option. The only
question is whether you want to use developmental drivers and code.
You may not have a choice if you have some bleeding edge hardware.
If you choose &ldquo;no&rdquo;, the experimental code is greyed out or not
shown. If you use this kernel for commercial production purposes,
you'll probably want to choose &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p><p>The second section concerns modules. If you want modules,
choose &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for questions 1 and 3. If you want to use
proprietary modules that come with certain distributions, such as
Caldera's OpenLinux for their Netware support, also answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo;
to the second question since you won't be able to recompile the
module.</p><p>The third section is general setup. Do compile the kernel as
ELF and compile support for ELF binaries. Not compiling the proper
support is a definite &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo;. You'll get more efficient code
compiling the kernel for the machine's specific architecture
(Pentium or 486), but a 386 kernel will run in any 32-bit Intel
compatible clone; a Pentium kernel won't. An emergency boot disk
for a large number of computers (as well as distribution install
disks) is best compiled as a 386. However, a 386 will not run a
kernel compiled for a Pentium.</p><p>Next comes block devices&mdash;nothing special here. If your root
device is on an IDE drive, just make sure you compile it.</p><p>Then comes networking. For computers not connected to a
network, you won't need much here unless you plan to use one
computer to dial-out while others connect through it. In this case,
you'll need to read up on such things as masquerading and follow
the suggested guidelines.</p><p>SCSI support is next, though why it doesn't directly follow
block devices I don't know. If your root partition is on a SCSI
device, don't choose modules for SCSI support.</p><p>SCSI low-level drivers follow general SCSI support. Again,
modules only for devices that don't contain the root
partition.</p><p>The next section takes us back to networking again. Expect to
do a lot of looking for your particular card here as well as some
other support such as <span   class="bold"><b>ppp</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>slip</b></span>, etc. If you use
<span   class="bold"><b>nfs</b></span> to mount your root device,
compile in Ethernet support.</p><p>For those lucky enough to be needing ISDN support, the ISDN
subsection will need to be completed.</p><p>Older CD-ROMs may require support from the next section. If
you're using a SCSI or IDE CD-ROM, you can skip this one.</p><p>Next comes file systems. Again, compile what you need, in
most cases ext2 and use modules for the rest.</p><p>Character devices are chosen next. Non-serial mice, like the
PS/2 mouse are supported. Look on the bottom of your mouse. Many
two-button mice are PS/2 type, even though they look and connect
like serial mice. You'll almost certainly want serial support
(generic) as a minimum. Generic printer support is also listed
here.</p><p>The penultimate section is often the most troubling: sound.
Choose carefully from the list and read the available help. Make
sure you've chosen the correct I/O base and IRQs for your card. The
MPU I/O base for a SoundBlaster card is listed as 0. This is
normally 330 and your sound module will complain if this value is
incorrect. Don't worry. One of the nice things about modules is you
can recompile and reinstall the modules as long as the kernel was
compiled with the hook. (Aren't modules great?).</p><p>The final section contains one question that should probably
be answered as &ldquo;no, kernel hacking&rdquo;.</p><p>Save your configuration and exit.</p><p>I have, on several occasions, had trouble editing the numbers
in menuconfig or xconfig to values I knew were correct. For
whatever reason, I couldn't change the number or
<span   class="bold"><b>config</b></span> wouldn't accept the number,
telling me it was invalid. For example, changing the SoundBlaster
IRQ from the config default of 7 to 5, and the MPU base I/O from 0
to 300. If you experience this problem, but everything else went
well, don't despair. The file you just wrote when you did a
&ldquo;Save&rdquo; and &ldquo;Exit&rdquo; is an editable text file. You may use your
text editor of choice: Emacs, vi, CrispLite, joe, etc. Your
configuration file is in the /usr/src/linux directory and is called
<b  >.config</b>. The leading dot causes the file to be
hidden during a normal directory listing
(<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>), but it shows up when the
<b  >-a</b> option is specified. Just edit the numbers in
this file that you had trouble with in the configuration process.
Next, type <b  >make&nbsp;dep</b> to propagate your
configurations from the .config file to the proper subdirectories
and to complete the setup. Finally, type
<b  >make&nbsp;clean</b> to prepare for the final kernel
build.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12ebc80"></a>Building the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>We're now ready to begin building the kernel. There are
several options for accomplishing this task:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >make zImage</b>: makes the basic,
compressed kernel and leaves it in the
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot directory as zImage.</p></li><li><p><b  >make zlilo</b>: Copies the zImage to
the root directory (unless you edited the top-level Makefile) and
runs LILO. If you choose to use this option, you'll have to ensure
that /etc/lilo.conf is preconfigured.</p></li><li><p><b  >make zdisk</b>: Writes zImage to a
floppy disk in /dev/fd0 (the first floppy drive&mdash;the a: drive in
DOS). You'll need the disk in the drive before you start. You can
accomplish the same thing by running
<b  >make&nbsp;zImage</b> and copying the image to a
floppy disk
<b  >cp&nbsp;/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage&nbsp;/dev/fd0</b>
Note that you'll need to use a high-density disk. The low density
720k disks will reportedly not boot the kernel.</p></li><li><p><b  >make boot</b>: Works just the same
as the zImage option.</p></li><li><p><b  >make bzImage</b>: Used for big
kernels and operates the same as zImage. You will know if you need
this option, because <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> will
fail with a message that the image is too big.</p></li><li><p><b  >make bzdisk</b>: Used for big
kernels and operates the same as zdisk. You will know if you need
this option, because make will fail with a message that the image
is too big.</p></li></ul></div><p>Other <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> options are
available, but are specialized, and are not covered here. Also, if
you need specialized support, such as for a RAM disk or SMP, read
the appropriate documentation and edit the Makefile in
/usr/src/linux (also called the top-level Makefile) accordingly.
Since all the options I discussed above are basically the same as
the zImage option, the rest of this article deals with
<b  >make&nbsp;zImage</b>--it is the easiest way to build
the kernel.
</p><p>For those of you who wish to speed up the process and won't
be doing other things (such as configuring other applications), I
suggest you look at the man page for make and try out the
<b  >-j</b> option (perhaps with a limit like 5) and also
the <b  >-l</b> option.</p><p>If you chose modules during the configuration process, you'll
want to issue the commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make modules
make modules_install
</pre><p>to put the modules in their default location of
/lib/modules/2.0.x/, x being the kernel minor number. If you
already have this subdirectory and it has subdirectories such as
block, net, scsi, cdrom, etc., you may want to remove 2.0.x and
everything below it unless you have some proprietary modules
installed, in which case don't remove it. When the modules are
installed, the subdirectories are created and populated.
</p><p>You could just as easily have combined the last three
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make zImage; make modules; make modules_install
</pre><p>then returned after all the disk churning finished. The ;
(semicolon) character separates sequential commands on one line and
performs each command in order so that you don't have to wait
around just to issue the next command.
</p><p>Once your kernel is built and your modules installed, we have
a few more items to take care of. First, copy your kernel to the
root (or /boot/ or /etc/, if you wish):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage /zImage
</pre><p>You should also copy the /usr/src/linux/System.map file to
the same directory as the kernel image. Then change (cd) to the
/etc directory to configure LILO. This is a very important step. If
we don't install a pointer to the new kernel, it won't boot.
Normally, an install kernel is called vmlinuz. Old-time Unix users
will recognize the construction of this name. The trailing &ldquo;z&rdquo;
means the image is compressed. The &ldquo;v&rdquo; and &ldquo;m&rdquo; also have
significance and mean &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; and &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; respectively and
pertain to memory and disk management. I suggest you leave the
vmlinuz kernel in place, since you know it works.
</p><p>Edit the /etc/lilo.conf file to add your new kernel. Use the
lines from the <b  >image=/vmlinuz</b> line to the next
<b  >image=</b> line or the end. Duplicate what you see,
then change the first line to <b  >image=/zImage</b>
(assuming your kernel is in the root directory) and choose a
different name for the <b  >label=</b>. The first image
in the file is the default, others will have to be specified on the
command line in order to boot them. Save the file and type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lilo
</pre><p>You will now see the kernel labels, and the first one will
have an asterisk. If you don't see the label that you gave your new
kernel or LILO terminates with an error, you'll need to redo your
work in /etc/lilo.conf (see LILO man pages).
</p><p>We're almost ready to reboot. At this point, if you know your
system will only require one reboot to run properly, you might want
to issue the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
depmod -a 2.0.x
</pre><p>where x is the minor number of the kernel you just built.
This command creates the dependencies file some modules need.
You'll also want to make sure you don't boot directly into
<span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span>. For Red Hat type systems,
this means ensuring the /etc/inittab file doesn't have a default
run level of 5, or that you remember to pass LILO the run level at
boot time. For Debian systems, you can just type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mv /etc/init.d/xdm /etc/init.d/xdm.orig

shutdown -r now
</pre><p>While typing <b  >reboot</b> or pressing the
<b  >ctrl+alt+del</b> key combination usually works, I
don't recommend either one. Under some circumstances, the file
systems won't be properly unmounted and could corrupt open files.
At the LILO prompt, if you need to boot the old kernel or pass some
parameters for bootup and you don't see the
<b  >boot:</b> prompt, you can try pressing either the
<b  >shift</b> or <b  >ctrl</b> key, and the
<b  >boot:</b> prompt should appear. Once you have it,
press <b  >tab</b> to see the available kernel labels.
Type the label and optionally enter any parameters for bootup.
Normally, however, the default kernel should boot automatically
after the timeout interval specified in the /etc/lilo.conf file.
During bootup, you may see a few error messages containing:
SIOCADDR or the like. These usually indicate that a module
(normally a network module) didn't load. We'll handle this shortly.
If you got the error, &ldquo;VFS, cannot mount root&rdquo;, you didn't
compile the proper disk or file-system support into the kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12ed280"></a>Troubleshooting</h2></div></div><p>Due to the different ways in which each distribution handles
daemon startup from /etc/inittab, it is difficult in this article
to cover all the possible reasons your bootup may not have gone
smoothly and the reasons why. However, I can tell you where to
start looking.</p><p>First, run <b  >depmod&nbsp;-a</b> to ensure you
have an up-to-date, module dependency file (it will be created in
the appropriate subdirectory). If you get a string of errors about
unresolved dependencies, old modules are present in the modules
subdirectories, and you didn't configure the kernel with &ldquo;Module
Versions&rdquo; enabled. This is not a fatal error. The modules you
compiled and installed are good. Check the /etc/conf.modules file
and make sure that any lines pointing to /lib/modules are
complete:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/xx
</pre><p>(Note: the grave quote on each side of
<b  >uname&nbsp;-r</b> is located above the Tab key in
the upper left corner of the keyboard on a U.S. keyboard).
</p><p>Make sure <span   class="bold"><b>kerneld</b></span> is running
and that it is loaded early in the bootup process. If it is, then
the system doesn't need to explicitly load modules, kerneld will
handle it. Be careful about calling kerneld too early in the first
rc script. kerneld will stop the bootup process forcing a hard
reboot via the reset button or power switch, if it is called before
the system knows its host name. If this happens to you, you can
reboot passing LILO the <b  >-b</b> argument which
prevents <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> from executing any
rc scripts. Next, look in /etc/rc.d/ at the rc, rc.sysinit and
rc.modules files. One or more may point to a directory such as
/etc/modules/`uname -r`/`uname -v` where a list of bootup modules
are located. You can just copy the old file over to the new
directory;</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /etc/modules/`uname -r` ;
cp /etc/modules/2.0.xx/g#1 Thu 3 Sep 1997.\
        default /etc/modules/`uname -r`/\
        `uname -v`.default""
</pre><p>Your system will almost certainly have a different date for
the modules file. Your system also may or may not use the default
extension. Pay close attention to the use of grave quotes and
double quotes in the above example, since both are needed in the
proper places. Once you have found the keys to your system, you
should be able to reboot into a properly functioning system. If you
experience further problems, the best place to get quick, expert
advice is on a mailing list dedicated to your particular
distribution. Those successfully running a particular distribution
usually delight in assisting novices with problems they may
encounter. Why? Because they hit the same brick walls when they
were novices and received help with many problems. Lurk a few days
on a list, and if your question isn't asked by someone else, ask it
yourself. Check the mail-list archives first, if any are present.
These archives contain answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11fb580.0x12ed750"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>While building a kernel tailored to your system may seem a
daunting challenge for new administrators, the time spent is worth
it. Your system will run more efficiently, and more importantly,
you will have the satisfaction of building it yourself.</p><p>The few areas where you may encounter trouble are in
remembering to rerun LILO after installing the new kernel, but you
didn't overwrite your old one (or did you?), so you can always
revert to one that worked from the <b  >lilo:</b> prompt.
Distribution specific problems during bootup may also be
encountered during the first reboot but are usually easily
resolved. Help is normally only an e-mail away for those
distributions that don't come with technical support.</p></div></div>
