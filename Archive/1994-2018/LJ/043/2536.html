    Even as Linux's popularity and visibility increase,
    Windows NT is becoming the server of choice for corporate America.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbb5580.0xcad138"></a></h2></div></div><p>Recently, Linux has been showing up
regularly in the mainstream news. For example, there is an article
titled &ldquo;The Greatest OS That (N)ever Was&rdquo; in the August issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wired</em></span> which is both technically and
historically accurate. This article will certainly help increase
the visibility of Linux.
</p><p>Even as Linux's popularity and visibility increase, Windows
NT is becoming the server of choice for corporate America. Perhaps
choice is not the right word, but NT is fast becoming the automatic
answer for companies that don't want to rock the boat.</p><p>It wasn't that many years ago that everyone was saying &ldquo;You
can't go wrong buying IBM.&rdquo; At that time IBM was the 360 mainframe
and its offspring. It was hard to imagine that any other company or
operating system could take the place of this <span   class="emphasis"><em>big
iron</em></span>. Unisys, CDC and others had pieces of the total
mainframe market, but IBM seemed to be unstoppable. In fact, people
commonly said &ldquo;IBM machine&rdquo; when refering to a computer.</p><p>There is a lot to learn from this experience. Was it good
marketing on the part of IBM that made them the standard?
Initially, I expect it was. After all, marketing consists of doing
research, finding a need, matching your product or service to that
need and advertising the benefits of your solution.</p><p>Once other companies started to offer solutions that were as
good or better, IBM took advantage of its huge market share to
impose itself on the consumer and squelch the competition. For
example, even though a standard character set, ASCII, existed, IBM
used EBCDIC, their own character set. To enter the market the
competition was forced to be compatible with IBM and thus had to
use EBCDIC.</p><p>As machines became more and more powerful, minis and then
micros began to take over the office. At this point the game
changed. The new IBM was not a hardware/software giant like IBM but
the software-only company, Microsoft. Microsoft offered a better
solution which, at the time, meant a more cost-effective solution.
As a result, they got the market share and that is where we are
today.</p><p>Microsoft has clearly overpowered their competition in the
IBM tradition and has vendors such as Intel going along for the
ride. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>standard</em></span> is to be Microsoft
compatible; Plug-n-Play means working with Microsoft operating
systems. Virtually all PC hardware vendors bundle a Microsoft
operating system with the hardware.</p><p>The Linux community is playing catch-up, developing software
like SAMBA so that Linux will interact with Microsoft systems,
dealing with Plug-n-Play hardware that only works with Microsoft
operating systems and so forth. So, we have software that addresses
compatability issues. Now, we need the hook&mdash;the thing that will
make Linux a better solution. That hook isn't going to come from
out-spending Microsoft, it has to come from innovation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbb5580.0xcad5b0"></a>What Should We Do?</h2></div></div><p>I am more of an observer than an expert, but I do have some
suggestions. Some of these ideas come from a Seattle-based Linux
mailing list, the GLUE list (check out http://www.ssc.com/glue/)
and from talking to people about what they want.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>We need a certification program&mdash;a way to say that
someone is a certified Linux technician. Red Hat has started this
effort (check out http://www.interweft.com.au/redhat/) with what
they call &ldquo;The Red Hat Commercial Support System&rdquo;. I talked to
Robert Hart about it, and he pointed out that since the effort is
needed, Red Hat decided to go ahead on their own to get it moving.
Hopefully, other vendors, or possibly Linux International, will
turn this idea into an industry-wide effort.</p></li><li><p>We need a service business package. It is equally
applicable to any business where the service provider travels to
the homes of his customers&mdash;anything from a window washer to a
roofing contractor. Software for these types of entrepreneurs needs
to run on a laptop, which includes a printer. The issues that must
be addressed are customer database, cost estimation, invoicing,
inventory and travel route planning. This is not a trivial
application, however, once all the pieces are integrated, it offers
some great potential markets. While each specific market
(Contractors, for example) is not huge, the possibilities are
enormous. Also, these various industries have newsletters,
discussion groups and, in some cases, magazines. Offer an
innovative solution to such an industry and word will spread
quickly.</p></li><li><p>There are packages for FAXing and voice mail from
Linux. Putting together a commercial-quality solution for a small
business would make a great stand-alone application. As the
majority of the interface between users and the system would be via
the telephone, there is little concern for users having to learn to
use a new computer. The FAX interface could be handled through an
office e-mail gateway (which Linux could handle) again isolating
the office worker from the actual Linux command line.</p></li><li><p>Another huge market is government. Governments tend
to have limited budgets and want a solution that just addresses
their particular problem. Also, governments tend to communicate
with each other&mdash;particularly at the city and county level. This is
advantageous as it means that a good solution would require little
marketing beyond a couple of success stories. Government solutions
could include meeting-room scheduling, general word processing,
accounting, Internet connectivity and web servers. The main
difference between this market and the general market is the ease
with which you could market a tailor-made solution. It also offers
a good chance for local consultants to get involved.</p></li></ol></div><p>All of these solutions need a truly easy install. By this I
mean a bootable CD which installs and asks for the information it
needs. While it might be difficult to make a universal Linux system
this easy, for a specific market, it should be easy.</p><p>Remember, we don't have the money to be bigger than
Microsoft. We need to go after markets that better fit our size. If
we solve the problems of a few of the smaller markets, people will
start coming to us for a solution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbb5580.0xcada80"></a>Let's Talk About the Ideas</h2></div></div><p>We have established some HyperNews discussion groups for the
