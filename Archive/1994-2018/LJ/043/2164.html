The Interview
</p></div></div>
 Robert Nation's name crops up often in the man pages and other
documentation of Linux software. He was involved in the early
development of several key pieces of Linux software such as
FVWM&mdash;software that is still being revised, updated and run by
thousands of Linux users. For this reason, I approached Mr. Nation
to find out what he thinks of the changes made to his software and
to Linux in recent years.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: Although I've seen
your name listed in various pieces of software documentation, I
realize that I know few personal details. Would you fill me in on
your background?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: I grew up in Ithaca,
NY, where my father is a professor at Cornell University. I
received my bachelor's and master's degrees in Electrical
Engineering from Cornell. Since then I've been worked at Raytheon,
in Massachusetts, and Sanders, in southern New Hampshire. I've been
living in Merrimack, NH for several years now, with my wife (also
from Cornell and upstate NY) and three children&mdash;ages 4, 5 and
7.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: What sort of work are
you currently pursuing?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: I work for Sanders,
a Lockheed-Martin Company. Sanders is a leading supplier of
electronic counter-measures equipment for the U.S. military.
Sanders also works in communications and battle-field situational
awareness areas. I've been working on systems to detect and
classify helicopters and tanks at long range from the sounds they
make and to identify scuba divers from their echo in a high
frequency sonar.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: How did you get
involved with programming free software?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: After I started work
at Sanders, I realized that Unix workstations were an excellent
tool for signal analysis&mdash;in field tests, we record data from some
prototype radar, sonar or acoustic system, then load the data onto
our workstations to figure out the best approach for performing
computer-aided detection and classification of the targets.</p><p>Around 1990, I saw Linux mentioned on the Net and thought
that maybe a low-cost PC could be used for the signal
analysis&mdash;with the advantage that PC Laptops are cheap. They can
also be easily taken on field tests for on-site data analysis to
tune systems parameters while we are actually in the process of
testing the system. I bought a PC and started learning about Linux
to track this trend&mdash;and also brush up on my computer and software
skills at the same time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: How did you become
motivated to create FVWM, now one of the most widely-used
window-managers in the Linux community?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: My original reason
for creating FVWM was to help me view spectrograms of recorded
data. A spectrogram is a plot that shows time on the horizontal
axis, and frequency on the vertical axis. The brightness of each
pixel in the plot indicates the amount of power that was received
at that frequency and time. I like to complicate matters by using
color to indicate the direction of arrival of the data too. Anyway,
I started looking at bigger and bigger spectrograms&mdash;until they
were eventually 2000 pixels by 400 pixels, and I didn't want to
loose resolution by squeezing the image onto one screen. TVTWM or
VTWM would have been good enough for the job, but I wanted to learn
something about X11 programming, so I started ripping apart TWM to
create FVWM.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: What do the acronyms
FVWM and RXVT stand for?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: FVWM stands for
Feeble Virtual Window Manager. The original releases (around
version 0.8 or so) had almost no user selectable features, so it
really was feeble. I think the only thing that you could change was
the color of the window borders.</p><p>RXVT is Rob's version of XVT. I believe XVT stands for X
Virtual Terminal.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: How do you think FVWM
compares with TWM as far as size, speed, and memory?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: Although a few early
versions of FVWM were smaller (less memory usage) than TWM, I'm
sure that this is no longer the case. Also, people tend to use FVWM
modules, which consume even more memory.</p><p>TWM was not too much of a memory pig in the end&mdash;except that
it initialized a table of possible mouse-button and shift/alt
combinations that was fairly large. That table was used to store
binds of menus to mouse buttons. I believe that TWM even
initialized the table, so it really had to be allocated and then
largely swapped out. After I discovered that problem, FVWM didn't
have much advantage over TWM.</p><p>As far a speed is concerned, TWM uses less decorations, so it
is somewhat faster. This doesn't seem to make much difference with
todays fast displays, though.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: What do you think of
the newer FVWM variants which have been proliferating
recently?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: I use FVWM-95 now. I
think that the task-bar is a good feature, and motif
appearance/compatibility is a bit outdated in this new Microsoft
era. I haven't spent a lot of time looking at Afterstep or the
other variants of FVWM, but I did notice an increasing trend to use
shaped color pixmaps for a lot of gadgets, and these really slow
down the X terminal that I use at work.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: What were the
progenitors of RXVT, and what compelled you to began developing
it?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: RXVT is based on
XVT, which is still available on the net. XVT worked fine, but was
a little slow at updating the screen. I poked around for a while,
mostly to learn more X11 stuff. I also added the option for in-line
graphics, which I thought would be really useful for scientific
plotting&mdash;you could issue a plot command, see the results and have
the plot scroll away like any other text. Although I've used that
feature quite a bit, it didn't turn out to be as useful as I had
hoped. I do occasionally use
<span   class="bold"><b>Xgraph</b></span> to look at a bunch of
scatter plots and end up with a million plots all over the screen.
The graphics capability in RXVT does eliminate that problem.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: Browsing through a
book of Linux manual pages, I saw your name in the credits of the
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> program. What was your
involvement?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: There was a version
of top that directly read kernel structures to get the process
information, but it needed to be recompiled every time the kernel
changed and had to be updated frequently. There was also a brand
new version of the /proc-based <span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span>
program. All I did was combine the two, taking a lot of the display
software from the old version of top, and the process information
software from ps, to make the /proc-based version of top that you
see now. It took about two evenings, and other people have
maintained it since I first distributed it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: Have you worked on
any other Linux software other than the programs mentioned
above?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: Nothing that I have
distributed. A few months ago I tinkered with a small graphics
server, similar to <span   class="bold"><b>mgr</b></span>, but with
the ability to update windows other than the top-most window and to
update several windows at once&mdash;not just the active window. I got
the windowing system and text windows working in monochrome, but
never finished the rest of the graphics capability.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: Do you have plans to
finish the graphics server?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: Probably not, since
I just bought a new home computer with a whopping 16MB of memory,
and X runs very nicely on that equipment. It was an interesting
learning experience, though. The software needed to figure out
where windows overlap and update them correctly and efficiently is
not trivial.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: What were your first
experiences with and impressions of Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: I started using
Linux in about 1990. I think it was version 0.9 or so. I was very
impressed&mdash;I installed an SLS distribution which I downloaded to
the Sun computers at work and installed from floppy. As I recalled,
it worked perfectly. I still use that same installation at home,
upgraded piecemeal to the latest kernel, compilers and libraries.
Throughout all those years, I only remember one kernel that had
significant problems and had very few problems installing
packages.</p><p>We've just started using Linux at work now. There is a
significant issue in system maintenance&mdash;since the Suns come with
complete but rare updates, and Linux comes with continuous,
piecemeal updates, we don't know if its cheaper to pay the extra
money for Sun hardware and save the cost in system administration,
or just buy PCs and take the system administration risk. We're
using it experimentally now and will be taking a prototype
submarine communications system out to sea next year, using a Linux
laptop as a console for a rack of VME equipment.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: Why was Linux chosen
for this communications system?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: We're using Linux to
run the graphical displays (X11). Sanders has been using X11 and
Sun workstations for displays for a long time now, so we have a
significant knowledge and experience base. Our choices for the
submarine system were:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Connect a CRT monitor directly to the Real-time
system&mdash;this is acceptable, but its hard to get bulky CRTs into a
submarine&mdash;they have to load through a 30 inch diameter torpedo
loading hatch, which is about 2 stories high.</p></li><li><p>Use a separate Sun workstation&mdash;same problem</p></li><li><p>Use a Sun laptop&mdash;very expensive and a little
slow.</p></li><li><p>Use Windows&mdash;we have very little programming
experience.</p></li><li><p>Use Linux&mdash;we made this choice because of low cost,
good level of in-house programming experience and software source
code that is generally compatible with Sun software.</p></li></ol></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>:
Any thoughts about Linux or other subjects you'd like to add?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robert</b></span>: I don't know how
much more you could ask for in Linux&mdash;the developers have done a
fantastic job of getting this operating system together. I'm glad
to see that some software vendors are supporting
<span   class="bold"><b>matlab</b></span> versions of their software
now, but I wish there was more available. I wonder if there is a
market for someone to license limited rights to software like Word
or PowerPoint, and then port, sell and support it for Linux.</p><p>I would like to know if anyone is working on a
next-generation user interface. I suppose that this could be voice
activated, or more interesting, some kind of 3-D, maybe virtual
reality thing. I keep thinking of the brief excerpt from Jurassic
Park where they showed an interesting 3-D file manager and
wondering if there are any ideas there.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Larry</b></span>: Thanks for your
time.</p></div></div>
