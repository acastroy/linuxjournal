    This first of a four-part series introduces us to the GIMP,
    a Linux power tool for the graphics artist. Mr. Hammel used
    the GIMP to design this month's cover.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2975580.0x2a6d500"></a></h2></div></div><p>It has been a long time coming, but the
wait is over: Linux has its first real end-user power tool. It's
not for administrators. It's not for network hacks. It's not
another developers tool. It's for artists. It's for media managers
and graphics nuts. It's for fun. It's for real. It's the GIMP.
</p><p>This article is the first of a four part series on the GIMP.
This first part is a general introduction to the application
including some definitions and system requirements. Future articles
will cover basic functionality, an exploration of the Image Window
including the use of layers and a detailed walk-through of the
Toolbox.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2975580.0x2a6d660"></a>What is the GIMP?</h2></div></div><p>The GIMP is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>GNU Image Manipulation
Program</em></span>, a tool for manipulating graphics images that
borrows its look and feel from the popular Macintosh and Windows
program from Adobe called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Photoshop</em></span>. It is
used for all varieties of image processing, photo retouching and
image composition. Built-in features, such as scripting, make it
very easy to create logos for web pages and magazine cover art, and
the Plug-In API provides a convenient mechanism for extending the
very rich standard feature set. Support for a large number of input
and output file formats is provided, including support for reading
Photoshop files which is under development at the time of this
writing.</p><p>It is nearly impossible to discuss certain features of the
GIMP without first introducing others, but one must begin
somewhere. I will attempt to limit confusion by mentioning features
before they are discussed. Also, it will be impossible to go into
complete detail of all aspects of the GIMP even in four articles.
Layers, in particular, will be difficult to discuss at length
without compromising discussion of other aspects of the
application. Perhaps, if there is enough interest, I can expand
this series into a full sized published text. In the meantime,
these articles will provide an introductory view of this wonderful
new tool.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2975580.0x2a6d870"></a>Getting the GIMP</h2></div></div><p>The first thing you want is the program itself. Binary
versions of the latest release packaged in an RPM format will most
likely be available from Red Hat, although at the time of this
writing none of the latest developers releases were available in
binary. The GIMP's web site will also have binaries available for
some platforms, including Linux. Of course, the GIMP is also
distributed with full source code as well. The source distribution
can be retrieved from
ftp://scam.xcf.berkeley.edu/pub/gimp/developers/. There are two
files needed to build and install from the source: gimp-1.0.tar.gz
and gimp-data-1.0.tar.gz. The former is the real source code and
the latter is the standard set of brushes, palette and so forth
that comes with the default source distribution. Note that the
actual version and release numbers might be different, so just look
for the latest releases on the FTP site. At the time of this
writing the actual release number was 0.99.10.</p><p>Building from source should be a straightforward
process:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Unpack the archives</p></li><li><p>Run <b  >./configure</b></p></li><li><p>Run <b  >./make</b></p></li><li><p>Run <b  >./make install</b></p></li></ol></div><p>This process is required for both the source code and the
data files archives. If you intend to install in the default
locations under /usr/local, you need to be the root user to do the
last step. If you wish to install in some other location, you can
instead type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ./configure --prefix=/
</pre><p>There are a number of options available via the configure
program. Check the INSTALL file first, and if you can't find what
you need there try running:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ./configure --help
</pre>


Also, as always, help is available from the GIMP Developer and GIMP
user mailing lists (see the section at the end of this article for
Resources on the Net).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2975580.0x2a6df50"></a>Starting and Stopping the GIMP</h2></div></div><p>Once the GIMP has been installed you're ready to start
experimenting. Starting the program is simple: type
<b  >gimp</b>. If your system does not support the
MIT-SHM extension (see below), you can type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gimp --no-xshm
</pre><p>When the GIMP starts, it first reads a configuration file
located in the .gimp directory located in the user's $HOME
directory. This directory is where user-configurable options,
user-specific plug-ins, palettes, brushes and so forth are kept. A
similar set of directories are kept in the system directories (by
default under /usr/local/share and /usr/local/lib).
</p><p>If the GIMP does not find the .gimp directory in the users
$HOME directory, it will create and populate it for them. Since
this process can potentially take longer than just a few moments, a
window is displayed explaining what the program is doing. The user
need not do anything during this time. When the initialization of
the .gimp directory has completed, the program opens the main
window, and the user can begin work. Future invocations of the
application will not include the creation of the .gimp directory
unless that directory is removed for some reason between GIMP
sessions.</p><p>The configuration file, gimprc, contains the specifications
for the directory in which the GIMP is to find all of its files. In
this way a user can, if desired, use a locally installed version of
the GIMP instead of the one installed in the system directories.
The gimprc file also defines the default settings for many of the
features for the application. Such items as the speed at which the
&ldquo;marching ants&rdquo; (the moving dashed line that denotes a selected
region of an image) move, the number of colors to use, the GIMP
colormap option and the Gamma correction setting are defined in the
gimprc file. This file is well commented so you shouldn't have too
much trouble understanding what the various configurable parameters
affect. You should probably take a look at this file at least once
before starting the GIMP, although it may not be absolutely
necessary for you to become familiar with it, especially if you are
using a high-end system with a high-end graphics adapter.</p><p>The GIMP uses its own temporary and swap files for saving
runtime data. Most temporary files get removed at the end of a GIMP
session, however some of these files may remain after exiting. It
is recommended that the temporary directory be a directory that is
specific to the individual user. This directory should not be one
that is cleaned up by the system automatically. The swap file is a
file that can get very large due to the use of the tile-based
memory scheme that the GIMP uses. Because of this it is recommended
that the swap file directory be /tmp or some other directory on a
file system with plenty of disk space. Defaults for both the
temporary files directory and the swap file directory exist in the
gimprc file. You should verify that these are appropriate for your
use before doing any heavy, image-processing work.</p><p>One of the settings in the gimprc file that you might
consider changing is the one that allows the GIMP to use its own
colormap. If you have a system with 1MB of video memory (not system
memory&mdash;there is a difference) and you wish to run in a
high-resolution mode such as 800x600 or 1024x768, you may only be
able to run with a maximum of 256 colors. In this case the GIMP
(and many other applications, such as Netscape) will quickly run
out of colors. In some cases, with smart applications, you'll get
what's known as &ldquo;color flashing&rdquo;--where the color of windows and
the background changes depending on which window currently holds
the focus for keyboard and mouse input. Although a bit annoying,
color flashing is the result of a little trick provided in X
Windows applications to help guarantee they have enough colors.
They do this by <span   class="emphasis"><em>installing their own colormap</em></span>.
The GIMP allows you to do this in the gimprc file. However, this
option is not turned on by default. If you have a low-end video
system and run using an 8-bit (256 color) display, you'll want to
uncomment this option in the gimprc file before starting the GIMP.
If the color flashing that occurs is bothersome, there is another
option for setting the color cube. Changing the values here,
however, is a little trickier and should probably only be done if
you understand what &ldquo;dithering colors&rdquo; means.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2975580.0x2a6e318"></a>Remote Displays</h2></div></div><p>As with nearly all X applications, the GIMP supports the
ability to run on one machine and display on another. Most X
applications accept, through the Xt toolkit, the
<b  >-display</b> command-line option to specify a remote
host to display on. The GIMP accepts a similar command except that
two dashes are required. Somewhere in the evolution of Linux there
was a migration from one to two dashes for command-line options.
I'm sure there is a valid reason for it&mdash;I just never figured out
what it was. In any case, the command-line option for displaying on
a remote system is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
--display &lt;remote host&gt;:&lt;display number&gt;.&lt;screen&gt;
</pre><p>For most users, the display number and screen will both be 0
(zero).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2975580.0x2a6e528"></a>System Requirements</h2></div></div><p>The GIMP has been ported to many of the well known Unix
platforms, including Solaris, SGI, FreeBSD and, of course, Linux.
The software is not hardware specific since it makes use of the
low-level X11 interface provided by Xlib (GIMP's toolkit, gtk+,
does not rely on either the Xt toolkit or Motif). This allows the X
server to handle the actual screen drawing and lets the GIMP
provide the computational work of the display. Consequently, the
GIMP works with all of the well known X servers for Linux
(MetroLink, Xi Graphics and XFree86). As with any high-end graphics
tool, you'll have better results with the high-end graphics
adapters. I use a Matrox Mystique at 1152x900 with 4MB of video
memory that allows up to 16 million colors. Be sure to check the
server documentation or vendor's marketing material to find out if
the video adapter you use is supported.</p><p>One extension to the X Window Protocols that many X servers
support is the MIT Shared Memory Extension. This extension provides
a method for an X application to make use of the shared memory
resources of the operating system without having to go through the
Xlib interprocess communication channel. For this reason, the
processing of large images by the low-level X routines can be done
much faster. The GIMP makes use of this feature to help provide
speed enhancements. Unfortunately, not all X servers provide
support for this extension. If it appears the GIMP is not behaving
well, you can try starting it with the <b  >--no-xshm</b>
command-line option to disable the use of the MIT Shared Memory
Extension. One common scenario which often needs this option is
when a user starts the GIMP on one machine but has it display
across the Net on another system.</p><p>Note that all three of the major X server vendors (MetroLink,
Xi Graphics and the XFree86 Project) currently provide servers for
Linux that support this extension. However, older versions of these
servers may not. Some of the popular (but older) X terminals from
NCD also do not support this extension. To find out if your server
has this support, type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xdpyinfo | grep MIT-SHM
</pre><p>If this command prints out &ldquo;MIT-SHM&rdquo;, your server supports
the extension. If it doesn't, you need to use the
<b  >--no-xshm</b> option. On the Xi Graphics
AcceleratedX 3.1 server running with a Matrox Mystique video card,
the shared memory extension appeared to function incorrectly and
the GIMP had to be run without the use of the X shared-memory
support. A small number of other cards had similar problems with
this server. If you have few problems other than the windows which
display images are being redrawn incorrectly (they appear to have
overlapping tiles, for example), you should consider running with
the X shared-memory option disabled. Note that Xi Graphics is
currently working to resolve this problem, and the problem does not
exist for all cards supported by their X server.
</p><p>The GIMP uses a tile-based memory management system so that
extremely large images can be worked on without exhausting physical
memory. Even so, work like this benefits tremendously from
additional system memory. I recommend you have at least 16MB of
system memory to do simple web page graphics. If you intend to get
into print media you'll be working on much larger images, with X/Y
dimensions of 2000x2000 or more. In these cases you need at least
64MB of memory and probably more.</p><p>CPU speed is also important for doing high-end graphics work.
You can use the GIMP on any Linux-based hardware platform, but you
may get frustrated waiting for some pixel operations to complete on
older systems. For example, operations like blurring, mosaics or
adding sparkles to regions of images can be very CPU intensive. I
used a 486/66DX2 (i.e., a speed doubled 486-33MHz) system with the
original release of the GIMP well over a year ago. The new version
benefits a great deal from the added power of the Cyrix P166
(133MHz) system I currently use. The equation for computer graphics
is simple: faster CPU + more memory = reduced frustration.</p><p>The GIMP does not at the time of this writing have direct
support for scanners, tablets or pen devices. Work is currently
underway on a generic scanner interface (called SANE) which
includes a plug-in for use with the GIMP. This plug-in is not part
of the base distribution at this time. I expect that scanner
support will be much more extensive for the GIMP by the time this
article reaches the newsstand.</p><p>Support for Wacom tablets is also in the works. A number of
contributors have the Wacom ArtZ working with XFree86, and a couple
of individual projects were started to integrate the tablets with
the GIMP using the X Input Extension. Recently (in June 1997),
these projects began to merge. Again, by the time this article
reaches the newsstand, this support should be much more extensive.
It is interesting to note that Wacom is a commercial supporter of
the XFree86 project. At the time of this writing based on
information from their web sites, neither the MetroLink nor Xi
Graphics X servers appear to support Wacom tablets.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2975580.0x2a6e9a0"></a>Disk Space Requirements</h2></div></div><p>The version of the GIMP that I use, the developers 0.99.10
release, requires approximately 19MB of disk space for the runtime
files. This includes about 11MB for the binary, 5MB for the various
plug-ins and about 2.5MB for the libraries and data files, such as
patterns, brushes and so forth. The source code takes up
approximately 11MB uncompiled.</p><p>Working with images is very disk space intensive&mdash;this means
that you need to have a lot of disk space for all the images you
will be creating or manipulating. You also need space for
variations of images, photos from archives to use as starting
points for creating your images and a number of copies of the same
image in different formats. Managing all the files alone could be a
full-time job (and in large media shops, it is a full-time job), so
be aware that in the long run you may need to add hard disk
space.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2975580.0x2a6eb00"></a>Moving On</h2></div></div><p>Now that you know a little about what the GIMP is, where to
get it and what type of hardware and software requirements and
support it has, you're ready to look at the application itself.
Next month we'll discuss some basic features such as file I/O,
dialog windows and cursors. Each of these topics could fill a
chapter in a book, but we're going to try to cover them in one
article. So hang on, we're just getting started.</p><p><a href="2388s1.html" target="_self">References</a></p></div></div>
