    Why one petroleum company decided to use Linux for its new point of
    sale computers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x18c7450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Why Linux? Because it works. Because it
does the job. Because, let's face it, it's free.
</p><p>In late 1993, we started doing preliminary design work on a
new retail petroleum point of sale (POS) unit. Basically, it's an
electronic cash register (ECR) which also handles credit cards and
controls fuel dispenser systems. We wanted to design a PC-based
system to leverage the ease of availability and low prices
associated with PC hardware.</p><p>Our sister division in the Netherlands had already began
designing a new POS system for the European market. Since they had
provided major components of our current successful products, we
waited in heady anticipation for their design documents.
Unfortunately, their design was based on MU-DOS, a multitasking DOS
by Digital Research. We weren't very happy, and started researching
alternative operating systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x18c7608"></a>Requirements</h2></div></div><p>We had the following requirements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Soft real time: While we didn't need a true real
time system, we did need an operating system which would be able to
handle over a dozen serial ports. These ports weren't always
active, but we'd have bursts of communications from 9600 baud and
higher, and we needed to be responsive in processing the incoming
data. We also had to handle an experienced ECR cashier who would be
entering keystrokes at a high rate and expecting a quick system
response.</p></li><li><p>Multitasking: Preferably preemptive. What we really
wanted was protected memory segments, so that one task wouldn't be
able to corrupt another's data space. Being able to use multiple
programs would allow us to change out specific programs without
affecting the rest of the system.</p></li><li><p>Non-proprietary: We wanted an OS and development
system that was supported by an outside agency using industry
standard tools and utilities. We wanted to make our own workload as
small as possible.</p></li><li><p>Inexpensive: The price point we were aiming at for
the product didn't allow too much choice in the way of
software.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x18c7a28"></a>Other Operating Systems</h2></div></div><p>In fairly short order, we had examined a number of candidates
and decided to use SCO Unix w/Chorus Micro-kernel. Linux hadn't
become an option&mdash;yet. We had heard of it, but didn't feel it was
mature enough or commercially acceptable enough to warrant serious
investigation.</p><p>Windows 3.1 still seemed too buggy, Windows NT was too
expensive and too much of a resource hog.</p><p>QNX suffered from a lack of virtual memory. While we didn't
have a real need for virtual memory, we wanted the ability to use
it if the application needed it for some short but highly memory
intensive operation.</p><p>OS/2 was originally high on our list, as our sister division
was also looking at migrating to OS/2 for their product.
Unfortunately, we consistently had problems with installation and
found support extremely difficult to get.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x18c7c38"></a>Deciding on Linux</h2></div></div><p>SCO's only real problem seemed to be pricing. They wanted
much too much, much too soon. While we started negotiating, we
needed to start developing. We didn't want to purchase any SCO
development systems, so we decided to start our development on
Linux. Linux was fairly POSIX compliant, so we were confident we
would be able to port our code without difficulty to another
platform, particularly another Unix platform.</p><p>Differences in usability showed up almost immediately. I was
working on the one SCO system we did have (an evaluation unit) and
found the utility commands to be almost primitive compared to
Linux. Things as simple as the recursive (<b  >-R</b>)
flag were missing from the <span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>chown</b></span> commands. I found myself
locating and acquiring more and more GNU tools. I was unable to get
good or timely support for the SCO C compiler and the C++ front
end. (They didn't have a native C++ compiler at the time.) I had
difficulty in getting quality technical support. I had plenty of
their time, but kept talking to support personnel who were not
close enough to the module for which I needed information. I
continually had to bother my SCO sales representative to renew my
support contract (which was free due to the on-going
negotiations).</p><p>On the Linux side of the partition, life was much smoother.
The utilities were very advanced, the documentation reasonably good
and the Linux newsgroups were a wealth of information and
solutions. We tried using the SCO newsgroups, but found that,
unless someone had experienced the exact same problem, little help
was forthcoming. Linux newsgroups allowed us to contact the actual
authors and maintainers of specific areas of code to better
understand and troubleshoot problems. They were also fast. Within a
matter of a day or two (sometimes less) we had fixes, workarounds
and suggestions to try. It was almost like having a bunch of Linux
experts on our payroll.</p><p>While upper management continued negotiating with SCO,
engineering started quietly hoping that we could stay with Linux.
However, we still had that commercial issue. We were afraid our
customers wouldn't accept a free &ldquo;hackers&rdquo; OS. Luckily, Linux
just kept gaining momentum. Linux 1.0 came out during this time,
and suddenly companies like Caldera were making this wonderful OS a
commercial product.</p><p>Suddenly, using Linux wasn't quite the issue it had been the
previous year. Our customers still weren't sure, but their
technical people started giving grudging acknowledgement that Linux
just might be okay in a product. We decided to stay with Linux and
drop SCO, who still wanted too much, too soon&mdash;we've never looked
back.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17cf580.0x18c7fa8"></a>Today</h2></div></div><p>Currently, we've got Linux 2.0, demand loadable kernel
modules and connectivity to Windows, Novell and AppleTalk. Most
importantly, we never hear the words, &ldquo;Hmmm, it looks like an OS
problem.&rdquo; We still have the occasional problem with an application
or utility, but it's rarely anything critical, and, if it is, we
always have the source code and access to the author.</p><p>We aren't the only retail petroleum POS vendor to come up
with a PC-based solution. We are, however, the only Unix-based one.
There have been attempts based on Windows 95, OS/2 and even DOS. So
far, no one's really succeeded. Our product will hit the streets
around mid-year (1997). It's already done wildly better than
expected in its first field trials. We have confidence that it's
going to be a winner, due in large part to Linux.</p></div></div>
