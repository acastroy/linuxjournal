    This article gives us a quick lesson in creating new images
    from old.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc9b580.0xd933f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the best kept secrets on the World
Wide Web is how GIF images are created in real time or &ldquo;on the
fly&rdquo;. Some of the reasons for creating GIF images on the fly
include highlighting a map image, combining several images into one
(similar to the layers feature in CAD packages) and even making
virtual postcards.
</p><p>My reason for developing programs to create GIF images on the
fly was for a campus map that would highlight important locations.
That is, when anyone visited our campus map web page and selected a
certain building or site to locate, we wanted to highlight that
particular site in some way.</p><p>As with most projects, all of the details had not been worked
out in advance, so I chose a development route that would save me
time&mdash;I decided to write a program to automate the task.
Programming is more fun for me than editing 100 or more images,
especially when people tend to change their minds. It turns out
that the development time was not dramatic, and when modifications
were requested, it was a trivial task.</p><p>In this article, I simplify my project and outline the steps
to create a new GIF image by adding an arrow to an existing image.
You need to be familiar with CGI programming in Perl as well as
HTML. You do <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> have to be an expert.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc9b580.0xd93660"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>First, download and install the items listed below.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Perl</b></span>: This is the
programming language we will use. For CGI programs, I typically
start out with a Perl program and then migrate to C if the speed of
the program becomes the bottleneck. You will need at least version
5.002 of Perl. Download it from http://www.perl.com/perl/, if you
do not already have it installed. There should also be pointers to
the Windows 95/NT version of Perl at the URL above. As far as I
know, all Perl implementations are free.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>GD.pm interface</b></span>:
This interface provides the graphics commands to do the GIF image
manipulation. It was developed by Lincoln Stein and is based on the
gd C library developed by Thomas Boutell
(http://www.boutell.com/gd/). You can get GD.pm at
http://www-genome.wi.mit.edu/ftp/pub/software/WWW/GD.html for
free.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Web server</b></span>: This
example was developed on the Apache 1.2 web server. However, as
long as the web server allows you to write CGI scripts in Perl, and
Perl is installed as a CGI language, it should work. You can get
Apache at http://www.apache.org/ for free. There are other freeware
and commercial web servers, but Apache gets my vote for best web
server on a Unix platform.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>cgi-lib.pl library</b></span>
(optional): This is a set of Perl routines for reading input from a
form. If you plan on accepting input from a web form to generate
the GIF image, you need this or a similar package. cgi-lib.pl can
be downloaded from http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/cgi-lib/ for free.
Similar packages are available, but cgi-lib.pl is my personal
preference.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc9b580.0xd93be0"></a>Example #1</h2></div></div><p>Once you have all the packages installed, you are ready to
create your first CGI script that uses GD.pm.</p><p>In the first example, we read in two GIF images: a main image
and an arrow image. Based on input from the user, we &ldquo;place&rdquo; the
arrow on the main image. Last, we display the final image.
<a href="2411l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> shows the source code
for this example.</p><p>Line 2 requests the use of the GD interface and Line 3
verifies that we are using Perl 5.002 or higher. Line 5 includes
the routines from cgi-lib.pl for reading form input. One of those
routines, <b  >ReadParse</b>, is used in Line 6 to get
the form input data. The data from this form is stored in the
associative array named FORM.</p><p>Next, Lines 8-11 set up variables which include the filenames
for the main and arrow images. In addition, the variables for
placement of the arrow on the main image are assigned default
values, if they are not provided from a web form or other
technique. I will show an example of passing variables to a script
later.</p><p>Lines 13-15 and 17-19 do the same thing. The first set reads
the main image into a variable called <b  >$main</b>. The
second set reads the arrow image and stores the image in the
variable <b  >$arrow</b>. In each set, you will notice a
routine <b  >newFromGif GD::Image(GIF)</b>. This is the
GD function that reads an image from the file and stores it into a
variable. The nice thing about this routine is that it does not
require image dimensions, although you probably want to know
them.</p><p>Line 21 does most of the work in the script. It takes the
arrow image and stores it at the x-pixel position $FORM{xp} and the
y-pixel position $FORM{yp} on the main image. The last four
parameters for the function define how much of the arrow image is
copied. In our case, all of the arrow image was copied onto the
main image.</p><p>Finally, Lines 23 and 24 output the image as if it were being
called from an HTML file and Line 25 ends the script.</p><p>Now, we need to call the script to generate the image. You
can do this in a couple of ways. First, just call the CGI script
directly from a web browser like Netscape. An example URL would be
http://bodock.vislab.olemiss.edu/cgi-bin/example1.cgi.</p><p>Calling the script would simply display the image on the
screen. You can also put this URL in an IMG tag of an HTML file
like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;IMG SRC=
"http://bodock.vislab.olemiss.edu/cgi-bin/example1.cgi"
ALT=""&gt;
</pre><p>Last, you can modify the URL slightly to specify an x,y
position for the arrow image. An example URL within an IMG tag
would be as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;IMG SRC="/cgi-bin/example1.cgi?xp=10&amp;yp=40"
alt=""&gt;
</pre>


Notice I took off the full URL. Doing this assumes that the CGI
script is on the same machine as the web page.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc9b580.0xd94268"></a>Example #2</h2></div></div><p>The next example uses a few more of the functions supplied
with the GD interface. We draw the arrow rather than read it from a
file. By drawing the arrow, we can control the angle of the arrow
which is drawn on the main image. <a href="2411l2.html" target="_self">Listing
2</a> shows the source code for this example.</p><p>Lines 1-8 should look familiar from the previous example. We
simply define variables for the main GIF image and the
position/angle of the arrow. Just for simplicity, I did not include
the <b  >ReadParse</b> routine, so no user input is
allowed. As in the first example, we read the main image into the
variable <b  >$im</b> in Lines 10-12.</p><p>Line 15 is new. This line simply allocates a color based on
RGB values which range from 0 to 255. The color blue has a RGB
value of (0,0,255). We can then use the color later when drawing
the arrow.</p><p>Lines 17 calls the function for creating the arrow. This
routine starts on Line 26. In this routine we create a new polygon
(an arrow) and then spend most of the time finding the points for
the polygon. After we find an x,y position for a corner of the
polygon, we put it in the polygon object,
<b  >$poly</b>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, our polygon is an arrow. Line 37
creates the polygon variable. Then Lines 38-44 find points for the
polygon. Here is how that section works. Lines 33-34 define the x,y
positions for an arrow that points north. Since we may want to
rotate this arrow, Lines 38-44 come into play. These lines figure
out the new x,y positions of each point taking the rotation angle
into consideration. Line 43 adds the point to the polygon taking
into consideration the size of the image (subtracting 75) and the
x,y position where the arrow will be placed
(<b  >$xpos</b> and <b  >$ypos</b>). Rather
than spending all day trying to explain this section of the code,
take a look at an old CGA graphics book. In fact, I got the
formulas for this section from a CGA graphics manual.</p><p>At last, we have a polygon stored as the variable
<b  >$poly</b> which is returned to the main program.
Line 19 is another GD interface call to fill the arrow with our
color and place it on the main image. Finally, the image is
displayed and the script exits.</p><p>Like the first example, you can call this CGI script both
directly and via an IMG tag as shown here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;IMG SRC=
"http://bodock.vislab.olemiss.edu/cgi-bin/example2.cgi"
ALT=""&gt;
</pre><p>If you want to dynamically control the angle of the arrow,
you would need to modify this example to include the cgi-lib.pl
library, read in the data with <b  >ReadParse</b> and
then define <b  >$angle</b> appropriately.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc9b580.0xd94948"></a>A Little More Detail</h2></div></div><p>We now know how to create a GIF image on the fly and view it
both directly and from an IMG tag within an HTML file. What if you
need to save the image?</p><p>Of course, first of all you need a directory where the images
will be created. Depending on your web-server configuration, the
ownership and write permissions of that directory will need to be
modified so that the CGI program can save the image. Discuss this
matter with your webmaster.</p><p>Once that issue is resolved, your CGI script can output the
image to a file using a unique, file-naming scheme. To recall this
file name, you can use a database or simply inform the client of
the name of the file. For example, if you develop a CGI program to
create virtual postcards, the only person who needs the name of the
image is the sender and/or the recipient of the postcard. This
could be displayed within the web browser once the postcard has
been created or e-mailed to the recipient. In other situations,
several people may need to view the image. In this case, a database
for storing the file name with the associated options is the best
choice in my opinion.</p><p>In either case, storing the image can be done in addition to
displaying it. That is, just use regular Perl I/O statements to
print the image to a file. Pick up any Perl programming book and
check out the File I/O section.</p><p>Last, you might have to keep a watch on the directory where
the images are stored. If the file names are unique and the images
are large, consider deleting old files periodically to avoid buying
a new disk each month. Then again, you might want to use that as an
excuse to obtain more disk space.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc9b580.0xd94bb0"></a>For Further Information</h2></div></div><p>Of course, the documentation that comes with GD.pm can fill
in any gaps that you might have. In addition, here are two URLs
that show some of my programming work in creating GIF images on the
fly. The first is a campus map for the University of Mississippi
(UM). The second example highlights a few interesting sites about
my home state.</p><p>For the UM campus map, the original GIF creation programs are
written in C and use the gd C library. You can visit that page at
the URL http://www.olemiss.edu/hospitality/maps/. The
<b  >Find</b> option at the top of the page will take you
to other web pages. From there, you can select a site of interest.
With a simple mouse click, an image is displayed of the campus with
an arrow to highlight your selection. In addition, all the
information on each building is listed in a database, so the CGI
program has to first get this information before the image is
created.</p><p>A more elaborate example of GIF images created on the fly can
be found at the URL http://bodock.vislab.olemiss.edu/onthefly.html.
This combines several options such as text, a choice of colors, a
variety of pointers, etc. Be sure to follow the &ldquo;More Practical
Example&rdquo; link at the bottom of the left-most frame. That section
shows examples of adding several text and highlighters at the same
time. In addition, the map is clickable thanks to some HTML code
for a a client-side image map. The CGI programs for this
application were developed with Perl and the other packages
mentioned earlier.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc9b580.0x118d010"></a>In Closing</h2></div></div><p>As with any development project, everyone has their opinion
of the best package to use. I have been very satisfied with the gd
C library and the GD.pm interface for creating GIF images on the
fly. You may find other packages or interfaces that suit your needs
better depending on your experience and your web server
platform.</p><p>My only advice comes originally from my Dad, but slightly
modified for the nineties and GIF image creation: &ldquo;Never use a
wrench (image editor) when an air ratchet (programming with GD.pm)
can do the job.&rdquo;</p></div></div>
