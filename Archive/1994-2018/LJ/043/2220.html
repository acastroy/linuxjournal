Implementation</em></span> is an introductory book designed for
people who have already dealt with the basics of programming. When
reading this book, a knowledge of both C and assembly language is
helpful but not required. In particular, not knowing assembly will
not prevent you from understanding the book, but it may slow you
down.</p><p>The first chapter of the book is an overall introduction to
the topic of operating systems. It starts with an explanation of
what an OS is and a short historical summary on the evolution of
operating systems. Then, the basic concepts of operating systems
are explained and the different possible structures for an OS are
introduced. The introduction ends with an overview of the remaining
chapters of the book.</p><p>The style of the authors is very straightforward, making the
information easy to follow and understand. The text doesn't get
side-tracked into irrelevant topics, a problem found in many text
books.</p><p>Another strong point of this book is that it is not only a
theoretical introduction to operating systems programming but a
practical one as well. The included CD-ROM contains MINIX 2.0
complete with source code and several simulators for non-Intel
machines. The code is meant to be backward compatible with
processors as old as the 8088, so if there's an old machine
gathering dust in the basement, it can still be put to use for
experimenting with the concepts covered in the book. The
theoretical and practical parts of the book are well-balanced and
easy to separate, so that one may use the book only for the
theoretical parts or only for the practical parts.</p><p>Installing MINIX from the CD-ROM is not too hard, but if you
have done installations before, the experience will help. The
installation instructions have some minor inaccuracies, but a log
file from an installation done by Andrew Tanenbaum is also
provided, which clarifies the situation.</p><p>The chapters following the introduction each deal with a
specific concept of OS programming. Chapter 2 is dedicated to
processes, Chapter 3 to I/O, Chapter 4 to memory management and
Chapter 5 to file systems. Each of these chapters starts with a
description of the concept and the theory behind it. The chapter
then continues to detail how the concept is realized in MINIX. This
part of the chapter follows the source code line-by-line explaining
what is being done by the corresponding piece of code.</p><p>Another practical side of the book is that all the code
explained is contained in Appendix A, which means that there is no
need for piles of printouts or a screen when one is trying to
follow the description in the book.</p><p>Every chapter is followed by exercises that provide for good,
practical implementation of the topics discussed.</p><p>The book ends with a suggested reading list ordered according
to the concepts described in the book.</p></div></div>
