AcceleratedX CDE with Display Server $274.95US</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Bradley Willson</p></li></ul></div><p>The &ldquo;X inside inside X&rdquo; logo flashed on the screen then
quickly went away. What happened next gave me cause for
celebration. My old NEC Multisync II flashed graphics faster than
ever before. My 9FX Vision 330 card was among more than 449 other
video cards that AcceleratedX reportedly supports. I also found a
&ldquo;closer&rdquo; match to my ancient monitor's specs among the 100 plus
list of supported monitors and generic settings. I had more control
over colors and display than ever before. While talking to
pre-sales tech support, I found there are more features available
that my hardware does not support. High-end equipment can support
the 8/24 bit display and gamma correction features.</p><p><a href="2486f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. CDE
Toolbar</b></span></a></p><p>Before testing the new server, I loaded a copy of
<span   class="bold"><b>xbench</b></span> and ran it on my stock
configuration of the X312_S3 server and FVWM95-2. I used the xbench
default parameters that run each test three times for ten seconds
per run. I performed the same test on AcceleratedX, then compared
the results. Overall process times averaged thirty percent faster
with the AcceleratedX server.</p><p>Next, I loaded the AcceleratedX Common Desktop Environment.
My initial euphoria faded at that point, and I began to pack up the
pointy hats and party favors. The act of installing CDE had
clobbered the display server installation, and there was nothing in
the documentation that warned me otherwise. A quick e-mail
conversation with tech support confirmed the importance of sequence
and included an assurance that they would add an addendum to their
release notes to warn users of this requirement. I reinstalled the
display server and resumed testing.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that the X Windows
configuration was also modified. The X386 directory was copied to
X386.old and then re-populated per CDE specifications. Other
directories like fvwm95-2 were removed from the parent directory
altogether. Another annoyance came from the way CDE bypasses
loading /etc/profile. None of my scripts worked. /sbin,
/usr/local/bin and /usr/local/sbin were no longer in the path.
After making some symbolic links to the missing directories and
editing path statements, the system was back up and running, mostly
as it was before. A few more words need to be added to the release
notes to help customers configure their systems for test-driving
CDE.</p><p><a href="2486f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Application Builder</b></span></a></p><p>Hindsight is a great tool, if only it could be applied in
reverse. I wanted to retain my configuration while testing the new
software. The philosophy behind CDE does not take that scenario
into account. It is fully intended to be the primary X window
manager on the system, with <span   class="bold"><b>twm</b></span> as
the failsafe. When the opportunity presents itself again, I will
load these packages after the kernel and before adding any other
applications. That way the configuration will remain consistent
throughout.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131f580.0x1417c38"></a>Description</h2></div></div><p>The CDE's front panel is impressive at first sight. Ten
frequently used programs and utilities are placed for first
priority use. Other, less-used programs are embedded within pop-up
menus. The workspace manager is placed front and center, configured
with four unique workspaces. An &ldquo;LED&rdquo; flashes to indicate a
process is in work. A padlock icon launches a session display lock.
The panel can be positioned anywhere on the desktop and be
minimized or maximized with buttons on the panel ends. The package
includes several backgrounds, screen-savers and desktop color
schemes, making it easy to customize each workspace according to
individual taste.
</p><p><a href="2486f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. Style
Manager</b></span></a></p><p>The CDE features several useful applications, including a
multi-user planning calendar with drag and drop appointment
scheduling and to-do items, a file manager similar to
<span   class="bold"><b>xfm</b></span>, a simple text editor with
spell checking, a MIME capable mail handler, a graphic printer
manager, an application manager with numerous other utilities and
the quintessential trash bin. There is even a Motif application
builder for the programmer types. The multi-function calculator
serves the financial, programmer and scientific users with the
click of a button. Even the xterm is configurable on the
fly.</p><p>To customize a control, one simply clicks on the icon with
the right mouse button and then selects &ldquo;Add Sub-panel&rdquo; from the
pop-up menu. The sub-panel is then ready to accept new application
and utility items. Sub-panels and applications are removed in the
same manner. The only drawback is additional controls have to be
added by the system administrator by editing text files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131f580.0x1417f50"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p><a href="2486f4.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 4. Help
Viewer</b></span></a></p><p>The installation process for both packages is simple and
reasonably straightforward. The CDE installation consists of
mounting the CD and running
<span   class="bold"><b>dtinstall</b></span>. The script takes care
of the file copy and administrative tasks in one step. The display
server installation is explained in the user's manual. The process
entailed changing to a specific directory, decompressing the
package from two floppy disks and running two scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131f580.0x14181b8"></a>Technical Support</h2></div></div><p>Xi Graphics' technical support can be summed up in two words,
quick and effective. Send your inquiry to support@xinside.com or
support@xig.com. If you just need information, send a note to
info@xig.com. You will receive an automated reply with a generous
helping of information texts and FAQs that are available from their

with, since I normally take the &ldquo;free&rdquo; route. When compared to
XFree86, it shows definite signs of improvement. The wide variety
of supported hardware makes this product a better choice in
high-demand environments and with aging equipment. I found CDE to
be easier to set up and administer in a networked environment than
XFree86. The robust selection of built-in applications add value to
any system. The printed manuals are laid out in a logical fashion,
making it easy to find most of the answers. The on-line help is
more graphical than <span   class="bold"><b>xman</b></span>, but the
information is focused on helping the user, not the system
administrator. In general, I liked AcceleratedX and the Common
Desktop Environment. I certainly recommend it for mission-critical
commercial applications and for the &ldquo;serious&rdquo; home user.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131f580.0x1418528"></a>Company Profile</h2></div></div><p>Xi Graphics, Inc. is located in Denver, Colorado, and employs
