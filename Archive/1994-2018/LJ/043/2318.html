getting started to advanced topics such as calling C from Perl and
using Perl with C.</p></li></ul></div><p>Jon Orwant is a Motorola Fellow at the MIT Media Laboratory
and is the Editor-in-Chief of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Perl
Journal</em></span>. His vast experience with Perl is reflected in
the book.</p><p>The practical extraction and report language (Perl) was
designed by Larry Wall using concepts and constructs from sed, awk,
C and Unix shell tools.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>PERL 5 Interactive Course</em></span> is one of
eight books from Waite Group providing interactive web-based
learning assessment (the other titles are: <span   class="emphasis"><em>HTML
3</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>C++</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Visual Basic
Scripting Edition</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Java</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Visual Basic 5</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Office 97</em></span>)
and on-line resources through the eZone at
http://www.waite.com/ezone/. Buying the book gives you free access
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>The PERL 5 Interactive Course</em></span> on the
eZone.</p><p>The book's fourteen chapters and eleven Appendices, with
reference material, teach Perl programming using Perl 5.</p><p>Each chapter contains eight training sessions with reading
material and examples on the topic, a quiz and graded exercises
(easy, medium, moderate and difficult) to reinforce the learning
process. The chapters are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Meeting Perl: The Basics</p></li><li><p>Pattern Matching: Regular Expressions</p></li><li><p>The Outside World: Files and Filehandles</p></li><li><p>Divide and Conquer: Subroutines</p></li><li><p>Mincing Words: Hashes</p></li><li><p>Looks are Everything: Formats</p></li><li><p>hOOPla: Object-Oriented Programming</p></li><li><p>Browsing the Libraries: Modules</p></li><li><p>Pushing the Envelope: Process Management</p></li><li><p>When Good Programs Go Bad: Debugging</p></li><li><p>Lock and Key: Security and Databases</p></li><li><p>Surfing on Oysters: Perl and the World Wide
Web</p></li><li><p>Spreading the Word: Networking</p></li><li><p>Tower of Babel: Perl and Other Languages</p></li></ol></div><p>The pace of each chapter is aggressive. For example, Session
1 of Chapter 1 begins with the classical programming
assignment&mdash;&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;, and by Session 8 of Chapter 1 the
subjects of scalars, conditional statements, loops and arrays have
already been covered. (A minor editing error&mdash;the legends for the
figures in Chapter 1 are off by two&mdash;the caption for Figure 1-1 is
more appropriate for Figure 1-3, for example.)</p><p>PERL 5 Interactive Course contains a wealth of reference
information in the appendices. The appendices are:</p><p>A. Quiz Answers</p><p>B. Internet Resources</p><p>C. The ASCII Character Set</p><p>D. Unix Signals (incorrectly identified as Symbols in the
Table of Contents)</p><p>E. File Tests</p><p>F. Debugger Commands</p><p>G. Operator Precedence</p><p>H. Command-Line Flags</p><p>I. Perl Special Variables</p><p>J. Regular Expressions</p><p>K. A Summary of Functions</p><p>(A minor editing error&mdash;all references in the text to
appendices is off by one&mdash;references to Appendix I actually refers
to Appendix J, for example.)</p><p>The CD-ROM contains all the scripts for the projects
developed in the book (over 400 programs) as well as the following
tools:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Perl 5 binaries or source for Unix, Windows 95 /
Windows NT and DOS/Windows 3.x</p></li><li><p>Contents of the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
(CPAN)&mdash;tools, scripts, resources and other material. (Note: may
not be readable by DOS/Win3x systems.)</p></li><li><p>Netmanage Chameleon Sampler (free for 30 days,
thereafter the copy must be registered for $50 US&mdash;you must make
arrangements with an ISP for Internet access). The book fails to
mention that you only need Netmanage Chameleon with DOS/Win3x,
since all other operating systems (OS) come with Internet Access
Tools as an integral part of the OS.</p></li><li><p>Sample of eZone content available on the Web
(you'll need Netscape 2.0 or Microsoft Explorer 3.0 or later to
view).</p></li></ul></div><p>There is a section before Chapter 1 on how to install the
tools and set up your system to effectively use the PERL 5
Interactive Course learning material. There is a section for each
major OS (Unix, Win95/WinNT and DOS/Win3x). I tested the CD-ROM on
a Windows NT 4.0 Workstation system using the FAT16 file system.
The INSTALL.BAT program provided failed to complete the install
properly. I was able to manually install the CD-ROM on my system
performing the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>I created a directory named &ldquo;perl&rdquo; in my root
directory.</p></li><li><p>I created a directory named &ldquo;bin&rdquo; in the perl
directory.</p></li><li><p>I copied the file from the CD-ROM directory
/perl5/win95-nt/091-i86.zip to my root directory, and then
installed it with the command <b  >PKUNZIP -d C:\perl</b>
(to preserve the zipped directory structure).</p></li><li><p>I copied the file from the CD-ROM directory
/perl5/win95-nt/nt5091sr.zip to my root directory, and then
installed it with the command <b  >PKUNZIP -d
C:\perl</b>.</p></li><li><p>I copied the file from the CD-ROM directory
/perl5/win95-nt/ntperl5.091.ppc.zip to my root directory, and then
installed it with the command <b  >PKUNZIP -d to C:\</b>
(perl is already in the path).</p></li><li><p>I copied the programs perl.exe and perlglob.exe
from c:\perl\5.001\src\ntt to the c:\perl\bin directory.</p></li><li><p>I updated my path to include the c:\perl\bin path
for the Perl program and added a new environment variable,
<b  >PERL5LIB=c:\perl\5.001\lib</b>, to pick up the
&ldquo;require&rdquo; library files.</p></li></ol></div><p>Perl comes with a test script (c:\perl\5.001\src\ntt est.bat)
to assure that the install was performed properly and the Perl
interpreter is functioning properly. I found that this script did
not execute properly as installed, but with the skills I learned
from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>PERL 5 Interactive Course</em></span>, I was able
to make the script work properly and check out the install. The
test routine is not documented, but there is a verbose option
(<b  >-v</b>) which produces very detailed output during
the testing phase (learned this from reading the code).</p><p>The on-line eZone resources (http://www.waite.com/ezone/)
guide you through the registration process
(<b  >Initiate</b> icon), course enrollment
(<b  >Learn</b> icon), monitor course progress (Chapter
and Session tests, and progress tracking on exams) and award final
Certificate of Completion. Registration authentication is done by
entering a particular word from a particular page of the book. The
on-line quiz asks the same questions included in the book at the
end of each session&mdash;the advantage of on-line access is automated
scoring and progress tracking. The on-line scoring must be used to
obtain the Certificate of Completion. The eZone also provides
access to a Mentor area for your course, where you can get personal
help (<b  >Mentor</b> icon) through existing Frequently
Asked Questions (FAQs) or by posting your question. In addition the
eZone provides a Tools and Resources section
(<b  >Chill</b> icon) for your course. The tools and
resources available are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a mailing list for the course</p></li><li><p>a reader newsletter</p></li><li><p>resources on the subject matter</p></li></ul></div><p>I did access and print the readers' newsletters,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The eZone Newsletter</em></span>, for February (14 pages),
March (16 pages) and April (15 pages) 1997. The newsletters keep
you informed of developments on the eZone, new courses and provide
a summary of key discussions from the mailing lists. The April 1997
ezone Newsletter reports that these courses are now available for
Continuing Education Units (CEUs) through Marquette University
(http://www.mu.edu/).</p><p>The web site also includes the Perl 5.0 eZone Club House
which archives past mail on the mailing lists and makes it
available for searching and access. A few of the vast Perl
resources linked from this page that I checked out were: The Perl
Language, Index of CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network),
Perl 5 WWW page&mdash;Perl 5 Information, Announcements and Discussion
and the HTML version of Rex Swain's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Perl 5 Reference
Guide</em></span> (23 pages).</p><p>Overall, I would rate this book as a best buy&mdash;the
comprehensive coverage of the uses of Perl in this one volume would
make this a frequently used desk reference. I have seen similar
material, but it has been in several different books that address
particular applications of Perl. This book provides a wide
assortment of applications of Perl in one place.</p></div></div>
