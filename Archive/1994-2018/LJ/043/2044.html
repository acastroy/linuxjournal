    HylaFAX and Linux are used to provide a powerful, freeware
    alternative for faxing from a Mac network.
    </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2044f1.large.jpg"><img src="2044f1.jpg"></a></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119f580.0x12975b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Part of my job at the publishing company
where I work is finding new ways to finish time-consuming jobs more
quickly. After implementing an on-line order entry system and a Mac
file server, I set up an e-mail/dial-up router for a remote office.
The staff did a lot of faxing which consumed a huge amount of time
that could have been better spent doing other tasks. The small 486
we used didn't have enough horsepower to handle fax conversion, so
I didn't try to use it for that job. After the power supply fan
quit and the machine died, I decided to get a more powerful machine
and set up a fax server.</p><p>We ordered a 133 MHz Pentium 5 for the new server. It has an
Ethernet card and two modems to eliminate fighting for the
telephone line. One modem is used for the PPP dial-up, and one is a
Class 2.0 fax-modem. Most fax-modems implement only Class 1 fax
transmissions, which require the computer to do most of the
processing, but Class 2.0 frees up those resources.</p><p>I had used the HylaFAX software a few years before and knew
it could easily handle the volume of faxes that we send. More
importantly, it was within my budget. By using Linux and other free
software, I had the money for hardware and another phone
line&mdash;money that would have otherwise been spent on expensive
software.</p><p>HylaFAX uses Ghostscript to convert faxes from PostScript to
the tagged image file format (tiff), as faxes are sent over the
line in a form of tiff. One of the most important things to do is
make sure that the Ghostscript software is set up correctly and has
the tiffg3 driver enabled. Without this driver, you will spend a
long time wondering why you can't finish the HylaFAX setup.</p><p>Originally, I just wanted to be able to fax a certain set of
documents. Part of the way through the setup process, I found a
Macintosh extension called MacFlex that allows a Mac to print to
the fax server as if it were a printer. After you choose print,
MacFlex asks for the phone number and spools the document to the
server. It is well-written software that has produced more &ldquo;oohs&rdquo;
and &ldquo;ahhs&rdquo; in the office than the server, and it is available
from http://www.eats.com/.</p><p>In order for the users to send documents to the fax server
from their own Macintoshes, Netatalk was installed. Netatalk lets
you share Linux drivers with Macintosh machines. These drivers show
up in the Chooser like any other server.</p><p>After installing and testing Ghostscript and finding the
location of the executables and fonts, it's time to get HylaFAX.
Download information and documentation is at
http://www.vix.com/hylafax/. Most of the configuration consists of
setting paths to reflect the directory structure of your system.
After the software is installed, another round of configuration is
done to set up the modems. First, the program
<span   class="bold"><b>faxaddmodem</b></span> probes the modems to
determine the manufacturer, speed, class and other information.
Then, in a send-only environment, the program faxmodem is run to
tell the daemon that a new modem exists. I could never get the
faxmodem program to work correctly, so I ran the program
<span   class="bold"><b>faxgetty</b></span> on the correct serial
port. faxgetty is a specialized version of
<span   class="bold"><b>getty</b></span> that reports status
information on the modem to the fax daemon.</p><p>The program included with HylaFAX to queue outgoing faxes
uses a command-line interface. Since the users of the system were
accustomed to Macintoshes, I didn't think they should have to learn
Unix just for the purpose of sending their faxes. Therefore, I
wrote a Web front-end to HylaFAX that allows them to select one or
more documents from a list and choose to send it to a distribution
list or to an individual.</p><p>After getting HylaFAX completely installed and running, I
thought the worst was over. However, HylaFAX comes with a default
cover page that includes the Silicon Graphics logo, and we already
had a nice cover page I wished to continue using. I know a small
amount of PostScript, but 1 megabyte of machine-generated
PostScript is nearly impossible for me to decode. After trying
unsuccessfully for half a day to change the default to match our
cover page, I looked through the information on the HylaFAX web
site mentioned above and found more helpful instructions on
constructing the cover page. I removed a graphic from the default
cover page that cut the size of the PostScript file from 1MB to
about 100K. This version was much easier to modify, and I had it
going in about an hour. The cover page on the web site is a
template that the program <span   class="bold"><b>faxcover</b></span>
fills in. In order to put in the place holders that faxcover needs,
you must open the PostScript version of the cover page in a text
editor and insert the correct fields. Checking the cover page for
appearance is difficult, since the blanks show up empty in a
PostScript viewer unless you first run faxcover and put in some
test data. Doing this just makes a version of your cover page for
you to look at&mdash;it does not send any faxes.</p><p>Overall, the project was a success. After a few minor
problems, the system is chugging away handling IP masquerading,
UUCP over TCP and out-bound faxing. The total hardware cost was
under $2000US. I spent nearly 60 hours writing the front-end
software<a href="2044foot.html" target="_self">(1)</a> and making sure all
the other pieces worked together correctly. The time required to
send a fax dropped from 10 to 15 minutes to about 30
seconds.</p></div></div>
