    This is a follow-up article to the author's &ldquo;IP Masquerading
    with
    Linux&rdquo; in <i  >Linux Journal</i> Issue 27.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f9580.0x26f13a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over a year ago this magazine graciously
allowed me to write a couple of articles for them. One of them
concerned the topic of IP Masquerading (July 1996, Issue 27) as
supported by the Linux kernel. Since that time a number of changes
have occurred during the ongoing development of Linux. I'd like to
bring the <i  >Linux Journal</i> readers up to date on
what changes have taken place, explain a few of the technical
details and take some guesses at where things are going in the
future. Many of the technical details of functionality will not be
revisited because overall the functionality hasn't changed. The
previous article still applies in that area.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f9580.0x26f1500"></a>Recap</h2></div></div><p>IP Masquerading is a way of performing address hiding. It may
be that a company does not have enough registered IP addresses to
connect all of its computers to the Internet or, if you're like me,
you have one address through a local dial-up account, but three
computers. Each of these circumstances can be solved by using
masquerading to allow the &ldquo;internal&rdquo; computers access via the one
external connection point. The external connection point will use
masquerading to hide addresses. Figure 1 is a diagram of the local
network I have as my setup.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2352f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Masqueraded Network Diagram
</p></div></div><p>Using masquerading is still as easy as ever. I have one
network where I want all of my hosts to have access to the
Internet. Since they are on 192.168.1.0 (the network), I can
masquerade the entire class C address space. You'll notice, being
the good administrator that I am, I'm using a private address as
defined by RFC 1918.</p><p>To start masquerading, I defined an rc.masq file in my
/etc/rc.d/ directory and added it to execute in /etc/rc.d/rc.local.
The rc.masq file looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
#
PATH=/usr/local/bin; export PATH
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
#
#       setup system forwarding policy
ipfwadm -F -p deny
#
#       masquerading rules
ipfwadm -F a m -S 192.168.1.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0
#
#       list out the current ruleset
ipfwadm -F -l -n,
</pre><p>First, you'll notice the command to set up masquerading is
the <span   class="bold"><b>ipfwadm</b></span> (version 2.3.0)
command. This is noticeably different from the previous article
when only the <b  >ipfw</b> command could be used. Since
kernels 1.3.66 <b  >ipfwadm</b> is the only command to
manipulate masquerading rules and is available from
http://www.xos.nl/linux/ipfwadm/.
</p><p>There are really just two statements given. The first
one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipfwadm -F -p deny
</pre><p>defines the forwarding policy (<b  >-F</b>) of this
machine&mdash;deathstar from Figure 1. It sets the policy to deny all
packets to be forwarded by deathstar. Forwarding is the situation
where a packet has a source address and destination address
different from any of deathstar's interfaces and is to be routed
through.
</p><p>The second statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipfwadm -F -a m -S 192.168.1.0/24 -D 0.0.0.0/0
</pre><p>added a masquerading rule for the source
(<b  >-S</b>) network 192.168.1.0. We can tell it is for
the entire network by the 24-bit netmask associated with it. 24
bits equates to 255.255.255.0 to indicate the network versus the
host portion of an IP address. The destination
(<b  >-D</b>) address is the all encompassing 0.0.0.0
network, which is used to identify any network. That's it.
</p><p>The last command allows me to look at the rules set for
deathstar. The output looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
IP firewall forward rules, default policy: deny
type  prot source           destination   ports
acc/m all  192.168.1.0/24   0.0.0.0/0     n/a
</pre><p>Briefly, the output indicates that it will masquerade for all
protocols from source 192.168.1.* to anywhere for all source and
destination ports.
</p><p>The <b  >ipfwadm</b> program is primarily used to
set the rules for the firewalling code in the Linux 2.x
kernels.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f9580.0x26f1f50"></a>Setting up</h2></div></div><p>Masquerading takes a small amount of effort to get
configured. Before kernel 2.0.30 the masquerading code was still
considered experimental. As such, many pieces of the code were not
included with the full distribution, but only included as patches.
If you are running a 2.0.x kernel where is x is 29 or lower, see
the &ldquo;Code Maturity Level&rdquo; sidebar for patching the kernel to
include masquerading. My kernel is set up running version 2.0.30
with masquerading included. The configuration options related to
masquerading are shown in <a href="2352l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>.</p><p>You'll notice that parts of the masquerading code can only be
included as kernel modules. These are for specific protocols or
applications; examples include FTP, VDOLive and Real Audio.</p><p>Currently, IP Masquerading has support for TCP and UDP, FTP,
Real Audio, IRC, ICMP (configuration option), VDOLive, CUSeeMe and
Quake. Normal TCP and UDP applications like TELNET or DNS are
supported directly in the kernel masquerading code. The abnormal
(i.e. pathological) protocols such as FTP and IRC (which have IP
addresses as a part of the message stream) and Real Audio (because
the control protocol needs to know where you are) are supported via
kernel modules. VDOLive, CUSeeME and Quake are also kernel
modules.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f9580.0x26f2160"></a>Some Considerations</h2></div></div><p>The ipfwadm command, as mentioned, is used to set up the
forwarding rules for masquerading. It's also used for creating the
firewall and accounting rules also supported by the Linux kernel.
While we won't worry about that aspect here, it should be noted
that firewall administration and IP masquerading can be tightly
coupled depending upon what task you are attempting.</p><p>As well as setting the rules, ipfwadm allows you to view the
current status of any masqueraded connections. For example, the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfwadm -M -l -n
</pre><p>gives the following output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
IP masquerading entries
prot expire   source       destination    ports
udp  03:31.50 192.168.1.5  164.109.1.3    1110 (61009) -53
udp  03:36.67 192.168.1.5  164.109.1.3    1112 (61011) -53
tcp  14:06.91 192.168.1.5  207.79.74.21   1304 (61016) -80
tcp  14:07.17 192.168.1.5  207.79.74.21   1303 (61015) -80
tcp  14:05.62 192.168.1.5  207.79.74.21   1302 (61014) -80
tcp  01:44.79 192.168.1.5  204.192.48.81  1301 (61013) -23
</pre>


The <b  >-M</b> option is used for masquerading
administration and is only used with the <b  >-l</b> or
<b  >-s</b> options. The <b  >-l</b> option
provides the selected (in this case, masquerading) list. As you can
see, the output listing shows the originating port number and the
masqueraded port number in parentheses going to the destination
port. Our traffic shows three DNS queries, three HTTP connections
and a TELNET connection currently established.
</p><p>The expire column pertains to the timers associated with
masquerading. A masqueraded packet will have an expiration time if
no further traffic is seen. TCP connections have two timers. The
first one for the masqueraded connection and the second one for
when the FIN segment is received. Each of these timers can be set
with the <b  >-s</b> option of ipfwadm. TCP connections
have a default timeout value of 15 minutes and UDP, a timeout value
of 5 minutes. You can change the values by giving a command such
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfwadm -M -s 1200 60 120
</pre><p>This command signals that TCP connections expire after 20
minutes of inactivity, a 1 minute expiration after receiving the
FIN segment and 2 minutes for UDP entries. The default values will,
in most cases, work well.
</p><p>When I added the rule to masquerade the 192.168.1.0 network,
I could have indicated which interface masqueraded traffic would be
sent and received. I could have extended the command as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipfwadm -F -a m -S 192.168.1.0/24 \
        -D 0.0.0.0/0 -W ppp0
</pre><p><b  >ppp0</b> is the interface name for the
204.192.48.109 address. While this name is optional for our
example, it becomes necessary to give it if the masquerading
machine has more than one internal network connection. For example,
suppose deathstar had two Ethernet connections for networks
192.168.1.0 and 192.168.2.0. Without the <b  >-W</b>
option, traffic between the two internal networks would also be
masqueraded causing a great deal of confusion.
</p><p>I chose to deny all packets that were to be forwarded as my
default policy using the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipfwadm -F -p deny
</pre><p>You are allowed to set up the default policy as
<b  >masquerade</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfwadm -F -p masquerade
</pre>


This command masquerades all connections going out and those coming
in. In other words, if a host on the network external to the
masquerading machine sets up a route to the internal network, they
can send packets and set up connections (even ping) to internal
machines. The danger is clear&mdash;your network is no longer hidden.
</p><p>A certain problem did arise with the 2.0.30 kernel and
ipfwadm. The IP masquerading code includes entries in the
/proc/net/ip_masquerade file for ICMP as shown in
<a href="2352l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>. ipfwadm has a problem
with this and will give the following error:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipfwadm -M -l -n
IP masquerading entries
ipfwadm: unexpected input data
Try ipfwadm -h for more information.
</pre><p>This problem will be taken care of in the near future.
</p><p>One last option to ipfwadm that I find useful is the
<b  >-o</b> option, which turns on kernel-level debugging
for matched packets according to rules set by
<b  >ipfwadm</b>. Note however, this option is only
effective when the kernel option for CONFIG_IP_FIREWALL_VERBOSE is
selected.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f9580.0x26f2c60"></a>Protocols</h2></div></div><p>As we've noted, some protocols are simply incompatible with
the basic concept of masquerading. Support exists for a few of the
more popular ones&mdash;FTP, CUSeeMe, VDOLive, IRC and Quake. A few
applications/protocols still exist that are not supported by the
2.0.30 distribution. These include talk, the &ldquo;R&rdquo; programs such as
<span   class="bold"><b>rsh</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>rlogin</b></span>, Mplayer and other
games.</p><p>A great replacement for the &ldquo;R&rdquo; programs is
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> (Secure Shell). It functions
as a direct replacement for rsh, rlogin and
<span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span>, as well as support for X11
sessions. Its main provision is for secure communications and
strong authentication; however, since it is TCP based, it works
quite well with masqueraded hosts. This program is highly
recommended for remote communications in general.</p><p>IP Masquerading does a very good job of hiding the internal
network. If it is hidden, no one can get to you, right? Maybe this
isn't a particularly desirable situation. Incoming connections can
make sense for resources such as a web server, anonymous FTP server
or e-mail. It could be that your Linux host could function for all
of these services, and more than likely you would want to proxy
incoming mail anyway. If you have a requirement for an internal web
server, a couple of programs are available to forward or redirect
traffic bound from the external host to an internal host. The
simplest is the <span   class="bold"><b>redir</b></span> program
updated by Nigel Metheringham and available from
sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/system/Network/daemons/redir-0.7.tar.gz.
<b  >redir</b> is a TCP port redirector that resides on
your masquerading host waiting for connections on a port and
redirected to an internal server. A simple example to redirect HTTP
and log all connections is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# redir --syslog 192.168.1.5 80 80 &amp;
</pre><p>You can also start redir from inetd for more convenience.
</p><p>Every once in a while I'll have X terminals redirected from
machines on the outside sent to &ldquo;yoda&rdquo; internally (when I'm not
running ssh). I typically have X running on &ldquo;deathstar&rdquo;, so I use
ports above 6000 for the redirection. For example, I set up the
redirection in this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# redir --syslog 192.168.1.5 6001 6000 &amp;
</pre><p>And on the external host I would send the xterm display to
port 6001.
<pre     class="programlisting">
xterm -display 204.192.48.109:1.0 &amp;
</pre>


You wouldn't want to open this up to everyone, so it's probably a
good idea to implement a couple of firewall rules about incoming
traffic to the masquerading host to restrict who could connect to
you or start redir from inetd and use something like tcpd to
restrict connections.
</p><p>For UDP traffic there are a few programs available to
redirect traffic from external to internal hosts. udpspoof
(http://www.america.com/~chrisf/web/udpspoof.c) and udprelay
(ftp://ftp.wang.com/pub/fitz/udprelay-0.2.tar.Z) are good ones.
Probably the most popular though is ipautofw, which is generic
enough to handle both TCP and UDP traffic. It is implemented in the
Linux kernel as a part of the 2.0.30 kernel, and it is also a
command interface to set up auto-forwarding rules. It's available
from ftp://ftp.netis.com/pub/members/rlynch/ipautofw.tar.gz.</p><p>The ipautofw command sets rules in the /proc/net/ip_autofw
file to automatically forward packets for masqueraded hosts. For
example, in order to handle Real Audio traffic before the kernel
module was implemented, you could use ipautofw to give the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipautofw -A -r udp 6970 7170 -c tcp 7070
</pre><p>This associated a TCP control connection (-c&lt;\!s&gt;7070)
with a range of return UDP packets, ports 6970 through 7170
inclusive.
</p><p>Now, suppose we had that web server behind our masquerading
host. We could add an auto-forwarding entry such as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ipautofw -A -r tcp 80 80 -h 195.168.1.5
</pre><p>This command forwards HTTP requests to yoda (195.168.1.5).
However, ipautofw is only able to fulfill one request at a time. As
long as a masquerade entry exists for that connection, all other
connection requests are sent TCP &ldquo;resets&rdquo; until the timer
expires. This is not a good scenario for a web server.
</p><p>Redirecting traffic to more than one host is another problem
with masqueraded redirections. Many sites have multiple web servers
internally and use them to load balance the traffic. None of the
utilities I've listed so far support this situation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f9580.0x26e9d88"></a>Fragmentation</h2></div></div><p>IP Fragmentation used to be a problem with masqueraded
connections. Because the follow-on fragments contained no transport
(TCP or UDP) header information, the datagram could not be
correlated to an existing connection. The option for &ldquo;always
defragment&rdquo; from the configuration menu is shown here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
IP: always defragment (CONFIG_IP_ALWAYS_DEFRAG)
[N/y/?] (NEW) y
</pre><p>This option will cause fragmented datagrams to be reassembled
at the masquerading host rather than at the destination.
</p><p>Still, the notion of performing reassembly in the &ldquo;middle&rdquo;
of data transfer goes against the general principle of IP delivery.
Other methods exist to help eliminate fragmentation. Two of these
are MSS negotiation and path MTU discovery.</p><p>MSS (maximum segment size) negotiation is an area where IP
Masquerading could improve. What I mean by this is best shown in an
example.</p><p>From Figure 1, let's look at the TCP traffic generated during
a connection open from the machine called falcon to an external
machine. Listings 3 and 4 shows the traffic.</p><p><a href="2352l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>. TCP three-way
hand-shake traffic from falcon to deathstar on 192.168.1.0.</p><p><a href="2352l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>As we can see, the MSS advertised from the masqueraded
connection (1326) is exactly the same as the one sent from the
original host, falcon. The catch here is how I set up the PPP
connection from deathstar to the PPP server. I set the MTU to be
296 knowing fragmentation would occur if the connection was not
handled properly. A method of handling that takes advantage of the
MSS to eliminate fragmentation is for deathstar, the masquerading
host, to readjust the MSS based on knowledge it has of the next hop
connection. An MSS of 256 (i.e. 296-40) is more appropriate.</p><p>You may also notice the (<b  >DF</b>) field in the
traffic from Figure 4. This is the &ldquo;Don't Fragment&rdquo; bit in the IP
header. It indicates that if a datagram must be fragmented on its
way to the destination, it will be discarded and an ICMP error
message sent back to the source. Path MTU discovery is usually
responsible for setting the <b  >DF</b> bit. It does so
in order to look for those ICMP error messages, and if found, it
will adjust how much data is put into a TCP segment and resend. A
host will continue to do this until a segment size can be found
such that the Maximum Transmission Units of all of the data links
between the source and destination can accommodate the datagrams
without fragmentation.</p><p>Given the multitude of methods for overcoming fragmentation,
it is no longer a problem in masqueraded networks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f9580.0x26ea360"></a>Network Address Translation</h2></div></div><p>A network address translator (NAT) device is one which
performs address hiding. A NAT works on relationships that can be
1:1, many:1 or many:n; it also allocates addresses for external use
statically or dynamically.</p><p>Instead of having a single ISP assigned IP address, a user or
company may have an entire class-C, address space. However, the
internal network might still be large. With NAT, addresses could be
assigned for different functions. For example, assume 199.1.1.0 is
the address we have. Further, assume we are using 172.16.0.0
through 172.31.255.255 for our internal networks. We could assign
the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>199.1.1.1-10: permanent addresses assigned outside
of NAT device</p></li><li><p>199.1.1.11-25: statically assigned to corresponding
internal addresses 172.16.1.11-25</p></li><li><p>199.1.1.26-254: dynamically assigned to remaining
internal addresses</p></li></ul></div><p>IP Masquerading is a many:1, static allocation case of
NAT</p><p>Linux 2.1.x kernels now have support for NAT as a marked
entry in the routing table. A full-featured implementation is
rumored to be implemented sometime during the 2.1.x development.
For many of the abnormal protocols that IP Masquerading already
supports, NAT will have to go through the same growing pains.
However, it should lead to a more feature-rich and flexible
address-hiding environment.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25f9580.0x26ea7d8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Although the basic functionality has stayed the same, IP
Masquerading has progressed tremendously in the past year. Support
for new protocols and better handling of old problems have evolved
it from experimental status to a fully functional part of Linux
kernels. It solves many real world problems for many people and
will continue to do so. During the evolutionary development of
Linux it may happen that NAT will replace the work that has
preceded it, but until then I highly recommend this amazing piece
of technology.</p><p><a href="2352s1.html" target="_self">Code Maturity Levels</a></p><p><a href="2352s2.html" target="_self">Glossary</a></p><p><a href="2352s3.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
