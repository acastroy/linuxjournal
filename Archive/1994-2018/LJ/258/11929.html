Where are the potential bottlenecks in scaling a Web app, and what can
you fix?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265d580.0x27553b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I started discussing how to optimize a Web application,
looking at the different aspects of an app and where the slowness
might come from. I described several different factors that
can lead to a Web application feeling slow for the end user: network
speed and latency, server application speed, client-side loading and
rendering, and finally, the execution of the client-side JavaScript
programs. Each of those factors contributes to the feeling of speed
that a user gets when using a Web application, and it's our job as
engineers to try to reduce them.
</p><p>
So in this article, I cover a number of the places where you can look to
try to reduce the problematic times that I described&mdash;that is,
specific areas of your application that might be slow and might
well need some tuning or improvements. In my next article, I'll look at
specific programs and techniques you can use to identify problematic
spots in your applications and, thus, help them improve.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265d580.0x27555c0"></a>
Where Do You Look?</h2></div></div><p>
One of the most infuriating things someone can say to a
programmer is &ldquo;It doesn't work.&rdquo; What doesn't work? What did it do
yesterday? What causes the computer to stop working? When people say
to me that their system &ldquo;doesn't work&rdquo;, and then expect me to find the
problem, I suggest that such a statement is similar to going to a
doctor's office and saying, &ldquo;It hurts me somewhere.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Similarly, if you're going to find the bottlenecks and slow-moving
parts in your system, you're going to need to look at various parts of
it and consider how much they might be contributing to the slowness.
Only after thinking about the individual parts and understanding what
about each of them might be slow, can you then try to fix any problems
you might have.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265d580.0x2755828"></a>
Infrastructure</h2></div></div><p>
I'm not a hardware guy; I often joke that I reach my limits when I
change a light bulb. That said, there's no doubt that understanding
your hardware, at least a bit, is going to help you optimize your
software.
</p><p>
It used to be that the major consideration for software developers was
the speed of the CPU on which programs ran. However, for modern Web
applications, I/O speed and memory are far more important.
</p><p>
Your application&mdash;especially if it's written in a high-level
language, and even more so when the application is under heavy load&mdash;will consume a large amount of memory. As a result, you're going to
want to load up on RAM. This is also true for your database; the best
way to kill a database's performance is to start using virtual memory.
If your server is using the disk because it ran out of RAM, you're
going to suffer from a massive performance hit.
</p><p>
By contrast, if you can give your database a large amount of memory,
it will be able to cache more data in RAM and not have to go to
disk nearly as often. If you're using PostgreSQL for a database, 
setting the &ldquo;shared buffers&rdquo; and &ldquo;effective cache
size&rdquo; parameters are
crucial, in that they tell the database how much memory it can expect
to use. This helps the PostgreSQL server figure out whether it
should jettison data that it already has cached or load additional
data into the shared buffers.
</p><p>
This also points to the advantages of having multiple servers, rather
than a single server. If you're running a small Web site, the
RAM requirements of your HTTP server and your database server might
well clash. This especially will manifest itself when you get a lot
of traffic. Your HTTP server will use more memory, but so will your
database, and at a certain point, they might collide. Using more than
one computer not only allows you to scale out the Web and database
servers more easily, but it also ensures that neither will interfere with
the other.
</p><p>
The other factor to consider, as I mentioned above, is I/O. Again,
I'm not a major hardware expert, but you want to consider the speed of
the disks that you're using. Today, as people increasingly move to
ritualized servers in which the underlying hardware is abstracted
away, it's sometimes hard to evaluate, let alone choose, the hardware
on which your systems are running. Even if you can't do that though,
you can and should try hard to avoid putting any production-level
system on a shared machine.
</p><p>
The reason is simple. On a shared machine, the assumption is that each
application will play nicely with the others. If one application
suddenly starts to crunch through the disk a great deal,
everyone's I/O suffers. I experienced this when working on my PhD
dissertation. My software would back up its database once per hour,
and the managers of my university's computer cluster told me that this
was causing unacceptably slow performance for other users. (We
found a way to back up things in a way that was less resource-intensive.)
</p><p>
The question that many people used to ask about servers was &ldquo;Buy or
build?&rdquo;&mdash;meaning, whether you should create your own special-purpose
server or buy one off the shelf. Today, very few companies are
building their own servers, given that you're often talking about
commodity hardware. Thus, the question now is &ldquo;Buy or
rent?&rdquo;
</p><p>
I must say that until recently, I was of the opinion that having your
own server, on which you have relatively full control, was the way to
go. But I must admit that after working on several scalability
projects, I'm warming up to the idea of deploying a swarm of identical
VMs. Each individual VM might not be very powerful, but the ability
to scale things up and down at the drop of a hat can more than
outweigh that need.
</p><p>
The bottom line is that when you're looking into servers, there are
(as always) many different directions to explore. But if you think
that your system might need to scale up rapidly, you should
seriously consider using a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; platform. More important
than the CPUs is the amount of RAM and ensuring that your virtual machine is
the only user of your physical machine.
</p><p>
Oh, and how many servers should you set up? That's always a hard
question to answer, even if you know how many users you expect to have
visit. That's because servers will behave differently under different
loads, depending on a wide variety of factors. No matter what, you
should give yourself a comfortable margin of error, as well as have
contingency plans for how to scale up in the case of wildly successful
PR. In my next article, I'll discuss some strategies for figuring out how
many servers you'll need and what sort of margin to leave yourself.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265d580.0x2755f08"></a>
HTTP Server</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have some hardware, you need to consider your HTTP server.
This is a matter of taste, personal preferences and considerable
debate, and it also depends in no small part on what technology you're
using. For many years, I have used Apache httpd as my Web server&mdash;not because it's super fast, but because it's very easy to configure
and has so many plug-in modules available. But, even I must admit that
nginx is far more scalable than Apache. The fact that Phusion
Passenger, a plugin for both Apache and nginx, works with both Ruby and
Python and is trivially easy to install convinced me to switch to
nginx.
</p><p>
Whereas Apache uses multiple threads or processes to handle its
connections, nginx does so using a single thread, in what's known as
the &ldquo;reactor pattern&rdquo;. As such, it's generally much more scalable.
</p><p>
If you're trying to remove potential bottlenecks in your system, then
having a high-powered HTTP server is going to be necessary. But of
course, that's not enough; you also want the server to run as quickly
as possible and to be taxed as little as possible.
</p><p>
To make the server run faster, you'll want to examine its
configuration and remove any of the modules you don't really need.
Debugging is great, and extra features are great, but when you're
trying to make something as efficient as possible, you're going to
need to trim anything that's not crucial to its functioning. If
you're using Apache and are including modules that make debugging
easier and faster, you should remove them, keeping them (of
course) in your development and staging systems.
</p><p>
You also want to tax your HTTP server as little as possible, so that
it can concentrate its efforts on servicing HTTP clients. There are a
number of ways to do this, but they all basically involve ensuring
that requests never get to the server. In other words, you'll want to
use a variety of caches.
</p><p>
Within your application, you'll want to cache database calls and
pages, so that someone who requests a page on your system turns
to the HTTP server only if it's really necessary. Modern frameworks, such
as Rails and Django, are designed to let you cache pages in an external
system, like memcached or Redis, such that requesting /faq from your
server will be served from the cache instead.
</p><p>
Beyond the caching that you'll want to do in your application, you
probably will want to put a front-end Web cache, such as Varnish,
between your servers and the outside world. In this way, any static
asset (such as JavaScript, CSS or images) that users request will
come from that cache, rather than having to go to the server.
</p><p>
Going one step further than this, in a move that a growing number of
large sites are making, you could (and probably should) use a content
distribution network (CDN), on which your static assets reside. In
this way, someone who goes to your site hits your server only for the
dynamic parts of your application; everything else is served by a
third party. Your server can spend all of its time worrying about the
application itself, not all of the stuff that makes it pretty and
functional for the end user.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x265d580.0x2756380"></a>
Database</h2></div></div><p>
Another point of great debate, as well as a bottomless pit (or, if
you're a consultant, an endless opportunity!) of work, is that of
databases. Whether you're using a relational database, a NoSQL
database or a combination of the two, all databases are massively
complex pieces of software, and they need a great deal of configuration,
care and attention.
</p><p>
Actually, that's not true. You can, in many cases, get away with not
tuning your database configuration. But if you want to scale your
system up to handle high load levels, you're going to want to
keep as much of the database in memory as you can and tune your
queries as much as possible.
</p><p>
You're also going to want to ensure that the database is doing the
best job it can of caching queries and then of results. Databases
naturally do this as much as they can; keeping query results in memory
is a way to boost the speed. But many databases let you configure
this memory and also tune the ways in which it is allocated.
PostgreSQL, for example, uses its statistics (collected via VACUUM) so
that it'll know what should stay in memory and what can go. But at
the application level, you can cache queries and their results, 
allowing the application to bypass the database completely and, thus,
lighten its load.
</p><p>
There is another complication when it comes to databases, namely the
fact that so many modern Web application frameworks generate SQL for
you automatically using object-relational mappers (ORMs). It's true
that in most cases ORM-generated SQL is more than adequate for the
task, and that the overhead of generating SQL on the fly and of the
many object layers required to do so, is worth the cost.
</p><p>
But, there are numerous cases in which ORM-generated SQL was not very
efficient, often because the programmer's assumption didn't match that
of the ORM. A classic example of this is in Ruby on Rails if you
retrieve numerous objects from the database after a query. From the
Ruby code, it feels like you're just iterating over a large number of
objects. But from the SQL side, each object over which you iterate is
firing off SQL queries, potentially clogging the database.
</p><p>
Using a slow-query log or logging (as PostgreSQL allows) all queries
that take longer than a certain minimal threshold is a great way to
start looking for the things that are taking a long time in the
database.
</p><p>
But even then, you might not find your performance problems. I 
recently was working with clients, helping them optimize their
database, which we found was taking a very long time to execute a lot
of queries. And yet, when we looked in the logs, nothing was written
there. The problem wasn't that each individual query was taking a
long time, but that there was a huge number of small queries. Our
optimization didn't speed up their query, but rather replaced a
&ldquo;for&rdquo;
loop, in which the database was queried repeatedly, with a single,
large query. The difference in execution speed was truly amazing, and
it demonstrated that in order to debug ORM problems, it's not enough to
know the high-level language. You really do need to know SQL and how
the SQL is being executed in the database.
</p><p>
In some cases, there's nothing you can do to prevent the
application from hitting the database&mdash;and hitting it hard with lots
of queries. In such cases, you might well want to use a master-slave
model, in which all of the read-only queries are directed to a set of
slave (read-only) databases, and write queries are directed to a
master server. Master-slave configurations assume that most of the
queries will be reading, not writing, and if that's the case for your
system, you're in luck.
</p><p>
If that's not the case for your database, and master-slave doesn't do
the trick, your solutions will be limited by the database you're
using. Some offer master-master replication, giving you multiple
databases to which you can send write requests. Some of them,
especially in the NoSQL world, shard automatically. But no solution
is perfect, and especially when it comes to master-master replication,
things can get a bit dicey, even for the most experienced database
hands.
</p><p>
The bottom line is that your database is quite possibly going to be
the biggest bottleneck in your system. Try to keep the application
away from it as much as possible, caching whatever you can. And, try
to keep the database tuned as well as possible, using the current best
practices for the system you're using, so that it'll be working at
peak performance.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I talked about the basic, high-level places where
there might be problems with scaling a Web application. Here, I
discussed, in greater detail, what sorts of things you can do when your
application is showing, or might be showing, scaling issues. Next
month, I'll look at some specific tools and techniques that you can
use to understand how scalable your application is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> hordes of
users come and use it.

The 2nd edition of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Art of Scalability</em></span>, by Martin Abbott and
Michael Fisher (published by Addison-Wesley), describes in great
detail the different parts of a Web application and the ways 
you can and should scale it up. They describe a thought process,
rather than a set of technologies, for analyzing the architecture of a
Web application. If this is a subject that is of interest to you, 
it's likely worth reading this book.
