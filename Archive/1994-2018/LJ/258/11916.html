Hash Tables</h4><p>
Regarding Mihalis Tsoukalos' article &ldquo;Hash Tables&mdash;Theory and
Practice&rdquo; in the August 2015 issue:
thank you very much for your interesting article about this important data
structure. It was well written and illustrated with programming examples. However, the
results of ht1.c and ht2.c (execution time vs. table size) are not
surprising.
Since the hash function of ht1.c uses only the first character of the key, there
are effectively no more than 26 different outcomes of the hash function. Since
each result maps to one bucket (which are all different in the best case of no
collisions), no more than 26 buckets will be employed. Once
<tt  >tablesize</tt> exceeds
26, there will be no increase in performance at all (26 being the number of
uppercase ASCII characters).
</p><p>
As for ht2.c, the same effect is expected at a table size of about 500, assuming
a maximum word length of, say, 20 and a maximum contribution of 26 per character,
yielding roughly 26 x 20 different outcomes of the hash function. In practice,
the limit should be observed even earlier. This is what we see in the diagrams.
</p><p>
Better results with respect to table size scaling can be expected using the
following hash function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int hash_3(char *str, int tablesize)
{
#define MAX_LEN     6
static int v[MAX_LEN] = {1, 26, 26*26, 26*26*26,
&#8618;26*26*26*26, 26*26*26*26*26};
int value, i;
if (str==NULL)
{
return -1;
}
value=0;
for (i=0; *str &amp;&amp; i&lt;MAX_LEN; i++, str++)
{
value += (toupper(*str) - 'A' + 1) * v[i];
}
return value % tablesize;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Provided a large table size, this function has up to 0.3 billion different
outcomes (26<sup  >6</sup>), at a slightly higher computation
cost. Increasing <tt  >MAX_LEN</tt>
beyond 6 is possible but demands 64-bit integer arithmetic.

Slay Some Orcs</h4><p>
Thanks for Shawn Powers' &ldquo;Slay Some Orcs&rdquo; article in the
August 2015 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
</p><p>
In addition to the mentioned Steam and Desura on-line game stores, I also suggest
looking at GOG (<a href="http://www.gog.com" target="_self">www.gog.com</a>). Although most of its titles are old
(GOG stands for Good Old Games), there are some current games including Linux ones. If both
GOG and Steam have a game, I usually purchase it from GOG because all of
its
games are DRM-free and you don't need to run a distribution client (like Steam)
to run the game.
</p><p>
Three games I would add to your list:
</p><p>
1) <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em></span> (Steam and GOG): a modern
strategy/adventure game in
the style of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baulder's Gate</em></span>.
</p><p>
2) <span   class="emphasis"><em>Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em></span> (Steam): the Linux version is out. With an
article title like &ldquo;Slay Some Orcs&rdquo;, how could this one be
missed? Lots of Orc to
kill here. (But there's an out: the article was written before the Linux version release.)
</p><p>
3) <span   class="emphasis"><em>Dominions 4: Thrones of Ascension</em></span> (Desura): old-school, very deep, turn-based
strategy.
</p><p>
I'd also like to suggest a monthly half-page &ldquo;Linux Games
Update&rdquo; column.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Richard   <br><br>
</p><p>
Richard,
thanks for the links and also for the column idea. If nothing else, I'll
try to be more game-aware in my UpFront pieces. Please don't hesitate to
send me game recommendations.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Using MySQL for Load Balancing and Job Control under Slurm</h4><p>
Regarding Steven Buczkowski's &ldquo;Using MySQL for Load Balancing and Job
Control under Slurm&rdquo; in the August 2015 issue: I have a question on the queuing system to process big data. If you're using MySQL on
different nodes, how are you dealing with each system's data locking? Or, is the DB
on the head node and you're just running via client access on the nodes? It
would
be good to hear your setup, but I like the idea.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Gary   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Steven Buczkowski replies:</b></span>
Ahhh, you got to the problem faster than I did. I was still a fairly
naive slurm user when I originally put this idea together, and it turns
out, I was trying to populate the db under slurm (that is, on multiple
nodes, simultaneously...). Somehow, I managed to escape having that come
back and bite me as resource contention for some time. I don't
understand how I managed that for so long.
</p><p>
When I did start having trouble, I tried a number of mutex-like things
to let the first instance of my process populate the db while the other
spawned instances blocked until this was done: all very ugly and very
inefficient use of the cluster resources.
</p><p>
In the end, the cleanest approach was to do the db
population <span   class="emphasis"><em>outside</em></span> the sbatch call (that is, on the head node) and 
start the parallel processing only once the stack table was built. The
problem here is that I was keying the table off the slurm process
ID, and on the head node, we don't have access to that
yet. The solution was to have a wrapper script that first generates a
random number to use as a slurm procID proxy to build the table, then
kicks off the table build with that ID, then starts sbatch and passes
that random number in to my processing script as either a command-line
parameter or as an environment variable via sbatch's
<tt  >--export</tt>
keyword. The table pop process keys off this random number,
but the table updates when closing out a process can add the real
procID if you want that for accounting purposes.

Welcome to Issue 10000000? Really?</h4><p>
I'm probably not the first one to write about it, but it would seem that
Shawn Powers
erred when he said &ldquo;Welcome to issue 10000000&rdquo; (August 2015
issue). He most likely meant &ldquo;Welcome to
issue 100000000.&rdquo; It's okay, we all make miskates...uh mistakes, I meant.

Binary Fail</h4><p>
No matter how many times I count them, I can find only seven zeros behind the
one. I read that as binary 10000000 or hexadecimal 80, aka decimal 128. But the
cover says Issue 256. I could not believe that slipped by so I counted them
again&mdash;still seven.
Ooops.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Bonnie Packert  <br><br>
</p><p>
Pierre and Bonnie,
never before have I gotten so much e-mail as when I miscounted zeros in
issue 256! Truly, people e-mailed me, Tweeted at me and even
instant-messaged me! Of course, you are both correct, and I made a silly error. I
guess if I'm going to make a mistake, I'd rather it be something silly like
that as opposed to something in an instructional article.
</p><p>
But yes, I totally dropped the ball on that one&mdash;or maybe the
zero!&mdash;Shawn Powers

Gettin' Sticky with It</h4><p>
Regarding Shawn Powers' &ldquo;Gettin' Sticky with It&rdquo; in the June
2015 UpFront section: just a comment about listing the attributes of a directory. In the article, the
following command was given:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l / | grep tmp
</pre>
</p><p>
You could use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ls -ld /tmp
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-d</tt> option makes it list the directory and not the contents.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> is the only mag that I've continued enjoying since its beginning.
Thanks for the good work of keeping Linux and its special features in focus.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Dan   <br><br>
</p><p>
Cool, thanks Dan! I never knew about the <tt  >-d</tt> flag. Also thanks for the great
compliment!&mdash;Shawn Powers

&ldquo;What Does Fast Mean?&rdquo;</h4><p>
I think you made a mistake here [see Reuven M. Lerner's &ldquo;What Does
Fast Mean?&rdquo; in the September 2015 issue]:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Let's now replace that high-speed wire with a satellite link.
Suddenly, because it takes time to send the data from one network to
another, you have decreased your latency while keeping your bandwidth
identical.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Shouldn't this be <span   class="emphasis"><em>increased</em></span> your latency?
Other then that, it was a great read.
