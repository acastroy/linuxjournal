OPSWAT's Metascan</h2></div></div><p>
For years companies have been using Metascan from OPSWAT to catch
threats reliably on files entering their organizations. Metascan, whose latest
release also nabs threats to Linux systems, is a multi-scanning solution
for ISVs, IT admins and malware researchers that detects and prevents known
and unknown threats. The multi-scanning feature consists of multiple
anti-malware engines from vendors like Bitdefender, ESET, Threat Track and
others, a technology that increases detection rates for all types of
malware without the hassle of licensing and maintaining the multiple
engines. Myriad 64-bit Linux distributions are supported, including Debian,
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS and Ubuntu. As part of its enhanced
scalability, Metascan for Linux provides load balancing for high-volume
scanning and can be used in high-availability deployments. Another
important enhancement is the flexibility of the scan workflows, allowing
different scan options by file type and source to offer increased security
and threat prevention.

Opera Software ASA's Opera Browser</h2></div></div><p>
The most significant advancement in Opera 31, the updated, multiplatform
browser from Opera Software ASA, is its startup time. Opera for computers
now starts up to 70% faster compared to previous versions. This is
especially important and helpful for devices with slower, traditional hard
drives. Opera's developers also redesigned pages in the browser to make
everything look sleek. In complement, Opera's Discover, a feature that
serves users the most recent local content, has been given a makeover and
now can be customized based on topic category and location. Finally,
synchronization across devices also has been expanded and improved,
allowing users to access their bookmarks, Speed Dial sites and tabs from
anywhere.

Brian P. Hogan's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Exercises for Programmers</em></span> (The Pragmatic
Bookshelf)</h2></div></div><p>
One of the best ways to learn a programming language is to solve real
problems with it. That's what Brian P. Hogan's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Exercises
for Programmers: 57 Challenges to Develop Your Coding Skills</em></span> is all about.
Instead of questions rooted in theory, this book from Pragmatic
Bookshelf presents problems readers encounter in their day-in-day-out
software development. These problems are designed for people learning their
first programming language and also can provide a learning path for
experienced developers to learn a new language quickly for their next
important gig. The 57 exercises in Hogan's book start off simply and
conclude with larger programs that synthesize everything. Each problem
includes constraints and challenges to push readers further and force them
to come up with the solutions. After learning one new language, readers 
later can work through the book again, using new approaches to solve familiar
problems.

David Cook's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Robot Building for Beginners</em></span>, Third Edition (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
In the third edition of his popular book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Robot Building for
Beginners</em></span>, author
David Cook distills a lifetime of tinkering with robots so that his readers
can get a head start on the fun, fulfilling process. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Robot
Building</em></span> 
serves up essential, practical knowledge on getting
started in amateur robotics and offers a mix of content from serious
reference tables and descriptions to personal stories and humorous bits.
The autonomous robot that readers build in this book is battery powered and
the size of a lunch box. The book is broken up into small chapters,
suitable for bedtime reading. The characteristics and
purposes of each major component (resistor, transistor, wire and motor)
are described and followed by a hands-on experiment to demonstrate. A section
demonstrating how to &ldquo;print&rdquo; certain parts of the robot with a 3D
printer also is included. Because robot building involves soldering,
electricity, light machining and some cash, the writing is targeted
toward individuals with those capabilities.

AdaCore's GNAT Pro for Wind River VxWorks</h2></div></div><p>
AdaCore is taking good care of its GNAT Pro development environment users
on the Wind River VxWorks RTOS. The new GNAT Pro for Wind River VxWorks 7,
which was developed in close collaboration with Wind River, offers full
support for both Ada and the latest version 7 of VxWorks and provides more
seamless integration with Wind River Workbench. AdaCore engineers ensured
that GNAT Pro will support both single- and multi-core systems and other
architectures and added enhancements, such as a completely re-engineered
open-source debugger protocol, support for VxWorks 7 kernel modules and
real-time processes, and the ability to handle both all-Ada and
multi-language applications. AdaCore notes that AdaCore's GNAT Pro is
well established among users of Wind River platforms, especially in the
aerospace and defense markets.

include powerful new search capabilities; more intuitive visualizations of
scans and node changes; node group comparisons; dynamic node

Zappix Visual IVR</h2></div></div><p>
Zappix's development of its Visual IVR customer service app is informed
by research showing that 72% of customers prefer self-service options when
resolving support issues. Zappix is a self-help, highly intuitive,
Visual IVR app for Android, iPhone and Web that integrates voice and
non-voice visual content with customer service channels&mdash;for example, phone/voice,
Web, mobile on-line forms and multimedia resources. An updated version of
the app adds new self-service features that are available while on hold for
customer service and even after a session with a customer service
representative. With these new capabilities, says Zappix, the app reduces
support ticket volumes and the burden on a company's customer service
team. This solution enables a smooth customer-service experience by
answering customer-service issues as quickly as possible. The self-service
technologies benefit both customers and companies, sayeth Zappix, with
companies gaining a cost-effective alternative to live agent support and
customers empowered to solve problems effectively on their own.
