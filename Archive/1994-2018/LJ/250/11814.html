Being a geek means more than sitting at a keyboard, although
admittedly that's part of it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xefc580.0xff4358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've been writing for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> since 1997.
Through the years, I've
gotten hundreds of e-mails from readers and fellow geeks, but never do I
get as much e-mail as when I talk about the geek lifestyle. Whether I'm
discussing my network-connected health monitors or my latest attempt at
emulating console games from the 1990s, there's something about everyday
geek life that is just fun to discuss. For this article, I decided it would be
interesting to start a discussion about health and lifestyle, then follow up a
little later in the month via Twitter, Facebook, Reddit&mdash;or whatever
we decide makes the most sense. I must warn you, I'm not limiting myself
to technology here. Geeks are people too, and it's fun to see how
our geekiness leaks into the rest of our lives!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xefc580.0xff4568"></a>
Work</h2></div></div><p>
First off, let's be honest. We spend a lot of time working. Even when
we're not at work, we tend to be working on work stuff&mdash;work work
work. Thankfully for most of us, technology is what we enjoy, so even
though we spend a lot of time doing it, work is a labor of love.
</p><p>
My day job is that of a teacher/trainer. I create video-based training
for Linux and open-source tools. Because that often means integrating with
multiple systems, it means from my desk I'm within arm's reach of:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
An 11" MacBook Air running OS X Mavericks. (I had Yosemite, but the
Wi-Fi constantly failed, so I went back to Mavericks&mdash;so far, so good.)
</p></li><li><p>
A Wacom Companion tablet computer running Windows 8.1. I use Camtasia
to record the training videos and VMware Workstation to run virtual
instances of whatever systems I'm using to train.
</p></li><li><p>
An Intel NUC machine running ESXi. For some dumb reason, the folks at
Wacom disabled the VT-X capability of the i7 processor on my Companion
tablet, so in order to emulate 64-bit machines, I have to have ESXi
running on a separate server.
</p></li><li><p>
A headless tower running Ubuntu Server 14.04&mdash;because everyone needs
a Linux server handy. I use it locally and over SSH when I'm programming
or testing new software.
</p></li><li><p>
The Polywell i2303 nettop computer I reviewed in June 2012
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournaldigital.com/linuxjournal/201206/?pg=56" target="_self">www.linuxjournaldigital.com/linuxjournal/201206/?pg=56</a>) running
Xubuntu 14.04. This computer is still screaming fast, and I use it as
my main Linux desktop.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I also have a Workrite Ergonomics desk that allows me to stand up or sit
down while working (Figure 1). Sometimes I just raise it and lower
it for fun, because it's truly awesome to press a button and have your
entire workspace rise into the air!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11814f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The motorized lifting desk means I can stand or sit, or 
just play!
</p></div></div><p>
When I'm sitting, I use a Swopper Classic chair to help keep me
active. You know those animal toys at the park mounted on giant springs
so kids can rock back and forth? The Swopper chair is basically an adult
version of that (Figure 2). I can bounce, spin and sway all day
long, and the instability keeps my core muscles active and forces good
posture&mdash;or at least that's what I tell myself. I just like to bounce
all day!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11814f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Swopper chair takes some getting used to, but it really
helps with posture.
</p></div></div><p>
And of course, no office would be complete without hot caffeinated
beverages. This time of year, I tend to drink more tea than coffee. For
Christmas two years ago, my wife bought me the Breville One-Touch Tea
Maker (Figure 3). It makes a perfect pot of tea every time, and it makes
brewing tea as simple as brewing a pot of coffee. I never imagined how
much of a difference it would make, but truly it makes perfect tea every
time, even with delicate white teas.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11814f3.large.jpg"><img src="11814f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

and automatically removes tea leaves.

Play</h2></div></div><p>
I stink at video games. I really do. It doesn't make sense that someone
with such a geeky lifestyle wouldn't be a gamer, but I'm really not. The
only exception to that rule is classic games. I love arcade games, and I
love old-school console games. Thanks to the miracle of emulation, I can
play the NES and SNES games I grew up with on modern hardware. In fact,
in the next couple issues, I'll be writing about my new console emulation
device built inside a cigar box. I can't wait to share it with you!
</p><p>
Most of my playtime is spent reading. My favorite genres are science
fiction and fantasy (big surprise, right?). In fact, I'm already connected
with many of you on-line at <a href="http://www.goodreads.com" target="_self">www.goodreads.com</a>. If
you're a science fiction
or fantasy reader and want to share book insights, please connect with
me (<a href="http://snar.co/goodreads" target="_self">snar.co/goodreads</a>).
</p><p>
If you've been reading <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> for a while, you know that I'm a
big fan of audiobooks. I cover my current favorite audiobook player in the
UpFront section of this issue (the Listen Audiobook Player). I also
read traditional books, but admittedly not as often. For those, I either
buy the dead-tree version or read on my Kindle Paperwhite. I keep my
non-Amazon e-books organized with Calibre and send them to my Kindle
via e-mail whenever I need to load one.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xefc580.0xff5488"></a>
Keeping the Doctor Away</h2></div></div><p>
Anyone who follows me on Twitter or reads my personal blog knows that
during the past year I've had many health problems. The worst of which
was &ldquo;acute renal failure&rdquo;. That was exactly as scary as it sounds. My
kidneys haven't completely failed, and right now, they're functioning at
a steady &ldquo;sorta crappy&rdquo; level. Thankfully, they don't seem to be getting
any worse. Needless to say, it's forced me to take my health a lot more
seriously than ever before. Since I'm a geek, that means I'm trying to
include as much science and technology into the process as possible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xefc580.0xff5640"></a>
Step 1: Weight Loss</h2></div></div><p>
Somewhere around my mid 20s, I started another growth
spurt. Unfortunately, it wasn't the sort of growth a person hopes to
accomplish. I grew both in width and gravitational attraction. One of the
most important body hacks I'm working on is losing weight. While having
a healthy BMI (body mass index) is a good idea anyway, my kidney problems
make it vital that my blood pressure stays under control. Being overweight
increases blood pressure, and since high blood pressure destroys kidneys, it means I have to lose weight.
</p><p>
I probably should take a second to say right now that I'm not advocating
that everyone should do what I do. Our size doesn't define who we are,
and I'm not some vain athlete who is worried about what I'll look like
on the beach this spring. The concept of me being an athlete or wanting
to go to the beach is just insane. Still, I get a lot of e-mail about
my process, so I'm sharing.
</p><p>
The science for losing weight is easy. Burn more calories than you
consume. Sure, there are lots of nuances about carbs and fiber and such, but the math is the math. If you burn more than you consume, you will lose
weight. There are two variables in that equation. Either you exercise more,
eat less, or both. I'm trying desperately to do both. I used to be really
good at eating less, but recently, I've been better at exercising. I've
never managed to be good at both simultaneously.
</p><p>
The easiest way I've found to succeed with eating less is simply to
track what I eat. There's something about consciously recognizing what
you eat that helps moderate it. Even if you don't plan to decrease the
amount of food you eat, if you record everything, you probably
will find yourself eating less. The best tool I've found for recording
what I eat is MyFitnessPal. It's a free on-line tool that allows you
to add food from its extensive database and have the calories
calculated automatically. It even allows you to scan the barcode
on packages and import the nutrition information automatically. The social
aspect of MyFitnessPal is also helpful, because having accountability
partners can make a world of difference. If you'd like to try it with
me, and possibly with other <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers, feel free to connect to me:
<a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/shawnp0wers" target="_self">www.myfitnesspal.com/shawnp0wers</a>.
</p><p>
When it comes to exercise, there are obviously many ways to burn
calories. Some exercises burn more than others, but for me, the best
fat-burning activity is walking. Sure, there are other exercises that
burn more calories per minute, but I find it difficult to swim or jog
very far before tiring out. Walking, however, is an exercise I can do for
hours. It burns far more calories to walk for an hour than it does to run
for five minutes. And personally, I think it's easier to do the hour of walking.
</p><p>
I try to walk a minimum of 10,000 steps per day. It's easiest to have
a pedometer to keep track of your steps during the day. My favorite
pedometer is one of the models from <a href="http://www.fitbit.com" target="_self">www.fitbit.com</a>. I love the geeky
Bluetooth syncing, graphing on so on. Plus, like with MyFitnessPal, there's
a social aspect to the FitBit. You can join forces (or compete against)
your friends on-line. Sometimes a quick look at the leaderboard will be
enough motivation to get out and walk for a while. In fact, ever since
we started wearing FitBit trackers, my wife and I have started parking
at the far side of the parking lot when we go shopping. That way, we
get a few more steps in while we're getting to the store!
</p><p>
If you'd like to connect with me on FitBit, head over to the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
group page and join (<a href="https://www.fitbit.com/group/22M75H" target="_self">https://www.fitbit.com/group/22M75H</a>). The service is
free, but the FitBit devices are unfortunately on the pricey side. Still,
I think it's possible to join even without a FitBit device. If we get
enough people to join, it could turn into quite a group!

Step 2: Keeping Old Age Away!</h2></div></div><p>
Walking and weight loss have developed into something that I never in a
million years expected. I still have weight to lose, but I've lost enough
that I have a little more stamina. After reading a book by Matthew Inman
on running, I decided to give it a try. Even if you have no intention
of ever running, I highly recommend his book. Most of it is available
on-line at his Web site: <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running" target="_self">theoatmeal.com/comics/running</a>.
</p><p>
Running is a surprisingly controversial activity. Some people say it is
hard on joints. Some people say it is good for joints and strengthens
them. Many think running helps keep you young, while many others claim
running ages you faster. Some people claim it will cause arthritis,
while other say it's a great way to build bone density and prevent
osteoporosis. The one thing everyone agrees on, however, is that running
is a very effective way to get a cardio workout. I never was able to run
as a kid, and now that I've been diagnosed with asthma and can treat
it, running is possible for the first time in my life.
</p><p>
I'm not a good runner. I'm slow. I can't go very far at once. I
concentrate so hard on breathing that I end up spitting and
drooling. I
jiggle&mdash;a lot. Still, I'm slowly getting better at it. After a month
or so of working on it, I'm actually starting to enjoy it. It's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span>
hard work, but it's the sort of hard work that is rewarding in and of
itself. If you've never run before, or if you're even remotely interested in
starting, here are a few of my tips. Keep in mind I'm still a beginner,
but the following tips got me through the miserable beginning stages.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
If you have health issues, talk to your doctor. Without treating
my asthma, I'd never be able to run. Even if you are being treated
for asthma, it's good to see your doctor anyway. Oh and if you're
a fellow asthmatic who uses an inhaler? I beg you to read this:
<a href="http://snar.co/asthma" target="_self">snar.co/asthma</a>.
</p></li><li><p>
Buy good shoes. I used to think people who spent lots of money on shoes
were crazy. (I still think that's the case with high heels.) When it comes
to running, however, high-quality shoes that have been fitted for your
running style are vital. It will help you avoid injury and make the
experience far less miserable. Spending upward of $100 on running shoes
isn't uncommon. The most important part, however, is to go to a shoe store
that specializes in running shoes so you can be properly fitted. Don't go
to a general sporting goods store&mdash;they won't know what they're doing.
</p></li><li><p>
Start with a program like Couch-2-5K (C25K). There are several Android
apps that give you a training schedule and even help you time your
sessions to build up to the full 5K. The best part about using one of
the C25K programs is that you're forced to build slowly. Doing too much
too fast will lead to misery and injury.
</p></li><li><p>
Make a commitment to keep it up until you can run 30 minutes
straight. That won't seem possible at first&mdash;really. Running one minute
at the beginning was almost impossible for me. After several months,
however, I finally got to the point where I could run (very slowly) for a full
30 minutes. As if it were some magical rite of passage, when I reached
the 30-minute mark, I didn't hate running anymore. Mind you, it's still
very hard, it hurts, and it's not exactly &ldquo;fun&rdquo;, but once you reach
that 30 minute mark (which incidentally is about how long it takes to
run a 5K), something changes.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Right now I'm to the point where I want to increase my distance and
increase my speed. I can run for 30 minutes, but just barely. There
is a lot of advice out there for brand-new runners, but oddly, not so
much once you reach that magical 5K/30-minute mark. Because I want to keep
getting better, I recently thought it would be a good challenge to run
at 6mph instead of my regular 5mph. As it's a measly 1mph difference,
I didn't think it would be all that bad.
</p><p>
I. Was. Wrong.
</p><p>
I learned through the school of hard knocks that increasing your speed
20% overnight is really dumb. I went from being able to run three miles to
almost collapsing after one. It was frustrating. It hurt. I got discouraged
and honestly considered quitting the whole running thing. Thankfully,
just like with dieting and walking, there are some incredible social
tools for runners. And if there's one thing runners are good at, it's
encouraging other runners&mdash;especially new runners. I suspect it's because
they remember being a beginner, and know just how horrible and difficult
it is at first.
</p><p>
By the time this issue goes out, I hope to be one of those crazy running
guys who goes out and runs 5&ndash;6 miles on a regular basis. It's still hard
for me to imagine that being the case, but I really hope it happens. If
you want to start running and could use some encouragement, I urge
you to check out a site like <a href="http://dailymile.com" target="_self">dailymile.com</a>. It's a great way to
record your runs, but more important, it's a community of runners. Have
I mentioned how encouraging runners can be to other runners, especially
beginners? Look me up on the Dailymile Web site&mdash;maybe we can encourage
each other (<a href="http://www.dailymile.com/people/shawnp0wers" target="_self">www.dailymile.com/people/shawnp0wers</a>).

Life Hacking</h2></div></div><p>
This article was largely focused on my day-to-day life in geek
world. Normally I'd say drop me an e-mail with your particular twist
on living the geek life, but my e-mail box has been largely untamable
lately. You still can e-mail me if you like, but please don't hesitate
to reach out via Twitter, Facebook or Google+. I have lots of ideas
for future lifestyle columns, like:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Souped up battery backup units.
</p></li><li><p>
Home automation.
</p></li><li><p>
Photo consolidation and management.
</p></li><li><p>
Home networking.
</p></li><li><p>
Car-mounted technology.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
But, I'd love to hear ideas and requests from you. I had a lot of fun
talking about the geek life here, and I can't wait to hear from all
of you on-line!
