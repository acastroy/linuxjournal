This article concludes the series on 6LoWPAN by looking at the
application layer: device description using CoRE Link Format, data
formats using CBOR and REST APIs. Although these are only one set of
choices, they are emerging as the principal choices for low power
devices. I use Python to illustrate these, but many other languages
are possible.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x26681f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my previous two articles (see the November and December 2016 issues of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>), I described setting up a 6LoWPAN network and then
integrating that into the internet so that the low power sensor/actuator nodes can talk to
internet hosts and vice versa. This is one of the major mechanisms currently proposed
for bringing the Internet of Things (IoT) to life.
</p><p>
Once you have established a communications pathway, however, you need to look at how you are going
to use that pathway to exchange information&mdash;specifically, the protocols and the data types. The currently
favored protocols are MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) and CoAP (Constrained Application
Protocol), and they each fill different roles. MQTT is a messaging system using publish/subscribe, which has been adapted for
low power devices. CoAP is similar to, and based
on, HTTP but is heavily optimized for low power devices.
This article focuses on CoAP.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x2668460"></a>
CoAP</h2></div></div><p>
The World Wide Web is built on the HTTP protocol. This is a traditional client/server
model, where clients connect to a server over TCP and make requests of the server, which
in turn prepares replies and delivers them to the client. The outstanding success of
the Web has led to this being used as the model for CoAP, with the following
appropriate changes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
HTTP is TCP-based. A TCP session requires a handshake setup, acknowledgment of packets,
retries on failure and keepalive mechanisms. UDP is much lighter; packets are sent via
a &ldquo;send and forget&rdquo; mechanism. CoAP uses UDP, and it is up to the sender
as to whether it requires an acknowledgement.
</p></li><li><p>
Because HTTP is a transport protocol, any application-layer protocol can be built on top
of it. One of the worst of these was SOAP, a protocol that has had some success in
enterprise systems. CoAP uses REST, which is much closer aligned with HTTP.
</p></li><li><p>
Application data traditionally has been attached to HTTP packets using formats like
XML and, more recently, JSON. These are text-based, and consequently, they are heavy both in
payload and in processing. CoAP applications can use any of these, but the trend is
toward CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation), a binary version of JSON.
</p></li><li><p>
HTTP does not allow messages to be sent from the server to clients, so CoAP has added a
mechanism for this. This is coming into HTTP through &ldquo;server push&rdquo; mechanisms.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x2668930"></a>
REST</h2></div></div><p>
REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is the philosophy behind HTTP, described by Roy
Fielding (the principal HTTP 1.1 architect) in his PhD thesis. In a horribly
emasculated form, he says that
1) resources are identified by URIs, such as Web URLs, and 2)
resources are accessed using only four verbs: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE, with defined
meanings (although when to use PUT and when to use POST is still debated). These
definitions are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
GET: get a representation of a resource. For sensor data, this most likely will be in
JSON or CBOR format, and will contain data, such as the temperature of a sensor.
</p></li><li><p>
PUT: set a new value for a resource. For a heating system, it could be setting a new
temperature value.
</p></li><li><p>
POST: usually used to create a new resource, and possibly of limited use for sensors and
actuators.
</p></li><li><p>
DELETE: delete a resource. Again, it's possibly of limited value here.
I provide a more expansive version at
<a href="https://jan.newmarch.name/IoT/Middleware/REST" target="_self">https://jan.newmarch.name/IoT/Middleware/REST</a>.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x2668da8"></a>
CoAP and Python</h2></div></div><p>
CoAP will most likely be run as a server on sensors and actuators. These won't be
highly endowed with RAM, and they are actually unlikely to be able to run Python,
which 
takes megabytes of RAM. Even micro-Python takes about 180kB of RAM. Most likely, they
will run compiled code, using a library such as the libcoap C library 
(<a href="https://libcoap.net" target="_self">https://libcoap.net</a>). 
</p><p>
I'm running these examples on Raspberry Pis, so I'm using Python for simplicity. There are
many Python packages for CoAP and many implementations of CoAP for other languages
(see <a href="http://coap.technology/impls.html" target="_self">coap.technology/impls.html</a>). The Ubuntu x86 repositories have the aiocoap
Python package, so you can install that on your desktop with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install python3-aiocoap
</pre>
</p><p>
The RPi repositories currently have no CoAP packages, so you will have to install
something (again!). You need to get the CoAP package on the sensor RPi. Download it
from aiocoap, the Python CoAP library (<a href="https://github.com/chrysn/aiocoap" target="_self">https://github.com/chrysn/aiocoap</a>). It contains the Python libraries in the
aiocoap directory as Python code. You can move that directory to, say,
/usr/lib/python3.4, so that it can be found from any Python 3 program:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/chrysn/aiocoap.git
cd aiocoap/
sudo mv aiocoap /usr/lib/python3.4
</pre>
</p><p>
The package also contains clientGET.py, clientPUT.py and server.py. These not only
demonstrate the CoAP package, but they also test some features. (I'll adapt these to our
purpose here.)
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x2669170"></a>
A Simple CoAP Application</h2></div></div><p>
I'm going to use the CPU temperature example from my previous two articles, as it is about as simple
as one can get.
</p><p>
The sensor has to be exposed as a resource&mdash;that is, have a URI (here a URL). This
will use the scheme <tt  >coap://</tt> or <tt  >coaps://</tt>, its IPv6 address and its URI path, such as
<tt  >temperature</tt>. Note that the sensor will be running as a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span>&mdash;the <span   class="emphasis"><em>client</em></span> will be
making queries to the server.
</p><p>
To the client, the URL will look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
coap://[fd28::2]/temperature
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x2669538"></a></h2></div></div><p>
using the global IPv6 address you set on the &ldquo;sensor&rdquo; RPi in the previous article. The
IPv6 address needs to be in square brackets ([...]) to avoid the colons (:) being confused with a URL
Port option. The default UDP port is 5683.
</p><p>
The aiocoap package uses the recently added <tt  >yield
from</tt> Python generator system. I
won't go into that here (it is non-trivial). The major parts to note are what you configure
in the client and server.
</p><p>
The client needs to set the method as <tt  >GET</tt> to fetch the CPU temperature of the server,
using the server's URI. Then it reads a response and does something to it. Here you
just print the response. The client is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import asyncio

from aiocoap import *

@asyncio.coroutine
def main():
    protocol = yield from Context.create_client_context()

    request = Message(code=GET)
    request.set_request_uri('coap://[fd28::2]/temperature')

    try:
        response = yield from protocol.request(request).response
    except Exception as e:
        print('Failed to fetch resource:')
        print(e)
    else:
        print('Result: %s\n%r'%(response.code,
                                response.payload.decode('utf-8')))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
</pre>
</p><p>
The server uses the asynchronous I/O package asyncio. Again, you can ignore the details
of this. The important thing is to add <span   class="emphasis"><em>resources</em></span> that can be accessed by CoAP user
agents (clients). You add a new resource with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root.add_resource(('temperature',), TemperatureResource())
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x26699b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which sets the URI-Path (/temperature) of the resource on this host and a class
(<tt  >TemperatureResource</tt>) to be invoked when the resource is
requested. Any number of
resources can be added, such as pressure, motion and so on, each with their own class
handler.
</p><p>
The handling class is the most complex, and there are many possibilities. The simplest
will subclass from <tt  >aiocoap.resource.Resource</tt> and will have a
method <tt  >render_get</tt>, which
is called when a <tt  >GET</tt> for a representation of the resource is
needed. For the example sensor,
this gets the CPU temperature as before and then wraps it into an
<tt  >aiocoap.Message</tt>.
Here's the server code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import asyncio
import aiocoap.resource as resource
import aiocoap

from subprocess import PIPE, Popen

class TemperatureResource(resource.Resource):
    def __init__(self):
        super(TemperatureResource, self).__init__()

    @asyncio.coroutine
    def render_get(self, request):
        process = Popen(['vcgencmd', 'measure_temp'], stdout=PIPE)
        output, _error = process.communicate()
        return aiocoap.Message(code=aiocoap.CONTENT, payload=output)

def main():
    # Resource tree creation
    root = resource.Site()
    
    root.add_resource(('temperature',), TemperatureResource())
 
    asyncio.async(aiocoap.Context.create_server_context(root))

    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</pre>
</p><p>
The output from running the client against this server is similar to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Result: 2.05 Content
"temp=36.9'C\n"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x2a62078"></a></h2></div></div><p>
as in previous examples.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x2a62180"></a>
Making Things Reusable</h2></div></div><p>
What I've basically done at this point is hack up an example to show how CoAP
works, but the IoT isn't going to succeed if programmers act like that. My sensor
will need to work in your environment, talking to other people's systems. The IoT
isn't going to be a simple monolithic environment. It's going to be a mess of multiple
systems trying to talk to each other.
</p><p>
Standards and conventions will need to be agreed upon, and not just between people, but
in ways that can be read and confirmed by machines. I've used CoAP over 6LoWPAN, and
that is just one battle that is raging. The next one is over data formats and device
descriptions&mdash;both using them and discovering them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x2a62338"></a>
Data Formats</h2></div></div><p>
HTTP has mechanisms to query and to specify data formats. For HTTP, this is managed by
Content Negotiation, and this idea is carried across into CoAP: a client can request
particular data formats, while the server may have preferred and default formats.
</p><p>
XML is generally regarded as too heavyweight. JSON is better, but as a text format, it
still carries baggage. CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) is an IETF RFC for
a binary encoding of JSON and is becoming popular. It has an advantage of being
self-contained, unlike other recent binary formats, such as Google's Protocol Buffers,
which require an external specification of the data.
</p><p>
A JSON format of the sensor data could look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
{
  "temperature" : 37.9,
  "units" : 'C'
}
</pre>
</p><p>
CBOR translates this into a binary format, which may be more concise.
</p><p>
To use CBOR, first you need to install it. Python packages normally are installed
using <tt  >pip</tt>, and
the RPi does not come with this installed. So install both it and the
<tt  >cbor</tt> module
(note that you want the Python 3 versions):

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install cbor
sudo pip3 install LinkHeader
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, a JSON equivalent data type can be encoded using
<tt  >cbor.dumps</tt>, which creates a byte
array and is decoded by <tt  >cbor.loads</tt>, which turns it back into a Python type. A Python
dictionary is equivalent to the JSON of a JavaScript class object given above.
</p><p>
The server is modified by code to create a Python dictionary and then turn it into
CBOR. The client is likewise modified to decode the CBOR data into a Python
dictionary. You also will do some elementary content specification, using IANA-registered
numbers. The <tt  >application/cbor</tt> number is 60, from the IETF RFC 7049.
</p><p>
The relevant part of the server is this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CONTENT_FORMAT_CBOR = 60

class TemperatureResource(resource.Resource):
    def __init__(self):
        super(TemperatureResource, self).__init__()

    @asyncio.coroutine
    def render_get(self, request):
        process = Popen(['vcgencmd', 'measure_temp'], stdout=PIPE)
        output, _error = process.communicate()
        list = re.split("[='\n]", output.decode('utf-8'))
        dict = {'temperature' : float(list[1]), 'unit' : list[2]}
        mesg = aiocoap.Message(code=aiocoap.CONTENT,
                               payload=cbor.dumps(dict))
        mesg.opt.content_format = CONTENT_FORMAT_CBOR
        return mesg
</pre>
</p><p>
And, here's the
relevant part of the client: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
request = Message(code=GET)
request.set_request_uri('coap://[fd28::2]/temperature')

try:
    response = yield from protocol.request(request).response
except Exception as e:
    print('Failed to fetch resource:')
    print(e)
else:
    if response.opt.content_format == CONTENT_FORMAT_CBOR:
        print('Result: %s\n%r'%(response.code,
                                cbor.loads(response.payload)))
    else:
        print('Unknown format')
</pre>
</p><p>
This prints something like this:
	
<pre     class="programlisting">
Result: 2.05 Content
{'temperature': 37.4, 'unit': 'C'}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x2a62ac8"></a>
Device Descriptions</h2></div></div><p>
The code above is fine for interacting with a temperature sensor&mdash;once
you know what
that is! You may have hundreds of sensors of different types, and all you may know is
their IPv6 address. To complete this, you need to know the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
What is the specification of a device, such as a &ldquo;temperature
sensor&rdquo;?
</p></li><li><p>
What are the special values for your sensor (for example, max and min
temperatures)?
</p></li><li><p>
How do you tell what type of device you have?
</p></li><li><p>
How do you know how the CoAP requests interact with your device?
</p></li></ul></div><p>
At the moment, there are no industry-agreed-upon answers to those questions. One could say that
(unfortunately) this is another of the differentiators in the IoT world. The IETF in
RFC 7252 and RFC 6690 has made some progress, but there are still open
issues, and they are
not uniformly adopted.
</p><p>
From RFC 6690, each device should have a URI-path of /.well-known/core, which can be
accessed by an HTTP <tt  >GET coap://&lt;IPv6-addr&gt;/.well-known/core</tt> request. RFC 6690 specifies
that the representation must be in CoRE Link Format, which I will describe soon.
</p><p>
Two new link attributes are added to the standard Web link headers of RFC
5988, such as
<tt  >title</tt>. The new attributes are the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >rt</tt> for resource type.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >if</tt> for interface type.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The values of these attributes can be strings, URLs or anything&mdash;this isn't specified.
The resource type is expected to be some &ldquo;well known&rdquo; value that identifies the type
of device, such as <tt  >jan.newmarch:temperature-sensor</tt>.
Yes, I just made that up&mdash;there
are several proposals but no standards yet.
</p><p>
The value of <tt  >if</tt> is supposed to be some specification of the REST interface for the
device&mdash;that is, how to call it using <tt  >GET</tt>,
<tt  >PUT</tt> and so on, and what is returned from those
calls. How an interface is described isn't specified by RFC 6690. Although 
possibly using WADL (Web Application Description Language) is suggested, the Open Connectivity
Foundation uses RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language), and the Wikipedia page on
RESTful APIs lists a dozen more, probably used by some group or other.
</p><p>
Investigating REST API languages is beyond the scope of this article, so
let's just assume the
well known core resource has a value like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;/temperature&gt;;rt="jan.newmarch:temperature-sensor";
               if="https://jan.newmarch.name/temperature-sensor"

</pre>
</p><p>
Here /temperature is the relative URL of the resource, the value of
<tt  >rt</tt> is the &ldquo;well
known&rdquo; device type, and the value of <tt  >if</tt> is
the description of the device. Assume that
https://jan.newmarch.name/temperature-sensor contains WADL or RAML or some other
description that allows you to deduce that requesting the resource
<tt  >/temperature</tt> using
<tt  >GET</tt> will return a CBOR object with fields <tt  >temperature</tt> and
<tt  >unit</tt>, with float and string
values, respectively.
</p><p>
The format of the well-known resource is defined to be
in <tt  >application/link-format</tt>, which
according to the IANA CoAP Content-Formats site
(<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/core-parameters/core-parameters.xhtml#content-formats" target="_self">https://www.iana.org/assignments/core-parameters/core-parameters.xhtml#content-formats</a>) has CoAP code 40. The format is actually just
UTF-8.
</p><p>
The server is modified by adding another resource:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root.add_resource(('.well-known', 'core'), WKCResource(root))
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2570580.0x2a63af0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where <tt  >WKCResource</tt> is a class in the
<tt  >aiocoap</tt> module, which keeps a list of all the
resources supplied by this device.
</p><p>
When the client <tt  >GET</tt>s the resource
<tt  >/.well-known/core</tt>, it will get a comma-separated list
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;/.well-known/core&gt;; ct=40,
&lt;/temperature&gt;;
    if="https://jan.newmarch/temperature-sensor";
    rt="jan.newmarch.name:temperature-sensor"

</pre>
</p><p>
For each resource, a client should extract the <tt  >rt</tt>
value. If it recognizes it as a
temperature device, then it should carry on. If it doesn't, it should look
up the <tt  >if</tt> URL and extract what
the <tt  >GET</tt> method can do, and then carry on. That code is not covered here. The CoRE Link
Format string can be parsed using the Python LinkHeader package.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This series has addressed the issues of setting up a 6LoWPAN low power wireless
network, using the OpenLabs radios on Raspberry Pis, followed by bringing these
devices into internet visibility. This concluding article looks at data formats and
protocols for the IoT.
</p><p>
Many topics have been omitted. The major one is that of security, as the system
I have described here is wide open to snooping and hacking. The security mechanisms are
all there, but they are a full topic in their own right.
</p><p>
I also have ignored the issue of how external clients find the IP addresses of the
clients. This is answered by internet draft &ldquo;CoRE Resource Directory
draft-ietf-core-resource-directory&rdquo; (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-resource-directory-09" target="_self">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-resource-directory-09</a>).
</p><p>
I haven't addressed networking within a 6LoWPAN network. There are a variety of
models, such as mesh networking, and they build on the IEEE802.15.4
networking model.
</p><p>
Finally, I haven't mentioned other pieces of hardware dealing with IEEE802.15.4 and
6LoWPAN. These include modules from Texas Instruments, Firefly and Libelium, with many
others coming along.
