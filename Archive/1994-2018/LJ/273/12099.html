Password managers make
it easy to have unique user names, unique email addresses and unique
passwords for each account. They also provide a secure store for extra
account details. Additional features like notes and attachments allow
you to use password managers as secure escrow files like digital safety
deposit boxes.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x1fdc250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Internet and cloud companies do not have perfect security. You're all
familiar with large-scale data theft from big corporations. Although most
enterprises do a great job considering the attacks against them, you can do your
part by protecting your own accounts.
</p><p>
It's common wisdom to use a different password for each account. Better
yet is using a unique email address as well. Doing so quickly becomes
unwieldy, however, so you find you need an external brain.
</p><p>
Password managers function well as this external brain and can help with
more than just passwords. They make it easy to have unique entries for
user names, email addresses, security-question answers and much more.
</p><p>
Password managers securely encrypt data before storing it. In addition
to passwords, they should have fields for record name, user name, website
and notes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12099f1.large.jpg"><img src="12099f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Password managers should have fields for record name, user name,
website and notes. 
</p></div></div><p>
The following example uses the <tt  >apg</tt> (Automated Password Generator)
command to create a random string of text:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ apg -n1 -Mnl
vucapob7
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you have a unique user name for your bank. The next social-media site
thieves will have to figure out both your user name and your password to
attack your bank account.
</p><p>
Use a unique email address. Rather than creating a whole new email
account, you can likely take advantage of sub-addressing.
</p><p>
Some email providers have sub-addressing, which allows a separator
character and then a token. When delivered, the email provider
ignores the separator character and the text after it. For example,
you+vucapob7-mybank@example.com would be delivered to you@example.com. See
the Email Sub-addressing sidebar for more information.
</p><p>
Unique email addresses make it harder for thieves to social-engineer
companies, as they won't have your user name, whether or not it's
an email address.
</p><p>
Since you're storing credentials in a password manager, you don't need to
memorize or even see them. In fact, now you've turned your password manager into
a credential manager holding unique passwords, unique user names and unique
email addresses. Just a few paragraphs in, and you're already powering up!
</p><p>
But, as the infomercials say, there's more.
</p><p>
The notes field allows you to store multi-factor emergency codes, shoe
size and anything else that might be useful for the account. You could
store customer-service phone numbers, cheat codes for getting to an
actual person and notes from the last call.
</p><p>
Some sites have undocumented password requirements, such as not allowing
% in a password. The notes field is a good place for a reminder for
you. If you use NoScript and a cookie blocker, you also might want
to add notes about required JavaScript and cookie domains to use the site.
</p><p>
One key to having unique security questions is to
lie. The company doesn't
need to know your grandma's favorite first high school mascot. It just
needs a response only you can give. Random text to the rescue:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ apg -n1 -m15 -Mnl
icunyedgicekoco
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a fun one, but it'll be challenging if you have to say it over the
phone. <tt  >apg</tt> can help with that. The
<tt  >-t</tt> option says to give pronunciation
guides:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ apg -n1 -m15 -Mnl -t
icunyedgicekoco (ic-un-yed-gic-ek-oc-o)
</pre>
</p><p>
It still sounds like a foreign language, but it's hardly guessable. The credential
manager doesn't care&mdash;it's just data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x1fdcda8"></a>
KeePassX Credential Manager</h2></div></div><p>
I recommend using KeePassX combined with KeePassDroid.
This article uses KeePassX 2.x. Most of it applies also to the KeePassX
1.x versions, but there are some differences.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12099f2.large.jpg"><img src="12099f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. KeePassX Opening Screen
</p></div></div><p>
Select Database&rarr;New Database to create a new credential database.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12099f3.large.jpg"><img src="12099f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Creating a New Database
</p></div></div><p>
This password you have to memorize. If you forget the password for
your KeePass file, you can't open it. See the Creating Good
Passwords sidebar for how to choose wisely.
</p><p>
You also can use a key file. The key file holds the key used to unlock
the database, and your password opens the key file. An advantage is that
the keyfile can be stored separately from the credential database.
</p><p>
Once you've entered your password, I recommend you save the file and
close it, then open the file again to make sure you can type in your
new password. Open and close it three or four times to help you memorize the
password. After 15 minutes, do the close and open dance again, then make
sure you test it the next morning as well. Forgetting that password is
the same as losing the file&mdash;the data is unavailable.
</p><p>
To add a new entry, either click the key icon with the green arrow or
the Entries&rarr;Add New Entry drop-down menu. The drop-down shows a third option,
the Ctrl-n shortcut.
</p><p>
KeePassX can autogenerate passwords. In addition to specifying character
groups like upper and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters,
you can choose length and exclude look-alike characters, such as O and
0 and 1 and l.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12099f4.large.jpg"><img src="12099f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Autogenerating a Password
</p></div></div><p>
Choose a long length like 42 characters since you're not memorizing
the passwords. The eye button will let you view the random text if you
need to (which is useful if a site discourages good passwords by blocking password
pasting). Click the accept button to get KeePassX to store the new entry,
then save the file.
</p><p>
In addition to the notes field, KeePassX 2.x has fields for additional
attributes. The latter is a better place for storing security questions
and answers. Although both fields display the values in plain text, the
default screen does not show additional attributes, and there's a drop-down menu to use them.
</p><p>
Additional attributes can be found in the Advanced section for an
entry. To copy them, use the Entries drop-down, select Copy Attribute
to Clipboard, then select the attribute you want.
</p><p>
For securely copying a secret, it's important to keep it hidden and keep it
safe. The password stays hidden because it isn't displayed. It's kept
safe because it expires out of the clipboard. By default, the clipboard
is cleared after ten seconds.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12099f5.large.jpg"><img src="12099f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Clear Clipboard Setting
</p></div></div><p>
KeePassX provides handy keyboard shortcuts. Ctrl-b copies the user name
into the clipboard for pasting, and Ctrl-c copies the password. Review
the drop-down menus to find more shortcuts.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x1fdd958"></a>
Credential Manager Features</h2></div></div><p>
You should require the following features in a credential manager:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Clipboard clearing.
</p></li><li><p>
Password generation.
</p></li><li><p>
Pronounceable password option.
</p></li><li><p>
Encrypted data with operating-system-independent storage.
</p></li><li><p>
Backups and data liberation.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The clipboard should be cleared automagically after a short time. There's no
need for it to stick around and get pasted somewhere accidentally.
</p><p>
A credential manager should have a password generator. Even better is
a random text generator available from anywhere in the application that
simplifies creating random values for security questions and responses,
sub-addressing tokens and birthdates.
</p><p>
The random text generator should have an option for pronounceable
passwords. KeePassX 1.x does, but KeePassX 2.x does not. Hopefully
the feature will be added back in. apg's pronunciation guide is quite
useful. Neither version of KeePassX has that.
</p><p>
The data file must be encrypted and interoperable. In order to be trusted,
the encryption software and algorithm need to be free and open so they
can be audited independently. KeePassX is GPLv2 or later, and KeePassDroid
is GPLv3. Both incorporate code under other free software licenses.
</p><p>
Interoperability means usable by multiple applications. KeePassX and
KeePassDroid use free and open KeePass file formats. KeePass, kpcli
and other applications also can use the files. None can open the file
without the master password. They are your passwords; you should have
exclusive access.
</p><p>
Being operating-system-independent is important for secure data. KeePassX runs
on GNU/Linux, BSD, Mac and Windows. KeePassDroid will put both user name
and password into the notification drawer for easy selection on the phone.
</p><p>
You need to have backups and data liberation. Since KeePass files are
encrypted, copying them elsewhere is sufficient for backups. Keep old
master passwords secure as they can be used on old backups of the file.
</p><p>
Data liberation means you can access your data even if the original
application or service provider stops working. A standard format like
KeePass works since many applications can read it. Additionally, KeePassX
exports to a plain-text file. Make sure to protect it with an encryption
tool, such as GnuPG.
</p><p>
For online password managers, data liberation means you can get your
data back out of the service provider in an open format. If you use a
proprietary service, you are dependent on that service allowing you
access. Make regular exports to an open format in case the provider goes
offline, decides you haven't paid recently or jumbles your data.
</p><p>
I recommend separate files for personal and work. No need for a
subpoena about some work contract to have access to all of your personal
credentials. Just like email, keep personal and work in separate accounts.
</p><p>
For traveling or mobile use, you don't need all of your credentials. You
can drop the whole file on some file-sharing service and unlock the
entire file from your phone, but then a compromise on your phone has
access to all of your accounts as well.
</p><p>
Keep an updated file with a subset on the mobile device. I recommend the
minimum essentials to connect to your file-sharing service and operate
if you have voice, but not data.
</p><p>
KeePassX does not provide a way to sync data to another location securely`,
but kpcli can export a group to a new KeePass 1.x file. For instance,
create a &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; group in your KeePass file, then use kpcli to export
that group. kpcli is available under the same licensing as Perl.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x23d65a0"></a>
Other Useful Features</h2></div></div><p>
A credential manager also can be used to escrow data like family
social security numbers, important private dates, insurance account
information and anything else your family might need should you no longer
be available. KeePassX also can store attachments. Now you have a data
escrow manager. Power up.
</p><p>
A credential manager should liberally allow text for the master
password. KeepPass files do. As expected, KeePass accepts special
characters. In fact, when I give presentations on KeePassX, I often demo
unlocking a KeePass file with cut and paste of Perl and shell script
snippets.
</p><p>
KeePassX has an Auto-Type feature that will log you in to
a website with one hot key: Ctrl-v. Although other people
like Auto-Type features, I find it too easy to mis-click and
paste my credentials in the wrong place. Eventually I do get
it right, usually long before &ldquo;user+twyimCij5-fsf@example.com
zFsZ5ZwEh5FHRgYf474MCRQ8pW4YNDXT87wrsQhkyL&rdquo; starts trending in Google
searches.
</p><p>
KeePass files also support an expiration date for passwords, and KeePassX
provides preset time periods like three and six months. Once the entry
expires,
KeePassX marks it when viewing the group as a reminder to change the
password.
</p><p>
KeePass allows you to access previous versions of an entry via its
history feature. It's not quite revision control, but it's still handy.
</p><p>
It's also handy to provide a means of live security and authenticity
testing.
</p><p>
For instance, LastPass is an online commercial password manager with
a history of quickly responding to needs. For example, shortly after
Heartbleed was announced, LastPass integrated a check to verify the
destination website did not have the Heartbleed bug before sending
credentials. It also does some verification to make sure you're connecting
to the actual site rather than some phishing site.
</p><p>
LastPass is mostly browser-based. The company also provides a command-line
tool with source available, and a perusal of several files yielded
GPLv2 or later licensing.
</p><p>
LastPass does encryption and password creation on the client side, so the
company never has access to your unencrypted data. It shares credentials
by encrypting on the client side with the recipient's public key. Again,
LastPass doesn't see unencrypted credentials.
</p><p>
LastPass also advertises a feature that allows the other person to use
the credentials without seeing them. Although LastPass can't view the
unencrypted data, it's fairly easy for the recipient to capture the
hidden plain-text password.
</p><p>
See the Password Managers sidebar for a list of free software
password managers.
</p><p>
If you prefer password generation and password storage to come from different
applications, the Generating Random Text sidebar has some
ideas for creating your own random strings.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x23d6b20"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Creating Good Passwords</b></p><p>
When using a credential manager, you need to memorize only a few
passwords&mdash;for instance, your password to authenticate to your computer
and credential manager, and both for work as well.
</p><p>
Here are some tips on building strong, but memorizable passwords:
</p><p>
1) Use multiple unrelated words, at least four.
</p><p>
2) Include numbers, capital letters (not just at the beginning of a word)
and punctuation. Perhaps use them rather than spaces.
</p><p>
3) If fluent in multiple languages, use them.
</p><p>
4) Use nonsensical, uncommon words&mdash;no common phrases.
For instance, start with four unrelated words. This is probably fine
for computer and network logins that change every few months:

<pre     class="programlisting">
anteater twiddle aquamarine drove
</pre>
</p><p>
5) Use more than four words for your password manager where backups might
be captured for long-term, offline attacks:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ameisenbaer twiddle aguamarina drove preamble esac
</pre>
</p><p>
6) Even better, add some non-space transitions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
aMeisenbaer%tWiddle aGuamarina9dRovezpReamblezeSac
</pre>
</p><p>
On a mobile device, that last example is a pain. Especially when using a
simpler password, minimize the number of entries in the mobile password
database, and change anything in it on a regular basis in case some app
ships the file off to a botnet for cracking or the phone is stolen.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x23d70f8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Generating Random Text</b></p><p>
The biggest key to a strong password is entropy, randomness. Use long,
pure random text to get high entropy. A credential manager isn't the
only way to create long strings of random text. For instance, let your
cat walk on your keyboard.
</p><p>
Here are some methods that are more efficient and less scratchy than
trying to train your cat to work on demand:
</p><p>
1) Use a random text generation tool, such as apg, pwgen or makepasswd.
</p><p>
2) Use GnuPG's random function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg --gen-random --armor 1 42
</pre>
</p><p>
3) Use OpenSSL's random function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ openssl rand -base64 42
</pre>
</p><p>
4) Use <tt  >uuidcdef</tt> to create a UUID:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ uuidcdef -u
</pre>
</p><p>
5) Create a hash of a real answer plus a master password as the salt:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "anteater twiddle aquamarine drove \
LinuxJournal.com" | sha256sum | cut -c 42
</pre>
</p><p>
A feature of this method is that one master password can derive any site
password without saving anything to disk. There's even a tool to help
with that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ passwordmaker -r LinuxJournal.com -g 42 -a SHA1 \
-x -m "anteater twiddle aquamarine drove"
</pre>
</p><p>
One problem with derive-on-the-fly is that you don't have per-site random
text. <tt  >passwordmaker</tt> does allow using an unencrypted configuration file.
</p><p>
6) Use <tt  >date</tt> to generate a random birthdate:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date -d @$(($RANDOM*24*3600/2-500000000)) +%Y%b%d
</pre>
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x23d7938"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Email Sub-addressing</b></p><p>
Sub-addressing augments your email address by inserting tokens. It turns
one email address into as many as you want.
</p><p>
A separator character is placed after the user name
portion of an email address, and then you can add a token,
&lt;username&gt;&lt;character&gt;&lt;token&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;. You decide on the token.
</p><p>
Tokens can protect your accounts as listed in the article and also
filter email. For instance, phishers like to send fake eBay mail. It's
not eBay's fault, but it's a popular target. With an eBay token, you
know that email without the token, user+pl8qr-ebay@example.com for instance,
isn't from eBay and can be trashed automagically.
</p><p>
Some common email providers and their separator characters are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Gmail: +
</p></li><li><p>
FastMail.FM: +
</p></li><li><p>
Kolab: +
</p></li><li><p>
Yahoo!: -
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Gmail sub-addressing can be disabled at the domain level, so it might not
be available for work accounts.
</p><p>
FastMail.FM also offers sub-domain as an alternative to sub-addressing.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ee4580.0x23d8018"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Email Sub-addressing on Your Own SMTP Server</b></p><p>
Some common SMTP servers and their default separator characters are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Postfix: +
</p></li><li><p>
Exim: default off
</p></li><li><p>
Courier and qmail: -
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Some considerations if adding sub-addressing to a domain: many websites
disallow a plus sign in an email address; periods are allowed everywhere,
but often they already are in use for first.last@domain; dash is also fairly
universally allowed.
