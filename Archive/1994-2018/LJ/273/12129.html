There have been epic battles over whether &ldquo;insecure&rdquo; or
&ldquo;unsecure&rdquo; should
be used when referring to computer security. Granted, those epic battles
usually take place in really nerdy forums, but still, one sounds funny and
the other seems to personify computers. Whichever grammatical construct you
choose, the need for security is greater now than ever. As Linux users, we
need to make sure we're not overconfident in the inherent security of our
systems. Remember, they all have a weak link: us.

Reuven M. Lerner starts off this issue by showing how to test the machine learning model
he created last month. If computers are only as good as their programming,
it's important to test how well the code learns. Sometimes coming up with a
good test is harder than writing the original code!

Dave Taylor finishes his werewolf-warning system&mdash;er, I mean his phases of
the moon script this month. When you start writing scripts with Dave, you
start to realize all the cool additions you can make. Programming is like
that. Dave shows how to figure out whether the moon is waxing or waning,
which is really useful information when you're planning a family camping
trip in werewolf territory.

Kyle Rankin continues his series on MCollective, which is server
orchestration for configuration management systems. If Puppet and Chef
can't quite handle the day-to-day needs of your environment, using
MCollective might fill that need. 
</p><p>
I explore Synology this month, which
continues to fill my own needs for my home office. I've had multiple NAS
machines through the years, and nothing has been as useful, reliable and
performant as Synology. If you're looking for a storage device that also
handles a plethora of server functions, you'll want to check out my column
this issue.

der.hans 
has an incredible in-depth article this month on
using password managers. We rely so much on our online accounts, it's vital
that our passwords be strong and unique on each site. A password manager
is quickly becoming the only feasible way to accomplish that. der.hans
discusses how to manage passwords and retrieve them when needed. If
password managers aren't convenient, it's unlikely anyone will use them, so
learning the nuances of such an important technology is worth the effort.

Jan Newmarch finishes his series on low power wireless this month. The use
of a low-powered wireless network is a constant reminder of how much our
world is becoming connected. We're not far from a time when a hacker could
infiltrate our toaster to ruin breakfast. Thankfully, Jan's series helps us
to create our low powered wireless networks intelligently. Everyone should
read his series, even if you never plan to implement something like
6LoWPAN.

We love bringing you the latest information from the Linux world, whether
it's new products, fun apps or even in-depth security articles. Linux 
always has been at the forefront of computer security, and it's only going to
stay there if we take security seriously and don't assume we're safe just
because we use open source. If you're hoping to become a better, smarter
Linux user, this issue is for you.
