I don't know about you, but I'm still thinking extra-planetary
thoughts as we go through the tail end of this particularly contentious
election season and its aftermath. Maybe life on other planets is easier?
Ah, maybe not.
</p><p>
In any case, I completed the Martian lander and now am enmeshed in a phase
of the moon script. In my last article, I talked about the complications of
calculating the phase of the moon and decided simply to scrape the same website that Google uses: <a href="http://www.moongiant.com" target="_self">www.moongiant.com</a>.
</p><p>
That site provides the current moon illumination level, which lets you break it
down into the phases of new moon, crescent, quarter, gibbous and full.
Amateur astronomers know that the fun part of tracking the moon's
phase is to understand whether it's &ldquo;waxing&rdquo; (growing more
illuminated) or &ldquo;waning&rdquo; (growing less illuminated).
</p><p>
Although at any given moment the moon is illuminated based on its location,
and your location, relative to the sun, the full cycle of a moon phase
starts and ends with a new (0% illuminated) moon, and the full moon (100%
illuminated) is the mid-point of the journey.
</p><p>
Therefore, to ascertain waxing or waning, all you need to do is know the
moon's illumination level today and either yesterday or tomorrow.
Fortunately, the Moon Giant website obligingly has the ability for you to ascertain
the illumination level for a specific date.
</p><p>
A quick visit to the site with a regular web browser reveals that it works
using a date-based URL format like this:
http://www.moongiant.com/phase/11/6/2016.
</p><p>
So, you can build the date URL for the day before today with a call to
the <tt  >date</tt> program. If you've got the GNU version of
<tt  >date</tt>, it's easy
to back up a day:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date
Mon Nov  7 11:40:31 MST 2016
$ date -v -1d
Sun Nov  6 11:40:15 MST 2016
</pre>
</p><p>
It turns out that you also can specify that you want to back up 24 hours,
although, of
course, the net result is the same:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date -v -24H
Sun Nov  6 11:40:24 MST 2016
</pre>
</p><p>
More important, you can pass <tt  >date</tt> a format string that you then
can evaluate with the <tt  >eval</tt> function, so you can set month, day and year for
yesterday in one easy step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ eval $( date -v -1d +"mon=%m day=%d year=%Y" )
$ echo month = $mon, day = $day and year $year
month = 11, day = 06 and year 2016
</pre>
</p><p>
It's quite a handy trick when you need to work with extracting specific elements
from date and 10x that when it also involves date math.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232d580.0x2425c48"></a>
Older Date Programs Are More Complicated</h2></div></div><p>
But, what if your version of <tt  >date</tt> doesn't include the
<tt  >-v</tt> flag and
doesn't have all these fancy features? Then, my friend, you are facing
a definite challenge. Date math is pretty easy, except for the edge
cases.
</p><p>
That is, it's easy to extract the current month, day and year from even
the most rudimentary Linux version of <tt  >date</tt>, and it's obviously easy to
subtract one from the day, but what if it's the first of the month? Or
the first of the year?
</p><p>
That's doable too, but it's just a bit more work. Notably,
you'll also want to know about leap years, because one day prior to
March 1, 2016, might be February 28, or it might be February 29, depending on
whether 2016 was a leap year.
</p><p>
Now a sneaky way to do it simply would be to sidestep the issue. If the day
number of the month is greater than 1, subtract one to get yesterday's
date. If it is the first, however, <span   class="emphasis"><em>add one and reverse the logic of the
waxing/waning test</em></span>.
</p><p>
Fortunately, I do have the more sophisticated <tt  >date</tt>
program, so I'm going to do
that most frustrating of things and leave this particular facet as the
proverbial exercise for the reader.

Yesterday's Lunar Illumination Level</h2></div></div><p>
Knowing the format of the Moon Giant URL when you specify a date, and
knowing how to use <tt  >eval</tt> and
<tt  >date</tt> to get the numeric month, day and year
values for yesterday, here's some code to put that all together:

<pre     class="programlisting">
url_ago="http://www.moongiant.com/phase"
eval $( date -v -1d +"mon=%m day=%d year=%Y" )
ydayurl="$url_ago/$mon/$day/$year"
</pre>
</p><p>
The good news is that the resultant web page has the same format as the
page for today's illumination level too, so the same
<tt  >curl|grep</tt> sequence
explored in my last article can be reused for this task:

<pre     class="programlisting">
yillumlevel="$( curl -s "$ydayurl" | grep "$pattern" | tr ',' '\
' | grep "$pattern" | sed 's/[^0-9]//g')"
</pre>
</p><p>
In fact, let's add a debugging statement that displays both today's
lunar illumination level and yesterday's level:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo today\'s illumination level = $illumlevel and \
    yesterday was $yillumlevel
</pre>
</p><p>
Running it on November 7, 2016, here's what the script and
the Moon Giant website report:

<pre     class="programlisting">
today's illumination level = 47 and yesterday was 37
</pre>
</p><p>
Now it's a simple test: is today's level greater or less than
yesterday's level?
</p><p>
But wait, &ldquo;waxing&rdquo; and &ldquo;waning&rdquo; applies only to crescent
and gibbous moon phases. If the moon is new, quarter or full, neither word
applies in common astronomical parlance.
</p><p>
Seriously, who came up with these rules? Talk about complicated!
</p><p>
Here's how this all fits together:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $illumlevel -gt $yillumlevel ] ; then
  # we're waxing if it's getting brighter
  waxwane="waxing"
else
  waxwane="waning"
fi
if [ $illumlevel -lt 5 ] ; then
 phasename="new"
elif [ $illumlevel -lt 45 ] ; then
 phasename="$waxwane crescent"
elif [ $illumlevel -lt 55 ] ; then
 phasename="quarter"
elif [ $illumlevel -lt 95 ] ; then
 phasename="$waxwane gibbous"
else
 phasename="full"
fi
echo "The moon is currently $phasename with \
      $illumlevel% illuminated."
</pre>
</p><p>
That's just about the entire script. If I run it on November 7, 2016, the
moon is 47% illuminated, which makes it a quarter moon (45%&ndash;55%), so the
output is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
The moon is currently quarter with 47% illuminated.
</pre>
</p><p>
A few days later, on November 10, the output is what you would hope:

<pre     class="programlisting">
The moon is currently waxing gibbous with 78% illuminated.
</pre>
</p><p>
Done. Nice and easy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x232d580.0x24269b0"></a>
Creeping Featurism</h2></div></div><p>
You could do plenty of things with this script to improve it and
make it more powerful and flexible. The easiest would be simply to rewrite that
output line so it's less grammatically awkward:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "It's a $phasename moon that's $illumlevel% illuminated."
</pre>
</p><p>
Now the output will make a bit more sense as the script reports that
&ldquo;It's a waning gibbous moon that's 72% illuminated.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The bigger task is to allow users to specify a date and calculate the
values for that particular date (including the day prior to the date
specified). I would do this using the same basic <tt  >date
-v</tt> approach, but
first parse users' input and break it down into month, day and
year. For simplicity's sake, constrain their input to a MM/DD/YYYY
format, and there's surprisingly little involved in the task.
</p><p>
For huge bonus points, of course, a graphical display would be nice. But
that's hard to do with a shell script, right?

the game first so you're ready!
