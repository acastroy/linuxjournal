Panther MPC, Inc.'s Panther Alpha</h2></div></div><p>
Functional, powerful and there when you need it, unobtrusive when you
don't&mdash;that's how Panther MPC, Inc., sums up the company's new
Panther Alpha personal micro PC that features the company's powerful,
easy-to-use Linux-based Panther OS. Panther Alpha combines full desktop
functionality with an ultra-customizable Linux OS that fits in the palm of
your hand. Panther says its new device could be possible only now thanks to
a culmination of years of industry innovation and development, namely the
power of today's ARM chips and an improved emphasis of Linux on ARM. The
Panther Alpha is whisper quiet, with no fan or HDD noises, and is powered by an
energy-efficient ARM quad-core chipset. Unlike most micro PCs, asserts
Panther, the Panther Alpha offers a true desktop experience with mouse,
keyboard input, microSD card slot, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and USB
functionality. The portable and compact shape allows it to integrate
seamlessly into any environment&mdash;business, home or school. &ldquo;The
only PC you'll ever need&rdquo;, adds the company.

PrestaShop</h2></div></div><p>
Helping people overcome the challenges of building and growing an online
business is what the PrestaShop open-source ecommerce platform is all about.
The significant PrestaShop 1.7 release provides innovations focused on three
themes: sell faster, create easier and code better. PrestaShop 1.7 users
will sell faster due to the entirely redesigned UX that helps merchants with
the daily management of their stores via more effective back-office
management and a drastically reduced time to place products online.
PrestaShop 1.7 users will create easier with new features like the starter
theme, a simple and flexible tool with all the functionality needed to
design the perfect store. The starter theme gives web designers significant
opportunity for creativity and customization. Finally, PrestaShop 1.7 users
will code better with the incorporation of new tools and standards, including
the popular Symfony framework and PHP 7 compatibility. The goal is to
improve site performance and code security as well as to facilitate better
development. PrestaShop 1.7 is already available in 25 languages and through
community crowdsourcing, it gradually will be available in many more.

VMware's Clarity Design System</h2></div></div><p>
By combining user experience (UX) guidelines and patterns with the front-end
code in one solution, VMware's Clarity Design System represents a new
concept in the design systems space. Clarity Design System is VMware's
open-source project&mdash;&ldquo;designed by designers and built by
developers&rdquo;&mdash;that unites UX, HTML/CSS and Angular for creating cohesive
experiences for any application. VMware began building Clarity based on
readily apparent needs for an internal design system that unified
VMware's portfolio of products and accelerated product development
through reusable components. Building alongside product teams, the Clarity
team was able to tackle the complexities of enterprise use cases while
striving for simplicity familiar to consumer applications. Now dozens of
VMware product teams have adopted Clarity internally in their work.

Goldtouch Semi-Vertical Mouse</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;A brilliant combination of ergonomics, comfort and
performance&rdquo;
thunders Goldtouch, a leader in desktop ergonomics, about its new
Semi-Vertical Mouse. &ldquo;Perfectly sloped at 66 degrees&rdquo; to prevent
wrist stress and provide the ultimate comfort fit for healthy computing, the
Semi-Vertical Mouse is Goldtouch's newest addition to its mouse library.
The new mouse provides a happy medium between the traditional ergonomic
mouse (sloped at 25&ndash;30&deg;) and the traditional vertical mouse (sloped
between 85&ndash;90&deg;). The in-between slope guides users into a comfortable
grip, provides a nice resting position for the hand and enhances the user
experience through great mousing precision. Goldtouch says that the
Semi-Vertical Mouse expands its already wide variety of ergonomic solutions
to fit every type of user and user preference.

Gordon H. Williams' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Making Things Smart</em></span> (Maker Media, Inc.)</h2></div></div><p>
Pretty much anything in the O'Reilly spin-off Make: series is like catnip
to us Linux cats, and the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Making Things Smart</em></span> is no exception. The
book is subtitled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Easy Embedded ARM Programming For Transforming Everyday
Objects Into Intelligent Machines</em></span> and is authored by Gordon H. Williams. The
book is Williams' tool for teaching readers the fundamentals of the
powerful ARM microcontroller by walking beginners and experienced users
alike through easily assembled projects composed of inexpensive,
hardware-store parts. In rebellion to the many current ARM programming books
that take a bland, textbook-ish approach with focus on complex,
beginner-unfriendly languages&mdash;think C or ARM
Assembler&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Making Things
Smart</em></span> utilizes Espruino (JavaScript for Hardware) to flatten the learning
curve.

Buddy Platform Limited's Parse on Buddy Service</h2></div></div><p>
With Facebook's Parse mobile back end as a service shutting down in January
2017, developers are in a bind. The vise is squeezing tighter since the
open-source Parse Server product released by Facebook, asserts Buddy
Platform Limited, was not designed to support high volume, commercial-grade
apps from organizations seeking the breadth of the original platform. To
solve this issue and facilitate an easy migration path to a robust
alternative, Buddy launched an enterprise-grade Parse service offering
called Parse on Buddy. Parse on Buddy's developer says that its solution
is closest to the original Parse service, including many features not part
of the Parse Server codebase released to the Open Source community (for
example,
cloud code, multiple apps per account support, PPNS, file storage and
more). Parse on Buddy was designed to be as familiar to developers as
possible, right down to using the same pricing model. It also features an
easy three-step migration process for apps still on the original Parse
service that requires only a small change to a mobile app's codebase and no
remapping of APIs or other new code.

SoftMaker's FlexiPDF</h2></div></div><p>
Editing PDFs is now as easy as word processing. This is SoftMaker's
promise thanks to its new FlexiPDF 2017, a new PDF editor that &ldquo;masters
the creation of new PDF files as well as the editing of text, graphics and
drawings in existing ones&rdquo;. Available in Standard and Professional
versions, FlexiPDF goes far beyond basic editing functions, empowering users
to change almost any aspect of PDF files. Just like in standard word
processors, FlexiPDF 2017 offers an integrated track changes function,
built-in spell checker, commenting function, search and replace,
highlighting and exporting of PDFs to TextMaker, HTML, RTF, Microsoft Word
and EPUB formats. The integrated OCR function in FlexiPDF converts
scans into editable PDF files. FlexiPDF comes with its own PDF printer
driver that lets users create high-quality PDFs directly from within any
Windows application that can print. FlexiPDF Professional is perfect for the
translation of PDF files into other languages. This is because it extracts
the text of a PDF document in a format that can be opened by common
translation programs. It then imports the translation back to the original
PDF document&mdash;in exactly the right spot.
