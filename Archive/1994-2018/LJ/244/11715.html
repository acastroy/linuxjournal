What's more fun than working with Linux? Playing with Linux!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1816580.0x190e358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I talked about the various techie ways I personally manage
the health and exercise issues in my life. This time, I want to talk about
nerdy entertainment, and how technology influences the fun parts of my
day-to-day existence. Not that health and exercise aren't fun&mdash;but, you
know what I mean. Let's consider these two articles a &ldquo;summer
vacation&rdquo;
from the server room and command line. For those of you in the southern
hemisphere, it can be an extended winter break. For my next article, 
I'll put my virtual work clothes on and teach some Linux, but here it's
about making technology serve our entertainment whims.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1816580.0x190e568"></a>
Games</h2></div></div><p>
Let's face it, sometimes it rains and you can't go outside. Sometimes
it's too sunny, and if you go outside you'll burn. And sometimes, you're
an insomniac, up all night with nothing to comfort you but the
pale blue glow of a monitor. Whatever excuse you need to tell yourself,
gaming on Linux is better than it's ever been (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11715f1.large.jpg"><img src="11715f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. <span  class="emphasis"><em>GT Racing</em></span> has awesome graphics, incredible gameplay and is
fairly easy to play.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Steam:</b></span>
</p><p>
Few things have helped the Linux gaming scene as much as the folks at
Valve providing a native Linux version of the Steam platform. No, not all
games are available for Linux, but there is a surprisingly large number
that is. Whether you like to shoot zombies with the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Left-4-Dead</em></span> franchise
or prefer to play Indie games, which often have incredible gameplay
while sacrificing big-budget special effects, Steam is a resource
for tons of awesome games. Download the client and start building your
library now: <a href="http://www.steampowered.com" target="_self">www.steampowered.com</a>. (If you don't like Steam, check out
Desura, which is a similar concept: <a href="http://www.desura.com" target="_self">www.desura.com</a>.)
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Android:</b></span>
</p><p>
Just saying &ldquo;Android&rdquo; isn't really specific enough anymore. Google's
mobile operating system is getting embedded into more and more products
every day. In this particular case, however, I'm referring to phones and
tablets. Although there certainly are epic games available for Android,
I find the quick and challenging games are the most fun. While I
personally never understood the draw of games like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Flappy
Bird</em></span>, I
will admit to hours &lt;strike&gt;lost&lt;/strike&gt; invested into
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Angry Birds</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Candy Crush</em></span> (Figure 2). In fact, Android is becoming such
a gaming platform, many games are being cross-compiled for PCs and
Android (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/GAME" target="_self">https://play.google.com/store/apps/category/GAME</a>).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11715f2.large.jpg"><img src="11715f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Perhaps the birds are angry that we keep forcing them to hurl
themselves at pigs.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Ouya, Fire TV and Roku:</b></span>
</p><p>
Remember plugging your Atari 2600 in to the black-and-white television
and playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pac-Man</em></span> with a single-button joystick? No?
Fine. Do you
remember plugging your Nintendo in to the living-room TV and playing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Legend of Zelda</em></span> with a boxy controller? Well, even if your earliest
console gaming memories are of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wii Bowling</em></span>, the latest Android-powered
gaming devices should be reminiscent of those old days, with a modern
twist. Gaming and streaming entertainment are starting to merge together
as the platforms mature, and devices like the Roku are proof. Whether
you want to stream old episodes of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek</em></span> or fling angry birds at
naughty pigs, these new console devices are easy to use and fun to play
with (<a href="http://www.ouya.com" target="_self">www.ouya.com</a>, <a href="http://amazon.com/firetv" target="_self">amazon.com/firetv</a> and <a href="http://www.roku.com" target="_self">www.roku.com</a>).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Humble Bundle:</b></span>
</p><p>
I've mentioned the Humble Bundle folks before. It's a great
organization that sells Indie products and raises money for charities. As
it happens, it also supports Linux and Android platforms with most of
its game releases. Be sure to read closely, however, because although the
Humble Bundle folks try to find developers who support cross-platform
gaming, sometimes the &ldquo;bundles&rdquo; are Windows-only. Because
there's typically
a new bundle every few weeks, it's not usually a big deal, however. Just
be careful before you click.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1816580.0x190f430"></a>
Video</h2></div></div><p>
I already used the rain excuse, and the insomnia excuse is just
depressing, but whatever your reason for being inside, watching the
television is a time-honored way to kill the time. Healthy? Probably
not, but that was last article's topic; here it's all about fun. And
personally, I love to watch the TV!
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Plex:</b></span>
</p><p>
I've written in length about Plex and Plexmediaserver in past issues,
so I won't belabor the point much more. It's impossible to talk about
Linux-based video-watching without bringing up one of my favorite
consumption methods though, so here it is. Plex is awesome. You can
watch your personal video collection on a plane, in a car, in a box,
with a fox&mdash;anywhere you happen to be, your video collection is
available to you. You even can make individual videos available off-line
for those rainy camping trips out of cell tower range. My only remaining
frustration with Plex? It doesn't support playlists. Thankfully, that's
in the works for future versions (<a href="http://www.plex.tv" target="_self">www.plex.tv</a>). For playback on your own
network, it's hard to beat the XBMC interface, which is what I still
use on our TVs (<a href="http://www.xbmc.org" target="_self">www.xbmc.org</a>).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Roku and Fire TV:</b></span>
</p><p>
I know, I mentioned these in the gaming section, but gaming is really a
secondary function. These are both Android-based streaming devices. The
Roku has a huge market share, which is interesting because it doesn't
actually produce or stream content of its own. I find that refreshing,
because it means the platform doesn't favor one video source over
another. The Amazon Fire TV, on the other hand, does favor Amazon
products. This isn't shocking, but it does admittedly allow for a number
of third-party apps. Both devices support Netflix and Hulu, and have a
native Plex app! If you want Plex on a television, it's hard to beat a
Roku or FireTV (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11715f3.large.jpg"><img src="11715f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Amazon Fire TV is a media streamer and a low-end gaming
system. The interface is sleek, and if you're an Amazon user, it will be
convenient.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Backyard Drive-in:</b></span>
</p><p>
It might sound cheesy, but if you're a little adventurous, an outdoor
movie screening is incredibly fun. Make sure there are blankets for the
ground, or some chairs, and provide bug spray along with the popcorn. I
actually recommend using a yard fogger to keep the bugs at bay. The tech
side is fairly simple. Find a light-colored building or hang up a white
bed sheet, and use a projector to create your outdoor
&ldquo;theater&rdquo;. It helps
to have some good speakers, and tons of popcorn. I find 1980s action movies
or cheesy B-rate horror films to be the best choices, but your tastes
will likely vary. The fun part for the kids is waiting until after dark
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>start</em></span> the movie. They almost never last through the whole movie,
but it's fun for the whole family (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11715f4.large.jpg"><img src="11715f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Music</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Streaming Music:</b></span>
</p><p>
We've gotten to the point with music that finding ways to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>get</em></span> songs
is super simple. Tools like Google Music's matching program (or iTunes
&ldquo;Match&rdquo; subscription service) mean our music is always available to us
from the cloud. Oddly, I don't own very much music, because I'm fickle
and switch tastes often. For me, the streaming services like Pandora
are ideal, because based on my likes and dislikes, they pick songs I'll
probably enjoy. And, they're usually correct. Like I mentioned, there
are tons of platforms for music. Rhapsody, Spotify, Last.FM, Pandora,
Google Music&mdash;whatever style of consumption appeals to your particular
taste is available.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Music Hardware:</b></span>
</p><p>
I know, you're thinking, &ldquo;Shawn, 'music hardware' is called
'speakers'&rdquo;,
but I mean more than just speakers. For instance, I like to listen to
audiobooks in the shower. It means that a good book will sometimes result
in 
running out of hot water, but I still enjoy listening to them nevertheless. I
tried a wide variety of Bluetooth-enabled shower speakers, and quite
frankly, they all stink. I'm hoping someone has found one that is loud
enough for old deaf people like me, but so far, I have a drawer full of
tinny-sounding Bluetooth devices with suction cups. If you know of a good
Bluetooth speaker designed for the shower, please let me know! I'll be
sure to write about it in a future issue and give you praise and credit!
</p><p>
Something I've been working on more recently is a portable speaker system
for the backyard. I could open the window and jam a speaker into it, but
I really want to control the music from my phone. My current solution is
to cram some powered speakers into a laundry basket, and connect it to
something like the D-Link WiFi Audio Extender so I can stream wirelessly
to wherever I set the basket. In fact, the folks at D-Link sent me their
newest model (the DCH-M225), and I'm going to try to make a proper weekend
project out of building the perfect portable jam center. If it works,
I'll write about it in a future issue. If it fails, I'll probably post
sad pictures on our Twitter feed (Figure 5).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11715f5.large.jpg"><img src="11715f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. My first mobile speaker attempt is a bit sad. Still, it works in
a pinch. The next version will be <span  class="emphasis"><em>much</em></span> nicer!

Books, Mmmm, Books</h2></div></div><p>
I love reading. This is probably not a surprise, since I'm a writer,
a nerd, socially awkward and get a sunburn from thinking warm
thoughts. I've spent a lot of time indoors, and a lot of that time has
been in faraway places with aliens and trolls. When I was younger, I had
to brave the outdoors long enough to walk the couple miles to the local
library. Now, I have an endless supply of alternate realities at the
literal tips of my fingers. And the eBook revolution has only just begun!
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Audible:</b></span>
</p><p>
I must admit, my hectic lifestyle means that most of my reading is done
while I'm driving my kids from one appointment or sporting event to
the next. (My kids, unlike their father, are fairly athletic&mdash;I don't
understand genetics.) Since reading a book while driving is illegal and
a poor example for my kids, I tend to listen to books more than read
them. Audible is a great way to get the most recent books delivered
seamlessly. The Android app will sync your spot with a Kindle eBook if
you buy both versions, so you can read at stoplights if you really prefer
the written word. I don't suggest that though, as it seems dangerous!
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Non-Audible Audiobooks:</b></span>
</p><p>
The only downside of audiobooks is the cost. Mind you, the cost is
understandable, because the author, narrator and entire production
crew deserve to be paid for their work, but it means that instead
of $7 for a paperback, it's $25 for a performance. There are other
audiobook resellers, but the selections are never as good as Audible,
and the prices aren't much better. Thankfully, there's another option,
depending on where you live&mdash;the library.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the availability of audiobooks varies widely from library
to library. When I lived in a city, my local library had more audiobooks
than I ever could listen to, plus, the librarians almost always would buy a book if I
requested they add it to their library! Now that we're in a small town,
the local library doesn't have the budget to carry a large selection. Your
library
might be able to import physical copies of audiobooks for you, but the
on-line digital stuff is really the nicest. If you have friends or
relatives in a
big city who don't use their local library, perhaps you could work out
a deal with them. I'll leave the moral implications up to you to sort out.
</p><p>
Generally with a library, you get free access to a number of
audiobooks at a time. The Overdrive app is the standard method used
to access those books. Libraries still are sorting out DRM issues,
and some books are available only on Windows-compatible listening
devices. That really annoys me, so I tend to find ways to strip
the DRM from the books and listen to them on whatever darn device I
want (generally an Android device running the SmartAudiobook Player
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/android-candy-smart-audiobook-player" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/android-candy-smart-audiobook-player</a>).
Again, there are moral implications. Nevertheless, the library is a great resource
for audiobooks. Sometimes, the selection is amazing. Even if it isn't,
contact the librarians&mdash;sometimes they have a budget for ordering
more books, but they're just waiting for requests. Find the app at
<a href="http://omc.overdrive.com" target="_self">omc.overdrive.com</a>, and ask at your local library
about its
digital options (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11715f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The Overdrive app is really slick, but is only as useful as the
selection your library offers. (Photo courtesy of <a href="http://overdrive.com" target="_self">overdrive.com</a>.)

Book Books</h2></div></div><p>
I know, for many of you, nothing ever will replace dead tree pulp and
ink. I still painfully remember the years of Letters to the Editor sharing
everyone's frustration when <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> switched to digital. Thankfully,
eBooks and their reading devices continue to improve year after year. Now,
like with music, there are so many ways to get and read eBooks, it can
be overwhelming.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
The Standard Stores:</b></span>
</p><p>
Amazon (Kindle), Barnes &amp; Noble (Nook), Apple (iDevices), Google Play
(Android devices), plus a ton of smaller companies sell eBooks. With most
companies, the idea is to lock you in to their ecosystem, so you always
will buy from them instead of bargain shopping for the best price. This is
both good and bad. Companies like Amazon make the purchasing and reading
experience so seamless and pain-free that it's hard to go elsewhere,
even if a book might be less expensive from a competitor. You're paying
for convenience along with the book itself.
</p><p>
It's certainly possible to install all the major apps on your Android
device and read a book on whatever platform you could buy it for the
cheapest, but most of us tend to like a consistent interface and don't
want our book selections splintered across various cloud accounts. I'm
horribly guilty of this, and I tend to buy all my books from one particular
vendor. In fact, it wasn't until I started buying eBook bundles from
Humble Bundle that I had to rethink my eBook collection.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Humble Bundle:</b></span>
</p><p>
Yes, the same folks who provide the awesome selection of games on
a regular basis now also provide eBook bundles. The bundles usually
contain books from authors I love, and I really like to support the
charities by purchasing books. You pay what you want, and the money gets
split among various charities along with the author. (As it happens,
Linux users are always the top contributors per capita. Go freedom!)
</p><p>
These DRM-free eBooks are just downloads and aren't part of
any cloud ecosystem. That meant I had to come up with some way
to consolidate my eBook library in one place. Thankfully, Calibre
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/calibre-cloud" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/calibre-cloud</a>) is a great tool for
managing an eBook collection. Yes, it means stripping some DRM off my
Amazon books, but having all my books in one &ldquo;library&rdquo; is like a salve
for my OCD.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
The Overdrive Library Again:</b></span>
</p><p>
Remember the Overdrive program for listening to audiobooks from the
library? Well it also does eBooks and includes an app for reading
the library-loaned eBooks you check out. I do think it allows for
an unfortunate side effect in that going to the library is no longer
necessary for reading books, but that's just nostalgia on my part. I'm
thrilled libraries are evolving, and I urge you to check out your local
library's digital collection!
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Oyster:</b></span>
</p><p>
Finally, I leave you with Oyster. You may have read about it in the
UpFront section of this issue, as it won this month's Editors' Choice
award. Oyster is basically the Netflix of the book world. With a $9.95
subscription and an app on your phone and/or tablet, you get unlimited
access to more than a half-million books! Read about it in the UpFront section,

Build Your Own Adventure</h2></div></div><p>
Honestly, after all the years of working as a sysadmin, writing for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> and just being a geek, my favorite Linux pastime is learning. I
love to build projects like BirdCam (<a href="http://birds.brainofshawn.com" target="_self">birds.brainofshawn.com</a>). I'm
excited every time I can solve a household problem with a Raspberry Pi
(the digital fireplace in my family room, for instance). And it's all I
can do not to quit writing this article so I can go build my outdoor,
mobile, wireless speaker system for streaming music in the backyard.
</p><p>
Whatever your favorite Linux adventure might be, hopefully some of the
things I discussed here make those adventures more fun. At the
very least, I hope you check out your local library to see what sort of
digital offerings it provides. It's awesome to see an establishment
as old as the library move into the next phase of free knowledge
sharing. Libraries understood the idea of open source before the term
even meant something. Enjoy the rest of your summer (or winter!) everyone,
and get ready for next issue, when we're back in the classroom.
