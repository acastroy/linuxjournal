Credit cards cause itches for all of us. Let's scratch them.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1253580.0x134b300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A friend who works in one of the big banks recently told me that any
new-fangled approach to identity and payments is going to have a hard time
getting traction while credit cards continue to work as well as they do.
&ldquo;Using credit cards is too easy, too normal, too entrenched in Business As
Usual&rdquo;, he said. They used to say the same thing about Windows.
</p><p>
As it happens, I am in the middle of a credit-card mess right now that is
certainly normal and Business As Usual, but far from easy.
</p><p>
See, all I'm trying to do is buy something on-line, from a retailer that's not
Amazon. (I'm not going to name names, beyond saying that much.) First, the
retailer's system for sorting out billing and shipping addresses was broken.
Then, after I got over that hurdle (which I suppose is still there), my
credit card was declined. In the course of dealing with both failures, I have
pounded countless numbers and letters, over and over again, into my laptop's
keyboard and my phone's screen. On top of that, I have had to give the last
four digits of my social security number, plus a bunch of other information,
over and over again, to too many different people at the credit-card company's
call centers.
</p><p>
The credit-card company doesn't know (or seem to care) why my card was
declined. The attempted purchase was not unusual in any way. The error
message from the retailer was also unhelpful. It said, &ldquo;Something went wrong
when trying to process your payment. Please review the error message and try
again: Braintree payment for Order #5283 (Transaction ID gb3xx6m) was
declined: Declined.&rdquo; For the last several hours, the credit-card company 
also has been unable to turn off the fraud protection flag that caused it to
decline the purchase in the first place, because its system for doing that
is down.
</p><p>
Several more hours have passed between the last paragraph and this one, which
I'm writing after calling the credit-card company for the Nth time and
learning at last that the payment went through. The retailer's system,
however, still says &ldquo;awaiting payment&rdquo;.
</p><p>
I don't know if any of the new ideas for solving this kind of mess are going
to succeed. Most of them probably won't. But I do believe the only answers
that will finally work are ones that give us ways to be known in the virtual
world that resemble the ways we are known in the physical one.
</p><p>
For a base-level model of that, let's say I go into coffee shop and order a
cortado (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortado" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortado</a>). A cortado has the ideal
ratio of coffee and steamed milk. It's also known as a piccolo latte in some
places, such as Australia
(<a href="http://www.cafeculture.com/general-interest/what-is-a-piccolo-latte" target="_self">www.cafeculture.com/general-interest/what-is-a-piccolo-latte</a>).
Try it out. Here is what happens around identity and payment:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
I am anonymous&mdash;literally, nameless. But...
</p></li><li><p>
They can see I am a person, with an obvious ability to pay.
</p></li><li><p>
They accept payment either via cash or credit card.
</p></li><li><p>
If I use cash, it's also anonymous, even though there is a unique number on
every piece of paper currency. The shop is not interested in those numbers.
</p></li><li><p>
If I use a card, they do not care about the name on the card or the number.
All they care about is whether the payment goes through. In other
words, they are not burdened with any details about me. (I am purposely
keeping loyalty cards and other marketing gimmicks off the table here. I'll
explain why below.)
</p></li><li><p>
If they ask for a name, it's only so they can call it out when the drink is
ready. Not for any other reason.
</p></li><li><p>
That's it.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Now, let's say this is a coffee shop where I am already known to the people
behind the counter. Here the only difference is that I might be extended some
friendly courtesies. If the people are honorable, I can expect that they
won't be out to screw me&mdash;for example, by giving or selling information
about me to people or systems I don't know.
</p><p>
There are permissions and agreements, casual and formal, on both sides of
this system, and they have been in the vernacular of every market since the
dawn of commerce. When this system works well, there is also no power
asymmetry&mdash;or at least not one being exploited. The customer and the
shop meet as equals in the marketplace. They trust each other. This trust has
a high degree of leverage toward future business between both parties. In
terms of game theory
(<a href="http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/prisoners-dilemma" target="_self">www.beyondintractability.org/essay/prisoners-dilemma</a>), that leverage is toward positive sum (aka win-win)
outcomes (<a href="http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/sum" target="_self">www.beyondintractability.org/essay/sum</a>).
</p><p>
On the whole, we have positive sum outcomes from the game played with credit
cards. But there is a degree of entrapment to that game as well. We are not
equals, and we do not enjoy full agency.
</p><p>
This is not the fault of the credit-card system, but of mass marketing's
obsolete methods and assumptions, which date back to the time when Industry
won the Industrial Revolution. In order to get scale&mdash;to market to
masses&mdash;it was necessary for companies to treat many customers the same
way, as populations rather than as individual human beings. Even in the
Internet Age, attempts by business to &ldquo;personalize&rdquo; and
&ldquo;mass customize&rdquo;
relations with customers are made by business&mdash;not by the customer.
</p><p>
And, because business mostly talks only to itself about this stuff, it is
easy for business to rationalize negative externalities
(<a href="http://economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php" target="_self">economics.fundamentalfinance.com/negative-externality.php</a>). Among those
externalities are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Wastes heaped by others&mdash;for example, all the promotional crap that
fills communication channels and brings no positive response (in other words,
99.x% of all promotional messages).
</p></li><li><p>
Inconveniences&mdash;such as the need by users and customers to authenticate in
separate and arcane ways with every different company's different system.
</p></li><li><p>
Resentments and other bad feelings by users and customers toward both of the
above, plus knowledge that they are being spied upon and manipulated in ways
they cannot escape without giving up relationships they can't or won't do
without.
</p></li><li><p>
Companies needing to maintain or hire the large and expensive server farms
and &ldquo;big data&rdquo; crunching systems to process and make decisions on personal
data gained by surveillance and fed back to #1, above.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
All those negative externalities afflict the commercial Web today&mdash;and
are spreading into brick-and-mortar retailing as well. We see this with
loyalty programs (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program</a>) that give us additional cards and key tags to carry around.
</p><p>
These externalities exist to a far lesser degree with credit cards than they
do with marketing gimmicks (because credit cards' purposes are mostly
restricted to transactions), but are still present with credit cards, as we
see with my own story, above.
</p><p>
Einstein (is said to have) said &ldquo;The significant problems we face cannot be
solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them&rdquo;
(<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_self">en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein</a>). I can
remember like it was yesterday the feeling of futility I had when I was doing
work for Sun Microsystems, back in the 1980s, enduring the torture of
sitting in meetings where the pointless topic was &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; UNIX, which had a
zillion variants, most of which were owned by somebody, including Sun. There
was no way UNIX's problems could be solved at that level. We needed Gnu and
Linux to solve it. (And yes, the BSDs too.) That's how I feel today about
trying to fix identity and payments inside the current mass-marketing system.
</p><p>
The level at which we need to solve identity and payments is the individual
one. It needs to happen on our side. We're the ones who need to manage our
identities, how we pay for stuff, what information we hand over when we pay
for things, and how we control our side of relations with the retailers and
service providers of the world.
</p><p>
Today there are already many new projects that start with the customer and
move toward business. I'm involved in many of those, through ProjectVRM
(<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm" target="_self">blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm</a>). (Here
is a partial list of developers:
<a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work" target="_self">cyber.law.harvard.edu/projectvrm/VRM_Development_Work</a>.) And, I consult some of those formally as
well. But I won't name any, because I want clean new Linux geek thinking and
code-writing applied to this problem.
</p><p>
Here's the main challenge: not using cards at all. Bitcoin
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin</a>) is the biggest
breakthrough in that direction, so far&mdash;or at least the one with the most
geek interest.
</p><p>
What else have we got&mdash;or could we have? The answers will come, because
there's a huge itch here.
</p><p>
So tell me who's scratching what, and how. I'd rather salute those than
complain more about Business As Usual.
