<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #244, August 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One problem with Linux has been its implementation of <span   class="bold"><b>system calls</b></span>. As
<span   class="bold"><b>Andy
Lutomirski</b></span> pointed out recently, it's very messy. Even identifying which
system calls were implemented for which architectures, he said, was very
difficult, as was identifying the mapping between a call's name and its
number, and mapping between call argument registers and system call
arguments.
</p><p>
Some user programs like <span   class="bold"><b>strace</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>glibc</b></span> needed to know this sort of
information, but their way of gathering it together&mdash;although well
accomplished&mdash;was very messy too.
</p><p>
Andy proposed slogging through the kernel code and writing up a text file
that would serve as a &ldquo;master list&rdquo; of system calls, giving the call name,
the corresponding call number, the supported architectures and other
information. Among other things, this would allow tools like glibc to
eliminate their ugly implementations and use a simple library to get this
information out of the kernel.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span> liked the idea, but said it would take a lot of work to get
it right. He mentioned that he'd been advocating something along the same
lines for a long time, dating back to his work on <span   class="bold"><b>klibc</b></span>.
</p><p>
Various other folks liked Andy's idea as well&mdash;particularly anyone
involved with user code that currently had to deduce system call
organization piecemeal. <span   class="bold"><b>David Howells</b></span> remarked that it would be wonderful
if strace could rely on Andy's master list as well. And, <span   class="bold"><b>Michael Kerrisk</b></span>
said the <span   class="bold"><b>manpages project</b></span> also would be interested in tracking the progress
of the master list.
</p><p>
There's always a special case that would benefit from tweaking the
<span   class="bold"><b>process
scheduler</b></span> just a little bit beyond The Good. Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Khalid Aziz</b></span> from
<span   class="bold"><b>Oracle</b></span> submitted some code to allow user processes to claim additional timeslices. Typically, the kernel itself controls that sort of resource
allocation, because otherwise the system is dependent on the friendliness
or well-codedness of user applications.
</p><p>
But, Khalid's database folks had noticed a problem with large numbers of
threads vying for the same mutex. If one of those threads had the mutex and
was almost ready to give it up, the scheduler might run through the whole
queue of other processes, none of which could actually run because they
were all waiting for that one mutex. And like a thumb in the eye, the
process holding the mutex was all set to give it up, but couldn't, since it
had been preempted. Much better, Khalid said, would be to allow the process
holding the mutex to delay preemption, long enough to give up that mutex.
Then all the other processes could take their turn and do actual work,
rather than spend their precious timeslices spinning on an unavailable
lock.
</p><p>
Khalid said his code showed a 3&ndash;5% speedup relative to the previous case.
But, there was still a fair bit of reluctance to accept his code into the
kernel. 
</p><p>
In particular, H. Peter Anvin pointed out that Khalid's code allowed
userspace to transform the kernel's natural preemptive multitasking into a
cooperative multitasking model, in which processes all had to agree on who
would get timeslices, and when&mdash;and some processes could aggressively claim
timeslices at the expense of the others.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Davidlohr Bueso</b></span> pointed out that a voluntary preemption model might work
better with the kernel's existing implementation, allowing processes to
give up their timeslice to another process voluntarily. There was no
danger from hostile processes there.
</p><p>
There were various suggestions for alternatives to Khalid's design, but
Khalid always pointed out that his way was fastest. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Gleixner</b></span>
said that &ldquo;It's a horrible idea. What you are creating is a crystal
ball-based form of time-bound priority ceiling with the worst userspace
interface I've ever seen.&rdquo;
</p><p>
That was the real problem, apparently. Giving user code the ability to
preempt the normal scheduling process meant that neither the kernel nor
other userspace processes could predict the behavior of the system, or even
properly debug problems.
</p><p>
At one point Thomas said, &ldquo;What you're trying to do is essentially creating
an ABI which we have to support and maintain forever. And that definitely
is worth a few serious questions.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;If we allow you
to special-case your database workload, then we have no argument why we should not do
the same thing for real-time workloads where the <span   class="bold"><b>SCHED_FAIR</b></span> housekeeping
thread can hold a lock shortly to access some important data in the
<span   class="bold"><b>SCHED_FIFO</b></span> real-time computation thread. Of course the RT people want to
avoid the lock contention as much as you do, just for different
reasons.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Eric W. Biederman</b></span> also objected to
Khalid's code, saying, &ldquo;You allow any
task to extend its timeslice. Which means I will get the question why does
why does really_important_job only miss its latency guarantees when
running on the same box as sched_preempt_using_job?&rdquo; And he said,
&ldquo;Your
change appears to have extremely difficult to debug non-local
effects.&rdquo;
</p><p>
There seems to be a lot of interest in implementing a feature like what
Khalid has proposed, but there also seems to be security concerns,
debugability concerns and maintainability concerns that make the whole
thing very iffy. But, it's still possible that Khalid could address those
concerns and come up with a patch that does what the database people want,
without the mess.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Oyster&mdash;Netflix for Books!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #244, August 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For avid readers who can't find the time to visit their local library
or struggle to carry giant tomes of awesomeness around with them,
eBooks have become a convenient way to consume books. Whether it's on a
Kindle, a Nook or in an app on your phone, eBooks are the ultimate in
portability. Sometimes, however, it can be difficult to find the book
you want in a format you can read. Enter Oyster (<a href="http://www.oysterbooks.com" target="_self">www.oysterbooks.com</a>).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11702androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Netflix has taken movie streaming to the point where it's more common to
stream a movie than it is to rent a DVD. Heck, many of us have abandoned
all television entertainment options <span   class="emphasis"><em>except</em></span> Netflix. Oyster is an app
designed to do the same for books. For $9.95 a month, you get access to
more than a half-million books and enjoy unlimited reading on your Android-powered device.
</p><p>
The app features cross-device (and cross-platform) location sync, off-line
reading and a 30-day free trial with unlimited book reading. Like
Netflix, Oyster does use DRM on its titles. Because the books aren't
ever owned by me, I personally don't have a moral dilemma with DRM in
this case, but for some it will be a showstopper. Nevertheless, due
to its wide selection, awesome idea and cross-platform availability,
Oyster takes this month's Editors' Choice award!

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: a Virtualized Cisco Infrastructure?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #244, August 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
We're all familiar with the idea of virtualized computers. Not only
are they a great way to better utilize resources in a server room,
but they also allow you to create and destroy servers in the blink of an
eye. That's perfect for a lab or training environment. Unfortunately,
it's always taken a rack of actual hardware to create a training lab
for Cisco hardware. Thanks to GNS3 (Graphical Network Simulator 3),
that's no longer the case.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11702fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11702fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
GNS3 is an open-source application that creates a virtual infrastructure
of Cisco (or other) hardware. Not only can you watch the traffic flow,
but you also can connect directly to the virtual devices and configure them
like the actual hardware devices they represent. On the surface, it looks
like a Visio diagram, but it's a diagram that actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> something!
</p><p>
Whether you're actively trying to learn to use Cisco devices or
just want to try out some networking scenarios, GNS3 is an incredible
tool for sandboxing network hardware. It does require you to provide the
IOS firmware (they can't provide Cisco's operating systems themselves),
but that's it. It works under Windows, along with OS X and Linux. If
you're interested, download a copy today at <a href="http://www.gns3.net" target="_self">www.gns3.net</a>.

<h2 class="title">Getting Good Vibrations with Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #244, August 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Vibrations and wave motions describe many different physical systems. In
fact, most systems that dissipate energy do so through waves of one form
or another. In this article, I take a look at gvb (Good ViBrations, <a href="http://www.pietrobattiston.it/gvb" target="_self">www.pietrobattiston.it/gvb</a>), a Linux
application you can use to visualize and model wave motion and
vibrations. 
</p><p>
Installation should be relatively easy. It
already should exist in the packaging system of most distributions. For
example, on Debian-based systems, you can install it with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install gvb
</pre>
</p><p>
You will notice that a large number of Python requirements also
are installed. This gives you an idea of what you need as requirements
if you want to build gvb from source.
</p><p>
Now that you have gvb and its requirements installed, you can start
it by running the command <tt  >gvb</tt>. When it starts, you will
see a main display window with a pane on the right-hand side with
calculation options. In the main window, there will be a starting sine
wave form.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11702gvbf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you first start gvb, you will see a sine wave ready to start modeling.
</p></div></div><p>
Just to make sure that everything is working, you can
click on the start button in the right-hand pane. This starts the
calculations used to model the wave motion and shows each time step
in the main display window. You should see the evolution of a basic sine
wave happening. 
</p><p>
Let's use this starting waveform to play with some
of the available calculation options. The first option is the speed
of the wave. You can change this while the wave is being modeled and
animated, so you can see in real time how the wave changes with a different
speed. 
</p><p>
Below the start button are three available options. The calculation
drop-down lets you change the algorithm used to do the calculations. The
default is eig, and the other three methods are quad, naif and
naif matrix. When you select any of the other three methods, the step
size option at the top of the pane becomes active. 
</p><p>
You then can change
the size of the steps used in calculating the wave motion. You can set
the number of frames per second to display. The higher this value is,
the smoother your wave animation will be. You probably won't notice any
improvement beyond 30 frames per second, simply due to the limits of human
vision. 
</p><p>
The last option allows you to change what graphics are actually
rendered in the display. Wave shows the waveform itself. Temp displays
a color map representing the amplitude with different colors. Speed
displays the waveform, like Wave, but it also includes a series of bars
along the wave indicating the magnitude of the speed at those points
along the wave. This display helps students get a feeling for how fast
the different parts of the wave are moving.
</p><p>
Before going on, it would be worth spending a few minutes to take a cursory
look at the types of calculations gvb can do. The default calculation
method is eig. This method actually uses the <tt  >eig()</tt> function found
in the linalg part of NumPy. This uses the plane wave expansion method
to get an eigenvalue formulation of the problem and solve that. 
</p><p>
The naif calculation method is a naive method. It simply takes the
current amplitude of the wave at some point and calculates how far it
should travel based on a linear application of the current speed at that
point. 
</p><p>
The naif matrix method just tries to speed up the naif method
by treating the wave as a vector rather than point by point. Neither
of these two methods should be used for any reason other than to see
just how bad they are. 
</p><p>
The last method is quad. This method expands
on the simplistic speed calculation of the naif method with a more
accurate method. In most cases, you simply will want to use the eig
method, as it is the most accurate for most situations.
</p><p>
Up until now, I've only been discussing a sinusoidal wave on a
string. But really interesting things happen when you can look at
other starting waveforms. There are a series of pre-programmed waveforms
available for you under the menu entry
Disposition&rarr;1 dimension: precooked. Here you will find more than a dozen
available options. 
</p><p>
You also may have noticed that there
is also an entry for two-dimensional precooked options. That's right, gvb
can model waves on a membrane as well. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11702gvbf2.large.jpg"><img src="11702gvbf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You even can model waves on a membrane with gvb.
</p></div></div><p>
If you select one of these
precooked options, you should notice that the graphics option is changed
to 3-D, and the type of drawing is changed from rope to membrane. Clicking
the start button will show you how the starting waveform propagates
across the given membrane. Under the Disposition menu entry, there 
also are entries for advanced one- and two-dimensional systems. Selecting one of
these will pop up a new window where you can set the various parameters
for your own model. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11702gvbf3.large.jpg"><img src="11702gvbf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The advanced window allows you to create your own customized waveforms.
</p></div></div><p>
You still are limited to sinusoidal,
triangular, square and peak waves as your base forms. If you have
something even more complicated in mind, you actually can define the
amplitude and speed at each point in a text file. For example, to model
a string, the text file will have three lines. The first line will contain
the shape&mdash;in this case, the number of points along the string. The second
line will contain a series of amplitude values, comma-separated, one for
each point. The third line will contain a series of speed values, comma-separated,
one for each point. You next need to end the file with a new-line character at the end. Then, you can read this into gvb to provide
your starting waveform. This gives you maximum flexibility. You can do
the equivalent two-dimensional input file if you want to model a membrane
rather than a string.
</p><p>
One final thing you may want to do with gvb is generate a movie of the
wave you are modeling. Selecting the menu entry Options&rarr;Save frames as
png will pull up a file selection window. You need to choose a directory
to store all of the image files for each frame of the animation. Once
this is done and you click the start button, a PNG file will be written
out for each frame. In order to generate a movie out of those, you
need to have FFmpeg installed on your system. Then, all you have to do
is change directory to the spot where gvb is writing out these image
files and run the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg -i *.png video.mp4
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you have a video file that you can share displaying the wave evolution
that you are modeling.
</p><p>
As you have seen, gvb can be a very fun application to use. It especially
gives students a more intuitive feel for how waves behave, in both one
and two dimensions. The ability to visualize the speeds for various
sections also helps conceptualize the physics involved. Hopefully, the
teachers out there will keep gvb in mind when they are planning their next
science class to help students understand wave mechanics.

There are lots of cool ideas on the Internet that never really make it out
of the &ldquo;startup&rdquo; phase. IndieBox has been around only for a few months,
but I really, really hope it catches on.
</p><p>
Here's the idea:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Every month, you get a Linux/Mac/Windows-compatible Indie game in
the mail.
</p></li><li><p>
The games come on a really cool USB drive shaped like a credit card
covered in awesome game art. It's like a modern-day Nintendo cartridge.
</p></li><li><p>
Inside the game box (which is also covered in game art), you'll find
posters, keychains, cardboard cutouts, CDs of game music or anything
else the folks at IndieBox can scrape together to make the monthly game
awesome and nostalgic.
</p></li><li><p>
Most months you'll also get a Steam code, because although old-school
boxed games are awesome, Steam still is really convenient.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11702indief1.large.jpg"><img src="11702indief1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
As someone who belongs to a &ldquo;coffee of the month&rdquo; club, I can assure
you that getting a fresh new thing every month in the mail is fun and
exciting. When that new thing is a nostalgic trip to my youth, plus a
really fun cross-platform game? For me, it's worth the $16.99 a month. If
you miss the days of buying games in a box from the department store,
you'll love the IndieBox experience. Check it out at <a href="http://www.theindiebox.com" target="_self">www.theindiebox.com</a>.

Everyone has wasted an afternoon on YouTube clicking through videos of
talking cats, screaming goats and bad-lip-reading renditions of popular
movies. Heck, there are plenty of YouTube videos of me doing odd and
silly things as well. (Does anyone remember 'Buntu Family Theater?) For
important family videos, however, I much prefer to control my own
data. I've tried over the years to keep an archive of home movies and
such in a folder on a server somewhere, but they never get seen because
getting to them in inconvenient. That's where MediaGoblin comes in.

MediaGoblin is an open-source Web-based application that allows you to
host audio, video and photographic media on your own server. It still
allows that media to be easily viewed via the Web, however, so you get
the convenience of YouTube with the security of hosting files yourself.
</p><p>
Hosting your own local version of YouTube might not be your
cup of tea, but for me, it's a great compromise between convenience
and data privacy. If you want to give MediaGoblin a try, head
over to <a href="http://www.mediagoblin.org" target="_self">www.mediagoblin.org</a> and download a copy
today. Or,
check out one of the many publicly hosted installations
to see if you like the interface. The screenshot here is from
