Interested in becoming a Web developer? Here are some tips on where
to start.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a73358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Web is more than 20 years old, and a huge number of developers now
work with it. It used to be enough to be a &ldquo;Webmaster&rdquo;, meaning a
jack of all trades: developer, designer, database administrator and
system administrator. Today, we see increasingly specialized aspects
of Web development&mdash;front-end developers, back-end developers,
devops professionals and then &ldquo;full-stack developers&rdquo;, who can do it
all, or at least claim to.
</p><p>
This increased specialization reflects, in large part, the degree
to which the Web has become huge and essential. Web sites are an
important part of the world economy, and as befits an important part
of the economy, they need to be designed, developed and
maintained like any other type of engineering.
</p><p>
But with the specialization, and with the growth of the Web, also
comes opportunity. During the past few months, my consulting work has
increasingly involved coaching individuals who see the potential
payoff (financial and personal) for becoming Web developers, and who
want to improve their skills in order to do so. These people know if
they manage to learn these skills, they'll be able to find a job,
either with a startup or a large firm&mdash;or even better, starting
their own on-line businesses.
</p><p>
I've been exposed to more and more people who know they want
to work with &ldquo;the Web&rdquo;, and they know they want to develop
software, but they really don't understand the fundamentals or even
where to begin.
</p><p>
So in this article, I describe some of the basics people should know
if they're interested in doing Web development. As a full-stack Web
developer myself, I think it's important for anyone working with
Web technologies to have at least a passing knowledge of each of these
topics: Linux, databases, a server-side language and framework,
and client-side technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).
</p><p>
If you can learn at least a little of each of those, you'll be well on
your way to being able to create Web applications. Moreover, you'll
probably find that one or more parts of this technological
constellation are particularly appealing to you, giving you a sense of
the area in which you want to specialize. Or, if you find that you
enjoy it all, you can be more of a generalist, applying your broad
knowledge to many different aspects of Web applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a737d0"></a>
Linux and Servers</h2></div></div><p>
Perhaps it won't surprise a reader of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> that being
familiar with Linux is a good thing. However, it's not just good, but
essential, given that Linux powers a surprisingly large proportion of
the Web. Not only are many traditional servers running Linux, but
virtualization has become a stable and popular technology, using such
systems as Vagrant, an open-source system that lets you develop on a
virtual machine and then use that same virtual machine in
production.
I must admit that I haven't yet taken the plunge and used Vagrant, but each time I have to wrestle with server configuration or get
something to work on my employee's computer that worked fine on mine,
Vagrant seems like an increasingly good option.
</p><p>
But really, if all you want to do is start with some Web development,
a deep dive into Linux isn't necessary. Yes, you need to
understand some basics, such as directories, users and permissions,
as well as how to install and run programs. You also should know
where your system's log files are&mdash;both general-purpose log files and
also those produced by your HTTP server.
</p><p>
If you're new to the world of Linux administration, learning such
systems as DNS, SMTP and SSL might well confuse more than help you;
try to rely on third parties for as much of this as possible.
</p><p>
Knowing how to use a classic UNIX text editor, such as Emacs or vim,
will help a great deal, even if you're more of a GUI kind of person,
simply because you won't always have access to a GUI. And of course,
learning the ins and outs of UNIX utilities, such as grep and find, will
help tremendously.
</p><p>
I would say that you shouldn't worry too much about all of the
virtualization and container systems that exist&mdash;not because they
are irrelevant, but because they likely will confuse and complicate
your progress, and those are things you can learn over time. If and when you
decide to use Vagrant, Docker or Amazon Web Services, you can
specialize and learn those particulars.
</p><p>
I should add that Linux is a deep and complex system, one that takes
many years to understand and internalize fully. If it seems foreign
and difficult at first, that's only natural, but over time, you'll
customize your environment, learn more about how to work with it and
feel more comfortable working with it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a73b40"></a>
Databases</h2></div></div><p>
There is no requirement that a Web application have a database.
However, in practice, it's rare for a modern Web application not to
use a database at all. (My company's Web site doesn't have a
database, but that's because it's mostly for promotional purposes.
However, my blog does have a database to store posts and comments,
among other things.) I'm an old-school kind of guy, so I believe
that traditional, relational databases with SQL are the right way to
go for many Web applications. However, I do admit that the learning
curve&mdash;of a client-server protocol, of the SQL query language and
of the various tricks involved in a relational database&mdash;can be
steep.
</p><p>
For this reason alone, many people starting off in Web development
have begun to use so-called NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, which
allow you to store complex documents in a format that naturally maps
to objects and modern programming languages, without the overhead of
SQL queries. I can understand this perspective, and if you feel that
learning SQL would be too complex for you, you might indeed want
to go this way.
</p><p>
However, I think there's a reason why relational databases
continue to be so popular, namely because more than 40 years of
research and practice have been so beneficial. I personally think
it's worth the time and effort to work with a relational
database, particularly if you'll be using a high-level language and
object-relational manager (ORM) that handles most of the queries for
you and, thus, hides many of the queries from you. The long-term
benefits of understanding SQL and relational databases, and the
flexibility of a normalized relational database, are still without
peer, in my view.
</p><p>
This doesn't mean I think that all NoSQL is meaningless or
worthless. However, I have found much more utility in key-value
stores, such as Redis, than in NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB,
particularly with the recent advances in PostgreSQL, which make
storing and retrieving JSON objects easy and efficient.
</p><p>
If you're interested in database technology, a great book to try is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Seven Databases in Seven Weeks</em></span>, by Eric Redmond and Jim Wilson, and
published by the Pragmatic Programmers. That book, as the title
describes, is something of a survey course in modern database
technology, looking at a number of different systems and comparing the
advantages of each.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a73e58"></a>
Programming Languages</h2></div></div><p>
Next comes the most important choice, but also the one that
probably causes the greatest number of arguments among developers: the
server-side programming language. Longtime readers of this column
won't be surprised to hear that I think Python and Ruby are likely to
be your best candidates, both because of the languages themselves, and
because the Flask and Sinatra frameworks are simple, powerful and
well documented, with large communities. You can create great Web
applications with these frameworks&mdash;or, if you find that you're
cobbling together too many separate packages, you can move up to
Django and Rails, frameworks that undoubtedly can handle whatever you
throw at them.
</p><p>
Although I personally prefer Ruby for Web development, there's no doubt
that Python is not only capable, but that it's also easier for
newcomers to programming to understand. (I say this after having
taught two to three Python courses every month for the last five years.)
</p><p>
An increasingly popular option is JavaScript, often using node.js, on
the assumption that it's a good idea to use the same language on both
the client (that is, in the browser) and on the server. I haven't yet
found node.js to be a compelling framework, partly because of its use
of the &ldquo;reactor&rdquo; pattern, and partly because I'm used to the comforts
of other, more mature frameworks. But given the huge number of people
working in JavaScript nowadays, and the understandable interest in
reducing the number of languages needed to engage in Web programming,
I would expect JavaScript to become an increasingly viable option for
Web development in general and for newcomers to the field in
particular.
</p><p>
There are other options, as well, such as PHP, which is easy to
learn and has a huge community. However, PHP has never impressed or
excited me as a language. That said, the fact that WordPress now
powers about 10% of the Web indicates that PHP is not going
away any time in the near future. Moreover, there are many
opportunities to extend, expand and work within the WordPress
ecosystem. One friend of mine has a very successful business as a
WordPress e-commerce consultant. Given the size of that ecosystem, I
expect that he will have clients and work for about as long as he
would like.
</p><p>
Depending on your development background, experience and taste, you
might want to try something like Go, Scala or Clojure, all of which
can be used for Web applications and have active, strong communities
that continue to grow.
</p><p>
The bottom line is, if you already know a programming language, you
should try to leverage that knowledge and use it to dip your toes into
Web development. If you don't already feel comfortable with a
language, I suggest trying Python or Ruby. They're easy to
learn, have large communities and ecosystems, and have multiple
frameworks that can cater to needs large and small. Of course, you
may decide to go in a different direction&mdash;and if you do, the odds
are that you'll be just fine. Learning to be a Web developer is
generally more difficult than learning to develop Web applications in
a new language or with a new framework.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a741c8"></a>
Front End</h2></div></div><p>
The whole idea of the &ldquo;front end&rdquo; in Web development has been
increasingly critical in the last decade. Whereas it was once enough
to know about HTML, and then CSS, the combination of HTML5, CSS,
JavaScript and numerous APIs has made front-end development a complex
but vital part of any Web application stack.
</p><p>
That said, don't feel that you need to understand everything at once
when working on the front end. You will need to learn some HTML, as
well as some basic CSS. And the odds are good that you will need to
learn some JavaScript as well, although just how much you will learn
depends on how much client-side work you will need to do and how
sophisticated it will need to be.
</p><p>
Perhaps the biggest boon to front-end development in the last few
years has been the creation of front-end frameworks, such as Zurb
Foundation and Twitter Bootstrap. These frameworks make it possible
to focus on the design you want, taking advantage of the fact
that others have had to struggle with the same issues before you. I
have used Bootstrap on a number of projects and have found that it
saves me time, while allowing the design to look far better than 
otherwise would have been the case. Bootstrap and Foundation don't mean
that you don't have to learn CSS, but they dramatically reduce the
amount of CSS you need in order to get a site up and running.
</p><p>
JavaScript is also enjoying a surge in popularity, partly because Web
applications are becoming more sophisticated, and partly because
everyone has a JavaScript development environment&mdash;namely a Web
browser. The number of modules and packages for JavaScript is
extraordinarily large and shows no signs of stopping. The growth of
Ember.js and Angular.js is encouraging and interesting. At the same
time, I think these front-end frameworks are too complex for
beginning programmers. jQuery, although somewhat old-fashioned, is still
a great JavaScript library that makes it easier to manipulate the DOM
in a cross-platform way.
</p><p>
JavaScript is a vital skill every Web developer should have. The
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Eloquent JavaScript</em></span>, by Marijn Haverbeke and at
<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net" target="_self">eloquentjavascript.net</a>, is a great introduction to the JavaScript
language, although it focuses on the language, rather than its use in
Web development.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x297b580.0x2a74590"></a>
So, Where Should You Start?</h2></div></div><p>
The good news is that Web development is so diverse, it's hard to
make a bad or wrong choice. Almost no matter what you choose, there
is a community using those same technologies.
</p><p>
If you're a complete newbie, I'd suggest trying Python, along
with the Flask framework, the PostgreSQL database and the Bootstrap front-end
framework along with jQuery.
</p><p>
If you feel very comfortable with object-oriented programming, or feel
like you want a bit more flexibility in your code style, you
might take a look at Ruby with the Sinatra framework&mdash;and also
PostgreSQL, Bootstrap and jQuery.
</p><p>
Finally, WordPress development is a good way to get your feet wet in
its own ecosystem. I'm not sure if I'd say that WordPress is the
paradigm of beautiful software development, but it's hard to argue
with the market share and plugin ecosystem that has grown up around
this very successful, very user-friendly system.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
It sometimes seems as if all software development is becoming Web
development. That's obviously an exaggeration, but the demand for Web
developers, and the number of interesting projects for such
developers, continues to surge. It doesn't matter very much what
language or technology you learn; the important thing is to learn the
Web mindset and try to figure out what niche of this growing
industry you want to be a part of or benefit from.
