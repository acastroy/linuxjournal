Developing packages for distributions has been entrusted to
distribution maintainers for many years. However, organizations can
support their own custom modifications to their favorite
distribution. Using methods and tools from the distribution and the
broader Open Source community, EMSL (Environmental Molecular Sciences
Laboratory) has developed a process to build,
develop and validate creation of RPMs to be included with the
Scientific Linux distribution deployed on HPC systems. This process
helps EMSL meet the HPC users' needs with rapid turnaround while
managing communication between end user and package development.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf1580.0xbe91f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Organizations supporting Linux operating systems commonly have a need
to build customized software to add or replace packages on production
systems. This need comes from timing and policy differences between
customers and the upstream distribution maintainers. In practice,
bugs and security concerns reported by customers will be prioritized
to appropriate levels for the distribution maintainers who are trying
to support all their customers. This means that customers often need
to support patches to fill the gap, especially for unique needs,
until distribution maintainers resolve the bugs. &lt;/EndSoapBox&gt;
</p><p>
Customers who desire to fill the support gap internally should
choose tools that the distribution maintainers use to build packages
whenever possible. However, third-party software packages often
present challenges to integrate them into the distribution properly.
Often these packages do not follow packaging guidelines and, as a
result, do not support all distribution configurations or procedures
for administration. These packages often require more generic
processes to resolve the improper packaging. &lt;/EndSoapBoxAgain&gt;
</p><p>
From this point on, the tools and methods discussed in this article are
specific to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). These tools and methods also
work with derivative distributions like Scientific Linux or Community
Enterprise OS (CentOS). Some of the tools do include support for
distributions based on Debian. However, specifics on implementation
of the process focus on integration with RHEL-based systems.
</p><p>
The build phase of the process (described in
&ldquo;A Process for Managing and Customizing HPC Operating Systems&rdquo; in the
April 2014 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>) requires
three pieces of software that can be filled by Trac
(<a href="http://trac.edgewall.org" target="_self">trac.edgewall.org</a>), Cobbler
(<a href="http://www.cobblerd.org" target="_self">www.cobblerd.org</a>) and Jenkins
(<a href="http://www.jenkins-ci.org" target="_self">www.jenkins-ci.org</a>). However, these pieces of
software do not fill all the gaps present from downloading source
code to creation of the overlay repository. Further tools and
processes are gained by analysis of the upstream distribution's
package management process and guidelines.
</p><p>
The application of the Fedora Packaging Guidelines
(<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines" target="_self">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines</a>) and
its counterpart EPEL Packaging Guidelines
(<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL:Packaging" target="_self">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL:Packaging</a>) are good
references for how to package software for RHEL-based
systems appropriately. These guidelines call out specifics that often
are overlooked by first-time packagers. Also, tools used in the process,
such as Mock
(<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock" target="_self">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock</a>), work well
with the software mentioned previously.
</p><p>
Fedora uses other tools to manage building packages and repositories.
These tools are very specific to Fedora packaging needs and are not
general enough for use in our organization. This is primarily due to
technical reasons and features that I go into in the Jenkins
section of the article.
</p><p>
The rest of this article focuses on implementing Trac, Cobbler,
Jenkins, and the gaps between the three systems. Some of the gaps
are filled using native plugins associated with the three systems.
However, others are left to be implemented using scripts and
processes requiring human interactions. There are points where human
interaction is required to facilitate communication between groups,
and other points are where the process is missing a well
implemented piece of software. I discuss setup, configuration
and integration of Trac, Cobbler and Jenkins, along with some
requests for community support.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf1580.0xbe9880"></a>
Trac</h2></div></div><p>
Trac consists of an issue-tracking system and wiki environment to
support software development projects. However, Trac also works well
for supporting the maintenance of administrative processes and managing
change on production systems. I'm going to discuss the mapping to apply a
software development process to the process by which one administers
a production system.
</p><p>
I realize that talking about issue tracking and wiki software is a
religious topic for some. Everyone has their favorite software, and
these two kinds of systems have more than enough open-source options
out there from which people can choose. I want to focus on the features
that we have found useful at EMSL to support our HPC system and how
we use them.
</p><p>
The ticket-tracking system works well for managing small changes on
production systems. These small changes may include individual
critical updates, configuration changes and requests from users.
The purpose of these tickets is to record relevant technical
information about the changes for administrators as well as
management. This helps all stakeholders understand the cost and
priority of the change. These small changes can be aggregated into
milestones, which correspond to outage dates. This provides a
starting framework to track what change happens and when on
production systems.
</p><p>
Trac's wiki has features that are required for the process. The first
is the ability to maintain a history of changes to individual pages.
This is ideal for storing documents and procedures. Another feature
is the ability to reference milestones from within pages. This
feature is extremely useful, since by entering a single line in the
wiki, it displays all tickets associated with the
milestone in one simple line. These two features help maintain the
procedures and outage pages in the wiki.
</p><p>
The administrative procedures are documented in the wiki, and they include
but are not limited to software configuration, startup, shutdown and
re-install. The time required to perform these
administrative procedures also should be noted in the page. We also make sure
to use the plain-text options for specifying commands that need to be
run, as other fonts may confuse readers. In many cases, we have
specified the specific command to run in these procedures. For
complex systems, creating multiple pages for a particular procedure is
prudent. However, cross links between pages should be added to note
when one part of the procedure from each page should be followed.
</p><p>
Trac's plugin infrastructure does not have plugins to Jenkins or
Cobbler. However, what would be the point of a plugin going from Trac
to continuous integration or provisioning? Most software development
models keep ticket systems limited to human interaction between
the issuer of the ticket and the people resolving it. Some exceptions are
when tickets are considered resolved but are waiting for integration
testing. Automated tests could be triggered by the ticketing system
when the ticket's state is changed. However, mapping these sorts of
features to administrative procedures for managing production systems
do not apply.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xaf1580.0xbe9bf0"></a>
Cobbler</h2></div></div><p>
Cobbler works well for synchronizing RPM-based repositories and using
those repositories to deploy systems. The RPMs are
synchronized daily from Jenkins and distribution maintainers. The
other important feature is to exclude certain packages
from being synchronized locally. These features provide
a platform to deploy systems that have specific customized packages
for use in the enterprise.
</p><p>
The initial setup for Cobbler is to copy the primary repositories for
the distribution of your choice to &ldquo;repos&rdquo; in Cobbler. The included
repositories from Scientific Linux are the base operating system,
fastbugs and security. Other distributions have similar repository
configurations (see the Repositories and Locations sidebar). The other repository
to include is EPEL, as it contains Mock and other tools used to build
RPMs. There are other repositories that individual organizations
should look into, although these four repositories are all that is
needed.

The daily repositories either are downloaded from the Web on a daily
basis or synchronized from the local filesystem. The daily
repositories get the &ldquo;keep updated&rdquo; flag set, while the test and
production repositories do not. For daily repositories that
synchronize from a local filesystem, the &ldquo;breed&rdquo; should be set to
rsync, while daily repositories that synchronize from the Web should
set their &ldquo;breed&rdquo; to yum. This configuration, through experience, has
been chosen because some RPMs do not upgrade well with new kernels
nor do they have standard update processes normal to Red Hat or
Fedora.
</p><p>
An example of a set of repositories would be as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
phi-6-x86_64-daily &mdash; synchronizes automatically from the local filesystem
using rsync once daily.
</p></li><li><p>
epel-6-x86_64-daily &mdash; synchronizes automatically from the Web using
reposync once daily.
</p></li><li><p>
phi-6-x86_64-test &mdash; synchronizes manually from phi-6-x86_64-daily using
rsync.
</p></li><li><p>
epel-6-x86_64-test &mdash; synchronizes manually from epel-6-x86_64-daily
using rsync.
</p></li><li><p>
phi-6-x86_64-prod &mdash; synchronizes manually from phi-6-x86_64-test using
rsync.
</p></li><li><p>
epel-6-x86_64-prod &mdash;
synchronizes manually from epel-6-x86_64-test using rsync.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
To exclude critical packages from the upstream distribution, the &ldquo;yum
options&rdquo; flags are set on the daily repository to remove them. For
example, to exclude the kernel package from from being synchronized,
add <tt  >exclude=kernel*</tt>. It's important for administrators to consult
both the Cobbler and yum.conf man pages to get the syntax right.
</p><p>
Setting up Cobbler in this way allows administrators to deploy
systems using customized critical packages. Cobbler also
is used in future phases where the repositories are used to deploy the
test and production clusters. The repositories and their
relationships are all Cobbler needs to support package
building, the test cluster and the production cluster.

Jenkins</h2></div></div><p>
Jenkins is a very powerful continuous integration tool used in
software development. However, from a system administration view,
Jenkins is a mutant cron job on steroids. Jenkins handles periodic
source code checkout from source code management (SCM) repositories
and downloading of released source code, via HTTP or FTP.
It then runs a series of generic jobs that build, test and deploy the
resulting software. These generic interfaces work well for building
and distributing RPMs to be included by Cobbler.
</p><p>
The use of Jenkins in a software development role is not all that
different from building RPMs (see Table 1 for a comparison of the two
processes). 
The first step in the two
processes differs in that (hopefully) the software development code
required for the build step is in one place. Package developers need
to have, at a minimum, two locations to pull code from to continue
with the build. The first location is for patches and spec files,
normally kept in an SCM. The second is for released source code
packages. Source code is released in a single file and usually in
some container format (such as tar, rar or zip). These
files do not normally belong in an SCM and are more suited to an S3
(<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html" target="_self">docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html</a>),
swift
(<a href="http://docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-object-storage/1.0/content" target="_self">docs.openstack.org/api/openstack-object-storage/1.0/content</a>)
or blob store-like interface.

Jenkins is built primarily for downloading code from one and only one
SCM. However, you can work around this issue by adding another
build step. This means that the SCM plugin is
used to download the spec file and patches while the first step in
the build process downloads the source code package. After these two
steps are done, the source code, patches or spec file can be patched
with site-specific customization.
</p><p>
The next step is to build RPMs using Mock.
This involves several tasks that can be broken up into various
build steps (see the Mock Build in Jenkins sidebar). All these steps are done
using the Jenkins execute shell build steps. Some of the Jenkins jobs
we use are multi-configuration jobs that contain one axis defining
the Mock chroot configuration. That chroot configuration should be
generated from the daily repositories defined in Cobbler. Following
these tasks can get you started on using Mock in Jenkins (Listing 1).

</p></li></ol></div></div><p>
Once the RPMs are built, it's important to run
<tt  >rpmlint</tt> on the resulting
RPMs. This output gives useful advice for how to package
RPMs properly for the targeted platform. This output should be handled like
any other static code analysis tool. The number of warnings and errors
should be tracked, counted and graphed over a series of builds. This
gives a good indication whether bugs are being resolved or introduced
over time.
</p><p>
The generated RPMs and <tt  >rpmlint</tt> output need to be archived for future
use. The archive artifacts plugin works well for capturing these
files. There also is an artifact deployer plugin that can copy the
artifacts to directories that Cobbler can be configured to
synchronize from for its part of the process.
</p><p>
There is some room for improvement in this process, and I
outline that in the conclusion. However, this is the basic framework
to start using Jenkins to build RPMs using Mock and rpmlint. This
part of the process needs constant care and attention as new updates
are pushed by the distribution and package developers. Jenkins does
have plugins to Trac and other issue-tracking systems. However, they
are not included in this process, as we find e-mail to be a sufficient
means of communication. The outlined process for building RPMs using
Jenkins helps us track the hacks we use to manipulate important
packages for our systems.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I have discussed a method for setting up tools to develop RPMs
against a custom distribution managed by Cobbler. Along with Trac,
package developers can maintain updated RPMs of critical applications
while managing communication. However, this process is not without
gaps. First, I'll go over the gaps present in Jenkins, discussing
core and plugin gaps that were not found. Then I'll discuss the gaps in Cobbler
regarding repository management. These two systems are
lacking in integration, although that can be worked around.
</p><p>
MultiSCM is a functionality in Jenkins that would simplify the package
building process. There is a MultiSCM
plugin (<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Multiple+SCMs+Plugin" target="_self">https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Multiple+SCMs+Plugin</a>);
however, it is advertised as a proof-of-concept code. The
hope is that the radio button selection for SCM would turn into a
set of check boxes. There are related bugs, but they have not seen
traction in years. Package development is another good example of the
need to download and poll for updates on code from multiple places.
</p><p>
Here are links to information on the Jenkins Multiple SCMs Bugs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-7192" target="_self">https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-7192</a>
</p></li><li><p>
<a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9720" target="_self">https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9720</a>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Static code analysis tools are available as plugins for Jenkins
(<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Violations" target="_self">https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Violations</a>),
although these plugins do not include rpmlint. These plugins create
graphs to track the number of warnings and errors in code over time. To
perform the same task for packaging would be very helpful. However,
you can work around this gap by using the generic plot plugin
(<a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plot+Plugin" target="_self">https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plot+Plugin</a>)
and another build step for each job.
</p><p>
Mock has a very well defined interface and workflow. A generic plugin
to use Mock in Jenkins would be very useful. The plugin should
include configuring the chroot configuration. Two kinds of build jobs
also could be created, one using spec and source files, the other
using source RPMs. A test also would need to be created to verify
that Mock can be run without prompting for a user password. This plugin
would be very helpful for automating this process, as we currently
have to copy scripts between jobs.
</p><p>
There are some additions to Cobbler that would be useful for
this process as well. There are no per-repo triggers. The ability to tell
Trac that packages went from repo test to repo prod would be useful.
Furthermore, the ability to tell Jenkins to build a package because
a dependent package updated also would be useful.
</p><p>
The other useful addition to Cobbler would be the ability to remove older RPMs in
the destination tree while synchronizing from the remote mirror.
Cobbler repositories, if the &ldquo;breed&rdquo; is yum, build up in an
append-only fashion. Processes for managing the space may be run
periodically by removing the RPMs and then synchronizing the
repository again. However, this leaves the repository in a broken
state until the process is complete. This feature could be useful in
any Cobbler deployment, as it would make sure repositories do not
continue to take up space when RPMs are not needed.
</p><p>
Trac does not need any additional plugins to integrate better with
Cobbler or Jenkins. We have found some usability issues with
manipulating large tables in the wiki format. Some plugin
to make editing large tables easier in the wiki format would be
useful for us. Also, editing long pages becomes an issue if you cannot put comments throughout the page. We validate our procedures by
having members of the group who are unfamiliar with the
system read through the procedure. The reader should be able to
comment on but not edit parts of the page. We have
worked around or found plugins on the Trac Hacks page
(<a href="http://www.trac-hacks.org" target="_self">www.trac-hacks.org</a>) to resolve these issues.
</p><p>
The final request is for some level of certification from
distribution maintainers to certify third-party packages. Many of the
third-party packages we have applied to this process to do not support
all distribution configurations. A certification from distribution
maintainers validating that software distributed by third-party
vendors have packaged their software appropriately for the
distribution would help customers determine the cost of support.
</p><p>
This is by no means a complete solution for organizations to build
customized critical applications. There are still gaps in the system
that we have to work around using scripts or manual intervention.
We constantly are working on the process and tools to make them
better, so any suggestions to improve it are welcome. However, these
tools do fill the need to support customization of critical
applications for HPC at EMSL.
