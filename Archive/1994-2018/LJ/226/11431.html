Don't let your fancy new tablet collect dust!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9e580.0xe96358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Like many folks, I received a shiny new Nexus 7 tablet for Christmas. This
brought me great joy and excitement as I began to plot my future
paperless life. For most of the evening and an hour or so the next day,
I was sure the new Android tablet would change my life forever. Sadly,
it wasn't that easy. This month, I want to dive head first into the
tablet lifestyle, but I'm not sure if it's really the lifestyle for me. I'll
try to keep everyone posted during the next few months (most likely in the
Upfront section of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>). And please,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>please</em></span> don't hesitate to send me messages about the ways you
find your Android tablet useful at work/home/play.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9e580.0xe96510"></a>
At Work</h2></div></div><p>
The main reason I decided on the Nexus 7 was because with the leather
case I bought for it (Figure 1), it was small enough to carry
to meetings easily, yet big enough to view full-size documents. I figured with
a tablet computer, I might be able to do away with most of the paper in
my life. I have cabinets <span   class="emphasis"><em>full</em></span> of filed papers that I never use. I do,
however, search my e-mail on a regular basis for communications sent or
received years ago. I want that same accessibility for items that
exist only in paper form now.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11431f1.large.jpg"><img src="11431f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Paperless: Evernote or Dropbox</h2></div></div><p>
I've been trying to go paperless since long before I got a tablet computer.
There seems to be two schools of thought in the paperless
department. There are the Evernote people, and there are the
&ldquo;every-other-kind&rdquo;
of people. I have Evernote on every electronic device I own (which is a
significant number), and I have to admit, for raw information, Evernote
is amazing. The problem comes with documents. Granted, documents can
be added to an Evernote note, but they are like e-mail attachments, and
they can't be modified once attached. This means, at least for me, that the
only documents I ever attach are &ldquo;complete&rdquo; documents that are printed
as PDF files.
</p><p>
I don't have a good solution for how to handle Word/LibreOffice documents
in Evernote. So, that means I have an inconvenient combination of Evernote
for unformatted information and Dropbox for documents. Thankfully,
both applications run <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> well on Android, so
although I don't have a
central repository for all my information, at least I can access all
the information from my tablet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9e580.0xe96ae8"></a>
Getting Data In</h2></div></div><p>
Evernote includes a really nice mechanism for using a device's camera
for importing digital snapshots of documents, notes, whiteboards and so
forth. Unfortunately, the Nexus 7 doesn't have a rear camera. Thankfully, my
cell phone has a really nice camera, and it also has Evernote installed.
Because
I never intended my tablet to replace my cell phone, this isn't a big
issue for me. I just whip out my phone if I need to import something
optically into Evernote.
</p><p>
My biggest hope with the Nexus 7 was that I could avoid toting around
legal pads and pens to meetings. I tend to take &ldquo;doodle&rdquo; notes, so
a laptop really isn't ideal for me at a meeting. (Plus, I tend to become
distracted with a laptop and multitask my way into trouble quite often.)
I researched capacitive styli and found the New Trent IMP62B to be
just about the best option (Figure 2). It's less than $10, and it's
remarkably precise for a stylus with a rather bulbous tip.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11431f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. This stylus is remarkably precise given the size of its tip.
</p></div></div><p>
After buying a stylus, coming up with a note-taking application proved
to be difficult. I almost can get there with a couple apps, but nothing
has been the ideal option for me. The closest I've come to perfection is
Lecture Notes, which has some critical features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Importing PDF files from Dropbox for annotation during a meeting (for
example,
an agenda).
</p></li><li><p>
Exporting directly to Evernote.
</p></li><li><p>
Very fine lines when writing.
</p></li><li><p>
Simple interface for changing pens, erasing and so on.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I'll admit, it's still not as quick as writing on paper, but for some
quick doodles on a PDF agenda, Lecture Notes does a nice job (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11431f3.large.jpg"><img src="11431f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Lecture Notes is a great application if you want to take notes
with a stylus.
</p></div></div><p>
My wife actually likes to type on her tablet (an iPad Mini) with the
onboard keyboard. If she's taking notes, she'll just open up Google
Docs and type on the screen. For me, typing on any screen is awkward and
slow. If I have to do any real typing on my tablet, I'll use a Bluetooth
keyboard. At that point, however, I might as well just use a laptop. In
a pinch, it's certainly possible to type a few notes with the on-screen
keyboard, and if you don't have a laptop, a Bluetooth keyboard will help
manage some serious typing. Still, I don't recommend it. Any Nexus-size
keyboards are too small to type well with, and any full-size Bluetooth
keyboards are cumbersome to carry around.

Printing and Viewing</h2></div></div><p>
Just a couple years ago, it was absurd to think about printing from a
phone or tablet. Now, it's easy to set up network printing for Android
devices, and Linux users easily can share printers with iOS devices
as well. So printing, interestingly enough, is fairly ubiquitous.
Figure 4 shows an example of printing from Google Drive.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11431f4.large.jpg"><img src="11431f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. My printer has native Google Print support, but it's possible to
set up a traditional printer.
</p></div></div><p>
Speaking of Google Drive, the native Google application does a decent
job of creating Microsoft-compatible Office files. The newest version of
Drive even allows editing and creating spreadsheet files! When combined
with Android's built-in file viewer, it's difficult to find a document
Android can't read. I've never been stuck in a meeting unable to view
an e-mail attachment, which would be a real showstopper for me at work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9e580.0xe977f8"></a>
Geeking It Up</h2></div></div><p>
If you're stuck wearing a tie and attending meetings all day, the above
information might be all you're interested in. For me, although I attend
more meetings than I care for, I also have the opportunity to be a geek. A
tablet computer offers some really great apps for system administrators
or just geeks on their lunch break. Here are some of my favorites:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
ConnectBot: this is the de facto standard SSH client for accessing remote
servers. As with typing long documents, the on-screen keyboard can be
frustrating for more than a few quick server tweaks, but the program
itself is awesome. If you've ever SSH'd into a server on a cell phone
screen, the 7" of real estate on the tablet will be a godsend. No geek
is complete without a command-line interface, and ConnectBot provides
remote access to one.
</p></li><li><p>
WiFi Analyzer: I've mentioned this app before in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, and
rightly so. It does exactly what's on the tin: it analyzes the Wi-Fi
networks in your area. Whether you want to find an open channel or
check signal strength in different areas of your building, WiFi Analyzer
is amazing.
</p></li><li><p>
WiFi Map Maker: I had never heard of this application, but a reader
(Roman, I won't mention his last name out of respect for his privacy)
sent me information on it. If you need to make a quick-and-easy map of
Wi-Fi hotspots, this is hard to beat. It uses the built-in GPS on your
tablet to create a thermal map of Wi-Fi coverage in real time.
</p></li><li><p>
SplashTop: now that SplashTop supports controlling Linux workstations
along with Windows and OS X, it's become a whole lot more usable for
me. Using its custom application installed on your computer, SplashTop
allows remote control of workstations with incredible responsiveness. It's
a bit like VNC simplified and on steroids. Heck, it's even possible
to play PC games over the connection! (Not that you'd ever do that
at work.)
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9e580.0xe97c70"></a>
At Home: a Boy and His Recliner&mdash;and Tablet</h2></div></div><p>
I don't think I've watched a television show or movie at my house in
the past decade without a notebook computer sitting on my lap. Whether
it's to look up an actor on IMDB or to catch up on RSS feeds during
the boring scenes, an on-line connection has become a requirement for
me in my recliner. In this case, I've found the Nexus 7 to be a decent
replacement for a full-blown laptop. Not only can I do all the things I
normally do with my laptop, but I also can use an XBMC remote application
to control the TV. If I happen across a cool on-line video, I can 
send it to my XBMC unit quickly with iMediaShare, which uses Apple's AirPlay
technology to stream video directly to the TV. It gives me a certain
level of satisfaction to stream video from an Android device to my Linux
nettop running XBMC using an Apple protocol, yet having no Apple hardware
or software in the mix. Truth be told, it works a lot more consistently
than the Apple TV and actual AirPlay does at work too. iMediaShare has
both a free and paid version, available on the Google Play store.
</p><p>
One thing I never do on my laptop is read books. Even though I can read
countless Web articles on the computer, for some reason I can't bring
myself to read actual book-length material. With the tablet on my lap
instead of a laptop, flipping open the Kindle app allows me to read
a few pages of a book if there's nothing interesting on TV. Why the
Kindle app? I'm glad you asked. As it turns out, even though it has the
absolute worst interface for finding a book in your collection, it has
some features that I find indispensable:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
With the &ldquo;Personal Documents&rdquo; feature Amazon offers, any DRM-free ebook can
be e-mailed and stored on Amazon Cloud. They can be retrieved from any
Kindle device or app (excluding the Cloud Reader, but I don't read books
on my computer screen anyway).
</p></li><li><p>
WhisperSync used to work only on Amazon-purchased materials, but now it
works on Personal Documents too. This means I can pick up my cell phone to
read a few pages at the doctor's office, and then pick up my tablet later
and automatically be right where I left off. Because this works across
platforms, it makes the Kindle reader my go-to app.
</p></li><li><p>
I keep my DRM-free e-book collection at home on Calibre. With Calibre's
export feature, sending a book to a specific Kindle device's e-mail address
is a single click away.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I really do wish Amazon would improve the browsing interface for Android
devices. I suspect Amazon is trying to push people into buying a Kindle
Fire, however, since it also won't release the Amazon Prime streaming
app. Oh well, the WhisperSync feature makes all the difference for me,
and I'm willing to suffer a cruddy interface when opening a book.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9e580.0x1290338"></a>
Pure, Down-Home Entertainment</h2></div></div><p>
The tablet size and touchscreen really does make it a perfect device for
simple gaming. Whether you want to sling <span   class="emphasis"><em>Angry Birds</em></span> at a bunch of pigs
or use the tablet like a steering wheel to drive your 4x4
across rough terrain, the Nexus 7 is awesome. I'm not much of a gamer,
but as it happens, that's exactly the type of person tablet games are
made for! If I want to play a quick game of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Solitaire</em></span> or even shoot a
couple zombies, the tablet interface is perfect.
</p><p>
Entertainment doesn't stop with games, however. I've mentioned Plex in
recent issues of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, but it bears mentioning
again. If you
have a collection of videos on your home server, Plex will transcode and
stream them to you anywhere. It works at least as well as the AirVideo
application on iOS, and the server component works excellently on a
headless Linux server. When you add Netflix, Hulu Plus, Smart Audiobook
Player, Pandora, Google Music, Amazon MP3 and the ability to store
local media, it's hard to beat the Nexus 7 for media consumption.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9e580.0x12905f8"></a>
And in between Work and Home</h2></div></div><p>
One place I never expected to use my tablet was in my car. No, I don't
read books or watch videos during the daily commute, but I certainly
enjoy listening to audiobooks. With its built-in Bluetooth connection,
I happily can stream a book through my car's audio system. I find traffic
jams much more palatable now that it means more time for
&ldquo;reading&rdquo;.
</p><p>
I've also found Google Map's ability to download maps for off-line use
to be awesome. I opted to get the Wi-Fi-only model of the Nexus 7, so
when I'm in the car, I don't have Internet connectivity. My car doesn't
have a navigation system, so the 7" screen and off-line maps make for
an incredible GPS system. Google's turn-by-turn navigation is amazing,
and the nice big screen means it's more useful than my phone's GPS. I
don't have a great way to mount the tablet in my car yet, but I suspect
with a bit of Velcro it won't be a big problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9e580.0x12907b0"></a>
Where to Go from Here?</h2></div></div><p>
I've given you a glimpse at how I use my tablet on a day-to-day basis. I
hesitated to do this though, because I don't feel I'm really using the Nexus
7 to its fullest potential. Based on a few conversations I've had with
fellow readers, however, I don't think I'm alone. I don't think tablet
computers will replace desktop or even laptops any time soon, but I do
think they have a place in our daily lives. Hopefully this article
gets you started with integrating a tablet computer into your everyday
life. I look forward to hearing about and sharing your experiences,
