Do you routinely make changes to more than a dozen machines at a time?
Read this article to find out about a tool to make that task much easier.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11c7580.0x12bf250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'll be honest. Even though this library is fully five years old, I hadn't
heard of Fabric until about six months ago. Now I can't imagine not having
it in my digital tool belt. Fabric is a Python library/tool that is
designed to use SSH to execute system administration and deployment tasks
on one or more remote machines. No more running the same task, machine by
machine, to make one change across the board. It is a simple
fire-and-forget tool that will make your life so much simpler. Not only
can you run simple tasks via SSH on multiple machines, but since you're
using Python code to execute items, you can combine it with any arbitrary
Python code to make robust, complex, <span   class="emphasis"><em>elegant</em></span> applications for deployment
or administration tasks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11c7580.0x12bf408"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Fabric requires Python 2.5 or later, the setuptools packaging/installation
library, the ssh Python library, and SSH and its dependencies. For the
most part, you won't have to worry about any of this, because Fabric can
be installed easily through various package managers. The easiest, and
most prolific way to install Fabric is using pip (or easy_install). On
most systems, you can use your systems package manager (apt-get, install,
and so on) to install it (the package either will be fabric or python-fabric).
If you're feeling froggy, you can check out the git repository
and hack away at the source code.
</p><p>
Once installed, you will have access to the <tt  >fab</tt> script from the command
line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11c7580.0x12bf5c0"></a>
Operations</h2></div></div><p>
The Fabric library is composed of nine separate operations that can be
used in conjunction to achieve your desired effect. Simply insert these
functions into your fabfile and off you go:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >get(remote_path, local_path=None)</tt> &mdash;
<tt  >get</tt> allows you to pull files from the remote machine to your local machine.
This is like using <tt  >rsync</tt> or
<tt  >scp</tt> to copy a file or files from many machines.
This is super effective for systematically collecting log files or backups
in a central location. The remote path is the path of the file on the
remote machine that you are grabbing, and the local path is the path to
which you
want to save the file on the local machine. If the local path is omitted,
Fabric assumes you are saving the file to the working directory.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >local(command, capture=False)</tt> &mdash; the local function allows you to take action on the local host in a similar
fashion to the Python subprocess module (in fact, local is a simplistic
wrapper that sits on top of the subprocess module). Simply supply the
command to run and, if needed, whether you want to capture the output. If
you specify <tt  >capture=True</tt>, the output will be returned as a string from
local, otherwise it will be output to STDOUT.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >open_shell(command=None)</tt> &mdash; this function is mostly for debugging purposes. It opens an interactive
shell on the remote end, allowing you to run any number of commands. This
is particularly helpful if you are running a series of particularly complex
commands and it doesn't seem to be working on some of your machines.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >prompt(text, key=None, default='', validate=None)</tt>
&mdash; in the case when you need to supply a value, but don't want to specify it
on the command line for whatever reason, <tt  >prompt</tt> is the ideal way to do
this. I have a fabfile I use to add/remove/check the status of software on
all of the servers I maintain, and I use this in the script for when I
forget to specify what software I'm working on. This prompt will appear
for each host you specify, so make sure you account for that!
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >put(local_path, remote_path, use_sudo=False, mirror_local_mode=False,
mode=None)</tt> &mdash; this is the opposite command of
<tt  >get</tt>, although you are given more options when
putting to a remote system than getting. The local path can be a relative
or absolute file path, or it can be an actual file object. If either
<tt  >local_path</tt> or <tt  >remote_path</tt> is left blank, the working directory will be
used. If <tt  >use_sudo=True</tt> is specified, Fabric will put the file in a
temporary location on the remote machine, then use <tt  >sudo</tt> to move it from the
temporary location to the specified location. This is particularly handy
when moving system files like /etc/resolv.conf or the like that can't be
moved by a standard user and you have root login turned off in SSH. If you
want the file mode preserved through the copy, use
<tt  >mirror_local_mode=True</tt>;
otherwise, you can set the mode using <tt  >mode</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >reboot(wait=120)</tt> &mdash;
<tt  >reboot</tt> does exactly what it says: reboots the remote machine. By default,
<tt  >reboot</tt> will wait 120 seconds before attempting to reconnect to the machine
to continue executing any following commands.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >require(*keys, **kwargs)</tt> &mdash;
<tt  >require</tt> forces the specified keys to be present in the shared environment
dict in order to continue execution. If these keys are not present, Fabric
will abort. Optionally, you can specify <tt  >used_for</tt> to indicate what the key
is used for in this particular context.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >run(command, shell=True, pty=True, combine_stderr=True, quiet=False,
warn_only=False, stdout=None, stderr=None)</tt> &mdash;
This and sudo are the two most used functions in Fabric, because they
actually execute commands on the remote host (which is the whole point of
Fabric). With <tt  >run</tt>, you execute the specified command as the given user.
<tt  >run</tt> returns the output from the command as a string
that can be checked
for a failed, succeeded and return_code attribute.
<tt  >shell</tt> controls whether
a shell interpreter is created for the command. If turned off, characters
will not be escaped automatically in the command. Passing
<tt  >pty=False</tt> causes
a psuedo-terminal not to be created while executing this command; this can
have some benefit if the command you are running has issues interacting
with the psuedo-terminal, but otherwise, it will be created by default. If
you want stderr from the command to be parsable separately from stdout, use
<tt  >combine_stderr=False</tt> to indicate that.
<tt  >quiet=True</tt> will cause the command to
run silently, sending no output to the screen while executing. When an
error occurs in Fabric, typically the script will abort and indicate as
such. You can indicate that Fabric need not abort if a particular command
errors using the <tt  >warn_only</tt> argument. Finally, you can redirect
where the remote stderr and stdout redirect to on the local side. For
instance, if you want the stderr to pipe to stdout on the local end, you
could indicate that with <tt  >stderr=sys.stdout</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >sudo(command, shell=True, pty=True, combine_stderr=True, user=None,
quiet=False, warn_only=False, stdout=None, stderr=None,
group=None)</tt> &mdash;
<tt  >sudo</tt> works precisely like <tt  >run</tt>, except that it will elevate privileges prior
to executing the command. It basically works the same is if you'd run the
command using <tt  >run</tt>, but prepended
<tt  >sudo</tt> to the front of command.
<tt  >sudo</tt> also
takes user and group arguments, allowing you to specify which user or group
to run the command as. As long as the original user has the permissions to
escalate for that particular user/group and command, you are good to
go.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11c7580.0x12c0ab8"></a>
The Basics</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you understand the groundwork of Fabric, you can start putting
it to use. For this article, I explain how to make a
simple fabfile for the purpose of installing/removing software and your
machines. First, you need what is called a fabfile. The fabfile
contains all of your Fabric functions. By default, it needs to be named
fabfile.py and be in the working directory, but as mentioned previously, you can
specify the fabfile from the command line if need be. So, open your fabfile
and start it with <tt  >from fabric.api import *</tt> to include all the Fabric
functionality. Then define all of your functions. Let's start with installing
some software:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def install(pkg=None):
   if pkg is not None:
      env["pkg"] = pkg
   elif pkg is None and env.get("pkg") is None:
      env["pkg"] = prompt("Which package? ")
   sudo('yum install -y %s' % env["pkg"])
</pre>
</p><p>
You then can install a package via <tt  >yum</tt> on all of your machines by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ fab --hosts=host1,host2,host3 install
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you'll be prompted for the package to install only once.
Alternatively, since you indicated an optional parameter of
<tt  >pkg</tt>, you can
indicate that from the command line so you won't be prompted on execution,
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ fab --hosts=host1,host2,host3 install:pkg=wormux
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11c7580.0x12b7710"></a></h2></div></div><p>
or:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ fab --hosts=host1,host2,host3 install:wormux
</pre>
</p><p>
Also note that you are prompted for the password for both SSH
and sudo only once. Fabric stores this in memory and reuses it, if possible,
for every other machine. Congratulations! You've just successfully
created your first Fabric script. It's as simple as that!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11c7580.0x12b78c8"></a>
Tips and Tricks</h2></div></div><p>
I've picked up some neat tricks since I've started with Fabric.
First, you generally never see a Fabric command as simple as what is
above. When fully automated, it looks more like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ fab --skip-bad-hosts -u user -p 12345 -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa --warn-only
 &#8618;--hosts=host1,host2,host3,host4,host5,host6,host7,host8,host9,host10
 &#8618;--parallel --pool-size=20 install:pkg=wormux
</pre>
</p><p>
Who wants to type that out every time they want to run a command? No one!
That's why aliasing almost all of that is so convenient and
efficient. Add
the following to your .bashrc file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
alias f="fab --skip-bad-hosts -u user -p 12345 -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa
 &#8618;--warn-only
 &#8618;--hosts=host1,host2,host3,host4,host5,host6,host7,host8,host9,host10
 &#8618;--parallel"
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, all you have to do each time you want to run Fabric is this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ f install:pkg=wormux
</pre>
</p><p>
Even using this technique, your alias can become cumbersome if you have
more than a few machines you commonly administer. A simple solution to
that is to add this function to your fabfile:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def set_hosts():
   env.hosts = open('hosts', 'r').readlines()
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, put all your hostnames in a file called hosts in the same directory
as your fabfile, and modify your alias to look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
alias f="fab --skip-bad-hosts -u user -p 12345 -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa
 &#8618;--warn-only --parallel set_hosts"
</pre>
</p><p>
This is particularly convenient if you have a variety of fabfiles that you
use on different groups of machines, or in different contexts.
</p><p>
There are occasions when you need to execute certain commands from
within a specific directory. Because each command is a discrete and
non-persistent connection to the machine, this is not inherently simple.
However, simply by enclosing the necessary commands in a
<tt  >with</tt> statement, you
have a solution:

<pre     class="programlisting">
with cd("~/gitrepo"):
   run('git add --all')
   run('git commit -m "My super awesome automated 
   &#8618;commit script for `date`"')
</pre>

More Information</h2></div></div><p>
There are several ways to get help with Fabric. The most effective is to
use the fab-file mailing list
(<a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/fab-user" target="_self">lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/fab-user</a>). The developers are
generally very prompt in responding. There is also a Fabric Twitter
account @pyfabric (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/pyfabric" target="_self">www.twitter.com/pyfabric</a>) where Fabric news and
announcements are released. You can submit and view bugs through the
Fabric Github page (<a href="https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues" target="_self">https://github.com/fabric/fabric/issues</a>). Of
course, you also can't discount the #fabric channel on Freenode, where you can
connect with the community and get some quick answers. Finally, you 
always can browse the documentation hosted at <a href="http://www.fabfile.org" target="_self">www.fabfile.org</a>.

A Brief Word on Application Deployment</b></p><p>
Fabric also is used in development teams to deploy new code to production.
It is actually used in a fairly similar fashion to how system
administrators use it (copy files, run a few commands and so on), just in a very
specific manner. Because of how automated Fabric is, it's easy to
incorporate it into a continuous integration cycle and even fully automate
your deployment process.

Command-Line Arguments</b></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >-a</tt>, <tt  >--no_agent</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.no_agent</tt> to True, forcing your SSH layer not to talk to the SSH
agent when trying to unlock private key files.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-A</tt>, <tt  >--forward-agent</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.forward_agent</tt> to True, enabling agent forwarding.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--abort-on-prompts</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.abort_on_prompts</tt> to True, forcing Fabric to abort whenever it
would prompt for input.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-c RCFILE</tt>, <tt  >--config=RCFILE</tt>
&mdash; sets <tt  >env.rcfile</tt> to the given file path, which Fabric will try to load
on startup and use to update environment variables.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-d COMMAND</tt>, <tt  >--display=COMMAND</tt>
&mdash; prints the entire docstring for the given task, if there is one. It does
not currently print out the task's function signature, so descriptive
docstrings are a good idea. (They're always a good idea, of course, just
more so here.)
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--connection-attempts=M</tt>, <tt  >-n M</tt>
&mdash; sets the number of times to attempt connections. Sets
<tt  >env.connection_attempts</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-D</tt>, <tt  >--disable-known-hosts</tt>
&mdash; sets <tt  >env.disable_known_hosts</tt> to True, preventing Fabric from loading
the user's SSH known_hosts file.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-f FABFILE</tt>, <tt  >--fabfile=FABFILE</tt>
&mdash; the fabfile name pattern to search for (defaults to fabfile.py), or
alternately an explicit file path to load as the fabfile (for example,
/path/to/my/fabfile.py).
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-F LIST_FORMAT</tt>,
<tt  >--list-format=LIST_FORMAT</tt> &mdash; 
allows control over the output format of <tt  >--list</tt>.
<tt  >short</tt> is equivalent to
<tt  >--shortlist</tt>; <tt  >normal</tt> is the same as simply omitting this option entirely
(the default), and <tt  >nested</tt> prints out a nested namespace tree.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-g HOST</tt>, <tt  >--gateway=HOST</tt>
&mdash; sets <tt  >env.gateway</tt> to HOST host string.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-h</tt>, <tt  >--help</tt> &mdash;
displays a standard help message with all possible options and a brief
overview of what they do, then exits.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--hide=LEVELS</tt> &mdash;
a comma-separated list of output levels to hide by default.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-H HOSTS</tt>, <tt  >--hosts=HOSTS</tt>
&mdash; sets <tt  >env.hosts</tt> to the given comma-delimited list of host strings.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-x HOSTS</tt>,
<tt  >--exclude-hosts=HOSTS</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.exclude_hosts</tt> to the given comma-delimited list of host
strings to keep out of the final host list.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-i KEY_FILENAME</tt> &mdash;
when set to a file path, will load the given file as an SSH identity
file (usually a private key). This option may be repeated multiple times.
Sets (or appends to) <tt  >env.key_filename</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-I</tt>, <tt  >--initial-password-prompt</tt>
&mdash; forces a password prompt at the start of the session (after fabfile
load and option parsing, but before executing any tasks) in order to
pre-fill <tt  >env.password</tt>. This is useful for fire-and-forget runs (especially parallel sessions,
in which runtime input is not possible) when setting the password via
<tt  >--password</tt> or by setting
<tt  >env.password</tt> in your fabfile is undesirable.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-k</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.no_keys</tt> to True, forcing the SSH layer not to look for SSH
private key files in one's home directory.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--keepalive=KEEPALIVE</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.keepalive</tt> to the given (integer) value, specifying an SSH
keepalive interval.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--linewise</tt> &mdash;
forces output to be buffered line by line instead of byte by byte.
Often useful or required for parallel execution.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-l</tt>, <tt  >--list</tt> &mdash;
imports a fabfile as normal, but then prints a list of all discovered
tasks and exits. Will also print the first line of each task's docstring,
if it has one, next to it (truncating if necessary).
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-p PASSWORD</tt>,
<tt  >--password=PASSWORD</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.password</tt> to the given string; it then will be used as the
default password when making SSH connections or calling the sudo program.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-P</tt>, <tt  >--parallel</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.parallel</tt> to True, causing tasks to run in parallel.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--no-pty</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.always_use_pty</tt> to False, causing all run/sudo calls to behave
as if one had specified <tt  >pty=False</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-r</tt>, <tt  >--reject-unknown-hosts</tt>
&mdash;
sets <tt  >env.reject_unknown_hosts</tt> to True, causing Fabric to abort when
connecting to hosts not found in the user's SSH known_hosts file.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-R ROLES</tt>, <tt  >--roles=ROLES</tt>
&mdash;
sets <tt  >env.roles</tt> to the given comma-separated list of role names.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--set KEY=VALUE,...</tt> &mdash;
allows you to set default values for arbitrary Fabric env vars. Values
set this way have a low precedence. They will not override more specific
env vars that also are specified on the command line.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-s SHELL</tt>, <tt  >--shell=SHELL</tt>
&mdash; sets <tt  >env.shell</tt> to the given string, overriding the default shell
wrapper used to execute remote commands.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--shortlist</tt> &mdash;
similar to <tt  >--list</tt>, but without any embellishment&mdash;just task names
separated by newlines with no indentation or docstrings.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--show=LEVELS</tt> &mdash;
a comma-separated list of output levels to be added to those that are
shown by default.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--ssh-config-path</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.ssh_config_path</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--skip-bad-hosts</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.skip_bad_hosts</tt>, causing Fabric to skip unavailable hosts.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >--timeout=N</tt>, <tt  >-t N</tt> &mdash;
set connection timeout in seconds. Sets <tt  >env.timeout</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-u USER</tt>, <tt  >--user=USER</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.user</tt> to the given string; it then will be used as the default
user name when making SSH connections.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-V</tt>, <tt  >--version</tt> &mdash;
displays Fabric's version number, then exits.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-w</tt>, <tt  >--warn-only</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.warn_only</tt> to True, causing Fabric to continue execution even
when commands encounter error conditions.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >-z</tt>, <tt  >--pool-size</tt> &mdash;
sets <tt  >env.pool_size</tt>, which specifies how many processes to run
concurrently during parallel execution.
