Continuing our development of a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span> game, this month Dave tackles
the tricky task of sorting a hand by rank value.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a7f580.0x2b77408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
We're been working on writing code for the game
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span>, and last month, I
ended this column by creating the code needed to pick a random subset of six cards
out of a &ldquo;deck&rdquo; and display them in an attractive
format&mdash;like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh cribbage.sh
Card 0: 7C
Card 1: 5H
Card 2: 9H
Card 3: 10S
Card 4: 5D
Card 5: AS
</pre>
</p><p>
The primary task on the agenda this month is to sort the cards after
they've been dealt. This means we're going to have to sort
the cards by rank while ignoring the suit, then slot them back into
the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; array. Is there an easy way to do that? Actually,
we'll use the
<tt  >sort</tt>
function.
</p><p>
We can prototype this by using the command line to see what result we get:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh cribbage.sh  | sort -n
Card 0: 4S
Card 1: 7C
Card 2: 9S
Card 3: JC
Card 4: 7H
Card 5: 8C
</pre>
</p><p>
What the heck? Oh! You can see the problem, right? By telling
<tt  >sort</tt>
to order things numerically, it properly ignores &ldquo;Card&rdquo; but then
sees the ordinal value of the card and sorts based on that, rather than
on the actual card value itself.
</p><p>
Even if we fix this, however, we still have the problem that face cards
will sort before numeric value cards, which isn't what we want. In
fact, we want aces to sort as lower than 2s, while jacks, queens and
kings sort as higher than 10s.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>If you wanted to have aces &ldquo;high&rdquo;, the easiest way to do that would
be to change the display routine, of course: 1 = a deuce, 2 = a three,
12 = king and 13 = ace. Poof. Everything sorts ace-high. That's just
not how <span class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span> scores them.</em></span>
</p><p>
To accomplish <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span>-rank sorting, we'll need to change the output
to push out two values: the rank and the total card value. It's going
to look ugly, but it's just an interim result.
</p><p>
Here's how I tweak the code to display these values:


<pre     class="programlisting">
showcard()
{
  # given a card value of 0..51 show the suit and rank
  suit=$(( $1 / 13 ))
  rank=$(( ( $1 % 13 ) + 1 ))
  case $rank in
    1)  orank="A" ;;
    11) orank="J" ;;
    12) orank="Q" ;;
    13) orank="K" ;;
     *) orank=$rank ;;
  esac
  showcardvalue=$orank${suits[$suit]}
}
</pre>
</p><p>
If you compare it to the version we built last month, the main difference
is that instead of calculating the rank of the card and then overwriting
it with &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;J&rdquo;, &ldquo;Q&rdquo; or
&ldquo;K&rdquo; as appropriate, we're
using a new variable, <tt  >orank</tt>, to store the corrected value. Why? Because
now in the main section of the script we also can access the $rank of
the card as desired:

<pre     class="programlisting">
showcard ${hand[$card]}
echo "$rank ${hand[$card]}"
</pre>
</p><p>
For each card chosen, the script has an interim output of rank followed
by the numeric value of the card, with no fancy display (even though
we're still tapping the showcard function for simplicity). The result:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh cribbage.sh
13 38
6 31
8 33
10 35
5 30
12 24
</pre>
</p><p>
Ugly? Definitely. But now we can sort it and get useful results, even
if they might not look like it quite yet:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh cribbage.sh | sort -n
1 26
2 14
2 40
3 2
7 45
10 22
</pre>
</p><p>
It still looks confusing, but you can see that it's in rank order.
</p><p>
So, how do we get that back into the &ldquo;hand&rdquo; array now that we know how to
sort it? That's actually rather tricky because of variable scoping
issues, as you'll see.
</p><p>
Before we go there, however, I've written a new &ldquo;showhand&rdquo; function
that displays all the cards in the hand on a single line, with the help
of /bin/echo for echoes without a trailing line break:

<pre     class="programlisting">
showhand()
{
   # show our hand neatly
   /bin/echo -n "Hand: "
   for card in {0..4}
   do
     showcard ${hand[$card]}
     /bin/echo -n "$showcardvalue, "
   done
   showcard ${hand[5]}
   echo "$showcardvalue."
}
</pre>
</p><p>
With that available, our main code starts to look nice and clean:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dealhand;
showhand;  # for testing sorthand only
sorthand;
showhand;
</pre>
</p><p>
For debugging purposes, I'm going to display the hand before and after
we've sorted by rank. Eventually, the first &ldquo;showhand&rdquo; would just
be axed, of course.
</p><p>
Now, let's get back to the code needed to sort the cards in our hand
(a feature that a lot of iOS <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span> games seem to omit, as far as I
can tell).
</p><p>
My first stab at writing &ldquo;sorthand&rdquo; took advantage of a very slick
feature in Bourne shell that lets you tie the output of one loop to the
input of another with a pipe. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for card in {0..5}
do
  showcard ${hand[$card]}
  echo "$rank ${hand[$card]}"
done | sort -n | while read rank value
do
  hand[$index]=$value
  index=$(( $index + 1 ))
done
</pre>
</p><p>
The problem is that the shell's pipe implementation pushes the second loop
into a subshell without any easy way to get the changed values back up
to the parent shell. The result: by the line immediately after the last
<tt  >done</tt> statement, all the new values have been lost.
</p><p>
That's too bad, because it definitely was more elegant. But then again, it's not
about elegant, it's about functional, right?
</p><p>
Here's how I actually solved it, by using a temporary file to store
the intermediate results instead. It's considerably less elegant, for sure:

<pre     class="programlisting">

sorthand()
{
   # hand is dealt, now sort it by card rank...
   index=0
   tempfile="/tmp/.deleteme"
   for card in {0..5}
   do
     showcard ${hand[$card]}
     echo "$rank ${hand[$card]}"
   done | sort -n &gt; $tempfile
 
   while read rank value
   do
     hand[$index]=$value
     index=$(( $index + 1 ))
   done &lt; $tempfile
   rm -f $tempfile
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Note that to get the input of the temporary file as the input for the
<tt  >while</tt> loop, I simply redirect stdin for the loop at
the very <span   class="emphasis"><em>end</em></span>
of the loop: <tt  >done &lt; $tempfile</tt>.
</p><p>
Let's test it by dealing a few hands and then showing them immediately
post-deal and then after they've been rearranged with the sorthand
function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh cribbage.sh
Hand: 9H, 6D, KC, AH, 9S, JH.
Hand: AH, 6D, 9S, 9H, JH, KC.
$ sh cribbage.sh
Hand: 4D, QS, AC, 9H, 10C, JS.
Hand: AC, 4D, 9H, 10C, JS, QS.
$ sh cribbage.sh
Hand: 9H, 10C, 7C, 7H, 5H, AS.
Hand: AS, 5H, 7C, 7H, 9H, 10C.
</pre>
</p><p>
It looks like it's working exactly as we'd hope. Yeee-ha!
</p><p>
Yes, there are undoubtedly more efficient ways to write this code and
you can quite reasonably ask if a shell script is the optimal development
environment for this sort of project, but, seriously, lighten up. Let's
enjoy this project, not flagellate ourselves over punctuation!
</p><p>
And on that note, let's wrap up this month's column and start thinking
about a considerably harder challenge we'll face starting next month:
how to evaluate the <span   class="emphasis"><em>value</em></span> of the hand so that we can recommend which
four of the six cards dealt should be kept to optimize the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span> hand.
</p><p>
You are learning <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cribbage</em></span> as we go, right? You'll want it for next
month's installment, for sure.
