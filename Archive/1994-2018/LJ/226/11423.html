<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #226, February 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>udev</b></span> project appears to be in crisis.
<span   class="bold"><b>Kay Sievers</b></span> has come under fire
for failing to fix problems that have cropped up in the system, and it
looks as though top kernel folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Al
Viro</b></span>, not to mention <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span>, have been calling for someone else to take over the project.
</p><p>
The main issue is that user systems have been hanging. According to Kay,
this is partly due to udev having a mysterious slowdown that he hasn't been
able to fix yet. The slowdown results in certain driver requests being
delayed until they time out, which apparently cause the appearance of a
crash.
</p><p>
But Kay feels that the real problem is with the kernel's behavior, not with
udev, and that the main kernel code should deal with it. Al and Linus (and
the rest of the people complaining) argue that udev previously had been
working, and that it was a patch to udev that resulted in the system
crashes; therefore, udev either needed to fix the issue or revert
the patch.
</p><p>
This hearkens back to the days when kernel folks blamed <span   class="bold"><b>GCC</b></span> for producing
bad machine code, while the GCC folks blamed the kernel for using bad C
code. One key difference is that unlike GCC, the udev code is actually
part of the kernel and isn't an independent project.
</p><p>
It seems clear that if Kay can't fix the problem, or at least adopt better
development practices, someone else will be asked to maintain udev.
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span>, one of the original udev authors, would be an obvious
candidate, at least for the short term. But, he's pretty busy these days doing
tons of other kernel work.
</p><p>
Recently, Linus Torvalds decided to simplify the <span   class="bold"><b>cryptographic signature
code</b></span> for kernel modules. His initial motivation was to speed things up by
migrating some of the time-consuming signing issues from compile time to
install time where they would end up being faster.
</p><p>
This turned out to be slightly controversial. <span   class="bold"><b>David
Howells</b></span> suggested that
Linus should go even further and take out all the module-signing code and
just let users do it manually. But, this ended up causing some unexpected
blowback from Linus.
</p><p>
The issue Linus is concerned with is the ordinary user who wants to protect
the system from root kits and other attacks. Requiring modules to be signed
by a secure key is a good way to address that. But, he felt that David was
concerned with allowing distribution vendors to keep a cryptographic
stranglehold over what kind of software ordinary users could run on their
systems.
</p><p>
There was a brief attempt recently to change the way
<span   class="bold"><b>&ldquo;signed-off-by&rdquo;
reviews</b></span> are submitted. Typically, whenever a patch gets sent into the
kernel, it passes through a gauntlet of reviewers who confirm that the
patch looks good, contains no proprietary code and so on. But, Al Viro
pointed out that in a lot of cases, reviews show up in the mailing list,
after the patch already has been accepted into the kernel. In that case,
the sign-off doesn't get included. Al felt this was lost data, and he
suggested changing the process, so that sign-offs could be added
after the fact.
</p><p>
There actually was quite a bit of support for this idea, and it turned out
that the latest versions of <span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> already support it, via the <tt  >git
notes add</tt>
command. But, although Linus Torvalds is fine with people using that sort
of thing for local development, he said he wouldn't include after-the-fact
sign-offs in the main tree. He just felt it wasn't that important. As long
as someone signs off on the code, especially the author of the given patch,
he's fine with not having the maximum number of sign-offs that he could
get.
</p><p>
Considering that the signed-off-by process was created in direct response
to the <span   class="bold"><b>SCO lawsuits</b></span>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO%E2%80%93Linux_controversies" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO%E2%80%93Linux_controversies</a>), he must be
pretty confident that it's not an important issue. I believe at the time
Linus was particularly inconvenienced, having to account for the origins
and licenses of many kernel patches.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Plex</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #226, February 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Anyone with an iPhone probably is familiar with the AirVideo
application. Basically, it's the combination of a server app that runs on
your Windows or OS X machine, and it serves video over the network to an
AirVideo application on your phone. It's extremely popular, and for a
good reason&mdash;it works amazingly well.

</p><p>
For a long time, there wasn't a good solution for the Android world,
largely due to the way Android streamed video. Now, however, there is an
incredible application for doing the exact same thing iOS users do with
AirVideo. You've probably heard of Plex, but you may not know about the
server/client combination it can do with Android.
</p><p>
Once you install the server application, which runs perfectly fine on a
Linux server, you install the Plex application from the Google Play store,
and your video collection follows you anywhere you have connectivity. The
content is, of course, dependent on the content you have on your server,
but the format in which your content is stored doesn't matter very much.
Plex's server application does a great job of streaming most video
formats and converting to an appropriate bandwidth on the fly.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11423androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11423androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Plex shows your home video collection in much the same way as Hulu or

Figure 2. The video quality adjusts for your current bandwidth and
renders crisp video even on a large tablet display.
</p></div></div><p>
Plex may have started out as a Macintosh-compatible competitor to XBMC,
but it's evolved into an incredible video-streaming system. With Plex,
you can become your own Netflix! Due to its Linux compatibility and
incredible video streaming ability, Plex is this month's Editors' Choice!

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Dive Deep with Wireshark</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #226, February 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Before you say anything, yes, I know Wireshark is available
for Linux. This time, however, Windows and OS X users get to play
too. Wireshark is an open-source network analyzation tool that is really
an amazing tool for troubleshooting a network.
</p><p>
Running Wireshark on OS X does require an X11 server (see my
Non-Linux FOSS article in the December 2012 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> on XQuartz.) It also looks a
bit dated once it's up and running, but rest assured, the latest version
is functioning behind the scenes. If you're thinking this program looks
a lot like Ethereal, you're absolutely correct. It's the same program,
but six or so years ago the name changed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11423fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11423fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Wireshark is strictly a wired-ethernet inspection tool, but if you're
trying to solve a network issue, it's the de facto standard tool. It's
not a new tool by any means, but if you're on a foreign operating
system (that is, not Linux), it's nice to know some old standbys are
available. Check it out today at <a href="http://www.wireshark.org" target="_self">www.wireshark.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">System Administration Poll</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="authorgroup"><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Katherine Druckman</h3></div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #226, February 2013</div></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
System Administration is one of the most popular topics at
LinuxJournal.com, and many of our readers have loads of experience in
the field. We recently polled our on-line readers about their system
administration habits, and we received some interesting answers, as usual.
</p><p>
We were surprised to learn that an almost equal number of you use a GUI
or Web-based tool versus the command line, with 51% using the latter. And,
on the command line, your preferred protocol is SSH by a wide margin with
87%. Telnet and remote serial console each received 6%, with 1% of you
using something else entirely. 45% of you manage one server, while 15%
manage more than 20, and more than a few of you are employed by hosting
companies or companies with similar needs, so those numbers get pretty high.
</p><p>
We were not all that surprised to learn that vim was your favorite
command-line text editor by far, with 74% of the votes, compared to nano/pico
with 14% and emacs with 8%. The remaining 4% of you use something else,
and among the other options was naturally &ldquo;all of the above&rdquo;.
</p><p>
61% of you are mostly running Ubuntu or Debian-based servers, and Red
Hat is your second favorite (24%), while 7% are running Windows. The
other 8% of you are running a variety of other operating systems including
other flavors of Linux, Solaris, AIX or FreeBSD.
</p><p>
Security updates are a regular and necessary process, and 43% of you do
them at least annually, while 12% apply security updates daily. We're
relieved to know so many of you are on top of things. Non-security
updates are also frequent with the majority or readers updating at
least quarterly.
</p><p>
The full survey results are below for your perusal, and thanks again

<h2 class="title">Handling R Packages</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #226, February 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One of the R statistics program's great features is its modular nature. As
people develop new functionality, R is designed so that it's relatively
easy to package up the new functionality and share it with other R users.
In fact, there is an entire repository of such packages, offering
all sorts of goodies for your statistical needs. In this article, I look
at how to find out what libraries already are installed, how to install new
ones and how to keep them up to date. Then, I finish with a quick look at
how to create your own.
</p><p>
The first step is to take a look and see what libraries already
are installed on your system (Figure 1). You can do this by running
<tt  >library()</tt>
from within R. This provides a list of all the libraries installed
in the various locations visible to R. If you find the library 
you're interested in, your work is almost done. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11423rlibsf1.large.jpg"><img src="11423rlibsf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The <tt >library()</tt> command gives a list of currently
installed libraries.
</p></div></div><p>
In order to make R 
load the library of interest into your workspace, you need to call
<tt  >library</tt> with the name of the library in the brackets. Let's say
you want to do parallel code with the multicore library. You
would call <tt  >library("multicore")</tt>. 
</p><p>
If you want to learn more about
a library, R includes a help system that is modeled after the man
page system used in Linux. 
There are two ways to access it. The
first is to use the <tt  >help()</tt> command. So in this case, you would run
<tt  >help("multicore")</tt> (Figure 2). The shortest way to get help is to use the
special character <tt  >?</tt>. For example, you could type
<tt  >?multicore</tt> to get the same
result. 
A related command that is good to know is <tt  >??</tt>. It does a search
through the library names and descriptions based on the text given. For
example, <tt  >??plot</tt> pulls up entries related to the word plot
(Figure 3).

Figure 3. Looking for Help on Plots
</p></div></div><p>
But, what if the library you are interested in isn't already on your
system? Then you need to install it somehow. Luckily, R has
a full package management system built in. Installing a package is
as easy as running <tt  >install.packages()</tt>, where you hand in a list of
package names. But, how do you know what packages are available for installation? The
R project has a full repository of packages ready for you to use. You
can find them at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org" target="_self">cran.r-project.org</a>. On the left-hand menu, you
will see an entry called &ldquo;Packages&rdquo;, which will bring you to list of
packages. You can search alphabetically by name or by category.
</p><p>
Say you're interested in doing linear programming. On CRAN, you will
find a package called linprog, which you can install with the
command <tt  >install.packages("linprog")</tt>. When you first run this command,
it should come back with an error (Figure 4). By default, R tries to
install packages into the system library location. But, unless you are
running as root (and you aren't doing that, right?), you won't have
the proper permissions to do so. Therefore, R will ask if you want to
install the new package into a personal library storage location in your
home directory. After you agree to this, it will go ahead and try to
download the source for this package. If this is the first time you have
installed a package, R will ask you to select a CRAN mirror for downloading the
package.
This mirror will be used for all future downloads. By default,
R also will download and install any dependencies the requested package
needs. So in this sense, it really is a proper package management system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11423rlibsf4.large.jpg"><img src="11423rlibsf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Trying to install a library in the system location won't work.
</p></div></div><p>
For many packages, all that is involved is strictly R code. But in
some cases, the author may have written part of the code in some other
language, like C or FORTRAN, and wrapped it in R code. In those types
of packages, the other code needs to be compiled into binary code
before it can be used. How can you do that? Well, the R package system
actually can handle compiling external code as part of the installation
process. In some cases, this external code may need other third-party
libraries in order to be compiled. To hand in locations for
those, you need to add some options to the <tt  >install.packages</tt>
function call. Checking the help page (with
<tt  >?install.packages</tt>) shows that you can include installation options as <tt  >INSTALL_opts</tt>. 
</p><p>
Now
that you have your collection of packages all installed and configured
on your system, what do you do if a bug gets fixed in one of them? Or,
what happens if a new version comes out with a better algorithm? Well,
R's package management system can handle this rather
well. You can check to see whether any packages need to be updated by
running <tt  >packageStatus()</tt> (Figure 5). If you see that updates
are available, you can install the updates by using the command
<tt  >update.packages()</tt>. This command goes through each available
update and asks you whether you want to install the new version.

Many packages include either demos, data files or both. The demos
walk you through some examples of how to use the functions provided by
the package in question. To see what demos are available, you can call
<tt  >demo()</tt> (Figure 6). To run a particular demo, for example the nlm demo,
you would run <tt  >demo(nlm)</tt>.

</p></div></div><p>
Many packages also include sample data files
that you can use when you are learning to use the new functions. To see
what data files are available, you would call <tt  >data()</tt> (Figure 7). To load
a particular data file, you need to call data with the data file
you are interested in. For example, if you want to play with water
levels in Lake Huron, you would call <tt  >data(LakeHuron)</tt>. You can get
more information on the data, including a description and a list of the
variables available, by running <tt  >?LakeHuron</tt> (Figure 8).

So far, I've been looking
at dealing with individual packages, but sometimes
you need functions provided by several different packages. In R
parlance, this is called task views. These are groups of
packages that are all useful for a particular area of research. If you
are interested in using task views, start by installing
the ctv package. In R, run <tt  >install.packages("ctv")</tt> to install the
main task view package. 
</p><p>
Once that's done, you can load the library
with <tt  >library("ctv")</tt>. Now, you will have new functions included in
the install and update packages. To install a view, like the
Graphics view, you simply can run <tt  >install.views("Graphics")</tt>. You can
update these views as a whole with the command <tt  >update.views()</tt>. These
task views, like all of the packages, are written and maintained by other
users like yourself. So, if you have some area of research that isn't
being served right now, you can step in and organize a new view yourself.
</p><p>
Up to this point, I've been discussing how to use packages that have
been written and provided by other people. But, if you are doing
original research, you may end up developing totally new techniques and
algorithms. Science and knowledge advance when we share with others,
so R tries to make it easy to create your own packages and share them with
others through CRAN. There is a fixed directory layout where you can put
all of your code. You also need to include a file called &ldquo;DESCRIPTION&rdquo;,
and a writeup of your package. An example of this file looks like:


<pre     class="programlisting">

Package: pkgname Version: 0.5-1 Date: 2011-01-01 Title: My first package
Author@R: c(person("Joe", "Developer", email = "me@dot.com"),
            person("A.", "User", role="ctb", email="you@dot.com"))
Author: Joe Developer &lt;me@dot.com&gt;, with contributions from A.
            User &lt;you@dot.com&gt;
Maintainer: Joe Developer &lt;me@dot.com&gt; Depends: R (&gt;= 1.8.0), nlme
Suggests: MASS Description: A short (one paragraph) description License:
GPL (&gt;= 2) URL: http://www.r-project.org, http://www.somesite.com
BugReports: http://bugtracker.com

</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have all of your code and data files written and packaged,
you can go ahead and run a check on your new package by running the
command <tt  >R CMD check /path/to/package</tt> on the command line. This 
runs through some standard checks to make sure everything is where
R expects things. Once your package passes the checks, you can run
<tt  >R CMD build /path/to/package</tt> to see if R can build your package
properly. This is especially important if you have external code in
another programming language. Once your package passes the checks and
builds correctly, you can bundle it up as a tarball and send it up to
<a href="ftp://CRAN.R-project.org/incoming" target="_self">CRAN.R-project.org/incoming</a> as anonymous, and then send an e-mail
to <a href="mailto:CRAN@R-project.org">CRAN@R-project.org</a>. Once your package has been checked by someone at
CRAN to verify that it builds correctly, your newly created package will
be added to the repository. Fame and fortune will be soon to follow.
</p><p>
Hopefully this article has provided enough information to help you get
even more work done in R. And remember, we all progress when we share,
so don't hesitate to add to the functionality available to
the whole community.

<h2 class="title">It's Getting Steamy in Here!</h2>

After months of me promising Steam would be coming to Linux, the public
beta is finally here. The early verdict: it's pretty great! The
installer is a simple pre-packaged .deb file for Ubuntu (or Xubuntu
in my case), and the user portion of the install looks very much like
Windows or Macintosh. In my limited testing, I've found
the Steam beta to be at least as stable as Desura. I also was impressed
with the large number of my Steam games that have Linux versions ready
to download and play.

If you were under the impression that Steam was going to be the next
Duke Nukem Forever, I'm happy to say that you (and I) were wrong. Steam is
finally coming to Linux, which has the potential to change the way Linux
users play games. It also means fewer reboots into Windows just to shoot
a few zombies! Check it out at <a href="http://www.steamforlinux.com" target="_self">www.steamforlinux.com</a>.
