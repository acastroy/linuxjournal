vision is cynical or genuine, are able to exercise a tremendous
influence over our society. They have convinced us that broken
software is to be expected, and a fix will be out soon; that a new
computer every few years is necessary; and that children need to
use computers practically from infancy. And their influence is not
limited to consumer-users. Because of the conventional wisdom that
&ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; is responsible for the current economic boom, they
also have a strong influence on political, educational and legal
figures, for example, selling the notion that copyright of software
is a special legal form requiring special criminal provisions not
previously needed, or pushing for the adoption of multimedia-based
educational tools of uncertain educational value.</p><p>It is therefore becoming increasingly important to
consciously debate and consciously control the effect of computing
on culture. Fortunately, there is a growing literature of computer
contrarian books that argue against the conventional wisdom of
computer software design and deployment. The literature I am
writing of is not about software engineering, but rather the
purposes to which software is put and the way it is developed for
human use. Still, it is amazing that none of these books are
written by the key open-source players. Perhaps the open-source
activists are too busy building the tools of the revolution to
worry about how those tools are being used.</p><p>Two recent examples of computer contrarian books are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>High Tech Heretic</em></span> by Clifford Stoll and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>In the Beginning Was the Command Line</em></span> by Neal
Stephenson. These are notable because they were both written by
experienced authors who love and are experienced in computing, and
whose previous successes in techno-book writing has made them
somewhat famous among members of the hacker community. Both authors
set out to challenge dominant ideas in our current culture of
computing, using dramatic images and emotional rhetoric rather than
through a data-driven discussion.</p><p>In <span   class="emphasis"><em>High Tech Heretic</em></span>, Stoll argues
against the whole notion of ubiquitous computing, against the idea
that computers not only can but should cause fundamental changes in
the way we do everything. The misguided deployment of computers and
Internet connections in schools earn his special ire, as these
technologies may displace other important and effective educational
practices, and they certainly displace a significant budget that
might be better spent on teachers. Stoll writes by telling stories,
creating visions of creative, messy, hands-on education being
displaced by sterile virtual busywork. Each of his stories is
designed to invoke a headshake of empathy&mdash;the tale of the small
boy whose imperfect, but unique and original paper model is ignored
by adults who are agog over a child-created display of clipart. The
overall result is compelling.</p><p>The reader is left seriously wondering whether all these
invasions of computing make sense. Is computing, especially the
simple use of computer software, really more important than art in
developing a growing intellect? Is word processing honestly an
academic subject worth serious school time? Does Powerpoint really
make a boring talk less dull? Does it even make an interesting talk
better? Stoll strives for an apparently simple, common-sense view,
so that his readers will consider the broad issue, even if they
disagree with his particulars.</p></div></div>
