    This company converted to a Linux server for its Oracle

product we produce is data. Pace Analytical is in the environmental
testing industry, meaning that our clients bring us air, water and
soil samples and ask us to test them for pollutants. What we give
back to the client is a report, both electronic and hard copy, that
tells them the type and concentrations of compounds discovered in
the samples.
</p><p>The mission-critical application for our company is our
Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). This system's
primary goal is to provide fast, accurate and timely information to
our clients; it is based on an Oracle relational database. The LIMS
handles everything, from sample check-in to invoicing, by modeling
the laboratory operations. LIMS eliminates redundant processes and
data entry, and allows for greater standardization in areas such as
quality-control batches, data reporting and billing throughout the
system.</p><p>One aspect of our Y2K program was updating the LIMS to be
Y2K-compliant. This meant upgrading from 7.0.16 of Oracle RDBMS to
7.3.4, converting all the Oracle Forms 3.0 code to version 4.5 and
converting C code to handle dates correctly. The real work in this
project turned out to be not the Y2K issues, but rather the
conversion of all the Oracle Forms code to work in the new version
of the Oracle Forms tool.</p><p>Another issue we were facing at the same time as the Y2K
development was response time and throughput on our LIMS servers.
Over time, additional load on the systems occurred because of a
larger number of users and because multiple instances of the
database were running on the same server. At the time, Pace
Analytical had three servers, and all were HP-UX boxes: one
HP9000-H70, one HP9000-I70 and one HP9000-K200, and all had been in
use for well over three years. We were running old hardware, and
our demand was exceeding its capacity to deliver.</p><p>We looked at our options for getting improved response from
the hardware. We had already addressed everything we could, given
the existing configuration, such as disk striping. One major
bottleneck was that the entire SCSI channel was limited to a total
20MB/sec throughput. One option was to add a faster channel. HP had
a card that would talk to a SCSI sub-system (RAID), but prices
seemed quite high, even on the used market; the best quote we could
find was about $10,000 US. Another option was to add more cards to
get more 20MB/sec channels. After a close analysis, it became clear
that, in addition to the SCSI channel, the hardware was also
limited by the CPU and RAM.</p><p>Another option discussed was to purchase new HP-UX servers.
This represented a sizable investment&mdash;well over six figures for
three servers. About this time, the Pace Analytical database
administrator, Michael Lester, came up with an alternative
proposal. He proposed purchasing Intel-based hardware
(PC-compatible) and running Oracle 8 on Linux, using Oracle SQL*Net
to communicate between the current HP-UX server and the Linux
database server. What Michael proposed made sense for a number of
reasons. First, if we could move to an Intel-based hardware
platform, it would be easier and cheaper to upgrade hardware as
demands exceeded the hardware capacity. Intel-based hardware is
much cheaper, and is readily available locally in case problems are
encountered with components. As hardware is upgraded, an old server
can be put to service as a Windows-based desktop system, but the
old HP hardware is of no use to us.</p><p>The new hardware uses SCSI Ultra2, also a wide format, and
each channel has an 80MB/sec throughput. Because of the low cost,
we could afford to put in four channels: one for the OS and archive
drives, one for the slower tape and CD drives and two for the
database. The six drives for the database are configured for RAID
and are split&mdash;three drives on each of the two database channels.
In this configuration, the maximum throughput for the database
drives would be around 160MB/sec, an eightfold speed increase over
the old hardware. The CPUs are 600MHz dual Pentium III processors.
In benchmarking, this turns out to be only about two times faster
than the HP RISC processor on the old hardware.</p><p>The total cost of one server, including 512MB RAM, was about
$10,000. We were able to build a brand-new server with eight times
the throughput on the SCSI channel and twice the processor speed
for the same cost as upgrading the SCSI subsystem on the existing
server. We had conservatively estimated a five to tenfold
improvement in performance over the old hardware. The true test,
though, is always how a system performs in a live production
environment. We were not disappointed. Several report programs
that, on the old hardware, would run in the background for 45 to 80
minutes now finish in six minutes or less. One lab supervisor
literally ran into the IS area and asked, &ldquo;What's going on with
the LIMS? It is <span   class="emphasis"><em>flying</em></span>!&rdquo;</p><p>The project was not as simple as just building a Linux
server. As I mentioned in the beginning, the original plan was to
upgrade to Oracle version 7.3.4 on the HP hardware. In order to run
Oracle on the Linux OS, we were forced to go to version 8 of the
Oracle database. There were no real issues installing Oracle 8 on
Linux, with the exception of a minor patch that had to be installed
to get it recompiled. The main problem we found with Oracle8 was a
newer &ldquo;rowid&rdquo; concept it used.</p><p>The software conversion to Oracle*Forms 4.5 had to happen
regardless of the hardware platform, since version 3 was no longer
supported by version 7.3 and later of the database. We opted to use
a character-based version of the Oracle*Forms 4.5. To switch to an
event-based GUI interface would have meant a wholesale
restructuring of the 100+ Forms programs. At first, most of the
problems were syntax errors, things that were valid in Forms
Version 3 but no longer legal in the new Forms version. A few
naming conventions changed, and we happened to have used names for
objects (fields/triggers/variables) which where not allowed under
the new Forms. Then came problems with &ldquo;integrating&rdquo; all of the
forms back into the LIMS product. For example, many of the Forms
check to see which form/menu called them, and thus operate in a
different mode. The function to return the calling name returned it
in lower case under Version 3, and upper case in Version 4.5, so
the IF statement failed. We added the
<b  >lower(xxxxx)</b> function to force it to lower case.
Also, there are a number of forms that get called from others as
pop-ups, and many of the screen layouts were messed up.</p><p>We also encountered problems with the HP character mode
terminal emulation, which caused the Oracle/HP resource file to
become corrupted. Eventually, we had to switch to VT220 emulation,
and ran into some issues with the terminal emulation. The VT220
terminals had a strange kind of &ldquo;screen&rdquo; memory. Two text screens
could be displayed, and a user switched between these by sending
codes to the screen. The terminal emulator added a vertical scroll
bar, making it possible to scroll back to see what was previously
on the screen. This kept messing up scroll regions on the screen,
which is what vi and Oracle use to show you a pop-up window. The
emulator vendor, Minisoft
(<a href="http://www.minisoft.com" target="_self">http://www.minisoft.com/</a>),
was very responsive and corrected the incompatibilities we
encountered using their VT220 product.</p><p>An additional software complication is that a number of the
functions in the Forms code are actually Pro-C routines called from
inside the Forms session, known as &ldquo;User Exits&rdquo;. These functions
were written specifically to run on HP-UX. Because of the
complexity of deciphering, converting and testing the User Exits,
and the immovable nature of the January 1 deadline, Michael
proposed maintaining the HP-UX server to act as a client-side
server for the Forms programs and to have it communicate to the
database using Oracle SQL*Net. Our ultimate goal is to eliminate
the user exits and have them written in native SQL and to convert
the character-based interface to a GUI interface. This will make it
possible to run three-tiered client-server on all Linux servers,
eliminating our aging HP-UX hardware.</p><p>I have already discussed one measure of success of the
project, the dramatic improvement of the speed of the system.
Another measure that must be considered is up time. For people who
question whether Linux should be used in a mission-critical
application, our project is proof that Linux is up to the task. We
installed the first server in August of 1999 and the other two
followed one month apart, so one server has been running for five
months, one for four months and one for three months. In those
twelve months of operation, we have had absolutely no down time due
to the Linux operating system. Several issues occurred with the
Oracle database configuration, but that is not unexpected in any
new installation. We also had an issue with a network interface
card on one of the servers, but we replaced it with a
Linux-supported card and the issue has not resurfaced.</p><p>While rereading this article, it occurred to me that there
has been very little mention of Linux. In reality, that has been
the case. The true measure of an effective and robust operating
system is that it should be fairly transparent to the operation,
and that has certainly been true in our application. Without the
option of moving to a Linux operating system, our options were
either to spend five times as much on new RISC systems, or limp
along with much less than optimum performance at a cost equal to
what we ended up spending for state-of-the-art hardware. In the
case of this project, Linux was the lynchpin around which
everything else was built, and it has performed beautifully.</p></div></div>
