A look at some tools to help you easily create and maintain your
web site.
</em></span>
      </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x16673f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>I run a small consulting business in
Michigan, and one of the services I provide to my clients is web
site creation. I had been using my Windows machine for this work,
but was not satisfied with the tools I was using. They lacked
flexibility, and I had occasional lockups and other problems. Since
I used Linux for all my day-to-day tasks (browsing, e-mail, etc.),
I searched for Linux tools to do my web design work.</p><p>I wanted tools for editing HTML, updating client web sites
easily and keeping track of revisions. I tried to select programs
that had GPL or BSD licenses or an equivalent. Also, I wanted tools
with flexibility, preferring to use several instead of one monster
tool that tried to do everything. Finally, I wanted tools that
would compile and run on my SuSE 6.1 system without requiring me to
run GNOME or KDE.</p><p>I found a number of tools, and have been using them for a
month now on several client sites: some I imported from my Windows
environment and some I created under Linux. The tools available
under Linux turned out very capable and easy to use; I was quickly
able to be productive using them. Right now, the only thing I
cannot do under Linux is use my scanner, but I expect that to
change shortly. [All you need is a scanner with Linux support and
the program <span   class="bold"><b>xvscan</b></span>.
&mdash;Editor]</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x1667608"></a>HTML Editors</h2></div></div><p>I prefer to use non-WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)
editors for the bulk of my HTML work, so I have been using Bluefish
and August. While both of these editors are not up to version 1.0
yet (Bluefish is at 0.3.5 and August is at 0.52 beta), I have found
that they run reliably and work well.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3945f1.large.jpg"><img src="3945f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Bluefish Editor
</p></div></div><p>Both of these editors allow you to work on multiple files at
the same time. They both provide buttons to insert basic HTML tags
such as headings, lists and text attributes. Bluefish uses a tabbed
menu, which allows more tag selections via pushbuttons (see Figure
1) while August has a single push-button menu and uses drop-down
menus for selecting other functions (see Figure 2). This makes for
a cleaner interface and quicker selection of basic HTML tags. Both
of these editors let you preview web pages using Netscape, and
August also allows you to preview your page using Lynx.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3945f2.large.jpg"><img src="3945f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. August Editor
</p></div></div><p>Bluefish allows you to group your pages in project files. The
next time you want to edit them, all you have to do is open the
project from the Project menu. Bluefish also offers basic wizards
for such things as creating new pages and tables.</p><p>August does not provide a project menu, but you can open all
the HTML pages in a directory using a command-line switch when you
start it. August also allows you to create templates and your own
tag combinations accessible via the user menu. I found the
user-defined tag feature to have a few problems.</p><p>Bluefish requires the GTK libraries to compile. You also need
the imlib libraries for the &ldquo;Insert Picture&rdquo; functions to work.
August is a Tcl/Tk program and therefore does not have to be
compiled.</p><p>Despite being pre-1.0 versions, both of these editors have
worked well for me. I prefer Bluefish so far, but not for any
specific reason.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x1667c38"></a>Remote Site Maintenance</h2></div></div><p>Keeping remote web sites up to date manually can be a chore.
Fortunately, there are tools that help automate this process. The
two tools I have been comparing are
<span   class="bold"><b>weex</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>sitecopy</b></span>. weex is currently at
version 2.3.0, and sitecopy is at version 0.9.5.</p><p>To use them, first create a .rc file that contains site
information such as the remote server
(ftp.<span   class="emphasis"><em>here</em></span>.com), your username, password,
source (local) directory and the remote directory to update. When
the programs are run, they compare the contents of the local
directory to the remote directory, then try to make the remote
directory match the local directory.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>weex</b></span> offers very precise
control over the files and directories that can be updated or
deleted. For example, you can tell it to ignore specific
directories on the local file system and other directories on the
remote file system. You can provide it with a list of file names to
ignore or use wild cards. When a file is ignored, it is not copied
or deleted.</p><p>While <span   class="bold"><b>sitecopy</b></span>'s file
control is not as precise, it offers some features that weex does
not. For example, sitecopy can determine whether a file needs
updating by checking its timestamp or calculating its MD5 checksum.
This is handy if a file's timestamp changes, because you checked it
out of a revision control system.</p><p>sitecopy can also notify you if someone has changed files on
the remote site after you have uploaded them. When this &ldquo;Safe
Mode&rdquo; is active, sitecopy stores the modification time from the
server when you upload a file. The next time sitecopy is run, it
compares that stored time to the current modification time on the
server. If the times do not match, sitecopy displays a warning
message and will not overwrite the remote copy, allowing you to see
what changes have been made. I have not tried this function
yet.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3945f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. weex Console Output
</p></div></div><p>The console output of weex is more colorful and provides a
bit more detail than that of sitecopy (see Figures 3 and 4). The
weex command interface is also simpler: all you do is issue the
weex command followed by the name of the site you wish to update.
To run sitecopy, you issue the sitecopy command, followed by the
action you wish to take (update, fetch, synchronize), followed by
the site you wish to use. If you do not include an action command,
sitecopy displays the files that are different between the local
and remote directories.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3945f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. sitecopy Console Output
</p></div></div><p>I have found the best way to use these tools is to create the
directory structure on the remote machine before running them. It
is also best to make a complete backup of your remote directory
before running either of these programs, so you do not accidentally
erase important administration or cgi-bin files.</p><p>sitecopy provides a <b  >nodelete</b> option that
prevents it from deleting files on the remote file system, and weex
offers a <b  >test</b> option that does something
similar. I recommend you use these options the first few times you
run the programs.</p><p>While I prefer the simpler command line and more colorful
console output of weex, it does not always keep track of the files
it uploads to subdirectories on the remote site. Consequently, it
uploads some files again and again, even though they have not
changed. It also seems to have problems when the remote system is
running Windows NT, but after a bit of tweaking, I have gotten it
to work.</p><p>sitecopy runs into a problem if it tries to create a
directory that already exists on the remote machine. If the remote
directory exists, sitecopy quits with an error message. Running
sitecopy in <b  >fetch</b> mode before
<b  >update</b> mode takes care of this.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3945f5.large.jpg"><img src="3945f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. WXftp Main Window
</p></div></div><p>For copying files manually or creating the initial remote
directory structure, I use <span   class="bold"><b>WXftp</b></span>.
This program provides a graphical front end to the
<span   class="bold"><b>ftp</b></span> command (see Figure 5). It
also stores user information for sites, so you do not have to enter
addresses, usernames and passwords manually (see Figure 6). You can
also configure it to switch to specific local and remote
directories for each site you maintain. In addition to copying
files, you can create and remove directories, delete files and
execute commands on the remote system. I have been using version
0.4.4 and had no problems with it.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3945f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x1668b58"></a>Decreasing Drudgery</h2></div></div><p>Creating and maintaining HTML code can be a difficult and
boring task. Updating things such as menus and e-mail addresses by
hand on several pages for multiple sites can lead to mistakes. I
found a program called GTML that helps ease this task. GTML is a
pre-processor for HTML files. To use it, create your page with a
.gtml extension that contains GTML commands along with HTML. When
you are done, you run the .gtml file through the GTML program and
it creates a file with an .html extension for you.</p><p>GTML allows you to do simple things such as include text
files in your HTML files, and complex things such as conditional
processing. It even supports embedded Perl code or system
commands.</p><p>I frequently use GTML's <b  >#include</b> directive
to keep from typing contact or title blocks repeatedly on my pages.
Also, if I have to change something like a contact e-mail address
for a site, all I need to do is make the change in one text file
and then re-run GTML over the site's .gtml pages instead of making
the change in each .html file.</p><p>I have used the GTML conditional operators (if, elseif, else)
to build side bar menus automatically. Each page is uniquely
identified using the <b  >#define</b> command (e.g.,
<b  >#define THIS_PAGE=home</b>). I then create a text
file that contains the GTML and HTML code for the menu. This code
checks the page identifier, then determines which buttons are
active and which button corresponds to the current page. The active
buttons are generated as links to other pages, while the current
page's button either does nothing or is highlighted. Then, I
include this file in all the site's pages and run them through the
GTML program. Now adding or removing menu buttons for a site is a
simple matter of changing one text file and re-running GTML.</p><p>You can also define values to GTML in the command line. For
example, you could call GTML with the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gtml-DMY_EMAIL=me@
</pre><p>and all occurrences of <b  >MY_EMAIL</b> will be
replaced with
<b  >me@<i><tt>somewhere</tt></i>.com</b> in
the resulting .html files. This makes it easy to generate things
such as contact or copyright information for different sites using
a single template.
</p><p>According to its documentation, GTML can automatically
generate Next, Previous, Up and Down links between related pages,
as well as a table of contents. I have not used this feature
yet.</p><p>I have been using GTML version 3.5.3 and have had no problems
with it. Its command syntax is simple and straightforward. One
thing to note is that GTML commands must be flush with the left
margin in your files; otherwise, the pre-processor will not execute
them and they will show up in your HTML files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x165f9c0"></a>Clean HTML Code</h2></div></div><p>Once I am done creating my web pages, I run them through the
<span   class="bold"><b>weblint</b></span> program, which checks the
syntax of HTML documents and flags errors in much the same way
<span   class="bold"><b>lint</b></span> works on C programs.
<span   class="bold"><b>weblint</b></span> can check local files or
files stored on the Web using Lynx. By default, weblint checks HTML
code against the HTML 3.2 standard. The program also has flags to
tell it to check HTML against Microsoft- and Netscape-specific
extensions.</p><p>I have been using weblint version 1.020 without any problems.
From what I've seen on the weblint web site, it appears that
development of weblint may be halted at this time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x165fc28"></a>Graphics</h2></div></div><p>For doing graphics work, I chose the GIMP. Since I am not a
graphic artist, I frequently use the Script-Fu extensions to create
required graphics, then tweak them as necessary. Script-Fu
extensions make short work of creating page headers and sidebar
menus.</p><p>One feature I wish the GIMP offered is the ability to see how
different factors (palette size, interlacing and JPEG quality)
affect the resulting file size before saving the file. Perhaps
there is a way to do something similar in the GIMP; if so, I have
not found it yet.</p><p>I have been using version 1.0.4 of the GIMP and am completely
satisfied with it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x165fde0"></a>Miscellaneous Tools</h2></div></div><p>There are a few other tools I use which I have not mentioned.
For revision control, I use CVS. I am finally somewhat comfortable
using it, although I found it a bit difficult to understand at
first. While the accompanying manual explains the CVS commands
well, I think it could use more examples. I have been using version
1.10 of CVS.</p><p>For working on the text files used in conjunction with GTML
or for simple HTML editing, I use the
<span   class="bold"><b>vim</b></span> editor. The recent versions
provide nice syntax highlighting and make it easy to do quick
editing. I am currently using vim/gvim version 5.6.</p><p>Another program I use occasionally is called
<span   class="bold"><b>linefeed</b></span>, a little GTK utility
that converts DOS/Windows text files to Linux/UNIX ones. The
version I have been using is 0.1.0.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x156f580.0x1660048"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>A month ago, I started looking for Linux tools that would
allow me to create and manage web sites. My goals were to find
open-source tools I could compile and use without too much
difficulty. The tools I found and used have met my needs quite
well. Even though several of them are not up to version 1.0, I find
the Linux tools work better than the tools I had been using in the
Windows world. I was also able to sample a much greater variety of
Linux tools than I would have been able to in the Windows
world.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Ralph Krause (rkrause@netperson.net) made the
