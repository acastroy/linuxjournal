Linux community as one of the best getting-started books for Linux.
It explains everything you need to understand, install and use the
Linux operating system. It includes a comprehensive installation
tutorial, complete information on system maintenance, tools for
document development and programming, and guidelines for network,
file, printer and web site administration.</p><p>I received complimentary copies of the first and second
editions. However, this new third edition surpasses all the old
ones in terms of the topics covered and the extent to which it
explains the material. It features several new topics such as KDE,
Samba and PPP, as well as revised instructions for installation and
configuration, particularly the Red Hat and SuSE
distributions.</p><p>The book's first three chapters are a gentle, very
well-organised introduction that covers the history of Linux, its
system and software features. It then goes into the preparations
involved in installing Linux, such as hardware requirements,
different kinds of distributions and post-installation
procedures.</p><p>In Chapter 4, readers are introduced to the basics of UNIX
commands and concepts. These cover logging in, setting a password,
virtual consoles, popular commands and shells. Then it moves into
file name expansion, manual pages, file ownership and permissions,
processes, startup files and the directory structure.</p><p>Chapter 5 goes into system management issues such as booting
and running the system, the /proc file system and managing user
accounts. Managing file systems, swap space and devices are covered
in Chapter 6.</p><p>Earlier editions of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> served
as central guides on installing, configuring and using the OS. A
discussion of upgrading the software and the kernel starts in
Chapter 7. It covers archive and compression utilities, using RPM,
building a new kernel, loadable device drivers and loading modules
automatically. I found this part very technical, concise and to the
point.</p><p>Chapter 8 covers administrative tasks used in maintaining the
system such as making backups, scheduling jobs using
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>, managing system logs,
managing the print services, setting terminal attributes and what
action to take in an emergency situation.</p><p>Chapter 9 is the Editors and Text Tools niche. It shows users
how to edit files with vi and Emacs and how to print documents and
use different graphics programs.</p><p>It's not until Chapter 10 that the authors cover installation
and configuration of the X Window System. This chapter covers X
concepts, its hardware requirements and how to overcome some of the
problems you may encounter when you install it. A natural followup
to Chapter 10 is &ldquo;Customizing the X Environment&rdquo; in Chapter 11.
This includes the basics of X customization, the FVWM window
manager, the K desktop environment and X applications.</p><p>Chapter 12 discusses Windows compatibility and Samba, with a
lot of details on sharing files and programs.</p><p>Chapters 13 and 14 cover programming languages and the tools
used by programmers. It includes
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> (the C/C++ compiler),
Makefiles, Perl, shell scripts, Tcl/Tk,
<span   class="bold"><b>gdb</b></span> (the debugger), profilers and
other programming tools.</p><p>In Chapter 15, the authors explain networking with TCP/IP and
PPP (dial-up PPP and PPP over ISDN). It shows you how to set up
your machine to connect to a network or to an ISP. It also covers
NFS and NIS configuration. This section is particularly clear and
readable.</p><p>The last chapter is about the World Wide Web and electronic
mail and shows how to configure e-mail, set up the Elm and Netscape
mail readers and even how to run your own web server.</p><p>The book comes with eight appendices. These are of a good
value, since they cover where to get more information on Linux, the
GNOME Project and installing Linux on different platforms. In
addition to that, there is a whole appendix on LILO boot options,
which I found very useful, and another one on Zmodem File
Transfer.</p><p>The book's style is informative, clean and to the point. The
language is concise and easy to read. There are several
well-crafted sections, such as rebuilding the kernel and
configuring network links and servers.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> is a great introduction to
the world of Linux. Some people go further than that in considering
it the Linux Bible. I believe it is a good reference and by far the
best &ldquo;introduction to Linux&rdquo; book. The only drawback I could
think of is the missing Linux CD-ROM. If it came with a Linux
distribution, this would make it the most complete package for
first-time users.</p><p>All said, I would definitely recommend this text to beginners
and intermediate users. It will be a good addition to your Linux
library.</p></div></div>
