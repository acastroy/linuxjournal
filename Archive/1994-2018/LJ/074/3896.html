of years. Graphics tools are the domain of the desktop user and, as
such, have been slower in coming from both the open-source and
corporate worlds than networking and server-side tools.
Fortunately, this is a trend that's starting to change. The
importance of Linux on the desktop was recognized by video-card
companies with the advent of video games from Loki and high-end
tools like Houdini from Side Effects Software. But there is much
more to graphics on the Linux desktop than games, 3-D modelers and
renderers.
</p><p>One company that recognized early on the importance of Linux
for graphics users is Photodex, a software development company
focusing on graphics and digital-content management. Photodex,
located in the heart of Texas' high-tech mecca, Austin, started
porting work for their CompuPic product in early 1999, with a first
public beta release in June of that year. Recently I was able to
sit down with a registered version of CompuPic 4.6 to find out just
what this product can do.</p><p>CompuPic is an X Window System-based digital-content
management tool, which in layman's terms means it's designed to
assist users in keeping track of graphical images, animations and
sound files on disks and networks. Although tools like this are
most useful to web developers and graphic artists, the average
Linux user will also find significant value in products of this
nature. Available for Windows, Macintosh and Solaris, CompuPic is
currently available for only Intel x86 Linux, although support for
Alpha and PowerPC users may be available in the future.</p><p>Once started, CompuPic opens a four-part window. The top part
contains a traditional text menu system with an icon-based toolbar
directly underneath. Below these are the Folder List and File List
regions. Below the Folder List is a Preview Window. The Folder List
looks and behaves much like File Explorer from Windows. The list
starts from the root directory (i.e., &ldquo;/&rdquo;) and each directory is
given a file folder icon in either the open or closed form. Opening
a directory by clicking on it once will show all files and
subdirectories inside.</p><p>The File List is a list of individual image, sound and
animation files. This list can take a number of forms, from simple
thumbnail/file name combinations to complex thumbnail, file name,
type and size listings. These variations, along with multiple sort
options, make finding files rather simple. What's truly interesting
is that, although designed specifically for image, sound and
animation files, the file lists and sorting options work with any
file type. CompuPic is a powerful file management system no matter
what type of files you happen to be working with.</p><p>CompuPic works extensively with thumbnails. The File List
window has a number of user-configurable sizes for its listings.
The Preview window also shows a thumbnail of full-size images,
providing a more detailed view of the image file (if it is an image
file, otherwise nothing is shown in the preview). Double-clicking
on an entry in the File List window, or clicking once on the
Preview, will give a full-screen display of the image. User
preferences allow you to set the scaling used for the full-screen
display. It's also possible to select multiple files from the File
List.</p><p>Two important features of CompuPic, Slide Show and MaxiShow,
make use of the full-screen display to show one or more selected
images. The Slide Show will display images in the order selected
from the File List, putting a user-configured delay between images.
The MaxiShow is similar, except it can display multiple rows and
columns of images, also with a user-configured delay. While in
full-screen mode, you can get a menu of image-management options by
moving the mouse to the top of the screen. Options include a small
set of image manipulation tools (blur, sharpen, brighten, darken),
image transforms (rotate, scale and so forth) and a few special
features like adding balloon comments to images.</p><p>While playing with the MaxiShow feature, I discovered one of
the most interesting features about CompuPic&mdash;it actually makes use
of the <b  >PAUSE</b> key. I've never seen an application
use that key, after 20+ years of software development and computer
use. Even more interesting, it actually causes the application to
pause. You can use this incredibly intuitive (but fairly
unexpected) feature to stop and restart a slide show.</p><p>CompuPic is full of very useful features. Unless you work for
print publications, the film industry or somewhere else in the
graphic arts industry, you might not think there are many things to
do with graphic images. One handy feature is the quick picture
indices, where a set of images is placed as thumbnails on a single
page for printing. These are generally referred to as contact
sheets by those in the business, but who cares what you call them?
How incredibly handy it would be to have printed indices of your
on-line photos from this year's family trip to Lake
Whatchamacallit! You can then use another feature&mdash;e-mailing images
and indices&mdash;to send the contact sheet to family members and let
them pick the images they want. No more getting ten copies of
entire rolls of film just so you can send a duplicate to everyone
of that one picture of Uncle Ernie falling into the lake. If
everyone likes it, Uncle Ernie's fame can live on in an electronic
greeting card, which you format and e-mail right from
CompuPic.</p><p>A recent addition to the beta and public releases of CompuPic
are contracts with various on-line photo communities. Photodex
includes options for connecting to four such communities:
PhotoLoft.com, ofoto.com, PhotoIsland.com and PhotoPoint.com. The
connection is weak&mdash;CompuPic will attempt to connect to the web
site (a function that failed to do anything more than open a
Netscape window on my box), but there didn't seem to be any way to
do the uploads directly from CompuPic. In any case, each community
offers limited web storage for your images, options for making
greeting cards from those images and formatting the images into
personal photo albums. Some of the sites also offer related
articles, such as digital camera and scanner reviews. The value of
such on-line sites is, of course, purely subjective.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a79580.0x2b71ce8"></a>Good Design, But Stability Beckons</h2></div></div><p>CompuPic is well-designed in a number of ways. First, the
database of images is kept in a private directory in the user's
home directory. This means users need not worry about making
unwanted changes to an image directory on a web server. The
database is relatively small, even for large images or a large
number of them. Another good design is the interface&mdash;it's quite
intuitive. Once you're familiar with the basic layout, it's easy to
find more features. Changing file names, for example, required only
clicking on the file name of the selected entry in the File List,
then typing right over the old name.</p><p>Photodex offers some application-specific security within
CompuPic by allowing users to provide user IDs and passwords for a
given copy of the program. However, such protection isn't that
helpful, since the actual files are still potentially accessible
using normal Linux file access privileges. Photodex recommends
proper file-system administration for true file security.</p><p>One design feature which deserves special recognition is the
terrific Help system. It's a hyperlink-based system that includes
plenty of images to accompany a fairly thorough and well-indexed
text. The Help system is complete enough to make using CompuPic
possible without printed documentation&mdash;something I can't say is
true for many commercial applications.</p><p>Although the overall design and feature set is quite good,
CompuPic has a number of problems. A minor one is how it requires
you to be connected to the Internet in order to e-mail an image,
even if you're e-mailing it to a user on the local system. I don't
know why this is, but trying to send an image to myself without
being connected to the Internet failed. The test was to send the
mail to my local user ID without specifying a domain name. This
should have been routed locally, which is what my normal Sendmail
configuration does.</p><p>However, this is a modest problem. CompuPic has much larger
problems&mdash;stability, for example. I ran CompuPic on two systems: a
desktop box running Red Hat 5.2 with 256MB memory and the Xi
Graphics Accelerated-X X server, and an IBM ThinkPad 1410 with 32MB
memory and an XFree86 X server. I had numerous crashes on both
boxes, although it was worse on the laptop. Photodex states the
program had not been tested with Xi's X server. There were a few
display problems with this server in the File List window&mdash;menus
posted over this region were not always cleared completely. This
didn't happen with the XFree86 server. Display problems were minor.
The biggest problem was crashing.</p><p>On the laptop, I couldn't change directories in the Folder
List without the program crashing unless I tried compacting the
database first, and that let me change directories only once. This
problem never showed up on the desktop system. Both systems had
problems with rendering multi-line text in the Greeting Card
feature, and the laptop version wasn't happy with changing virtual
terminals. Upon returning to the X session, I had to hit the
<b  >ENTER</b> key to get CompuPic to respond. If I
didn't do this, I couldn't do anything in the X session&mdash;CompuPic
had taken keyboard and mouse focus to wait for that one key press.
Photodex had most of these problems listed on their bug-tracking
web page. One bug listed on that page was a crash at startup on Red
Hat 5.2 systems. It appears there may be some stability problems
for CompuPic when run on glibc 2.0 systems.</p><p>Other annoying issues include the About and Print options
doing nothing. I wasn't able to print anything. I suspect this
feature wasn't complete in the version I had (Version 5.0 Build
1032), which is still a beta release. The Help text, while an
extremely useful feature, assumes a Windows or Mac platform in some
places. This is an extremely minor issue, but attention to detail
is what separates good programs from great ones.</p><p>Although the Help system talks about support for scanners and
digital cameras, the associated menu option is missing in the Linux
version. This is something PhotoDex will want to look into, as it's
become a big issue for many Linux users.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a79580.0x2b720b0"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>CompuPic is offered in a free version to end users, while
corporations need to register their copies. Red Hat was suitably
impressed&mdash;they will be including the product with their next
release. Regular users can download a copy from
<a href="http://linux.compupic.photodex.com" target="_self">http://linux.compupic.photodex.com/</a>.</p><p>As I told Jason Cohen at Photodex, I found the longer I used
CompuPic, the stronger my love/hate relationship with it became. It
has many very useful features, whether you are a home hobbyist or a
professional photographer, and upcoming features, such as the
macro-recording feature, will make it even more impressive. But the
beta versions have many problems. Stability is an important issue
that needs to be addressed. Crashes abound, though never were the
images or any other files corrupted. Still, despite the numerous
crashes, I found I could perform quite a bit of work with CompuPic.
That's a pretty good start for PhotoDex.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a79580.0x2b72268"></a>The Goods</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Well-designed</p></li><li><p>Good feature set</p></li><li><p>Quick picture indices</p></li><li><p>Ability to e-mail images and images</p></li><li><p>On-line photo communities</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a79580.0x2b726e0"></a>The Bads</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Beta version</p></li><li><p>Stability problems (frequent crashing)</p></li><li><p>Requires Internet connection for E-mail</p></li><li><p>About and Print options don't work</p></li><li><p>Missing menu items
