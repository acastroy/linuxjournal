    This month, Mr. Lerner introduces us to a Mod-perl module to
    aid in building large, dynamic web sites.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eca580.0x1fc26b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>When we speak of dynamically generated
web content, most people immediately think of CGI, the &ldquo;common
gateway interface&rdquo;. CGI is portable across web servers, languages
and operating systems, but that portability comes at the expense of
efficiency. For example, every invocation of a CGI program written
in Perl results in the creation of a new process, in which the
program must be compiled and then interpreted.
</p><p>Programmers willing to trade speed for portability have a
number of options at their disposal. Many Perl programmers have
chosen to use <span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span>, which
makes it possible to modify Apache's behavior using Perl modules. A
Perl module invoked by mod_perl is run inside the Apache process,
removing the overhead associated with starting a separate CGI
process. <span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> also caches the
compiled version of invoked modules, eliminating the need to
compile them each time they are run. The result is a dramatic
improvement in speed, as well as the flexibility to modify Apache
quickly and easily using Perl.</p><p>For all its power, mod_perl has never appealed to me for
creating large, dynamic web sites. True, the increase in speed is
extremely impressive, and it is not that hard to work with. As we
have seen in several previous editions of this column, writing a
mod_perl module can be quite easy, and it integrates smoothly into
a larger web site.</p><p>When a site needs to create a large quantity of dynamic
output, much of which is written and designed by non-programmers,
mod_perl's power is hampered by the need to use dozens or hundreds
of modules, each servicing only a single URL or directory. The
solution to this problem is to integrate mod_perl with templates,
which intersperse HTML-formatted text with Perl code. We have
looked at templates on several previous occasions and have seen
their power and flexibility.</p><p>This month, we will look at Mason, a mod_perl module written
by Jonathan Swartz, which attempts to solve many of these problems.
It uses templates and encourages the use of separate
&ldquo;components&rdquo;, which can be built up to create a large,
dynamically generated site. Because these components exist in
separate files, Mason offers additional advantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It caches components, providing a bigger speed
boost than that from simple templates.</p></li><li><p>It provides a complete debugging and previewing
environment.</p></li><li><p>It produces output files.</p></li></ul></div><p>I first heard about Mason nearly two years ago, and kept
telling myself I would look at it one day. I finally took a serious
look at Mason several months ago, and was extremely impressed with
what I saw&mdash;enough that I expect to do most of my future
development with it.
</p><p>The number of publicly distributed Mason components is still
relatively small, which makes it seem like a poorer development
environment than Zope and commercial template solutions. However,
this situation already appears to be changing, and the number of
components will most likely increase significantly during the
coming months and years.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eca580.0x1fc2ce8"></a>Installing and Configuring Mason</h2></div></div><p>While Mason can work as a CGI program, it works best and most
easily with mod_perl. (See Resources for information on obtaining
and installing Apache and mod_perl.) Retrieve the latest version of
<span   class="bold"><b>HTML::Mason</b></span> from CPAN and follow
the same procedure as you would for any other module, detailed in
the INSTALL file that comes with it.</p><p>However, using Mason is more complicated than simply saying
&ldquo;use HTML::Mason&rdquo;. Because it works via mod_perl, which is part
of Apache, the Mason configuration must be performed when Apache
starts up. This is accomplished most easily by using a
<span   class="bold"><b>PerlRequire</b></span> statement in the
Apache configuration file, normally called httpd.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PerlRequire /usr/local/apache/conf/mason.pl
</pre><p>The above statement tells Apache to execute the Perl
statements in /usr/local/apache/conf/mason.pl when it first starts
up. Any Perl modules imported or variables declared in mason.pl are
placed into a section of memory shared across all Apache processes.
This can mean a substantial memory savings, since Perl and mod_perl
consume a large amount of memory, and most web servers run prefork
child Apache processes.
</p><p>At the very least, <span   class="bold"><b>mason.pl</b></span>
must create three different objects:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Mason parser (<b  >$parser</b>),
which turns each Mason component into a Perl subroutine.</p></li><li><p>The Mason interpreter (<b  >$interp</b>),
which executes the subroutines that were created by the parser.
When creating the interpreter
(<span   class="bold"><b>HTML::Mason::Interp</b></span>), we name two
directories in which the interpreter reads and writes information:
the Mason &ldquo;component root&rdquo; where the Mason components sit, and
the Mason &ldquo;data directory&rdquo; in which caching and debugging
information are stored. I normally set the component root to
/usr/local/apache/mason and the data directory to
/usr/local/apache/masondata.</p></li><li><p>The Mason ApacheHandler (<b  >$ah</b>),
which handles the HTTP request and generates a response.</p></li></ul></div><p>Warning: for reasons that are not entirely clear, Mason
cannot handle symbolic links. Specifying a symbolic link as a
directory name will lead to mysterious &ldquo;File not found&rdquo; errors.
On my system, /usr/local is a symbolic link to /quam/local; while
the Mason documentation does mention this quirk, it was not
explicit enough to save me more than half an hour of installation.
</p><p><a href="4002l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>A bare-bones mason.pl is shown in Listing 1. Notice how
mason.pl defines the subroutine
<span   class="bold"><b>HTML::Mason::handler</b></span>, which is
invoked once for each incoming HTTP request. In this way, Mason is
able to handle each HTTP request; the ApacheHandler takes the
request and hands it to the Interpreter, which then reads a
compiled component from the cache or parses it as necessary.</p><p>More advanced Mason installations use mason.pl to define all
sorts of additional behavior. For example, Mason comes with a
previewer/debugger component, making it possible to trace through
the execution of a component and its subcomponents. It is also
possible to define different ApacheHandler objects, one for each
type of browser or request type.</p><p>Once our mason.pl file is installed, we must tell Apache to
let HTML::Mason handle some incoming requests, rather than using
the default Apache handlers. This is where we connect the component
root to the Apache Handler. For example, if the component root is
/usr/local/apache/mason, we can say the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Alias /mason /usr/local/apache/mason
&lt;Location /mason&gt;
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler HTML::Mason
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre><p>The Alias directive tells Apache to translate every URL
beginning with /mason to the Mason component root,
/usr/local/apache/mason. The &lt;Location&gt; section tells Apache
that every URL beginning with /mason should then be handled by the
mod_perl handler HTML::Mason.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eca580.0x1fc3738"></a>Mason Components</h2></div></div><p>In the Mason universe, a &ldquo;component&rdquo; can return either HTML
or a value. The former usually consists of HTML templates or
template fragments, while the latter consists of subroutines and
other code which are invoked by templates. All components share the
same syntax, which should be familiar to anyone who has used a
template system.</p><p>Perl code can be placed inside a component, bracketed by
<b  >&lt;%</b> and <b  >%&gt;</b>. Any returned
value is inserted into the component, replacing the Perl code that
created it. For example, the following component (output.html) will
display the current time of day each time it is invoked:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Current time&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Current time&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The current time is: &lt;% scalar localtime %&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>I put the above into the file time.html and placed it in the
component root directory. Immediately after doing so, I was able to
go to the URL /mason/time.html and get the current time.
</p><p>Mason supports two other types of Perl sections, which can be
useful in different contexts. A <b  >%</b> in the first
column of a Mason component forces the entire line to be
interpreted as Perl, rather than literally. This is best used for
control structures (such as loops and if-then statements) that
produce text strings, as in the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Current time&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Months&lt;/H1&gt;
% foreach my $month (qw(Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun
% Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec))
% {
&lt;P&gt;&lt;% $month %&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
% }
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>As you can see, the <b  >&lt;% %&gt;</b> construct
works in all contexts. In addition, lexicals declared at the top
level of one Perl segment can be used within any other Perl
segment.
</p><p>Finally, long runs of Perl can be placed inside
<b  >%perl</b> blocks. This is best for doing heavy-duty
computation, rather than simply retrieving variable values. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Current time&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Months&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;%perl&gt;
my @months = qw(January February March April May
June July August September October November December);
&lt;/%perl&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The current month is &lt;% $months[(localtime)[4]]
%&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>Once again, notice how the lexical
(<span   class="bold"><b>my</b></span>) variable declared in the
<b  >&lt;%perl&gt;</b> section is available in the
following <b  >&lt;% %&gt;</b> section.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eca580.0x23bc068"></a>Calling Components</h2></div></div><p>Experienced users of
<span   class="bold"><b>Text::Template</b></span> and other Perl
templating modules are probably not very impressed at this point.
After all, there are dozens of ways to create templates of this
sort, and many work with mod_perl for extra speed.</p><p>However, Mason's template syntax includes provisions for
invoking other components, much as one subroutine might invoke
another. (Indeed, since the Mason parser turns each component into
a subroutine, this is not an incorrect analogy.) In some ways, this
is like having a heavy-duty server-side include system, allowing
you to standardize headers and footers. However, because components
can return values as well as HTML output, and because Mason makes
it possible to pass arguments to a component, things can get far
more interesting.</p><p>One component can invoke another component with the special
<b  >&lt;&amp;&nbsp;&amp;&gt;</b> syntax. For example,
the following invokes the component
<span   class="bold"><b>subcomp</b></span>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;&amp; subcomp &amp;&gt;
</pre><p>Any HTML produced by subcomp is placed at the point where it
was invoked, much like a server-side include. Each HTML page
generated by a Mason site can consist of one, five, 10, 20 or more
components. In this way, it is possible to assemble a page from
individual elements&mdash;beginning with headers and footers and moving
on to tables and pull-down menus. For example, here is a header
component:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!-- begin component: header.comp --&gt;
&lt;Body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;This is a header&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;!-- end component: header.comp --&gt;
</pre>


And here is a footer component:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!-- begin component: footer.comp --&gt;
&lt;address&gt;
&lt;a href="mailto:reuven@lerner.co.il"&gt;
reuven@lerner.co.il&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;!-- end component: footer.comp --&gt;
</pre>


Finally, here is a top-level component in which the header and
footer come from the above components:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Title&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;&amp; header.comp &amp;&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is the body&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;&amp; footer.comp &amp;&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>


Notice, I gave file extensions of &ldquo;comp&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;html&rdquo; to
the header and footer. This is simply a convention that enables me
to differentiate between top-level components (which have .html
extensions) and lower-level fragments.
</p><p>Also, notice how I begin and end each lower-level component
with HTML comments that indicate where it begins and ends. This
provides a primitive type of debugging (expanded by the Mason
previewer/debugger component) that lets me see where things are
happening, simply by viewing a component's HTML source code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eca580.0x23bc538"></a>Arguments</h2></div></div><p>The above examples of header and footer components are good
for simple sites. However, it would be more useful if our header
and footer components could take arguments, allowing us to modify
parts of their content as necessary.</p><p>Mason indeed allows components to send and receive arguments,
giving an extra level of flexibility. To pass arguments to an
invoked component, place a comma between the component's name and a
list of name,value pairs. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;&amp; header, "address" =&gt; 'president@whitehouse.gov' &amp;&gt;
</pre><p>Components can receive passed arguments in special
<b  >&lt;%args&gt;</b> sections, traditionally placed at
the bottom of a component file. An <b  >&lt;%args&gt;</b>
section declares arguments for a component, with an optional
default value if none are passed to the component. For example, the
following <b  >&lt;%args&gt;</b> section declares the
<b  >$name</b> and <b  >$address</b> variables.
An argument without a default variable is mandatory.
<b  >$name</b> has no default value, while
<b  >$address</b> has a default value of
reuven@lerner.co.il:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;%args&gt;
$name
$address =&gt; 'reuven@lerner.co.il'
&lt;/%args&gt;
</pre>


We can rewrite footer.comp in this way:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!-- begin component: footer.comp --&gt;
&lt;address&gt;
&lt;a href="&lt;% $address %&gt;"&gt;&lt;% $name ? $name : $address %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;%args&gt;
$name =&gt; ""
$address =&gt; 'reuven@lerner.co.il'
&lt;/%args&gt;
&lt;!-- end component: footer.comp --&gt;
</pre>


Finally, we can rewrite output.html to send the required parameter
without the optional parameter:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Title&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;&amp; header.comp &amp;&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is the body&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;&amp; footer.comp, "name" =&gt; 'Reuven' &amp;&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eca580.0x23bcab8"></a>$m and $r</h2></div></div><p>Experienced mod_perl programmers might like the idea of the
components Mason provides. However, there are times when it is
easiest to accomplish something by reaching into the guts of Apache
and working with the mod_perl request object, traditionally called
<b  >$r</b>.</p><p>Mason provides each component with a copy of
<b  >$r</b>, so we can work with the internals of the
server. For example, we can send an HTTP Content-type of
&ldquo;text/html&rdquo; by using the
<span   class="bold"><b>content_type</b></span> method:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$r-&gt;content_type("text/html");
</pre><p>Because <b  >&lt;%perl&gt;</b> sections are invoked
before the actual HTTP headers are returned, Mason components can
modify all response headers in this way, including working with
HTTP cookies.
</p><p>A similar object, called <b  >$m</b>, is specific
to Mason and allows us to invoke methods having to do with Mason
components and development. For example, we can retrieve the
contents of a component with the <b  >$m-&gt;scomp</b>
method. The manual page at
<span   class="bold"><b>HTML::Mason::Devel</b></span> lists many more
methods that can be invoked on <b  >$m</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eca580.0x23bcfe0"></a>Initialization</h2></div></div><p>Mason gives us two sections, <b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b>
and <b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b>, in which to run Perl code at
the beginning of a component's execution.</p><p>An <b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b> section is evaluated
before any <b  >&lt;%perl&gt;</b> sections, as well as
any other Perl code in the component. This gives the component a
chance to define variables and retrieve information on its
environment. In effect, <b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b> is the
same as <b  >&lt;%perl&gt;</b>, except it can be placed
anywhere in the component, rather than at the top. Traditionally,
<b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b> sections are placed near the
bottom, along with the other special sections.</p><p>An <b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b> section is evaluated each
time a component is invoked. However, there are items that need to
be created only the first time a component is invoked, rather than
every time. Such items can be put in a
<b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b> section. Lexicals and subroutines
declared within a <b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b> section remain
throughout the life of the component, making them particularly
useful for initializing the component's state. However,
<b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b> sections are not evaluated within
the context of a Mason request, which means they cannot invoke
other components.</p><p>Mason components that connect to a relational database with
Perl's DBI often use a combination of
<b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b>, <b  >&lt;%init&gt;</b>
and <b  >$m</b> to reuse database handles. We can do the
following, for example, as suggested in the Mason
documentation:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;%once&gt;
my $dbh;    # Declare $dbh only once
&lt;/%once&gt;
&lt;%init&gt;
# If this is the first time we're running,
# connect to the database
if ($m-&gt;current_comp-&gt;first_time)
{
$dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("DBI:mysql:$database:localhost",
                 $username, $password) ||
die qq{DBI error from connect: "$DBI::errstr"};
}
&lt;/init&gt;
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eca580.0x23bd718"></a>autohandler and dhandler</h2></div></div><p>While Mason components can create headers and footers using
the <b  >&lt;&amp;&nbsp;&amp;&gt;</b> syntax we saw
above, it becomes cumbersome to put such sections inside each
top-level component we create. For this reason, Mason supports two
special kinds of components, one called
<span   class="bold"><b>autohandler</b></span> and the other
<span   class="bold"><b>dhandler</b></span>.</p><p>If an autohandler component exists, it is invoked before each
component in the directory. That is, the autohandler is invoked and
can produce HTML output of its own before retrieving the component
that was actually requested, with
<b  >$m-&gt;call_next</b>. For example, the following
autohandler will put a uniform title and footer on each document in
its directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Welcome to our
site!&lt;/Title&gt;&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;% $m-&gt;call_next %&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;address&gt;webmaster@example.com&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>dhandler</b></span>, by contrast, is
invoked if a component does not exist. In some ways, this allows us
to rewrite the &ldquo;404--No such file&rdquo; error message that web sites
often produce.
</p><p>While autohandlers normally influence only their own
directories, dhandlers affect all subdirectories. Thus, a dhandler
in /foo will affect all documents in /foo/bar, but not in /bar.
However, an autohandler in /foo will not affect items in either
/foo/bar or /bar.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eca580.0x23bdb38"></a>Slide Show</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how Mason can work for some simple
tasks, let's look at some components I wrote for creating slide
shows. Such presentations will not have the fancy wipes and
graphics available with Microsoft's PowerPoint, but are more than
adequate for most technically oriented groups.</p><p>The slide show component consists of an autohandler, a
dhandler and one or more slides (text files) written in HTML. Each
slide consists of a piece of HTML that will be stuck inside the
<b  >&lt;Body&gt;</b>. For example, the following could
be a slide:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;H1&gt;Short Presentation&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is my short presentation.&lt;/P&gt;
</pre><p>Inside the autohandler (Listing 2; see Resources) we have a
<b  >&lt;%once&gt;</b> section that defines several
constants we will reuse, as well as <b  >@slides</b>, an
array containing the list of slides. For example, here is the value
of <b  >@slides</b> from a talk I recently gave:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my @slides = qw(start whoami free-software just-in-time
  databases mysql postgresql
  cgi mod_perl
  templates text::template minivend minivend-example
  mason mason-example mason-autohandler
  php jsp zope acs xml
  conclusion);
</pre>


By reordering the file names within <b  >@slides</b>, I
change the order of my presentation, and by removing or adding
elements from <b  >@slides</b>, I can change the length
of the presentation.
</p><p>The autohandler uses <b  >$m-&gt;scomp</b>,
described earlier, to retrieve the HTML associated with a slide. It
uses this to retrieve any headline (in
<b  >&lt;H1&gt;</b> tags) it might find within the slide
and uses the headline in the <b  >&lt;Title&gt;</b>
tag.</p><p>In addition, the autohandler produces links for the
&ldquo;previous&rdquo; and &ldquo;next&rdquo; slides. We do this by getting the index
of the current slide and retrieving the names from the
array:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $previous_slide = $slides[$current_slide_index - 1] || $slides[0];
my $next_slide = $slides[$current_slide_index + 1] || $slides[0];
</pre><p>Once we have the names of the previous and next slides, we
can retrieve their headlines, making for attractive &ldquo;previous&rdquo;
and &ldquo;next&rdquo; links:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Grab the headline from the next component
my $next_headline = $next_slide;
my $next_contents = ($m-&gt;scomp($next_slide));
if ($next_contents =~ m|&lt;H1&gt;(.+)&lt;/H1&gt;|igs)
{
    $next_headline = $1;
}
</pre>


One of the nice things about using this autohandler for slides is
that it allows me to reorder or modify a talk by shifting the names
of the files.
</p><p>In addition to the autohandler, I installed a dhandler to
take care of mistaken filenames:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Error: No such

easy-to-use templates and the complex, powerful underpinnings of
mod_perl. If you ever considered using mod_perl on your site, but
were scared away by the complexity, consider looking into Mason.
Not only is Mason free software&mdash;a good thing, for a variety of
reasons&mdash;but it is a proven tool that makes web development
significantly easier than many of its counterparts. I hope to do
much development in Mason over the coming months, and hope to share
many of my experiences and code as I grow to enjoy this new
tool.</p><p><a href="4002s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
