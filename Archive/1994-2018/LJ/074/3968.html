Programming</em></span>, I was a bit confused to find I was reading
about shell basics and not programming. My conclusion was, Mr.
Tansley is writing for the true beginner to UNIX and so is first
providing background and command information that will be needed
when the user actually begins writing scripts. He is covering the
basic or Bourne shell, which is common to all UNIX flavors
including Linux, so scripts will be portable. More than once, he
emphasizes the fact that his scripts are not the most efficient
design, but are easy to understand and reuse. The back of the book
states all scripts are available via an FTP site, but then doesn't
give an address, and I couldn't find one in the
book&mdash;strange.</p><p>The book is divided into five parts. Not until Part 4 does
Mr. Tansley actually begin to talk about programming. He expects
the reader to know only how to log in and use a text editor. While
this was a bit disappointing for me, it won't be for someone who
has not worked with UNIX for as long as I have.</p><p>This book needed better editing; the mistakes I found should
have been caught. Mr. Tansley has been a UNIX system administrator
for some time and clearly knows his subject. But run-on sentences
with improper punctuation, extra words, omitted words and
misspellings (e.g., dirrectory) make understanding the material
harder than it should be. An entire chapter is devoted to the
<span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span> command, and it contains two
serious editing problems. One, when explaining the use of the
<b  >mtime</b> option on page 25, this statement
appears:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Use &ldquo;-&rdquo; to specify files that have not been
accessed in <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> number of days. Use &ldquo;+&rdquo; for
files that have been accessed.</p></blockquote></div><p>This has the meanings of - and + reversed, as is demonstrated
in his printed examples. Two, in his explanation of the
<b  >exec</b> option, there is this statement:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>To use exec you do have to have the &ldquo;-print&rdquo;
option on.</p></blockquote></div>

Then <b  >-print</b> is not in any of the examples.
Obviously, the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; got left out of that sentence. Page 52
has a similar error: it says &ldquo;If its Linux... Remember to use -n
echo option&rdquo;, then doesn't use <b  >-n</b> in the
following example. A good editor would have caught these errors.
</p><p>In general, the explanations are good, though not heavily
detailed. The author's style is casual and simple, making it easy
to read and understand. He discusses many useful things such as
find, cron, grep, wild cards, pipes, input/output, awk, sed,
environment variables and many shell commands. All this is a
prelude to getting down to the serious business of
scripting.</p><p>Part 4 covers shell scripting, and Part 5 covers better shell
scripting. Part 4 begins with explanations of how to use
<span   class="bold"><b>test</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>expr</b></span> to determine file status and
string evaluation&mdash;a very good place to start, indeed. Then he
moves on to discuss flow control structures (e.g., if-then-else,
for, while and case), exit status, creation of menus and printing.
Examples are simple and to the point, demonstrating the current
topic quite aptly. A good example is how to make your script
interactive; that is, accept input from the keyboard rather than
run in the background. Also in Part 4, he covers passing
parameters, creating screen input, debugging and built-in
commands.</p><p>Part 5 goes on to advanced scripting, with more details on
&ldquo;here&rdquo; files and how-tos for run-level and cgi scripts. He
includes a goodly sample of his own administration scripts which
are quite helpful. There is much useful information in these two
sections to help the beginning scripter. I did not find technical
errors in these parts as I did in the beginning.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>LINUX &amp; UNIX Shell Programming</em></span> is a
good introduction to the shell as well as scripting. With a good
editor, it will be even better in a second edition. Right now, I
hesitate to recommend it to complete beginners, even though they
are its target audience; however, for someone who has used UNIX for
a short while and has the ability to sort out any confusions caused
by typos, it could provide a useful reference.</p></div></div>
