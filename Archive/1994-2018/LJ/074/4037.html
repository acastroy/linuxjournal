Linux for some time, but couldn't decide on a way to do it that
would make sense and not need the space of a book. With so many
people contributing to Linux and new ones joining the community
every day, it would be almost impossible to compile a list that
didn't leave someone out. We finally decided that what we wanted to
do was present short profiles of the developers who contributed to
kernel 1.0, and of a few others who were involved at the time of
its release. We got the kernel 1.0 credits file and split it up. I
took a few names, including Linus', having talked to him just last
year. With the help of Jason Kroll, we spent a good bit of time
tracking people down, and were not entirely successful. A list of
those whom we couldn't get hold of and the contribution they made
to the kernel is included as a sidebar. If any of you guys are
reading this, please get in touch (info@linuxjournal.com.com)&mdash;we'd like to
talk to you.</p><p>We wish to thank all these people for talking to us and
providing this look at who they were then and now. Since there was
not room to include each interview in its entirety, we will put the
interviews on the <i  >LJ</i> web site in the coming
weeks. We also thank these folks for their invaluable contributions
to Linux&mdash;without them, where would it be today? Or
<i  >LJ</i>, for that matter?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1766580.0x185e558"></a>Linus Torvalds</h2></div></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4037f1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Everyone knows who Linus Torvalds is. He's the metaphoric
father of the Linux community, having brought the Linux operating
system into being. After doing so, he kicked it out of its nest and
onto the Internet and invited others to try it out and participate
in its growth, not realizing at the time what a tiger he had let
loose on the world. He is a quiet, self-assured young man, a family
man who obviously loves his daughters, allowing them to join him
onstage at conferences they attend with him and his wife
Tove.</p><p>Writing Linux earned Linus his master's degree at Helsinki
University. Since then, he has turned kernel maintenance over to
Alan Cox. Development is done by many others, yet Linus remains the
mainstay of Linux. He makes the final decisions about what will and
will not go into the kernel and when a new version will be
released. His word is law, and no one disputes it.</p><p>After leaving the university, Linus moved to the United
States with Tove, near San Jose, California, and went to work for
the ultra-secret Transmeta. Early this year, Transmeta announced
their Crusoe chip, which is headed for the mobile appliance market.
Linus had been helping by making a Linux version that would fit in
flash ROM&mdash;here's what he said about it in a conversation with Doc
Searls.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It's the standard 2.3 kernel with some power
management stuff done on it, but anybody can see what that is.
There is the compressed file system that I made part of the
standard kernel not long ago. And that's really the question of...
you have a very limited amount of ROM. You want to fit Netscape in
there, too. And you want to page things in from the ROM. You
obviously want to compress it. That's number one. But how do you
compress it so you can still do random seeks and paging in things?
Those are the kinds of questions I spent a fair amount of time
thinking about. What's the good way of doing this? What fits in and
works well? These are not fundamental design shifts.</p></blockquote></div><p>Linus agrees to make appearances at many trade shows,
although these days, he prefers question-and-answer sessions over
giving talks. In fact, he agrees to so many that I once wondered if
he knew how to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;. (He does.) But he also realizes he is a
big draw, and helping Linux and Linux shows become successful is
something he is willing to do. He remains unassuming, and says fame
has not intruded on his personal life.</p><p>Linus has proven to be a good father to both his children and
Linux. The community couldn't have a better leader.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1766580.0x185e9d0"></a>Donald Becker</h2></div></div><p>Donald didn't respond to any of our messages, but we know a
bit about him so we decided to wing it. First of all, we know
Donald because he was on the cover of issue 10, February 1995,
where he was a part of the Linux Conference at Open Systems World
in Washington, DC.</p><p>Donald was a big contributor early in the Linux game, writing
the code for the Ethernet drivers. He did this while working for
NASA at the Center of Excellence in Space Data and Information
Sciences as a staff scientist. Information on Donald and his code
can be found at
<a href="http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/people/becker/whoiam.html" target="_self">cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/people/becker/whoiam.html</a>.</p><p>He was the principal investigator on NASA's Beowulf Project,
&ldquo;an effort to develop a software distribution to help others build
high-performance workstations based on a cluster of off-the-shelf
processing nodes running Linux.&rdquo;</p><p>He is now the Chief Technical Officer of Sycld Computing
Corporation, where he &ldquo;continues the Beowulf work, making
available the expertise to non-NASA entities.&rdquo;</p><p>For fun, Donald likes to kayak, and you can read about his
kayaking trip down the Yukon River in 1993 at his web site. There
is also a beautiful picture of the river and mountains, as well as
information on how to reach him.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1766580.0x185ec90"></a>Mark Bolzern</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4037f2.jpg"></div><p>Mark discovered Linux back in 1992, and by 1994 was
predicting it would be the next-generation UNIX and challenge even
Microsoft. That's what I call prescient. Rather than become a Linux
developer, he instead took the road of an advocate.</p><p>When he started his business, Workgroup Solutions, he sold
one of the first commercial products for Linux: Multisoft's
FlagShip. In fact, he persuaded Multisoft to port it to Linux in
the first place. He also sold his own distribution, Linux Pro,
based first on Slackware and later on Red Hat. It was always a bit
behind the cutting edge, but this meant it was always stable, a
definite plus for the business market at which he was aiming.
Today, with all the advances in Linux distributions, he no longer
feels there is a need for Linux Pro and has withdrawn it from the
market. Workgroup Solutions has turned into LinuxMall, and as a
business proves that supporting Linux can bring success.</p><p>When asked what he liked most about Linux, Mark replied,
&ldquo;Its openness, its use of the GPL, its ability to educate those
willing to take responsibility to educate themselves, and finally,
its flexibility to adapt to the needs of anyone educationally
empowered or able to hire someone who is.&rdquo; He strongly compares
Linux and American history in this way: &ldquo;I see the Linux movement
as a parallel to the American Revolution, where the GPL is
analogous to the Constitution. This, I guess, makes Richard
Stallman a Thomas Jefferson, and perhaps `The Cathedral and the
Bazaar' is the Declaration of Independence.&rdquo;</p><p>Mark dedicates his life to his business and Linux advocacy,
finding no time for a family or even a vacation. However, he
doesn't feel he is wasting his life on computers, but rather
providing a service that will benefit others and perhaps even the
whole world, when Linux achieves &ldquo;world domination&rdquo;. His belief
in serving others is proven through the way he runs his company. He
hires people who are already a part of the Linux community, and
gives a percentage of the company's gross profit back to the
community in support of Linux events, projects and public relations
work.</p><p>An all-around nice guy, Mark is a familiar face at the trade
shows. His web page is

simple explanation as to why it worked for him:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I tried it and it worked. In fact, it worked
really well. FreeBSD I tried later, and I preferred Linux.</p></blockquote></div><p>Unlike many of those whose hacking of the Linux kernel was a
natural by-product of their work as a computer scientist,
programmer or software developer, Andries, who managed
international character handling for the Linux keyboard and
console, arrived at Linux through a different route.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I use my machines mostly for mathematics&mdash;(for)
both computations and writing papers and books. Whenever something
is wrong, I like to fix it, and this brought me to various parts of
the kernel, mostly with small fixes, sometimes with slightly larger
code fragments.</p></blockquote></div><p>But working on Linux over the Internet, in fact working over
the Internet itself, is nothing new to Andries, who today still
considers himself a mathematician.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I released Hack on the Net, maybe around 1984.
This led to lots of contacts with many people all over the Net,
both via e-mail and via net.games.hack. So, to me, cooperation over
the Net was a well-known concept, not revolutionary at all.
</p><p>Andries Brouwer's e-mail address is aeb@cwi.nl.</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1766580.0x185f478"></a>Ed Carp</h2></div></div><p>Ed Carp, whose contributions to the Linux kernel include work
on cron, UUCP, Elm, Pine and pico, first ran into Linux in late
1991 when someone forwarded him the Linux project announcement from
a BSD newsgroup.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I was attracted to Linux because of the
distributed development model. I had looked at 386BSD, but the
development model was completely controlled by William Jolitz, who
made releases about every six months, and I couldn't wait for bug
fixes that long.</p></blockquote></div><p>Sound familiar? At the time, Ed was working at Sun
Microsystems, &ldquo;downloading a full newsfeed via a Telebit modem to
a XENIX box.&rdquo; When his upstream newsfeed switched to HDB UUCP, and
the XENIX UUCP could not support the new protocols, Ed went
searching. &ldquo;When I called SCO, they quoted me $1500 to upgrade my
very old XENIX. So I was in the market for something cheaper and
that I could tweak the source if I needed to.&rdquo;</p><p>Insofar as Ed's Linux hacking rose directly from his computer
needs, UUCP, Sendmail and Elm were among his first Linux
contributions. Of the times, Ed remembers &ldquo;overnight, I became the
application port guru. People were e-mailing me from all over the
world, trying to get their applications ported over.&rdquo; He also
counts driver and kernel work among his larger
contributions.</p><p>Unfortunately, nowadays many of those moving most quickly
around the Linux community are, for lack of a better word, the
carpetbaggers. To those people, Ed shows very little regard,
admitting that</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I think [Linux] would've survived
regardless&mdash;there are a lot of operating systems around that
haven't received the publicity that Linux has, and are doing quite
well ... I think the popularity of Linux can be a two-edged
sword.</p></blockquote></div><p>Ed is still involved with computers and, more importantly,
still involved with Linux. He says, &ldquo;I'm involved in two projects,
one to bring a port of Linux to a PowerPC platform for an embedded
ATM controller, and two to develop a new server-side scripting
language for the Web.&rdquo;</p><p>And outside of computers?</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I backpack, and am also involved in ham radio. I
don't think I've wasted my life. Working with computers has
produced a lot of personal satisfaction for me. I've written pager
notification systems for severe weather alerts, and I'd like to
think that software has saved a life or two along the way.

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4037f3.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Among the Who's Who of the Linux Kernel, Alan Cox is probably
one of the bigger Whos in the bunch. From his work on the Linux
networking code to his current role as maintainer of the stable
kernel releases, there are few who have meant as much to Linux as
Alan.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I like the flexibility and the control of free
software. Most of my experiences with proprietary software have
been either getting screwed as a user or being part of a larger
company that had to threaten its suppliers with lawsuits to get
service.</p></blockquote></div><p>Somewhat provocative, but a familiar cheer and lament from
many who have spent a goodly amount of time with Linux and
open-source software.</p><p>Alan was actually working on ideas for his own operating
system when his interest in Linux first began.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I had pondered getting a decent PC since the
Amiga was getting a bit long in the tooth. 386BSD came out, and it
looked like finally there was an OS worth running on x86 hardware.
Linux came out about the same time, but didn't need an FPU, so I
started running Linux.</p></blockquote></div><p>As one of the operating system's true progenitors, Alan is
well aware of the importance of the GNU project to the development
and maturation of Linux.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In fact, in many ways Linux exists because GNU
chose to pursue the HURD rather than using UZI as their UNIX OS
core ... GNU/Linux is perhaps overstating it, but ignoring the FSF
(Free Software Foundation) contribution is even worse ... It's
really x11/BSD/GNU/.../Linux.</p></blockquote></div><p>Alan now works for Red Hat, the poster boy and problem child
for many in and around the Linux community. He still has time,
however, to hack free software at home, as well as visit friends
and colleagues while traveling to conferences and trade shows.
While there are many more people who have contributed to Linux than
could ever fit under one roof, Alan seems to have made his peace
working for &ldquo;a vendor.&rdquo;</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I get regular mail from people trying to find
Linux-aware folks to hire. I think those who wrote code for fun
have plenty of opportunity to reap rewards. Even when I wasn't
working for Red Hat, it didn't bother me. I wrote it for fun, and
the fact that people found it useful was a greater reward than
money.

yet moved on to a relatively hack-free lifestyle, Laurence Culhane
is one of those who stands out. A radio presenter for the BBC when
he first encountered Linux, today Laurence is a senior BBC
journalist. But in between then and now, he enjoyed several heady
years in the thick of Linux kernel hacking. He recalls,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It was fun. At first I didn't realize how
revolutionary the idea was&mdash;it seemed so natural. It wasn't
perfect, and with only limited free time, I found it quite hard to
keep up with the demands for improvements to what had initially
been just a quick hack to keep me connected.</p></blockquote></div><p>Like many others, including Linus Torvalds himself,
Laurence's Linux hack sprang from &ldquo;purely selfish reasons.&rdquo; As he
tells the story,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I wanted Usenet and e-mail, and for that I needed
SLIP/PPP. Neither had been written at the time, so I went and
looked at the RFC's and wrote something that gave me adequate SLIP
access.</p></blockquote></div><p>Laurence wrote the original alpha SLIP code for the Linux
kernel &ldquo;and sent Linus the odd patch when I couldn't get other
code to port and it looked like a kernel issue.&rdquo; Given Laurence's
need-based arrival in the world of Linux and open-source software,
it is little surprise that much of the philosophy behind the Linux
movement was initially lost on him: &ldquo;I hadn't thought about free
software, free speech or anything at that point. I just wanted
Linux to work.&rdquo;</p><p>What attracted him to Linux? &ldquo;The fact that it was free was
the first reason I looked at it,&rdquo; Laurence admits. &ldquo;I'd just left
the university, had no money and certainly couldn't afford
thousands of pounds [for] a commercial UNIX license.&rdquo; It was at
the university where Laurence got his first taste of a major UNIX
system. Having built his first s-100 z-80A system at the age of 15,
he &ldquo;fell in love with BSD UNIX&rdquo; while at the university, &ldquo;found
a 32016 S-100 CPU and MINIX and never left.&rdquo;</p><p>Although Laurence no longer considers himself a Linux
developer, he is still a regular Linux user and tries to keep up
with the latest developments in Linux in general and the kernel in
specific. While he thinks the current popularity surrounding Linux
is &ldquo;great,&rdquo; he thinks a little reserve is probably a good idea.
He says,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I think it's important that people don't get
overzealous about Linux ... I'm a passionate fan; I had never even
used an MS product until 1998 when work dictated that I did. [But]
I'm suggesting that my dad have a dual-boot Linux-Windows machine,
with a Mac emulator under Linux because having access to all three
operating systems is the right solution for his job.</p></blockquote></div><p>Laurence Culhane's e-mail address is

during its formative years is Thomas Dunbar. &ldquo;Getting TeX/METAFONT
running on Linux&rdquo; was his most significant contribution to the
operating system. Thomas had been using MINIX and doing technical
typesetting work with TeX when he first started thinking of Linux
as a way to move from his life as a math professor into &ldquo;something
computer-related.&rdquo; Says Thomas,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I needed a low-cost, programmer-friendly OS that
could use minimal PC hardware. There were no barriers, neither
technical nor social, to helping with Linux development.</p></blockquote></div><p>Like many kernel hackers, while working over the Internet was
both a fun and necessary part of working on Linux, Thomas never saw
the Internet part of his work as particularly
revolutionary&mdash;although it did play a positive role in promoting
&ldquo;family values.&rdquo; As Thomas tells it,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Linux coming along right when the Net was opening
up was very fortunate. I did not feel this myself too much, as I
already had professional contacts. However, I know this was very
significant for my son, Daniel, who was just entering [his] teens
when &ldquo;we&rdquo; started using Linux. The resulting accessibility of
expert developers provided an alternative to the normal college,
job training ...</p></blockquote></div><p>Thomas still uses Linux on his desktop (as does his
secretary), although he hasn't done any development work since his
early TeX/METAFONT days. He sees commercialism as something that
has, for the most part, helped increase the popularity and use of
Linux&mdash;yet he doesn't believe Linux will become the &ldquo;dominant
desktop.&rdquo;</p><p>Currently, Thomas is senior DBA for the Warehousing group at
Virginia Tech and also CEO of a little WebCyS shop, diads.com. Says
Thomas,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>My work is almost exclusively Oracle-related with
databases running on Sun/Solaris (though that is migrating a bit to
Linux) with Linux being a convenient client platform for system
administration and database administration of the systems.</p></blockquote></div><p>What is the most important thing to him about Linux today?
&ldquo;Keep it fun and sociable, wherever that leads,&rdquo; Thomas says.
&ldquo;The more popular, the better, in my opinion.&rdquo;</p><p>Thomas Dunbar's e-mail address is tdunbar@vt.edu.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1766580.0x18572b0"></a>Bjorn Ekwall</h2></div></div><p>Bjorn Ekwall, whose contributions to the Linux kernel include
D-Link drivers, likes to make sure that some of the people who
helped him discover and solve problems aren't forgotten. Hackers
like Joshua Kopper and Jacques Gelinas, to name a few, are among
the first Bjorn mentions.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>There were a lot of other very skilled hackers
involved ... and I tried to make sure that all got credits for
their contributions. I definitely learned a lot from these
guys.</p></blockquote></div><p>Bjorn first got involved in Linux through his devotion to
UNIX in the late 1970s. Having worked on UNIX machines as a
co-sysadmin, Bjorn had little time for the Apples and PCs that
started shipping (&ldquo;just toys,&rdquo; he called them), but because
proprietary Unices did not offer the freedom or the source code
Bjorn wanted, he had to rely on merely collecting and building the
parts of his very own UNIX machine, &ldquo;with full source.&rdquo;</p><p>It wasn't until 1992 that, while looking through
comp.sources.unix postings on Usenet, Bjorn first saw mention of
Linux. After a bit of independent research, he settled on an early
Slackware distribution. &ldquo;I think it was with the 0.99.3 kernel,&rdquo;
Bjorn says. But his reaction was epiphanic. &ldquo;It had all the
sources! It even had X11! It fitted neatly into my new 386SX/25
laptop with 5MB of memory!&rdquo; says Bjorn. &ldquo;It was close enough to
UNIX for me to give in completely!&rdquo;</p><p>And &ldquo;give in&rdquo; he did. After developing a D-Link driver for
the Linux kernel to allow him to network with his laptop, and a few
more projects dealing with kernel downloadable modules, Bjorn sent
snapshots of his patches to Linus. &ldquo;He answered by putting the
whole package up for FTP together with the official kernel
sources,&rdquo; Bjorn says. &ldquo;I admit that I was a bit flattered. A lot,
actually. Suddenly I had been promoted to an official kernel
developer/maintainer!&rdquo;</p><p>The responses from fellow Linux hackers was something that
made a serious impression on Bjorn. He says,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>the openness in the acceptance of new ideas and
the ease of getting quick and high-quality feedback is definitely
the most important thing about Linux, as far as I'm concerned. The
basic rule, &ldquo;show me the code&rdquo;, is key, since it keeps in check
those who have only opinions and no solutions.</p></blockquote></div><p>All the same, much of the Linux politicking tends to leave
him cold. Asked about commercialization, Bjorn says he has &ldquo;no
problems whatsoever&rdquo; with people making money from Linux, &ldquo;as
long as Linux stays open, which it will,&rdquo; he adds. Asked about
Microsoft, Bjorn says frankly that he doesn't care:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I'm only interested in getting access to an
environment that fills my needs, which is what my Linux-based
system does. If I need something completely new in my environment,
then I will build it. If that is useful for other people, then
that's a nice side effect.</p></blockquote></div><p>But when asked about life outside of computers ... now that's
a different story.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>There is definitely a world outside of computers,
and I try to enjoy it as much as possible ... I do &ldquo;have a life,&rdquo;
which includes my two daughters, now aged 9 and 12. We have a lot
of fun&mdash;when I'm not working, that is.

on the open-source operating system. For others, Linux represented
a momentary opportunity to explore interesting, non-trivial
software development work. It was in this latter group that Drew
Eckhardt found himself as an 18-year-old CS student at the
University of Colorado. Like other Linux hackers, Drew was not
satisfied with Bill Jolitz's BSD work, and the attraction to a
freely redistributable UNIX system proved irresistible. He told
me,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I wanted to run some free UNIX on my hardware.
Since I didn't like what Bill Jolitz was doing, that meant
Linux.</p></blockquote></div><p>Drew's first problems with his new Linux system led to his
first contribution to Linux development. &ldquo;I was too impatient to
wait for someone to fix these problems (boot blocks that didn't
work, disk driver problems), and solutions ... weren't too
difficult,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Farther on, I continued to contribute to
the Linux kernel because it was fun.&rdquo;</p><p>Drew spent most of his time as a &ldquo;Linux developer&rdquo; working
on the SCSI subsystem. But he is no longer involved in the
development end of Linux. &ldquo;Developing for the Linux kernel and
user lands would be too close to what I do at work,&rdquo; he says. The
little UNIX hacking Drew has done on his own recently has tended to
be FreeBSD.</p><p>While Drew emphasizes that the size of the Linux community of
hackers was one of the best things about it, he doesn't think there
is anything too revolutionary about the way Linux was developed. He
suggests,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In hindsight, the development effort wasn't too

(he is a software engineer for a company that builds digital video

future of proprietary software vs. open-source systems do reveal a
future for Linux. He says,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In niche markets, we'll always have proprietary
software because those markets can't or won't fund new products,
and software companies can't guarantee they'll sell the support

proprietary software is a bit silly when you can get the same
software on a CD-Recordable for a dollar.

And others? Well, for some, when it comes to Linux, once you hack,
you'll never go back.</p><p>Rik Faith is currently working with Precision Insight and, as
such, gets to spend all of his work time &ldquo;using and improving&rdquo;
Linux. Says Rik,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The popularity of Linux and the willingness of
vendors to pay for Linux improvements (both in the kernel and in
user space) have enabled me to find what is very nearly my ideal
job: I can work at home, use Linux all the time, and get paid for
improving Linux and XFree86.</p></blockquote></div><p>Rik first discovered Linux while toiling away in graduate
school. He had been working on his Ph.D when he heard &ldquo;rumors
about a free UNIX&rdquo; in late 1991. All the same, it wasn't until
spring of the following year that Rik actually downloaded the
source code and booted it up. As Rik remembers, &ldquo;it booted fine
from floppy and was able to see my old 40MB drive, but it didn't
support my Future Domain SCSI controller.&rdquo;</p><p>And this is when Rik Faith's inner penguin started
singing.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I ordered a manual for the Future Domain chip
set, and as soon as finals were over, I started to write a SCSI
device driver. After about three days, I was convinced that this
was too difficult for me. But on the fourth day, I had a working
SCSI driver!</p></blockquote></div><p>And by the end of the month, Rik's hack was fully
interrupt-driven and ready for Linux 0.97.</p><p>In addition to his work on the Future Domain SCSI driver, Rik
also worked on the APM driver, and later did kernel work on the
Direct Rendering Interface (DRI) as an engineer with Precision
Insight. And like some of the other original kernel hackers, Rik
has been involved in a number of non-kernel Linux projects. These
include maintenance of the util-linux collection and coordination
of the man page project&mdash;both of which have since been taken over
by Andries Brouwer, another of the original Linux hackers. Rik even
worked on his own Linux distribution, BOGUS Linux, with colleagues
Kevin Martin and Doug Hoffman. &ldquo;The BOGUS Linux release was the
first Linux distribution to use the `pristine source plus patches'
paradigm that is now familiar to all RPM users,&rdquo; Rik notes.</p><p>All this nonstop Linux work has kept Rik exceptionally busy
over the years. In fact, he says,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I found that I had to cut back on my Linux work

Fitzhardinge,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I started hacking it for the reason that everyone
hacked on it then: there was a lot of stuff it didn't do right, and
there were things I wanted it to do for various programming
projects.</p></blockquote></div><p>In the beginning, Jeremy was working at his first &ldquo;real
job&rdquo; when he got deep into kernel hacking. He says,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I was also looking at relatively obscure research
operating systems (Amoeba, Sprite) and wondering whether I could
run one at home. Then a friend showed me Linux, and I was amazed at
how concise it was compared to, say, SVR4.</p></blockquote></div><p>Jeremy, whose contributions to the Linux kernel include work
on file systems and VM (virtual machine), is currently working on
more &ldquo;stuff it didn't do right,&rdquo; such as autofs, the Linux
automounter that he has been trying to improve. He is also one of
those hackers who has been fortunate enough to make a living
hacking Linux. Right now, most of his work is in embedded systems,
getting Linux to boot out of flash memory on a &ldquo;reasonably
powerful PPC-based server the size of a CD-ROM drive.&rdquo;</p><p>And, as might be expected, Jeremy is thrilled with both the
prospect of commercial applications being written for Linux, as
well as the overall popular success of Linux these days. If
anything, however, Jeremy sees little sense in fixating on
competing with Microsoft. He tells us,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The number-one threat [to Linux] is thinking that
competition with Windows is important, or indeed, that all the
commercial interest is important to Linux.</p></blockquote></div><p>Let Linux be Linux, Jeremy seems to suggest, very much as
many of his hacker colleagues continue to urge:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>There's still a way to go before people will
happily sit down to a Linux machine and do work, because the
desktop applications are not there yet. I like the fact that
there's lots of different efforts, but they should all go to some
effort to keep their file formats interchangeable wherever
possible.</p></blockquote></div><p>All the same, he thinks Linux does undermine many of the
pretensions of shrink-wrapped, proprietary software. &ldquo;I think
people will become wary about buying closed-source programs as the
quality of open source improves.&rdquo; Furthermore, Jeremy believes
that the expectations open-source customers have will make
closed-source vendors more accountable.</p><p>Philosophically speaking, Jeremy is among those &ldquo;kernel
forefathers&rdquo; who places high value on the GNU Project, even though
his support for the GNU Project is more on the practical side.
&ldquo;Without GNU, we'd be stuck without a serious compiler to base
everything on, and also be without many of those programs which
make the UNIX experience,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Jeremy Fitzhardinge's e-mail address is

timekeeping. He added the kernel phase locked loop and &ldquo;fixed a
bunch of problems with timekeeping.&rdquo; He continues to assist in
this area of development, but his &ldquo;principal area is now
bug-fixing obscure conditions.&rdquo;</p><p>Linux was not Philip's first experience with developing
software via the Internet. He had done so previously with Tom Lane.
This work produced the initial version of the IJG (Independent JPEG
Group) JPEG library. The recent mission of the Mars Pathfinder used
JPEG encoding, but Philip has not yet been able to determine if
this included his work.</p><p>In 1991, Linux found him working as a consultant for a large
New York City-based bank. Philip was concerned with connecting the
company to the Internet. He relates it best:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We needed to build a system to act as the name
server. Somehow I found out about Linux, and I built a system on a
386 running 0.99pl15 and bind. It served as the external DNS server
for many years&mdash;only rebooting after power failures.</p></blockquote></div><p>Philip &ldquo;can't say anything&rdquo; about his new job, where he
works for a new startup in the Network Security field. He still
runs Linux on his laptop and home systems, but home life allows for
only the occasional bug fix. He adds, &ldquo;my principal contributions
[to Linux] are now work-related. There are times when I produce
something at work that can be given back to the community.&rdquo;</p><p>He still views Linux as a good platform for &ldquo;certain types
of solutions.&rdquo; Having more support for Linux from hardware
manufacturers on the driver end is necessary. &ldquo;It's not realistic
to rely on the free software community to produce drivers for
everything.&rdquo; Philip doesn't see Linux taking the desktop in the
next three years, citing &ldquo;no consistency in user interface style&rdquo;
as one problem. He does feel that Linux should be able to hold the
server market, as long as &ldquo;the management tools are
improved.&rdquo;</p><p>Is there a life outside computing? Philip says, &ldquo;Very much
so. If you never have children, then you will miss out on something
much more important than computers.&rdquo; He is married, has a daughter

was 24 and a student of mathematics/computer science at the
University of Wurzburg in Germany. Working as a system
administrator within the university, he &ldquo;found postings from Linus
in the comp.os.minix group, where he talked about a project of
his.&rdquo; Dirk wanted a UNIX operating system for his own machine.
&ldquo;FreeBSD didn't exist and 386BSD wasn't an option,&rdquo; says Hohndel.
Linux was the best choice, so he began to develop.</p><p>With an interest in memory management and adding hardware
support, he helped with the first Ethernet drivers (for the WD8003)
and the first SCSI support (ST01). &ldquo;Soon thereafter,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;I became involved in the first implementation of shared libraries
(based on jump tables) and applied that for the XFree86 shared
libraries.&rdquo; Dirk can recall an e-mail exchange with Linus &ldquo;where
we joked that at some time, it might be possible to run X on
Linux.&rdquo; Since then, he has continued his work with the XFree86
project, currently holding the title of Vice President.</p><p>Dirk was recently named CTO of SuSE Linux AG. This means he
spends much of his time managing projects and not so much on
programming. &ldquo;Working on XFree86 is what I do for fun,&rdquo; he says
with a smile. Helping Linux continue to grow is an overall goal.
&ldquo;Making Linux easier to use for the end user&rdquo; is one area for
Linux developers to place focus on. Dirk doesn't see this as
&ldquo;dumbing down,&rdquo; as it in no way subtracts from the power and
flexibility of the operating system.</p><p>Claiming to have a life outside computers, Dirk said,

that revolutionary when it started out. As Nick recalls,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I have seen it in action with the various source
newsgroups (alt.sources, comp.sources.unix, comp.sources.misc),
where I could make changes, submit them back to the author, and see
them in the next release. Initially, Linux wasn't all that
different. It was just an OS kernel, rather than an application. It
just grew to be a much larger scale.</p></blockquote></div><p>Nick considers his contributions to Linux to be relatively
modest&mdash;as do many original kernel hackers.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I was interested in the areas that I needed to
work for me. I contributed patches to libc4 when I found problems
... I contributed tab expansion for the tty layer in the kernel
when I wanted to use a dumb terminal that couldn't handle hardware
tabs. However, these days, my involvement normally is restricted to
tracking the Linux kernel mailing list and browsing the patches.
I'll submit minor patches from time to time, but I am not a
mainstream contributor.</p></blockquote></div><p>As a Ph.D. student at the University of Warwick, Nick first
heard about Linux through Usenet. &ldquo;I immediately subscribed to
alt.os.linux so I could read more. In early 1993, I bought a
machine specifically to run Linux.&rdquo; Nick was one of the many Linux
hackers who was weaned on UNIX, having used both BSD and the SunOS
&ldquo;almost exclusively&rdquo; since starting at the university in 1985.
The problem was that he wanted a home computer
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> he wanted to run UNIX. &ldquo;When Linux became
available, it was the obvious choice to me,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It had
enough to get started and be usable, but there was plenty of scope
for being able to contribute to the development.&rdquo;</p><p>This best-of-both-worlds thinking carries over to Nick's
opinion of Linux's present-day situation. The open-source operating
system's exceptional popularity, he thinks, has definitely helped
quicken the pace of development, guessing that Linux might have
remained &ldquo;a hacker's plaything&rdquo; otherwise. As such, Nick believes
there is a place for commercial applications being written for
Linux. He says,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Just because the OS and many of the standard
applications are free doesn't mean they all have to be. If a
company has to invest in producing an application for Linux, then
they have the right to charge for it.</p></blockquote></div><p>In fact, as far as Nick is concerned, such so-called
profiteering can actually end up helping the Linux development
community. &ldquo;For example, Red Hat and SuSE are in the position to
employ important hackers, which means [hackers] don't suffer from
real work getting in the way of their Linux work.&rdquo;</p><p>Which is something Nick knows all too well. Currently
employed in &ldquo;the development of business-to-business e-commerce
solutions,&rdquo; Nick spends his work time with Windows NT and Solaris.
All the same, he says, it's not so bad. &ldquo;It allows me to separate
work and play in a clean way.&rdquo;</p><p>Nick Holloway's e-mail address is

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4037f5.jpg"></div>
</p><p>In typical open-source development fashion, Rob Hooft began
hacking on Linux &ldquo;because I could&rdquo;. There were limitations to the
0.95c++ kernel (the first one he installed at home). Rob says,
&ldquo;0.95c++ was only 200KB in .Z form&rdquo; and it did hang on his home
machine. So, he jumped into the kernel in order to understand the
driver and implement modifications. This was how Rob became a Linux
contributor.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I improved the OPL3 sound code in the kernel
sound driver; changed the floppy formatting routines to use sector
shifting; and helped develop some shared libraries.</p></blockquote></div><p>Linux had little in the way of libraries then, but as we all
know, Linux development grew because of what wasn't there.</p><p>When Rob first encountered Linux, he was at a UNIX users
group meeting of the Dutch Hobby Club. Linux was the only true free
UNIX. Ignoring the limitations, he &ldquo;decided that Linux was what I
had been waiting for, and I bought a computer (my first x86 after a
Z80) specifically to run it.&rdquo; He had a lot of faith, seeing that
Linux was equipped with &ldquo;only 64 processes, with 64MB virtual
address space each; only four partitions on a hard disk (maximum
64MB each); init/getty/login (IGL) were barely completed; and no
X.&rdquo; One of the true wonders of the Linux world comes from the
belief early developers had in the potential of Linux.</p><p>Rob is now a programmer for Nonius BV, which makes &ldquo;machines
that are used for crystal structure analysis. The control software
is written almost completely in Python on a Linux machine, using
Tcl/Tk GUI.&rdquo; He is using only free software to create a commercial
application. Rob made the shift from academia to industry because
of his wife and son, and a little thing called job security. Not
surprisingly, he doesn't have a problem with, as he puts it,
&ldquo;smart brains getting rich, even if they're not
programmers.&rdquo;</p><p>Though he writes commercial software, Rob tries to make
certain modules freely available, but</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>only if they are generally applicable. If I make
the whole lot open source, the only one studying it would be our
competitors. My competitors are not feeding my family.</p></blockquote></div><p>Fair enough. Rob Hooft can be reached at

a lot more time on it than on gnawing pencils over my theorems.&rdquo;
He did finish the thesis eventually and went on to write the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Linux Network Administrators' Guide</em></span> (first
published in 1993). This was his first Linux project, and it has
since gone to paperback and no doubt sits on many a system
administrator's desk.</p><p>Attracted to Linux by the lack of an &ldquo;initial&rdquo; hierarchy,
Olaf worked with Jeff Uphoff on the first Linux security list, then
turned his efforts toward Linux NFS implementation. He has
maintained the user space NFS daemon for the past five years, but
has &ldquo;toned down&rdquo; his overall involvement to spend more time with
his wife Maren and their 18-month-old daughter.</p><p>Looking back on the early days, Olaf was struck by &ldquo;the
cooperative spirit that reinforced itself.&rdquo; Nothing has changed
there. The community has always been the driving force behind
Linux. The Internet has always helped to connect to the community.
Back then, Olaf relates, &ldquo;it [the Internet] felt like giving
money-grubbing UNIX vendors the finger.&rdquo; He credits
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> wanting to pay hundreds of dollars for
inferior software as a key factor that drove early Linux
development.</p><p>As for the future of Linux, Olaf is hopeful that the major
Linux distributors will adopt the Linux Standard Base definition.
Olaf sees platform differences between the various distributions as
an increasing obstacle to software vendors entering the market. He
believes that &ldquo;once LSB is finished and accepted, there will be a
common base platform for porting commercial software to Linux, and
we will experience a surge in new software being made available on
Linux.&rdquo;</p><p>He currently works for Caldera, doing &ldquo;security and a lot of
network stuff, as well as developing an admin tool framework.&rdquo;
Working for Caldera affords him an opportunity he did not dream of

He founded sbay.org in 1993, which he calls &ldquo;a communications geek
group in Silicon Valley.&rdquo; He is still the group's coordinator and
notes that Linux has been the backbone of the group's
infrastructure since the beginning. Ian also helped with the Usenet
Volunteer Votetakers. He contributed a module (mod_mime_magic) to
Apache and helped start the Apache JServ (Java servlet engine)
project.</p><p>His work with Linux was born out of time spent in Amdahl's
mainframe UNIX lab in 1992, where he first discovered Linux. He
says, &ldquo;I had been involved with maintaining the
<span   class="bold"><b>smail</b></span> mail transport agent on
Amdahl's mainframes.&rdquo; He noticed that smail was not yet ported to
Linux. He did the port on a 486, then passed his work on to the
smail maintainers. &ldquo;Little did I know at the time, I had made the
first Linux e-mail server.&rdquo; He continued his work with smail by
maintaining the Linux binaries on Sunsite, an early Linux FTP site.
He maintained smail for Debian and Slackware until mid-1995, when
&ldquo;it looked like the Linux distributions were able to handle e-mail
servers on their own.&rdquo;</p><p>Ian was attracted to Linux because he didn't feel limited by
a commercial organization. Like many, he didn't want to pay SCO
$800 for a two-user UNIX license. After a few weeks, he had Linux
running on a 386. The real draw was that there was no one telling
him what he could or could not do with <span   class="emphasis"><em>his</em></span>
computer. &ldquo;Any code I could write, I could run. Anyone competent
enough to be the system administrator of their own server had
uncommon computing power in their homes.&rdquo; Like the rest of us, the
current success of Linux astounds Ian and he certainly &ldquo;never
expected to end up with Linux stock worth about a year's
salary.&rdquo;</p><p>In 1995, Ian left Amdahl for a smaller, lesser-known company
called Cisco Systems. He is currently a software engineer in
Cisco's IOS technologies division. Outside the computing/Linux

Association, serving a term as president. He has a strong interest
in amateur rocketry and works with other rocketry hobbyists &ldquo;on

</p><p>Michael was introduced to UNIX during the first week of his
freshman year at St. Olaf College. He was &ldquo;deeply impressed by the
communication potential of a true multi-tasking and multi-user
system.&rdquo; He was primarily attracted to UNIX, but his student
budget sent him looking for another alternative. BSD386 wasn't
available, and there was no free software alternative. He tried
Coherent, &ldquo;but they didn't deliver on their promises [SCSI
drivers, networking, etc.] and weren't interesting as a
result.&rdquo;</p><p>After the release of kernel 0.02, Michael downloaded Linux
and placed an order for an IDE hard drive to run it. &ldquo;I was
excited to see that my dream of a home-built operating system was
viable.&rdquo; From there, he read the entire kernel source code in an
attempt at understanding the user space. He has worked on many
aspects of Linux development, but focused mainly on user space,
&ldquo;specializing in system component interface and integration.&rdquo;
Michael helped Matt Welsh with the Linux Documentation Project and
worked on writing procps and the parallel port device driver, as
well.</p><p>It is interesting to hear Michael talk about the early
development of Linux. He admits that &ldquo;...there was no way you
could call me a hacker. I was quite clueless&mdash;as was, in some ways,
Linus when he started.&rdquo; The early developers of Linux weren't
always experienced programmers. Many learned as they went, sharing
their knowledge with others. He says, &ldquo;we developed a community
that worked despite its imperfections ... and didn't waste time
pondering the idea that we might be making history.&rdquo;</p><p>He isn't upset with the commercialization of Linux, saying it
&ldquo;has made it possible for me to put Linux on my father's
computer.&rdquo; This is something the early developers probably didn't
foresee. At least it wasn't <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> reason they
volunteered their efforts. Michael had no idea he would be able to
make a living by working on Linux. Like many, he worked on Linux to
learn, and as he says, &ldquo;that learning was sufficient compensation
for my volunteered efforts.&rdquo;</p><p>Michael currently works at Red Hat, which he says provides a
good balance between his desire to work on Linux and the need to
make money. He was an early editor of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and co-authored <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Application

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4037f9.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Bas wrote the ftape driver. A Linux driver did not exist, so
Bas decided to write one. His reason: &ldquo;because I needed it and
thought it might be useful for others.&rdquo; This is how open-source
software gets developed. His continued work with Linux produced the
code that would become the kernel modules package. The package
allowed driver development and debugging without constantly having
to reboot. As Bas says, &ldquo;It also allowed the user of the ftape
module to load it only when needed, keeping kernel memory usage as
low as possible.&rdquo; Though his real job forced him to &ldquo;pass the
ftape driver to a new maintainer,&rdquo; his modules code was eventually
integrated into the kernel tree.</p><p>In early 1993, Bas &ldquo;found a complete `free UNIX clone' on a
local BBS.&rdquo; It took him a few weeks to download the kernel, but
the result was the ability to use UUCP to retrieve information from
the Internet, including e-mail. &ldquo;That was part of the thrill:
development via the Internet was fascinating.&rdquo; Bas credits the
Internet with bringing together highly talented and motivated
people, most of whom were working to &ldquo;contribute to and create the
most perfect system.&rdquo; His experience was far from unique.</p><p>Bas still works at the same company as he did back then, but
is contemplating ways to combine his family life and make money
developing Linux. This shouldn't be too difficult for someone with
his credentials and commitment to open-source philosophy. However,
he is concerned that the large sums of money being tossed around in
the name of Linux will change everything. He worries that the
success of Linux might pose the biggest threat. &ldquo;Way too much
money is involved, and I'm not sure that Linux is ready to replace
the Microsoft-based environments yet,&rdquo; he says. Bas would like
developers to place more focus on making Linux easier to install
and on making the switch from Windows more transparent.</p><p>When asked if there is a world outside computers, Bas

serving as its security officer.</p><p>When his opinion of Linux was higher, Warner worked to get
his company's C++ toolkit and GUI open sourced. He also worked on
porting Linux to the ARC-based RISC machine, which was built around
the MIPS processor at a time when Microsoft was touting the Intel
processor. He was also involved with the early efforts to bring
Linux up on the Windows CE devices. His Linux days are basically
over, though. He thinks Linux's development model is horrible. &ldquo;I
stopped using Linux on my Intel machine because it took so much
time to keep up to date. Download a new kernel, and you will need a
new libc. But that libc will also need a new gcc, and the new gcc
needs new bitutils. It all got very hard to keep track of.&rdquo;</p><p>Now, Warner prefers the FreeBSD development model, &ldquo;where
you get the entire tree from one place ... which makes it easier to
contribute back to FreeBSD faster.&rdquo; He thinks the GPL is &ldquo;evil,&rdquo;
preferring the BSD license &ldquo;because it encourages cooperation.&rdquo;
Cooperation between developers made Linux what it is today. Warner
refers to the &ldquo;millions of random monkeys writing&rdquo; for Linux as
the best thing about Linux. However, he adds &ldquo;the worst thing is
that there's little filtering of their code or making the
architecture coherent or stable over the long term.&rdquo; As for the
future, if Linux is to continue to succeed, he says, &ldquo;it needs to
organize its chaos.&rdquo;</p><p>Warner Losh can be reached via e-mail at

while he was a student looking for a &ldquo;decent OS&rdquo; for his 16MHz
386sx with only 4MB RAM&mdash;a common theme among many of our original
kernel hackers. Not a big fan of Windows, and unable to get his
hands on BSD, H.J. not only started running Linux, but soon got
involved with Linux development. &ldquo;Many things didn't work and I
needed them,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>As a Linux developer, H.J. worked on the kernel's C library,
binutils and gcc, the latter a project he had been working on
before he even learned about Linux. Similarly, H.J. had learned
about the GNU project&mdash;which he calls &ldquo;very crucial to
Linux&rdquo;&mdash;before starting on Linux, as well.</p><p>Without a doubt, having access to the source code is what
made (and makes) Linux worthwhile to H.J. &ldquo;We can fix it if it
doesn't work,&rdquo; he emphasizes. At the same time, H.J. is undaunted
by the increasing commercial interest in Linux. &ldquo;I think Linux
will attract commercial developers who are threatened by Microsoft
and want to make money on Linux,&rdquo; he says. Given the fact that
H.J. works for VA Linux Systems, it is perhaps no surprise that he
is less intimidated by commercial interests than others may
be.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I don't mind that people profit from my work. I
do it because I enjoy it&mdash;it is not bad to get paid to do what you
enjoy.</p></blockquote></div><p>Where does Linux need to go from here? H.J. has a couple of
areas he would like to see worked on further, including a
journaling file system, &ldquo;decent NFS&rdquo; and improved VM and
networking. As for the Linux-on-the-desktop battle, he is convinced
that more desktop applications will be important in winning over
more end-user converts, whether the applications are commercial or
free. &ldquo;But the basic stuff,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;should be free.&rdquo;</p><p>H. J. Lu's e-mail address is hjl@valinux.com.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1766580.0x1deb4c0"></a>James MacLean</h2></div></div><p>

accepted early on for anything we could get it to do.</p></blockquote></div><p>This makes for a good balance between work and Linux. Plus,
he gets paid. Not surprisingly, then, James believes &ldquo;all the
financial activity is part of what makes Linux fun to be a part
of.&rdquo; He doesn't resent or fear the money influence. Instead, he
welcomes the commercialization of Linux, seeing it as &ldquo;an honest
way to support Linux.&rdquo; James says, &ldquo;the biggest addition [needed
for Linux] would be more applications that are currently supported
on Windows.&rdquo;</p><p>He expects Linux to grow on the desktop, and believes that
&ldquo;over time, it will leave fewer reasons to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> deploy it as a desktop solution.&rdquo; The
only thing he sees that could ultimately hurt Linux development
would be if the leadership in Linux diminished. In case we forgot,
James reminds us that &ldquo;taking over the world&rdquo; is still the goal,
and he thinks it is highly unlikely that the &ldquo;people and parts
that make up the heart of Linux&rdquo; will curtail their devotion to
its development.</p><p>James discovered Linux through a friend who had seen mention
of a &ldquo;free UNIX-type OS&rdquo; in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span> magazine.
Not quite thirty and newly employed by the government, he worked to
automate the mainframe connection in order to collect data. He was
&ldquo;trying to make use of OS/2 2.0 on a 4MB 386DX33 ... but missed
the flexibility of UNIX.&rdquo; OS/2 was too slow, and Windows wasn't
production-ready: &ldquo;It crashed too much with the applications I
tried to use.&rdquo; It's reassuring to know that some things never
change. James eventually found Linux.</p><p>He doesn't have much time these days to work on Linux outside
of the office, but he does appreciate all the effort being put
forth by others. James does custom things around the office to meet
the specific needs of his section. This work generally does not
find its way outside the office, but someday it might. He points
out,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It used to be that even in a crude form you could

</p><p>Kai Makisara didn't begin working on Linux
<span   class="emphasis"><em>because</em></span> he is Finnish, but it did seem
<span   class="emphasis"><em>proper</em></span>. &ldquo;I was using UNIX systems at work and
wanted to be able to do some research work at home,&rdquo; he explains.
Linux supported most of his hardware, so he chose it over the BSD
variants and Windows, which he could not run on his hardware
without major changes.</p><p>Kai first saw references to Linux in network news. This was
in 1992, and he was 38 years old. At the time, he was working on
remote-sensing methods at the Technical Research Centre of Finland.
Coming from a research organization, he found development via the
Internet to be &ldquo;natural and not revolutionary.&rdquo; He had been using
&ldquo;the network to exchange messages, software and data for a long
time.&rdquo;</p><p>Kai began working on an area of Linux that related best to
his background in computer science. He says, &ldquo;I had used SCSI
devices in our workstations, and tapes were/are an essential part
of remote sensing work.&rdquo; So, making a SCSI tape driver was a
natural choice. Kai still maintains the SCSI tape driver and posts
the occasional fix.</p><p>&ldquo;The biggest threat to Linux,&rdquo; in Kai's opinion, &ldquo;is that
all key people working on Linux lose interest.&rdquo; This has always
been a bit of a problem, but thankfully there has been no real
shortage of developers willing to contribute. He doesn't &ldquo;think
that Linux should compete with Microsoft in the fields where they
are strongest.&rdquo; Kai finds &ldquo;systems that enable people to process
information anywhere&rdquo; are much more interesting than the
traditional desktop. &ldquo;I have never accepted the attitude that work
can be done only [by] sitting on one's chair facing one's personal
computer.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Continued development is necessary for Linux's survival,&rdquo;
he continues. The current popularity of Linux makes him happy, as
it shows that good software can be successful without being backed
by large sums of money. But he does point out that &ldquo;if better and
affordable solutions for my computing needs emerge, I may jump
ship.&rdquo;</p><p>Kai continues to work on remote sensing research at the

years, some of our original kernel hackers have expressed surprise,
enthusiasm or a cautious optimism over the distance the open-source
operating system has traveled, from Internet hack to Wall
Street/Silicon Valley darling. But in and among the many comments
we've heard a slight tone of nostalgia for the old days, typified
by the passing comment from one of those original kernel hackers,
John Martin.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It might have been more fun within a small
community. With the Internet early on, there was a sufficiently
large community to sustain itself, while it was not viewed as
threatening to the powerful. [However,] once Linux got bigger, it
may have been important to get very big, very quickly.</p></blockquote></div><p>Today, John Martin is an independent consultant with
&ldquo;practically no time to call my own,&rdquo; he says. But once upon a
time, he was just another hacker looking for something interesting
on which to ply his talents. &ldquo;I was working with big iron, but was
interested in learning about UNIX when I stumbled upon the
Linux-activists list,&rdquo; John says. He had a new Intel box that
&ldquo;would not run anything until I tried Linux, which worked
immediately.&rdquo; Worked, that is, except for a small file system
problem that he was able to fix by way of a workaround developed by
Stephen Tweedie. John was up and running within two hours of first
trying to boot from the floppy. &ldquo;I never looked back,&rdquo; John says.
&ldquo;I wanted to do what little I could to put something back into the
community.&rdquo;</p><p>He calls the Linux activists &ldquo;congenial and productive&rdquo;.
But, like many original kernel hackers, he didn't think he and his
colleagues had embarked upon anything especially new, per se. &ldquo;The
challenge to the orthodoxy of large-scale software development was
apparent long before Linux 1.0,&rdquo; John notes. Similarly, John has
little time for the financial pyrotechnics that have accompanied
Linux's rising popularity as a potential &ldquo;Windows killer,&rdquo; nor is
he particularly interested in issues of commercialization of Linux
or what is often called Linux profiteering. John says,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If commercial applications must be written,
better they be written for Linux than for something else.
Proprietary software and protocols are evil for practical reasons.
Linux and open software and protocols are good for practical
reasons. It is because these practical reasons are profound that
they are embodied in a philosophy.</p></blockquote></div><p>A tremendous fan of the GPL, which John considers the most
important thing about Linux (&ldquo;the GPL and the Linux development
community ... seem inseparable&rdquo;), he is no less passionate about
open-source software in general. &ldquo;Support only open source,&rdquo; he
says. &ldquo;Unless one believes that the value of pi and the human

&ldquo;using Linux 0.97pl2 and submitting bug reports in August 1992.&rdquo;
He gave up the &ldquo;research environment&rdquo; of his job as an
electronics engineer to study theoretical physics. This led him to
the mathematics department at Monash University. At the time, Linux
did the things he needed, while UNIX systems were too expensive for
personal use. Bill says, &ldquo;I was sick of the closed world of
proprietary software.&rdquo; This was the impetus for his work in free
software. He went from using MS-DOS and Turbo-C to DJ Delorie's
port of gcc (djgpp). Linux took him in the direction he wanted to
go.</p><p>Bill's involvement with mathematics gave him the ability he
needed to help improve the FPU (floating-point unit) emulator in
djgpp. Not being able to afford a machine with an FPU provided him
with &ldquo;the motivation to work on an emulator.&rdquo; Linux had poor
support for FPU emulation, so Bill transferred his work to Linux
and continued the development. He isn't too involved with kernel
development these days, but still maintains the FPU
emulator.</p><p>He sees Microsoft as the biggest threat to &ldquo;World
Domination&rdquo;, but hopes the recent ruling against Microsoft will
benefit the revolution. The commercialization of Linux is a
necessary element to continued success, he points out. And what of
profiteering from the volunteered work of others? &ldquo;Profiteering is
an inherent part of capitalism as it exists today. Greed is good&rdquo;,
he says.</p><p>As for the future of Linux, Bill believes the desktop
interface will need to be dumbed down. He adds,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The trick is to keep the dummies away from the

enough to blame you if they climb the fence and fall over the
cliff.</p></blockquote></div><p>Outside the computer world, Bill is secretary of the

Believe it or not, not all her projects are Linux, but most involve
the computer. She has forgotten what the word &ldquo;fun&rdquo; means (just
kidding) and is comfortable with the computer dominance of her
life.</p><p>She discovered Linux through the free UNIX version, MINIX. At
first, she contributed small fixes here and there, but after
developing an interest in connecting all her computers to the
Internet, she developed the IP Masquerade module&mdash;real programming
by a real programmer. Her main development interest for Linux today
is in video4linux, maintaining the Zoran driver in the kernel, and
&ldquo;some VCR projects.&rdquo;</p><p>With work and personal life taking up much of her time,
Pauline finds it harder to keep up with developments and says, &ldquo;I
am having some concerns about getting behind current developments.
It's hard to know what is going on, and with the advent of the
Internet and worldwide development, things can happen incredibly
fast.&rdquo;</p><p>Pauline feels the Linux community owes a lot to the GNU
project and thinks it might be fun to have a distribution from them
named &ldquo;GNU/Linux&rdquo;. That's Debian, isn't it? She is more
interested in Linux remaining a good, robust OS than in seeing it
become popular in the user world&mdash;&ldquo;a difficult low-profile market
that doesn't bring in new developers.&rdquo;</p><p>When I asked her what Linux still needed in order to continue
growing, she told me:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Full-blown USB. USB devices are crawling out of
the wall everywhere, and not supporting all of them would be a

experience is difficult to describe,&rdquo; he says. Rick was into Linux
before the first free BSD. He was an engineer at an electric power
utility and was looking for a UNIX-like system to run on his PC at
work. Then he heard about Linux on Usenet (comp.os.coherent). He
&ldquo;decided to give it a try because it was free.&rdquo; Rick
admits,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>... another draw was Linus' own personality. One
guy was so pleased at the money [given to him] he saved using Linux
that he started a fund to send money to Linus. Linus nearly
refused, complaining almost belligerently that no one should expect
anything in return for the money and that he would probably spend
it all on pizza and beer.</p></blockquote></div><p>This only fed the flame, as the community began to rally
around Torvalds.</p><p>Rick contributed to Linux by maintaining a &ldquo;registry of
device allocations.&rdquo; Say you were writing a device driver and had
this question: &ldquo;Where can I find out what major:minor numbers
aren't being used so I can use them in my new driver?&rdquo; Rick saw
this as a necessary service. Linus agreed, and Rick became the
maintainer.</p><p>Since the early days, Rick's &ldquo;career shifted into more
computer-related fields where [he] was obliged to write Windows
software.&rdquo; However, his current job, as a key software engineer at
Merge Technologies, Inc., involves developing medical imaging
products to run on Linux. &ldquo;We're creating our own distribution to
carry it and I get to dabble in the SCSI kernel code!&rdquo; Good
luck.</p><p>Rick isn't bothered by money infiltrating the Linux
community, and he doesn't share the view of some that undeserving
profiteers are making money at the expense of Linux
developers.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The people making big bucks ... are the ones who

I knew it would be big from the beginning. I helped because when
things don't work right, well, it annoys me. Plus, everything else
cost too much or was lousy. Except for FreeBSD, which I didn't know
existed. I'm not sure it even did exist at that point in

outside work and Linux, and has a wife and two children to prove
it. He says,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Of course, a world exists outside of computers.

</p><p>Johan Myreen is an easy fellow to talk to, giving his
opinions and thoughts completely without prodding. He chose to work
on Linux, discovering it at version 0.11, because Microsoft Windows
had its &ldquo;roots in toy operating systems, running on toy
microcomputers,&rdquo; while UNIX's roots are in a &ldquo;more powerful
computing environment.&rdquo; He gave us this quote about operating
systems:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Somebody once said that if you compare operating
systems to hammers, Windows would be a colorful and pretty to look
at &ldquo;Fisher-Price&rdquo; type of hammer, while UNIX is perhaps not so
good-looking, but is a sturdy tool that gets the job done.</p></blockquote></div><p>Johan was and is interested in device driver development,
&ldquo;writing the PS/2 mouse driver and minor hacking in the keyboard
driver.&rdquo; He still does the maintenance needed for these drivers.
He adds,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In the early days, I also wanted to add support
for diacriticals in the keyboard driver, only to discover that
Linus had written the keyboard driver in assembly language. So the
first thing I did was convert the driver to C. This was a long time
ago, before we had loadable key maps.</p></blockquote></div><p>Asked about working with others over the Internet, Johan had
this to say:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It certainly has been exciting following how
Linux has developed over the years. I can understand the experts
were skeptical, because pulling through a software project this
large over the Net hadn't been tried yet. The Internet was a
revolution. Probably the skeptics had a traditional view of the
process, and didn't take into account the open nature of the
development process. Linux was this great job advertisement,
essentially saying: &ldquo;Just pick any task you find interesting. You
can start straight away.&rdquo; (Of course, you didn't get paid for
working on Linux.) Anybody could volunteer and jump in and work on
what was interesting&mdash;there was no bureaucracy. What further
boosted development was that, since nobody told who to do what,
there was some internal competition. You had to work hard if you
wanted to get your code into the kernel, before somebody else beat
you to it.
</p><p>Compare all this to the traditional software development
process with its managers, software engineers and testers, many
with an &ldquo;I just work here&rdquo; attitude. Now try to manage this with
your programmers scattered all around the world. The skeptics may
still be right...</p></blockquote></div><p>Johan Myreen can be reached at jem@iki.fi.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1766580.0x1deedc8"></a>Alessandro Rubini</h2></div></div><p>

also contributed a one-line patch to kernel 1.0.6 to increase

interest is in drivers.</p><p>A long-time author for <i  >LJ</i>, Alessandro's
first article for us appeared in the September 1995 issue (#17) and
dealt with writing mouse-sensitive applications. In the March 1996

Richard Stallman every year. He told me, &ldquo;If a package is not open
source, its author doesn't deserve any help from unpaid

proprietarization: &ldquo;the rise of products that are based on free

University of Aarhus in Denmark, when he saw Linus' first
announcement about Linux. At version 0.01, he felt Linux was
&ldquo;promising&rdquo;, and at 0.11, quite usable. But to run it himself,
Tommy needed support for his SCSI adapter, Adaptec 1542b, so he
wrote the initial driver for it&mdash;and was soon in the Linux
business.</p><p>When asked what Linux needed in order to succeed, and its
biggest threat, Tommy waxed eloquent. Here is his answer
verbatim:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Intellectual property (i.e., patents) is the
greatest threat to free (speech) software and Linux in particular.
In fact, I believe it is a threat to humanity.
</p><p>As a UNIX, Linux is already very good and steadily improving;
however, the UNIX model has it share of problems. For example, the
anarchical, disintegrated and inconsistent tradition of UNIX
configuration, and the fact that setting up devices requires a lot
of low-level knowledge and much manual intervention. Better tools
can patch the problem, but only a radical change will really
improve the situation. However, the thing about UNIX (and thus
Linux) that bothers me most is the security model, especially in
these Internet days of heavily interconnected machines. The
three-level permission model is grossly na&iuml;ve. Is it too much
to ask to be able to share permissions with a selected set of
users, to specify permissions on [an] object with common properties
instead of each individual file, to be able to launch subprocesses
with restricted rights, etc.? Other operating systems such as HURD,
L4, VSTa and EROS incorporate interesting solutions, and there has
been work on adding capabilities to Linux that holds some promise,
but we need some big changes, changes that I fear are too drastic
to ever be accepted into Linux. The first step is to agree upon the
problem.</p><p>For the desktop, user interface is really important. Gnome
and KDE have done much to make UNIX easier to use, but the
underlying model is still one of the flat file and the hierarchical
file system, which isn't necessarily what is best for users
(Anti-Mac, useit.com). In consequence, applications invent their
own, but mutually incompatible, richer model, such as the mailbox
formats, configuration file formats, etc. The result of this is the
lowest common denominator is the ASCII file with no semantic
content. Maybe XML will finally provide a path to richer files that
will allow applications to share data in a more intelligent manner,
but other issues remain, such as object replication, migration,
object and process persistence, cross reference, etc., that all
must be implemented on top. The challenge is to achieve this in a
consistent manner across all applications.</p><p>The area most likely to see innovation in user interface is
the embedded applications. This is a new domain for Linux, and it
calls for new solutions. As an example of the willingness to part
with tradition, part of the community has abandoned the X Window
System in favour of Microwindows, a new and smaller windowing
system written from scratch for embedded applications.</p></blockquote></div><p>Tommy Thorn can be reached via e-mail at

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4037f15.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Today, Jon Tombs is a professor at the University of
Seville's Engineering School in Spain and finds &ldquo;little time for
Linux.&rdquo; But in the beginning, he was involved mainly in X issues.
He relates it this way:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I worked on the CD-ROM code (Mitsumi driver), as
I had an unsupported Mitsumi single-speed CD-ROM. I worked on bits
of the NFS code, as I wanted to use Linux on the university
network. I worked on the Colorado FC10 floppy tape interface,
because I had one. I worked on kernel modules, as they allowed me
to work on the CD-ROM and FC10 drivers without rebooting. I was
also interested in accelerating graphics and the X Window System
(partly for xpilot and xblast gaming) and started compiling the
X386E Xserver for Linux. I was quite proud of the fact that for a
time, Linus was downloading my Xserver compile.
</p><p>I soon got involved with the XServer S3 support (together
with Amancio Hasty of the NetBSD band). He had good contacts within
S3 Inc., and during a conference in Denver, I managed to upgrade my
original S3 card for the latest unsupported card (S3 801).</p><p>This led to my involvement with the founding of the XFree86
Project, Inc., of which I am still a founding board member. I still
write applications from time to time, but my work schedule doesn't
allow me time to modify the kernel, unless I touch a bug that
annoys me. I still give support to students who work on Linux or
applications for Linux. EtherApe is a recent application by a
student of mine.</p></blockquote></div><p>He likes Linux best for its productive environment, saying,
&ldquo;Windows makes me feel [as if] I am computing with one arm tied
behind my back.&rdquo; He admits that knowing UNIX before MS-DOS
<span   class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> have warped his expectation, that a
computer should be &ldquo;a tool, not an application.&rdquo;</p><p>When asked if Linux should have stayed within the hacker
community, he told me:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I would have preferred that the non-hacker
community had stayed more disconnected from the hacker core. Many
hackers have been molested and insulted by the e-mails of &ldquo;dumb
users.&rdquo; On more than one occasion, this has prompted developers to
give up. The &ldquo;signal to noise&rdquo; feedback a developer receives
nowadays is much worse than it was. Hopefully, the distribution
vendors will in the future be the firewall between developers and
irate users.</p></blockquote></div><p>Jon Tombs can be reached via e-mail at

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4037f16.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Theodore Ts'o is another person who didn't get back to us,
but whom we know enough about to write something anyway. Ted is the
author and maintainer of the
<span   class="bold"><b>e2fsprogs</b></span> package, which contains
the EXT2 file-system utilities. He is one of the core Linux kernel
developers and serves on the technical board of Linux
International. He currently works for VA Linux Systems, but was a
long-time systems programmer for MIT before joining VA. He is much
sought after for his knowledge and lecturing abilities.</p><p>While at MIT, he headed the Kerberos development team, was a
member of the Internet Engineering Task Force and worked on the
Telnet Encryption Specifications. He took his degree in computer
science in 1990.</p><p>He is a fan of Gilbert and Sullivan and enjoys folk dancing,
ham radio, cooking and bicycling. More about Ted can be found at
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/tytso/www/home.html" target="_self">web.mit.edu/tytso/www/home.html</a>,
a site which includes a picture of him proving that &ldquo;playing with
a Van de Graph generator can be a shocking experience.&rdquo;</p><p>Other credits include authoring the serial driver, e2fsck,
job control and system call restart code, ramdisk device driver and
loopback device driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1766580.0x1df0108"></a>Fred van Kempen</h2></div></div><p>Fred admits he has &ldquo;made a lot of money off the Linux thing
and cannot say it feels bad.&rdquo; He is perhaps best known for selling
the Linux domain names&mdash;both Linux.com and Linux.net&mdash;although he
&ldquo;cannot share any details regarding those deals.&rdquo; He is also &ldquo;a
medium-to-large shareholder of some U.S. (Linux-related)
companies.&rdquo; There are critics who blast Fred for profiting from
Linux, but he has contributed heavily to the development of Linux.
The money issues are his business.</p><p>Fred thinks Linux belongs in the &ldquo;Big Bucks World ... where
decisions about future technologies are being made. Linux is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>there</em></span> now, and thus will be part of that
decision making.&rdquo; Adding money to Linux development is a good
thing, because developers &ldquo;can now be paid a decent salary to work
on Linux stuff.&rdquo; It's hard to argue with people enjoying their
work.</p><p>UNIX and Minix were Fred's first programming interests. He
relates,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I was a UNIX (2.9BSD, 2.11BSD, 4.2BSD and V7)
systems programmer already, playing with DEC PDP-11's at home. I
played a major role in the development of MINIX, and Linux was the
most natural next phase.</p></blockquote></div><p>He was introduced to Linux by a fellow MINIX developer,
Miquel van Smoorenburg, who urged him to try it. He did, and &ldquo;the
rest is history,&rdquo; Fred says, smiling.</p><p>His primary areas of focus on Linux were networking and the
high-performance/high-availability part. This work has continued,
as Fred works as a senior consultant for Nobel Van Dijk &amp;
Partners (the Netherlands). He works on &ldquo;big iron machines for
enterprise-level customers ... which means very large networks,
massive server parks and lots of Windows NT and Tru64 UNIX on FAT
Compaq servers.&rdquo; He holds most major certifications, and is
&ldquo;working&rdquo; toward his RHCE!</p><p>He would like to see Linux with more &ldquo;FAT server support&rdquo;.
He wants Linux to &ldquo;scream&rdquo; on big iron, believing it &ldquo;can
actually replace several <span   class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> UNIX systems
and/or Windows NT.&rdquo;</p><p>As for the desktop? &ldquo;The desktop means only one thing:
business applications. For many reasons, the business desktop means
supporting Microsoft <span   class="emphasis"><em>applications</em></span>.&rdquo; Fred
thinks that Linux, if it wants to be used for these things, &ldquo;will
have to at least resemble that desktop.&rdquo;</p><p>Outside work, Fred spends some days &ldquo;living the good life in
sunny Southern California with my fianc&eacute;e. Yes, there is
life outside of these things [computers]. Uhh ... I think. I've
been told stories about beaches, the ranch and kids.&rdquo;</p><p>Fred van Kempen can be reached via e-mail at

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4037f17.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Patrick put out one of the first distributions of
Linux&mdash;Slackware. For a long time, Slackware was the most-used
distribution available: if you were running Linux, odds were good
you were running Slackware. Like many others, Patrick became
involved with Linux as a university student studying UNIX, because
it was free and was compatible with his machine&mdash;386BSD was
not.</p><p>In those early days, Linux had a lot of bugs, and Patrick
found himself fixing a good many of them in his version&mdash;love
having that source. When he read Internet postings from others who
were having the same problems, he decided to make his changes
available to others on-line. Walnut Creek stepped in about this
time, and offered him archive space at their site. Eventually he
went to work for them, and they now sell the Slackware
distribution.</p><p>Patrick feels strongly about the Open Source movement, but
still thinks people should support whichever product is best,
whether it is free or commercial. He believes that in order for
Linux to continue to expand, it will need the support of both
sides. He also feels that making Linux easier for new people could
result in making it more complex, and he has no intention of
&ldquo;dumbing down&rdquo; Slackware only for it to end up on the desktops of
newbies who don't care how the system works, only that it does. He
says, &ldquo;I appreciate the simple elegance of UNIX. [Dumbing it down]
would spoil its flexibility.&rdquo;</p><p>When asked who he felt was the most influential person, other
than Linus, in the community today, Patrick replied,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I'd have to say Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall of Linux
International, because at a time when Linux seemed to be viewed as
a hacker product that couldn't really be trusted and didn't have
any centralization, he put a friendly and trustable face on the OS
and seemed to say all the right things to get the mainstream
computer world to start taking Linux seriously. He's also a master
at fostering cooperation and compromise among all the individual
groups working on Linux projects. I'm really glad we have someone
so level-headed representing the Linux community to the
mainstream.</p></blockquote></div><p>Patrick can be reached at volkerdi@slackware.com, and

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4037f18.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Matt Welsh is a very personable young man, who still looks
18&mdash;maybe because he's not much older than that. Matt is a very
busy man who enjoys traveling. He visited Nepal last December, and
you can see pictures of this trip on his web page at
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mdw" target="_self">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mdw/</a>.
He is an avid music lover who plays acoustic guitar and loves
jazz.</p><p>Currently, he is a Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, where he
just received his master's in December 1999. He is doing research
there involving &ldquo;scalable Internet service architectures with a
focus on implementing high-performance systems in Java. I am
affiliated with the Berkeley Ninja and Millennium
projects.&rdquo;</p><p>Matt is best known as the author of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Installation and Getting Started</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running
Linux</em></span>. He has also been the Linux Documentation Project
coordinator, the HOWTO coordinator and writer, the maintainer of
sunsite.unc.edu Linux documentation archives and the moderator of
comp.os.linux.announce.</p><p>We weren't able to get in touch with Matt. But since he has
written for us in the past and we hope he will find time to do so
again in the future, we wrote this for him. Most of it is true.

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4037f19.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Lars Wirzenius (such a fluid, melodic name) is Linus' friend
and was also a student at the University of Helsinki at the same
time Linus was. He remembers,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Linus showed me a program that had two threads
that wrote As and Bs, respectively, to the screen. That was the
beginning; it evolved into something more interesting later.</p></blockquote></div><p>If you are interested, more stories from the past nine years
can be found at
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/liw/texts/index.html" target="_self">www.iki.fi/liw/texts/index.html</a>#linux-anecdotes.</p><p>Most people know Lars through his efforts for the Linux
Documentation Project and as moderator for the
comp.os.linux.announce newsgroup. The only code he wrote that went
into the kernel was &ldquo;the part of the printk routine which prints
out messages to the console, more specifically, sprintf.&rdquo; Most of
his programming efforts have gone into applications, not the
kernel.</p><p>These days, he works for WapIT
(<a href="http://www.wapit.com" target="_self">http://www.wapit.com/</a>)
writing free software&mdash;everyone's dream job, right? Currently, his
work focuses on the &ldquo;WAP and SMS gateway called Kannel
(<a href="http://www.kannel.org" target="_self">http://www.kannel.org/</a>).&rdquo;
While he is still involved with the Debian project, maintaining
packages, he does not have as much time for this as he had in the
past. To counteract the stress of the job, he likes to &ldquo;relax by
having fun with friends, reading, watching movies and playing
role-playing games.&rdquo;</p><p>Lars is a very quotable guy. For example, consider the
following statements he made to us:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>I think the current popularity of Linux is very
nice indeed.</p></li><li><p>Commercialization is good, as long as co-operation
continues.</p></li><li><p>Proprietary file formats or protocols are really,
really bad.</p></li><li><p>Software freedom is important, even though I don't
require all software to be free.</p></li><li><p>Since I've been having lots of fun programming, I
can't ever feel that time has been wasted.</p></li></ul></div><p>Lars can be reached at liw@iki.fi.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1766580.0x1df3f20"></a>Rogier Wolff</h2></div></div><p>Rogier Wolff owns his own company, BitWizard, just so he can
work full-time on Linux. He is now in a position to reject work
that doesn't relate to Linux. He writes commercial Linux device
drivers and urges you to write him if you need a driver for a
special device.</p><p>When he first began working with Linux, he contributed fixes
and worked on the &ldquo;memory management system.&rdquo; He liked the fact
that his garbage-collecting code to fix memory fragmentation would
be incorporated into the Linux code base, unlike Minix development.
He has enjoyed working with others over the Internet and finds it
particularly rewarding to work with Alan Cox, as &ldquo;Alan is better
[than Linus] at giving short feedback about what's wrong with the
suggestion, allowing me to improve whatever I'm doing.&rdquo;</p><p>About the future of Linux, Rogier told us,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>For the future, Linux needs to be able to adapt
well to different situations. On an end-user workstation, wasting,
say, 1MB in unnecessary drivers is a convenience issue that is well
worth the RAM. It makes life easier for the end user, and RAM
doesn't cost that much. On an embedded application, Linux still
needs to be able to be configured for the minimal requirements that
apply there. On an enterprise server, you need to be able to
configure Linux to do well on a machine with lots of RAM and
CPUs.</p></blockquote></div><p>When asked how he felt about commercial software, he
replied,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Good&mdash;an operating system should provide a
platform. The free software idea is that when it's easy to
make/expand stuff, then the programs can be made available for
free. However, there will always be areas where significant
&ldquo;boring&rdquo; programming is required to make something work. People
will have to pay for that development. Companies should be allowed
to chose whatever system they think is appropriate for getting a
revenue stream from their products.</p></blockquote></div><p>He also feels that the reason Linux works so well is because
all code must be approved by a maintainer&mdash;Linus. This type of
license is good for other types of software as well, keeping the
patches from becoming incompatible.</p><p>Rogier Wolff can be reached at r.e.wolff@bitwizard.nl.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1766580.0x1df4340"></a>Eric Youngdale</h2></div></div><p>Eric became involved with Linux before the 1.0 kernel
release, and very much enjoyed the camaraderie among the various
developers. He found the Linux community to be friendly and
supportive of newcomers, as opposed to the BSD community that had a
&ldquo;tendency to argue, flame, and in general, eat their own
young&rdquo;.</p><p>During the day, Eric was a research scientist at the Naval
Research Lab in Washington, DC. At night, he worked on the kernel,
adding support for core files. Doing this work convinced him that
the a.out file format needed to be replaced, so he began working on
kernel support for ELF. He also did a lot of work on the linker,
assembler and dynamic loader. Later, he worked on writing an
iso9660 file system to handle CD-ROMs and on the SCSI subsystem.
These days, the SCSI subsystem is the only place he &ldquo;still sticks
[his] fingers.&rdquo;</p><p>When asked if there was a world outside computers, he
replied:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Absolutely, I have to frankly admit there are
times when I really resent the amount of time I spend on free
software, and these are the times when I completely stop reading
e-mail. In order to make the most of what limited time I have, I am
trying to be fairly selective about what I get involved with, and
really only work on things where there isn't anyone else taking a
leadership role. There are also times when things get quite intense
at work [so] that I don't have the interest or the energy to sit
down in front of my machine when I get home.</p></blockquote></div><p>His outside interests are many and varied, from roller hockey
to classes on reading, writing and speaking Chinese. He likes to
scuba dive and ski when he gets the chance and spend time near the
ocean in the summer.</p><p>Eric feels Linux wouldn't have been possible without the GNU
tools and that we owe the free software community a &ldquo;huge debt of
gratitude, but calling it GNU/Linux seems silly.&rdquo; Regarding
threats to Linux, he sees two: Windows NT and fragmentation. About
fragmentation, he said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The danger I see for Linux is all of the
different distributions that are appearing&mdash;there have to be close
to six different boxes down at CompUSA these days, and we are
already starting to see subtle differences in the way these things
work (KDE/GNOME is an example, here). I see no good that can come
out of having all of these different choices.</p></blockquote></div><p>Eric has many strong views and is not afraid to say things
that might not be agreed with by the majority&mdash;an excellent trait
in one of the leaders of our community. He can be reached by e-mail
