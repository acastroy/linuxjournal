    Scanning photos has never been easier.

<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span>, with the added option of
scanning in artwork. As a result, everything we discussed about xv
last month still holds true this month for
<span   class="bold"><b>xvscan</b></span>, including the fact that it
is commercial software. Licensing is $50 US per-installed computer.
So, a work group can install XVScan on the computer with the
scanner, and though everyone uses it, only one license is required
(site licenses available). To use, type <b  >xvscan</b>
on the command line. The familiar window with the red fish swimming
around appears, and clicking on the right mouse button brings up
the control window. Clicking on &ldquo;About XV&rdquo; will give you the
licensing information. The difference is seen when you click on
&ldquo;windows&rdquo;: there is now a scanner option. Click on &ldquo;scanner&rdquo;,
and the window shown in Figure 1 comes up.

Figure 1. Scanner Control Window
</p></div></div>

</p><p>The blank block under the words &ldquo;Scan Document...&rdquo;
represents the glass portion of your flatbed scanner. The outlined
portion is the area to be scanned; you can make this smaller or
larger, up to the full size of the glass. I will be scanning a
photograph placed at the top right-hand corner of the glass, so I
will start out by scanning just the upper portion. This will make
the scanning operation faster than it would be if I scanned the
entire bed. It's always a good idea to check the gamma-correction
button; otherwise, the picture will come out very dark. For the
first scan, I just want to determine the exact position of the
picture so I can crop it, so ordinarily, I would set the resolution
fairly low (the lower the resolution, the faster the scan) and
click on &ldquo;Quick Scan&rdquo;. The result of my quick scan is shown in
Figure 2; I kept the resolution high, so that the picture would be
printable.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4029f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Quick Scan
</p></div></div><p>As you can see, part of the scanner bed was scanned as well
as the picture. The area to be cropped is set in the same way as in
xv: click the left mouse button in the upper left corner, hold it
down while dragging to the bottom right corner, then release. Now
click on &ldquo;Apply Crop&rdquo;, and the lines delineating the scanning
area will decrease to the defined size. In this case, even with the
gamma correction set, the picture is still a bit dark, so I turned
off the gamma correction and set the contrast and brightness in
order to lighten it up. Since the picture will change each time you
change the values, I just played with different values until the
picture looked right. The numbers I ended up using were +17 for
contrast and +21 for brightness. I also clicked on the &ldquo;sharpen&rdquo;
option under algorithms and added a label, showing that this
picture of two of my granddaughters, Sarah and Rebecca, was taken
in 1995. The result of all this fiddling is shown in Figure
3.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4029f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 4. Control Window
</p></div></div><p>For a bit of fun, I clicked on the button in the far left
corner of the control window, the one that looks like a small
picture of a fish (see Figure 4). This brought up the xv pad window
shown in Figure 5. I had no idea what this would do, so for fun, I
set it to 50% blue, and the picture turned blue (see Figure
6)--surprise! Well, that certainly showed me what it would do; more
experienced photographers and artists would probably know how to
use this option to further enhance their pictures.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4029f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>So much for fun&mdash;that's about all you need to know to run
xvscan, once you've learned the basics using xv. The problem is
always what resolution to use for scanning. This, of course,
depends on how you intend to use the scan. To use it only on your
web site, there's no need to scan at any resolution higher than
72dpi, as that's as much as can be displayed on your screen.
Scanning at a higher resolution will result in a great big file
that will take a great deal of time to download, slowing down your
site, <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> it won't look any better.</p><p>If you are scanning for printing purposes, then you want to
use a much higher resolution. For photos we intend to print in the
magazine, we need 300dpi. So, if an author sends a picture that is
1x1.5 inches, we scan it at 300dpi, as 1x1.5 is the right size for
an author photo. On the other hand, book covers are printed at
about 2x3, so a 6x9-inch book needs to be scanned at only 100dpi to
get the right printing resolution; i.e., 600x900 divided by 300
gives 2x3. Again, we <span   class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> just scan
everything at 300dpi, but would then end up with huge files taking
up disk space, and they wouldn't print any better.</p><p>When you save, it is a good idea to check the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; box;
otherwise, the find graphic is smaller than you expect.</p><p>Now, you too can get rid of all those bulky photo albums.
Just get a Linux-supported scanner and XVScan, and scan away. Not
all Linux-supported scanners are supported by XVScan, only those
listed on thier web site at
<a href="http://www.tummy.com/xvscan/scanners.html" target="_self">www.tummy.com/xvscan/scanners.html</a>.
This includes all HP SCSI ScanJet scanners from the IIc to the most
recent ones, and two Microtek scanners (E3 and E6 no longer
available). Many more scanners are supported by SANE
(<a href="http://www.mostang.com/SANE" target="_self">http://www.mostang.com/SANE/</a>)
a free scanner driver that works with the GIMP.</p><p>Of course, when you run out of disk space, you'll need to get
a CD burner and write them to CD, but that's another Linux story.
