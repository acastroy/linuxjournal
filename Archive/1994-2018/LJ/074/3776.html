    You'll feel much better
    after reading about this new cross-platform toolkit written
    in Python and wrapped around wxWindows.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140b660"></a></h2></div></div><p>To many people in the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, MS
Windows is an inescapable, however unfortunate, fact of life. Some
of these people might even have clients or bosses who require a
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; Windows GUI application at the end of the day. For
many developers, being able to choose the best tool for the task at
hand, rather than being told which one to use, is an essential
element of their quality of life, and Linux is a pleasant
development environment.
</p><p>It is in fact now possible to do quality, rapid GUI
development for Windows on Linux, and is becoming increasingly
possible for other GUI systems as well, such as Apple Macintosh,
BeOS or OS/2. One of these tools, which I present in this article,
is wxPython, which is not only based upon a proven toolkit,
wxWindows, but uses our favorite language, Python.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140b7c0"></a>Portable GUI Toolkits</h2></div></div><p>There is no lack of choice of GUI development systems or
toolkits under Linux, and quite a few of them can be called
portable, i.e., work on at least two different platforms, for
example, Linux/UNIX+X11 and Windows. Many of them are free, but not
all of them are in usable form (i.e., documented, maintained,
relatively bug-free and feature-rich). However, we are fortunate
that such tools do exist. In fact, a well-maintained web page,
<a href="http://www.free-soft.org/guitool" target="_self">http://www.free-soft.org/guitool/</a>,
lists an impressive number of such toolkits. The problem is
deciding which one to choose, since life is too short to try them
all.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140b920"></a>How to Choose?</h2></div></div><p>Life is a series of compromises. Often, the problem is
finding out which set of drawbacks one is prepared to live with in
return for which benefits. For one of my projects, I finally
settled on the following list:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>compatible with Linux, Windows and Python</p></li><li><p>usable</p></li><li><p>large enough widget set</p></li><li><p>not too slow</p></li><li><p>compact</p></li><li><p>easy to learn</p></li><li><p>converts to C/C++ easily after prototyping stage,
if necessary</p></li><li><p>looks good</p></li></ul></div>

The last item was optional but &ldquo;nice&rdquo;. I found that wxPython fit
the bill remarkably well, as it is based on GTK. If your list of
constraints closely matches the above, you should give wxPython a
look.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140c000"></a>wxPython Qualities</h2></div></div><p>At the time of this writing, wxPython is in release 2.1.13.
Its author, Robin Dunn, has done a very good job of wrapping up
wxWindows, one of the classic C++ GUI tool kits that has been
around for several years. As a result of its relatively long
existence and popularity, wxWindows has been ported to a number of
toolkits and platforms and enjoys a relatively large widget
collection. For Linux, the version of wxWindows that wxPython uses
is wxGTK, the wxWindows interface to the GTK. For windows, the
wxWindows port to win32 was used.
</p><p>The interface of wxWindows to Python is remarkably
transparent. The concepts are the same and the naming conventions
are mostly the same. The object-oriented nature of the toolkit has
been preserved. If you know how to program in C++ with wxWindows,
you will have no problem with wxPython. Conversely, if you have a
working proof of concept in wxPython, porting all or part of it to
C++ for better speed should be straightforward.</p><p>wxPython is quite compact, but doesn't come with the standard
Python distribution. See the Resources section on where to get the
software. I found wxPython easy to learn; the distribution comes
with a huge series of helpful demos which I will use in
examples.</p><p>All of wxPython is open source, so people can contribute and
fix bugs. In general, the software quality is high.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140c210"></a>wxPython Drawbacks</h2></div></div><p>For all its qualities, wxPython does have a few minor
drawbacks. As of this writing, the wrapping of wxWindows is not
complete, but Robin Dunn and others are working on finishing up.
</p><p>The documentation is both very complete and almost
non-existent. Robin can get away with this because wxPython is so
similar to wxWindows that the wxWindows documentation, which is
quite good and complete, can be used instead. The Python-specific
part of the documentation is reduced to a small number of notes
within the text (if a feature is not available or slightly
different, for example) and a small section toward the end of the
documentation. It is hardly any effort to do the mental translation
from C++-type calls to Python, but if you've never seen C++ code in
your life, this can be seriously off-putting.</p><p>The product is still very much in development. It follows
wxGTK quite closely, but the wxGTK version it is based on is an
unstable, development version. This means a number of things may
not work perfectly, and things are likely to change a lot from
version to version. I've had a lot of problems with printing under
Linux, whereas it works perfectly under Windows.</p><p>wxPython would probably benefit greatly from a step-by-step
tutorial. By the time you read this, someone will most likely have
written one.</p><p>An interactive GUI-building tool would also be of interest. I
understand that reusing the one from wxWindows should become
possible soon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140c478"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>The installation of wxPython is fairly straightforward if you
have a Debian or an RPM-based system, as Robin Dunn provides both
of these packages on his web page at
<a href="http://wxpython.org" target="_self">http://wxpython.org/</a>.
You'll need wxGTK installed (again, a package is provided) as well
as Mesa-3.0.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140c5d8"></a>Examples</h2></div></div><p>We are now going to look at some simple wxPython examples.
The intention is not to offer a tutorial but to get a feel for the
way wxPython can be used.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x140c6e0"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>The obligatory &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; application is shown in
Listing 1. A fixed-size frame is created at line 14. A panel is
attached to the frame at line 18, and within the panel, a static
text area displaying &ldquo;Hello world of wxPython&rdquo; in the default
font is created in lines 19-20. The application subclass definition
is shown on lines 23-32. An instance of our frame is created, shown
and brought to the foreground. If these definitions are run
stand-alone, rather than being imported in another application, an
instance of an application class is defined and run in lines 36-37.
</p><p><a href="3776l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>Note the systematic use of the object-oriented framework even
in this very simple example. The frame and the application are
subclasses of the pre-defined classes. We need to redefine only the
methods we use to get our program working. A screen shot of this
impressive application is shown in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3776f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. ScreenShot of the &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; Application
</p></div></div><p>One might say that about 40 lines of code is too many for a
simple application that basically does nothing. In fact, you could
probably cut this down to a few lines, but the goal is to present a
relatively well-structured piece of code which is easy to build
upon.</p><p>There are many function calls with <b  >-1</b>
given as second argument, such as <b  >panel =
wxPanel</b>(<b  >self, -1</b>). In these cases, the
value of <b  >-1</b> is a mandatory numerical identifier
for the object being created, which is used when connecting widgets
together, as we will see in the second example. A value of
<b  >-1</b> means &ldquo;default&rdquo; and is useful when this
object ID will not be used anywhere in the code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x14035a0"></a>Slightly More Complicated Example</h2></div></div><p>In the previous example, the position of the widget in the
window was fixed, and we had no control over the application other
than through the window manager: no menu, no exit button, etc.
Moreover, getting the &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; message is a bit boring, so
here's an application that does more and is much longer. The
application is shown in Listing 2. In this second example, the
structure of the program is essentially the same: we have a
subclassed <span   class="bold"><b>Frame</b></span> and a subclassed
<span   class="bold"><b>Application</b></span>. The subclassed Frame
redefines the <span   class="bold"><b>__init__</b></span> function.
In the redefined __init__, we define a few more interesting
messages than &ldquo;hello&rdquo; on line 13-18, a counting variable on line
19, a menu table on lines 20-25. As before, we call the parent's
__init__ function on line 27, create a panel on line 30, some
static text field on line 31 and a button on line 34. Lines 36-43
are devoted to the layout of the main part of the window.
Basically, we have the static text in a fixed position; underneath
it is a button, at the bottom of the window, that remains centered
with respect to the right and left part of the window, no matter
how wide the window is. This is done using a number of
<span   class="bold"><b>wxBoxSizer</b></span> objects. On line 45, we
associate a button event between the button defined on line 42 and
the <span   class="bold"><b>OnButtonClick</b></span> method defined
on line 69. This method will be called when the button is pressed.
</p><p><a href="3776l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a></p><p>On line 47, we associate the application close event with the
<span   class="bold"><b>OnCloseWindow</b></span> method, defined on
line 76. Using this method, we build a quick message dialog box to
ask the user for confirmation. On lines 48-64, we create a status
line where the menu tool tips will be displayed. The main menu of
applications is defined by the specs in
<span   class="bold"><b>myMenuTable</b></span>, lines 20-25. Note
that the &ldquo;New&rdquo; menu item will also call the method of line 81. In
the definition of the menu items (lines 24-29), the character &amp;
before a letter indicates a keyboard shortcut (typing
<b  >ALT</b> + the letter calls the menu item).</p><p>On lines 65-67, we make the window layout fit together and
set the autofit feature of the wxBoxSizer objects &ldquo;on&rdquo;. Lines
69-72 define the callback method from both the menu item and the
button. This method simply redefines the text content of the static
text object defined on line 31. Pressing the button multiple times
shows the strings defined in
<span   class="bold"><b>self.myFortunes</b></span>, line 13-18, in
succession. The method of lines 87-88 is called from the &ldquo;Exit&rdquo;
menu item and invokes the <span   class="bold"><b>Close</b></span>
event, which will close the application. Lines 90-106 are identical
to the &ldquo;hello&rdquo; example. A screen shot of this application is
shown in Figure 2.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3776f2.large.jpg"><img src="3776f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. ScreenShots of the &ldquo;Cookie&rdquo; Application on Linux (a)
and Windows (b)
</p></div></div><p>The more interesting points of this &ldquo;toy&rdquo; application are
how window layout can be achieved (using wxBoxSizer) and how events
and widgets are connected (using
<span   class="bold"><b>EVT_MENU</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>EVT_BUTTON</b></span> in this case). In fact,
as it is, only the layout of the button is satisfactory; the main
text is still in a fixed position&mdash;a complete solution would be too
long to show here.</p><p>Note the use of the
<b  >self.<i><tt>something</tt></i></b>
variables. If a variable is to be accessed across methods, it must
be called in this way (<b  >self</b> being the object
instance). If a variable is private to a method, the
<b  >self</b> prefix is not necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x1403ff0"></a>Where to Go Next?</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned above, a complete tutorial to wxPython is not
ready yet, although one is on its way. Nearly all the widgets
supported by wxPython are demonstrated in the demo application that
comes with the distribution. Since the examples are concise and to
the point, it is possible to learn from them fairly quickly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1313580.0x14040f8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>At the moment, we are enjoying a growing array of usable tool
kits, and I feel wxPython is one of the better ones. Like most
things written in Python, programs in wxPython tend to be compact,
easy-to-read and maintain and powerful. The range of available
widgets doesn't match MFCs (Microsoft foundation classes), but is
adequate for most applications. I personally find that this
particular tool kit makes the RAD (rapid application development)
concept finally available to Linux. The fact that applications
written in this framework also work on Windows will be a tremendous
benefit for some.</p><p>As it stands, wxPython probably cannot replace Tkinter as the
default Python GUI tool, at least not until the Apple Macintosh
port of wxWindows is completed and a stable release is made. But it
shows a lot of promise, as being a much higher-level
toolkit.</p><p><a href="3776s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3776s2.html" target="_self">Credits</a></p></div></div>
