any publisher on the subject of programming the Perl DBI, and its
authors are imminently qualified to write it. Tim Bunce wrote the
DBI Perl module, and also the DBD Oracle module. Alligator
Descartes, who originally began working on the book, is a leading
Perl/DBI exponent in the Oracle community. The authors have been
working on the Perl interface to relational databases, and
documentation thereof, since 1992. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming the Perl
DBI</em></span> is not merely a republication of older
documentation. A great deal of new material is here, not all of it
about DBI.</p><p>The book starts out very simply, describing how even a flat
file like /etc/passwd can be a bona fide database. The authors
progress logically to more complex data models by addressing the
shortcomings of the simpler models. After flat files, the book
covers DBM and the Berkeley Database Manager, again noting the
details of use, pros, cons and applications where this type of
database is best used. A chapter on SQL and relational databases is
included as a primer for those who are new to the material.</p><p>Three chapters deal with the theory and practice of using DBI
to interact with various relational database engines. One chapter
is devoted to ODBC. Every DBI method is described in detail and
illustrated with at least one code example. There is also a chapter
on DBISH, the DBI shell, wherein one can interactively give
commands to the database after the manner of Oracle's SQLPlus. This
tool will be valuable during development of database
programs.</p><p>The book includes a description of a complex relational model
where Microsoft clients access UNIX servers and vice versa over a
network, with data encrypted via software.</p><p>The appendices contain a complete DBI specification, and
specific information for each of the major relational
engines.</p><p>The authors assume the readers have significant fluency with
Perl, including installation and use of Perl modules and Perl's
object-oriented syntax. Although the code examples are short,
numerous and well-documented, readers new to Perl may need a Perl
reference as they go through the code.</p><p>As a one-source database reference, the book is essentially
complete. Detailed treatment is given to the DBI/DBD concept where
each database engine has a unique driver (DBD), and a DBI
superlayer that provides transparency to the engine below. All of
the DBI methods are covered in detail, so the reader is able to
select methods appropriate to his or her programming tasks. The
authors are especially thorough in their treatment of debugging
levels, error trapping and error interpretation.</p><p>They state that DBI is very much a work in progress and
envision it to be a full-featured product soon, on par with any
commercial development product available.</p><p>I noticed only two minor typos in the entire book. This was
quite refreshing to me, as I have read computer books containing so
many errors as to be virtually useless.</p><p>Anyone who works with data will find this book useful. And
the more closely one works with relational databases and the
programs which access that data, the more useful it will be.</p></div></div>
