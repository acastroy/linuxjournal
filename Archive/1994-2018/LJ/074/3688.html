While TCP/IP, Internet routing and Ethernet are well-covered
topics, the telcommunications network that connects the Internet to
other data networks, public and private, and to individual
organizations and networks is often overlooked.</p><p>Many of us use dial-up networking, dedicated circuits (T1,
DS3) and DSL on a daily basis, but it's not often that Linux users
and system administrators are exposed to the physical or network
layers of telecommunications systems. In fact, we're often forced
to rely on ISP help desks and specialized phone company personnel
who rarely grasp the big picture and are armed with only
troubleshooting checklists. This book would make a good reference
for any hobbyist or professional who needs to understand these
technologies on a more fundamental level, although it might not be
the best choice for casual readers.</p><p>Billed as an in-depth discussion of data communications
presented in a way that is &ldquo;understandable for students who have a
limited mathematical background&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Data and
Telecommunications</em></span> covers concepts behind analog and
digital communications and the way they have been applied to
telecommunications systems and data networks. Thurwachter begins
with a concise introduction to the topic, after which he covers
electromagnetic signals, metallic (copper) and optical (fiber)
media and antennas. These chapters, like most of the book, take an
academic approach to their topics. Because of this, I think many
readers will find the book a bit inaccessible.</p><p>After covering the basics, Thurwachter launches into a fairly
academic discussion of signal and fourier analysis, and amplitude,
angle and pulse modulation and demodulation. Although the book
prides itself on non-mathematical discussions of the topic, I found
that mathematical concepts had not been replaced with thorough
real-world analogies and clear high-level explanations.</p><p>Chapter 11 (multiplexing) will likely have the biggest appeal
to readers who come from UNIX and TCP/IP-based networking
backgrounds. It covers channelized T1 and DS3 circuits, as well as
signaling associated with these circuits. Thurwachter follows with
coverage of error correction and digital modulation.</p><p>Chapters 14 and 15 attempt to cover the OSI model and
networking hardware. These chapters are better covered by
Tannenbaum and Stevens and are clearly written for an audience
without any networking experience. Chapter 16 on telecommunications
thoroughly covers the details of phone-switching equipment and call
routing, but it lacks a practical discussion of the topic. For
example, in a discussion of 2-wire vs. 4-wire circuits, no mention
of T1 being a common 4-wire circuit is made, despite the fact that
it is a widely deployed communication link.</p><p>The book finishes with a brief discussion of networking
protocols, but like earlier chapters, this topic is covered more
thoroughly and with better clarity in other texts. While there is
some good information in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Data and
Telecommunications</em></span>, it's hard to find it in the middle
of a book meant for students. Because of its hefty price, this book
probably won't make a good addition to home libraries. But since it
does contain some useful, hard-to-find information, I'd recommend
buying a copy for the office and passing it around.</p></div></div>
