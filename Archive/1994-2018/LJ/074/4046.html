exists; and to such a place I went, and back from such a place I am
to yield a report to such readers as subscribe to a computer
magazine about a kernel and its operating system. Yes, I have been
to the Game Developers Conference 2000 in San Jose, and I have such
news as has not been reported in this column for a long time. In
fact, since I don't usually cover commercial software, such news
has never been reported here. Alas, variety is more than just the
spice of life&mdash;it's also a reproductive advantage, so if we want to
reproduce computer games, we'll have to learn how to crack them.
Actually, that's one of the many things that has changed since I
last visited commercial games. It seems the sheer size of the
software is the best copy-restriction scheme of the day. No longer
have we any clever challenges to break (and let's just say it was
more fun cracking a game to look at its code and make it do funny
things than it was to be able to copy it. As a kid, I used to
rewrite dungeon adventure games in skater lingo). Many things have
changed, and it is with a heart not quite as heavy as a heavy
heart, yet not quite light as a light heart, that I report the
findings of my undercover operation.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4046f1.jpg"></div>

</p><p>First of all, video game development is a serious industry.
It's like the movie industry, except it isn't suing everyone on the
Net. There's a struggle for the teenage mind and dollar, and the
gaming racket is not so much about creativity as it once was, it's
not about a single developer sitting in his bedroom churning out
the latest big hit. Producing a video game is probably more
difficult than producing a film, and there's a whole infrastructure
built up to support the gaming industry, which brings me to my next
point.</p><p>Video game development requires infrastructure, not just the
infrastructure within the computers themselves that lets game
developers have easy and uniform access to the video display, sound
card and I/O devices (an infrastructure which we need to develop),
but an actual support system within the industry to supply graphics
engines, 3-D rendering tools and development kits. You may have
noticed that modern games tend to be 3-D remakes of the Quake
variety. Well, in order to produce the graphics for these games,
developers have to use special graphics packages to develop 3-D
models. Then, they quite often buy someone else's graphics engine
to use. Some people at the convention were even trying to sell
audio samples.</p><p>Another thing to know about the gaming industry is that it
doesn't pay like a job at Microsoft. The top few games take up
nearly the whole market, and everyone else is a tad out of luck.
Now, creative people like Sid Meier and Richard Garriot who
consistently make enormous hits aren't starving in the streets, but
they aren't as wealthy as Bill, Paul and Steve, either. Why is
gaming industry pay important? Because they're recruiting.</p><p>Yes, we coders are in demand, at least right now, and the
video game industry has to be one of the most interesting areas to
work in. At the moment, I don't do the &ldquo;proprietary thing&rdquo;, so
it's mostly off limits to me unless I change my mind someday. But,
if you want a fun place to work where you can exercise creativity,
be aware the video gaming industry is hiring (pre-IPO with stock
options, even).</p><p>Computer games can seem stupid, especially the new rash of
boring 3-D killers, but they've vital to the success of computers.
They attract future hackers, this is true, but their real value is
that they drive the hardware industry. Of course, Microsoft's
bloated OS also forces people to keep buying bigger and faster
machines, but the main driver of progress (or so I choose to
believe) is video games. Graphics cards, sound cards,
processors&mdash;the more people buy games, the more these technologies
are driven; in the end, we win.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4046f2.jpg"></div><p>What's new on the proprietary front? Well, if you haven't
played modern games in a while, you might be impressed by the state
of current production quality. However, if you have, you might be
bored with all the bloody 3-D shooters. I didn't see any games that
demonstrated truly new ideas, but at least the developers are
getting better at implementing the old ones.</p><p>For GNU/Linux, I can say that Loki is our best hope right
now. With seven releases so far and <span   class="emphasis"><em>twenty</em></span>
scheduled this year, don't go back to dual-booting; there are more
games on the way, and they're going to sound better, too. Loki is
spearheading the OpenAL project, which is a cross-platform 3D audio
library, essentially the OpenGL of audio. It's LGPL (lesser GPL, as
it is now called), meaning that even though it is guaranteed to be
free, you can use it to make things that aren't. It's a pragmatic
approach, if we want it to be accepted in the hyper-commercial
industry. Check out
<a href="http://www.openal.org" target="_self">http://www.openal.org/</a>
if you're interested in this project.</p><p>One thing holding back video game development on Linux is the
lack of internal infrastructure. The multi-tasking, multi-user
nature of our OS presents a slew of trouble when one user wants to
play a game that needs access to the frame buffer, audio device and
I/O ports, as well as some assurance of soft real-time performance.
How do we avoid resource conflicts? How do we give programmers a
consistent way to talk more-or-less directly to the frame buffer or
the digital signal processor? And, how do we solve the latency
problems? Fortunately, these questions are being forcibly answered
by the imposition of demanding games. Once the infrastructure is
there, we can expect easier development of both free and
proprietary wares for GNU/Linux.</p><p>Didier Malenfant brought another ray of hope. Already quite a
successful game programmer (with a legacy from the Amiga demo
scene), he gave a presentation for developers interested in
developing games that are easily portable to Linux. As long as
developers start with several platforms in mind, they won't
encounter much trouble porting later on. I spent much of my time at
the show trying to explain the details to numerous intrigued
developers, so I have a feeling we've planted the memes pretty
successfully. In fact, the ideal of many developers is to be able
to work under Linux and then cross compile to other platforms. Jon
Taylor of Crack.com considered Linux the ultimate development
platform, a sentiment I'm sure nearly all of us share.</p><p>Hardware news? Well, as you know, the Amiga is coming back
again, this time hopefully for real. It is rumored to be on a Linux
base, but then we've been living on rumors long enough to build a
whole new operating system. Microsoft announced their XBox, and
several Microsofties got quite haughty with me when I offered them
a free <i  >Linux Journal</i>, so I perceive less than
good karma in the air surrounding that outfit.</p><p>As for the future of video gaming, some people expected
computer gaming to be completely replaced by consoles, others
thought the two would coexist without trouble, and still many
thought that console and computers would offer different kinds of
games. Personally, I can't understand the value of a gaming box if
you can't hack it, so I hope they don't get too popular.</p><p>Surprise, surprise&mdash;more things work on Linux than we know.
Of course, I've been asked by certain firms to keep silent about
what exactly it is that works, but let's just say the industry has
noticed our little OS project, and a lot of software is either
being ported or has been ported and is now sitting around going
stale. This is one more reason I suspect if we get our audio and
video acts together, the gaming industry on Linux will be ready to
take off.</p><p>Anything special to watch out for? Well, I saw some demos
from Aegis Simulation Technologies (creators of the graphically
impressive BFRIS), one of which will come out soon and looked neat,
and another which is being delayed and looks fantastic. The
projects are still under wraps, but keep on the lookout: if you're
into gaming and don't mind the proprietary thing, you probably
won't want to miss these. Now, enough with the proprietary bit and
on to free software, since that's what we're all about, no matter
how often we may forget.</p><p>Bertrand Meyer, in his criticism of the ethics of free
software, said that commercial software gave a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo;
that free software then copied. So my question would be, what can
free game developers learn from the commercial video gaming
industry? Well, we need an infrastructure, both externally in terms
of ultra-powerful libraries, rendering tools and development kits,
and internally by resolving once and for all how we can reconcile
real-time multimedia with a multi-tasking, multi-user OS. I imagine
there are a million more-informed opinions than mine floating
around, but I shall meander nonetheless! Nothing beats
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> for a development tool, and
the OpenGL/MesaGL libraries seem quite easy to use. As for
rendering tools, hopefully Blue Moon, renderman, GNU's Panorama and
PMR will keep progressing. It seems as though virtual reality and
artificial intelligence, those trendy business ventures of the 80s
which left craters all over Silicon Valley, are finally coming
back, so for VR we'll really depend on 3-D engines and rendering
tools. As for AI, I wonder if NPCs (non-player characters) can be
written in LISP, and does this mean I can use it again? Video game
development is so interesting; it would be nice if we were able to
develop for free, share our libraries, and not have to reinvent the
wheel with massive production teams every time around. I wonder if
we will see the day when a single programmer, or a handful of close
friends (Cathedral alert!), working only with software released
under the GPL, could spit out a truly creative masterpiece on a par
with the best of the commercial offerings. One would hope.</p></div></div>

      <span   class="bold"><b>Jason Kroll</b></span>
            (info@linuxjournal.com) suspects the ability to create a world in our own
