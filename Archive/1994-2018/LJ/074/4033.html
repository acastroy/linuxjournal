connects to hub, which connects to 675, which connects to the DSL
carrier. I put a Win95 machine in parallel (it also connects to
hub) and it connects fine to the DSL's DNS and the Linux machine.
The Linux machine sees the Win95 machine and also the 675 router's
IP. The Linux machine does not see beyond the router (the Cisco
675) to the DNS, nor can the Web connect to it, though it should be
able to using static IPs. I think this is an issue with this router
and Linux; in the documentation there is a note: &ldquo;must have
termcap database installed on Linux or Cisco 675 may not work
correctly.&rdquo; I do have termcap installed (I did a full SuSE
install). Do I have to &ldquo;run&rdquo; termcap somehow, as an executable
program, even though it is &ldquo;installed&rdquo;? (I tried to
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> the termcap.rpm and it said
&ldquo;already installed&rdquo;.) Or is termcap already running
automatically?</p><p>Cisco was kind enough to tell me they have a contract with
USWest which precludes them from customer support for the 675. The
quote in full from the Cisco manual: &ldquo;Computers running Linux
without the term/termcap database installed will have trouble
connecting to Cisco equipment. The message BAD ADDRESS is sometimes
displayed as an error message. The user can install the
term/termcap database from his Linux install disks/CD.&rdquo;--Scott
Cameron, lscott11@uswest.net</p><p>It sounds as if your network setup on the Linux machine is
missing a default router (or gateway) in the configuration. If you
type <b  >route -n</b>, you will see a list of the
routing table that the kernel maintains. The default route is the
one the kernel will choose for network packets in the event no
other paths are possible to the destination. In addition to having
a default route, you will also need to have DNS set up properly or
you won't be able to resolve domain names into IP addresses, which
is how network communication happens. Thus, if you can ping the IP
address of your DSL router and no further, then it is likely you
are missing a default route. If you have a default route defined
(it should be the 675 router) and you are unable to ping a site
such as www.linux.org, then DNS is probably not configured
properly. About the termcap statement: termcap is a library that
provides a database of the terminal capabilities of various
terminal emulations. It is not required to use the 675 for
networking purposes. However, if you need to access the embedded
operating system on the router, you can telnet to it (or use a
direct serial connection&mdash;I'm guessing because I have never seen a
675) and access its built-in features. This is where the termcap
would be required, as it will use some type of terminal emulation
for which your terminal will need to know the mappings for what the
character sequences do. So, it is necessary only if you intend to
log in to the router and change the settings.  &mdash;Andy Bradford,

<i  >LJ</i> subscription and have purchased several
informative books. I've installed Linux on my C drive along with
Windows 98. My Linux version is Red Hat 6.0. It loaded LILO to
provide direction to Linux and W98. Now I wish to install DOS. One
of your recent issues provided information on how LILO is to be
modified, but not on how to access LILO or where it is located.
Frankly, I am confused. On one recent attempt to load Linux, which
I aborted, I discovered that LILO was not erased, even when I
completely reformatted the Linux partition. So, how do I find the
LILO program to change it so DOS can be included?  &mdash;B.E. (Gene)
Johnson, gene-bj075@msn.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>LILO is configured through the /etc/lilo.conf file.
Actually, if you install Linux on a PC that already has Windows 98,
you should first have enough space on your disk(s) to hold Linux.
You need to defragment the Windows disk, then you may have to
repartition it. There is a utility called FIPS on your Linux CD
which allows repartitioning a disk without reformatting.</em></span>
Use with extreme care! You have to create one Windows partition
(holding whatever you have on Windows now) and the rest of the
disk; the second partition will be for Linux. Afterward, when the
Linux installation procedure is running, you can partition the
Linux area of the disk into the boot, root and swap partitions at a
minimum to install and configure Linux correctly. When you
reformatted the Linux partition, LILO appeared to you as not being
erased, because what was left intact after reformatting is the
disk's boot sector, which contains Linux's boot loader. To get rid
of that, use the Windows (or MS-DOS) FDISK with /MBR as an
argument, e.g., <b  >A:&gt;FDISK&nbsp;/MBR</b>. This will
reinstall the normal WIN/DOS boot loader.  &mdash;Felipe Barousse,
fbarousse@piensa.com</p><p>The lilo boot code can reside in different places. It can be
on your MBR (Master Boot Record), which is the most common
configuration, or it can also be in the boot sector of some primary
partition if it's flagged as active. To configure lilo, edit
/etc/lilo.conf. On my machine, I can boot DOS with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
other=/dev/sda1
        label=dos
        table=/dev/sda
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>After that, rerun
</em></span><span   class="bold"><b>lilo</b></span>. To uninstall
lilo, <b  >lilo -u /dev/device</b> should do, or you can
also type <b  >fdisk /mbr</b> from a DOS boot floppy. In
/usr/doc/lilo-0.21/ (or a similar directory), you should have a
file called QuickInst. For many more details, it also has a
README.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com

question. I am using a 19-inch monitor, with a Stealth IIIs540
Diamond card. I have gotten Linux up, but I seem to be using the
wrong screen resolution. It appears kind of bowed out at the edges.
How can I change this?  &mdash;Virgil Denny,
freeagain@earthlink.net</p><p>If the text and window size look good to you, but just the
edges are curvy, chances are you're running at the right
resolution, but have some monitor or display attributes to change.
Most monitors have controls at the bottom of the unit that allow
you to change the width, height, color, angle, and even the convex
and concave curves of your display. Try to use this to correct your
problem first. If this doesn't resolve your problem, there is a
program called <span   class="bold"><b>xvidtune</b></span> that
allows you to adjust these qualities as well. If you do decide to
play with xvidtune, make sure to click the auto button first. That
will allow you to automatically see the changes you're making when
you click various buttons. If you have indeed decided your
resolution is not right, one of the most user friendly methods to
changing your X (and other) configurations is XF86Setup. Get it
installed if you don't have it already, you'll be glad you
did.  &mdash;Kara Pritchard, kara@linux.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x124d580.0x13459d0"></a>Driving Miss Printer</h2></div></div><p>I need two drivers, one for a HP DeskJet 712C printer and one
for a Umax Astra 1220P scanner. I do not understand why they are
not supported by my distribution; this one is brand-new. Those
drivers should be quite easy to install. I could not find them on
any site, had no response from the newsgroups and do not know
anybody who can help me.  &mdash;Marc Nadeau,
cerceaux@francimel.com</p><p>Something commonly confused by new Linux users is the
difference between driver behavior in Linux and other operating
systems. For your printer, either run
<span   class="bold"><b>control-panel</b></span> and click on the
printer tool, or run <span   class="bold"><b>printtool</b></span>
directly (from Red Hat). You can then choose the driver for the
series closest to yours (e.g., HP DeskJet 6xxC series) and your
printer should work fine. To configure your scanner, visit
<a href="http://www.mostang.com/sane" target="_self">http://www.mostang.com/sane/</a>
. That is the web site for SANE, Scanner Access Now Easy. SANE is a
universal scanner interface, and their supported scanners page
lists multiple Umax Astra scanners that are supported.  &mdash;Kara

Sendmail. At this stage, it is just the mail server for the company
network. All the other workstations are Windows machines using
Outlook Express. I have set up the clients to use the Linux machine
as their SMTP and POP3 server. When a user sends mail to another
user, the message gets sent fine. Now, instead of the e-mail going
to /var/spool/mail/John, for example, the e-mail goes to
/var/spool/mail/root. When I read the e-mail in root's mail, it
says both the sender and the receiver are named Unknown. I have set
up user accounts successfully. How do I get the server to accept
mail for each user and to recognize the users? My POP is working,
as I am able to use <span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span>
successfully with POP, but I cannot get POP-3 to work properly.
When I type <b  >telnet&nbsp;localhost&nbsp;pop-3</b>, it
says:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Trying 127.0.0.1
Connected to localhost Escape character is ' ^ ] '.
</pre><p>then after about five seconds on its own, it says,
<pre     class="programlisting">
 ...Connection closed by foreign host...
</pre>


Where does the Linux server store the user's mail? When a user
tries to retrieve their mail, nothing is coming through. How do I
configure the server to direct the mail to the user's local
machine?  &mdash;Mark Wainman, wainman@iafrica.com
</p><p>A user's mail, after it has been received by Sendmail and
(most of the time) processed through
<span   class="bold"><b>procmail</b></span>, is stored in
/var/spool/mail/userid where &ldquo;userid&rdquo; is the login user name.
When retrieving mail with POP, mail is read from that location and
transferred to the user's home directory, appending the message to
the file <b  >mbox</b>. POP actually reads the mail from
mbox in the user's home directory. If your user's PCs are on a LAN,
you must properly configure your e-mail clients (Outlook Express)
to use SMTP for outgoing mails and POP for incoming ones. The user
name and password must be correctly set up for remotely logging in
to the Linux machine. Maybe it is worth mentioning that you need to
have the POP service installed through the IMAP RPM on a Red Hat
system. Also, it has to be enabled; that is, the POP-3 lines should
not be commented out in /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf. If this
is correctly set, you should be able to retrieve mail from the
server from the PCs. For Internet e-mail from the PCs through the
server, Sendmail has to be correctly configured as well according
to your external connection parameters. I think you may have a
setup problem with your domains. The Linux box may not be able to
find local users due to incorrect configuration of Sendmail,
specifically in relation to <b  >localhostname</b> and
<b  >localdomain</b>. Check the file /etc/sendmail.cw and
put in the local domain name, for example &ldquo;yourcompany.com&rdquo;, and
make sure the Linux machine is named after that, e.g.,
serverpc.yourcompany.com.  &mdash;Felipe Barousse,
