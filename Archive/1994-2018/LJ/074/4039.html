Conference Program in Sydney (Letters, April 2000) struck a chord
with me, and I decided to answer the letter.</p><p>First of all, I will mention that this was my third trip to
Australia in the past twelve months, where I have given talks at
much-lower-priced venues, such as CALU and AUUG, as well as free
talks to various user groups in Australia.</p><p>The $1350 AUS price quoted by Laurie in the letter was the
price for both the Linux conference and the ASPCON conference. The
Linux conference by itself was $695 AUS, with a Government/Academic
discount of 10% <span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> an active LUG member being
able to get in for $595 AUS. The dinner price was correct as stated
at $125, but again I would like to point out for our non-Australian
readers that this was $125 AUS and not 125 USD. Since USD were
trading for 1.82 AUSD that day, it means the dinner really cost
about 68 USD, not an unreasonable price for a dinner in
Sydney.</p><p>Nevertheless, I was a bit upset to hear the dinner price was
even that high, and I spoke to the organizers about it. They
assured me that the dinner was a &ldquo;break-even&rdquo; event. I can
imagine that, since the Sydney Linux User's Group tried to rent a
room for a four-hour meeting in the same facility, and were charged
$500 AUS (274 USD) for the privilege of having a room and chairs.
This $500 AUS charge was picked up by LinuxCare, much to the relief
of the SLUG.</p><p>Still not completely mollified by the explanation, I
proceeded to put on five more one-hour talks over the next three
days of the exhibition, at the small theaters in the Red Hat,
LinuxCare and SuSE booths. These talks were free of charge, and
were well received by the people who attended. Other &ldquo;luminaries&rdquo;
such as Bob Young, Dr. Andrew Tridgell, Paul &ldquo;Rusty&rdquo; Russell and
others talked in these theaters as well.. . .

<i  >LJ</i>) on the old-fashioned stuff. I love
old-fashioned stuff; it saves a lot of time and typing. However,
your article doesn't do justice to
<span   class="bold"><b>uuencode</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>uudecode</b></span>.
There is no need at all to save stuff on disk twice. I often just
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar cvzf -
  mail -s subject <span   class="emphasis"><em>recpt</em></span>@<span   class="emphasis"><em>domain</em></span>.com
</pre><p>which results in less typing, less waiting, less stuff to be
deleted.
</p><p>And the recipient doesn't need to save the mail and then
<b  >uudecode&nbsp;<i><tt>file</tt></i></b>.
It's easier to use the | (pipe) command of the mailer:
<b  >|uudecode</b> and the (compressed) file is output
directly on disk.</p><p>&mdash;Alessandro Rubini rubini@gnu.org</p><p>Well, you are right, of course. However, the &ldquo;Take Command&rdquo;
column is considered a newbie column, so I like to keep it short
and simple. I didn't want to get into explanations of pipes or
mailer options, both of which have been discussed in other
articles. With <span   class="bold"><b>mutt</b></span> and other
mailers, you don't even have to do the uuencode any more; just
choose the attach option and it is MIME-encoded, then sent off. I
was called to task by someone else for not mentioning that

February 2000) was an interesting and informative article. I
discovered an enlightening tidbit while using the StarOffice suite.
We can only hope that Sun's commitment to the Linux community is
not reflected in the fact that typing &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; into the StarWriter

little article on using the Apache proxy server to suppress banner
ads. The technique is very interesting and fun to play with. I did,
however, have a problem.</p><p>Setting up Apache as a proxy was a breeze. Getting
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_rewrite</b></span> to work was not. It
was only after some perusing of the Apache mod_rewrite
documentation that I found my problem. Whether you are compiling
Apache with mod_proxy and mod_rewrite, or loading them as modules,
you <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> load mod_rewrite after mod_proxy or
it will not work.</p><p>On a side note, I think it should at least be mentioned that
many web sites make money (or at least try to alleviate their
costs) by running the banner ads. Anyone who wishes to set this up
should at least give that a thought before actually doing
it.</p><p>&mdash;Stephen Carpenter sjc@delphi.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2b3bdf0"></a>Slink Not Debian</h2></div></div><p>I just finished reading your review of &ldquo;Learning Debian
GNU/Linux&rdquo; at
<a href="../071/3821.html" target="_self">http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue71/3821.html</a>
.</p><p>Having owned this book and spent a good deal of time
conversing with both O'Reilly and VA Linux, I think you have made
an error that deserves mentioning. You state near the end of your
review, &ldquo;A CD-ROM containing the Debian 2.1 distribution is bound
into the book.&rdquo; This is incorrect.</p><p>What is actually bound into the book is a copy of VA Linux's
&ldquo;slink and a half&rdquo; modified version of the Debian GNU/Linux 2.1
distribution. This is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the Debian GNU/Linux
2.1 distribution, but a Frankenstein hybrid of the stable 2.1
(slink) distribution and the unstable 2.2 (potato) distribution.
The new user may have some difficulty getting help with this
hybrid, and VA Linux will not provide any support except to state
that it is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> Debian 2.1, and if you want
support, you should purchase their boxed distribution. Please
inform your readership of this state of affairs.</p><p>Thank you for your time in this matter.</p><p>&mdash;Richard Coleman richard_coleman@jws.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2b3c160"></a>Yet Another Linux University</h2></div></div><p>I very much enjoyed the March issue of
<i  >LJ</i>. It was one of the best I had seen in
months.</p><p>Since the focus of the issue was training, I would like to
bring to your attention a project you may not be aware of: Linux
University
(<a href="http://www.linuxuniversity.org" target="_self">http://www.linuxuniversity.org/</a>).
This is not the SGI training program of the same name, but a
community-based effort to provide free Linux training to the free
software community.</p><p>LU has been in existence for about two years, but has begun
gaining momentum only in the last six months or so. The current
course offerings are geared primarily toward developers, with
classes in C and Perl, both of which have been taught in Nashville
by members of NLUG. However, plans are in the works to offer
classes entitled GTK+, Using the GIMP, Inside the Kernel, Linux
Security Primer, Introduction to TCP/IP and Linux System
Administration to the Web and Finding a User Group Near You.</p><p>The distinction of the project is that all training, whether
it occurs in cyberspace or meatspace, is free of charge (although
donations are welcome), classes are taught by members of the Linux
community, content must be released under an open-source license,
and it actively seeks to involve local Linux user groups.</p><p>If any of your readers would like to help, we encourage them
to drop by the Linux University web site, check out what we have so
far, and get their hands dirty filling in the holes.

the August 1999 <i  >Linux Journal</i> was a real
standout, especially with the code downloadable from your web site.
The article was packed with directly usable, accurate
information.</p><p>The code was a model for any programmer who wants to set a
high standard. The style and format was extremely readable. The
comments struck a good balance between enough information and
avoidance of excess.</p><p>I used this article as a guidebook to bring my limited Visual
C++ and Visual Basic experience into my Linux proficiency. In two
weeks, I was able to work through the program and get a respectable
foothold in graphics programming in the most established and robust
graphics platform in the UNIX/Linux world.</p><p>It is a very good guidebook that can accomplish that.</p><p>&mdash;Robert G.

(&ldquo;Red Hat buys Cygnus&rdquo;) in the January 2000 issue is on the mark.
I too share some of the same concerns.</p><p>&mdash;amgursa@cris.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2b3c948"></a>Painting the Desktop</h2></div></div><p>I was reading Michael Hammel's &ldquo;Artist's Guide to the
Desktop, Part 2&rdquo; (and enjoyed it very much, by the way) and
noticed the reference to GKrellM in the section on epplets. I
appreciate his mentioning it, but would like to let you know that
GKrellM is no more an epplet than is
<span   class="bold"><b>xmms</b></span> or any other Gtk
application.</p><p>Perhaps the source of his impression is that initially it
became most widely used by Enlightenment users, but there are
actually many KDE, AfterStep, Blackbox, etc. users. While I realize
Mr. Hammel would probably not have mentioned GKrellM at all in your
article had you understood this, I still want to nudge the record
back to what my program actually is.</p><p>I have subscribed to <i  >Linux Journal</i> for
several years and have always found your columns very worthwhile. I
hope you have many more articles to come.</p><p>&mdash;Bill Wilson, bill@gkrellm.net</p><p>Most probably. I enjoy working with them and have many ideas.

the April 2000 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>My relations with salespeople have always been on the cool
side. It has not mattered much whether the guy is trying to sell me
something or if he is a colleague. And if sales guys get the fridge
treatment, then marketing guys have been worthy of only the freezer
technique.</p><p>I'd like to lodge a complaint. You are rocking my boat. You
are moving my perspective. You are changing my world! I've been
reading <i  >LJ</i> for a couple of years and eyed this
&ldquo;marketing guy&rdquo; who came onboard about a year ago with fear,
uncertainty and doubt. Gradually that has changed, and I'm
beginning to realize, &ldquo;Hey! Maybe some of these marketing guys
aren't so bad after all.&rdquo;</p><p>I'm attending part of a Linux seminar next week. My boss
okayed it immediately (when I reminded him of my request, that
is)--a year ago, he would not even have considered it. It's not
only the world of computers that is changing; it is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> world. And, yes, we need marketing to
achieve world domination, but maybe we can change the rules there
as well. Articles like yours are changing the rules, attitudes and
preconceptions.</p><p>Doc, you're all right.</p><p>&mdash;Stein Bjorndal stein@proact.no</p></div></div>
