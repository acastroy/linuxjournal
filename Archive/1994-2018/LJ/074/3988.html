Intel x86 architecture and still has strong roots there, it is
highly portable. Linux runs on everything from SGIs at the high end
to Palm Pilots, Psion PDAs and tiny embedded microcontrollers at
the low end.
</p><p>Linux's world just got a little larger. It now runs on the
IBM System/390 mainframe. That's right; there is now a port of
Linux to the IBM System/390 mainframe architecture. Once you've
booted it, it works much like you'd expect any other Linux system
to. As a matter of fact, there are <span   class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> ports:
there's IBM's, which runs only on relatively recent System/390
machines and was developed in secret, and there's also Linas
Vepstas' &ldquo;Bigfoot&rdquo; port, which runs on older System/370 machines
as well and was done as a proper open-source project. Bigfoot was
quite close to running&mdash;it boots the kernel and loads /bin/sh&mdash;when
IBM dropped the bomb. Reconciliation of the two projects is an
ongoing and somewhat acrimonious issue.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe82580.0xf7a870"></a>VM on the Mainframe</h2></div></div><p>I can hear some readers scratching their heads in puzzlement.
If you have a mainframe, you presumably already have a perfectly
good and extremely expensive operating system for it, right?
Running Linux on such a machine means taking down what is almost
certainly an incredibly expensive and probably highly loaded
production machine&mdash;not a good idea.</p><p>Well, the first part is true. However, if you have a recent
S/390 <span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> any version of VM (virtual machine),
you don't have to interrupt service at all to play with other
operating systems on your production machine. If you're coming to
this from the Linux/x86 world, you're probably aware of VMWare,
which effectively splits your PC and lets you boot Windows NT in a
virtual machine under Linux (and if you're not, you should be&mdash;it's
an incredibly cool application). Well, IBM mainframes did it
first.</p><p>The VM operating system (also called a &ldquo;hypervisor&rdquo;, like a
supervisor on steroids) was designed from the start to do exactly
that; in essence, under VM, each user gets his or her own copy of
the machine. It looks exactly like a System/390, complete with
attached peripherals, and the user owns (effectively, is root on)
that virtual machine. Behind the scenes, of course, the peripherals
are simulated and are managed by VM, and the hardware is designed
with virtualization assistance features which VM exploits. This is
analogous to the way VMWare provides &ldquo;disk access&rdquo; by simulating
each disk as a file within the Linux file system. VM can also
simply present an actual physical device, if appropriate to your
needs.</p><p>This gets <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> interesting when you
realize you can run VM in your own Virtual Machine. In fact, a very
common use of VM is testing a new system second-level; that is,
running underneath the instance of VM actually running on the bare
metal. This allows you to make sure all your existing programs
still work. Only when you have all the bugs worked out of the new
system do you briefly shut down the machine and bring it back up
with the new system running on the actual, rather than a virtual,
machine. You can be confident it will work, since you've already
extensively tested it.</p><p>There are other tricks you can do with VM. IBM's mainframe
cash cow is OS/390, formerly MVS. You can run OS/390&mdash;or VSE, the
third mainframe OS&mdash;in a virtual machine, although you cannot run
guest operating systems under OS/390. Thus, VM lets you do the same
test upgrade process with OS/390 as it does with VM itself. The
virtual machines do not have to reflect the hardware configuration
of the physical machine: virtual machines can be multiprocessor
machines, even on a uniprocessor real system, or vice versa. Give
each machine as much memory as you think it ought to have and its
own set of printers, tapes, LAN adapters, whatever.</p><p>This is such a massively useful feature that IBM, in its more
recent machines, has included a hardware feature which acts as a
stripped-down VM in microcode; whether it <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>,
in fact, a stripped-down older version of VM is a subject of
debate. In any event, even without running VM, you get the benefit
of LPARs (&ldquo;Logical PARtitions&rdquo;) which effectively allow you to
partition your mainframe into a small number (usually 15 or fewer)
of conceptual machines. IBM's mainframe competitors offer
essentially the same functionality under different names, such as
Amdahl's MDF.</p><p>How efficient is virtualization under VM? The architecture
was designed with self-virtualization in mind, so it is much more
efficient than VMWare. When a virtual machine under VM isn't doing
anything, it consumes very little in the way of resources. Medium
to large VM systems typically support about 5000 simultaneous
logins (each, mind you, with its own virtual machine) without
hiccuping.</p><p>David Boyes at Dimension Enterprises recently did a web
server torture test&mdash;in an LPAR running a single VM instance, so
<span   class="emphasis"><em>his</em></span> machine was running second-level on a
medium-sized S/390, and each of his Linux machines was running
<span   class="emphasis"><em>third</em></span>-level. His one goal was to see how many
Linux boxes he could bring up, simultaneously serving requests. The
results were somewhat astounding.</p><p>Are you sitting down? He ran out of resources at 41,400
simultaneous Linux machines&mdash;forty-one thousand four hundred. I'll
get to what <span   class="emphasis"><em>that's</em></span> good for a little later;
the notion of 41,400 web servers on a single physical box ought to
give you an idea, though.</p><p>The upshot is, if you have access to a recent System/390, you
can almost certainly spare the resources to play with Linux/390
without noticeably affecting your production system. If you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> have access to a mainframe, well, just
keep reading. I have a little surprise coming up.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe82580.0xf7aef8"></a>Linux on the Mainframe</h2></div></div><p>One obvious question is, &ldquo;what good does this do?&rdquo; Let's
look at a few scenarios. Scott Courtney has addressed this issue
wonderfully in his essay at LinuxPlanet (see Resources), which
should be required reading if you're interested in L/390&mdash;it is a
great deal more in-depth than my article.</p><p>UNIX administration and development skills are much more
common and much cheaper than mainframe skills. Thus, it's going to
be easier to find people to work on Linux on your mainframe than it
would be to find OS/390, VSE or VM gurus.</p><p>What good is a mainframe? Mainframes traditionally had little
in the way of CPU power (no longer true&mdash;you get plenty of raw CPU
speed out of one), but have absolutely fantastic I/O capabilities.
One of the main needs in a big web server farm or a big e-commerce
server is I/O, of course.</p><p>Linux/390 presents an interesting migration path for
organizations which are seeking to de-emphasize their mainframes
but can't just decommission them, because it provides services
simply unavailable in other environments. I've personally seen this
scenario happen twice: once at Rice University and once at
Princeton. Plans to shut the dinosaur down were announced, then
retracted once it became clear that vital parts of the campus would
grind to a halt, since there was simply no viable alternative to
some of the mainframe services. Moving over to Linux for those
things it <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> do provides a smoother and
cheaper transition, without the need for additional hardware. Let's
face it: if your organization is going to be moving away from
OS/390 or VM, better they should move to Linux than to another OS.
Since Linux running Samba is already a good back-office substitute
for NT, you could provide Windows browsing services to your users
without ever needing PC hardware, let alone an NT license.</p><p>Another exciting possibility is that VM licenses tend to be
held by academic institutions. Imagine a third-year computer
science course on operating systems or networking. Now imagine each
student getting his very own Linux box with which to play. There's
full OS source code, a full development environment and isolation
from the production systems and other students. A fantastic course
could be developed around a study of Linux internals in such an
environment, and a medium-sized S/390 could support a class of 25
students, all recompiling the kernel at once, without breaking a
sweat.</p><p>The commercial version of this scenario is the commercial
web-hosting server. Traditionally, this means you get dedicated
access to a machine in a rack space somewhere, physically managed
by an ISP. We'll do the numbers a little later, but in short, if
you're doing this on a large scale, the price of a mainframe and a
VM license get dwarfed quickly by the price of a whole bunch of
fast, rack-mounted PCs. Your labor cost also drops radically, as
you don't have to physically set up yet another PC; you simply
create one more virtual machine on your VM box, and give it its own
copy of the installed system disks.</p><p>As an aside, it doesn't hurt to remember that the total cost
of network ownership typically breaks down to less than one-quarter
hardware, roughly one-third service and facilities, with the
remainder the necessary staff to support it (IDC, 1996).
Administration tasks are obviously greatly simplified when the
entire network of Linux machines is contained within a single
box.</p><p>It would also be quite possible to separate various services
onto various virtual machines. Sendmail would get its own (virtual)
Linux box, DNS another, Samba another. This would be good from both
a security standpoint (an exploit on one machine compromises only
one service) and a reliability standpoint. You can also split the
various pieces of a multi-tier application (e.g., web front end,
business rules processing engine in the middle and RDBMS on the
back end) among separate virtual machines, and run your database on
OS/390, if you prefer. The isolation would make both debugging and
development somewhat easier. I <span   class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> this is
something we always laugh at the NT people for requiring, but there
are three advantages to the Linux-on-a-virtual-machine method of
service isolation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Additional hardware cost is zero, as opposed to a
couple thousand dollars per machine.</p></li><li><p>Additional software cost is zero, as opposed to the
cost of an NT license per machine.</p></li><li><p>Actual resource utilization overhead is very low,
since VM's virtual machines consume almost no resources unless they
are actually running.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe82580.0xf7b580"></a>Price and Performance</h2></div></div><p>Mainframes are expensive. There's no way around that fact.
They're less expensive than they used to be, but they're certainly
not $800 PCs. I'm not particularly <span   class="emphasis"><em>au courant</em></span>
with IBM's pricing structure, but let's take a million dollars as a
high-end price. A million dollars will buy you a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> of mainframe; you'd get a terrific IBM
support contract with it and a VM license, as well as a backup
solution. Most mainframe shops run OS/390, often in tandem with VM,
but if your purpose is to run many Linux virtual machines, then
you'd want VM and would have no use for OS/390 unless you wanted to
do traditional mainframe computing too. I'm told a brand-new,
top-end system with several terabytes of DASD is closer to $600,000
than a million, and much cheaper secondhand. However, for the
purposes of argument, let's stick with a million as a nice round
figure.</p><p>What do you get for that price? A machine which will run&mdash;I'm
being extremely conservative here&mdash;1000 simultaneous Linux machines
without a problem. You're talking $1000 per Linux box: not too
different from the cost of a low-end rackmount Linux system, thus
the price right there is a wash.</p><p>Obviously, it's a lot cheaper to rent space for a single
S/390 and its associated disk arrays than it is to rent space for
1000 physical Linux boxes; even in one-unit packaging at 42
units/rack, you're still talking 24 racks. That's certainly more
than even a big S/390 is going to take. Networking gets easier too;
buy the 155MBps ATM options on your OSA cards, plug up to twelve
ATM interfaces into your machine (if you need more scalability,
options exist for you) and coordinate internal communication
between your virtual machines via a virtual LAN. An internal,
virtual LAN is much easier and cleaner to administer than a
physical topology of switches and runs of Cat5 and fiber.</p><p>You can cut back on resource usage, too. If some of your
machines will have identical file systems (it's fairly common, for
example, in the UNIX world, to mount /usr read-only and have
symlinks to what needs to be writable), then you can maintain a
single disk with the shared file system and mount it from each of
the virtual machines. It's just like sharing file systems over NFS,
only without the ugliness of NFS. This, incidentally, was what
David Boyes did when running his 41,400 machines: all shared /usr
and /bin; with a little more trickery, /lib could be shared too.
Furthermore, there's no need to specify much&mdash;or indeed, any&mdash;swap
for your Linux machines; VM knows all about memory management and
does it very effectively. Give each of your Linux machines a bunch
of virtual memory, and let the VM hypervisor worry about paging it
in and out.</p><p>Now let's look at reliability. We'll assume one of these
$1000 machines has a MTBF of 1000 days. That's probably on the high
side for a thousand-dollar machine, if you're pushing it fairly
hard. At $1000, you're not getting RAID, your disks are probably
IDE, and even redundant power supplies are unlikely. If you have a
thousand of these boxes in a room, the chance you will get through
a day with none of them failing is
1-(1/1000)&lt;+&gt;1000&lt;+&gt;, or about 37%. In other words, two
days out of three, you're going to have to replace
something.</p><p>Of course, if the mainframe fails, <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
your machines fail. However, one of the things you're paying for
with your million dollars is rock-solid reliability: a System/390
is built with enough redundancy that if something fails, the rest
of the system stays up and can be hot-swapped. This isn't just
disks: on multiprocessor machines, you can replace a failed
processor without bringing down the system. I giggled when I saw
Microsoft trumpeting it had achieved 99.5% up time with NT. Thus,
under exceptionally good circumstances, properly administered and
maintained, NT is down, on average, a little less than an hour a
week. I was a VM systems programmer from 1992 to 1994; during that
time, we typically had under an hour of scheduled down time a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>year</em></span>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unscheduled</em></span> down
time was zero.</p><p>Backups cease to be an issue; because VM is managing all the
disks for the virtual machines, all their data is backed up with
the VM backup. The same with data integrity; for that kind of cash,
you get well-implemented hot-swappable RAID, in which the
complexity is never even visible to the Linux machines, because
they see their disk space just as devices presented to them by VM.
Basically, no matter how many virtual machines you have, you have
only one actual machine to protect, so the cost of doing so remains
constant, rather than scaling with the number of machines.</p><p>Furthermore, VM has an extremely efficient cache. Frequently
accessed disk blocks will be held in the cache and requests never
go to the drives at all. This is a huge win if you either share
disks among machines, or if you're running a server farm.</p><p>There's also a low end in the mainframe market. The P/390 is
a PCI card containing a chip with the S/390 instruction set on it.
It is sold in combination with another PCI card which provides a
channel interface (so you can drive your real S/390 peripherals), a
PC running OS/2 and some driver software; you run VM, VSE, OS/390
or Linux on the card. The prices for the PC Server System/390 are
under $10,000 now. There's also the slightly more expensive R/390,
which sits in an AIX box. Ten thousand dollars is well within the
budget of a smallish software development company. Of course, these
boxes won't support a thousand simultaneous machines, but they'd do
fifty fairly comfortably (they support 130 or so simultaneous CMS
users). In fact, I'm planning to use just such a system to play
with a virtual Beowulf cluster, among other things, and maybe
experiment with MOSIX, too.</p><p>There's also a lot of middle ground between these two ends.
In short, it's not much more expensive, from a purely hardware
point of view, to put <span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> virtual Linux boxes on
a mainframe than it is to simply buy <span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> boxes,
and it becomes a good deal cheaper as <span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>
increases.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe82580.0xf7bc60"></a>But Is It Linux?</h2></div></div><p>The short answer is, yes, it's Linux. The version I'm running
at penguinvm.princeton.edu is 2.2.13. The S/390 patches are already
in the stock 2.2.14 source, and IBM's team is hard at work
integrating L/390 into 2.3.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>. By the time you
read this, it should all have been merged fairly seamlessly into
the mainline development kernel tree.</p><p>Linux on the System/390 is just as much Linux as Linux/PPC,
Linux/SPARC, Linux/m68k or Linux/Alpha. The System/390 port is
integrated into the main kernel source tree; unlike ELKS or
RT-Linux, it's the stock kernel, rather than a subset or an
extension. From a user's perspective, nothing differs between
running it on a 390 and running it on an x86 machine. The shell
works the same way, X applications work the same way, GNOME has
been ported (by adding a couple of lines to the configure scripts)
and it all just works. There's not much exciting to say, because if
it comes with source, the odds are very good you can build and run
it with minimal effort. As &ldquo;Think Blue Linux&rdquo; gets off the
ground, you should be able to install a binary with RPM. At the
time of this writing, they had about 420 RPMs available; there
should soon be many more.</p><p>From an application programmer's perspective, it's about the
same. There are a couple of very minor patches for config.sub and
config.guess to get <span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span> to
recognize the S/390 architecture (these have already been submitted
to Ben Elliston at Red Hat, who maintains
<span   class="bold"><b>autoconf</b></span>). With its next release,
configure should support L/390 with no modification. Once the
patches have been applied, anything which uses autoconf builds and
runs right out of the box. This includes Bochs (an x86 emulator);
apparently, some intrepid soul has built Bochs and booted the NT
Server, very slowly, under L/390.</p><p>The other major issue is endianness. Unlike the x86, S/390 is
big-endian. Programs which assume Intel byte order will fail. But
if these programs have already been ported to, say, Linux/PPC
(another 32-bit, big-endian platform), then those bugs have been
crushed. This is not a 390-specific problem as such, but a general
portability issue.</p><p>At the time of this writing,
<span   class="bold"><b>pthreads</b></span> support was still buggy
in the version of L/390 I was using, which caused odd bugs in VNC
and the Hercules emulator; this has apparently already been fixed,
but I haven't rebuilt the system with the latest patches. Likewise,
there was an optimizer bug in GCC, causing it to generate bad code
with <b  >-O2</b> and above; this too has already been
fixed, and should no longer be an issue by the time this appears in
print.</p><p>Deep within the guts of the kernel, things get fairly hairy.
IBM has released its kernel code and glibc modifications under the
GPL, and they're available from the IBM DeveloperWorks page; it's
all there and well-commented. It's fascinating stuff, especially
the huge differences between x86 interrupt design and the way S/390
talks to its peripherals, but far beyond the scope of this
article.</p><p>Networking is handled via either the OSA-2 (Ethernet or
token-ring) device driver or point-to-point high-speed channels.
(OSA is the ironically named &ldquo;open systems adapter&rdquo;: the device
driver is OCO&mdash;object code only, meaning no source.) If you're
running under VM, you can set up something called IUCV (Inter User
Communications Vehicle), which basically lets you establish a PPP
connection to another virtual machine. If, by the way, you're
beginning to get the feeling IBM has its own language, all
acronyms, you're absolutely right. What this IUCV means is that
it's purely internal&mdash;there is no real-world device corresponding
to an IUCV adapter. You can also set up a virtual CTCA interface
(channel-to-channel adapter). Channels <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
real-world interfaces, implemented these days over fiber optic
cables. IUCV runs at 500MBps, CTCA at 250MBps. Communication
between your virtual machines should not be a bottleneck. Writing
to IBM urging them to change their OSA-2 OCO policy is unlikely to
help, but might make you feel better.</p><p>Currently, penguinvm.princeton.edu uses CTCA to talk to the
VM hypervisor's TCP/IP stack, but it would also work to set up a
Linux virtual machine and use it as a firewall, doing packet
filtering and network address translation for the machines behind
it. That machine can then talk directly to either the outside world
with its OSA-2 interface or VM's stack with a different IUCV/CTCA
interface.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe82580.0x1374430"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Installation is still ugly. Basically, you're not going to
get anywhere unless you understand how to install a new operating
system on a System/390, <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> you understand how
to install and set up Linux. It's a four-step process:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Build a boot loader image from the supplied
files.</p></li><li><p>Boot the loader.</p></li><li><p>Dump the file system tar archive onto newly created
EXT2 partitions.</p></li><li><p>Reboot and answer the configuration
questions.</p></li></ul></div><p>The first two steps require S/390 knowledge, the last two
Linux knowledge. You <span   class="emphasis"><em>may</em></span> be able to puzzle it
out from the documentation, but if you're shaky in one area or the
other, it's probably a good idea to find someone who has the other
base covered.
</p><p>Marist College has been at the forefront of Linux/390
development. Marist's page contains the tape and disk images
necessary to get started, as well as documentation, and is the
place to begin. There is also an extremely active mailing list
hosted at Marist, Linux-VM, which is not VM-specific, but is
devoted to Linux on the mainframe, with or without VM. The file
system layout of the Marist disk is a little weird if you're used
to Red Hat or SuSE. This will change as actual distributions get
ported.</p><p>There <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> already a distribution for the
S/390: &ldquo;Think Blue Linux&rdquo; or &ldquo;Iron Penguin&rdquo;, based on Red Hat
6.1. At the time of this writing, it is only a downloadable
collection of packages and not yet available on CD or tape.</p><p>As soon as I get the testbed P/390 I have available in
Virginia fired up and networked (which should also have happened
long ago by the time you read this), Richard Higson and I will
begin the process of porting Debian Potato. I'm expecting it to be
fairly easy, since Debian already supports quite a few
platforms.</p><p>In short, by the time this is published, installation should
be much simpler than it currently is. It's not insanely difficult
even now, but it is comparable to Linux/x86 in early 1993, when SLS
was beginning to get off the ground. It certainly is no Lizard or
YAST2, and installation requires you to understand both the
System/390 and Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe82580.0x1374b10"></a>That's Neat, but I Don't Have a
Mainframe</h2></div></div><p>Perhaps I've convinced you Linux/390 is cool, and you'd like
to see it for yourself. Now, you probably have a problem: you do
not have access to a System/390. There are at least three ways you
can play with Linux/390 without already having an actual
System/390.</p><p>The least interesting option is to do what the IBM guys did
initially and download their glibc, gcc and kernel patches, and
build L/390 software in a cross-compilation environment hosted
under Linux/x86. Sure, this works, but it's not very much fun. For
the experience, you need to be running L/390 itself, which requires
a System/390.</p><p>The expensive option is to buy a mainframe. A minimal P/390
on the used market will set you back less than $10,000. That's not
all that much, is it? Okay, so $10,000 might be a little steep for
a neat toy.</p><p>You'd still like to play, but can't spend ten grand? How does
&ldquo;free&rdquo; sound, then? Free, as in beer <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span>
speech. Roger Bowler has written an intensely cool emulator,
Hercules, which runs under Linux and emulates either a System/370
(the previous generation of IBM mainframe) or a System/390; it also
emulates many of the more common mainframe peripherals. It's open
source (not GPL, but the license is quite reasonable, basically
just forbidding commercial use) and very easy to build. The
emulator is sufficiently thorough to boot OS/MFT (a simpler IBM
mainframe OS, circa 1966) and use MFT to build and boot OS/MVT
(MVS's progenitor). Work is being done to bring MVS 3.8 up on
it.</p><p>More to the point, Hercules emulates a System/390 well enough
to boot Linux/390. I've put up a page explaining how; see the
Resources section. Currently, it's not yet useful; there is no
network device emulation, so getting stuff into and out of the
machine is difficult. It can, we think, be done with the supplied
tools and tape image files. By the time you read this, someone will
probably have figured out how to load the Marist file system onto a
3330 image, which would allow for actual development. Hopefully, it
will not take too long to develop enough network support to allow
the virtual S/390 to appear on the network, in the same way VMWare
machines do.</p><p>Be warned: you'll need patience. On my PII-300, Hercules
takes close to an hour to boot Linux, although once it's up and
running, interactive performance is not actually bad at all (I
started playing with Linux on a 4MB 386/25, and Hercules is no more
painful than it was). Many people on the Hercules mailing list
(sign up from the Hercules home page) are aggressively working on
performance-tweaking Hercules, so its speed should increase
significantly. The referenced page will contain updates as we turn
Hercules into a reasonable development environment for L/390, so
check back often.</p><p>It's a grand adventure; we're exploring new territory every
day. We need your help. Hop aboard, and bring your penguins. The
dinosaur doesn't bite. Honest.</p><p><a href="3988s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3988s2.html" target="_self">Glossary</a></p></div></div>
