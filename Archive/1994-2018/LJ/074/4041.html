    All in all, we've had a good time with this one&mdash;you will too.

be&mdash;so many people, so little space. After making what seemed like
an infinite list of people we wanted to talk to and honor, we
decided we better figure out a way to narrow our focus. We did this
by using the Kernel 1.0 credits file&mdash;these people are truly the
&ldquo;founding fathers&rdquo;--and adding a few more names, including
Patrick Volkerding and Alessandro Rubini. Even so, we still had 84
names. Knowing we might not be able to find everyone (how right we
were!), we dug in and started sending out e-mails, asking for phone
numbers and interviews.
</p><p>All those we were able to contact were gracious and
cooperative, sending us e-mail copies of their answers so that we
can include them on the web site in coming weeks. Having just
talked to Linus in September of last year, I decided to write a
short bit about him without actually contacting him again. We'll
save that for the next kernel release. I think you're going to
enjoy learning a bit about the people who brought us our favorite
operating system.</p><p>If Linus is the &ldquo;father&rdquo; of Linux (and we all agree he is),
then &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; is the &ldquo;godfather&rdquo;. He is the glue that holds the
Linux community together, and he shares all with us this month in
an article and a centerfold.</p><p>All in all, we've had a good time with this one&mdash;you will
too.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1737580.0x182f348"></a>A Visit with Caldera</h2></div></div><p>Some folks from Caldera came by the first week of April to
tell us what's new in Utah. After their change in focus from
&ldquo;Linux for Business&rdquo; to &ldquo;Linux for eBusiness&rdquo;, Caldera has gone
solidly after the e-commerce market, with three new product
releases: eDesktop, eServer and eBuilder. All three products have
been optimized for use on the Internet. eDesktop 2.4 is the latest
release of the Caldera OpenLinux distribution with enhancements
(improved hardware detection by Lizard) and additions, such as the
Citric ICA client which provides access to Windows applications
through the Web, and MoneyDance, a personal checkbook-type
application comparable to Quicken. Also, remote administration can
be done through the Web as well as unattended installs across main
machines. eServer provides Pentium-class operation and is free.
eBuilder is the big one, a combination of Open Linux eServer,
Evergreen's Ecential 3.0 and IBM's WebSphere. It is designed to
give the e-commerce site everything it needs, e.g., merchandise and
multimedia database, search engine, order distribution, shopping
cart and payment processing.</p><p>The eBuilder product is directed toward the big business
customer who wants to get into the e-commerce market in a hurry. It
is modular, distributed and easy to customize and manage. It is
also <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> expensive&mdash;many thousands of
dollars. At Comdex 2000, Ransom Love said Linux is a
&ldquo;proprietary&rdquo; platform, and with eBuilder, it becomes a very
commercial one for Caldera.</p><p>&mdash;Marjorie Richardson, Editor in Chief</p><p><a href="4041s1.html" target="_self">Contents</a></p></div></div>
