    the diff and patch commands.

about the ways Linux is &ldquo;different&rdquo; from other, more commercial
operating systems. Because the Linux kernel is open source, it is
possible for each and every user to become a contributor.
Certainly, nearly everyone reading this knows so; it's sort of like
preaching to the choir. However, the fact is that most Linux users,
even those skilled in the programming arts, have never contributed
to the code of the Linux kernel, even though most of us have had
days where we thought to ourselves, &ldquo;gee, I wish Linux could do
this...&rdquo; Through this article and others, I hope to convince some
of you to take a look at the Linux kernel in a new, more proactive
light.
</p><p>What are some valid reasons for not contributing to the
kernel efforts? First, maybe you can't legally. Many programmers
sign contracts that limit their ability to code outside of work,
even on non-commercial projects. This is the main reason I chose a
profession that has relatively little to do with programming, other
than the occasional Perl script. Second, it is possible you don't
know how. Many Linux users are relatively new programmers trained
in traditional computer science. I know from my own CS education
that many schools tend to teach &ldquo;modern&rdquo; programming skills&mdash;I
was one of the few in my particular school who chose (or knew how)
to program without an IDE (integrated development environment).
Sad, but true. Third, many professional programmers now tend to
work with revision control systems in the workplace, and may be
hesitant to contribute to projects (such as the kernel development
effort) which still use the &ldquo;bare metal&rdquo; approach. Last and most
likely, many programmers with the skills to hack Linux don't have
the time to do so. These are all valid reasons why perfectly
qualified programmers with good ideas, a fresh outlook and a desire
to contribute have chosen not to. Nothing I can say can help them
get past some of those issues, but I hope I can make kernel
programming more accessible to at least a small percentage of
people.</p><p>This is the first article in a series, and I will attempt to
dispel some of the mystery behind revision control. Many
open-source projects, including the Linux kernel, still use the
<span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>patch</b></span> method of content control
for a variety of reasons. Most open-source projects still accept
patches in this format, even if they distribute code via CVS or
some other revision-control system. First, diff and patch provide a
project maintainer with an immense amount of control. Patches can
be submitted and distributed via e-mail and in plain text;
maintainers can read and judge the patch before it ever gets near a
tree. Second, there's never a worry about access control or the CVS
server going down. Third, it's readily available, generally doesn't
require any special tools that aren't distributed as part of every
GNU system, and has been used for years. However, bare-bones
revision control makes it difficult to track changes, maintain
multiple branches or do any other &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; things provided by
Perforce, CVS or other revision control systems.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span> and patch are a set of
command-line programs designed to generate and integrate changes
into a source tree. There are multiple &ldquo;diff&rdquo; formats supported
by the GNU utilities. One major advantage of diff and patch over
newer revision-control systems is that diff, especially the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>unified</em></span> diff format, allows kernel maintainers
to look at changes easily without blindly integrating them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218c580.0x22848c8"></a>The diff Family</h2></div></div><p>For the uninitiated, diff and patch are just two of the
commands in a complete set of GNU utilities. While they are the
most commonly used in practice, other tools are often employed in
specific situations. For the purposes of this document, I won't
concentrate on these utilities, but will treat them only briefly.
For a more complete look, check out your local set of man and info
pages.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span> is the first command in
the set. It has a simple purpose: to create a file (often
confusingly called a patch or a diff) which contains the
differences between two text files or two groups of text files.
These files are constructed to make it easy to merge the
differences into the older file.
<span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span> can write in multiple
formats, although the unified difference format is generally
preferred. The patches this command generates are much easier to
distribute than whole files, and they allow maintainers to see
quickly and easily what changed and to make a judgment.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>patch</b></span> is diff's logical
complement, although oddly, it didn't come along until well after
diff was in relatively common use.
<span   class="bold"><b>patch</b></span> takes a patch file generated
by diff and applies it against a file or group of files.
<span   class="bold"><b>patch</b></span> will notify the user if
there is a conflict, although it is often smart enough to resolve
simple conflicts. Additionally, patch can act in the reverse; with
an updated file and the original patch, this command can revert a
file back to its pristine form.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>cmp</b></span> is diff's counterpart
for binary files. As applications for binary files in source
control are limited, this command is often not used in that
environment. Usually, projects that include binary files (for
example, a logo) have some other mechanism for updating these
components. (Keep in mind that the XPM image format common in Linux
applications can actually be text-based and can be controlled using
the above commands.)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>diff3</b></span> is a variant on diff
that allows for computing and merging the differences among three
files. Personally, I tend to use diff for these purposes, but there
are likely reasons why this command is useful in specific
situations with which I have not yet dealt.</p><p>And finally, <span   class="bold"><b>sdiff</b></span> is an
interactive version of patch that allows for smarter patching using
your very own brain.</p><p>These tools have many uses other than content control. I do
not want to slight them by implying they are not useful. But, like
many tools, they shine only in certain circumstances. (Like that
annoying fine screwdriver you get with the set for which you've
never seen a screw small enough to use it on, tools are only as
good as the situations they are applied against.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218c580.0x2284ea0"></a>diff Concepts</h2></div></div><p>When talking about different patch formats, a number of
concepts deserve some thought. The point is probably moot: nearly
all open-source projects that use diff and friends have long since
settled on a patch format. However, these are some of the qualities
in a patch that makes one format more useful than another.</p><p>The first thing admired in a patch format is context. Context
consists of the extra lines (often three) before and after the
difference blocks in a patch. While context adds greatly to the
size of the patch file, it allows patches to be not entirely
dependent on the exact file on which the patch was based. This
quality is very important in a revision-control system, where it is
expected that your working files will be slightly different from
the master copy. Patching programs can use these context lines to
guess where the offending lines can go&mdash;and usually get it
right.</p><p>Second, patches should be reversible. Reversing is useful
when you want to go back to a previous version of the source, or
when you mistakenly flipped the options to diff and generated an
inherently reversed patch (don't laugh&mdash;we've all done it). Not all
patch formats are reversible, however.</p><p>Patch files should be efficient: small and easily readable,
but not so large as to be unwieldy for projects with large numbers
of changes (such as the Linux kernel). There is a tradeoff here, of
course. Patches without context are more efficient, but definitely
not very useful in source maintenance.</p><p>Finally, readability is a very important aspect for this
style of revision control. Patches should be obvious when it comes
to figuring out what changed and should not require the user to
flip his or her perspective from one block of text to another to
figure out the differences. Making a format human-readable is much
more difficult than creating a computer-readable one, especially
when you are trying to balance all the other format
components.</p><p>Each of the various diff formats ranks differently in each of
these metrics, and different projects may choose different formats.
The Linux kernel, for example, uses the unified difference
format.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218c580.0x2285160"></a>The diff Formats</h2></div></div><p>The POSIX, or &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, diff is the default format used by
the diff utilities. It's a terse format without any lines of
context, but is reversible. I've often seen it used as a sort of
&ldquo;generic&rdquo; patch format, since non-GNU versions of the diff
utilities can parse it.</p><p>The context diff format is another reversible format similar
to the POSIX one, but which supports context around changes. Some
projects prefer this format, especially if they include developers
outside the GNU sphere. Using GNU diff, this format can be
specified with the <b  >--context</b> option.</p><p>The unified diff format is another contextual format that is
generally more readable than the context variety. Unlike with
context diff, this format displays all the changes in a single
block, thus eliminating many of the redundant lines with context
diffs. Because of the relative merits of this format for revision
control and easy reading of patches, this is the preferred format
for the Linux kernel and many GNU projects. On the down side, many
non-GNU patch programs are unable to recognize this format. With
GNU diff, this format can be specified using the
<b  >--unified</b> option.</p><p>The side-by-side format is great for human reading of
patches, but is not readily usable for revision control. It
displays the originating file and the changes side by side. This
format is mostly just for human patch browsing, and the patch
program doesn't actually support it. GNU diff users can enable this
with the <b  >--side-by-side</b> option.</p><p>The ed format is an old format that outputs a script for the
<span   class="bold"><b>ed</b></span> text editor rather than a
special patch format. This option was needed before the modern
patch utility was created. Since it outputs a script, it contains
no context information and no reversal information. GNU provides
this option only for compatibility, and it may be invoked with the
<b  >--ed</b> switch.</p><p>The forward ed format is similar to the ed format, but is
even more useless. <span   class="bold"><b>patch</b></span> can't
process files in this format; neither can ed. If you insist,
however, GNU diff still can generate it with the
<b  >--forward-ed</b> option.</p><p>The RCS format is the one used by the revision-control system
RCS and its derivatives. It's generally not used standalone, and
patch can't actually read the format.</p><p>The preprocessor format is not quite a patch format and not
quite a script. Instead, it is an output file that contains the
contents of both files separated by C preprocessor directives such
as #ifdef, #endif, #elsif, etc. It is possible to compile either
version of the file by setting preprocessor variables (#define) in
the source file or by using the <b  >-D</b> switch of the
GNU compiler. Obviously, this format isn't of much use for revision
control, but can occasionally be useful when you want to test
changes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218c580.0x2285790"></a>Using diff</h2></div></div><p>The actual usage of diff and patch is not complicated. While
these commands, like many GNU tools, support many options allowing
users to refine the way these tools work, these options are not
actually required for everyday use. For more information on all the
command-line options of these utilities, check out their info
pages.</p><p>At its simplest, a diff command line for comparing two files
would be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
diff old.txt new.txt &gt; oldnew.patch
</pre><p>This will create a patch in the POSIX format that could later
be applied to files similar to old.txt. Please note that the output
of diff generally appears on standard output (STDOUT) and we have
used redirection to get that information into the patch file. For
GNU projects, we generally want the results in unified diff format,
so we add the <b  >-u</b> (or
<b  >--unified</b>) option to the command line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
diff -u old.txt new.txt &gt; oldnew.patch
</pre>


Generally, however, a comparison of two source trees is often
desired. These trees would be multiple revisions of a single
project or something similar. The command I generally prefer for
this would be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
diff -ruN old new &gt; oldnew.txt
</pre>


In this example, I have added two new switches. The first,
<b  >-r</b> (or <b  >--recursive</b>),
indicates we want to take a recursive look at directories instead
of files. The last switch, <b  >-N</b> (or
<b  >--new-file</b>), indicates we do not want to ignore
whether files have been added or removed from either set. In that
case, if the new directory included a file called foo.txt but the
old directory didn't, the patch would behave as if there was a
zero-byte file called foo.txt in the old directory and add it into
the patch.
</p><p>To actually get good use out of the diff command as a form of
revision control, a bit of legwork must be done first. I'll discuss
this later on.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218c580.0x2285cb8"></a>Using patch</h2></div></div><p>Generally, once a diff is generated or downloaded, the
process of patching the file is even simpler. Based on our first
example above, we could do something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
patch &lt; oldnew.patch
</pre><p>This command would read the patch file from the standard
input and apply it to whatever files were in the current directory.
Most patch formats include information on the name of the file
being patched. In our first example, it would have specified that
old.txt was the original file, and the patch command will look for
a file by that name here. If that file could not be found, it would
then prompt you for the name of the file to which the patch should
be applied.
</p><p>A number of things can go wrong during the patch process.
Occasionally, a diff may be made backwards, or you may want to
reverse a patch. By using the <b  >--reverse</b> option
to patch, you can make new.txt old.txt again. Additionally, the
patch utility can detect whether the file being patched already
contains the patch you are applying. In this case, patch will ask
you whether you want it to reverse or attempt to apply the patch
anyway. Finally, the patch could fail. If this happens, a file
named old.txt.rej (or something similar) will be created, and patch
will exit. At that point, it is up to you to look at the contents
of the .rej file (which will be in a patch format) and manually
apply the contents to the source. (I have occasionally gotten a
reject file to apply by using a larger <b  >--fuzz</b>
value of patch, but this can lead to patch application errors and
subtle bugs that you'll be scratching your head about later.) Once
the problems are worked through, however, you will have effectively
merged two sets of changes into one.</p><p>Obviously, these examples are a bit contrived. In real-world
practice, patch files are generally not applied by the same people
who made them. Instead, you will probably be either a provider of a
specific patch (a source maintainer) or one who applies a specific
patch (an end user).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218c580.0x227c860"></a>Using patch-kernel</h2></div></div><p>Although somewhat beyond the scope of this document, the
Linux kernel actually includes a script which will aid you in
keeping it up to date with the latest revisions. The
<span   class="bold"><b>patch-kernel</b></span> script is located in
the /usr/src/linux/scripts directory and will apply, in order, all
the patches necessary to bring your kernel up to the latest
revision, provided you have already downloaded them and put them in
that directory. If you don't actually intend to participate in the
Linux development effort, but just want to keep up with the latest
and greatest source, this handy script will allow you to bypass the
real workings of patch until you start developing. Once you start
adding your own changes to your source tree, I recommend you use
the manual method.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218c580.0x227c9c0"></a>Maintenance of Source Trees</h2></div></div><p>Getting back to the point of using diff and cousins as a sort
of bare-bones revision-control system, I should mention there is
obviously no one right or wrong way to maintain separate branches
of a source tree. Low-level tools like these provide you with the
framework to define the way you work, rather than forcing you into
using one method or another. My suggestions here are only
suggestions, and have been useful to me in the past when writing
patches for open-source projects. However, I haven't exactly
clocked the man-hours of Alan Cox working on the kernel or any
other project, so there may be a better way. Please feel free to
e-mail me at the address listed below with your thoughts.</p><p>When dealing with source trees, my general rule is always to
maintain more than one. Unlike CVS or other revision-control
systems, there is often no going back when you make a mistake. It
is very easy to add instability to a stable patch, and no easy way
to roll back your changes to a &ldquo;last good&rdquo; configuration. For
example, let's imagine I have a source tree for a hypothetical
project called &ldquo;Foogram&rdquo;. If I were maintaining this with CVS, I
would need only one tree and a CVS server (which obviously
maintains multiple trees). Since we don't have the advantage of a
separate server with the bare-metal approach, I would generally
have at least two directories for the project: foogram and
foogram-last. (These are my personal naming conventions.) The
last-released version would be in foogram, it's known to be stable
and it's what I have to generate all my patches against when I want
to distribute them. The foogram-last directory would contain my
latest changes. This two-tiered approach is often effective enough
for general use.</p><p>However, many projects actually get too complicated for this
approach. I have been known to create a third (or fourth or fifth)
directory which contains the latest changes relative to
foogram-last. For our purposes, I'll call this directory
foogram-work. It often contains unstable and recent changes I've
made to my source trees, which I want to keep separate from my more
stable patches. It's important to keep a baseline directory to
generate patches against, but this tends to lead to a rapidly
expanding number of directories that other directories are relative
against, and a mess for patching the manual way. In this example, I
would try to maintain foogram-last as the baseline for the
foogram-work directory by making sure I merge forward stable
changes as I make them. If this were to become over-complicated, I
would have to create a copy of foogram-last, called foogram-stable,
which contained the copy of foogram-last that foogram-work was
drawn against, so I could use created patches between the last and
the stable directory to apply against the working directory in
order to keep it up to date.</p><p>Confused yet? I sure am! Obviously, that's an extreme
example, and many programmers will naturally simplify the process
based on their own needs. Many projects do not require that level
of complexity from individual developers. If you are reading this
and still getting anything useful from it, you probably won't need
to go to that complicated extreme to develop your own open-source
modification patches, and instead will use the easy method.</p><p>The easy method is how it's possible to get away with keeping
only one tree around, and this has worked for me on nearly every
light project where I needed to modify only one or two source files
as part of my patch. In that case, I recommend just making a copy
of the source files you are editing, with a different extension
(such as .old); and in the main tree, creating a diff that way
using individual file patches. These small patches can be
concatenated together when distributed to project maintainers. When
doing it this way, you should be careful to run diff from the root
directory of the source tree, so that the patch will be able to
figure out later where the changed files were, especially if they
were in different directories.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218c580.0x227cc28"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Much of the information here can be extracted from info pages
and common sense. However, I hope that by documenting my own
experiences with open-source projects and patches, I can encourage
that small percentage of you who have the skill and desire to
program the kernel, but have not chosen to do so. In the future, I
hope to cover some of the other facets of kernel development that
may be turning developers away, and I would be interested in
hearing the reasons you might be nervous about lending your brain
to some of these projects. Until then, happy hacking.</p></div></div>
