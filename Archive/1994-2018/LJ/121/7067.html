How to Build LSB Applications</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">
Stuart R. Anderson</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #121, May 2004</div></div><div><p>
Don't leave your Linux software stuck on one distribution. Make it
run anywhere with
the standard that all the major distributions use.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x1e0e2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Linux Standard Base (LSB) specifies an interface between an application and a runtime
environment. Many distributions have achieved certification for their
runtime environments. This article outlines the steps needed to build
applications that adhere to the LSB interface.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x1e0e3f8"></a>
Origins of the LSB</h2></div></div><p>
The LSB Project was founded in 1997 to address the application compatibility
problem that was beginning to emerge. Different distributions
were using different versions of upstream software and building them with
different options enabled. The result was that an application built on one
distribution might not run on another distribution. Worse yet,
the application often would not work on a different version of the same distribution.
</p><p>
Originally, the LSB was intended to create a common reference implementation
for the base of a GNU/Linux system. In addition to the reference
implementation, a written specification was to be developed.
This idea wasn't well received by many of the distributions that had
considerable investments in their own base software, which they perceived
as being a competitive advantage.
</p><p>
After further discussion among the interested parties, the LSB Project
underwent
a fundamental shift in focus in order to achieve consensus among the entire
community. The shift gave priority to the written specification over the
implementation, and it defined the LSB as a behavioral specification instead
of a list of upstream feature/version pairs. This new focus was realized as
a three-prong approach: a written specification, which defines the
behavior of the system; a formal test suite, which measures an implementation
against the specification; and a sample implementation, which provides an
example of the specification.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x1e0e5b0"></a>
Structure of the LSB</h2></div></div><p>
The LSB Specification actually is made up of a generic portion, the gLSB,
and an architecture-specific portion, archLSB. The gLSB contains everything
that is common across all architectures; we try hard to define as much as
possible in the gLSB. The archLSBs contain the things that are unique to each
processor architecture, such as the machine instruction set and C library
symbol versions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x1e0e6b8"></a>
Contents of the LSB</h2></div></div><p>
As much as possible, the LSB builds on existing standards, including
the Single UNIX Specification (SUS), which has evolved from POSIX, the
System V Interface Definition (SVID) and the System V Application Binary
Interface (ABI). The LSB uses the ELF definitions from the ABI and the
interface behaviors from the SUS. It adds the formal listing of what
interfaces are available in which library as well as the data structures and
constants associated with them. See the &ldquo;Linux Standard Base
Libraries&rdquo; sidebar for the list of libraries currently specified.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x1e0e818"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Linux Standard Base Libraries</b></p><p>
As of LSB 1.3, the following shared libraries are specified in the LSB. All
other libraries must be linked statically into the application.
</p><p>
Base libraries: libc, libm, libpthread, libpam, libutil, libdl, libcrypt,
libncurses and libz.
</p><p>
Graphics libraries: libX11, libXt, libXext, libSM, libICE and libGL.
</p><p>
As the LSB continues to grow in future versions, so will this list of
libraries.
</p></div><p>
In addition to the ABI portion of the LSB, the specification also specifies
a set of commands that may be used in scripts associated with the
application.
It also mandates that the application adhere to the filesystem hierarchy
standard (FHS).
</p><p>
One additional component of the LSB is the packaging format. The LSB specifies
the package file format to be a subset of the RPM file format. The LSB does not
specify that the distribution has to be based on RPM, however, only that it has some way
of correctly processing a file in the RPM format.
</p><p>
One final item to mention is the name of the program interpreter. The
program interpreter is the first thing executed when an application is
started, and it is responsible for loading the rest of the program and shared
libraries into the process address space. Traditionally,
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 has been used, but the LSB specifies
/lib/ld-lsb.so.1 instead on IA32. Generally,
/lib/ld-<i>arch</i>-lsb.so.1 is used for other architectures. This
provides the operating system with a hook early in the process execution in case
something special needs to be done to provide the correct runtime environment
to the application. You can pass the following to GCC to change the
program interpreter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-Wl,--dynamic-linker=/lib/ld-lsb.so.1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x1e0ece8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The tools described here take care of this process for you.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x1e0edf0"></a>
The LSB Build Environment</h2></div></div><p>
A long time ago, people realized that code changes are cheaper and easier
to make when they come earlier in a development process rather than later. With this
in mind, the LSB Project has created a build environment to assist with
the creation of LSB-conforming applications. This build environment provides
a set of clean headers, stub libraries and a compiler wrapper.
</p><p>
The LSB stores much of its definition in a database. In addition to the
portions of the specification that would be tedious to edit manually, we
are able to produce a set of clean header files and stub libraries that
contain only the things specified by the LSB. Using the database in
this way helps to ensure the tools and specification stay in sync as
changes and additions are made. The packages you need to install are
described in the &ldquo;Linux Standard Base Packages&rdquo; sidebar.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x1e0efa8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Linux Standard Base Packages</b></p><p>
You can get the LSB development environment from the Linux Standard Base
(see the on-line Resources section); simply
follow the links for downloads. You should install the following
packages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
lsbdev-base: contains the headers and libraries.
</p></li><li><p>
lsbdev-cc: contains the compiler wrapper tools.
</p></li><li><p>
lsbdev-chroot: contains the alternate chroot-based environment.
</p></li><li><p>
lsbdev-c++: contains a static libstdc++, which can be used to port
some C++ applications for LSB 1.3.
</p></li></ul></div></div><p>
The first step in building an LSB-conforming application is to compile the
code with the LSB headers. If the code doesn't compile, it probably is using
something outside of the LSB. This isn't necessarily a showstopper, but
it is something to which you need to pay particular
attention. The LSB headers are installed in /opt/lsbdev-base/include.
As a quick test, pass
<tt  >-I/opt/lsbdev-base/include</tt> to GCC
and see what happens. The compiler wrapper described later does this step and some
other related steps for you.
</p><p>
Once you have compiled your code, the next step and next test is to link
the code together to form the final application. Usually, this step looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -o app1 obj1.o obj2.o -lfoo
</pre>
</p><p>
The LSB stub libraries can be found in /opt/lsbdev-base/lib
and can be specified by passing the -L option to the compiler.
These stub libraries are used only at link time. Typically, the normal system
libraries are used at runtime. Again, the compiler wrapper described later
handles these details for you.
</p><p>
Once you have linked your application, use the
<tt  >ldd</tt> command to see what shared libraries are being used. At this point, there
should not be any shared libraries other than the ones specified in the
LSB (and listed in the &ldquo;Linux Standard Base Libraries&rdquo; sidebar). If there are, you need to take extra steps
to make them be linked statically. Usually, the
<tt  >-Wl,-Bstatic</tt>
and <tt  >-Wl,-Bdynamic</tt> options can be used to specify that
certain libraries should be linked statically. By now, you may be seeing
a
pattern: the compiler wrapper handles this for you.
</p><p>
As an example, here is what the application xpdf typically looks like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ldd /usr/bin/xpdf
  libXpm.so.4 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4
  libt1.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/libt1.so.1
  libfreetype.so.6 =&gt; /usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6
  libSM.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libSM.so.6
  libICE.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libICE.so.6
  libX11.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6
  libpaper.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/libpaper.so.1
  libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 =&gt;
         /usr/lib/libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3
  libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libm.so.6
  libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6
  /lib/ld-linux.so.2 =&gt; /lib/ld-linux.so.2
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x1e0f8f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Here is the LSB-conforming xpdf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ldd /opt/lsb-xpdf/bin/xpdf
    libSM.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libSM.so.6
    libICE.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libICE.so.6
    libX11.so.6 =&gt; /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6
    libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libm.so.6
    libgcc_s.so.1 =&gt; /lib/libgcc_s.so.1
    libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6
    /lib/ld-lsb.so.1 =&gt; /lib/ld-lsb.so.1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x1e0fa50"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The non-LSB libraries are not showing up as
needed by the application, because they
are linked statically into the application
itself. There is a trade-off here: the
application executable becomes larger, but it has fewer
dependencies on the installed operating system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x1e0fb58"></a>
Making It Easy</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, we get to the compiler wrapper, lsbcc and
lsbc++. These are the same program; they simply are invoked with
different names to indicate C or C++ mode. The general idea
is you can use lsbcc wherever you would use GCC and lsbc++ wherever
you would use g++.
</p><p>
This wrapper tool parses all of the options passed to it and rearranges
them slightly.
It then inserts a few extra options to cause the LSB-supplied headers and
libraries to be used ahead of the normal system libraries. This tool
also recognizes non-LSB libraries and forces them to be linked statically.
</p><p>
Because the LSB-supplied headers and libraries are inserted into the head
of the search paths, it generally is safe to use things not in the
LSB.
Make sure, however, that they are not dependent on something that intentionally has been left
out of the LSB headers and libraries and that they can be linked statically into the
applications. This allows lsbcc to be transparent in most cases.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x2207fb8"></a>
Using the LSB Development Environment</h2></div></div><p>
With the LSB development packages installed, porting a sample application
becomes as easy as the normal three-step process, but with a slight difference:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CC=lsbcc ./configure
make
make install
</pre>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x2208118"></a></h2></div></div><p>
By telling the configure script to use lsbcc instead of GCC, it
conducts its various tests in an LSB environment and configures the software
with any adjustments or limitations that may be required. Sometimes this results
in a portable replacement for a feature being used. Generally, though, the overall
functionality is close to what it would have been if GCC were
used instead. As an exercise, try running a configure script both ways and
compare the results. Another benefit of telling configure to use lsbcc
is that it automatically sets CC to lsbcc in the generated
makefiles, so you don't have to remember to pass it
in (<tt  >make CC=lsbcc</tt>) every time you run
<tt  >make</tt>.
</p><p>
The lsbcc command defaults to calling GCC with the modified arguments, but an
environment variable can be used to tell it what compiler to use instead. This
should work okay for any other compiler that is command-line option compatible
with GCC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x2208328"></a>
Testing Tool</h2></div></div><p>
Once the application has been built, use
the lsbappchk program to test
the program to see if it conforms to the LSB. This
program checks the list of shared libraries
used by your application; it also checks to make
sure you are using only the interfaces permitted
by the LSB. Here is an example run:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# /opt/lsbappchk/bin/lsbappchk /bin/ls
/opt/lsbappchk/bin/lsbappchk for LSB Specification 1.3.3
Checking binary /bin/ls
Incorrect program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux.so.2
Header[ 1] PT_INTERP    Failed
Found wrong interpreter in .interp section: /lib/ld-linux.so.2
                               instead of: /lib/ld-lsb.so.1
DT_NEEDED: librt.so.1 is used, but not part of the LSB
Symbol clock_gettime used, but not part of LSB
</pre>
</p><p>
The LSB does not require that the utilities provided by the OS be
LSB-conforming themselves. Therefore, there isn't really an expectation that
a distribution's own /bin/ls should pass this test. It simply makes for a
handy example.
</p><p>
The output of lsbappchk tells us that /bin/ls is not an LSB-conforming
application. The first problem is it wasn't linked with the LSB-defined
program interpreter /lib/ld-lsb.so.1. The next problem is that the application
is looking for the shared library librt.so.1, which is not included in the
set of LSB-defined libraries. Lastly, the function clock_gettime() is used
but is not linked statically to the application (it would have been found in
librt.so.1).
</p><p>
The general approach to fixing an application
such as this would be to rebuild the application
using lsbcc, which would set the program interpreter
correctly and cause librt.a to be used instead of
librt.so. Sometimes, statically linking a library
can cause new non-LSB symbols to be brought into
the application, so this process may have to be
repeated a couple of times.
</p><p>
In some larger applications or in sets of related
applications, it may be desirable to create
shared libraries that are used only by these
applications. This is permissible under the LSB
as long as the shared library is installed as
part of the application and it resides in the
application private data area, not
in any of the system library locations.
The -L option to lsbappchk lets
you tell the testing tool the full path to the
shared library, which is considered to be a
part of the application for the purpose of testing
conformance to the LSB. Here is an example of
an LSB-conforming build of the Apache Web server,
which uses three private shared libraries:


<pre     class="programlisting">

# /opt/lsbappchk/bin/lsbappchk \
  -L /opt/lsb-apache/lib/libaprutil.so.0 \
  -L /opt/lsb-apache/lib/libexpat.so.0 \
  -L /opt/lsb-apache/lib/libapr.so.0 \
  /opt/lsb-apache/sbin/httpd
/opt/lsbappchk/bin/lsbappchk for LSB Specification 1.3.3
Adding symbols for library /opt/lsb-apache/lib/libaprutil.so.0
Adding symbols for library /opt/lsb-apache/lib/libexpat.so.0
Adding symbols for library /opt/lsb-apache/lib/libapr.so.0
Checking binary /opt/lsb-apache/sbin/httpd

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x22086f0"></a>
Packaging</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned earlier, the LSB specifies that a package must be delivered in
the RPM file format. This does not mean that RPM has to be used to build or
package your application, although it may be the most practical option, depending on
whether you already are using it. Other options would be creating
the package in the Debian format, and then using alien to convert it to
RPM.
Or, you could use some other tool for creating the RPM file format. We have the
beginnings of a tool called mkpkg to create the RPM format file, but it
likely will require something to sit on top of it to make it
useful to any but the most die-hard hacker.
</p><p>
In our application battery, we currently build the application and install it
in a temporary root and then invoke RPM to package up the install application.
This may seem a little clunky, but it works without much pain and produces
more consistent results across all of the different versions of RPM
found in the wild.
</p><p>
Here is a sample spec file for the xpaint application:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Summary: An X Window System paint program
Summary: XPaint
Name: lsb-xpaint
Version: 2.6.2
Release: 3
Vendor: Free Standards Group
License: MIT
Group: Appbat/graphics
Buildroot: /usr/src/appbat/pkgroot/lsb-xpaint
AutoReqProv: no
PreReq: lsb &gt;= 1.3

%description
LSB conforming version of xpaint. XPaint is an
X Window System color image editing program and
painting program. Xpaint is added to the LSB
Application Battery primarily to demonstrate the
use of X11 libraries.

%pre

%install

%post

%preun

%postun

%clean

%files

%attr ( - bin bin ) /opt/lsb-xpaint
</pre>
</p><p>
Full source code for building and packaging this and the other applications
in the application battery can be found in the LSB Project CVS tree.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x2208958"></a>
Does This Really Work?</h2></div></div><p>
Yes, it really does work, although to be fair, we still are running into
corner cases and various applications that don't always follow the rules for
clean, portable code. As part of the verification for
the LSB, we have created an application battery built from the tools
described here. This set of applications includes Apache, Samba, Lynx, Python,
xpdf and groff. We have tried to select a set of real applications that
provide coverage over as much of the LSB set of interfaces as possible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x2208a60"></a>
What about C++ Applications?</h2></div></div><p>
LSB version 1.3 does not support C++, so the rule requiring the library to be
linked statically applies. We are adding support for C++ to LSB 2.0 to avoid
this. We provide the lsbdev-c++ package, which contains a version of
libstdc++ that was configured and built with lsbcc. This and GCC version 3.2
seem to produce good results. We have tried other combinations of compilers and
different versions of the C and C++ libraries but ran into various problems,
depending on the nature of the application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d16580.0x2208b68"></a>
Future Directions</h2></div></div><p>
For the LSB in general, we will continue to add additional libraries to the
specification as long as there is consensus that they are needed and have
reached a certain level of stability. This should help close the gap between
how distribution-provided and LSB-conforming applications are built.
</p><p>
For the LSB development environment, we will continue to make the tools
better and more transparent. The development environment is being
maintained actively, and feedback from people using these tools is appreciated. With
the addition of C++ in LSB 2.0, the development environment will be able to
drop the lsbdev-c++ package being used today in favor
of the C++ stub library, which will move into the base LSB development package.
</p><p>
Currently, you may have to set several options in an rpmrc or rpmmacros file
to make RPM produce LSB-conforming packages. It is our hope that we can
come up with an LSB mode for rpmbuild that can handle all of
this automatically. Hopefully, it will make it even easier to build
existing packages that conform to the LSB.
