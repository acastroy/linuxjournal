If you're keeping a proprietary OS around just to run the
accounting software, you're missing a chance to step up to
the flexible, better-supported alternative.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7d2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Back in the late 1990s, I started looking for a good accounting software package for
Linux. I was disappointed by all the offerings I found; none was up to
snuff or even looked like it might ever be. Then, about three and a half
years ago, I stumbled on SQL-Ledger (SL) written by Dieter Simader (see
the &ldquo;Making Open Source Work&rdquo; sidebar).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7d450"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Making Open Source Work</b></p><p>
Dieter Simader is the author of SQL-Ledger. He started the project four
years ago. His software has taken off since then, and he now works on SL
full-time.
He's made his open-source project, released under the GPL with no cost to
others to use, his primary source of income.
</p><p>
So how does one make a living off free software? If you visit the SL
site, you can see that Dieter offers support contracts, which are all
reasonably priced. His software is of high quality, and his offerings
include data conversion, pay-as-you-play support and support for the
development version if you need the more advanced features.
He also sells the software manual that tells you not only how to use his
program but how to customize screens for all users or for certain
users, using SL's API.
</p><p>
These value-added features are well worth the price and should be
considered essential for any business. Although businesses can hire someone
else to do what Dieter does, including supporting the software, customizing templates and importing data,
few could do the work as well as Dieter.
</p><p>
As a consultant, my clients usually want to deal with me, not someone
on another continent whom they don't know. For that convenience, they are willing
to pay a premium. So I tack a small percentage on to Dieter's price,
pay Dieter and we're both happy. He gets work and is paid for
supporting his program. I get an annoyance fee, because my clients
will annoy me if the software doesn't work to their satisfaction.
This model also serves as a good way to expand
into markets where the author doesn't speak the language, so
additional revenue also serves as a translation fee.
SQL-Ledger is proof that open-source business models can work.
</p></div><p>
To be honest, at first glance I thought SQL-Ledger wasn't yet an offering
for a serious business. It lacked point of sale (POS), payroll and
a number of other features. But, based on its ease of installation,
its flexibility and a number of other factors, not the least of which
was the author's rather ambitious to-do list, I tried it out.
</p><p>
I used SQL-Ledger for my IT consulting business, Pananix, SA, and it proved
to be more than adequate.
I could input customers and vendors, create invoices and
orders, and print basic reports, including trial balance, income statement
and balance sheet. SL even had rudimentary support for goods and
services reports covering product inventory and services.
</p><p>
Because I currently live in a Spanish-speaking country,
I anticipated problems. I'm not familiar with Spanish accounting terms,
but the laws of this country require that the program interface and all
statements and reports be in Spanish for the natives and tax auditors.
Fortunately, SL is written in such a way that users can choose
the language they require. That means I can see everything in English, while my
accountant and the local tax authorities see Spanish&mdash;perfectly legal.
If a language doesn't exist, it can be added easily. This feature was
not well supported in any other accounting package I looked at and was
a major factor for me in choosing SL.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7d870"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Installation was a breeze back when I first looked at SL, but
it's even easier now. The biggest stumbling block for most
people involves the few requisite Perl modules for database support.
A second stumbling block comes with the configuration of PostgreSQL itself,
but all these are covered in the instructions and FAQ. As long as they
are followed to the letter, even newbies shouldn't have any
difficulty. The problems seem to arise when folks wander off on their
own and deliberately or accidentally make changes affecting
permissions, occasionally permissions on the database itself.
</p><p>
Once Perl and whatever supported database you want to use are set
up, the rest is easy. MySQL is not supported and will
be only when it provides certain parts of the SQL-92 standard it is now
missing. PostgreSQL is the database used for design and testing,
but Oracle and DB2 also work.
</p><p>
You also need to configure your Web server of choice to access SL,
but that involves only copying a few lines to httpd.conf
and restarting it. If you install SL under your DocumentRoot,
even this step can be omitted, as long as you can run CGI scripts
from below your DocumentRoot. If you want to print reports to disk
as PDF files, you need to make sure you have LaTeX installed.
</p><p>
The currently recommended installation practice for SL itself is to
use the author's supplied setup.pl file to handle everything for you. This
makes it difficult to go wrong, and the script also is used to upgrade SL.
The author recently included code to test the database itself during
upgrades to ensure you don't have version mismatches between the database
and the code. If you do, it automatically upgrades it (nice touch, that).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7da80"></a>
Configuration and Security</h2></div></div><p>
Those of you who follow my writings know that I consider security
to be job number one. Accountants out there should be pleased to know
that security in SL can be implemented on a user-by-user basis.
Therefore, one user can see only Accounts Payable while another can see
only Accounts Receivable.
</p><p>
SL also can be configured to comply with generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). Most countries have their own version of GAAP,
but these practices are similar. You therefore can configure SL so users can't
go back and delete transactions but must post reversing entries instead. You
also can close periods so nothing can be edited in prior periods.
</p><p>
All this is accomplished in the administration section where you add
users and basically tell the system how you want it to act. After
that, it's up to you. The FAQ contains information to assist you
in tightening security on your system. Basically, you decide how
secure or open your system will be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7dc38"></a>
Running SQL-Ledger</h2></div></div><p>
SL is easy to use and fairly simple to customize in any
way you need. Everything in SL revolves around its Chart of Accounts.
When you set up SL, you choose one to load. But making changes to that
one or even creating a new one is not difficult. In fact, many businesses
probably will want to sit down and make some modifications.
</p><p>
The way SL's tax system is set up, almost any tax system can be
configured easily, simply by linking from one table to another using the
tax percentage. The ease with which this can be done makes it ideal
for locations where the tax structure might require two or three separate
taxes be applied to a sale. The Default Chart of Accounts is set up with
three tax accounts just to show how it is done. Tax tables contain multiple
links to customers, vendors, parts and services, and a match determines
whether tax is applied or not. AR and AP are independent from one another,
and in combination with tax settings for customers, vendors' parts and
service, you have a very flexible model to calculate tax. You even can set
up negative taxes to calculate tax withholdings at source or tax on tax.
The tax system here
requires that I charge taxes on services tied to the sale of a taxable
item; otherwise, I don't charge tax on purely a service offering. So I had
to create a service call that was nontaxable and one that was taxable.
</p><p>
So that customers don't notice that I sometimes charge tax on
a service but other times I don't, and because the taxable service
always was tied to a hardware sale, I simply created an installation
package that included the hardware and taxable service with the
entire bundle being taxed. I haven't seen a single other accounting
package for Linux that offers me this kind of flexibility.
</p><p>
SL can be accessed from any system with a Web browser, text or graphical,
from anywhere you can reach the SL server by HTTP or HTTPS. If, like most
people, you're using a graphical browser,
after login you see two frames. The one on the left contains a
menu broken down into several sections with items below them, and the
one on the right contains a main
screen where you can enter data.
</p><p>
One of the first things I do after each upgrade is
<tt  >cd</tt> into the bin/mozilla
directory and edit menu.pl to widen the menubar. For me, it's a
little too narrow, and making it about 35 pixels wider makes it
more pleasing to my eyes. For those of you who use a
text browser, like Lynx, that doesn't render frames, the
menu headings are at the bottom of the page.
</p><p>
The major headings that show up depend on the user's configuration
from the admin page. Entire menu headings can be removed or only
specific items. So any given user's menubar may look a bit sparser
than that shown in the screen captures, depending on setup and version
in use. The screenshot in Figure 1 clearly shows this is Version 2.3.1,
a development version. It is slightly more feature-rich than the stable
version, but its designation as unstable warns you it hasn't
been as thoroughly tested as the stable version. Major menu headings
include AR, POS, AP, Cash, HR, Order Entry, Shipping, Quotations,
General Ledger, Goods &amp; Services, Projects and Reports.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7290f1.large.jpg"><img src="7290f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. SQL-Ledger Start Page
</p></div></div><p>
You also can see some menu items followed by ellipses.
Those bring up even more detailed submenu items. In the case of System...,
a long list is brought up in later versions.
</p><p>
Taking a quick look at AR Reports, selecting Reports expands the menu
list. Then selecting Transactions provides a screen to define the
transactions we want to see and the information we want presented; see
Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7290f2.large.jpg"><img src="7290f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. AR Transactions Query Screen
</p></div></div><p>
Notice the Customer window at the top of the browser window in Figure 2.
In a number of screens, this can be either a drop-down list or
a pick list in a separate window. Better yet, this presentation is
configurable by each user. So users who like drop-down lists and don't
mind that the list scrolls 16 pages off the bottom of the screen can
put a large number in their pick-list preference. Those that want
a smaller, more sane list, can get a drop-down list unless the number
of available items for the drop-down list exceeds the limit. Then,
they simply can put in a few letters of the name for which they're
searching,
refresh the screen and get a small pick list, as shown in Figure 3.
This particular pick list came up from an invoice screen after entering
<tt  >maint</tt> in the part number window and selecting Update.

For those of you interested in playing with SL without going
to the trouble of setting it up, I suggest you head over to
<a href="http://www.sql-ledger.com" target="_self">www.sql-ledger.com</a>. A few demo systems are available, so
folks can try before they install the software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7e688"></a>
Using SQL-Ledger in Your Business</h2></div></div><p>
I'm not an accountant, and I barely get by with my accounting duties as it is.
As with most powerful accounting software, you should know something
about it before using it. But if it's an accounting question, I probably don't have
the answer.
</p><p>
Fortunately, except for the few times I may have to wade into
general ledger, the system takes care of itself. I've found the
customer list to be quite friendly. It serves as both a customer
list and a way to keep e-mail addresses straight. I e-mail monthly
bills, and this program has made that particularly easy. In fact,
after posting, you can call up a bill and e-mail it with a single
click. The program handles it all for you, including sending a cover letter.
</p><p>
Purchase orders are as easy to do, and they also can be e-mailed directly
from the interface. When orders come in it's a few more clicks
to enter inventory and create the payable. A quick trip to Cash&rarr;Payments and we're done.
</p><p>
If you have several businesses, you can run as many ledgers as you want using
different database names. You also have to use different user names, one
for each, but I've found the easy way to do this is to make the user name
a combined user/company name. You may think of something more convenient.
</p><p>
Now that the latest SL includes POS, you can connect a bar-code reader
and use that to enter items on the screen. SL was designed
deliberately with the UPDATE button first, so scanning a bar code fills in a product
number then updates that to fill in the rest of the line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c7e948"></a>
Coming Attractions?</h2></div></div><p>
SL is now fairly feature-rich these days, especially compared to several
years ago, but the author maintains an ambitious to-do list. By the time you
read this, in fact, SL even may contain payroll. Most of the tables and
links are in place; it appears to be a matter of coding and testing.
I fully expect a payroll system to rival any available,
based on what's come before in SL.
</p><p>
The SL to-do list includes such items as:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Budgets: comparisons to actual ones and also to enforce budget (expense)
constraints.
</p></li><li><p>
Manufacturing: finished goods and goods-in-process inventory; material
and human resources planning.
</p></li><li><p>
Lot allocation: repackaging bulk goods into smaller portions; memorized
transactions and custom reports.
</p></li><li><p>
Batch form generation: invoices, orders and other forms for batch
printing.
</p></li><li><p>
Financial reports: more comparison options, such as month-to-month.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c75700"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Those interested can take a look at SL's What's Ahead page.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c75808"></a>
Support</h2></div></div><p>
SL offers a range of support for the software. From the SL home
page you can find several users lists in a variety of languages.
Currently six user lists exist. The author lurks on the English list.
He occasionally posts to clear up misunderstandings.
</p><p>
Paid support also is available at extremely reasonable rates.
A wide variety of support options are available, and most
come with a copy of the SQL-Ledger users manual. If you want to use
this software without support, that's fine. But as with all
GPL software, if you break it, you get to keep both pieces. Paid
support is your assurance it doesn't break. A support
option is available to import old data from accounting packages that can
export tab-delimited text files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b85580.0x1c75968"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Although changing accounting packages always is an ordeal, SL is one
package worth investigating. The price can't be beat, and this software
competes against and beats many proprietary offerings. And if you
don't see it but need it, you always can request a feature.
