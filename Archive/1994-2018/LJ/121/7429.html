One little Web site about a
batty lawsuit became the tech news hit of the year. And
Internet research can help clear the next legal minefield too.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd87580.0xe7f240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Open legal research isn't a phrase in law dictionaries.
Law firms normally are secretive and keep everything
very hush-hush. What we've been doing at Groklaw is
pioneering work, what Open Source Risk Management's
Daniel Egger called &ldquo;a new kind of collaborative,
real-time, you-can't-get-away-from-us legal resource&rdquo;.
The Internet makes it possible.
</p><p>
Like a lot of ideas that turn out really to work, it
was supposed to be something else but morphed.
When I started, it was only me, one geeky paralegal
who didn't like what The SCO Group was trying to
do to Linux and decided to help. SCO seemed to
be pursuing a strategy of delaying any test of its
claims in court, while at the same time maximizing
fear, uncertainty and doubt about Linux. A lot of
my early work was finding evidence to rebut SCO's
public statements&mdash;anti-FUD, if you will. I also
did detailed research that I hoped would be helpful
and interesting.
</p><p>
Readers started to show up, first a trickle, then
a flood. Groklaw today has more than 4,500 members
and a readership in the millions. Some of
the volunteers knew things I didn't, especially about
the code issues, but they didn't realize what they
knew was useful legally.
I decided to show them how to do legal research and
how to identify useful evidence, so I posted legal
research guides and links to sites and explained
terminology, such as &ldquo;promissory estoppel&rdquo; or &ldquo;slander
of title&rdquo;, by quoting from lawyers and judges and
providing links to more information.
</p><p>
Groklaw's readers include direct witnesses to or
even central participants in events described in
court filings and public statements. When SCOForum
happened and the debate began on what the code was,
I simply wrote to Dennis Ritchie and asked him.
When SCO claimed to
own C++, I wrote to its author, Dr Bjarne
Stroustrup, and he denied it publicly. When they
claimed the ABI files, Warrren Toomey from the
UNIX Heritage Society wrote a rebuttal article.
The experts are alive and able to testify.
</p><p>
My volunteer Webmaster, Peter Roozemaal, switched
Groklaw to Geeklog software and wrote some needed
features to facilitate collaborative work. We have
groups for different projects. I invite some to take
on more responsibilities. &ldquo;Dr Stupid&rdquo;, for example,
is my primary lieutenant now on all code articles.
</p><p>
One group tracks court postings of legal documents.
Others go to the courthouse for paper-only exhibits, while
another group OCRs, another proofreads and others
research. Another group works on the quotation database,
under Leif Jensen. Still another group transcribes
press conferences and other events. IBM cited
the group's Groklaw work in support of a motion it
later won.
</p><p>
Attorneys, including Eben Moglen, Dan Ravicher,
Mark Webbink, Dennis Karjala, Webster Knight, Lewis
Mettler, Anupam Chander and others have helped with
articles, interviews and behind-the-scenes news.
</p><p>
To offer one example of group research and
interacting with living experts, one group of more
than a dozen, led by Alex Roston, collected evidence
showing that an important contributor to the Linux
kernel was Tigran Aivazian, at the time an &ldquo;old
SCO&rdquo; employee. He worked on some of the high-end
functionality issues involved in the IBM case. Aivazian not
only reviewed the draft of the Groklaw article,
he went on the record that his contributions were
with the knowledge and permission of his supervisor,
explaining in writing that he &ldquo;requested permission
from Wendy (Development Director) before the release
under GPL and she confirmed that SCO has no claims
to this work whatsoever and has no objections to its
release under GPL&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Another group led by Frank Sorenson did an article
on Linux ABI files, which in my opinion undercut
SCO's ability to sue end users successfully. It was
a research volunteer, Rand McNatt, who discovered
that Novell was registering UNIX copyrights, a story
Groklaw broke.

What's Next?</h2></div></div><p>
The whole SCO drama is really a &ldquo;shot across the
bow&rdquo; for GNU/Linux, I believe, and I am sure
more nothing-to-lose companies will launch
suits against free/open-source code. I'm already
looking beyond SCO in my research for OSRM and
Groklaw.
</p><p>
We have begun a new project, the Unix History Timeline
Project. OSRM is donating a portion of my time to it.
This is a comprehensive oral history and documentation
project covering the important events in the licensing
and ownership history of UNIX. More than 30
other flavors of proprietary UNIX, other than AT&amp;T's, are available.
This is a call for anyone who wishes to send me
whatever you think might be relevant.
</p><p>
We are determined to find and clear any potential
minefields, if they exist. Within 48 hours of first
announcing the project, we had more than 400 volunteers,
including most of the published historians of UNIX
and many of the people who actually contributed to
UNIX in the first place. One wrote that I am now &ldquo;the
maintainer of the Linux anti-lawsuit kernel&rdquo;. That's
a good description of what our project is all about.
It's a nice compliment as well.
</p><p>
I also have asked Dan Ravicher of the Public Patent
Foundation to cover patents for Groklaw in the
future. Our method obviously is well suited to finding
prior art. If other attorneys wish to contribute to
Groklaw, please contact me.
</p><p>
People are hungry to understand legal news, and they
want to help. I believe open legal research works
and that there will be many more projects like ours
in the future. Groklaw is the proof of concept.
