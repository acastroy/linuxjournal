<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #121, May 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

The <span   class="bold"><b>FAT filesystem</b></span> still is being maintained,
and, in fact, <span   class="bold"><b>Frodo Looijaard</b></span> recently
has added Linux
support for some obscure FAT implementations
that required unusual characters to delineate the
directory index. One problem with FAT maintenance
is the proliferation of implementations that should
be supported under Linux. Another is that the MS-DOS
version may not always clearly obey the official
specification itself; in which case, as <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter
Anvin</b></span> has put it, the rule always should be to follow the
WWDD rule (What Would DOS Do). The question of when
to adhere to standards and when to slough them off
in favor of something better is a perennial one in
the free software world.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michael A. Halcrow</b></span> has begun work on an encrypted
filesystem. According to his initial research, the
best method will be to create an entirely seamless
encryption layer above the root filesystem, with files
marked as either encrypted or clear. Encryption keys
associate with files as opposed to directories or
block devices and so forth, but a directory can be tagged
encrypted only, in which case all files within it
are encrypted by default. Key and other metadata
will be stored inside Extended Attributes. Standard
file data, such as file size and permissions, will be
encrypted, as far as is possible. Deleted files will
be wiped from the disk as thoroughly as they can
to reduce the possibility of recovery. A number of
other interesting features appear to be in the offing
as well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Vojtech Pavlik</b></span> has produced an FAQ for problems
encountered with <span   class="bold"><b>Input drivers</b></span>. It covers such issues
as how to get a list of Input drivers on the system,
how to deal with mouse or keyboard misbehavior
and many others. This is the
first time these problems have been documented since
the Input layer was rewritten during 2.5 development,
and a lot of folks are overjoyed to
have a central repository where their questions can
be answered.
</p><p>
Ever since the <span   class="bold"><b>IDE</b></span> driver was rewritten, amid
much turmoil and upheaval in the 2.5 development tree,
efforts to fix its ability to be loaded as an external
module have been put off until the rest of its code
could stabilize. <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> in particular rejected
various patches from various developers attempting
to make IDE loadable as a module. A recent attempt
by <span   class="bold"><b>Witold Krecicki</b></span> seemed like a good attempt, but
it looks like <span   class="bold"><b>Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz</b></span>'s patch is
more likely to get into the 2.6 tree in the near
future. Having worked intensively on the IDE driver
during the 2.5 cycle, he's apparently been developing
the loadable module patch for some time, and feels
it adequately covers all the corner- and edge-cases.
</p><p>
It turns out that some of the <span   class="bold"><b>mailing
lists</b></span>
listed in the MAINTAINERS file as being the proper
place to submit bug reports on various features
actually require that users subscribe to the
lists before posting their reports. This is not
uncommon in the realm of mailing lists, but for
Linux kernel development, it has been decided that all
bug-receiving lists listed in the MAINTAINERS file
must receive posts from anyone. This is
the best way to welcome regular users to
submit their bug reports. One of the main reasons
to require subscription before posting has been the
proliferation of spam and the attempt to keep it out
of a development mailing list. Although there are various
ways of dealing with that problem, it also has been
decided that not all mailing lists in MAINTAINERS must
be completely open, as long as they have a secondary
list that does remain open to all bug reports.
</p><p>
A new port of the Linux kernel, called <span   class="bold"><b>Cooperative
Linux</b></span>, has sprung up. Similar to User-Mode
Linux (UML), Cooperative Linux is not a port to any
particular hardware architecture but is intended to
create a running Linux system on top of an existing
system. Cooperative Linux already has run
on an instance of <span   class="bold"><b>Windows 2000</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Windows
XP</b></span> successfully. The Cooperative Linux developers hope
this will allow many users of other OSes to try Linux
without the burden of having to replace their existing
systems with complete Linux installations. Apparently,
multiple instances of Cooperative Linux can run
in parallel on a single system, and efforts toward
running Cooperative Linux on top of Linux itself
already are underway.

<h2 class="title">World-Record Distributed Chess Project</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Carlos Justiniano</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #121, May 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

On January 30, 2004, one of the world's top chess
players, International Grandmaster Peter Nielsen,
faced a distributed computing cluster called
ChessBrain in an unprecedented man-vs-machine
event. ChessBrain fought back as it navigated
well-placed traps in a game that resulted in a draw.
</p><p>
The ChessBrain Project plays live chess games in real
time, using distributed computing techniques similar
to SETI@home and distributed.net. A central Linux-based server called a SuperNode coordinates thousands
of distributed machines called PeerNodes.
</p><p>
Interest in the event was significantly greater than
anticipated. As a result, a large number of PeerNodes
descended on the SuperNode in a situation that
resembled a denial-of-service attack. To address this
potentially fatal situation, ChessBrain member Gavin
Roy tweaked /proc filesystem entries to modify the
TCP/IP stack's behavior. We also stopped the SuperNode
from Denmark and modified the SuperNode source code
to instruct remote PeerNodes to change the frequency
of their connection attempts. We were able to address
the situation in real time without rebooting a single
machine.
</p><p>
ChessBrain's official Guinness World Record attempt was hosted by
the Danish UNIX Users Group (DKUUG) at the Symbion Science Park in
Copenhagen, Denmark, and supported by the US-based Distributed
Computing Foundation.
With a new record involving 2,070 computers from 56
different countries, ChessBrain has become the first
distributed network to play a game against a single
human opponent. This gives new meaning to &ldquo;Powered
by Linux!&rdquo;

Have you tried other ticket tracking systems and found that they're too complex
or that they don't keep you and your customers in contact well enough?
This ticket tracking system is simple to use for both customers
and technicians, and it e-mails responses to customers so they know
immediately when their request was processed. If you need a simple,
easy-to-use tracking system, this might be the one for you.
Requires: Web server; Perl; Perl modules CGI, DBI, Net::SMTP, Socket,
File::Copy; and PostgreSQL.

This is a real-time blacklist module
for iptables/Netfilter. If you run one or more mail
servers, you can save processing
time by running this module on your Linux router.
The module can check incoming port 25 connections
against the spam blacklists and drop those packets
before your mail servers even see them.
Requires: libdotconf and glibc.
