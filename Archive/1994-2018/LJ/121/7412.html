Fight spam now and prepare to eliminate it in the
future.

Get a bunch of Linux professionals together these days and
the topic inevitably turns to the spam problem. How much do
you get, how many sneak through your filters and, of course,
what are the bad things that happened to you when a spam
filter decided to eat some important legitimate mail at the
worst possible time.
</p><p>
If you're just getting your personal e-mail via POP or IMAP,
spam might merely slow you down. But when you manage mail for
a lot of users it's now a major cost. A flood of unsolicited
bulk e-mail actually made an entire university's e-mail system
obsolete. The bad news is that spam unfairly shifts the cost
of marketing from senders to recipients. The good news is that
Ludovic Marcotte's team made that cost as low as possible
by deploying a reliable all-open-source mail system on Linux
and commodity hardware. When you read the success story on
page 44, notice that the site has planned to add more machines
as the spam problem gets worse.
</p><p>
But there is hope for the spam problem to get better in the
future. We won't go quite as ga-ga with &ldquo;the end of spam
is coming&rdquo; predictions as some tech CTOs, but we can make
spamming less lucrative for the perpetrators and maybe just
another Net nuisance.
</p><p>
SPF fights forged spam by giving other sites' mail servers
a way to check whether mail is really from you. Meng Weng Wong
covered how to label your mail server as legit in our last
issue, and now it's time to collect the benefits. Follow the
steps in both articles and you'll quickly block out all the
spam that claims to be from your own domain, then get more
effective protection as more sites use SPF. If you're joining
us in the middle, there's a link to the Web version of Part I.
</p><p>
System administration isn't all fun, glamour and beating
back hordes of slavering spammers to the sounds of cheers and
sighs of gratitude from spam-free users. So don't worry&mdash;we
cover the important behind-the-scenes tools in this issue too.
Now, time is only unidirectional in Stephen Hawking movies
and reality. On your RPM-based Linux system, you can go
back in time to correct a good upgrade gone bad. James Olin
Oden describes how to do transactions and rollback with RPM
on page 40.
</p><p>
If you want to get every last bit of the bandwidth you paid for,
but not go over and hit steeper charges, check out the article
by David Mandelstam and Nenad Corbic on page 54. Now you
easily can make your Net traffic use whichever connection
makes sense and use low-priced, small-business connections,
such as DSL and cable modems, where you can.
</p><p>
Let's just take a moment to give thanks for the spammers while
we have them. Think about it&mdash;we've learned to do groovy
text classifying math, we've developed knowledge of the SMTP
protocol and where future protocols can be better, and we've
given users a new appreciation of where they would be without
system administrators. Thanks, spammers.
</p><p>
Actually, no, on second thought, let's just put the parasites
out of business. Enjoy the issue.
