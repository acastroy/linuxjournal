Last month, we learned how to flag outgoing
e-mail as authentic using DNS. Now, it's time to
check incoming mail and protect our users from forged
spam and worms.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa2580.0x2b9a2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Sender Policy Framework (SPF) takes aim at the
practice of return-path spoofing, a technique
employed by worms, viruses and other senders of
unwanted mail. SPF consists of two parts. First, domain
administrators publish SPF records in the DNS. Those records
describe the servers the domain uses for outbound
mail. Then they are read by SPF-enabled MTAs. Mail coming
from a server not described in SPF can be considered
forged.
</p><p>
This article, the second of a two-part series, explains how
to add SPF capabilities to your mail server. It also
discusses how e-mail forwarding and Web-generated e-mail
services can adjust to SPF by performing sender rewriting.
</p><p>
This article was written in early February 2004 and reflects
the state of the Internet at that time. The MyDoom
worm, a virus that spoofs return-path addresses, recently had
littered millions of mailboxes with bogus bounce messages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa2580.0x2b9a4a8"></a>
It's Your Turn</h2></div></div><p>
Last month I described how to construct an SPF record, and DNS
administrators all over the world responded. First, they published
records, then crossed their fingers and waited. What
are they waiting for? They're waiting for you.
They've made it possible for you to distinguish their
legitimate mail easily from forgeries. Now it's your turn to help
them cut down on bogus bounces and abuse reports.
If you're just tuning in, see the on-line Resources section for last month's article and
an easy Web-based SPF wizard.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa2580.0x2b9a5b0"></a>
Adding SPF to Your MTA</h2></div></div><p>
The major mail transfer agents (MTAs) in the Linux
world are Sendmail, Postfix, Qmail and Exim. Although
most antispam vendors already have SPF support included in
their products or plan to add it in their next release,
MTAs tend to want to leave that task up to you. Most MTAs
offer an interface into which you can plug your antispam
tool.
</p><p>
SPF can be made to work in your MTA in two ways.
If you're the kind of sysadmin who prefers to compile your
own software, start at the SPF downloads page.


There you can find the SPF plugin that's right for your MTA, plus
detailed installation instructions.
If you prefer to manage your software using a package
system, you may find an SPF-enabled version of your MTA
already built and ready to install.
</p><p>
Most of the plugins rely on the reference Perl library
Mail::SPF::Query. You can install that library directly
from CPAN, or you can try to find a package for it. It
provides a simple program to run SPF queries at the command
line. It also provides a simple d&aelig;mon that handles SPF
query requests over a UNIX domain or inet socket.
</p><p>
By default, most of the plugins tell the MTA to reject
messages that fail SPF tests and add a Received-SPF header
to the rest. Conservative installations may prefer to
add the line <tt  >Received-SPF: fail</tt> instead of rejecting. This
configuration option is described in the plugin
documentation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa2580.0x2b9a818"></a>
Sendmail</h2></div></div><p>
Sendmail's plugin interface is called Milter (see on-line Resources). Recent
Sendmail versions have Milter capability compiled in by default.
Sendmail talks to Milter through a socket interface.
Sendmail tells Milter about the incoming SMTP
transaction, and Milter tells Sendmail what to do.
Milter runs as a d&aelig;mon and needs to be started separately.
</p><p>
Two Milters should be available at the SPF Web site: one in
Perl and one in C. The Perl version is a little more
mature, but if you need speed, the C version may be a better
choice.
</p><p>
To make Milter work with Sendmail, add
a couple of lines to your sendmail.mc file, rebuild
sendmail.cf and restart Sendmail.
</p><p>
If you'd rather not use Milter, libspf comes with a patch
that integrates SPF directly into Sendmail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa2580.0x2b9aa28"></a>
Postfix</h2></div></div><p>
Postfix 2.1 comes with a policy d&aelig;mon interface. It works
much like Milter does: Postfix connects to the d&aelig;mon and
provides a play-by-play commentary, and the d&aelig;mon returns an
action to Postfix. If you're running a recent development
snapshot of version 2.0, make sure you're using
2.0.18-20040122 or later.
</p><p>
Policy d&aelig;mons are configured in main.cf and master.cf.
They are managed by Postfix, which starts and stops them as
needed, so you don't need to worry about that.
The Postfix policy d&aelig;mon is written in Perl and calls the
standard Mail::SPF::Query library.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa2580.0x2b9ab88"></a>
Exim</h2></div></div><p>
Exim 4 introduced Access Control Lists (ACLs), a powerful and
compact mini-language for making antispam and other local
policy decisions. The ACL code that handles SPF for Exim is
only about 12 lines long.
</p><p>
You need to install the Mail::SPF::Query library and run
its SPF d&aelig;mon, which listens on a socket. The SPF ACL
connects to the spfd and reads it the client IP, HELO argument
and MAIL FROM sender address. It then receives an SPF result, a
response for the SMTP server and a Received-SPF header
line. You need to start the spfd separately.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa2580.0x2b9ace8"></a>
Qmail</h2></div></div><p>
Qmail does not have the same kind of plugin interface that
the other MTAs do. Instead, SPF provides a patch that
integrates SPF directly into Qmail. In addition,
many Qmail users screen their mail with qpsmtpd: if you
do, SPF is a plugin you can turn on easily.
</p><p>
James Couzens is the primary author of the C SPF library.
libspf comes with a patch for Qmail and for other MTAs as
well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa2580.0x2b9ae48"></a>
Testing the Plugin</h2></div></div><p>
Once you've installed the plugin and turned it on, you
should perform two tests.
First and most important, legitimate mail needs to get
through. If something broke, maybe you're not running
something you need to&mdash;double-check. If it's still broken,
back out the patch and report your experience to the
spf-help mailing list.
</p><p>
Second, confirm that forged mail is rejected. If
you can speak SMTP by hand, engineer a
message with MAIL FROM:&lt;linuxjournal-test@altavista.com&gt;.
The domain altavista.com is not used for mail, so it always
returns a FAIL message. They have asked that test messages contain
the word test. This can be tricky to execute because
if they recognize a trusted
client, both your MTA and SPF will turn a fail into a pass. Therefore, don't telnet to
localhost; use your machine's actual hostname, and if
possible try to open the connection from an outside host.
If you receive a 550 response and an error message that refers
to <a href="http://spf.pobox.com/why.html" target="_self">spf.pobox.com/why.html</a>, it's working.
</p><p>
If you use a secondary MX, tell your SPF
client not to reject its mail. How to do this is described in
detail in the installation instructions for your plugin.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa2580.0x2b9b058"></a>
Received-SPF: What the Codes Mean</h2></div></div><p>
You should notice that your mail now contains a Received-SPF
header that carries a number of result codes:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
NONE: the domain does not publish SPF records. Your
MTA should proceed as usual.
</p></li><li><p>
PASS: the mail is not forged, but that doesn't
mean it's legitimate. Remember, spammers can publish
SPF too. You still should test its domain against
a right-hand-side block list (RHSBL). But if the
sender is on your trusted whitelist, you can skip
further antispam checks with confidence.
</p></li><li><p>
FAIL: the mail is a forgery, and you can reject
it with confidence. There is a miniscule chance the
message is legitimate but was sent by a misconfigured
sender. In that case, the error message they receive
tells them they need to configure their MUA with SMTP
AUTH. SPF's design philosophy is that it's better to
fail obviously with a hearty error message than to
risk silently burying mail in a spambox.
</p></li><li><p>
SOFTFAIL: the message could be a forgery, but the
domain's ISP is working on switching its users to SMTP
AUTH, so the message could be legitimate. You should accept
the message, but subject it to more stringent antispam
checks.
</p></li><li><p>
NEUTRAL: the domain just has started down the road to
SPF, and their default response is <tt  >?all</tt>. They would like you
to pretend the response was <tt  >NONE</tt> while they consider
moving the default toward <tt  >SOFTFAIL</tt> and
<tt  >FAIL</tt>. Big ISPs
with millions of users move slowly; it's not their fault.
</p></li><li><p>
ERROR: there was a temporary DNS lookup error.
Normally, your MTA should return a <tt  >450 temporary
failure</tt>
when this happens.
</p></li><li><p>
UNKNOWN: a permanent error caused the
SPF lookup to abort; perhaps there was a syntax error in the
record, or maybe the record pointed to another domain that
doesn't have an SPF record.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2aa2580.0x2b9b840"></a>
The Price of SPF</h2></div></div><p>
In the past ten years we have grown tremendously dependent
on e-mail; we are made aware of just how dependent we are
every time a worm hits. Analysts routinely announce that
spam and viruses cost the economy billions of dollars. The
success of SPF shows that people are desperate for change.
</p><p>
But, change has its own price. If there were such a thing as a
painless solution to spam, we already would have adopted it.
The war on spam has dragged on so long in part because the
best experts on spam simply could not agree on exactly what
trade-offs they wanted to make, but that phase of debate is
drawing to a close. In every antispam future they have
discussed, sender authentication is the first and
fundamental step. Now, many possible sender
authentication models are available, but the designated-sender scheme
that SPF provides is probably the easiest to implement.
</p><p>
Cryptography definitely is in our future, but it's not
here yet. Like first aid, SPF offers immediate benefit, and
it's something we can do right away.
</p><p>
What is the price of SPF? Every designated sender scheme
breaks two things.
First, SPF breaks verbatim e-mail forwarding (Figure 1). Services that
provide permanent e-mail addresses, such as pobox.com,
are used to forward mail the way UNIX .forward and
/etc/aliases files do. When the mail leaves their
servers, the return-path address in the envelope is
unchanged. But in an SPF world, resent messages now look a
lot like forgeries. To fix this, forwarding services need
to rewrite their return paths. So do other sites that
depend on .forward and /etc/aliases to send mail off-site.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7328f1.large.jpg"><img src="7328f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Old-school e-mail forwarding breaks under SPF.
</p></div></div><p>
The solution is called SRS, sender rewriting scheme. It
encapsulates the original sender address in the rewritten,
SPF-compliant, return address. If a message should bounce,
it comes back to you, and you unwrap the address and forward
the bounce back to the sender. Forwarding services would
have to do this even in a world without SPF, because
ISPs already are performing pseudo-SPF checks. SPF simply
gave everyone a standard way to do what they already were doing
piecemeal. In the same way that
responsible sites closed down their open relays over the past few years,
in the
coming months responsible sites will begin to operate
SRS-compliant forwarding; pobox.com already is doing SRS, and
other forwarding services are expected to follow.
</p><p>
The good news is the community that developed SPF
already has produced SRS code for your MTA. Those patches are
available from the same place you got your SPF patches. By
the time you read this, they even might be bundled into your
MTA. The goal is for the average installation to be able to
upgrade to the latest version and have SRS magically
work (see Resources).
</p><p>
So, this solves the e-mail forwarding problem. Getting
SRS into the field is simply a matter of time.
But SPF also breaks Web-generated e-mail. Greeting card
sites and &ldquo;e-mail me this news article&rdquo; sites tend to use
your e-mail address not only in the From: header but in the
envelope sender too. In SPF terms, that kind of behaviour
is indistinguishable from forgery.
</p><p>
To solve this problem, those sites can do one
of two things.
First, if the mail they send isn't that important, they
can set the return-path address to nobody@example.com
and eat the bounces. Newer, more progressive sites, such as
Orkut, already do something like this.
But if the mail is important, was sent on behalf of a
user who was logged in to the Web site properly, and if the
Web site had previously confirmed the user's e-mail address,
then the Web site could perform SRS <span   class="emphasis"><em>on itself</em></span>&mdash;encapsulating the user's return address so that bounces
would be properly forwarded.
</p><p>
What about the transition period, you ask. Won't there
be a time of disruption while the forwarders groan their way
toward SRS-compliance? What about the sites that are
unwilling or slow to adapt?
</p><p>
Well, here's a little secret. We have a fairly good idea
who the major culprits are; we know, for instance, that eBay
sometimes sends mail with a legitimately forged envelope
return-path. The people who developed SPF use eBay, too,
and they don't want to lose e-mail any more than you do.
So they came up with a hack. They set up a whitelist that
identifies all these legitimate forgers; pobox.com is on
the list, as are acm.org, eBay and the
newspaper Web sites that do &ldquo;e-mail me this article&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Every SPF client we've talked about in this article knows
about that whitelist. Every SPF client we know of gives that whitelist a chance to override a fail. If your
mother sends mail from her AOL account to your acm.org
address, your SPF client accepts that message, even
though it's technically a forgery. (If you get forwarded
mail through a system that's not on the list&mdash;from, say,
a friend's home Linux box&mdash;you should whitelist that
box in your MTA.) When acm.org implements SRS, the problem
will go away.
</p><p>
SPF's critics tend to say &ldquo;it breaks forwarding&rdquo;. The SPF
community rose to the occasion and did their best to ease
the transition. They offered two solutions, one short-term
and one long-term, that meet in the middle. Together they
sugarcoat the bitter pill.
</p><p>
Change means pain. The transition to an SPF world won't be
painless, but it's like the pain of an injection that makes
the illness go away. E-mail is very sick. Some say it will
not survive spam, but I don't agree. I think SPF will set it
firmly on the road to recovery.
