I've been a Linux user and <i  >Linux Journal</i> subscriber
since the mid-1990s. I recently converted our home
Internet machine to Linux after one too many virus
attacks. Since the conversion, we've had zero
problems with viruses and worms. Last week, my wife
and I were in Funchal, Madeira, looking for an Internet
caf&eacute; so we could e-mail our kids. The place we found
had the attached ad in their window. Thought you'd
get a chuckle out of it.

Advertiser Should Check Facts</h4><p>
The cartoon on page 27 [<span   class="emphasis"><em>advertisement for Hentzenwerke
Publishing&mdash;Ed.</em></span>] bothered me because it is just so
blatantly inaccurate. Opera, Firebird, WordPerfect
and RealPlayer all are available for Windows, and
some premiered on that platform.
There are plenty of reasons why Linux is great without
having to make up stuff!

I have subscribed to your magazine for about a year and a half, and
I love it. I have learned so much from it. I wanted to send you a
picture of my son with a Tux shirt my wife embroidered for him. Linux is
very popular here and all my kids are getting an early start. Thanks.

Quality Grammar</h4><p>
I wanted to drop you a line to express my appreciation
for the extra effort you folks appear to be making
relative to the use of proper grammar. The absence
of split infinitives and the correct positioning of
the word only right next to the word or phrase
it is intended to modify (rather than as early as
possible in the sentence, a horribly bad practice that
often thoroughly confuses the author's meaning)
are just two examples of the high standard you are
following. Thank you&mdash;some of us out here really do notice
the difference.

More Air Traffic Success</h4><p>
Thanks for the article on Linux in Air Traffic Control
in the January 2004 <i  >LJ</i>. Tom Brusehaver is quite
right&mdash;Linux
is ready for use in ATC. I'm just back from a tour
of EuroControl, Europe's only multinational ATC. Our
guide opened up the back of a controller's console so
we could see the equipment running the displays, and
when I asked him what their upgrade path was going to
be from the old Compaq Alpha boxes that currently run
the displays, he said that a pilot is now underway and
Linux on x86 is scheduled to be deployed next year.
</p><p>
So, in 2005 Tux will be running the displays of the
controllers responsible for airspace through which 19%
of all European flights pass. That penguin's come a
long way.

Bad Webmaster, Bad, Bad!</h4><p>
I currently use Mozilla on my Linux desktop. My bank
recently informed me that it will be supporting
only Internet Explorer.
Without an effective counterattack against critical
IE-only Web sites, the Linux Desktop and the Mac are
doomed to extinction.

The ESTABLISHED Rule</h4><p>
I enjoyed reading Mick Bauer's &ldquo;Application Proxying
with Zorp, Part I&rdquo; in the March 2004 issue.
In the &ldquo;Firewall Refresher Course&rdquo; section, Mr Bauer
states that in a stateful packet filtering system &ldquo;...firewall rules need address only the initiation
of each allowed transaction.&rdquo; He gives a comparative
example between stateful and non-stateful systems in
Tables 1 and 2.
Although Mr Bauer was referring to stateful packet
filtering systems in general, I'd like to point out
that his explanation is not correct with respect to
the Linux Netfilter package. My understanding of
Netfilter, and the way I've been using it the last two
years, is that a rule is required to permit packets
that are part of an existing session to traverse
the firewall (for example, <tt  >-m state --state
ESTABLISHED</tt>).
This assumes that a default policy of DROP is used.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Terry Montgomery  <br><span class="orgname">President of Central Valley Area Linux Enthusiasts
(<a href="http://cvale.org" target="_self">cvale.org</a>)</span><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mick Bauer's reply:</b></span>
I was generalizing. The point was to explain how stateful packet
filtering differs from non-stateful filtering, not to explain how to
configure Netfilter/iptables. Given the complexity of Zorp, the real
topic of that article, I didn't want to spend more time than I had
to on Netfilter basics.
Anyhow, you're correct in pointing out that for the stateful magic
to work in actual Netfilter/iptables practice, you need a single
<tt  >-m
state --state ESTABLISHED</tt> rule at the start of each of your chains.

Internet Safety?</h4><p>
I am enjoying my second year as a subscriber to
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC Magazine</em></span> had a really good issue
this month concerning identity theft, spyware and
viruses. This started me thinking. How does Linux
combat these threats? Is it a concern within the Linux
community? How does Linux stack up in this arena?

All of these problems are commonly spread through
forged e-mail, and you can fight forged e-mail with
SPF (page 50). If you don't run your own mail server,
ask your ISP to use SPF to protect you.  &mdash;Ed.

Erratum</h4><p></p><p>
Regarding &ldquo;Manipulating OpenOffice.org Documents with Ruby&rdquo;,
<i  >LJ</i>, March 2004&mdash;it's come to my attention that I incorrectly
attributed REXML, the Ruby XML library, to Sean
Chittenden. The actual author of that library is
Sean Russell.  &mdash;James Britt
