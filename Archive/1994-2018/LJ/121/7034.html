When an upgrade works, you get a few more features or better
performance. When an upgrade fails, you're in for a weekend of pain.
Now, here's how to back off to the old version and keep the system up.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x152c348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
How many times have you installed a great new piece of software only to find
you really didn't want to install it after all? To make matters worse,
when you installed this software, you had to upgrade several other
software packages and install additional ones from scratch. To put things
back the way they were, you had to locate earlier versions of the
upgraded packages from a multitude of sources, downgrade to these versions
and remove any newly installed packages. Of course, if you did not keep
a good record of what packages actually were changed and what
their previous versions were, things got even worse.
Wouldn't it be great if you instead could push one button or run a
single command and roll back this upgrade?
</p><p>
In some environments the ability to roll back an upgrade
quickly is not only desirable, it is a requirement. For instance, when upgrading
a telecommunications company's equipment, software and hardware vendors
are required to upgrade equipment in a limited time frame,
known as a maintenance window. In this same maintenance window, they
also must be able to back out any changes made by the upgrade. Failure
to back out an upgrade within the maintenance window results in
strict financial penalties.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x152c4a8"></a>
Rolling Back an Upgrade the Hard Way</h2></div></div><p>
As desirable as an automated rollback of RPMs is,
RPM has not supported this option until recently. To be fair, RPM has supported
downgrading a set of packages. For instance, if you upgraded some RPM
<span   class="emphasis"><em>foo-1-1</em></span> to the version <span   class="emphasis"><em>foo-1-2</em></span>, you could use
the --oldpackage switch with the <b  >rpm</b> command to
downgrade to a previous version; like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -Uvh --oldpackage foo-1-1.i386.rpm
Preparing...                ################# [100%]
Upgrading...
   1:foo                    ################# [100%]
</pre>
</p><p>
If the upgrade to <span   class="emphasis"><em>foo-1-2</em></span> did not require
you to upgrade or install any additional RPMs, the --oldpackage
switch worked fine. All you had to do was find the original
<span   class="emphasis"><em>foo-1-1</em></span> RPM, and you were home free. If, on the
other hand, you did need to install or upgrade other RPMs on which
<span   class="emphasis"><em>foo-1-2</em></span> depended, you then had to search for
those RPMs in various locations&mdash;on your install media, on your
distribution's errata site, in various RPM repositories or on various
project Web sites.
</p><p>
Once you had hunted down all the dependent RPMs, you would need
to downgrade all the ones you had upgraded and erase
the fresh ones you had installed. If, instead, you reversed this order
and erased the fresh RPMs you had installed before you downgraded the
RPMs that had been upgraded, you were greeted with errors from
RPM complaining that these packages were required by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>foo-1-2</em></span>.
In short, the old way of rolling back a set of RPMs was painful and
fraught with error.

Transactional Rollbacks to the Rescue</h2></div></div><p>
Early in 2002, Jeff Johnson, the current maintainer of RPM, began to
remedy this rollback problem when he included the transactional rollback
feature into the 4.0.3 release of RPM. This feature brought with it
the promise of an automated downgrade of a set of RPMs. Like many new
features, it was rough around the edges and completely undocumented,
except for a few e-mails on the RPM mailing list (rpm-list@redhat.com).
Over the past year and a half, transactional rollbacks have
matured steadily. In the current RPM 4.2 release, which comes with
Red Hat 9, transactional rollbacks are quite usable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x152ca28"></a>
How RPM Transactional Rollbacks Work</h2></div></div><p>
Under the hood, RPM treats any set of RPMs it installs as
a discrete transaction. This is true when installing one RPM by itself
(a transaction of one RPM) or several RPMs simultaneously. Each of
these transactions is given a unique transaction ID (TID). As each
RPM is installed or upgraded, its entry in the RPM database is marked
with the TID of the transaction within which it was installed.
This allows RPM to track within which transaction each RPM was installed
or upgraded.
</p><p>
To roll back an RPM transaction set, RPM must have access to the
set of RPMs that were on the system at the time the transaction
occurred. It solves this problem by repackaging each RPM before it
is erased and storing these repackaged packages in the repackage
directory (by default, /var/spool/repackage).
Repackaged packages contain all the files owned by the RPM as they existed on the system at the
time of erasure, the header of the old RPM and all the scriptlets that came with the old RPM.
</p><p>
You may be wondering how this design helps with upgrades. After all, if you upgrade
an RPM you're not erasing it. You are erasing it, though, because upgrading an RPM
has two parts: the new package is installed, and the old package is erased.
This means every time you upgrade a set of packages, RPM
first repackages all packages being updated, then installs all
the new packages and, finally, erases all the old packages.
When RPM repackages the old packages, it also marks the repackaged
packages with the TID of the running transaction. The end result
is you don't have to scour the Net, media or backups for the RPMs
you updated. Because the repackaged packages contain the files that
were currently on your system at the time of the upgrade,
the need to restore configuration files from backup is eliminated.
As a side effect, the md5 checksums of the files in a
repackaged package are likely to be wrong, because RPM does not
recalculate each checksum when creating the repackaged package.
This is not a problem for RPM when it rolls back transactions,
but you need to use the --nodigest option
to manipulate repackaged packages directly.
</p><p>
Once the repackage directory is populated, RPM requires only a rollback
target (the date to which it is rolling back) to perform the rollback.
RPM then determines by TID which transactions have been applied to
your system since the rollback target date. Next RPM takes this set
of transactions, sorts them in the order of most recent to least recent
and does the following for each one:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Finds all the repackaged packages that are marked with this
TID.
</p></li><li><p>
Finds all the currently installed packages that are marked with
this TID but do not have corresponding repackaged packages.
</p></li><li><p>
Builds a rollback transaction. Repackaged packages are added
to this transaction as install elements, and installed packages
that have no corresponding repackaged package are added as
erase elements.
</p></li><li><p>
Runs the newly built rollback transaction.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
By repeating these actions for each transaction from the most recent
one to the one nearest or equal to the target date, RPM walks through
all transactions that have occurred since the rollback goal
and undoes them.

How to Use RPM Transactional Rollbacks</h2></div></div><p>
You may be thinking this process is complicated, but using transactional
rollbacks actually is rather easy. As a simple example, let's install
a single RPM and roll it back. The most crucial point you have to
remember is that whenever you do an upgrade or simple erase, you must
tell RPM to repackage the old package before it is erased. To do this,
use the --repackage option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -Uvh --repackage foo-1-2.noarch.rpm
Preparing...   ############################# [100%]
Repackaging...
   1:foo        ############################# [100%]
Upgrading...
   1:foo        ############################# [100%]
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x152d160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Using this option, RPM first repackaged the old package and then upgraded the
new one. On an erase, you also need to use the --repackage
option, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -e --repackage foo
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x152d2c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
RPM does not show any output from an erase, but
if you look in the repackage directory after an erase,
a repackaged package is there.
</p><p>
To roll back this RPM transaction, use the --rollback
option followed by the rollback target. The rollback target can be an
actual date or something like one hour ago (the date specifier
allows the same date formats as the cvs(1) command's -D option). So, if
an hour after upgrading foo, you decide you don't want it, you
could type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# rpm -Uvh --rollback '2 hours ago'
Rollback packages (+1/-1) to
Thu Jul 31 23:26:52 2003 (0x3f29ddfc):
Preparing...  ########################### 100%]
   1:foo       ########################### [ 33%]
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x152d478"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The output <tt  >Rollback packages (+1/-1)</tt> shows that RPM is going
to add one package, the previous version, and erase one package, the
currently installed version.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x152d5d8"></a>
How to Set Up a System for Rollbacks</h2></div></div><p>
Transactional rollbacks are only as good as your local repackaged
packages repository. One quick way of making them fail is to upgrade or
erase something without using the --repackage option. From my
experience, it is pretty easy to forget to use this option. Therefore,
if you are going to use transactional rollbacks, you want to
configure RPM to repackage all erasures automatically. Do this by
setting the <tt  >%_repackage_all_erasures</tt> macro to 1
in your /etc/rpm/macros file. If the file does not exist
simply create it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
%_repackage_all_erasures 1
</pre>
</p><p>
By default, RPM does not roll back a newly installed package; that is, it
does
not erase packages that were not on the system at the time of your upgrade.
You probably don't want this to be the default behavior, so you need
to tell RPM to allow for this. To do this, set the macro
%_unsafe_rollbacks to the date beyond which you do not
want to allow an RPM to be completely erased on a rollback. A good
value for this is some time after your system's initial install.
This date should be in seconds since epoch. To convert a date to
seconds since epoch, use the date command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
date --date="8/1/2003" +%s
1059710400
</pre>
</p><p>
If you wanted to tell RPM not to remove packages
completely that were installed on or before 8/1/2003 (the date in the above
example), you would add the following to the /etc/rpm/macros
file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
%_unsafe_rollbacks 1059710400
</pre>
</p><p>
The only other thing you may want to configure is where RPM puts the
repackaged packages. One reason for doing this is to ensure they
are placed in a partition that has ample space. To change the repackage
directory, set the %_repackage_dir macro to the
directory where you wish to store the repackaged packages:

<pre     class="programlisting">
%_repackage_dir /my_rp_repository
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you have a system that automatically repackages all erasures (so you or
someone else does not forget),
erases newly installed packages on a rollback (but won't erase
your whole system) and
places the repackaged packages where you want to store them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x152d9f8"></a>
Using up2date to Roll Back RPM Transactions</h2></div></div><p>
In Red Hat 9, up2date supports rollbacks using RPM's transactional
rollback mechanism. Configuring it to support transactional rollbacks
is as simple as running <tt  >up2date-config</tt>, clicking the
Retrieval/Installation tab and then clicking the
Enable RPM rollbacks check box (see Figure 1).
You have to configure RPM itself as described
in the previous section.
When you upgrade your system using up2date, once you have configured both
RPM and up2date, RPM
creates the repackaged packages of RPMs you are updating
before it upgrades those packages.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7034f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Enabling RPM Rollbacks in up2date
</p></div></div><p>
To list the different known rollback targets, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
up2date --list-rollbacks
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x1524650"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You should receive a listing like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# up2date --list-rollbacks
install time: Sun Jul 27 20:49:55 2003   tid:1059353395
	        [-] goo-1.0-1.0:

install time: Tue Jul 29 20:44:25 2003   tid:1059525865
	        [-] foo-1-2:
</pre>
</p><p>
This command is handy even if you are not
actually using up2date, because the rpm command does not
provide a way of displaying such information.
</p><p>
To undo a transaction, use the --undo option, which
undoes the last transaction that was installed. Simply type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# up2date --undo
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x15248b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you want to roll back multiple transactions, run this command
multiple times. The ability to roll back from the GUI is not
supported.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x15249c0"></a>
Auto-Rollback Patch</h2></div></div><p>
RPM normally delivers packages using a best effort strategy, meaning
if one or more RPMs fails to install, the remaining RPMs
in the transaction still are installed. This
is a desirable behavior in some environments, but in others it would be much better
if, instead, RPM automatically rolled back the failed transaction. Because
I work in such an environment (telecommunications), I wrote a patch
called the auto-rollback patch. This patch allows you to configure
RPM such that if a transaction fails, RPM automatically rolls back
the failed transaction. It does leave behind the failed
RPM if it failed in its %post scriptlet; hopefully that soon will be fixed
(patches anyone?).
</p><p>
If you would like to use this feature, you can download the patch (or
RPMs that have the patch applied) from <a href="http://lee.k12.nc.us/~joden/misc/patches/rpm" target="_self">lee.k12.nc.us/~joden/misc/patches/rpm</a>.
Once you have a version of RPM installed with the auto-rollback patch,
you need to configure RPM to use the auto-rollback feature. To
do so, edit /etc/rpm/macros and add the following
macro definition:

<pre     class="programlisting">
%_rollback_transaction_on_failure 1
</pre>
</p><p>
After doing this, the next time you install/upgrade a set of RPMs and one
fails to install, RPM automatically rolls back the failed transaction,
except for the failing one if it failed in the %post scriptlet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1434580.0x1524c28"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
RPM transactional rollbacks provide an efficient way of undoing
RPM upgrades. They also provide a solid building block upon which
system update programs (such as up2date, yum and apt-get) can provide
automated rollback functionality. However, transactional rollbacks are
not for everyone. To quote Jeff Johnson, &ldquo;the --rollback option...requires absolutely perfect system administration and is
mostly mechanism, not policy.&rdquo; Transactional rollbacks are an
all-or-nothing affair. Care must be taken to ensure that
all erasures are repackaged, as RPM's ability to roll back transactions
is only as good as its source of repackaged packages.
The administrator must ensure that extra space is allocated
for the storage of the repackaged packages. Finally,
RPM's transactional rollback feature is a work-in-progress.
That said, RPM transactional rollbacks have come a long way from their
beginnings. If you want to ensure that RPM updates to
a system can be undone quickly, they may be exactly what the doctor ordered.
