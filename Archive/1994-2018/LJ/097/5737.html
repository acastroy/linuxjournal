    Concentrating on user privileges to appease the security
    paranoid.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca1580.0xd994a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>A common topic of discussion nowadays is
security, and for good reason. Security is becoming more important
as the world becomes further networked. Like all good systems,
Linux is evolving in order to address increasingly important
security concerns.</p><p>One aspect of security is user privileges. UNIX-style user
privileges come in two varieties, user and root. Regular users are
absolutely powerless; they cannot modify any processes or files but
their own. Access to hardware and most network specifications also
are denied. Root, on the other hand, can do anything from modifying
all processes and files to having unrestricted network and hardware
access. In some cases root can even physically damage
hardware.</p><p>Sometimes a middle ground is desired. A utility needs special
privileges to perform its function, but unquestionable god-like
root access is overkill. The ping utility is setuid root simply so
it can send and receive ICMP messages. The danger lies in the fact
that ping can be exploited before it has dropped its root
privileges, giving the attacker root access to your server.</p><p>Fortunately, such a middle ground now exists, and it's called
POSIX capabilities. Capabilities divide system access into logical
groups that may be individually granted to, or removed from,
different processes. Capabilities allow system administrators to
fine-tune what a process is allowed to do, which may help them
significantly reduce security risks to their system. The best part
is that your system already supports it. If you're lucky, no
patching should be necessary.</p><p>A list of all the capabilities that your system is, well,
capable of, is available in /usr/include/linux/capability.h,
starting with CAP_CHOWN. They're pretty self-explanatory and well
commented. Capability checks are sprinkled throughout the kernel
source, and grepping for them can make for some fun midnight
reading.</p><p>Each capability is nothing more than a bit in a bitmap. With
32 bits in a capability set, and 28 sets currently defined, there
are currently discussions as to how to expand this number. Some
purists believe that additional capabilities would be too
confusing, while others argue that there should be many more, even
a capability for each system call. Time and Linus will ultimately
decide how this exciting feature develops.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca1580.0xd99768"></a>The Proc Interface</h2></div></div><p>As of kernel 2.4.17, the file /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound
contains a single 32-bit integer that defines the current global
capability set. The global capability set determines what every
process on the system is allowed to do. If a capability is stripped
from the system, it is impossible for any process, even root
processes, to regain them.</p><p>For example, many crackers' rootkits (a set of tools that
cover up their activities and install backdoors into the system)
will load kernel modules that hide illicit processes and files from
the system administrator. To counter this, the administrator could
simply remove the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability from the system as the
last step in the system startup process. This step would prevent
any kernel modules from being loaded or unloaded. Once a capability
has been removed, it cannot be re-added. The system must be
restarted (which means you might have to use the power button if
you've removed the CAP_SYS_BOOT capability) to regain the
full-capability set.</p><p>Okay, I lied. There are two ways to add back a
capability:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>init can re-add capabilities, in theory; there's no
actual implementation to my knowledge. This is to facilitate
capability-aware systems in the event that init needs to change
runlevels.</p></li><li><p>If a process is capable of CAP_SYS_RAWIO, it can
modify kernel memory through /dev/mem. Among other things, it can
modify kernel memory to grant itself whatever access it desires.
Remove CAP_SYS_RAWIO, but be careful: by removing CAP_SYS_RAWIO,
programs such as X most likely will fail to run.</p></li></ol></div><p>Editing cap-bound by hand is kind of tedious. Fortunately for
you, there's a utility called lcap that provides a friendlier
interface to cap-bound. Here's how one would remove CAP_SYS_CHOWN:
<pre     class="programlisting">
lcap CAP_SYS_CHOWN
</pre>


Once done, it becomes impossible to change a file's owner:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chown nobody test.txt
chown: changing ownership of `test.txt':
       Operation not permitted
</pre>


Here's how you would remove all capabilities except CAP_SYS_BOOT,
CAP_SYS_KILL and CAP_SYS_NICE:
<pre     class="programlisting">
lcap -z CAP_SYS_BOOT CAP_SYS_KILL CAP_SYS_NICE
</pre>


One thing to note: modifying cap-bound restricts the capabilities
of future processes only. Okay, not exactly future processes but
any process that calls exec(2) (see the function compute_creds in
the kernel source file fs/exec.c). Currently running processes keep
the capabilities with which they started.
</p><p>Modifying the capabilities of an existing process leads us
into the next section, and here's the catch I spoke about above.
Running lcap with no arguments lists what your system is capable
of. If you see that CAP_SETPCAP is disabled, you need to make a
change to your kernel. It's simple enough to describe here. In the
kernel source tree, edit include/linux/capability.h. You're
changing the lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define CAP_INIT_EFF_SET
to_cap_t(~0 &amp; ~CAP_TO_MASK(CAP_SETPCAP))
#define CAP_INIT_INH_SET  to_cap_t(0)
</pre><p>so that they read:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#define CAP_INIT_EFF_SET  to_cap_t(~0)
#define CAP_INIT_INH_SET  to_cap_t(~0)
</pre>


and then recompile.
</p><p>There's actually a reason that CAP_SETPCAP is disabled by
default: it's deemed a security risk to leave it enabled on a
production system (a patch exists for this condition but has yet to
be applied as of this writing). To be on the safe side, make sure
to remove this capability when you're done playing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca1580.0xd99df0"></a>The System Call Interface</h2></div></div><p>As of this writing, the syscalls capset and capget manipulate
capabilities for a process. There are no guarantees that this
interface won't change. Portable applications are encouraged to use
libcap
(<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.4" target="_self">www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.4</a>)
instead.</p><p>The prototype for capset is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int capset(cap_user_header_t header,
const cap_user_data_t data);
</pre><p>HEADER is a fancy way to say which pid you're operating on:
<pre     class="programlisting">
typedef struct __user_cap_header_struct {
        __u32 version;
        int pid;
} *cap_user_header_t;
</pre>


If pid is -1, you will modify the capabilities of all currently
running processes. Less than -1 and you modify the process group
equal to pid times -1. The semantics are similar to those of
kill(2).
</p><p>The DATA argument allows you to choose which capability sets
you plan to modify. There are three:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typedef struct __user_cap_data_struct {
        __u32 effective;
        __u32 permitted;
        __u32 inheritable;
} *cap_user_data_t;
</pre><p>The permitted set contains all of the capabilities that a
process is ultimately capable of realizing.
</p><p>The effective set is the capabilities a process has elected
to utilize from its permitted set. It's as if you had a huge
arsenal of poetry (permitted set) but chose only to arm yourself
with Allen Ginsberg for the task at hand (effective set).</p><p>The inheritable set defines which capabilities may be passed
on to any programs that replace the current process image via
exec(2). Please note that fork(2) does nothing special with
capabilities. The child simply receives an exact copy of all three
capabilities sets.</p><p>Only capabilities in the permitted set can be added to the
effective or inheritable set. Capabilities cannot be added to the
permitted set of a process unless CAP_SETPCAP is set.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca1580.0xd9a2c0"></a>The Filesystem Interface</h2></div></div><p>Sadly, capabilities still lack filesystem support, limiting
their usefulness to a degree. Someday, the mainstream kernels will
allow you to enable capabilities in a program's inode, obviating
the setuid bit in many system utilities.</p><p>Once fully supported, permitting the ping utility to open raw
sockets could be as simple as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chattr +CAP_NET_RAW /bin/ping
</pre><p>Unfortunately, more pressing kernel issues have delayed work
in this area.
</p><p>If you're so inclined, you can use libcap to hack your
favorite services so that they are capability-aware and drop the
privileges they no longer need at startup. Several patches exist
for xntpd that do just this; some even provide their modified
version as an RPM. Try a Google search if you're interested in a
capability-aware version of some root-level process you find
yourself often shaking a fist at.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>setpcap</b></span> can be used to
modify the capability set of an existing process. For example, if
the PID of a regular user's shell is 4235, here's how you can give
that user's shell the ability to send signals to any
process:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
setpcaps 'cap_kill=ep' 4235
</pre><p>An example use of this would be to allow a friend who is
using your machine to debug a CGI script to kill any Apache
processes that get stuck in infinite loops. You'd run it against
their login shell once and forget about them.
</p><p>Here's an example that utilizes execcap and sucap to run ping
as the user &ldquo;nobody&rdquo;, with only the CAP_NET_RAW capability. Our
target of choice for ping is
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_self">www.yahoo.com</a>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
execcap 'cap_net_raw=ep' /sbin/sucap nobody
nobody /bin/ping www.yahoo.com
</pre><p>This sample isn't terribly useful because you need to be root
to execute it, but it does illustrate what is possible. Despite
some of these shortcomings, system administrators still can take
measures to increase the security of their system. A system without
CAP_SYS_BOOT, CAP_SYS_RAWIO and CAP_SYS_MODULE is extremely
difficult for an intruder to modify. They cannot hack kernel
memory, install new modules or restart the system so that it runs a
backdoored kernel.
</p><p>If your system logs are append-only and your core system
utilities immutable (see chattr(3) for details), removing the
CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability will make it virtually impossible
for intruders to erase their tracks or install compromised
utilities. Traffic sniffers like tcpdump become unusable once
CAP_NET_RAW is removed. Remove CAP_SYS_PTRACE and you've turned off
program debugging. Such a hostile environment is a script kiddy's
worst nightmare, and there is no choice but to disconnect and wait
for the intrusion to be discovered.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xca1580.0xd9a840"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Capabilities can provide sophisticated, fine-grained access
