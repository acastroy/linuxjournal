the rare opportunity of taking some time from Ted Ts'o's tight
schedule to talk about his role with the Linux kernel, IBM and the
Linux community. Ted seems to be everywhere in the Linux
community&mdash;inside the kernel and out. He is currently a senior
technical staff member of the Linux Base Technology Team for IBM's
Linux Technology Center. He also chairs the Technical Board of
Linux International, serves on the Board of Directors for the Free
Standards Group, is a member of the Internet Engineering Task Force
and serves on the Security Area Directorate of the IETF.
Previously, he worked at MIT in Information Systems, where he was
the development team leader for Kerberos. Through it all he's
played a principal role in the development of the Linux
kernel.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5891_bigted.jpg"></div>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> Many Linux enthusiasts
know you for your work on the Linux kernel, but are perhaps less
familiar with your service to Linux International and the Free
Standards Group. Could you talk a little about your respective
capacities with those organizations?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> Well, I chair the
Technical Board of Linux International. Linux International is a
vendor group that got started back in the good old days of Linux
startups&mdash;when Bob Young would personally show up at tradeshows
and help hand out CDs containing the Slackware distribution. So
from the beginning, Linux International had as a strong emphasis
the concept that its members should band together to help &ldquo;grow
the pie&rdquo;.</p><p>The technical board was there to help make sure the
organization stayed connected to its technical roots and later
picked up the responsibility to examine applications to the Linux
International Development Grant Fund, which is still operating
today.</p><p>Very recently, Linux International has begun considering a
new program that will focus on strengthening the various local
Linux Users' Groups and working with them to support people who are
interested in doing various types of &ldquo;Linux Advocacy&rdquo; (i.e.,
pushing Linux to be used in local public schools or in the
corporate infrastructure). This is an idea that I've been
discussing with Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall, and I think it's a great
initiative. I hope it works out well.</p><p>As for the Free Standards Group, I currently serve on the
Board of Directors for the FSG. The FSG provides a legal and
financial home for the Linux Standards Base (LSB) and the Linux
Internationalization (Li18nux) efforts. I was involved with the LSB
from almost the very beginning because I believe in providing a
stable environment so that members of the community can release
binary distributions of programs that will run on any Linux system
of the same architecture, regardless of the distribution that the
user chose to use.</p><p>I was student systems programmer in MIT Project Athena during
the height of the UNIX wars and saw firsthand how incompatibilities
between the various UNIXes allowed Microsoft to dominate the
desktop. So as a result, I've always thought that the LSB is
incredibly important for the Linux community.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> How do you feel about the
recent progress of LSB (the release of LSB 1.1), and what do you
feel is the future for LSB&mdash;will it be something that evolves into
an ubiqitous standard? What might be some of the advantages of LSB
for developers who distribute software in source-code form?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> Progress on the LSB
front has been slow but steady. LSB 1.1 isn't perfect, but it's at
the stage where it should be possible for both distributions and
independent software vendors to start implementing against it. We
expect to start seeing LSB-compliant distributions and application
programs within a year.</p><p>The LSB standard is working to make it possible for
third-party application programs to be installed and run across
multiple distributions. Initially, the majority of packages on a
Linux system will still be provided by the distribution and will
not be LSB-compliant packages.</p><p>Hopefully, as the distributions start seeing the advantages
of the LSB, and as demand increases for more commonality between
the various distributions, the LSB will help encourage
distributions to start converging gradually, as new features are
added. This will act to benefit all developers, even those who
distribute code in source form already.</p><p>ABI-compatibility, while most important to people or
companies that distribute sources in binary form, is also important
to people who are using exclusively open-source software. For
example, some library maintainers don't bother to change symbol
names or even in some cases, library version numbers, when they
make incompatible library changes. This can cause all sorts of
headaches if two application programs installed on the same system
need to reference different libraries. An extreme example of
ABI-instability can be found in libgal (the GNOME Applications
Library), which has had 19 different, incompatible ABI changes in
about as many months. Even if source is available, this kind of
ABI-instability is extremely inconvenient.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> What areas will FSG look
at standardizing next?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> Well, there are two
groups that have approached the FSG. One is interested in
standardizing some kind of high-level printing libraries interface.
Another group is interested in standardizing library interfaces for
clusters. In general, the FSG doesn't try to find new technologies
to standardize; instead it allows people who are interested in
forming a workgroup to work on some standard to do so. The FSG
Board simply insists that the process is open and, to the extent
possible, that all interested parties are at the table while the
standard is being developed.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> Could you briefly
describe your work at IBM?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> Well, I'm continuing to
work on the kernel, especially the ext2/ext3 filesystem work. I've
also been consulting with some of the other teams at the Linux
Technology Center, helping them with design issues and helping them
make their contributions be more easily accepted into the mainline
Linux kernel.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> What would you consider
to be some of the most significant developments of the 2.5 series
kernel?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> It's early in the 2.5
development series, so it's really hard to say right now. I'd say
that scalability to larger machines and associated sub-goals, such
as reducing or removing the need for the global &ldquo;big kernel lock&rdquo;
is certainly going to be one of the more significant efforts in the
2.5 series. The introduction of the O(1) scheduler is also quite
significant. Work to continue improving the virtual memory
subsystem and the I/O subsystem also is ongoing and ultimately very
important. With the exception of a few new features, such as better
ACPI support and asynchronous I/O support, I suspect most of the
improvements in the 2.5 kernel will be performance-related.</p><p>That being said, as Linus has said&mdash;and I very much agree&mdash;a
lot of the exciting new work that is happening in the Linux
community isn't necessarily happening in the kernel, but in user
land. For example, who would have thought that five years ago,
Linux would have not one, but <span   class="emphasis"><em>two</em></span> graphical
desktop environment systems under development?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> You are the author of
/dev/random. How will the Linux kernel hackers approach
crypto-enabling technology in the kernel? Cautiously, or are the
developers jumping in with both feet now that US export
restrictions are looser?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> Well, Peter Anvin did
some wonderful work laying the legal groundwork (thanks must also
go to Transmeta for paying the legal bills) so that cryptographic
software could be distributed from the kernel.org FTP distribution
network. There are certainly some people who are still a bit
cautious. That's understandable since many developers have lived
behind the Crypto Iron Curtain for so long that they're still
afraid the US government might change its mind and suddenly try to
regulate cryptography again. At this point though, my belief is
that the crypto genie is so far out of the bottle that this sort of
nightmare scenario is very unlikely.</p><p>I think that it's only a matter of time before developers
start adding more cryptography into the kernel. On the other hand,
there's a lot of cryptographic solutions where the right place to
put things really is outside of the kernel.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> With all the many
demanding activities with which you are involved, how do you stay
organized and find sufficient time to devote to each
activity?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> It's hard. One of the
disappointing things about being involved with doing more
organizational tasks, such as serving on the board of the FSG and
working on the LSB, is that it means I have less time to do real
kernel-level programming. But, someone has to do it, and I happen
to be somewhat good at it, so....</p><p>That being said, I am hoping that I'll be adjusting my
workload so that I will have more of a chance to do some real
programming than I have in the past year or two.</p><p>One of the other ways that I try to find time is to pass off
projects to other people. For example, I was one of the original
instigators of bringing Pluggable Authentication Modules
architecture to Linux. At the time, I was working at MIT, and I
visited Sun Microsystems to discuss some issues relating to
Kerberos. Near the close of the meeting, the Sun engineers
introduced me to this thing called PAM, and I immediately thought
that this was a really great idea, and gee, wouldn't it be great if
Linux could have it too. So I started suggesting that this would be
a good thing to do, and next thing I knew, Andrew Morgan had
stepped forward and ran with it. The funny thing about this whole
story is that even though the engineers had been working on PAM for
at least a year or two before they introduced it to me, the
Linux-PAM Project had an initial implementation working, which was
shipping in commercial distributions before Sun was able to ship a
version of Solaris that had PAM support. That's what's so great
about the open-source model.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> How is IBM contributing
to the development of open-source software?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> Well, IBM started the
Linux Technology Center with some 250 or so engineers, spread out
across some 16 cities and six countries, all working on open-source
software. And we have a mandate to try to get our changes accepted
into the mainline versions of the kernel or whatever open-source
project we might be working on. So we're trying very hard to work
as members of the Linux and OSS community. Of course, the sort of
OSS enhancements we choose to work on are also those that are
important to IBM's customers, but that's true at all Linux
companies. The wonderful thing is that in most cases, the interests
of the global Linux community and the interests of IBM's and other
Linux companies' customers are the same.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> What pieces of the kernel
are you working on right now?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> Right now, I've been
mainly focused on the ext2/ext3 filesystem. I'd like to work on
reworking the tty layer, but there are only so many hours in a
week. Maybe in a month or two, I'll have some time to actually try
tackling that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> How long have you been
interested in amateur radio and what got you interested?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> I've had an amateur
radio license since 1997. I got involved because I knew a lot of
people at MIT who were using the MIT UHF Repeater to communicate
and that sucked me in.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> What has been your role
in developing Linux POSIX capabilities, and what is your position
on the current number of 28? Do you think this should be
maintained, or expanded?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> Like PAM, Linux POSIX
capabilities is one of those things that I tried pushing, but with
less success. I still think that something like POSIX capabilities
is important, but I'm not so sure anymore that Posix capabilities
is the right way to go about solving the problem. Most system
administrators have trouble dealing with 12 bits of UNIX permission
bits per file. Adding another 3 &times; 28 = 84 capability bits
that must be configured correctly or the executable will either
stop working or be insecure, is a nightmare.</p><p>A simpler system where programs are still setuid root, but
then permanently drop all of the capabilities they won't need, is
certainly a lot less flexible than the full POSIX-capabilities
model, but I think it is so much easier to administer that this
makes it far more important than other considerations.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> Have you tried SELinux?
If so what do you think?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> No, I haven't had time
to actively install and play with SELinux. I think it's great that
the NSA has been working on it, though.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> Do you see a conflict yet
between optimizing Linux for throughput on mid-range or large
servers and going for small size and latency on embedded-class
systems?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> Well, I think it's a
challenge to come up with algorithms that work well on both
mid-range and large servers, yet are also well adapted to typical
desktop machines. But, I think it's doable. In some cases, perhaps
the end result won't look like what has traditionally been done to
support large-scale servers or small embedded-class sytems. But
that's what makes working on the Linux kernel so neat! We're not
always implementing things the traditional way, but trying to find
new ways of skinning the proverbial cat.</p><p>So no, I don't think there will necessarily be a conflict
between optimizing Linux both for large servers and small servers.
I do believe that the primary tuning target will continue to be the
typical desktop machine, since that's what most developers have and
can afford. However, the typical desktop (as well as the typical
embedded system) has been gradually becoming more and more
powerful, and over time, the range of systems where Linux will have
excellent performance will continue to grow with each new major
version of Linux.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> Besides the Rubini and
Corbet book, how would you recommend that people who want to
contribute learn about the kernel, both for writing drivers for 2.4
and wild and woolly features for 2.5?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> The
<a href="http://www.kernelnewbies.org" target="_self">www.kernelnewbies.org</a>
site is definitely one of the best places to start. Beyond that,
the best way to learn about the kernel is to jump in and start
playing with it! Come on in! The water's fine!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span> Anything you'd like to
add?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Ted</b></span> Only that I consider
myself incredibly lucky. Ten years ago, Linux was just a hobby;
something that I did for fun. Now it's become a major force in the
computer industry, so I can work full-time on something that I once
did just because I loved doing it. That's neat. That's really
neat.</p></div></div>
