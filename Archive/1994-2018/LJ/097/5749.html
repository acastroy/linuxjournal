    Programming in kernel space has always been left to the
    gurus. Few people have the courage, knowledge and patience
    to work in the realm of interrupts, devices and the always
    painful kernel panic.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12df580.0x13d7710"></a></h2></div></div><p>When you write programs in user space,
the worst thing that can happen to your program is a core dump.
Your program did something very wrong, so the operating system
decided to give you all of its memory and state information back to
you in the form of a core file. Core files can then be used to
debug your program and fix the problem.</p><p>When you program in the kernel, there is no operating system
to step in and safely stop your code from running and tell you that
you have a problem. The Linux kernel is pretty nice to its own
code. Sometimes it can survive a panic, if you are doing something
wrong that is relatively benign (these panics are typically called
oopses). But, there is nothing to stop your code from overwriting
or accessing memory locations from anywhere in the kernel's address
space. Also, if your module hangs, the kernel hangs (technically,
your current kernel thread hangs, but the result is usually the
same).</p><p>These problems may sound benign to the na&iuml;ve, but they
are serious issues. If the kernel panics, you rarely know exactly
what caused the panic. The typical solution is to put printks
everywhere and hope that you stumble across the problem before the
messages are lost to the reboot. All of this is assuming that you
do not corrupt your filesystem. I have lost an entire filesystem
before due to a poorly timed panic (and due to the fact that a
badly initialized pointer was overwriting some of ext2's internal
structures).</p><p>The first thing you learn when kernel programming is to keep
all your code on NFS. Files remain safe on another machine. But,
that does not save you the time of having e2fsck run every time you
panic. Plus, you still can lose your filesystem, even if your
source code is safe on another machine.</p><p>So, with all of these issues, it is not surprising how few
have entered the realm of kernel programming. Now, all that can
change.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12df580.0x13d7978"></a>Virtual Machines and UML</h2></div></div><p>Back in the mainframe days, when timesharing machines were
the norm, the idea of a virtual machine was born. A virtual machine
is an encapsulated computer completely at your disposal. A program
on a virtual machine has no real access to the physical hardware.
All hardware access is controlled by the machine or
emulator.</p><p>VMware
(<a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_self">www.vmware.com</a>) has a
very powerful virtual machine that allows you to run any x86-based
operating system under Windows NT, 2000, XP or Linux. SoftPC (an
8086 emulator allowing you to run Windows and DOS programs) has
been available on Motorola 68k-based computers (i.e., the
Macintosh) since 1988.</p><p>True virtual machines are sometimes too expensive for the
learner's budget. (VMware Workstation for Linux costs $299 US from
their web site.) Thankfully, there is now a free alternative for
those only wanting to run Linux: User-Mode Linux (UML).</p><p>User-Mode Linux
(<a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net" target="_self">user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net</a>)
is not a complete virtual machine. It does not emulate different
hardware or give you the ability to run other operating systems.
But, it <span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> allow you to run a kernel in user
space. This gives you several benefits when it comes to
development: the host filesystem is safe from corruption, the
virtual filesystem is undoable (which makes it safe from
corruption), you can run multiple machines on one machine (this is
useful for testing intermachine communication, i.e., network
messages, without having to use multiple machines) and it is very
easy to run the kernel in a debugger.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12df580.0x13d7c90"></a>Setting up UML</h2></div></div><p>Running UML is easy. You can download one of the binary
packages (kernel binaries, plus a couple of tools), or you can
download the kernel patch. You also need to download a filesystem.
I'd recommend playing with the binaries first, then building a
custom kernel to suit your needs. The HOWTO covers all of these
topics and more.</p><p>One useful benefit of UML is Copy-on-Write files. These files
allow you to modify a virtual filesystem, without modifying the
base filesystem. All writes or modifications to a filesystem are
stored in these files, typically ending with the extension
.cow.</p><p>So, when you are working, and you panic the filesystem, all
you do is remove the .cow file (which will be recreated), and your
corrupted filesystem is restored to its pristine version. (There
are also tools to incorporate the changes in a .cow file back into
the original filesystem, if you want to keep your changes.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12df580.0x13d7e48"></a>Debugging Modules</h2></div></div><p>Once you have UML up and running, it's time to play. I've
written a very simple kernel module for testing. It uses four
devices, /dev/gentest[0-3]. The module treats each device a little
differently. Device 1 is a sink (just like /dev/null). Device 2
stores a string for later retrieval. You can read the status of the
module from device 3, and device 0 could be any of the other three
devices, depending on how it is configured. (You can change the
configuration with ioctl calls.) The kernel module is available
from

Let's say when someone
opens device 4 (<b  >cat /dev/gentest4</b>), the module
hangs in a nasty loop: <b  >for(;;) i++;</b> (see Listing
1). Deadlocks or hangs are common errors when writing programs.
They are sometimes hard to find. Typically programmers just use
printks to locate the errors: <b  >printk("Got
here!\n");</b>. This type of debugging works, but you still
hang the system several times before you find the problem. With
constant fscks, it can get ugly. But, with UML, you just add in the
printks and reboot to a fresh filesystem every time to test
it.</p><p><a href="5749l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Test Bug</a></p><p>UML will help us find that bug with printks, but it is
nothing that would have caused us more than a few reboots. Now
let's make our first really nasty bug. Let's say that when someone
reads from device 5 (i.e., <b  >cat /dev/gentest5</b>);
the module starts to overwrite all memory: <b  >memset(0, 0,
0xffffffff);</b> (see Listing 2). Overwriting memory is a
common error in C programs. In the kernel it is especially nasty
and can sometimes cause an instant reboot, keeping you from seeing
any printks that are generated. These bugs can still be isolated
with printk, but it is a very time-consuming process.</p><p><a href="5749l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. A Really Nasty
Bug</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12df580.0x13d8420"></a>Debugging with GDB</h2></div></div><p>From what I've covered so far, UML is a great debugging tool.
You can use it to keep your filesystem safe when debugging modules.
But there's something more: GDB.</p><p>As most experienced kernel programmers know, there is already
a way to debug a kernel using GDB and the serial line. But, in my
experience, it really doesn't work very well. The GDB shim in the
kernel sometimes hangs, and you need two machines to make it work.
I have successfully debugged kernels running in VMware on one
machine by redirecting the virtual machine's serial port to a file,
but it was slow going, since the kernel portion of the GDB code
could still sometimes hang.</p><p>UML makes all that a thing of the past. With UML, you can run
the entire virtual machine under GDB, attach to a kernel while it's
running, or even after a panic. The easiest way to run UML under
GDB is to add the command-line flag <b  >debug</b> to
your runline. UML will then spawn GDB in an xterm for you and stop
the kernel. For most purposes, just type <b  >c</b> to
allow the kernel to continue booting up (see Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5749f1.large.jpg"><img src="5749f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Running UML under GDB
</p></div></div><p>To debug the module, you first have to load the module, then
tell GDB where the symbol file is, then set any breakpoints you
need.</p><p>So, first things first, load the module. Included in the
source code is a simple shell script called loadModule that loads
the module and creates the devices if they do not already
exist.</p><p>Once the module is loaded, press Ctrl-C inside the GDB window
to pause the kernel, and look at the module_list pointer. The last
module loaded should be at the head of the list. You can use a
simple printf command to get the address of the module. You'll need
it when loading the symbol file (see Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5749f2.large.jpg"><img src="5749f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Module List
</p></div></div><p>Now, load the symbols file with the command
<b  >add-symbol-file MODULE_PATH ADDRESS</b>. The
filename used is the filename on the host system,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> on the virtual machine. After answering
&ldquo;y&rdquo; to an &ldquo;Are you sure you know what you're doing?&rdquo; question,
the symbol file is loaded. You can check that it has been loaded
correctly by re-examining the module_list pointer again. Notice
that now the init and cleanup pointers have the appropriate
function names associated with their addresses (see Figure
3).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5749f3.large.jpg"><img src="5749f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Loading the Symbol File
</p></div></div><p>Now that the module is loaded, you can set any breakpoints
you want. I'll set a breakpoint at open and then try to cat one of
the devices (see Figure 4).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5749f4.large.jpg"><img src="5749f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Setting Breakpoints
</p></div></div><p>Now, let's run our two tests and see how hard the bugs are to
find when using GDB. On the first test, the system still hangs.
But, now we can press Ctrl-C in the debugger and see where it is
hung.</p><p>In the hang test (see Figure 5) it is obvious that the
current stopping point is inside the for loop. If we really want to
have fun, we can print out the value of i to see what it
contains.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5749f5.large.jpg"><img src="5749f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Hang Test
</p></div></div><p>Now, the memory overwrite is a bit more difficult. Not
because it is a panic, but because I used memset.
<span   class="bold"><b>memset</b></span>, in the GNU libc, ends up
inserting inline assembly into your code, so it looks like your bug
is in string.h, instead of your module. But, it still lets you know
which function the error occurred in, and you still know it is
inside of a memset (see Figure 6).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="5749f6.large.jpg"><img src="5749f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Memory Overwrite
</p></div></div><p>Also, you still can examine any local variables in the
current function (gRead) or any global variables to help you find
the problem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12df580.0x17d1748"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>While UML might not let you debug a device driver (since UML
does not have access to the physical hardware on the machine), it
is an invaluable aid in debugging kernel modules. It allows you to
write and debug kernel modules as easily as other C programs,
without fear of panics, deadlocks and data loss. It is a useful
addition to any kernel hacker's toolbelt.</p><p><a href="5749s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
