    And, on how new standards are often compatible with free and
    open-source licensing.

become a Tower of Babel. Our freedom to speak what we wish depends
fundamentally on our agreement to speak the same languages.
Standards are the common linguistic foundation on which we build
our diverse world. To be useful for software, a standard must be
available worldwide and be free of encumbrances that prevent its
widespread adoption.</p><p>Consider the implications for the owner of intellectual
property (e.g., the owner of a patent or copyright) who wishes to
promote that property as the basis for an industry standard. Or
consider the interests of a developer of industry standard software
who learns that another person's intellectual property blocks the
implementation of the standard. Is private intellectual property
compatible with industry standards in an open-source world?</p><p>This is not an academic question. Standards organizations
everywhere are trying to decide how to incorporate private
intellectual property into the framework of the Free Software
Foundation guidelines and the Open Source Definition, under which
source code must be published and the software must be available
for free copying, modification and distribution.</p><p>Patents pose the greatest threat to standards and their
implementation in open-source software. Any person who owns a
patent containing claims that are essential to the implementation
of a standard can prevent you from making, using or selling
products that implement that standard.</p><p>I won't bother defining the phrase &ldquo;essential claims&rdquo; here,
but consider the effect if the only technically feasible or
economically practical way to implement a standard requires the use
of patented technology. Since the law generally doesn't mandate
compulsory licensing of patents and doesn't define &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;
royalties, the standard may be effectively off-limits for those who
can't afford to pay or to design around the blocking
technology.</p><p>Many people complained publicly when the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) tentatively proposed a patent policy that would
allow adoption of web standards based on patented technology for
which reasonable and nondiscriminatory (RAND) royalties could be
charged. The Free and Open Source communities argued that such
royalties&mdash;even if they are &ldquo;nondiscriminatory&rdquo;, as between rich
and poor&mdash;are not compatible with software that is distributed with
source code under licenses that permit free copying, modification
and distribution. As a result of that public outcry, the W3C patent
policy currently is being redrafted. By the time this article
appears, a new draft patent policy should be available for public
comment at
<a href="http://www.w3c.org" target="_self">www.w3c.org</a>.</p><p>One solution to this patent problem for standards is to
require that owners of intellectual property license their patents,
royalty free, for use in implementing industry standards. Members
of organizations such as W3C agree to do just that (under certain
conditions that they describe on their web site). Not all standards
organizations have such policies. Implementers of standards should
verify, by reviewing the patent policies of the organizations that
promulgated the standards, that there are no known patent obstacles
to the implementation of those standards.</p><p>Even when patents are licensed for implementation of the
standard, the patent license may not be compatible with the license
under which the resulting software will be distributed. For
example, some patent license provisions typically say that the
patent is licensed only for implementation of the specific standard
(a &ldquo;field of use&rdquo; restriction).</p><p>The GPL is not compatible with patent licenses that are
restricted as to field of use. GPL software must be free so that
anyone can create derived works, including derived works that are
used for other purposes. (Hackers say that the code must be
available for &ldquo;forking&rdquo; and for &ldquo;reuse&rdquo; in other applications.)
Patent licenses with field-of-use restrictions run afoul of section
7 of the GPL, which reads in part: &ldquo;[If] a patent license would
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the
only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&rdquo;</p><p>Because business motives of patent licensors differ, you will
need to read the patent licenses, and the policies of the standards
organizations, to make sure that the license you receive to a
patent is compatible with your open-source software. Seek out
standards organizations like W3C and the Embedded Linux Consortium
that invite input from the Open Source community on their patent
policies and procedures.</p><p>Be aware that &ldquo;industry standards&rdquo; are not always what they
seem. Some companies or standardizing organizations attempt to
control standards through copyrights on specifications, or by
requiring payment for the use of certification marks to demonstrate
adherence to the standard. Such restrictive techniques are
fundamentally incompatible with open source and free
software.</p><p>Many of us in the Open Source community are working, often
behind the scenes, to convince companies to avoid restrictive
standards and to share control over such standards so as to make
them truly available under free and open-source terms. The good
news is that our input is increasingly being solicited, and that
the resulting standards are often now compatible with free and
open-source licensing.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
attorney-client relationship specifically with reference to all the
facts of a particular situation and the law of your jurisdiction.
