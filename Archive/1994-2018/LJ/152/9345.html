<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #152, December 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Jeff
Garzik</b></span> and others have unveiled a plan to do away with the
<span   class="bold"><b>IDE subsystem</b></span> entirely and completely
replace it with <span   class="bold"><b>libata</b></span>. This will not
happen immediately, and it will not happen all at once, but the plan does
seem to have universal support. Even the creator of the original IDE
subsystem, <span   class="bold"><b>Mark Lord</b></span>, thinks this is the way to go. For the immediate
future, all that's happening is that more code will merge from <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew
Morton</b></span>'s -mm tree into the official kernel, and users will have the option
to use that improved support for various hardware if they so choose. The
ultimate removal of the IDE subsystem is undoubtedly years away. Alan's
recent announcement is only one step down a long road.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>fork from ext3 to ext4</b></span> is a reality.
Once upon a time, adding features
like journaling to ext2 was considered so invasive that folks had to fork
ext3 in order to continue that kind of development. Now, the ext3 developers
have had to take the same steps in order to add invasive features, such
as
extents and large block sizes, to the code. <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> has stood firm on
the idea that the most relied-upon filesystems should not in themselves
undergo significant development, but should be rock solid and totally
dependable. Now, the new ext4 code is on the fast track to being included in
the official kernel. Whether it will ever be as popular as ext3 remains to
be seen. Meanwhile, folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Hans
Reiser</b></span> feel that ext4's easy entrance
into the official tree is just further proof of the favoritism he feels is
practiced within kernel development. What he doesn't understand is that
intelligence and coding ability are only part of the kernel development
culture. After all, one of Linus' great discoveries was that everyone has
the ability to contribute, and kernel developers don't all have to be
uber-hackers. They don't even have to be particularly nice guys, as
<span   class="bold"><b>Alexander Viro</b></span> and others proudly
proclaim. But, they do have to respond to
feedback and present their work in more or less standard ways. The more they
can be trusted to &ldquo;do the right thing&rdquo;, the easier it is to get their code
into the kernel.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Bunk</b></span> will maintain the <span   class="bold"><b>2.6.16 kernel</b></span> as a new stable tree. This has
roughly the same appearance as if we still had the old even/odd stability
model, Linus had forked 2.7 for intensive development, and Adrian were
going to maintain 2.6 for stability. The only difference, it seems, are the
names of the trees and the fact that Linus will not be stabilizing the
stable tree himself for any length of time. Adrian's work on 2.6.16 will
hopefully solve some of the issues users have had with the <span   class="bold"><b>w.x.y.z stable
tree</b></span> maintained by <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>Chris Wright</b></span>. That tree, although
aiming for run-time stability, did nothing to prevent interface changes
between 2.6 versions. Interface stability is not addressed at all by that
effort, while the 2.6.16 interfaces will not change under Adrian's
maintainership.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Pavel Machek</b></span> has released a driver for
<span   class="bold"><b>ThinkPad fingerprint sensors</b></span>. So far,
users have reported good success with it, though at the moment, it does seem
to have some easy-to-trigger failure modes. The big question for Pavel is
whether to leave this as a user-space tool or to migrate it into the kernel
proper. This is an interesting case, because typically anything that can
reasonably be left outside the kernel, would be. Although at the same
time, it
is also typical to keep hardware support inside the kernel, with few
exceptions. The direction of Pavel's code may influence where other drivers
will live in the future as well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Keith Packard</b></span> from <span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> has announced open-source drivers for
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel 965
Express Chipset family graphics controllers</b></span>, as part of ongoing work by the
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel Open Source Technology Center</b></span>. Intel seems to be doing the right thing
here, acknowledging that the code needs testing and bug fixes, and inviting
kernel folks to participate in development. One interesting detail quick to
be noticed on the kernel mailing list is that the code seems to be written
to interface with an unavailable binary blob, intel_hal.so, if available.
Keith explained, &ldquo;This module contains stuff that Intel can't publish in
source form, like Macrovision register stuff and other trade secrets. It's
optional, so if you don't want to use a binary module, you don't get to use
code written by Intel agents for these features....The driver remains
completely functional in the absence of the binary piece and, in fact, has no
reduction in functionality from previous driver releases.&rdquo;

<h2 class="title">Another Open Letter to Bill Gates</h2>
<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Dear Bill,
</p><p>
I hope you are enjoying yourself in retirement. I (of course) am
busy as ever trying to promote free software.
</p><p>
I read recently in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span> that you too have discovered
the freedom of information sharing! I read in an article that you are
insisting that researchers who receive your funding share their data,
tools and results with each other. Awesome! I know that you may think
this is another one of those &ldquo;innovations&rdquo; that you have come up with,
but I have to tell you that this is the very core of the Free Software
movement, and it has been going on for more than 35 years.
</p><p>
I remember back in 1969 when I was a student at Drexel University. I
found some computers in the basement of Drexel's main buildings that
did not come with software. In order to use these computers, I either
had to write the software or buy it.
</p><p>
A single copy of a compiler for some language might cost $100,000 US in those
days, and that was when a hundred thousand dollars was a lot of money!
I could not afford that on my small stipend for food and beer. But
there were people in the Digital Equipment User's Society that wrote
software and contributed it to the society's library for distribution
to other people. It was the study of this software that allowed me to
move into computer science. I have never forgotten that.
</p><p>
Of course, you may not have had the same enlightening experience. You went
to Harvard and probably could afford the compilers of those days&mdash;or
maybe you just used other people's machines and compilers to do your work.
</p><p>
In any case, as I left college and went out into the real world, I knew
that working as a team is better than working alone, so I continued to
push sharing code segments and even whole programs in order to make the
industry move forward.
</p><p>
I just got a couple of great ideas!
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
All of the software you fund should be Free Software.
</p></li><li><p>
Use only Free Software in your own work.
</p></li><li><p>
Buy medical equipment only if it is supported by
Free Software.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I am sure you will see how these fit into the basis of your new endeavors.
</p><p>
Warmest regards,
</p><p>
Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall

<h2 class="title">Microsoft's New Promise</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #152, December 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

In the Free Software and Open Source worlds, licensing has always been a
big deal. Choice of license has a direct effect on the usefulness of
code bases, and on their market growth as well.
</p><p>
Some code, however, makes use of standards that are open, yet to some
degree, proprietary. Those degrees are often controlled by patents.
Lately, much lawyerly thinking has gone into making those standards
useful to development efforts and to disarming the patents involved.
One of these&mdash;perhaps the first&mdash;is the Microsoft Open Specification
Promise. The Promise is short on legalese, yet too long to describe
here, beyond saying it's about what Microsoft won't sue others for,
providing others don't sue Microsoft. Lawrence Rosen, author of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Open
Source Licensing: Software Freedom and Intellectual Property
Law</em></span>
(Prentice Hall 2004), says the Promise &ldquo;...enables the Open Source
community to implement these standard specifications without having to
pay any royalties to Microsoft or sign a license agreement. I'm pleased
that this OSP is compatible with free and open-source licenses.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The first standards in question involve SOAP and a variety of protocols
from the WS-* portfolio. At the time of the Promise's announcement, in
mid-September, approving public statements were made by a variety of
folks on the open-source side of the table. These include Mark Webbink,
Deputy General Counsel of Red Hat, and R.L. &ldquo;Bob&rdquo; Morgan, Senior
Technology Architect at the University of Washington.
</p><p>
Before bringing the defenses up, bear in mind that this promise has been
hammered out through collaboration between open-friendly folks inside
Microsoft and countless cooperative conversations with folks from Red
Hat, Mozilla/Firefox, XRI/XDI, OpenID, LID, Sxip, Higgins, VeriSign and
others, including customer-side entities such as North Carolina State
University. The conversation has a name: OSIS, for Open Source Identity
Selector (or something like that...even the initialism is open to
change). Everybody involved is interested in developing open-source
implementations&mdash;or products that interoperate with&mdash;Microsoft's
CardSpace, an identity selector that will be released with Vista and
which Kim Cameron and others at Microsoft have for several years been
trying to make as interoperable as possible in a world where many other
identity systems will be in use. (See the Identity Metasystem article
from the September 2005 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.)
But, the Promise may end
up extending to other standards in other areas as well.
</p><p>
Disclosure: I've been involved in these discussions and have worked for
some time to help make them happen and to move forward. It's clear we
are at the beginning of something here, not an end.
</p><p>
Of course, the whole matter is open for input, debate and adjustment. To
help with that, here are some links:

<h2 class="title">Progress toward the Hackable Kidtop</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #152, December 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

One Laptop Per Child (<a href="http://laptop.org" target="_self">laptop.org</a>) hit the news in
January 2005 at Davos, when Nicholas Negroponte of the MIT Media Lab
announced plans for a &ldquo;$100 laptop&rdquo; in a quantity of 100 million, to
&ldquo;revolutionize the way we educate the world's children&rdquo;. Formal plans
for the project were announced in August, and we covered it for the
first time in the November 2005 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
</p><p>
Since then, much progress has been made. Jim Gettys
(<a href="http://www.handhelds.org/People/jg.html" target="_self">www.handhelds.org/People/jg.html</a>)&mdash;prime mover behind the X
Window System, handhelds.org (<a href="http://www.handhelds.org" target="_self">www.handhelds.org</a>) and earlier
fun projects like the Unobtainium (a wild hack on Compaq's original
iPAQ)&mdash;is now VP of Software Engineering. And, there are prototypes.
The current generation is fitted in bright orange and green and features
rectangular bunny ears (802.11s mesh network antennae); a lid that twists
and flips to form a pad; a dual-mode display that the project wiki
says, &ldquo;can readily be mass produced in standard LCD factories, with no
process changes&rdquo; and that &ldquo;has higher resolution than 95% of the laptop
displays on the market today, approximately 1/7th the power consumption,
1/3rd the price, sunlight readability and room-light readability with
the backlight off&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Although the units are designed for kids (the keyboard is 6/10 the size of
an adult one), they're also made to hack. Writing on his blog
(<a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/?p=824" target="_self">www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/?p=824</a>), Ethan Zuckerman says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...the 500 prototype boards currently built come with a VGA jack
soldered on, but production models will leave the jack leads etched
on the board, though unpopulated. Want to turn a laptop into a
device that can drive an external monitor? Solder one on. Also on
the board, but unpopulated, will be connectors for additional RAM and
Flash memory, as well as a mini-PCI slot.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And, although some large companies (AMD, Google, News Corp., and Red Hat) are
involved, the whole project is very much a work in progress, and it's open to
interest and help with what promises to become the most widespread and
good-hearted Linux deployment on earth.

<h2 class="title">Soweto: Power from the People</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">
Jon
 &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; 
Hall
</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #152, December 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In the spring of 2005, I attended LinuxWorld in Johannesburg, South
Africa. It was not my first time to South Africa, but this time, instead of going
to game reserves, I took a different trip after the event. A gentleman
I had met at LinuxWorld introduced me to Soweto.
</p><p>
Soweto is a township outside of Johannesburg. Before apartheid ended,
it was a township mostly of very poor black people. On June 16, 1976,
students were killed in riots in Soweto that led to the beginning of
the end for that rule of government called &ldquo;apartheid&rdquo;.
</p><p>
My guide and I went on a little tour, first to the Photography
Museum/School of Alf Kumalo. Dr Kumalo, who often risked his life to get
photographs that illustrated for the world the issues of apartheid, was
now using his talents and resources to teach young people in Soweto how to
be photographers. I saw they were using Adobe's Photoshop to manipulate
the digital images that the students were taking for composition
training. I pointed out that they should use GIMP instead, because the
students were unlikely to be able to afford Adobe Photoshop at home,
and therefore they would have to pirate Photoshop. I promised Paballo
Thekiso, the tutor that was my guide to the museum and school, that I
would send them a copy of GIMP and a book on how to use GIMP from the USA.
</p><p>
Then we left and went to the Soweto museum. I read a lot of the
information about what happened there, and as we looked out
across the natural bowl-shaped valley, I mentioned to my guide (who was
increasingly becoming my friend) that this would be a wonderful place for
a mesh network to deliver Internet services to the entire township. We
also talked about the benefits of FOSS and how there were no limitations
to what students could learn, other than their own desires, assuming they
had access to computer equipment and the Internet. I told him of several
&ldquo;success stories&rdquo; for this concept, including one about a person
who had been programming the kernel since the age of 12 and one about a
person
who had put out his own distribution at the age of 14. I bet him that
there were people in Soweto who could &ldquo;do Linux&rdquo;, given the opportunity.
</p><p>
We went to the house where his mother grew up and where his nephew
still lived. It was a two-room house, and he talked about how there were
sometimes two or three generations living in the same house. Although he
was glad his nephew was doing well in school and sports, he was
afraid that the nephew might turn to drugs, given the environment that
still prevailed in Soweto.
</p><p>
We finally had dinner in a great outdoor restaurant on the edge of the
township, where I experienced some of the local food and entrepreneurship
that was happening there.
</p><p>
Then we drove back to Johannesburg, and I flew home. What I did not know
was that my guide (and now friend) was Nhlanhla Mabaso, Open Source
Center Manager for the Meraka Institute, and that he had been listening to me.
</p><p>
During the next year, I tried to send two books and two open CDs to the
museum on two different occasions, and neither time did they get
through. Eventually, toward the end of the year I got them back, with
a note on them saying that they were &ldquo;undeliverable&rdquo;. It
cost me more than
$150 US to buy the books and mail them. When I got them back,
I was angry. Undaunted, I built into my 2006 LinuxWorld Johannesburg
schedule some time to travel to the Photography Museum and to carry
the books and CDs with me.
</p><p>
When I got my schedule from Aldean Prior, Director of Exhibits for Africa,
the LinuxWorld producer, I noticed there was built in to it a trip to the
Satellite Open Source Research Center that was opening as part of the
Meraka Institute. I did not think anything about it, but I did keep asking
to &ldquo;go back to Soweto&rdquo; so I could deliver the books to the museum. When I
got to Johannesburg, I found out that the Satellite Center was in Soweto,
and that I was invited to speak at the opening.
</p><p>
Nhlanhla drove me to Soweto that morning. We visited the museum, gave the
books and CDs to Paballo and found out that he knew one of the people
in the Center. We invited Paballo to the first training class the next
day, so he could establish contacts and learn more about Free Software.
</p><p>
The President and CEO of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research (CSIR), Dr Sibusiso Sibisi, spoke during the opening, as well as
Dr Ntsika Msimang and several other dignitaries. Dr Msimang is managing
the new center. After the rest of the ceremonies were over, Dr Sibisi came
over to me and said, &ldquo;You have no idea how influential your words
were.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Apparently, my conversation the previous year had inspired Nhlanhla to go
back to the Meraka Institute and make a presentation for investigating
the potential of opening an open-source research center and training
facility in Soweto and also to start to set up a mesh network for the
township. His team went to Soweto in August of that year and discovered
(during a presentation on FOSS) that several of the young people in the
audience already knew about Linux, could work with it and that one young man
named Bongani Hlope was doing kernel programming as a hobby and conversing
with Linus Torvalds via e-mail on kernel issues. Another person named Kgabo
Sepuru was running a FOSS consulting service out of his house in Soweto.
</p><p>
In addition, Nhlanhla's team found that local people already had started
to set up a mesh network in their broadband-deprived area.
</p><p>
On my second day at the satellite center, they had a day of training. That
day started off a bit slowly because it was their first day, but I believe
things will get better as they get settled in. Dr Msimang seems to be
a competent, enthusiastic director, and I contributed the first book to
their library.
</p><p>
In the meantime, Paballo, the tutor at the museum with whom I had been
corresponding via e-mail
all this time, got really excited about the rest of FOSS and said that
he was going to learn Linux and teach it to the rest of the photography
students. I promised to send some more books on other aspects of digital
photography and image rendering using free and open-source software.
</p><p>
I have had about five or six people come up to me in my life and say,
&ldquo;I
listened to you, followed your advice on FOSS, started my own company and
now I am a millionaire&rdquo; or &ldquo;I listened to you and it
changed my life&rdquo;,
but this was the first time I actually have seen direct action to this extent
on something I said almost in passing. I can't take credit
(nor do I want to) for the hard work that Nhlanhla and the rest of the
staff put into making the center a reality, but it sure felt good to
have someone like Dr Sibisi tell me those words.
</p><p>
Each of us affects the people around us with our every thought and deed. I
often tell people that if they want to see the most influential person in
free software, just look in the mirror when they get up. Lots of people
do not believe what I say, and others do. Sometimes the effect of what
we do and say goes way beyond what we know. I was fortunate enough to
see how influential my words were, and therefore, I encourage others
also to speak out and experience the same thing.
