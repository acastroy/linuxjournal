Asynchronous is the operative word with Ajax, and here's
what it's all about.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ca580.0x24c22f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
During the past few months, I've used this column to explore a number of
technologies and techniques related to Ajax, the asynchronous
JavaScript and XML paradigm that is the hottest thing in modern Web
development.  Everyone is scrambling to include Ajax on his or her sites,
and for good reason.  For users, Ajax applications appear more
responsive and desktop-like.  For developers, Ajax is attractive
because it breaks the one-page-per-click rule that has existed since
the beginning of the Web, making new types of applications possible.
</p><p>
In an Ajax application, a click might force a complete page reload, as
in a traditional Web application.  But, it might instead fire an HTTP
request in the background.  The response to this HTTP request is
handled (also in the background) by a JavaScript function, which can
use the content to modify some or all of the page.
</p><p>
If you have been developing Web applications for a while, you
might be wondering what the big deal is with Ajax.&gt; After all, it's
neither new nor difficult for a JavaScript function to modify the
current page via the DOM, is it? Perhaps not, but sometimes the
most powerful ideas result not from fancy technologies, but from the
clever combination of simple ones.  HTML, HTTP and URLs were all
fairly simple inventions, and they might not have gone very far on their
own.  But by combining them in just the right way, Tim Berners-Lee
launched a revolution that continues to this day.
</p><p>
Just as the Web has changed the way that we view publishing and
communication, Ajax has changed the way that we expect Web-based
applications to work.  Fortunately, working with Ajax requires only a
few skills above and beyond what Web developers needed to know until
now&mdash;particularly JavaScript, the DOM and CSS.
</p><p>
Last month, we built a small application that demonstrated the
improved usability that Ajax brings to the table.  As a visitor filled
out the HTML form with a requested user name, a JavaScript function
requested (via HTTP) a list of current user names from the server.  The
HTTP response contained a list of current users.  By checking to see
whether
the newly requested user name was on that list, it was possible to tell
the user in advance to choose something else.
</p><p>
This approach had many problems, but the two biggest ones
were scalability and security.  If our site becomes especially
popular, we will have many registered users, so sending a complete
list of user names will consume increasing amounts of CPU and
bandwidth.
</p><p>
In addition, it is a large security risk to send all of the user names
on a site to anyone who requests it.  The odds are good that at least
one of those users has chosen a poor password, which would make it
easy to assume that person's identity.  The implications of this security
breach depend on your users, your application and your country.  Some
countries' legal systems might even see this as a prosecutable
violation of database privacy laws.
</p><p>
So, for technical and security reasons alike, we need to find a better
solution.  An obvious candidate, and one we examine this
month, involves sending the proposed user name to the server via an
Ajax request.  The server's response will thus be a short
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; or
&ldquo;no&rdquo;, indicating whether the browser should allow or prevent
registration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ca580.0x24c2710"></a>
Ajax Requests</h2></div></div><p>
An Ajax application consists of several parts:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
A JavaScript function, defined in the Web page, that is invoked
when a particular event happens.  These event handler functions
are common in the JavaScript world, even without Ajax.  Before CSS,
for example, it was common to use JavaScript to change the src
attribute for an img tag whenever the mouse would hover over it
(the onmouseover event) or move off of it (the onmouseout
event).  In the case of Ajax, the event handler function doesn't
manipulate the DOM, but rather it sends an asynchronous HTTP request
using the XMLHttpRequest object.
</p><p>
In our example application, the JavaScript function will create an
XMLHttpRequest object and use it to invoke a program residing on
the server.  As a parameter to the request, we will send the contents of
the username text field.
</p></li><li><p>
A server-side program that expects to receive the HTTP request,
along with one or more parameters, and produces an appropriate
HTTP response.  The response theoretically may be in any
legitimate MIME format, although XML, plain text and JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) appear to be the most popular
choices.
The server-side program will almost certainly not be written in
JavaScript.  You can choose the language in which you write this
program, as well as the method in which it is invoked.  The key is
that it has access to the resources you need, such as a database,
and that it can produce the output in the format you want.
In this month's example application, the server-side program
takes the username parameter and looks in the database to see if
it is already in use.  The XML that it returns will indicate its
findings.
</p></li><li><p>
A second JavaScript function, also defined in the user's Web
browser, that is invoked when the HTTP response is received.
This callback function, as it is sometimes known, receives
the HTTP response and then acts on it.  Our callback routine will
thus need to parse the Ajax HTTP response and then use the DOM to
modify the current page as necessary.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ca580.0x24c2ad8"></a>
Improving Our Programs</h2></div></div><p>
Given the above list, how can we move from the simple program we wrote
last month to one that will fulfill our scalability and security
requirements?
</p><p>
When we created our simple Ajax user name-checking program in last
month's column, we used two of these three elements.  We created an
HTML form (shown in Listing 1) that would let people register with
our Web site by entering a user name, password and e-mail address.  We
then indicated that whenever the username text field was changed, the
checkUsername JavaScript function should be invoked:

<pre     class="programlisting">

   &lt;input type="text" name="username" onchange="checkUsername()" /&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
checkUsername then asked our server&mdash;the same server from which the
current page of HTML came&mdash;for the contents of a text file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   function checkUsername() {
      // Send the HTTP request
   xhr.open("GET", "usernames.txt", true);
   xhr.onreadystatechange = parseUsernames;
   xhr.send(null);
   }
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the first place where we will need to make a change.
Rather than send a GET request without any parameters to request a
static document, we will send a POST request with a single parameter
(username), which will result in the execution of a server-side
program.
</p><p>
Finally, our callback routine (parseUsernames) iterated over the
list of user names that the server had sent, using the DOM to warn the
user if it found a match.  This is the other place where we will
need to make a change.  But in this case, the change will be a
simplification.  No longer will we need to parse through the
user names sent by the server.  Instead, we will need to identify
only whether the response was positive or negative.

</pre></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23ca580.0x24c2fa8"></a>
Sending a POST Request</h2></div></div><p>
Last month's version of the program sent a GET request.  It is
possible, and even common, to send one or more parameters with a GET
request.  Those parameters are then stuck onto the URL, as follows:
http://www.example.com/foo.pl?param1=value1&amp;param2=value2.
</p><p>
A separate type of request, known as POST, puts the parameters inside
of the request body.  This has several advantages, including cleaner
URLs and no limit on the length of the parameter names and values.
(Many browsers limit the total size of a URL, which includes the
parameters for a GET request.)
</p><p>
Although it is not strictly necessary for us to use a POST request for
this example program, it is good to see how we can pass parameters in
our request.  And indeed, it is quite easy to do so.  Compare the
following code (taken from Listing 2) with the similar excerpt above
(from Listing 1):

<pre     class="programlisting">
   function checkUsername() {
      // Send the HTTP request
   xhr.open("POST", "/cgi-bin/check-name-exists.pl", true);
   xhr.onreadystatechange = parseResponse;

   var username = document.forms[0].username.value;
      xhr.send("username=" + escape(username));
   }
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, we have changed the first two parameters to xhr.open
to be POST (instead of GET) and to point to a program that will
generate dynamic output.  The third parameter, which tells the
XMLHttpRequest object that it should make the query in the background
(that is, asynchronously), remains set to true.  I also changed the
name of the callback routine to parseResponse, from parseUsername.
</p><p>
The other change is that we are now sending parameters to the server.
The variable queryString is just a string consisting of name-value
pairs, in the traditional Web format of:

<pre     class="programlisting">

   param1=value1&amp;param2=value2

</pre>
</p><p>
We thus build such a query string, and send it to the server.

The Server Side</h2></div></div><p>
Ajax is almost exclusively a client-side paradigm.  And, indeed, it is
increasingly clear that we can use JavaScript in general, and Ajax in
particular, to create new and interesting applications and interfaces.
That said, server-side programs still have a major role to play in Web
applications, including Ajax applications.
</p><p>
To begin with, only server-side programs can access the site's
relational database.  (And yes, it's theoretically possible to have
JavaScript access the database directly, but that would be a
security and performance nightmare.) This means everything
you normally would store in a database, but want to have displayed in
the browser, will need to be filtered through a server-side program.
Almost any nontrivial application will thus benefit from being part
of a larger Web framework, such as Zope, Ruby on Rails or even a
roll-your-own system that encapsulates behavior in a set of related
methods or functions.  In other words, the server-side programs in an
Ajax application become very specialized database query and reporting
tools.
</p><p>
In the interests of time and space, we don't access a database this
month.  However, there is no way for the HTTP client to know whether
the HTTP server is checking a database or returning a random result, and we will take advantage of this secrecy to fudge the lack of a
database.  If we decide at some point to modify our server-side
program to retrieve a list of user names from a database instead of
hard-coding the list in a hash, that will be just fine.
</p><p>
Our server-side program, check-name-exists.pl (Listing 3), is a simple CGI program
written in Perl.  We turn the POSTDATA parameter, which we have
received from the Ajax request, and look inside it to see if we
received a setting for username.  If so, we then look for a match
among the keys of the %usernames hash.  If we find a match, it
returns yes to the caller.  If there is no match, it returns
no.

Notice how we use a hash, rather than an array, to store the
user names.  This is a hack for the sake of efficiency; the time it
takes to find an array element (and see if there is a match) is
proportional to the number of elements in the array.  By contrast,
hash key lookups take constant time, regardless of how many elements
there are.  In a production setting, we obviously would expect to look
for user names in a database or server-side disk file, rather than a
hash or an array.
</p><p>
This example also demonstrates one way to mock up an Ajax application
while development is still taking place&mdash;create a server-side program
that produces results for a very small subset of the data, simulating
the full range of database queries that you might normally want to
use.  In this way, development on the JavaScript side of the project
will not have to wait for the server-side portion to be complete,
allowing for more parallelized development.

Parsing the Response</h2></div></div><p>
When the response arrives from the server, our callback routine,
parseResponse, is invoked.  As always, we wait until the readyState of
our XMLHttpRequest is 4 and for the HTTP status code to be 200.  At
that point, we can expect one of four different responses from the
server:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A yes response indicates that the user name was taken.  We disable
the form's submit button and display a warning.  If and when the
user changes the text inside of the username text field, the
warning will be removed and the submit button re-enabled.
</p></li><li><p>
A no response indicates that the user name is available.  We remove
any warning that might have been placed, and enable the submit
button.
</p></li><li><p>
An empty response might come before the yes or no, in which case
we ignore it.
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, it's possible that our program will not behave precisely as
we might expect.  If this happens, we display the unexpected
response that we received for debugging purposes.  This is the sort
of thing you would probably want to remove from production
code.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Notice how we used a switch statement to look at the different
possibilities.  Also notice how we were able to reduce the complexity
of our JavaScript code by sharing the work with the server.  This is
the key to a good Ajax application.  Rather than having the client or
the server do all of the work itself, each of them shares in the
burden, doing what it can do fastest and most cleanly.
</p><p>
Finally, you might notice that for all of our talk about XML&mdash;it is,
after all, the x in Ajax&mdash;there was a distinct lack of XML in
this application.  True, we used the XMLHttpRequest to send HTTP
requests to the server, but what happened to the XML?
</p><p>
The truth is that Ajax is a great name, but it doesn't quite describe
the range of options the programming paradigm provides.  The HTTP
response, as I indicated above, can come in any MIME type, although
XML and plain text are the most common.  If this
application were returning a more sophisticated set of data, such as a
store inventory or points for a chart, XML might be more
appropriate.  Another format that is gaining in popularity is JSON,
which resembles Perl's &ldquo;Data::Dumper&rdquo; in its representation of
JavaScript objects.  Ajax is merely a technique for dividing the work
between the client and the server; you should not feel compelled to use
XML for the data transfer if it is inappropriate for the task at hand.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This month, we finally produced an application worthy of the Ajax
moniker.  We used a combination of JavaScript (on the client side) and
Perl (on the server side) to check whether a user name was already
taken.  In doing so, we saw how to use the POST method for submitting
data and sent a named parameter to the server.  In making these
changes, we turned a simple, insecure and unscalable program into a
relatively secure and scalable one, without sacrificing the immediate
response and interactivity that Ajax brings to the table.
</p><p>
At the same time, you might have noticed our HTML page contained a
large number of functions that will be useful for a wide variety of
Ajax applications.  Starting next month, we will look at some of the
open-source libraries that make it easier to create Ajax applications,
allowing you to concentrate on the higher-level details.
