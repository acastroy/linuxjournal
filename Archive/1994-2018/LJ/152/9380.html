For the corrected version of the article, please see: <a href="../152/8337.html" target="_self">/article/8337</a>
   </p><p>
This page contains updates to the article, as well as some important
security information for running your VPS.
</p><p>
Thanks again to Sean Reifschneider, Evelyn Mitchell and the rest of
the Tummy.com crew for their very helpful suggestions and for letting
me use their equipment once more, to test the updates presented here.
</p><p>
While you can still get a VPS based on Fedora Core 3, the system used
for the article, you may want something more recent. For example,
CentOS 4.4, which derives from Red Hat Enterprise Linux, requires only
minor deviations from the directions in the article text. The CentOS
project home page is at <a href="http://www.centos.org" target="_self">www.centos.org</a>.
</p><p>
The following notes update the instructions from Fedora Core 3 to
CentOS 4.4. Tummy.com offers both variants, as well as several others,
including Ubuntu and Debian.

Firewall Settings</h2></div></div><p>
When you configure the firewall with
<tt  >system-config-securitylevel-tui</tt>, the text-based GUI may not render correctly in your terminal. If this
makes it
difficult to use the application, try running the terminal program
with the UTF-8 character encoding.
</p><p>
For example, <tt  >xterm -u8</tt> should launch a UTF-8
<tt  >xterm</tt>. In <tt  >gnome-terminal</tt>, select
Terminal&rarr;Set Character Encoding&rarr;Unicode (UTF-8)
from the menu bar in order to enable UTF-8.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16bb580.0x17b36b8"></a>
Postfix Mail Server</h2></div></div><p>
You will need to update the last two lines of Listing 1, as the
Postfix mail server version has changed. Here is the new code.
</p><pre     class="programlisting">sample_directory = /usr/share/doc/postfix-2.2.10/samples

readme_directory = /usr/share/doc/postfix-2.2.10/README_FILES</pre><p>
Note that the sample_directory parameter is obsolete since version
2.1 of Postfix.
</p><p>
When testing your mail server by telnetting to port 25, you may find it
blocked by your local ISP. Many DSL and cable providers do this now.
</p><p>
It is quite simple to configure Postfix so it listens on a
non-standard port, such as 10025, in addition to port 25. Edit the
file /etc/postfix/master.cf. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Note that
this is not the main.cf file that you worked with
in Listing 1</em></span>. Near the top, you will find the following
lines:
</p><pre     class="programlisting"># =======================================================================
# service  type  private  unpriv  chroot  wakeup   maxproc  command + args
#                (yes)    (yes)   (yes)   (never)  (100)
# =======================================================================
      smtp   inet    n        -       n       -       -       smtpd</pre><p>
Add the following line, after the &ldquo;smtp&rdquo; line.
</p><pre     class="programlisting">10025     inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd</pre><p>
Next, restart Postfix: <tt  >/etc/init.d/postfix
restart</tt>.
</p><p>
Finally, re-run the
<tt  >system-config-securitylevel-tui</tt>
utility as described in the article. On the &ldquo;Customize&rdquo; screen, add
10025 to the &ldquo;Other ports&rdquo; text box. If there
are other entries in this textbox, scroll to the last one, add a
space, and make the new, additional entry. &ldquo;OK&rdquo; your changes and
restart iptables, as discussed in the article.
</p><p>
From your workstation, you can now telnet to port 10025 on your VPS
instead of port 25, to carry out the tests described in the article.
After sending these hand-generated test messages, remember to check
the Spam folder at the receiving end. Unusual formatting, such as
the lack of a subject, of these e-mail messages may cause them to be flagged
as junk.
</p><p>
While on the subject of spam, the problem is getting worse, as you
probably know. Listing 1 in the article uses
<tt  >luser_relay</tt>
to deliver mail for unknown recipients to a specific user on the
system. This is very convenient, because you can just invent e-mail
addresses, and they will work without any configuration changes.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, <tt  >luser_relay</tt> may expose you to a lot more
spam. If this happens, you will need to add all your legitimate
addresses to /etc/aliases and comment out
<tt  >luser_relay</tt>. The article text describes how to
work with /etc/aliases.

Dovecot for POP3 and IMAP</h2></div></div><p>
When setting up Dovecot to provide POP3
and IMAP service, the newer configuration file may look a little
different.
</p><p>
In CentOS 4.4, the default configuration has the protocols line
commented out. It is also changed from what appears in the article
text:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">#protocols = imap imaps</pre><p>
Do not be confused by these minor differences; just add the code as
described in the article: <tt  >protocols = pop3 imap</tt> in this
case. Dovecot will still work correctly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16bb580.0x17b41b8"></a>
Reading and Sending Mail</h2></div></div><p>
There are no substantial changes&mdash;only the dialog boxes may look
slightly different in later versions of Mozilla Thunderbird. There
is also a &ldquo;Description&rdquo; field in the SMTP server dialog, which you
may leave blank.
</p><p>
If you are using the mutt-based solution described in the article, no
modifications are required.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16bb580.0x17b4370"></a>
Web-based Mail</h2></div></div><p>
When configuring SquirrelMail, it is
possible that the Web server is already running. In this case,
starting it, as described in the article, will have no effect.
</p><p>
Try restarting the Web server instead, especially if you are having
trouble opening SquirrelMail's pages in your browser:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">/etc/init.d/httpd restart</pre><p>
You may use the restart command even if the server is not running. In
this case, the attempt to stop the server will fail, but the
subsequent start operation will proceed normally.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16bb580.0x17b4580"></a>
SSH Security</h2></div></div><p>
Extremely broad Internet sweeps that look for SSH access at many IP
addresses seem to have become widespread in late 2004. Here are some
insightful descriptions of the problem, and several solutions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<a href="http://www.tummy.com/journals/entries/jafo_20041029_151145" target="_self">www.tummy.com/journals/entries/jafo_20041029_151145</a>
</p></li><li><p>
<a href="http://www.tummy.com/journals/entries/jafo_20050716_152920" target="_self">www.tummy.com/journals/entries/jafo_20050716_152920</a>
</p></li><li><p>
<a href="http://www.tummy.com/journals/entries/jafo_20050724_172920" target="_self">www.tummy.com/journals/entries/jafo_20050724_172920</a>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
One relatively simple change that you can implement quickly is moving
your SSH d&aelig;mon, sshd, to a nonstandard
port. This measure&mdash;although weak from a theoretical security
perspective&mdash;is currently very effective in deterring the generic
SSH sweeps that do not specifically target your system.
</p><p>
Carefully perform the following steps, in the order given:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Modify your firewall settings to permit access on a
nonstandard port, such as 2222.
</p></li><li><p>
Restart iptables: <tt  >/etc/init.d/iptables restart</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Add the directive &ldquo;Port 2222&rdquo; to
/etc/ssh/sshd_config.
</p></li><li><p>
Restart sshd: <tt  >/etc/init.d/sshd restart</tt>.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Do not log out from the server.</em></span> If you
are unable to carry out step 5 below, you may still be able to
double-check the configuration and make changes from your
original SSH session. Of course, your VPS hosting company
should help if you completely lock yourself out.
</p></li><li><p>
Open another terminal, and log in to your VPS with
<tt  >ssh -p 2222 root@MY.VPS.IP.ADDRESS</tt>.
Note that from now on, you will always need to specify this
nonstandard port number when you access your VPS using SSH.
Alternatively, you can edit the .ssh/config
file in your home directory, and configure the nonstandard
port there&mdash;see the SSH documentation for details. You can
create this file if it does not currently exist.
</p></li><li><p>
Optional step. Modify your firewall settings again, and
disable SSH access on port 22. If you are using
<tt  >system-config-securitylevel-tui</tt>, this is
done by unchecking the &ldquo;SSH&rdquo; checkbox on the &ldquo;Customize&rdquo; screen.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16bb580.0x1bad430"></a>
Additional Information</h2></div></div><p>
The Postfix home page, at <a href="http://www.postfix.org" target="_self">www.postfix.org</a>, has lots of
information
about the Postfix MTA. You can also read an excellent introduction to
Postfix at <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2003/08/21/postfix.html" target="_self">www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2003/08/21/postfix.html</a>.
Note that this article covers an earlier version of the server, so
there are some configuration differences from the current version.
</p><p>
Finally, Wikipedia has a brief but very insightful description of
e-mail terminology, at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_transfer_agent" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_transfer_agent</a>.
