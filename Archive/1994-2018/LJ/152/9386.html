Pearson Technology Group's Digital Short Cuts</h2></div></div><p>
Getting cutting-edge IT information from an author's brain to
yours more quickly is the mission of Short Cuts, a new line of digital documents from
Pearson Technology Group (PTG). Short Cuts are &ldquo;concise PDF documents
about a cutting-edge technology that shows great promise, or an existing
technology that has reached the 'tipping point' and is about to take
off&rdquo;, says PTG. The rationale is that when a hot topic comes along,
many readers don't want to wait the extra weeks or months needed for
the information finally to reach the printed page. Despite the rapid
availability, PTG claims that Short Cuts retain the &ldquo;same level of quality,
accuracy, knowledge, and insight&rdquo; as printed books. The titles span
a wide range of IT topics from Pearson's various imprints, including
Addison-Wesley Professional, Cisco Press, Exam Cram and Prentice Hall
Professional, among others.

ITTIA DB</h2></div></div><p>
ITTIA just released version 1.1 of ITTIA DB, the firm's self-titled,
flagship database for deployment in mobile and embedded platforms.
ITTIA says that its fully cross-platform database offers developers
&ldquo;fine-grain control over how system resources are used in order to produce
efficient mobile and embedded applications...where the limited memory,
storage and processing power requirements make software development
challenging.&rdquo; This upgraded version boasts an enhanced C API, increased
control over storage size for each file type, an improved interface for
accessing BLOB data, modified transaction handling for improved tracking
of resource-acquisition bugs and other performance and configuration
enhancements. ITTIA notes that many customers utilize its product on
embedded Linux platforms, for instance, &ldquo;HVAC controller systems, physical
access control devices and consumer electronics&rdquo;. You can get an evaluation copy
of ITTIA DB from the company's Web site.

Mercury Computer Systems' MultiCore Plus SDK</h2></div></div><p>
The MultiCore Plus SDK from Mercury Computer Systems, now free from
the bonds of beta at version 1.0, is a seamless package of software
development tools and libraries that enables its users to exploit
the Cell Broadband Engine (BE) and other multicore processors fully.
According to Mercury, the SDK &ldquo;includes a comprehensive programming
framework, highly optimized math libraries and a graphical IDE with
powerful debug and analysis tools&rdquo;.  Furthermore, supported on the
open-source Linux distro for the Cell BE processor, the SDK complements
components of the IBM SDK. The beta version of the product has been
present in applications, such as aerospace and defense, seismic/geologic,
semiconductor, life sciences, digital media and national labs. Both
Mercury and IBM also offer a range of Cell BE processor-based products.

SpectSoft's RaveHD</h2></div></div><p>
Yes, folks, RaveHD is a bit esoteric...but that's what makes it so cool!
RaveHD's producer, SpectSoft, recently released a major new upgrade to
its non-version-numbered product, which is a combination video transport
recorder (VTR) and file server for film production. Utilizing Linux
and its own in-house software app, RaveHD stores industry-standard DPX
frames and makes them accessible via the network, or it can feed those
frames to an onboard I/O board as a video stream. DPX frames allow
timecode, audio and other material to be packed into each individual
frame. The RaveHD hardware must sustain 300Mbps for a video stream
for both ingest and playout. However, the hardware exceeds this by far,
making RaveHD an ideal file server to feed these frames into other apps.
Other tools support particular work flows in the film industry, &ldquo;such
as VFX for dailies and feature film for ingest on-set&rdquo;, says SpectSoft.
RaveHD's latest major features include an auto-router, which &ldquo;allows the
easy routing of any of the SD, HD or Dual Link formats to the various
features within the I/O board&rdquo;, as well as a JPEG push that converts any
frame to a JPEG and pushes it either to the RaveHD GUI or any browser.
Hey
Mom, I know what I want for Christmas!

Kyliptix Solutions' KiBS CRM</h2></div></div><p>
The KiBS CRM is a Web-enabled, SaaS-based CRM module for small- and
medium-sized businesses, offering &ldquo;integrated sales, marketing,
customer service and support&rdquo; together in one package. It is the
first application in the Kyliptix Integrated Business Suite (KiBS), which is
targeted at small- and mid-sized businesses. Kyliptix claims that KiBS
&ldquo;is
capable of integrating with existing front- and back-office
applications&rdquo;,
meaning that customers are &ldquo;no longer forced to engage a system
integrator to create problematic patch code to ensure interoperability and
communication between the multiple software applications&rdquo;. By working
with existing data rather than replicating or porting data to other
locations, says Kyliptix, &ldquo;KiBS eliminates compatibility issues and
errors stemming from improper synchronizations&rdquo;. KiBS is built upon a
LAMP platform and utilizes an Ajax methodology. Additional modules are
forthcoming, according to the company.

Joseph Weber and Tom Newberry's <span   class="emphasis"><em>IPTV Crash Course</em></span>
(McGraw-Hill)</h2></div></div><p>
Getting your TV fix delivered to you via IP is becoming ever more common,
and one way to understand that universe better is with
Joseph Weber and Tom Newberry's new book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>IPTV Crash Course</em></span>. This work is an
&ldquo;accessible overview&rdquo; of IPTV&mdash;that is, the convergence of the Internet and
digital video technology. Its mission is to &ldquo;explain the fundamentals
of IPTV&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;how the business models of service carriers
will change&rdquo; due to the utilization of new technologies. Although much of
the tech stuff will be familiar to most of us, the societal and economic
impacts that are covered here are likely to tickle both the suit and
the geek alike.
