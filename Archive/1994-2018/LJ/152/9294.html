Maddog continues his framework for a good conference by
considering the suits.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd09580.0xe013a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The planning for the conference at the Universidade Federal de Santa
Catarina in Florianopolis, Brazil was proceeding well. Several tracks had
been selected for the technical subjects, and the planning committee had
put out a call for papers and selected several &ldquo;invited
talks&rdquo; from
speakers on topics they knew would be of interest to everyone&mdash;at
least to all the techies.
</p><p>
But today, the organizers wanted to plan some conference topics for
business people&mdash;managers who might not understand free software from a
technical perspective and who would be bored by sessions on the brilliance
of the emacs text editor.
</p><p>
&ldquo;What about the <span   class="emphasis"><em>suits</em></span>?&rdquo;, asked JR, &ldquo;What types of things should we do
for them?&rdquo;
</p><p>
I told JR that it is hard to get business people for even one day,
and that you have to develop a special program for them. Also, their
interests do not lie in technical subjects, but in making and
saving money. Often their interests also relate to better products
or customer service that can come from the careful application of free
software.
</p><p>
We decided to set up a short four-hour conference for the business
people, starting with a breakfast sponsored by a few computer vendors.
The sponsorship would pay for the room, food and travel for some
of the speakers.
</p><p>
&ldquo;First, we will discuss briefly what free software is, and make it clear
that the real value to the software is the freedom to change it to
meet your needs&rdquo;, I said. &ldquo;Some managers think that low cost is the
only value.&rdquo;
</p><p>
We also decided to ask a local computer magazine to send one of its
writers to discuss subjects such as &ldquo;where to use free software in the
enterprise&rdquo; and &ldquo;how to migrate and interoperate using free
software&rdquo;.
We knew this writer would be fair to free software and would tell
customers the truth about how it would fit in to their environment.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Next, we need case studies&rdquo;, I said. The best way of convincing
business people that something will work is to show them another similar
business person making money with free software. This makes the attendees
see success, and later they can become your best case studies for future
events, after they have been successful in their own businesses.
</p><p>
&ldquo;How do we find these case studies?&rdquo;, Carlos asked. I
answered, &ldquo;You can go to the
Web sites of your sponsoring companies or of local magazines and
see if they have any articles about companies similar to the ones that
you want to invite to your event. Often the sponsoring companies would
be happy to work with their customers to get them to come to your event,
and perhaps they will even sponsor the customer's travel to speak at
your event.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Other items where business people want clarification are licensing,
where to get support, where to get training and other business issues
associated with using free software.
</p><p>
After the meeting is over, the business people can talk to the vendors
at the vendor exhibit, so the breakfast room would have to be near the
main event.
</p><p>
A lot of conferences do not like to have vendor exhibits, but I like
having a small vendor exhibit area just to allow attendees to see &ldquo;the
latest and greatest&rdquo; of the vendors' wares. It is recommended, however,
to tell the vendors that you want tabletop displays, small displays
that do not take up much room or resources, and that they should mirror the
themes of the conference. If the conference deals with multimedia,
you might invite vendors who make sound cards, solid-state music
players, midi instruments and so on to your event&mdash;particularly if these
work with free software. If your theme is rapid development, you might
invite
vendors of compiler suites, test harnesses and so on.
</p><p>
You also should recommend that vendors send some technical people
who can answer technical questions, as well as marketing people.
</p><p>
Do not forget to invite the .org groups. These are often the most
popular exhibits&mdash;a lot of the .org people are doing some really
innovative and fun things. Also remember that .orgs usually have
even less money than small start-up companies, so often you have to
donate the booth to them or sell it to them at a real discount.
And, any money you can save the vendors on items such as electricity and
Internet support, which is typically very expensive in large venues,
will be appreciated twice over by the .org people.
</p><p>
&ldquo;What about advertising?&rdquo;, asked Dennis.
</p><p>
Although advertising is key, so is timing. These days, the Web is used
to allow last-minute changes to programs, accommodations, travel tips
and other things, but unless your Web site motivates attendees to
come on the first viewing, you may never get them to come back for a
second viewing. So, you need to make sure that enough information is
available the first time potential attendees go to your site to
make them register, and then update it with small items and changes as necessary.
</p><p>
Things necessary on the first showing of the Web site are location,
time, themes for the event, main speakers (and hopefully the main
speakers' topics, abstracts and bios), and fees (if any) to attend.
The more speakers you have lined up by the time you take your Web site
live, the better the Web site is for your event. A Web site with a lot of
blank spaces does not inspire people to come to an event.
</p><p>
Although you should not advertise your site too early, you also should not
advertise too late, as people make plans and may not be able to attend
your event simply due to conflicting arrangements. With earlier warning,
they might be able to reschedule the conflicting event or have
enough time to talk their employers into sending them to the conference.
</p><p>
Once the Web site is ready, look for places to get low-cost or free
advertising. Most Linux and PC magazines and on-line portals have
event calendars. Most would be happy to include your event in those
calendars. Local and public radio shows also have community calendars
where they announce local events for free. University bulletin boards,
library calendars and local newspapers are also good places to place
small advertisements.
</p><p>
Entrance fees are always a touchy subject. A lot of free
software people want everything to be free, not realizing that floor
space, custodial care, security guards, insurance needs, electricity
and Internet usage cost money. Some events charge very little to the
attendees and get all of their money from sponsors and vendor sales.
Often these low-cost events do not supply food to the attendees and instead
have some type of meal plan available for a small fee or suggest that
people eat outside of the event at a restaurant of their own choosing.
</p><p>
I have seen some free events, such as LinuxTAG in Germany, put together
a small bag of goodies, such as donated CD-ROM collections, T-shirts and
other donations from vendors, which are then sold to the attendees to
raise money. And, some people either pass the hat for donations or
raffle off items, such as a T-shirt signed by all the speakers. One time
such a T-shirt brought several thousand dollars for the organizers to
help cover costs.
</p><p>
Finally, have fun with your event. Putting together a one- or two-day
conference should not be a person- and relationship-killing proposition.
By planning ahead, you should be able to take the time to plan events
without burning out anyone.
