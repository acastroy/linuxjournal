How to set up two-factor authentication using a USB pendrive and
ssh-agent for root logins.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1117450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I enthusiastically use two-factor authentication whenever possible, because
static passwords aren't the best mechanism around any moat.  Traditional
passwords are vulnerable to social engineering, key-loggers, yellow
post-it notes and&mdash;especially as computers become ever faster&mdash;to cracking.  Tossing them in favor of two-factor authentication is a
good idea and helps me sleep better at night.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, network-based, commercial two-factor systems are generally
too expensive and complex to use at home or on small networks.  But, guess
what? You already have the necessary parts on your Linux computer to build
a two-factor authentication system.  The ubiquitous secure communication
tool, OpenSSH, provides all the tools necessary to create a host-based,
two-factor authentication system suitable for the home, small office
and even larger networks.
</p><p>
This article describes how to combine removable media with OpenSSH
public/private keys and the amazing ssh-agent program to achieve
two-factor authentication for both regular and privileged users.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1117608"></a>
Example 1: Two-Factor User Authentication Using USB Drives</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start by creating two-factor authentication for regular
(nonroot) users.  In this case, we use the well-known SSH public
key authentication facility with a small twist.  Rather than store the
private key in the .ssh subdirectory of your home directory, as is the
default, we'll place it on a USB pendrive.
</p><p>
For this example, you'll be logged in as the nonprivileged user bob on
a Fedora Core computer, machine1.  You'll connect to the remote
Linux box machine2 as bob.
</p><p>
Let's start by creating the public/private key pair that we'll use to
log in to machine2:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f key-rsa-bob@machine2 -C key-rsa-bob@machine2
</pre>
</p><p>
Enter a passphrase when prompted (the longer and more random the
better).  By default, the ssh-keygen program creates the key pair
in the subdirectory .ssh in your home directory&mdash;in this case,
/home/bob/.ssh.  For this example, I've chosen an arbitrary yet descriptive
filename to help identify the intended user and hostname at a glance;
this will be important in the succeeding examples, which use multiple
keys.  (I'm assuming the USB drive is formatted with a Linux filesystem like ext3; vfat works, but you'll need to change the key's file
permissions to 400 after every mount.)
</p><p>
Mount your USB pendrive, and you should see it as as /media/usbdisk,
/media/usbdisk1, /media/disk or /media/disk-1.  Move your newly created
private key to the appropriate directory and limit access to the owner:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   mv key-rsa-bob@machine2 /media/usbdisk
   chmod 400 /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-bob@machine2
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, copy the public key (key-rsa-bob@machine2.pub) into the
/home/bob/.ssh/authorized_keys file on machine2.  Make the
authorized_keys file readable only by the owner:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   chmod 400 authorized_keys
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you can log in to the remote computer, machine2, from machine1, as bob,
using the public/private key pairs (the -i option tells the ssh client
what key to use):

<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh -i /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-bob@machine2 bob@machine2
</pre>
</p><p>
Type in the private key passphrase when prompted, and the OpenSSH
server on machine2 logs you in.  Unmount and remove the USB device (or
removable disc) on machine1, and your private key is protected.  You've
achieved two-factor authentication: one factor is the key stored on the
USB device that you can keep separate from your computer, and the second
one is the passphrase you store in your head.
</p><p>
Using SSH public key authentication is a common and familiar process to
many.  Putting the private key onto removable media is a simple way of
physically separating one factor from another.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1117b30"></a>
Example 2: Two-Factor Root Authentication Using ssh-agent</h2></div></div><p>
Example 1 shows how to log in to a remote machine securely using a USB
device to separate one authentication factor from another.  This works
well when logging in as a nonprivileged user but not as root.  We have
to find a way to log in remotely as the superuser.
</p><p>
One solution would be simply to extend the previous example's method
and configure the remote OpenSSH server to allow root logins directly
from the network.  No passwords or keys will traverse the network, but
we would violate the age-old system administration prohibition against
directly logging in as root.  No shortcuts should be allowed, so we have to figure
out how to first log in as a regular user and then as root.
</p><p>
Once again, OpenSSH comes to the rescue.  In this case, we continue
to use public/private keys but introduce a configuration twist.  First,
configure the remote SSH service to allow root logins via the internal
loopback interface but not the external network.  Second, configure the
ssh-agent utility to allow the remote machine to authenticate root by
querying the keys stored on the local machine.
</p><p>
Here's how the process works:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Create a private/public key pair for root on the local machine.
</p></li><li><p>
Copy the public key into root's authorized_users file on the remote
machine.
</p></li><li><p>
Run the ssh-add utility locally to cache the private key.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >ssh</tt> to the remote machine and log in as a regular user as described in
Example 1; however, this time use the agent-forwarding option.
</p></li><li><p>
On the remote machine, <tt  >ssh</tt> to the localhost interface as the root
user.  The remote OpenSSH d&aelig;mon queries the local agent, authenticates
root, and you can log in as the superuser.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The ssh-agent utility provides just the functionality we're looking for.
It allows remote SSH d&aelig;mons to authenticate users by querying the
locally stored cache of decrypted private keys.  Keys are never transmitted
between machines&mdash;the private keys remain stored on removable media on
your local workstation.
</p><p>
ssh-agent is powerful, but setting it up can be tricky.  First, you need
to use the ssh-add utility to decrypt your private key and hand it to
ssh-agent.  Second, you need to tell ssh-add how to communicate with
ssh-agent.  ssh-add communicates with ssh-agent via a socket, whose
location is stored in the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environmental
variable.  By default, ssh-agent creates sockets with arbitrary names,
and setting SSH_AUTH_SOCK correctly can take some work.
</p><p>
Fortunately, many Linux distributions, including Fedora Core,
automatically set up the necessary ssh-agent/ssh-add connections when you
log in graphically (such as on GNOME or KDE).  Log in at the console, open a terminal
console and type the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh-add -l
</pre>
</p><p>
As long as ssh-add can communicate with ssh-agent, you should see either
a list of your public keys or a message like &ldquo;The agent has no
identities&rdquo;.
</p><p>
If, for any reason, ssh-agent isn't running or your SSH_AUTH_SOCK
variable isn't set, or isn't set correctly, you will get the message
&ldquo;Could
not open a connection to your authentication agent&rdquo;.  In that case,
run the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   eval `ssh-agent`
</pre>
</p><p>
This starts an ssh-agent instance and automatically sets the environmental
variables in your current shell.
</p><p>
Next, create a key pair for root as you did in the first example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f key-rsa-root@machine2 -C "key-rsa-root@machine2"
</pre>
</p><p>
Move the private key to the removable media and give read access to the
owner but nobody else:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   mv key-rsa-root@machine2 /media/usbdisk
   chmod 400 /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-root@machine2
</pre>
</p><p>
Copy the public key into the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the
remote computer machine2.
</p><p>
Add root's private key on machine2 to ssh-agent by running the following
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh-add -t 300 /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-root@machine2
</pre>
</p><p>
Enter the passphrase when prompted, and ssh-agent returns the message
&ldquo;Identity added: key-rsa-root@machine2
(key-rsa-root@machine2)&rdquo; when
it adds the key.  (The -t 300 option limits the lifetime of the cache
to 300 seconds, or five minutes.  Your keys will remain viable forever if
you don't specify the lifetime.)
</p><p>
Log in to the remote machine as a regular user:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh -A -i /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-bob@machine2
</pre>
</p><p>
Enter the passphrase when prompted, and you will log in to machine2.  (This
command is the same as in Example 1, except we're using the -A option,
which turns on agent forwarding.)
</p><p>
Type <tt  >ssh-add -l</tt> on machine2, and you should see the root key you just
added to ssh-agent.  For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   2048 fa:5c:4b:73:88:26:..:... /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-root@machine2 (rsa)
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, <tt  >su</tt> to root (on machine2), and configure the
SSH d&aelig;mon
to allow root logins on the internal loopback interface.  Edit the
/etc/ssh/sshd_config file and add/modify the following options:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   PermitRootLogin yes
   AllowUsers bob@*
   AllowUsers root@localhost.*
</pre>
</p><p>
(Some OpenSSH configurations require you to set the numeric
loopback address explicitly: <tt  >AllowUsers
root@127.0.0.1</tt>.)
</p><p>
Save your changes, and restart the SSH d&aelig;mon:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   service sshd restart
</pre>
</p><p>
Log out of the root account, and use OpenSSH to log back in as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh root@localhost
</pre>
</p><p>
Now the OpenSSH d&aelig;mon on machine2 accepts root logins on the loopback
interface but not from the external network.  It negotiates with ssh-agent
on machine1 to authenticate you as the root user.  root's private key
never left machine1! Using OpenSSH in this way effectively allows you
to replace the su (switch user) and sudo utilities.
</p><p>
But, we're not quite finished.  You can increase security further by
limiting the su command to locally connected devices.  Modify /etc/pam.d/su
as shown below to prevent anyone from using su over the network:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   auth       required    pam_securetty.so
</pre>
</p><p>
The su command will work only from the console and virtual terminals.
</p><p>
Unmount and remove your USB device.  Individuals actually will have to steal your USB
drive at this point to get your keys.  Even then, they have to discover your
passphrase or expend lots of computing power and time cracking the key.

Example 3: Tightening Up</h2></div></div><p>
We need to close a potential vulnerability before using this system
in the wild.
</p><p>
Using ssh-agent and agent forwarding allows the remote SSH server to
query the private key stored on your local computer.  However, if you use
this system to log in to multiple computers, an intruder on one machine
can
potentially highjack those keys to break in to another machine.  In that
case, this system could be more dangerous than one using static passwords.
</p><p>
To illustrate the problem, let's expand our example network from two to
three nodes by adding machine3 to the mix.  Create key pairs for both bob
and root on machine3, as described in Examples 1 and 2, and add root's
private key to ssh-agent on machine1.
</p><p>
Now, <tt  >ssh</tt> to machine3 as bob using the agent-forwarding option -A.  Run
<tt  >ssh-add -l</tt>, and you can see the public keys for
both machine2 and machine3:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   2048 fa:5c:4b:73:88:...: ... /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-root@machine2 (RSA)
   2048 26:b6:e3:99:c1:...: ... /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-root@machine3 (RSA)
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, ssh-agent on machine1 caches the private keys for
machine2 and machine3.  This single agent allows us to log in as root on
either computer.  However, using the single agent also potentially allows an intruder
on machine2 to log in as root on machine3 and vice versa.  This
is not good.
</p><p>
Fortunately, we can fix this problem by using the ssh-add -c option; we
can add additional security by using individual ssh-agent instances to
store one root key for each remote machine.  The -c option tells ssh-agent
to have the user confirm each use of a cached key.  Devoting one ssh-agent
instance per host prevents any as yet unknown ssh-agent vulnerability
from
exposing one machine's key to another.
</p><p>Using the ssh-add confirm option is easy; simply set the -c option
whenever adding a key to ssh-agent.  Let's give it a try.  Start two agents
on machine1, specifiying predefined sockets:


<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh-add -c /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-root@machine2
   ssh-add -c /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-root@machine3
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll be asked to confirm use of the key when you
<tt  >ssh</tt> to machine2 and machine3.
</p><p>
You also can use separate ssh-agents to store each key.  Let's give it a
try; start two agents on machine1, specifying predefined sockets:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh-agent -a /tmp/ssh-agent-root@machine2
   ssh-agent -a /tmp/ssh-agent-root@machine3
</pre>
</p><p>
Once again, I'm using an arbitrary yet descriptive naming convention.  Set
the environmental variable, and add the key for machine2:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-agent-root@machine2
   ssh-add -c /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-root@machine2
</pre>
</p><p>
Repeat this process for machine3, making the appropriate substitutions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-agent-root@machine3
   ssh-add -c /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-root@machine3
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, log in to machine3 (we'll go to machine3 at this point as we just
set the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable to point to machine3's agent):

<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh -A -i /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-bob@machine2 bob@machine3
</pre>
</p><p>
Run the following command to see what keys you can query on machine1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh-add -l
</pre>
</p><p>
You see only the key for root on machine3.
</p><p>
Exit from machine3, change the environmental variable to the machine2
ssh-agent socket, and log in to machine2:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-agent-root@machine2
   ssh -A -i /media/usbdisk/key-rsa-bob@machine2 bob@machine2
</pre>
</p><p>
Check your keys again:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   ssh-add -l
</pre>
</p><p>
Checking your keys on machine2 and machine3 reveals only the root key for
that machine.  In the previous example, by using a single ssh-agent,
you would have seen the keys for both machine2 and machine3.
</p><p>
Using separate ssh-agent instances for each machine you log in to requires
more work.
</p><p>
Resetting the SSH_AUTH_SOCK variable every time you want to log in to
another machine is impractical.  To simplify the process, I've written
a simple script tfssh (two-factor ssh) to simplify the process.  Its
syntax is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   tfssh [username@]host [keydir]
</pre>
</p><p>
The script [Listing 1 on the <i  >LJ</i> FTP site at <a href="../listings/152/8957.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue152/8957.tgz</a>] starts ssh-agent when necessary, sets
the environmental variable, adds the root keys to ssh-agent and logs
in to the remote machine as the user.  You also can tell tfssh to look in
an arbitrary directory ([keydir]) for its keys and also set a key
timeout for the key cache.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1511e28"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>ssh-add</b></p><p>
ssh-add allows you to lock and/or confirm using private keys.  Use the -x
and -X options to lock and unlock a key.  You will create a password to lock
the key, and use the password to unlock it.  Using the -c option directs
ssh-add to prompt you every time ssh-agent is asked to use a key.  The
prompt is displayed on the machine running ssh-agent and effectively
prevents unauthorized users from using your keys.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1511fe0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Static passwords are quickly becoming more trouble than they're
worth.  We need to break the static habit and start using two-factor
authentication.  OpenSSH is a powerful system that provides the
tools necessary to make that step.  By using public/private keys,
agent forwarding and removable media, we can use OpenSSH as a key
&ldquo;safe&rdquo;.  This, in turn, allows us to create a simple, inexpensive and
effective host-based, two-factor authentication system.
</p><p>
This two-factor system requires a moderate amount of work to
configure and use, but it is well worth the extra security.  However, using
the tfssh script makes the process easy to use.  Using the script means
you get all the benefits of two-factor authentication but almost none of the hassle.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101f580.0x1512198"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Two vs. 2.X Factors</b></p><p>
Some people count the locally stored SSH keys and their passphrases
as two factors.  This view is reasonable, but I feel more comfortable
physically separating the key storage device from the computer.  Keeping
your keys on removable media reduces the opportunity for intruders to
capture and crack them.
</p><p>
Now, it's important to realize that keeping your keys on devices like USB
pendrives doesn't eliminate the ability of an intruder to spy them.  Your
keys are vulnerable while mounted, and you should take precautions to
harden the workstation from which you connect to other computers.  Use good
passwords for local (console) logins, keep your workstation patched and
so on.
</p><p>
So, you're better off using public key authentication than static
passwords, as long as you adequately protect your workstation.  How safe you
want to be depends on your paranoia.

You can store your keys on any type of removable media.  I'm using a USB
pendrive in these examples because it's easy to work with and carry
around.  Feel free to use writable CD-ROMs or DVDs or even floppies if
you want.
