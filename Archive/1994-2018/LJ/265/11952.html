Learn the basics of Linux by building your own private multi-server
&ldquo;Internet&rdquo;.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2588580.0x26802a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As readers of this magazine well know, Linux drives many of the
technologies we use every day, from smart TVs to Web servers. Linux is
everywhere&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>except</em></span> most homes and classrooms.
</p><p>
That's a problem if we want to help breed the next generation of engineers
and computer scientists. In fact, if teenagers (or any other group of
curious individuals) want to learn about Linux, they often must rely on
a geeky friend or parent willing to show them the way.
</p><p>
This three-part series seeks to change that by offering a way for
anyone to learn about Linux by building what is essentially a tiny,
self-contained Internet. Using old equipment and free software, you'll
build a private network (with your own domain name), build Web sites,
set up an e-mail server, install and use a database, and set up a Linux
distro mirror.
</p><p>
If you like to learn by doing, but you're intimidated by the thick Linux
texts you find at the bookstore, this Tiny Internet Project is for
you. If you're a teacher interested in bringing Linux to the classroom,
this is a great way to do it.
</p><p>
At the core of the project is a Proxmox KVM environment. KVM, or
kernel-based virtual machine, is an open-source alternative to often
costly VM technology like VMware and Hyper-V. You'll use Proxmox to host
several Ubuntu 14.04 servers (or other Linux flavors), connect them over
a private network and learn a lot about Linux along the way.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11952f1.large.jpg"><img src="11952f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Proxmox
</p></div></div><p>
The Tiny Internet Project assumes you have some basic computer skills
(Windows, Mac or Linux), that you have a couple computers lying around
and that you have some time to tinker. The project can be done in whole
or in part, depending on your interests and needs. It's particularly
designed for educators who want to introduce school-aged kids to Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2588580.0x2680880"></a>
What You'll Be Building</h2></div></div><p>
You'll be using open-source software for everything in this project,
so everything you need will be free to download and use. You'll also
take advantage of virtualization technology, which will enable you to
deploy a bunch of virtual machines. In all, you'll deploy:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The Proxmox server to host all your virtual machines.
</p></li><li><p>
Two DNS servers, a primary and a secondary.
</p></li><li><p>
An e-mail server.
</p></li><li><p>
One or more Web servers.
</p></li><li><p>
An Ubuntu 14.04 repository mirror.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Strictly speaking, the mirror is optional. As long as you have an Internet
connection, you'll be able to download new software and run Linux updates
on all the servers you deploy. But the goal is to create a self-contained
tiny Internet that will work without a permanent connection to the public
Internet. Setting up a local mirror will enable you to do just that.
</p><p>
Optionally, you can build two or more Proxmox hosts and set up a
cluster (I'll cover that when I describe building the Proxmox server). Obviously,
you'll need one physical computer for each Proxmox host you want to add
to your tiny Internet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2588580.0x2680e00"></a>
Project Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
When it comes to hardware for this project, the goal is not to have
you buy anything new, but to use stuff you already own&mdash;maybe your
recently retired desktop, an old wireless router or an old laptop or
netbook. If you don't have any hardware like this lying around, ask
friends and family, and then consider Craigslist or eBay.
</p><p>
The bare minimum hardware you'll need includes: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
One 64-bit PC that supports virtualization.
</p></li><li><p>
One PC that can attach to a network and run a Web browser (Windows, Mac or
Linux).
</p></li><li><p>
One network switch or router.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Nice to have: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Another 64-bit PC that supports virtualization so you can build a cluster.
</p></li><li><p>
Some sort of network-attached storage (NAS).
</p></li><li><p>
Another old PC that can run Linux to act as a proxy server.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2588580.0x2681488"></a>
Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>The Main Server:</b></span>
</p><p>
The key requirement for this project is a primary computer with a
processor that can handle virtualization. Many, many computers made
since 2010 or so have this capability, including the tower I used for
my very first tiny Internet. It has:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
One Intel i3 processor (four cores).
</p></li><li><p>
8GB of memory (possible with less, but not much less).
</p></li><li><p>
Two 2TB SATA drives (one drive is enough).
</p></li><li><p>
Two 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports (it had one built in to the motherboard, and I
added a PCI card).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
To see if the computer you have in mind can become a Proxmox server, there
are several ways to test it to see if it supports virtualization. There
are tools for Windows and Linux, which are listed in the Resources
section at the end of this article.
</p><p>
For those already using a Linux desktop or server, you can use existing
commands to see if virtualization is supported. Open a terminal and run
this simple command to do a quick check:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep vmx
</pre>
</p><p>
It should return something that looks like the following (repeated
several times for each core you have):

<pre     class="programlisting">
[flags    : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr 
 &#8618;pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse 
 &#8618;sse2 ss ht tm pbe syscall nx rdtscp lm constant_tsc 
 &#8618;arch_perfmon pebs bts rep_good nopl xtopology nonstop_tsc 
 &#8618;aperfmperf eagerfpu pni pclmulqdq dtes64 monitor ds_cpl 
 &#8618;vmx smx est tm2 ssse3 cx16 xtpr pdcm pcid sse4_1 
 &#8618;sse4_2 x2apic popcnt tsc_deadline_timer aes xsave avx f16c 
 &#8618;rdrand lahf_lm ida arat epb xsaveopt pln pts dtherm 
 &#8618;tpr_shadow vnmi flexpriority ept vpid fsgsbase smep erms]
</pre>
</p><p>
If the flags include <tt  >vmx</tt> (possibly highlighted red in the output), you're
probably good to go. You also might check your system's BIOS. Often,
virtualization is possible, but it's disabled by default. Look for it
in your BIOS, enable it and reboot.
</p><p>
If you have additional hard drives that you'd like to use
with this project, you can install them in your main server (the Proxmox
host machine). Technically speaking, you need only a single drive, but
having more than one can give you nice options for backing up the things
you build. It's also good practice to learn how to mount multiple drives!
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
The Administration PC:</b></span>
</p><p>
You'll need some sort of second computer to act as your main
administrative machine. This does not need to support virtualization. It
only needs to be able to run a Web browser, maybe tinyproxy, and have an
Ethernet port and Wi-Fi&mdash;or two Ethernet ports. If the machine doesn't
have built-in Wi-Fi, you can get a USB dongle to do the job. The goal
here is to have a machine with two network connections: one to your
Tiny Internet and one to the network you use to access the Internet,
such as your home or school network.
</p><p>
The administration PC can be your current desktop or laptop, and it can
be Windows, Mac or Linux. If you're planning to have a main Proxmox
server with two Ethernet ports, your administration PC needs to
have only two network connections if you want to connect to
your private tiny Internet and the public Internet simultaneously. One scenario also
uses this PC as an http proxy server, which again needs access to both
public and private networks.
</p><p>
I had a couple old laptops, and I successfully used the
following for my administration PC:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
An IBM ThinkPad T60p (with built-in Wi-Fi and 10/100/1000 wired Ethernet).
</p></li><li><p>
A Dell Mini 9 (with built-in Wi-Fi and 10/100 wired Ethernet).
</p></li><li><p>
A Dell Mini 10 (with built-in Wi-Fi and 10/100 wired Ethernet).
</p></li><li><p>
A first-generation Intel-based MacBook (with built-in Wi-Fi and -10/100/1000
wired Ethernet).
</p></li><li><p>
A Dell GX620 (with a Wi-Fi card and built-in 10/100 wired Ethernet).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Any old tower PC or desktop will work too&mdash;nothing fancy needed! 
</p><p>
Ideally, your administration PC will be running a flavor of Linux
with a desktop environment like GNOME, KDE or Xfce. However, it's not
necessary. The goal is to ease you into Linux, not to toss you
into the pool cruelly.
</p><p>
Optional: if it's not possible to run dedicated Linux computers in your
classroom (or lab), but you want to get a taste for it, you always
can boot a Windows or Intel-based Mac using a USB stick. I'll go into more
detail about this later, but you can learn more about making a bootable
USB with Linux on the Ubuntu Web site. Information is available in the
Resources section at the end of this article.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Other PCs for Your Tiny Internet:</b></span>
</p><p>
If you're running this project out of your den, you won't need any more
computers. If you're building this in a classroom, the student machines
can be much like the administration PC, though they each need just one
network interface. If you're hard-wiring everyone to your tiny Internet,
obviously each PC will need an Ethernet port. If you're going wireless,
built-in Wi-Fi or inexpensive USB Wi-Fi dongles work great. Ideally,
all the PCs in your network will be running a flavor of Linux, such as
Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora, SUSE, CentOS, Kali&mdash;or another.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Network Gear:</b></span>
</p><p>
Again, you can use any switch or router you already have to create
your private tiny Internet network. A single network switch or router
is all you'll need to connect everything. If you already have a home
network router, that can double as your tiny Internet switch, but I
recommend a second to create a truly standalone system.
</p><p>
If you're setting up in a classroom, I strongly recommend using a
wireless router so you easily can add dozens and dozens of separate
student computers to your tiny Internet without running a bunch of
Ethernet cables all over the place. Sure, that'll look cool, but it's
not very practical.
</p><p>
Your tiny Internet switch (or router) requires just two ports:
one connected to your main Proxmox server and one connected to your
administration PC.
</p><p>
For my first tiny Internet, I used an old Netgear MR314 Wireless Router,
which features the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Four 10/100 LAN ports.
</p></li><li><p>
One 10/100 WAN port.
</p></li><li><p>
802.11b wireless.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Granted, this old box supports only WEP encryption, but it worked
fine. Remember, your tiny Internet is self-contained, with no direct
connection to the outside world. Yes, you'll want some security in place,
but your main security risk is from members of your own tiny Internet,
not the world.
</p><p>
I also tested the following networking devices with success: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A TP-Link TL-SG108 eight-port 100/1000 switch (bought new for $25).
</p></li><li><p>
A Netgear N600 four-port 10/100 Wireless Dual-Band Router WNDR3400.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11952f2.large.jpg"><img src="11952f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Netgear 
</p></div></div><p>
The Netgear N600 became my final choice because it has WPA2 security,
wireless n capability and a USB 3.0 port for adding a USB drive (for
making a poor man's NAS).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Other Hardware:</b></span>
</p><p>
In addition to the PCs and network gear, you'll need a few USB thumbdrives. You'll burn .iso images to these and set them up so you can boot
from them. In particular, you'll create these three:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Proxmox 4.x boot disk.
</p></li><li><p>
Ubuntu 14.04 server boot disk.
</p></li><li><p>
Xubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr (or any other Linux-flavor desktop you want).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you don't have access to USB thumbdrives, you always can use DVDs for
the purpose, but that's not nearly as easy, flexible or cheap. Still,
if that's all you have, make sure you have four or five blank disks
available, a decent DVD burner and disk-burning software.
</p><p>
Wireless capability is fairly ubiquitous in modern PCs and laptops, but
your older machines may not have it. Fortunately, there are dozens of very
inexpensive USB Wi-Fi dongles available (many for $8 or so). If you're
thinking of getting one (or a dozen), make sure the device works under
Linux. Better still: buy devices that work with Linux, Windows or Mac.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2588580.0x26799a0"></a>
Software</h2></div></div><p>
All the software you'll use for the Tiny Internet Project is free and
open-source. Most of it's Linux software, of course, but I've also listed
a few tools for Windows and Mac users, particularly the software you'll
need to create bootable USB drives from an .iso file.
</p><p>
You'll notice too that I'm using Ubuntu 14.04 as the base for my
virtual machines. If you would rather use, say, Fedora or SUSE, that's
up to you. For brevity, I stick to Ubuntu when it comes time to talk
about installation procedures.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Proxmox 4.x:</b></span>
</p><p>
Proxmox is an open-source KVM, or kernel-based virtual machine host. You
can use many different flavors of Linux to create a KVM, but Proxmox is a
good option for your tiny Internet because it comes complete. It's based
on Debian, which is similar to the Ubuntu 14.04 you'll be installing,
and it features an excellent browser-based management tool. It's also nice
that you can install a system in minutes using the Proxmox .iso,
which you'll turn into a bootable USB disk.
</p><p>
It's important to note that Proxmox is free to use, but offers several
paid levels of support. If you want to purchase those services, that's
up to you. You won't need to purchase anything for this project though.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:</b></span>
</p><p>
The long-term release of Ubuntu 14.04 (also known as Trusty Tahr) is
solid, stable, flexible and makes a great foundation for all your virtual
machines. Let's download and install the 64-bit version, which you'll
use to build your virtual machines and VM templates. The operating system
also is available in a 32-bit version, which means you can install the
same operating system on all your tiny Internet computers and servers&mdash;even if some of your equipment is older. When I set up my Dell Mini
9 as a proxy server, for example, I used the 32-bit Ubuntu 14.04 for
seamless integration.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11952f3.large.jpg"><img src="11952f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Ubuntu Server
</p></div></div><p>
You'll make a bootable USB drive from the latest Ubuntu 14.04 .iso;
if you're going the DVD route, you'll create a bootable disk.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Webmin 1.7x:</b></span>
Webmin is a browser-based tool that makes administering (and
understanding) a Linux server a lot easier. Hard-core command-line junkies
will scoff at the GUI, but those new to Linux will appreciate
Webmin's power and flexibility for managing everything from Apache
Web services and Postfix-related mail services to updates and system
health. You'll install Webmin on your base Ubuntu 14.04 VM template and
use it on every server thereafter.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11952f4.large.jpg"><img src="11952f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Webmin
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>apt-mirror:</b></span>
</p><p>
The goal of the Tiny Internet Project is to build a standalone Internet,
and in order to do that, you need to make all the Linux software you want
(and might dream of using) available on your private network. To do that,
you'll install apt-mirror on one of your Ubuntu VMs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11952f5.large.jpg"><img src="11952f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. apt-mirror
</p></div></div><p>
To replicate the Ubuntu Trusty Tahr Linux distribution, you'll need
much more disk space than all your other virtual servers combined. I've
done several tests using standard apt-mirror settings (without -src, or
source versions), and I found that the main, security and i386 repositories
total less than 100GB. When you build the mirror VM, you'll make a 200GB disk, which should give you enough space for future additions and
natural growth of the repository.
</p><p>
Once your local mirror is built, Ubuntu updates and upgrade will be
very fast. However, initially downloading the mirror will take hours&mdash;even
over fast Internet connections. Once it's done though, future
updates go quickly and you'll have everything you need to build out and
experiment with a variety of VM servers.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Bind9:</b></span>
</p><p>
In order to make your tiny Internet as real as possible, you'll set up
a domain name server (DNS) that will allow you to give your private
network a working domain. Bind9 is the latest version of bind, which
allows you to set up forward and reverse zones. That means if you want
to run a domain called linuxrocks.com, you can, and create subdomains
like dns.linuxrocks.com or mirror01.linuxrocks.com. This also will make
setting up your private e-mail system a lot easier and much more familiar.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Postfix and Dovecot:</b></span>
</p><p>
A big part of the public Internet is e-mail, and your tiny Internet would
come up short if it didn't provide this important service. You'll use
Postfix for mail handling and Dovecot for POP-ing or IMAP-ing the mail
to e-mail clients like Thunderbird. Not only will users of your private
tiny Internet be able to have their own e-mail addresses, but they'll also be
able to exchange e-mail freely with one another.
</p><p>
These mail services are solid and reliable, and they're supported by a
wide array of e-mail clients, including Thunderbird. You'll experiment with
securing the mail server too, so you can learn more about mail security.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LAMP Stack:</b></span>
</p><p>
The combination of Linux, Apache (Web), MySQL (database) and PHP form
the foundation for millions of servers around the world and across
the Internet. The combination enables a wide array of Web sites (and
content-management systems), database-driven Web applications and much
more. You'll deploy a &ldquo;base&rdquo; LAMP stack on one of your Ubuntu 14.04
VMs and then make a template of it. That way, you'll be able to deploy
as many different Web servers as you want.
</p><p>
The base LAMP VM will include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Apache2.
</p></li><li><p>
MySQL.
</p></li><li><p>
PHP 5.x.
</p></li><li><p>
phpMyAdmin.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The last item, phpMyAdmin, is a popular browser-based tool for
managing MySQL databases. It's robust and flexible, and perfect for
learning more about databases.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Tinyproxy:</b></span>
</p><p>
You have a couple options when it comes to connecting your private tiny
Internet to the public Internet. One is to have multiple network cards
in your main Proxmox host. The other is to have a secondary computer with
two network connections to serve as a proxy server. There are advantages
to each, so you can decide later which way you want to proceed.
</p><p>
If you take the proxy path&mdash;using a separate computer to relay all
your http, https and ftp requests&mdash;you'll install tinyproxy. It's very
lightweight, doesn't require caching (which can take up massive amounts
of disk space), and it's fast. You'll have to make some modifications
to apt to enable Ubuntu updates via the proxy, but once it's set up,
it works well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DHCP:</b></span>
</p><p>
If you've played with a home network&mdash;a router provided by your Internet
provider, for example&mdash;you're probably familiar with how DHCP works. A
DHCP server hands out IP addresses to all the devices that attach to the
network, whether they're computers, tablets, smartphones or thermostats.
</p><p>
If you're deploying a large tiny Internet&mdash;say, in a classroom&mdash;having DHCP will make things easy. Yes, you can assign static IP addresses
to all the machines on your private network (and some servers, indeed,
must have static addresses), but for casual users, DHCP works great.
</p><p>
If you're using a router (such as the Netgear models I mentioned earlier),
it probably has its own DHCP server built in. That means the device
itself hands out IP addresses to every wired and wireless connection it
makes, so all your computers, tablets and smartphones have their own
unique addresses. Plug in the router, connect it to your tiny Internet,
and you're done.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>isc-dhcp-server:</b></span>
</p><p>
If instead you're planning to use a simple network switch (one that
doesn't hand out addresses at all), you'll need to deploy a DHCP
server. Here, you'll use isc-dhcp-server for the job. It's lightweight and
easy to use. Even if you plan to use a router with built-in DHCP, you
may want to deploy a separate isc-dhcp-server as a back-up (I'll talk
about how to do that later in this series).
</p><p>
Part of the fun of running your own tiny Internet is having complete
control over all the pieces&mdash;the servers, the client PCs and the
network. By installing a simple tool like iperf, you'll be able to test
the speeds at which your components communicate. If you've ever used
on-line tools like Speedtest.net to test your home or workplace Internet
download and upload speeds, you'll be familiar with what iperf does.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11952f6.large.jpg"><img src="11952f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. iperf
</p></div></div><p>
You'll use iperf to test the speeds between devices across your private
network and to test speeds between servers living together on the Proxmox
host. This is where it really gets interesting. Even if you're using a
10Mb Ethernet switch to connect your VM host machine with your laptop,
for example, you'll be able to measure gigabit speeds between your
various VMs. That's because they're connected by a virtual network on
a single server, limited only by the speed of the server's bus! That'll
make your tiny Internet a speedy and realistic place to explore Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2588580.0x298d6e8"></a>Coming Next</h2></div></div><p>
In the next installments, you'll take the information I've covered here
