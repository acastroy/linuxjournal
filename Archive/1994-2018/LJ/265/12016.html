The Qt Company's Qt Start-Up</h2></div></div><p>
The Qt Company is proud to offer a new version of the Qt for Application
Development package called Qt Start-Up, the company's C++-based framework
of libraries and tools that enables the development of powerful, interactive and
cross-platform applications and devices. Now used by around one million developers
worldwide, the Qt Company seeks to expand its user base by targeting smaller
enterprises. The new Qt Start-Up, available to companies with an annual revenue
of less than $100,000, enables small and start-up companies to harness the full
power of the Qt application and UI development framework in their products. The
Qt Start-Up package is just as powerful as the regular Qt for Application
Development package, but it's available at a much lower price. The Qt Company's
rationale for Qt Start-Up is to enable a new generation of innovators and help
them build successful businesses assisted by the powerful application
development and UI creation tools within the Qt framework.

Linaro's ARM-Based Developer Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
As the adoption of ARM-based servers accelerates and IoT applications rapidly
evolve, software developers are demanding access to requisite hardware and
software-reference platforms. In response, Linaro released Linaro Developer
Cloud, a new cloud-based native ARMv8 development
environment, which can be used to design, develop, port and test server, cloud
and IoT applications without substantial upfront hardware investment. The
Developer Cloud is the combination of ARM-based silicon vendors' server
hardware platforms, emerging cloud technologies and many
Linaro member-driven projects, including server-class boot architecture, kernel
and virtualization. The Developer Cloud is based on OpenStack, leveraging both
Debian and CentOS, as the underlying cloud OS infrastructure. It will use
ARM-based server platforms from Linaro members AMD, Cavium, Huawei and Qualcomm
Technologies, Inc., and will expand with demand and as new server platforms come
to market.

Ben Rady's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Serverless Single Page Apps</em></span> (The Pragmatic Programmers)</h2></div></div><p>
You don't need to manage your own servers to build powerful Web
applications. Need proof? Pick up tech author Ben Rady's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Serverless
Single Page Apps: Fast, Scalable, and Available</em></span>, a guide to creating single-page
apps that run entirely on Web services, scale to millions of users and cost
amazingly little. Readers of Rady's book will skip over building an
application server, avoid messing around with middle-tier infrastructure and get
right to the Web app their customers want. Using a Web browser, a prepared
workspace and an editor, readers learn the fundamental technologies behind
modern single-page apps and use Web standards to create lean Web applications
that can take advantage of the newest technologies. They'll also deploy the
application quickly using Amazon S3 and utilize Amazon Cognito to connect with
providers like Google and Facebook to manage user identities. Other topics
include DynamoDB for reading and writing user data directly from the browser and
Amazon Lambda for creation of scalable custom microservices. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Serverless Single
Page Apps</em></span> is for those who either have never built a Web application before and
seasoned Web developers looking for an alternative to complex server-side Web
frameworks.

Varnish Software's Varnish Massive Storage Engine</h2></div></div><p>
The headlining feature of the new Varnish Massive Storage Engine (MSE) 2.0 from
Varnish Software is cache persistence. This new capability in MSE, an exclusive
module of Varnish Plus Web optimization suite, allows Web sites to retain data
across restarts and reboots and ensures that, in the case of a system crash,
cache content will not be lost. Furthermore, users can repair and maintain their
sites as quickly as possible. Varnish MSE was designed specifically for the
high-performance needs of video distribution, content delivery networks (CDNs)
and large-cache use cases that require enabling of the Varnish caching layer to
handle multi-terabyte data sets. For big CDNs, an empty cache is a no-go, argues
Varnish, and reintroducing large cache objects, of the size for which MSE is
required, is time-consuming and expensive. With Varnish MSE 2.0, all objects
remain in cache with minimal performance reduction.

PeaZip</h2></div></div><p>
Free of charge for any use and free of any kind of advertising bundle, PeaZip is
an open-source (LGPL) file archiver, a free alternative to software like WinRar
and WinZip, for Linux and Windows. Version 6.0.0 is a new major release of
PeaZip that adds new features to the existing functionality. Innovations include
ability to open/extract in the new RAR5 format, full support for Unicode
filenames, quick search and new themes to customize PeaZip's look and feel.
PeaZip now supports more than 180 archive types (including 7Z, RAR, TAR, ZIP,
ZIPX and so on)
and provides useful file management features, such as encryption, file
split, verify hash and secure delete. PeaZip adds that, unlike most other
classic file archivers like WinZip and WinRar, its archiver is natively
portable and cross-platform/multiplatform software that is available for
computers or tablets running 32-bit and 64-bit Windows (9x, NT/2K/XP,
Vista/7/8/10, ReactOS, Wine), Linux or BSD x86 and x86-64.

Petros Koutoupis' RapidDisk</h2></div></div><p>
RapidDisk is an open-source and enhanced Linux RAM drive solution led by BDFL
Petros Koutoupis that allows users to create, resize and remove RAM
drives dynamically or map those same RAM drives as a cache to slower data volumes. The
latest version 4.0 release adds a series of complementary improvements, such as
kernel module optimizations, code cleanup/redesign and bug fixes. RapidDisk
consists of a collection of kernel modules, an administration utility,
high-availability scripts and a RESTful API for third-party integration. By
design, RapidDisk volumes are thinly provisioned and will allocate memory
only upon usage.

ServersCheck's Thermal Imaging Camera Sensor</h2></div></div><p>
Monitoring data centers with sensors over conventional temperature probes has
huge advantages, says facilities monitoring specialist ServersCheck. The
company's new technology is what it bills as &ldquo;the world's first thermal
imaging camera sensor that works with SNMP and Modbus&rdquo;. While a traditional
temperature sensor reports the nearby temperature, ServersCheck's
patent-pending thermal imaging sensor performs a thermal scan of what it sees
within its 50&deg; field-of-view camera. Every two seconds, it checks the temperature
at 4,800 points, and this thermal image array is then converted into SNMP and
Modbus data for easy integration with monitoring platforms. The network
monitoring or building management platform receives transmission from the wired
or cellular base unit&mdash;that is, the SensorGateway, which connects to the sensors via
RJ45. This new technology opens up myriad new monitoring opportunities, says
ServersCheck, particularly relating to data centers and distributed
infrastructure sites. The new sensors can monitor individual changes or events
within the environment that don't necessarily affect the overall conditions
and often go undetected. Furthermore, monitoring the contacts and switches at
substations with massive current loads on a 24x7 basis streamlines the
maintenance process and safeguards against massive failures.

Chris Birchall's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Re-Engineering Legacy Software</em></span> (Manning Publications)</h2></div></div><p>
Chances are high that you didn't write the application you're currently working
on. Most developers inherit projects built on an existing codebase that reflects
design patterns, usage assumptions, infrastructure and tooling from another
time and another team (and the docs are complete rubbish). To help you breathe
new life into your legacy project, pick up Chris Birchall's new book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Re-Engineering Legacy Software</em></span>. Birchall's book is an experience-driven
guide to revitalizing inherited projects, covering refactoring, quality metrics,
toolchain and workflow, continuous integration, infrastructure automation and
organizational culture. On the purely technical side, readers will learn
techniques for introducing dependency injection for code modularity,
quantitatively measuring quality and automating infrastructure. On the
strategic side, readers will develop practical processes for deciding whether to
rewrite or refactor, team organization and even convincing management that
quality matters. Core topics include deciphering and modularizing awkward code
structures, effectively integrating and automating tests, replacing an outdated
build system and infrastructure automation using tools like Vagrant and
Ansible.
