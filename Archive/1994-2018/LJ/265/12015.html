<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #265, May 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Michal Hocko</b></span> has submitted some code to rework the detection of
<span   class="bold"><b>out-of-memory conditions</b></span>. Earlier versions were
&ldquo;requests for
comments&rdquo;, but with no major objections, Michal now is asking that the
code be added to <span   class="bold"><b>linux-next</b></span> to widen its testing base.
</p><p>
The current patch was just an incremental update, but Michal said that
the goal of the larger project:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...is an attempt to make the OOM
detection more deterministic and easier to follow because each
reclaimer basically tracks its own progress which is implemented at
the page allocator layer rather [than] spread out between the
allocator and the reclaim.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
He asked folks to come up with new testing scenarios, because the OOM
killer is notoriously hard to get right. Ideally, it works properly
under &ldquo;standard load&rdquo;, but how can there be a standard load when Linux
is used throughout the world for every conceivable purpose?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Hugh Dickins</b></span> reported a problem with the new
code: it would kill his
<span   class="bold"><b>TmpFS</b></span> instance during heavy swap, whereas the old OOM killer would let
it run forever. But, he did acknowledge that &ldquo;tmpfs is and always has
been a problem for OOM-killing, given that it takes up memory.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Various other folks posted the results of their tests as well, mostly
showing success, though there were some long discussions of particular
technical details and a bunch of code revisions as Michal addressed
people's concerns.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Balbir Singh</b></span> posted patches to allow updating a running Linux kernel
on <span   class="bold"><b>PowerPC</b></span>. This kind of
&ldquo;live patching&rdquo; is one of the holy grails of
operating system development. In order to do it, you have to transfer
all the running infrastructure from the existing kernel to the new
one. This involves changing stored memory locations, replacing
functions at the proper time and other strange things, all of which
must be done individually. It's the kind of feature that, before it
was possible, people said never would work. Even now, <span   class="bold"><b>Torsten Duwe</b></span>
replied to Balbir's post, saying, &ldquo;Have you <span   class="emphasis"><em>tested</em></span> this patch?
Replacing a function in the kernel? Replacing a function in a module?
For local calls? For global calls? I strongly doubt so because it does
not work this way.&rdquo;
</p><p>
In fact, Torsten wasn't saying that the whole thing didn't work that
way, only that the particular approach was problematic and needed
further discussion. Meanwhile, <span   class="bold"><b>Petr Mladek</b></span> tested the patch and
reported failure. He described the test results as, &ldquo;!!! KABOOM
!!!&rdquo;
Balbir replied, &ldquo;Very good test case&rdquo;, and proceeded to investigate
fixes.
</p><p>
After some further effort, Balbir said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The previous revision was
nacked by Torsten, but compared to the alternatives at hand I think we
should test this approach. Ideally we want all the complexity of
live-patching in the live-patching code and not in the [user's] patch.
The other option is to accept v4 and document the limitation to patch
writers of not patching functions [that have more than] 8 arguments.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
He posted a new patch, which Torsten nacked again, saying, &ldquo;I nacked
it because I was confident it couldn't work. Same goes for this one,
sorry. My good intention was to save us all some work.&rdquo; Commenting on
some of the technical problems, he added, &ldquo;Using heuristics to
determine whether the call was local or global makes me feel highly
uncomfortable; one day it will break and nobody will remember why.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Referring to Balbir's earlier comment, <span   class="bold"><b>Michael
Ellerman</b></span> said it was
unlikely that anyone would want to live patch a function with more than
eight arguments, but he added:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
With the current proposals, we have no
way of preventing them from doing so. Which means the first sign
they'll get that it doesn't work is when they've applied the patch and
their production system goes down. And not even when they insert the
patch, only when the patched function is called, possibly some time
later.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
He also remarked, &ldquo;perhaps in reality most people are only
applying live patches from their distro, in which case the distro
should have tested it. But I don't know for sure.&rdquo;
</p><p>
And in spite of these remaining problems, Michael added that he wanted
to see these patches go into the kernel and continue testing and
developing. He said, &ldquo;I think we can probably come up with a fully
robust solution. But not tonight, and not this week.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Throughout all of this, Balbir affirmed that there were plenty of
problems to solve. He said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I've been working with the constraints we
have to get a solution that does not put the burden on the patch
writer. That is why this is marked experimental as it needs a lot of
testing. I think we should mark live patching on PPC as experimental to
begin with.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And added, &ldquo;I am keen on getting live-patching working. I
think v4 with the documented limitation is fine.&rdquo;
</p><p>
And, the quest for the grail continues. Everyone involved in this
discussion, in spite of their sometimes dire predictions and warnings,
were all enthusiastic to get some form of this code into the kernel,
even with the heavy set of caveats that currently exist. One day,
live patching on PowerPC will just be normal, but for now, it remains
the insane upside-down province of these lunatic visionaries.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Snapchat, for Hoarders!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #265, May 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I like Snapchat, but if I'm being totally honest, it's not something
I use every day. I like it because my kids send me goofy pictures and
videos, and it makes me happy that they think to include me in their
Snapchatty world.
</p><p>
The thing is, Snapchat is designed with the notion that photos and videos
should be ephemeral, and once they're viewed, they disappear. I don't
share that particular sentiment, and I tend to err the other way. Namely,
I not only keep photos and videos, but I also generally back them up in three
different places, geographically separated in case of failure. Also,
I'm old, and I forget things.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12015androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12015androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
(Photo from <a href="http://casper.io" target="_self">casper.io</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
Thankfully, there's a non-official Snapchat client made for folks like
me. It's called Casper (<a href="http://casper.io" target="_self">casper.io</a>), and it's not available in the
Google Play store. Installing it is fairly simple, but because it allows
you to save photos and videos, it's not allowed to be distributed in
the Play store. Also, I'm sure the folks at Snapchat don't really like
the app, since it goes against one of the app's core &ldquo;features&rdquo;, but if
you're okay with all those issues, I highly recommend it. The app is free,
and you can use it as your Snapchat client, even if you don't intend
to save the photos or videos your kids send you. But, if your kids are as
interesting as mine, you'll probably want to!

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Chrome, for One</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #265, May 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When I use OS X, I really like the Fluid app for making standalone Web
applications. The problem is, Fluid isn't free unless you want the basic
version. I don't mind paying for an application (and I did pay for Fluid),
but it seems like something as simple as a single site browser shouldn't
be something that costs money.
</p><p>
Thankfully, the folks at Epichrome feel the same way. They've created an
open-source project at <a href="https://github.com/dmarmor/epichrome" target="_self">https://github.com/dmarmor/epichrome</a> that allows
you to create standalone OS X applications that use Chrome in order to
provide a single site browser.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12015fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="12015fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
You can customize the way the app looks, give it a custom app icon and
even register it as a browser on the system, so you can have it open when
clicking on a specific Web site from inside your Web browser. I personally
use it for my BirdCam, but it's a great way to turn any Web site into an
&ldquo;app&rdquo; that you can launch from your dock.

<h2 class="title">Glass Padding?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #265, May 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When it comes to covering my cell phone, I tend toward minimalism. I like
to buy the smallest (although still powerful) phone possible, so the thought
of adding a bulky case seems wrong. I also don't like screen protectors,
because they generally get cloudy, and they don't feel as nice when using
the screen. That said, I still usually buy them, because I've forgotten
about my phone when getting out of the car and dropped it screen first
on gravel far too many times.
</p><p>
While ordering a screen protector after damaging mine on pavement
recently, I noticed that &ldquo;glass&rdquo; screen protectors are becoming quite
popular. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Glass</em></span>. To protect the glass. Isn't that like making a helmet
out of eggshells? The notion of protecting a glass screen with more
glass just seems absurd. And yet, the screen &ldquo;protectors&rdquo; get great
reviews. So I tried one.
</p><p>
First off, even with the thinnest tempered glass screen protector, they
are noticeably thicker than plastic film-based protectors. They're also a
little more challenging to apply. The truth is, however, that even with
the extra thickness, a tempered glass screen protector is amazing to
use! The screen is just as responsive, the surface feels just like glass
(duh!), and it doesn't get cloudy with regular use. In fact, it's by far
the best &ldquo;covered screen&rdquo; experience I've ever had on a cell phone. But
still, it's a piece of glass adhered to a piece of glass. I'm not sure
how that is really protection.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12015glassf1.large.jpg"><img src="12015glassf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Except that apparently it is. I've gone through two tempered glass screen
protectors in the past few months. Both times I dropped the phone,
it landed right on the glass, and both times it was on rough gravel. The
first time, the screen protector completely shattered. The second time
it cracked, but didn't shatter. Both times, the glass underneath wasn't
harmed even a little.
</p><p>
I'll be honest, I don't understand the physics behind protecting a layer
of glass with another layer of glass. Somehow it seems to work though. If
you wrapped an egg in a second eggshell, I don't think it would endure
a fall to the ground, but the glass screen protector apparently uses
physics in ways I don't comprehend. And for that reason, I'm giving
&ldquo;tempered glass screen protectors&rdquo; this month's Editors' Choice Award. If
you've been hesitant to try them, I urge you to reconsider!

<h2 class="title">Bitcoin on Amazon! Sort of...</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #265, May 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I was a Bitcoin fan before it was popular. That means I had thousands
of Bitcoins. It also means I sold my thousands of Bitcoins for less than
$1 each. Still, the technology fascinates me, and although cryptocurrencies
have risen and fallen, I'm still a fan.
</p><p>
There are several places to use Bitcoin on a regular basis. One
of my favorites, which I've mentioned before, is the Humble
Bundle (<a href="http://www.humblebundle.com" target="_self">www.humblebundle.com</a>). I've also ordered from Overstock.com
using Bitcoin. I often look for places I can spend Bitcoin and try to
shop at them when possible. Like most people, however, I usually end up
buying things on Amazon.
</p><p>
Thankfully, with the help of Purse.IO (<a href="http://www.purse.io" target="_self">www.purse.io</a>), you can indirectly
purchase items from Amazon using Bitcoin! I've been using Purse.IO for
more than a year, but it seemed too good to be true, so I hesitated writing
about it. The premise is this: some people have Amazon gift cards but
would rather have Bitcoin. I have Bitcoin and want to buy stuff from
Amazon. Using wish lists and an escrow system with Purse.IO, we trade. In
fact, people are willing to give a discount in order to get Bitcoin for
their gift cards, and so I can order items from Amazon and get a large
percentage (sometimes more than 25%) off the retail price. I usually agree
to around 13% off, and there are folks willing to send me things from
Amazon. Once the items from my wish list arrive, Purse.IO releases the
Bitcoin from escrow, and both parties are happy.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12015purseiof1.large.jpg"><img src="12015purseiof1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
(Photo via <a href="http://purse.io" target="_self">purse.io</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
I'm sure there are people who try to scam others by ordering items with
bad credit cards and so on, but since you release the escrow only when the
item actually arrives, the risk is pretty low. I don't think I'd want
to spend vast amounts of Bitcoin via Purse.IO, but since I don't have
vast amounts of Bitcoin, it works out quite well for me. If you have
some Bitcoin and wonder what to do with it, check out Purse.IO.
It's pretty cool!
