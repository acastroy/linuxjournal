<i  >LJ</i> arrived in the mail yesterday, and I was
surprised to see on page 56 a photo of a bicycle! But after
thinking about it, I thought, if any bicycle is appropriate for a
Linux magazine, the Bike Friday is it. It is a quality product, the
support is superlative, and it can do so many things that outsiders
don't expect. And yes, I'm talking about the bicycle&mdash;and Linux.
See, a perfect match! Incidentally, one of those things that the
Bike Friday bicycles can do is fold. It's not mentioned in the
article, but one of their biggest attractions is transporting them
in airline-sized suitcases, which then can be towed behind the
bicycle as a trailer.

an article covering the topic of using a Palm device to talk to
one's Linux box. This is a useful project that helps to prove that
Linux is more than ready for the desktop, yet has not gotten the
attention it deserves.</p><p>However, there are some problems with Coppieters' and
Velghe's otherwise useful article. First was their use of
pilot-link 0.9.3, which is an old release, and referring users to
the old FTP site at Ryerson University. Pilot-link is currently at
release level 0.9.5, and the source code for this can be found at
<a href="http://www.pilot-link.org" target="_self">www.pilot-link.org</a>.
I would also like to take the time to single out David A.
Desrosier, who picked up this project two years ago and has kept it
alive. Currently he is helping to add support for USB to pilot-link
for the next release. And should a reader currently need to use USB
to talk to her/his Palm device, there is ColdSync, which can be
found at
<a href="http://www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync" target="_self">www.ooblick.com/software/coldsync</a>.</p><p>I invite your readers who are interested in current
developments with Linux and PDAs using the Palm OS to subscribe to
the pilot-unix mailing list at
<a href="mailto:pilot-unix@hcirisc.cs.birmington.edu">pilot-unix@hcirisc.cs.birmington.edu</a>.
Besides working on USB support, work has begun to enable the
protocol that underlies the PalmPix graphics viewer so that users
can load images from their Linux box and view them on their Palm
device.</p><p>&mdash;Geoffrey Burling</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x224e580.0x23465b0"></a>Some Ultimate Advice</h2></div></div><p>In your article &ldquo;The Ultimate Linux Box 2001: How to Design
Your Dream Machine&rdquo; (unabridged web version, available at
<a href="../000/5563.html" target="_self">/article/5563</a>),
you wrote:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The SB Live! seemed to work with the stock
emu10k1.o sound module in Red Hat 7.1, but as it turns out it can't
run the earphone-out jack on the LiveDrive.</p></blockquote></div><p>Actually, it can&mdash;it just isn't set up to do so by default. I
own one of these cards, a good pair of headphones, and a cheap pair
of speakers, so I had reason to look into this. Here's how I got it
working. First, download the drivers from
<a href="http://opensource.creative.com" target="_self">opensource.creative.com</a>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cvs -d ':pserver:cvsguest@opensource.creative.com:/usr/local/cvsroot' login
[use the password 'cvsguest']
cvs -d ':pserver:cvsguest@opensource.creative.com:/usr/local/cvsroot' co emu10k1
</pre>


Everything there is under the GPL and changes here get folded into
the kernel tree, so there's no real point using this driver over
the kernel one. However, there are some utilities included that let
you (among other things) enable different inputs/outputs. So
compile and install their emu10k1.o if you want, but there's no
need to. What we're after is <b  >make tools</b>. This
gives you all sorts of tools for doing fancy things with the card,
most of which I don't understand. The only one you need to get the
headphones working is emu-dspmgr, located in the utils/mixer
directory. With it, you can pipe your choice of inputs to your
choice of outputs, e.g.:
<pre     class="programlisting">
emu-dspmgr -a'Pcm L:Phones L' emu-dspmgr
-a'Pcm R:Phones R' emu-dspmgr
-a'CD-Spdif L:Phones L'
emu-dspmgr
-a'CD-Spdif R:Phones R'

the &ldquo;Ultimate Linux Box&rdquo;, a computer reseller called Monarch
Computer at
<a href="http://www.monarchcomputer.com" target="_self">www.monarchcomputer.com</a>
is claiming that their product is this box. They've even gone so
far as to modify an image of the <i  >LJ</i> cover to
put their own company's name on the image; the image on their web
site reads &ldquo;<i  >Linux Journal</i> Ultimate Linux Box
Monarch Computer Systems&rdquo;. According to the article, it was another
hardware vendor (Los Alamos Computers) that helped put the effort
into designing and building this system. So if anybody should get
credit by way of business, it should be those guys. This seems very
sleazy.</p><p>&mdash;Mark Travis</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mark, if you look carefully at the article, you
will see that there were two boxes built&mdash;one by Los Alamos for
Eric Raymond and another by Monarch for</em></span> <i  >LJ</i> Technical
Editor Don Marti. It actually was Monarch's box that appeared on
the cover.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x224e580.0x2346d40"></a>No Word Yet</h2></div></div><p>I much appreciated the article by Jan Schaumann, &ldquo;More than
Words&rdquo; in the November 2001 issue. Not only did I learn some new
ways to deal with .doc files, but I was pleased to see him plug TeX
and LaTeX. Word processors were invented for those who want to aid
and abet in their own victimization, and the users of word
processors deserve all the problems and version incompatibilities
they experience.
</p><p>I've been a TeX and LaTeX user since 1985, and everything
I've written since then still runs through typesetting with the
same results. Using a simple text editor, one can generate
PostScript files, Portable Document Format files and HTML
files&mdash;that is, one source document can be a printable manual, a
downloadable manual and a web presentation. We even use LaTeX to
generate e-commerce click-to-buy pages, the generation of which is
easily automated. The make utility automates generation of all of
the mentioned outputs with dependency checking. Multiple authors
can take part in an &ldquo;expression&rdquo; and have it present a consistent
and always up-to-date content. Examples of our usage can be found
at
<a href="http://www.amplepower.com" target="_self">www.amplepower.com</a>
and <a href="http://www.pwrtap.com" target="_self">www.pwrtap.com</a>. Word
processors? No thanks, I have work to do.</p><p>&mdash;David Smead</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x224e580.0x2346fa8"></a>Erratum: &ldquo;2001 Readers' Choice Awards&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>(<i  >LJ</i>, November 2001)
