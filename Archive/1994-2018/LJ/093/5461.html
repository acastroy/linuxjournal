    A discussion of connectivity, Linux and the future of open source in Costa Rica.

Guy F. de T&eacute;ramond, who is the Minister of Science and
Technology of Costa Rica. Don Guy, as he is referred to by his
staff and others, is a serious Linux and free-software advocate. As
ministers are appointed by the president to their cabinet-level
positions, this puts a pro-Linux person very high up in the
government.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5461f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Guy F. de T&eacute;ramond
</p></div></div>

</p><p>I originally met him in June 2001, at the Costa Rica Linux
User's Group (GULCR). At that time he really impressed me with his
interest in Linux and with what I saw as a serious interest in
bringing good internet connectivity to the general public. This
meeting was a chance to fill in the blanks of my knowledge of his
interests and commitments.</p><p>The meeting was in his office at the Ministry. When I arrived
he was experiencing a computer problem: he had built a new kernel
for his Mandrake-based Toshiba laptop and deleted the old kernel,
before he had made sure the new one was in place and worked. He
chalked this up to a learning experience and, after our interview,
went back to doing an update from the Mandrake 8.1 CDs.</p><p>Guy is actually a research physicist who received his degrees
in Paris between 1968 and 1977. He spent a year at Harvard and a
year at Stanford. He is also a Guggenheim Fellow (1986), received a
Fulbright Research Award (1983), National Prize Clodomiro Picado
Twight (1979) and the Medal of the Association of Space Explorers
(1997).</p><p>He has served as a full professor of Physics at the
University of Costa Rica from 1982 until 2000, when he was
appointed to his current position. He is also a member of the
American Physical Society and a founding member of the National
Academy of Sciences in Costa Rica. I could go on, but I think you
have the general idea.</p><p>He was responsible for connecting Costa Rica to BITNET in
1990 and to the Internet in 1993. When asked &ldquo;Why BITNET?&rdquo;, he
explained that at the time the Internet was primarily a US
phenomenon for computer scientists, while BITNET was used for
collaboration in other fields.</p><p>When he returned to Costa Rica he was convinced of the
potential that this connectivity could bring to the country and was
responsible for the creation of CRNet, a fiber router-based
backbone linking all major academic and research institutions in
Costa Rica. Going beyond the borders, he was involved in the
interconnection of Nicaragua, Panama, Jamaica, Honduras and
Guatemala to the Internet.</p><p>I asked him about his passions, and he said theoretical
physics is first and computers and the Internet are second. He
smiled and declined to comment on his third.</p><p>He saw CRNet as something he would create to get the needed
connectivity and then go back to his work in theoretical physics.
His knowledge and experience with computing got him tied up in this
area more than he had planned. What he has done and continues to
do, however, is a huge benefit to Costa Rica.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f8d580.0x2085a28"></a>Guy's Introduction to UNIX</h2></div></div><p>The first UNIX system in Costa Rica was an IBM RISC system.
Back in 1991, Guy was in the first group of people that attended
training on that system. Another attendee was Mario Guerra, who has
become a UNIX expert and is also currently working at MICIT.</p><p>Guy soon became involved in getting other Caribbean nations
connected to the Internet. This usually meant traveling to other
countries, from Nicaragua to Jamaica, and helping them set up. In
each case, the goal was to make them self-sufficient by teaching
them what they needed to know. &ldquo;We were working together with the
people because if you go and make the connections, and nobody
learns anything, they will become dependent on you, and that's not
the idea&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;That's the idea for a private
company.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;[With CRNet] we connected 24 universities and ten
government offices&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;We always had the strategy to work
with the computer people because they will learn faster. Thus, even
though there were very few people at CRNet, we [did] a
lot.&rdquo;</p><p>This work continued and included more efforts to increase the
bandwidth available to Costa Rica, including a PanAmSat link and a
downlink-only link. Mario worked on proxying to decrease the need
for incoming bandwidth.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f8d580.0x2085c38"></a>His Current Project</h2></div></div><p>When he came to the Ministry in 2000, Guy wanted to continue
this connectivity project but at the national level&mdash;that is, bring
broadband connectivity to anyone who wanted it.</p><p>Costa Rica received a $1.2 million grant to start a DSL pilot
project. This project offers DSL connectivity in five of Costa
Rica's 240 phone districts. &ldquo;We are just using the infrastructure
that is there; just putting the logical elements on top of the
fiber and then using the copper line&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;DSL is fantastic
technology because you are using what is there.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now we are going into the second phase&rdquo;, he added. &ldquo;The
second phase has two crucial parts. We are going to deploy 100,000
DSL lines in all 240 of the nation's phone districts.&rdquo;</p><p>The first country in the world in per capita broadband
connectivity (cable and DSL) is South Korea, number two is Canada
and three is the US. With 100,000 lines, which is 10% of the copper
lines in the country (and 2.5% of the total population), this
effort will move Costa Rica up to number three.</p><p>The total cost of this effort will be about $60,000,000. This
investment, while a huge amount for Costa Rica, is relatively small
because DSL takes advantage of the fiber and copper infrastructure
already in place. Also, deploying DSL helps local telephone
districts because it substantially decreases the load on the
switched lines by getting all the long-time internet connections
moved off the switched network. &ldquo;We are paying a lot of attention
to scalable technology&mdash;not frame relay, ATM and the like&rdquo;, he
said.</p><p>Guy pointed out that this universal connectivity is happening
because of the government monopoly on telecommunications service.
ICE, the telephone company, is a government agency and adding this
internet connectivity through DSL makes perfect sense. If, on the
other hand, a private company were to offer internet connectivity,
it wouldn't be universal because connectivity to areas of low
population would not be profitable.</p><p>This is similar to what happened in the United States with
the REA, which brought electricity to virtually everyone. Today,
97% of the households in Costa Rica have electricity (100% from
natural sources), and the modern equivalent of the electricity
effort is internet connectivity.</p><p>As Guy said, &ldquo;You can do so much work from your office in
your house and spend more time with your family if you have good
communications.&rdquo; In addition, the increasing numbers of Costa
Ricans moving to population centers has stressed the transportation
infrastructure and created pollution in, for example, San
Jos&eacute;. Thus, the ability to telecommute is important to the
nation as a whole.</p><p>In addition to this fiber/copper infrastructure, they are
experimenting with communications over the power line. The
electrical distribution also is done by ICE so, for example, the
existing fiber run along the power grid for monitoring will be made
available as a backup for the telecommunications fiber
links.</p><p>To support all this connectivity, there needs to be increased
bandwidth to the Internet outside of Costa Rica as well. That
brought the discussion to Arcos. Arcos is a ring-based system in
the Caribbean that covers Mexico, the other countries of Central
America, the Caribbean islands and Miami. It has a bandwidth of
about a terabyte/second, and its structure is such that all the
repeaters will be located on land, making an upgrade much less
expensive than typical sea-based repeaters.</p><p>Arcos should be in operation by the time you read this
article. Guy explains they decided to go with Arcos because it
offers much less expensive bandwidth than did satellite
links.</p><p>He also stressed that the project is to connect everyone:
individuals, schools health centers and such, as well as banks,
commerce and high-tech businesses.</p><p>There already has been a hearing on rates, and all the
comments have been in the direction of reducing them further. (The
proposal was $30/month for 64k DSL, $40/month for 128k and so
forth, including the line and the ISP.) As ICE is a public agency,
the rates will reflect cost of service rather than the need to show
a profit.</p><p>The engineering part of the project has just been completed.
The design is scalable and offers, for example, easy ways to
implement security. They have been careful to follow ITU standards,
so there will be no dispute over what they have specified.</p><p>The request for bids are about to go out for the additional
equipment, and initial funding has already been approved by the
government. The goal is to start deployment in January 2002.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f8d580.0x2086210"></a>What about Free Software?</h2></div></div><p>Knowing that Guy is into Linux, we discussed the future of
free software in Costa Rica.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span> How does Linux play
into this? Your connectivity project makes it possible for someone
who lives in Quepos [a coastal city far from the capital] to decide
they want to become a computer consultant. Is there something else
that you have planned to get Linux into the community?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guy</b></span> At the University [of
Costa Rica], there was a very integrated system of different
technologies. At the end-user level, every user or department was
free to put whatever OS or application they wanted on their
systems, but most picked Windows or Mac&mdash;mostly Windows at the user
level. A few crazy fellows in the Math and Engineering departments
picked Linux.</p><p>In the center we have about 100 servers. They were all
running Linux, except the databases, which were, at that time,
running under Solaris on SPARC.</p><p>I think that Linux, in the last two or three years, has
really made some progress for the end user. What we see again, if
you use layers, is at the bottom you have common infrastructure and
at the top you have the user. The more you go toward common
infrastructure, the more it is open source, and the more you go
toward the end user it is proprietary software.</p><p>In the coming years, we will see this line going up or going
down. That is going to depend a lot on what the Linux and Open
Source community does in developing applications for the end
user.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span> I agree.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guy</b></span> So this is a moving
frontier. Of course, now almost everything is open source. You have
the people who developed the TCP/IP protocols and Tim Berners-Lee
with the HTML protocol. They made a fantastic contribution to
humankind, then put it out as open source.</p><p>And, by the way, who is the biggest user of open source in
the world? It is Microsoft, for example, with TCP/IP. They can put
Microsoft Network on the Web, but it is TCP/IP.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span> And, if it isn't, it
doesn't talk.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guy</b></span> Exactly. In 1995,
Microsoft protocol was NetBUI and NetBIOS, and it wasn't routable.
Those are LAN protocols. At some point they made the very important
decision to embrace TCP/IP. One has to agree that it is easy to
satanize open source, but they are using it [themselves]. So we
have this moving frontier. To go a little bit above, you have the
web servers. You have Apache vs. IIS. Not only does Apache have 60%
of the market, but it is free and reliable. And you have the report
from The Gartner Group, for example, about the security issues,
which are not a joke.</p><p>All of this to answer your question. To give you an example,
here at the Ministry all of our servers run Linux. We are now
extending that to many areas of the government. For myself and our
engineers, we run Linux for everyday life. And because of the
viruses, I can't go back.</p><p>However, I must say that I use a modified kernel because I
really need to run [MS]Office. To be fair, Word and Excel are the
standards. In open source we have not reached that level,
yet.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span> Even Linus uses
Microsoft applications such as PowerPoint. They may not know how to
write an operating system, but they write good applications.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guy</b></span> Exactly. I use this
modified kernel that works beautifully, and I have my PowerPoint
presentation and use Word and Excel because I don't have time to
translate these files to another format. But it [Windows] is a
program running under my OS, and I don't care if it has a virus or
not.</p><p>I have the best of both worlds. The worlds will complement
each other and that is healthy.</p><p>A country like ours has become very good in software
development. It is one of our most important industries. So we
must, of course, push this industry.</p><p>Let's move to the second question, what are we going to do
about that? Here at the Ministry&mdash;engineers, myself, Linux fans&mdash;we
will not go back. I do my scientific papers in LaTeX; everything is
there.</p><p>At this point we can't make a decree to put the whole
government on open source&mdash;yet. We have tasks with secretaries
where they will lose their productivity. They cannot work as
fast.</p><p>This will change in the future. However, this is a process.
Right now, mail servers, web servers and databases are on Linux.
One of our engineers can monitor every server from here. It's
powerful, it's secure and it's the best environment you can find in
the world right now. Today you cannot say that all the Ministries
will run on Linux. We are not there yet. The day will come when the
office productivity suite will be integrated into the desktop and
will be considered common infrastructure, but not yet.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span> So, I guess that
answers the next question, which is that we, the Linux community,
have to keep building better tools for the user, and the transition
will happen.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guy</b></span> Absolutely. There is a
second aspect to this. It's about education and schools. Here the
pedagogical and instructional value of open source is
incomparable.</p><p>You need to teach all primary and secondary school students
the basic skills with Word and Excel, of course, but in the higher
grades the values of open source are incomparable because the first
to the last line of code is there. You know the program. It's
amazing.</p><p>So imagine following the program line by line. You can change
it, adapt it and make a simple version to monitor an experiment.
Our industry will benefit from that because we will have very good
programmers. The educational value, at a higher level, is very
significant.</p><p>This is, of course, very close to the scientific model, where
the results are open and free for discussion; only the best results
remain. Only the best code survives.</p><p>I would like it if open source comes more into the high
schools. That is something I would like to push more, but it
depends on the Ministry of Education. I would like to see the
bright kids changing the code and compiling and making a lot of
mistakes, like I did.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span> When offered the
opportunity to work with the code, I have seen people get much more
interested in getting involved. Where do you go from here?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guy</b></span> The problem is not what
to do, it is the time to do it. As I said, my dream was to do
frontier science from wherever you are. Of course, I am now
extremely excited to follow the development of networking. This
complements my career in Physics well. I think it was easy for me
to go into this project because it is easy for me to have order of
magnitude estimates.</p><p>Just to give you an example about why it is important to have
an education in basic sciences, there was discussion of whether the
backbone was to be wireless or with fiber. Someone who is trained
in physics knows that in fiber the frequency is 1015. So that means
information you can convey on a fiber, for all practical purposes,
is infinite. With microwave, the frequency is between 106 and 108.
So this discussion was irrelevant because you cannot pack more than
an order of magnitude or two of bits at the frequency.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span> I'm very impressed with
your philosophy and, generally, with what I have seen as Costa
Rica's philosophy. In the US there is so much argument about what
the government should supply. Health care is a perfect example.
Healthy people can be more productive. If the government can supply
this infrastructure, the kind of connectivity you are talking
about, for example, you're going to get more done. You are going to
create people that are out there to accomplish things.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guy</b></span> I think health care is a
very good example. Here it is universal. You are not going to die
in the street.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Phil</b></span> I had one other
question about percentages of free software usage and such, but it
seems you are saying the real answer is that the Linux and Open
Source communities need to continue to develop user applications,
and the transition will happen naturally.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Guy</b></span> Absolutely. The progress
in these last couple of years has been impressive, but of course,
we need to continue to work much more.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f8d580.0x247f5e8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I enjoyed interviewing Don Guy, and I am very impressed with
him. His interest in education and universal access is a real
credit to his dedication. The fact that this is happening is a real
credit to the Costa Rican government in general.</p><p>I mentioned to him that we were giving trips to Costa Rica to
the winners of the first contest we had in <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i>, and he said that he hoped he could do something
&ldquo;official&rdquo; for them. So my bottom line is that Linux and open
source are alive and well in Costa Rica, and it feels like it could
expand easily in the whole region. Hopefully, Costa Rica can set
the example for domination by Linux in Central America.</p><p><a href="5461s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
