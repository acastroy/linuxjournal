    Entity beings? No, beans. Learn to write 'em, connect 'em to a database and access 'em via their cousin, the session bean.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1caa580.0x1da2608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month, we began to look at
Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), the centerpiece of Sun's J2EE (Java 2
Enterprise Edition) standard for server-side web applications.
While neither the Java language nor the J2EE specification are open
standards, increasing numbers of Linux advocates have begun to use
them to write server-side web applications. The fact that J2EE
appears to be the only mainstream alternative to Microsoft's .NET
framework makes it even more appealing to many.
</p><p>Enterprise JavaBeans come in two basic flavors, known as
session beans and entity beans. Session beans typically model
processes and lack any state, allowing us to place our business
logic in EJB, rather than in our servlets or JavaServer Pages
(JSPs). The calculator object we designed last month, which allowed
us to multiply two numbers, was a simple example of a session bean
with a single method.</p><p>Entity beans are meant to contain state, possibly even
complex state. This state normally reflects the contents of a row
in a relational database, with the bean managing its own
object-relational mapping (bean-managed persistence or BMP) or
allowing EJB to handle this task instead (container-managed
persistence or CMP). The EJB container also provides transactions,
giving us all-or-nothing operations in our objects as well as the
database.</p><p>This month, we write a simple entity bean, connect it to a
database and access it via a session bean from a Java application.
We will use the open-source JBoss EJB container (released under the
GNU Lesser General Public License, aka LGPL), but the code should
work with little modification on any J2EE server that supports
EJB.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1caa580.0x1da2818"></a>Creating Entity Beans</h2></div></div><p>As we saw last month, writing a session bean really means
writing three Java classes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The bean class performs the actual work.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The remote interface has methods that match those
on the bean class and is our proxy to the bean.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The home interface helps us to create new instances
of the bean class, as well as search for beans matching particular
criteria.</p></li></ul></div><p>We need to implement all three of these classes for an entity
bean. In addition, we often need to implement a fourth &ldquo;primary
key&rdquo; class. While this month's example does not need to define a
primary key class, we will do so in the interest of
completeness.</p><p>Most EJB applications will end up using at least one entity
bean (to model the data) and at least one session bean (to
implement the business logic). Given that a core idea of
object-oriented programming is to put data and code in a single
package, it seems a bit strange to split entity and session beans
in this way. But this strategy does seem to work overall and makes
it relatively easy to split work among multiple people, once the
specification has been agreed upon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1caa580.0x1da2ce8"></a>Working with JAWS</h2></div></div><p>J2EE is a specification; the actual implementation of that
specification depends on whoever has written the server. One of the
most important parts of a J2EE application server is the
object-relational mapper, which transparently turns Java classes
into rows of a relational database table (and vice versa). An
object-relational mapper should remain as invisible as possible,
allowing us to change our back-end storage from Oracle to MySQL
without modifying our Java code.</p><p>The JBoss object-relational mapping system is known as JAWS
and normally requires very little configuration. However, it can be
instructive to look at the JAWS configuration file
(standardjaws.xml, in the JBoss conf/default directory) to see
what's happening behind the scenes.</p><p>The definitions at the top of standardjaws.xml set parameters
for the entire JBoss server. In this way, we indicate which
database we want to use; the HyperSonic database is included with
JBoss, and we will use it for this month's examples.</p><p>The core of standardjaws.xml is the multiple
&lt;type-mapping&gt; (singular) sections, which connect each
&lt;java-type&gt; to a &lt;jdbc-type&gt; and an &lt;sql-type&gt;
for each database. Since our EJBs do not create tables or write SQL
explicitly, it's important that these values be accurate. You may
be able to increase the efficiency or flexibility of your
application by modifying these values. However, remember that
modifying JAWS after you already have inserted data into a database
may lead to confusion, corruption or errors.</p><p>If you simply want to get started with EJB, then you won't
need to modify standardjaws.xml at all. Rather, you'll need to
modify jboss.jcml, an XML file that defines the different managed
beans (MBeans) that JBoss uses for system configuration and
control.</p><p>The file jboss.jcml includes support for HyperSonic and
InstantDB; in order for it to work with HyperSonic, I had to remove
any reference to InstantDB from jboss.jcml. I did this by editing
the &ldquo;JDBC&rdquo; section of jboss.jcml, removing the mention of
org.enhydra.instantdb.jdbc.idbDriver from the &ldquo;Drivers&rdquo; attribute
for the JdbcProvider MBean and the entire XADataSourceLoader
&lt;mbean&gt;, whose service is XADataSource and whose service name
is InstantDB.</p><p>Once you have removed all mentions of InstantDB from
jboss.jcml, start up JBoss:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd $JBOSS_DIST/bin
sh run.sh
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1caa580.0x1da3058"></a>Writing Our Entity Bean</h2></div></div><p>Our entity bean models a single book, where each book has a
title, an author, a publisher and a price. For the sake of
simplicity and space, we will ignore the possibility that a book
might have multiple authors or publishers. We also will avoid
normalizing the data, which would mean having instance variables
that are themselves entity beans.</p><p>We begin by implementing the BookBean class, depicted in
Listing 1 [available at
<a href="../listings/093/5577.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue93/5577.tgz</a>].
BookBean is a typical simple bean class definition for a
container-managed entity bean; it defines a field for each column
in the database that we want to trace, including an integer &ldquo;id&rdquo;
field that serves as a primary key.</p><p>We must define the ejbCreate() method to match the signature
of the create() method on the home interface. Each time someone
invokes create() on the home interface, the EJB container invokes
ejbCreate() on our bean class with the same arguments.
<span   class="bold"><b>ejbCreate()</b></span> is where the real
creation action is; while a CMP entity bean doesn't need to worry
about handling the object-relational mapping, it does need to set
its instance variables to appropriate values.</p><p>Other than ejbCreate(), the only methods we must write are
the &ldquo;getter&rdquo; and &ldquo;setter&rdquo; methods for each field, such that other
objects can retrieve or modify the field's value. Each method is
pretty simple in our example, returning or modifying the value of
an instance variable.</p><p>Our remote interface, shown in Listing 2, is called
Book.java, and its API is almost identical to the bean class.
Applications normally will talk to the remote interface; if
something goes wrong, it throws a RemoteException.</p><p><a href="5577l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Source code for our
remote interface, Book.java&mdash;this class mirrors the public methods
defined by our BookBean class.</a></p><p>We also define a home interface, shown in Listing 3, with a
create() method that creates a new instance of Book (and
implicitly, a new row in our database table) when handed all of a
book's details. If we were so inclined, we could offer users
multiple versions of create(), each of which would take a different
number of arguments.</p><p><a href="5577l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Defining a Home
Interface</a></p><p>Notice how our create() method requires that we provide an
explicit primary key. Experienced database programmers know that
primary keys should be hidden from view, and most databases have a
way to automate this; PostgreSQL's SERIAL type, MySQL's AUTO
INCREMENT and Oracle's sequences are common solutions to this
problem. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to use such
automatically generated primary keys within EJB. Therefore, we must
set it explicitly (as in this month's examples) or use an external
value, such as the ISBN, which could be a String. This is one of
the most surprising things that I've found about EJB, and I hope
that future versions of the specification will remedy the
situation.</p><p>The findBy...() methods allow us to locate and retrieve
instances of Book. Invoking findByPrimaryKey(5) returns an instance
of Book with the primary key 5. All of the findBy...() methods are
implemented by the EJB container, saving us from having to do so
ourselves. The findAll() method returns a collection of all objects
of this type (i.e., all rows in the database table), allowing you
to iterate through them.</p><p>Unfortunately, automatically defined findAll...() methods use
simple equality checks. We cannot use regular expressions or other
techniques to search for books whose author field begins with O, or
whose publisher begins with A and ends with M. Instead, we must use
findAll(), iterating through the returned collection and filtering
through them as necessary.</p><p>Finally, our primary key class (BookPK.java), shown in
Listing 4, defines a single instance variable (id) that acts as our
primary key. The equals() method indicates whether two instances of
BookPK are identical, allowing the system to compare two instances
of Book. The hashCode() method must return a unique value for each
instance, which can be the id in this particular case. The
toString() method must return a string version of the primary key,
which simply returns String.valueOf(id) in our class.</p><p><a href="5577l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. BookPK.java, the Primary
Key Class for Our Entity Bean</a></p><p>Because all four of these classes are in the
il.co.lerner.book package, I placed all four source files
(Book.java, BookBean.java, BookHome.java and BookPK.java) in the
directory $BOOK/il/co/lerner/book, where BOOK is the root directory
of this project.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1caa580.0x1da3790"></a>Deployment Descriptor</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have defined our entity bean, we need to describe
it to the EJB container. Our deployment descriptor, a file named
ejb-jar.xml, is shown in Listing 5. We place ejb-jar.xml in
$BOOK/il/co/lerner/book/, alongside the Java classes that will form
our entity bean; when we build the bean with Ant, it will be placed
in a subdirectory named META-INF.</p><p><a href="5577l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. ejb-jar.xml, the
Deployment Descriptor for Our Entity Bean</a></p><p>The most interesting parts of ejb-jar.xml for an entity bean
are the &lt;persistence-type&gt; section (set to &ldquo;Container&rdquo; for
CMP), the &lt;prim-key-field&gt; and &lt;prim-key-class&gt;
sections (in which we name the class of our primary key), and the
&lt;cmp-field&gt; sections (which describe the container-managed
fields to JBoss).</p><p>The deployment descriptor is a standard part of EJB and
should work across all EJB servers and containers. However, it does
not address all of the runtime configuration issues. For JBoss to
work correctly, we thus include a file named jboss.xml that tells
the server where we can find the beans on the network. A copy of
jboss.xml, which we place alongside ejb-jar.xml in
$BOOK/il/co/lerner/book/, is shown here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;jboss&gt;
  &lt;enterprise-beans&gt;
    &lt;entity&gt;
      &lt;ejb-name&gt;Book&lt;/ejb-name&gt;
      &lt;jndi-name&gt;Book&lt;/jndi-name&gt;
    &lt;/entity&gt;
  &lt;/enterprise-beans&gt;
&lt;/jboss&gt;
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1caa580.0x1da3a50"></a>Application</h2></div></div><p>The source code for our simple test application,
UseBook.java, is presented in Listing 6 [available at
<a href="../listings/093/5577.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue93/5577.tgz</a>]
and demonstrates how much you can do with very little code. It
defines only a main() method and immediately goes about working
with the EJBs. First it grabs a JNDI context and looks up the Book
bean that we have defined. That allows it to create an instance of
BookHome, which in turn lets us create a new instance of our Book
bean:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Book book = home.create(testPrimaryKey, "Book title",
                        "AuthorFirst AuthorLast",
                        "PublisherName", 10.50);
</pre><p>As you can see, we've hard-coded the values we will add to
the database, including the primary key. This is obviously
unacceptable in the real world; a nonexample application would have
taken the primary key (and other values) from a file, the command
line, an environment variable, an HTML form on the Web or would
have generated them automatically.
</p><p>Notice how we never have to create SQL tables, insert rows or
retrieve them. Our back-end persistent storage is presumably a
relational database, but our Java client neither knows nor
cares.</p><p>Once it has inserted a new row into the table, UseBook
modifies some of its values (by setting instance variable values)
and then retrieves all of the instances of Book in the database
(with findAll()). Along the way, it sends status messages to
System.out, which are printed on the console.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1caa580.0x219bf60"></a>Ant Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>We use Ant, the Java replacement for the standard make
program, to compile and install our program. Listing 7 [available
at
<a href="../listings/093/5577.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue93/5577.tgz</a>]
shows our build.xml file, which compiles each of the .java source
files from $BOOK/il/co/lerner/book, turns them into a jar file
along with the deployment descriptor and JBoss runtime
configuration file, and then installs the files into the JBOSS
directory. If Ant is installed in ANT, you can compile all of the
files, install them into the JBoss &ldquo;deploy&rdquo; directory and invoke
UseBook.main() with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ANT/bin/ant use-book-ejb
</pre><p>As soon as JBoss notices the new (or updated) jar file, you
will see output on the screen indicating what the server is doing.
The output from Ant, by contrast, will display all of the items
sent to System.out from within main(), including the status
messages in Listing 6 that indicate what we have done. Each time
you compile and run main() with a new ID value, a new row will be
inserted into the database table.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1caa580.0x219c170"></a>Is EJB the Future?</h2></div></div><p>Sun would like you to believe that EJB is the future of all
server-side web applications. Microsoft, of course, is doing its
utmost to convince you that .NET is the real future. How do
independent developers fare in this war of giants, and what should
free software advocates do?</p><p>The good news is that J2EE is an excellent architecture and
philosophy. It's neither the most elegant nor the most flexible,
and it does lock you into a single language. But overall, I'm
impressed with J2EE and see it as an important milestone in the
world of web application programming.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are a number of issues with J2EE that
arise every time I use it to write an application. The first issue
is that neither Java nor J2EE are open source, despite the fact
that Java is free of charge and JBoss is licensed under the LGPL.
Sun generally has been an honest player, but they are a commercial
company with their own interests. Open-source advocates should not
be surprised if and when Sun restricts the use of code or
specifications.</p><p>In addition, the departure of Enhydra Enterprise appears to
leave JBoss as the only open-source J2EE application server on the
market. JBoss isn't officially certified as J2EE-compliant,
however, because the JBoss team cannot pay for official
certification. This strikes me as rather shortsighted of Sun;
perhaps they could offer free or inexpensive certification for
servers released under the GPL or LGPL, which (unlike the Berkeley
license) ensure that no company could ever turn a certified server
into a proprietary product. Official J2EE certification isn't
important to me, but there are many CEOs and CTOs who do require
it, which means that JBoss is often ignored for no good
reason.</p><p>Java and EJB are complex, and it will take time for a
programmer to learn about them. But the complexity of Java and EJB
programming is dwarfed, in my experience, by a confusing array of
configuration files, new terms, environment variables and other
items that are unique to Java. Better documentation would certainly
help, but it seems to me that a Java analogue to CPAN, which would
make server-side Java configuration easier, would let programmers
concentrate on programming rather than system maintenance
issues.</p><p>Finally, the one part of .NET that really appeals to me is
its relative openness to different programming languages. By
definition, J2EE requires Java, which is often the right choice but
should never be the only choice. SOAP and XML-RPC make it possible
to bridge the gap between languages but without the nice
transactioning and object-relational mapping that EJB brings to the
table. For now, it seems that the only way for Python to speak to
EJB is via SOAP or XML-RPC (or Jython), but I would love to see
other possibilities in the future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1caa580.0x219c430"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>EJB is an impressive technology, doing far more than the
simple object-relational mappers Alzabo and DODS. From my
experience, working with EJB is more of a managerial and logistical
headache than a technical one. Learning EJB is a good idea for all
web application developers; it's clear that this standard is making
serious inroads in the industry, and many serious applications will
be built using EJB in the future. Having certified open-source
implementations will make it even easier for programmers to try out
EJB, and I encourage Sun to move in this direction as soon as
possible.</p><p>Next month, we'll switch gears to begin looking at Zope, a
very different type of web application framework written mostly in
Python. Zope has become quite popular in the last few years and is
often seen as the killer app that will bring Python to the
forefront of programming languages. We'll take a look at Zope and
start to examine how we can use it to write our own
applications.</p><p><a href="5577s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
