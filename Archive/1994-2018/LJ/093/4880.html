    Olexiy and Denis provide an introduction to the features of network filesystem (NFS).
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ec580.0x19e48c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you have two or more machines, you may
wish to share disk space or devices, such as a CD drive, between
machines. For this there is network filesystem (NFS), the easiest
way of sharing files and resources across a network.
</p><p>NFS is the way of working with files on a remote machine as
if they are on your local one. NFS is the standard de facto
solution to access the same $HOME directories from any machine on
the Net. Using it also is a good way to avoid keeping duplicated
information from eating large amounts of disk space.</p><p>NFS originally was introduced by engineers at Sun
Microsystems in 1985. Quite ancient, but still good, NFS continues
to experience improvements. Sun is working on producing an NFS
version 4 implementation for Linux that is now in the development
stage.</p><p>The standard version of NFS for Linux is 3. This article
deals with this version. From an ordinary user's point of view,
there are only few differences between versions.</p><p>Installing NFS both on the client and the server sides is not
so hard. We show some basic NFS features and explain their use.
Many commands have to be executed as root, so think 37 times before
pressing Enter.</p><p>But first, how NFS works. NFS is the most-known service using
remote procedure call (RPC). As an example, let's say a server
machine, named tiger, keeps all $HOME files in the directory /home.
From your local machine, named blackcat, you would issue the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t nfs tiger:/home /home
</pre><p>According to this command, mount will try to connect to the
rpc.mountd d&aelig;mon on server tiger via RPC. The server will
check if the request is permitted to mount /home from blackcat and
return a file handle that in turn may be used to serve all requests
to files below /home. If the request is not permitted, we will see
the corresponding diagnostic message. Note that the colon in the
command indicates the filesystem is remote, so -t nfs may be
omitted. Let's imagine the file handle was returned successfully,
and we are dealing with a kind tiger.
</p><p>When a user on blackcat tries to access a file on NFS, the
kernel makes an RPC call to the NFS d&aelig;mon, usually rpc.nfsd,
passing as parameters the name of the file, user and group ID (uid
and gid). Thus the server, tiger, can prevent unauthorized access
before sending the file handle. The process of mounting is shown in
Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4880f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Mounting Process
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ec580.0x19e4e48"></a>Setting up the NFS Server</h2></div></div><p>If you want to have your Linux machine acting as the NFS
server, you have to run the rpc.mountd program there. This program
helps the stage of mounting and passes mount-NFS requests to the
rpc.nfsd program, which does almost all work and acts as the NFS
server. RPC protocol also defines using performance statistics from
the kernel on the serving machine, which in turn helps in working
with rpc.lockd and rpc.rquotad. Since kernel 2.2.18, rpc.lockd is
evoked by rpc.nfsd on request and thus may not be started manually.
The rpc.rquotad program has to be started in order for quota
service to work on NFS.</p><p>As you remember, we mentioned RPC. This means that for NFS to
connect we do not need to change /etc/inetd.config for the program
that rules the internet super server, inetd. NFS uses another
program, portmapper, which shows the way to find all NFS services
on the system.</p><p>The very first guard to protect your machine from everlasting
net requests uses a pair of files, /etc/hosts.allow and
/etc/hosts.deny, to allow the requests to be processed or rejected.
This guard recognizes two things: the type of request and the host
that sends it. Then it has a look at the file hosts.allow to find
those parameters. If found, the request will pass. If not, the
guard sees /etc/hosts.deny, and the inquiry is rejected if the pair
matches. If the pair does not match either /etc/hosts.allow or
/etc/hosts.deny, the request will be passed.</p><p>If you are setting the server, say, for an educational
establishment, you have to pay more attention to security. In any
such establishment there is, for instance, &ldquo;the fifth column&rdquo;,
usually from students: one part is sniffing your passwords and
other sensitive information, the second one is sending &ldquo;I love you&rdquo;
e-mails, the third gifts you with Trojan horses. NFS, especially
its old releases, has a set of features with potentially
low-security levels. So, better to set up these files
correctly.</p><p>To find out more about these files, consult hosts_access in
man page section five. But, it is usually enough to forbid access
to portmapper and other NFS requests for all machines, and allow
demands for particular hosts or subnets. So, in the file
/etc/hosts.deny you need to put these rows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
portmap:ALL
lockd:ALL
mountd:ALL
rquotad:ALL
statd:ALL
</pre><p>After this action, nobody can access your NFS server, and of
course this is not what we need, so let us also change the
/etc/hosts.allow file. The common format for the lines in the file
look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
daemon list : ... user pattern@host pattern
</pre>


For example, in order to allow using NFS for machines blackcat and
tomcat with IP addresses 192.168.16.13 and 192.168.16.24,
respectively, we have to add the corresponding lines in
/etc/hosts.allow file for all services that we disabled:
<pre     class="programlisting">
portmap : 192.168.16.13  192.168.16.24
lockd   : 192.168.16.13  192.168.16.24
mountd  : 192.168.16.13  192.168.16.24
rquotad : 192.168.16.13  192.168.16.24
statd   : 192.168.16.13  192.168.16.24
</pre>


If you are using an NFS connection with a set of clients that
usually occupies a continuing subnet and so have the corresponding
addresses in the range, the row with allowed hosts may be too long.
To simplify, there is another way of pointing to such a set of
clients: in this case address/netmask is used, for it makes the
files shorter and more readable. For example,
192.168.16.0/255.255.255 matches all IP addresses in the range
192.168.16.0 to 192.168.16.255.
</p><p>To this point, we mentioned only common features that apply
to many net services. The config file for NFS service,
/etc/exports, is more specific. On those two machines of the cat
family, blackcat and tomcat, mount /home and /usr/doc directories
via NFS:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/home    192.168.16.11(rw,root squash)
192.168.16.24(rw)
/usr/doc 192.168.16.11(ro,root squash)
192.168.16.24(ro)
</pre><p>The format is clean; in the left field we put the name of the
directory to export and then enumerate pairs
host(<span   class="emphasis"><em>permissions</em></span>). Note: there is no space
after the IP address. In the example above we may write and read in
/home, and only read /usr/doc and subdirectories. The parameter
root_squash is needed to protect files from client root access.
This means that a user (say, a student), after having successfully
cracked the client root password, may become root but still cannot
access or change files that only root on the server can. This is
good, and the option is set by default. The word squash means that
the root user will have the same access as user nobody.
</p><p>If we look at the situation with root carefully, we also will
deduce that we should do something with user and group
identification numbers: uid and gid. If a user has different uid
and gid on a client and on the server, the user may not access
fully his or her own files, but may access files belonging to
another user.</p><p>To avoid this situation, you may set the file to indicate
static mapping for uid/gid. In the example below, the option points
to the file /etc/nfs/home_map.cats and may look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
map_static=/etc/nfs/home map.cats
</pre><p>The file for mapping, home_map.cats may look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# Mapping for cat's machines:
#    server    client
uid   0-60       -    # switch to nobody
uid   61-80     41    # map 61-80 into 41-60
</pre>


The process of communication between d&aelig;mons both on the
server and client is shown in Figure 2.
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4880f2.large.jpg"><img src="4880f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Communication between D&aelig;mons
</p></div></div>

</p><p>If you have an NIS system running, the NFS server may use it
to consult on uid/gid. In this case you should use another option,
map_nis=kingdom.cat. This solution is more clever; the NFS server
will obtain the corresponding information from the NIS domain
kingdom.cat.</p><p>To allow mount process for a group of trusted users described
in your NIS system, you may use the parameter @group. If you put,
say @catowners, only the host part of all members of the group
catowners is extracted to add to the access list.</p><p>Having those files correctly installed, you should then start
the corresponding programs. Because NFS uses portmapper, portmapper
should be run first. In recent distributions of Linux, portmap or
rpc.portmap starts while the system is booting. You may check the
current status of the program by issuing the following two commands
in one line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ps axu | egrep portmap
</pre><p>If the portmap is running, you will see something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
daemon 99    0.0 0.3 1132 500 ?     S Jul11 0:02
/sbin/portmap
tiger  27837 0.0 0.3 1264 492 pts/0 R 17:03 0:00
egrep portmap
</pre>


The first line here informs that portmap is running. If portmapper
is not running, you should try to run it manually. The program
usually is located in /sbin, but if not, try /usr/sbin. If the
program is not available, you have to install it. The name of the
package to install may be something like netbase or nkitb.
</p><p>Having run the portmapper, you can start the needed
d&aelig;mons: rpc.mountd, rpc.nfsd, rpc.statd, rpc.lockd and
rpc.quotad. These d&aelig;mons must be started in exactly this
sequence. Modern distributions (we have checked Debian 2.2r3, Red
Hat 7.1 and SuSE 7.0) have start/stop scripts for the services. If
you have trouble finding such scripts, you may take a ready-made
one from a SuSE or Red Hat distribution and correct it by hand, or
write your own.</p><p>In general, rpc.rquotad is needed only if you use the quota
system to limit disk space for the users. In recent versions of the
kernel, rpc.lockd is called by rpc.nfsd on request but starting it
from the script is okay.</p><p>After starting all those programs, execute the command
<b  >rpcinfo -p</b>. The output of this command shows
what programs are running currently, their versions and other
useful information. At least portmapper, mountd and nfsd must be
running to enable you to use the NFS server. If you have any
problems, you can find help in the Linux NFS-HOWTO document.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ec580.0x19e5a50"></a>Setting up the NFS Client</h2></div></div><p>First, make sure your Linux kernel supports NFS. The status
of your system is reflected by proc directory. To look inside the
filesystems file, execute the cat command, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tomcat&gt; cat /proc/filesystems
         ext2
nodev    proc
nodev    devpts
         iso9660
nodev    nfs
</pre><p>This file shows you what kind of filesystems you may use with
your version of the kernel. If the line <b  >nodev
nfs</b> is missing, it may mean your NFS filesystem support
module is not installed. In this case, try to execute the command
<b  >modpobe nfs</b>. You must be root to execute it. The
output of the command delineates the situation. If module is
compiled, the command installs it, and if you repeat the cat
command, the clue line will be shown. If your kernel does not
support the NFS server, you probably will have to recompile it, but
this topic is far beyond the scope of this article.
</p><p>If you have NFS supported, you can mount files located on the
server machine, as we showed in the example. The full format for
the mount command is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t nfs <span   class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span>:exp dir local dir options
</pre><p>Here <span   class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span> is the name of your NFS
server, and exp_dir is the full path to the directory to export on
the server machine.
</p><p>Usually this is the end of the story, but to reach maximum
productivity for connection via NFS, let's look at options
parameters. We will use them later for sure:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>rsize=n and wsize=n: specify the size of the
datagram sent or accepted by the NFS client while reading and
writing requests, respectively. The default value depends on the
version of the kernel and may be set in 1,024 bytes. The larger the
piece of food your cat can eat at one time, the quicker it finishes
eating. So, the bigger the value you hput ecere, the quicker your
work with a remote file will be. If you place 4,096 or even 8,192
here, throughput may be improved greatly.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>timeo=n and retrans=n: answer for reaction on RPC
timeouts. If your pet (take a cat, for example) has eaten a lot, it
is able to take a new little piece of food, after a short period of
time to be digested a little, and eat a lot again after a long
period of time. These time intervals are called minor and major,
respectively. Although NFS is not a cat, it also has minor and
major time intervals, connected with the reaction of the server.
Either the Net or the server, or even both, may be down temporarily
or inaccessible. If this occurs, the resending starts after timeo
tenths of second. Standard value for this minor timeout is seven.
So if there is no reply within 0.7 second, NFS client will repeat
the same request and double the timeout (1.4 seconds) by default.
If there is still no reply, the procedure will be repeated until a
maximum, major timeout of 60 seconds is reached. The quantity of
minor timeouts that must occur before a major timeout will be
reached, is set by the retrans parameter; its default value is
three.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>hard and soft: define the reaction if major timeout
is reached. In the first case, if default value hard is set, NFS
client reports the error &ldquo;server not responding, still trying&rdquo; on
the console and continues to try to connect. So when the NFS server
is back on-line, the program will continue to run from where it
was. For the opposite, if value soft is set, the NFS client will
report an I/O error to the process accessing a file on an
NFS-mounted filesystem, and some files may be corrupted by losing
data, so use the soft option with care.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>intr: allows for interrupting an NFS call and is
useful for canceling the job if the server doesn't respond after a
long time.</p></li></ul></div><p>The recommended options are intr and hard, and since the
latter is the default, intr is enough. With these parameters, we
are able to try to increase performance of the NFS
connection.</p><p>Often we want to do the process of mounting in a hidden way
(transparently), perhaps while booting the system. In this case we
have to create the corresponding line in the file named /etc/fstab
that the system reads while booting. Any line in that file has as a
minimum four fields, usually six. Here's an example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1)device 2)mnt point 3)fs type 4)options
5)dump 6)check order
tiger:/nfs1/home /home nfs rw,hard,intr 0 2
</pre><p>The first parameter describes the device to be mounted. In
this example, the NFS server tiger exports /nfs1/home filesystem as
the home directory. Field number four points to this filesystem as
nfs. The last parameters mean the filesystem should not be dumped
and checked in the second order. You can find more details in
section five of the man pages. It also is a good idea to start
rpc.lockd and rpc.statd. These programs usually initialize from
scripts. Once you've done those things, you should have the NFS
client running.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ec580.0x19dccd8"></a>Planning to Use NFS</h2></div></div><p>What kind of data can we keep on NFS? The simplest answer is
any kind, including the whole root system for diskless machines. In
order to plan your system, you have to take into account that all
files can be divided into two categories: shareable and unshareable
data. The latter must be kept on a particular machine. For
instance, device (and lock) files are not shareable. The size of
some directories is stable for some and unstable for others.</p><p>Assuming we have a small system, we show /home as typical
shareable data that should be located on the server host. On medium
and large systems, it is useful to subdivide user home directories
by using such names as /home/students, etc. The size of the $HOME
directory is not static, of course, but to limit disk space for
many people, you may set up a quota system on the servers.</p><p>What about another directories? Some of them have a static
size, some change permanently. Shareable static directories include
/usr and /opt, while unshareable static directories include /etc
and /boot. Static variable directories include /var/mail and
/var/spool/news, whereas unshareable variable directories include
/var/run and /var/lock.</p><p>Many people do not put /usr/bin and /bin files on NFS because
of speed, but this is not very critical. We believe an ordinary
user does not notice any difference in calling a program from an
NFS directory vs. from a local one. Therefore, if disk space is
critical, you may mount mostly everything via NFS, importing files
from the server machine while keeping space on client machines for
other files, such as MP3s or two OSes.</p><p>Although you may keep everything on the server, the standard
solution is to keep only the $HOME directories and documentations
there, including man pages and other documentation. Sharing by
means of NFS software that is used rarely and located typically
under /opt and /usr/local, is also a very good idea. Two
subdirectories should be shared via NFS: /usr/doc and
/usr/share.</p><p>Now, how do we use the mount parameters in these cases? As
discussed previously, the recommended options for $HOME are intr
and hard. In this case, you can be sure the data will not be lost.
For /usr/doc and similar subdirectories, however, this may not be
the optimal choice. If you access man pages while the Net is
overloaded, or even if the NFS server is down, your machine will
wait until it is able to re-establish contact with your NFS server.
In this case, using the soft option is better; the disconnect
message will appear on the screen and the operation will be
canceled. This option may be useful for noncritical data of any
kind, including news and FTP directories. However, the standard
choice is not to access /var/mail and /var/news via NFS; use
special protocols such as imap, pop and nntp.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ec580.0x19dcf98"></a>Improving the NFS Connection</h2></div></div><p>If you are concerned about the speed of the NFS connection,
you also can play with the rsize and wsize options. The default
size is set by the kernel and may or may not fit. For instance,
either your Ethernet card or the kernel is not able to handle large
blocks, something that usually happens with old hardware and old
kernels. If you have a newer card, a larger size might help you
reach better performance. In some cases you can increase the speed
by five or more times, but you have to do some experiments with
your network.</p><p>The easiest way of calculating the speed is to create a file
located on NFS volume and find the time of creating. This is just
an experimental file that may hold any kind of data, including zero
sequence, so we will create it by means of the dd command, using
/dev/zero as the source file. Command time calculates time of
creating.</p><p>How large should the temporary file be? The rule is to have
two or three times the size of the memory on the server machine. If
you have 2MB of RAM there, the file should be 4MB. Sometimes it is
hard to find a place for a such file, but in many cases 256MB on
your NFS disk machine should be fine. To calculate the free area on
your disk, use the command df. Then, assuming you are working on a
client machine, unmount it and mount again, put the magic value
1,024 for rsize and wsize parameters. Then execute the dd command
with time:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
time dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/tempo bs=16k count=16384
</pre><p>We use /dev/zero as the source for /home/tempo in order to
avoid calculating the time of reading the source. This command
sends 16,384 16KB blocks of null bytes, creating a file with a
total size of 16,000 bytes &times; 16,384/1024 kilobytes = 256
kilobytes or 256MB. Write the time down. Then calculate the time of
reading, sending the file to /dev/null:
<pre     class="programlisting">
time dd if=/home/tempo of=/dev/null bs=16k
</pre>


Record the time of reading, and then delete the temporary file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rm /home/tempo verbatim
</pre>


Repeat the describing procedure at least three times and calculate
the average reading/writing time. Unmount your client host:
<pre     class="programlisting">
umount /home verbatim
</pre>


Make sure you have NFS unmounted; it complains if there are errors
and keeps silent if not. Then mount it again, using the new value
2,048 for rsize and wsize, and repeat the procedure above, again
and again, up to 32,768.
</p><p>Observe the result. The faster the transferring, the shorter
the time. Find your optimal value and put it into /ets/fstab. Keep
the paper with the calculations in a safe place.</p><p>There are also a few tips to help you make this list shorter.
If you have a new network card and are sure your NFS server runs
version 3, you may start from the value 32,768 and go down. This
value should not be tested with NFS server version 2, however,
since it only works with older kernels and some Solaris and SunOS
machines.</p><p>We found the best result for kernel 2.2.19 to be value 4,096,
so you may start from it and try the nearest, 2,048 and 8,192. For
the new kernel, this value (in our case) was 8,192, but very often
kernel 2.2.19 worked better in comparison with 2.4.6. It strongly
depends on your hardware, so be very careful if you want to switch
your NFS server into new kernel release.</p><p>The optimal value for client machines that use NFS over
TCP/IP is 1,024 or less. This value also works if you have a router
between a client and the NFS server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18ec580.0x19dd468"></a>A Word about NFS Versions</h2></div></div><p>While the mount command for the NFS filesystem is working,
the version of the protocol is being recognized and a warning
message may appear on the screen. Usually it says the NFS version
of the server is older than the kernel mechanism.</p><p>The idea of sharing files through the Net is as old as the
Net itself, so there are concurrent solutions lists. To improve NFS
try version 4, or NFSv4 for short, which was introduced in the year
2000. The inventor of NFS, Sun Microsystems, is a sponsor for the
Linux NFSv4 Project. It has, of course, all the features of
previous releases but supports security by extending the basic RPC
security mechanism, so the weakest point of the previous version
has been solved. The other weak point, lack of
internationalization, does not exist anymore. Speed of transferring
has improved due to caching. We also can avoid those procedures of
calculating the optimal parameters because the new mechanisms of
improving access are supported. Putting this version into practice
means going without dust and noise&mdash;nowadays the Linux NFSv3 server
supports file locking&mdash;an NFSv4 feature.</p><p>So, don't forget about the old vine on the Net, NFS. It is
still not the vinegar of history.</p><p><a href="4880s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
