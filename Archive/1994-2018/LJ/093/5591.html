    A cruise to the land of lunacy, or Survivor geek style?

geeky if you can keep the sand out of your laptop. Of the many
cruises organized by Geek Cruises, this was the first one devoted
to Linux. <i  >Linux Journal</i> had the opportunity of
cosponsorship, and it's something we look forward to repeating next
year.</p><p>Besides being treated to intimate sessions and abundant
chances for one-on-ones with some of the most prominent names in
the Linux community, for us the cruise was a chance to get to know
many of our readers (and even some of their families).</p><p>The geek sessions were balanced very well with time off in
some fabulous ports of call&mdash;well, except Puerto Rico. But even
there, Geek Cruise organizer, &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; Neil Bauman, arranged a
special excursion for geek cruisers to see the home of the world's
largest single-dish radio telescope, the Aricebo Observatory, where
much of the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>Contact</em></span> was filmed, and
where scientists from around the world study things out of this
world 24 hours a day, 365 days per year.</p><p>Of course we weren't so lucky in choosing the lunch
restaurant that day. It was a buffet that ran out of food after
half of us had made it through the line. Fortunately, the
entertainment value of seeing Richard Stallman spill his soda
(accidentally of course) on the world's largest baby who was
sleeping in his playpen near the cash register was some
compensation for my hunger. I couldn't help but laugh
internally&mdash;the irony was too much, but I actually felt more sorry
for Richard than the baby; he felt so badly about it. In some
cosmic form of retribution my own two-year-old daughter spilled her
soda (same flavor as Richard's) all over my lap, leaving me looking
as if the excitement of the observatory was too much.</p><p>In contrast to Puerto Rico, the other ports of call were
absolute representations of paradise. At our last stop,
Holland-America's private island, Half Moon Cay, I rented a Sunfish
sailboat with my eight-year-old daughter, Genevi&eacute;ve. We
sailed to the end of the bay and still could see straight to the
ocean floor. For someone used to sailing the dark water of
Washington's Puget Sound, it was a unique experience.</p><p>Next year's Linux Lunacy cruise is rumored to be planned for
the Pacific, down Mexico way. Bring your sense of humor, your
goodwill and join us!</p></div></div>
