    Rick takes a look at a pair of recent announcements ofinteresting new gadgets with Linux embedded inside.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e78580.0x1f70500"></a></h2></div></div><p>GITWiT (Kirkland, Washington) is
currently developing a Linux-based wireless handset that combines
communications and entertainment within a uniquely customizable
two-part design. The company plans to aim the device at the
lucrative teen market initially by offering a colorful phone with
cool teen-oriented capabilities.
</p><p>According to GITWiT's market research, roughly 25% of the 40
million teens in the US own wireless phones today, leaving 30
million potential additional subscribers up for grabs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e78580.0x1f70660"></a>The How and Why of a Two-Part Phone
Design</h2></div></div><p>Physically, the GITWiT phone consists of two pieces (see
photo). The GITWiT-enabled handset contains the core telephony
functionality. A software-enabled cover, called a Smart Skin, snaps
onto the handset core to define a specific and easily alterable
look, feel and wireless-user experience.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5580f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
GITWiT Phone's Two-Part Design
</p></div></div><p>Each Smart Skin contains a Smart Key, which is built around
an industry standard, secure smart card module. Smart Keys contain
encrypted data and software that changes the wireless-user
experience to match the theme of the skin.</p><p>As an example, users snapping on skins branded by their
favorite music group might get a new look and feel for the user
interface, plus customized ring tones and graphics, preconfigured
wireless web bookmarks and subscription content for the group's
latest CDs and upcoming concerts.</p><p>GITWiT expects its innovative approach to be popular with
wireless carriers because it permits them to embrace changing
fashion and entertainment trends rapidly by refreshing the
relatively expensive core cellular component with an inexpensive
snap-on Smart Skin.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e78580.0x1f70a28"></a>Under the Hood</h2></div></div><p>From a technical perspective, GITWiT-enabled handsets are
composed of three main parts: a cellular processor, a proprietary
Smart Key operating system and an embedded host processor.</p><p>The host processor, an embedded computer running Linux, is
the heart of the phone. It is built around an ARM7 microprocessor
and contains a number of embedded peripherals and I/O interfaces
for the keypad, color LCD and for communicating with the Smart
Skins. A separate cellular processor handles all of the on-air
cellular communications.</p><p>GITWiT uses the 2.4.5 Linux kernel with ARM patches from
Russell King and Nicolas Pitre, as well as a number of in-house
patches. The system software also includes portions of Microwindows
for its GUI, as well as BusyBox.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e78580.0x1f70be0"></a>Why Linux?</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;We chose Linux for a number of reasons&rdquo;, explains GITWiT VP
of Engineering Peter Zatloukal. He continues:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We are building a user interface that is leagues
beyond what exists on current wireless phones, and Linux provides
us with a rich environment with which to render our ideas.
</p><p>Also, since most of our development work is in the
application and object layers, we're glad to be using an
open-source kernel so that we can contribute to efforts that make
it easier for others to develop embedded solutions.</p><p>We feel that increasing the ease of innovation in the
embedded space, even if it also strengthens our competitors, helps
us because it broadens the whole market. We like the world where
low barriers to entry fuel competition around what really
matters&mdash;a richer wireless-user experience.</p></blockquote></div><p>See <a href="http://www.GITWiT.com" target="_self">www.GITWiT.com</a>

WatchPad</h2></div></div><p>IBM Research and Citizen Watch have announced a collaboration
through which Linux-based WatchPad prototypes and related
technologies are being developed. The collaborative project, which
builds on IBM's earlier Linux Watch efforts, has the goal of
exploring a new type of personal information access devices for the
pervasive computing era. IBM Research first demonstrated the Linux
Watch last year, in an effort to illustrate the viability of Linux
across all platforms, from the S/390 to the smallest intelligent
devices.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5580f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
The IBM/Citizen WatchPad
</p></div></div><p>Citizen Watch decided to work with IBM to develop enhanced
features and new technologies for use in future &ldquo;intelligent
watches&rdquo;, such as using them as communication devices. Thus far,
Citizen Watch has contributed packaging and component design,
including display and input device. IBM provided the hardware
architecture, system design and software&mdash;including Linux. The two
companies also say they plan to collaborate with universities by
sharing the WatchPad technology for joint research, in hopes of
accelerating progress in the development of next-generation
intelligent devices.</p><p>The WatchPad contains a high-speed, low-power 32-bit MPU,
16MB of Flash memory and a quarter-VGA (320 &times; 240 pixels)
LCD. Wireless connectivity includes both Bluetooth and infrared.
Users interact with the device through a touch panel, buttons and
modified winding knob. In addition, an accelerometer is embedded in
the device to explore the possibility of arm movement being used as
an input method.</p><p>Here are a few key technical specs of the WatchPad, taken
from a fact sheet distributed by IBM Research:</p><p>Hardware</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Size: 65mm &times; 46mm &times; 16mm</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Weight: 43g (without wrist band)</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>CPU: high-speed, low-power 32-bit MPU

(developer edition) Linux/Java PDA from developers beginning in
November 2001. The price for the developer model is $399 US, and it
includes 32MB DRAM and 16MB Flash.</p><p>The device is based on a 206MHz Intel StrongARM
system-on-chip processor, and it has a 3.5" 240 &times; 320-dot
pixel (quarter VGA) reflective TFT 65,536 color LCD with
touch-panel support and, of course, runs an embedded Linux
operating system. The software stack is based on Lineo's Embedix,
Trolltech's Qt Palmtop Environment, Opera's web browser and a
PersonalJava v1.2-compliant Java runtime environment. Two expansion
slots are provided: a secure digital (SD) card slot, used mainly
for Flash memory, plus a CompactFlash slot used for communications
interfaces, a digital camera attachment, Flash memory and
more.</p><p>A unique and highly desirable feature of the SL-5000D is its
full QWERTY keyboard, which is accessed by sliding the bottom
portion of the device downward. See
