book to which we have to give a good review, as it is seemingly
written to butter us up. Bob Toxen says most Linux distributions
install too many extra d&aelig;mons by default, he lists
privacy-violating web advertiser DoubleClick, Inc. as a security
issue, and he even uses
<a href="/" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/</a> as one of the
hosts in an example. We like him already.</p><p>We also have to like the concept of a big, fun workbook full
of things we can do to increase the security of our Linux systems
and how to prepare to get back up with minimum pain if they do get
compromised. So please resist the temptation to, after taking one
look at these 694 pages of cracks, sploits, bugs and
vulnerabilities, go home, unplug your Linux box from the Net and
crouch behind it with a shotgun. This book is here to help you, not
scare you, and you should be able to get through the most important
parts in a weekend. There's no cause for alarm, but no reason to be
smug either.</p><p>Do you really need this book? We'd like to be able to say you
only need it if you offer network services or develop software. In
the future, when Linux distributions start to be a little more
sensible about their default security policies, you might be able
to get by without this book, if you install a locked-down,
client-only configuration and subscribe to a mailing list for
occasional security updates and bug fixes. But in the future you'll
have an apartment on the Moon, too. This is still the wild and
wooly Linux scene of Earth, 2001, and every checklist network
feature printed on the side of the shrink-wrapped distribution
package means more work for you&mdash;something you'll have to secure or
remove.</p><p>Before we get to the good parts of <span   class="emphasis"><em>RWLS</em></span>,
let's start with the savage criticism, shall we? First of all, the
book mentions browser security but isn't up to the current state of
the art in privacy tools. It's good for Toxen to mention that
DoubleClick is a security risk, but setting up blackhole routes to
some of their servers just gives you something to maintain when
DoubleClick moves them. It isn't going to be as effective as making
your nameserver authoritative for the doubleclick.net domain or,
better yet, running a proxy. And there are better ways to manage
cookies than just linking .netscape/cookies to /dev/null.</p><p>However, this is basically a book for the system
administrator, so no big deal. Users can easily find browser
privacy hints&mdash;the hard part is locking down services. Strangely
enough, though, in Chapter 13 Toxen dismisses the entire network
time protocol (NTP) with the comment, &ldquo;Some people prefer NTP, but
it uses only UDP, which is too insecure.&rdquo; Instead of NTP, he
recommends using the older <span   class="bold"><b>netdate</b></span>
or <span   class="bold"><b>rdate</b></span> programs from
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> and manually calculating the
clock drift if a system gets cracked.</p><p>NTP has cryptographic authentication capabilities and, even
when used without authentication, will only let an attacker who
spoofs UDP packets fake out your computer clock v-e-r-y
s-l-o-w-l-y. Don't the advantages of having to-the-second
synchronized file modification times and log entries on all your
systems outweigh the risks of this difficult attack? Why make
yourself have to correct the logs when you can least afford the
time to do so?</p><p>Coming up with a reasonably secure NTP plan, though, is
something you should be able to do after you understand the
security principles explained in the rest of the book. Hints: use
authentication among your in-house NTP servers and those of
cooperative ISPs, friends or business associates; use more than one
trustworthy public time server; add a radio clock if you're
paranoid; and check your logs.</p><p>That's about it for the savage criticism. What you can expect
to like about this book is a bunch of configuration tweaks, coding
tips, preparatory measures to minimize the effects of an intrusion,
security philosophy, anecdotes, office politics and tips on how to
steal laptops at airports. The book seems to hop around a little,
but it's not like you're reading some free-form brain dump here; if
you're doing security, you really do have to think about things at
more than one level at a time. Toxen's &ldquo;knucklehead with a laptop
and a phone line&rdquo; who does an end run around the firewall could be
anybody&mdash;a home user on DSL, or a traveling user who checks into
the Embassy Suites in Las Vegas (which I personally recommend if
you're ever in Las Vegas) and plugs into the &ldquo;High Speed Internet
Access in Your Room Only $9.95&rdquo;.</p><p>If your organization depends mostly on a firewall for
security, the laptop scenario should give you the heebie-jeebies.
Toxen does discuss firewalling, but mainly concentrates on
host-based security&mdash;he points out that many threats come from
inside the organization. Early in the book, he introduces the
concept of an &ldquo;attack path&rdquo; which you, as the system
administrator, should design so that an intruder has to break
through as many difficult layers as possible on the path to root on
an important box. A firewall can be one step on the path, so he
does cover IP chains.</p><p>Web developers will get a lot of help from this book, both in
detail-minded advice about CGI and other web technologies, and in
architecture for web sites. Toxen's &ldquo;one-way credit card server&rdquo;
architecture, where a separate box keeps credit card data outside
the main commerce site database, is a cool idea and applicable to
other types of sensitive data, too. Defense in depth is the way to
go. Just because an evil recruiter can break in and get a list of
employee addresses shouldn't also mean she can see their Wasserman
test results or SAT scores.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>RWLS</em></span> gets a thumbs-up in the fun reading
department, too, especially the stories of how Toxen, as a
UC-Berkeley student, got and kept root on their BSD UNIX systems.
Organizationally, the sections are divided clearly enough so that
you can read the general stuff and the specifics about what you run
now, then read sections on other services as you add them or take
responsibility for them.</p><p>Unless you code and run an ambitious internet site on your
own, you probably won't be responsible for all the security tasks
covered in this book. It reveals just how broad of a field Linux
security really is. You'll certainly find things to go through and
check on your own system in order to cut your intrusion risks now,
and you'll also find thought-provoking reading for planning future
projects with security in mind.</p></div></div>
