    What's happening with Linux?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1685580.0x177d348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Let me get the punchline out of the way:
No, it hasn't!
</p><p>There, now we can get down to business. Recently, we have
seen Linux-related stocks hit all-time lows, an assortment of Linux
magazines die, Linux companies fold or cut back significantly and
other companies pull out of the Linux market.</p><p>What does this mean?</p><p>Well, rather than using my crystal ball, I am going to use
our eight years of experience within the Linux community and some
logic. I hope this will be almost as reliable as the old crystal
ball.</p><p>When Linus decided the world needed Linux, his decision was
based on the fact that he thought he could create something that
was needed, a work that offered something new to people around the
world. Time has shown he was right.</p><p>In 1993, when I decided the world needed <i  >Linux Journal</i>, it was because I believed in what Linus was
doing and felt there was a need to offer a professional journal to
help spread the word. Time and reader feedback has shown me I was
right.</p><p>So, what's with the current situation? First, take a look
outside the Linux community. Sun Microsystems stock that was
selling for $120 US per share is now selling for under $40
(actually under $20, but there was a two-for-one split). Apple
stock dropped from over $50 to around $25 in one day and, six
months later, is still in the low $20s. Cisco did a nosedive from
over $40 to under $20 in under two months. I could go on.</p><p>Now, while the stock market hasn't had a real winner lately,
not everything dropped 50% or more. What happened is investors got
scared and took money out of what they saw as speculative
investments and put it into more secure investments. Anything
associated with the dot-com racket was considered seriously
speculative and was hit extremely hard.</p><p>Don't believe me? Look at IBM. While everything else in
technology was going down, IBM was fine. Why? Because it is the
big, stable one.</p><p>Now, on the other end of the spectrum, let's look at Linux,
the new kid on the block. Microsoft says Linux is bad news. All the
venture capitalists who jumped on the Linux bandwagon backed off.
All the companies that decided they should expand into the Linux
space (that includes hardware, software and publishing) realized
they were out on a speculative limb and backed down. Thus, Linux is
the current victim of short-term desire for big profits.</p><p>This reminds me of a phone conversation I had back in the
mid-1980s. SSC used to teach a bunch of UNIX-related classes; that
is, a short class for managers, a nontechnical class, a class for
programmers and a class in C programming. I was talking to a person
about the C class. When he found out it contained a lot of
information about the UNIX C compiler, UNIX-related libraries, the
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> command and other software
unique to UNIX, he told me we could get a lot more students if we
took all that stuff out so MS-DOS users would want to attend. I
explained to him that SSC's focus was documentation and training
related to UNIX, not computers in general. He thought I was
crazy.</p><p>Well, maybe I was, and maybe I was crazy again when I decided
<i  >Linux Journal</i> was needed, but at least I feel
good about my insanity. Today, you see the people who got into
Linux for the money leaving town. Unfortunately, that means some
good people who believed in Linux but got into the venture capital
game are getting hurt. However, that doesn't discount the value of
Linux.</p><p>In fact, let's talk about the value of Linux. If this is a
real economic downturn rather than just money shifting around,
Linux becomes more valuable. For example, an article in the
May/June issue of our sister publication, <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i>, is about the US Postal Service using 7,200
Linux-based computers to read zip codes and write bar codes on
envelopes. That's 7,200 computers that didn't need licensing fees
paid for a proprietary operating system.</p><p>That's just one example. Look at the number of web servers in
the world. Every Linux-based web server is one less software
license. All this use of Linux shifts money from unnecessary
software licenses to other areas. Those areas could include
hardware, salaries or just plain savings.</p><p>Linux use continues to grow. If you don't believe that, start
counting web servers and embedded systems. Sure, the majority of
computer desktops don't run Linux, but that is actually the area
where Linux has the least penetration. Linux is doing fine. It will
continue to grow in use and value. It's too bad some Linux
believers got off track thinking the end goal was money rather than
world domination. This little shake-up should help us get back on
track.</p></div></div>
