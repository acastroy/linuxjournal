Possible</h2></div></div><p>Systran Internet Translation Technologies was born during the
Cold War when the US government wanted to translate a large
quantity of Russians texts quickly. At the end of the sixties, it
became a private company called Systran, located in La Jolla,
California.</p><p>In the nineties, Systran decided to dump the OS/390 running
under MVS and port the whole system to UNIX. By then, PCs had
become powerful enough to host the translation engines. An
automatic translator was used to migrate most of the assembly code
into C code.</p><p>The original port was made to Solaris, but they quickly
switched to cheaper hardware, PCs and Slackware (they've since
moved to Red Hat). The reasons for the choice of Linux were: it
runs on a variety of hardware; it provides all the tools a
developer may need; natural language processing uses large texts
requiring powerful tools; the translation engine uses a large set
of rules, hence the migration produced large C/C++ programs and
needed powerful tools such as Make and gcc/g++; clients like
AltaVista have a large audience and need a robust application on a
stable system; and cost.</p><p>To these can be added the fact that drivers for newer
hardware appear more quickly on Linux than on other platforms, and
it uses marginally less resources. Linux provides a homogeneous
configuration easy to replicate and is very scalable. Linux also
comes with a firewall, sendmail, Apache, modperl and PostgreSQL,
all of which are needed for Systran's on-line services
(<a href="http://www.systranlinks.com" target="_self">http://www.systranlinks.com/</a>,
<a href="http://www.systranet.com" target="_self">http://www.systranet.com/</a>).
Moreover, environments like GNOME or KDE make it possible to put
Linux in the hands of non-programmers as well. This is important
because a large number of the Systran staff are linguists rather
than programmers. Finally, POSIX compliance ensures that Systran
can port easily to other forms of UNIX.</p><p>Systran software is behind most of the automatic translation
done in the world. Clients include not only US government agencies
and European institutions, but also AltaVista, Microsoft, Apple,
Lycos and AOL.</p><p>Machine translation is at the confluence of linguistics and
computer science. Developing a product is simply translating into
computer language all the rules of human language. The main problem
is a linguistic one, since you need to start with an accurate
description of the languages concerned. There is a description of
the source language (the analysis phase) and one of the target
language (the synthesis phase).</p><p>The code is divided into four parts: 1) the analysis of the
source language; 2) the synthesis of the target language; 3) the
transfer rules; and 4) the common procedures to all translation
engines, i.e., memory management, command-line management,
dictionary lookup procedures, filters, pre-processing,
post-processing, etc.</p><p>The dictionaries used are very specific; they do not only
include the translation of the words (i.e., manger = to eat) but
also syntactic and lexical information, such as &ldquo;this verb is
transitive, it can be used in this specific context in which case
it means this.&rdquo; There are three kinds of dictionaries. The first
two are internal, one with simple word stems and the other with
complex or idiomatic expressions. The third is external. The latter
are created on-demand for a specific customer on a specific theme.
Systran also has resource files that contain the flexions for the
verbs or the declensions for languages that have them, as well as
specific priority rules for the external (customer) dictionary and
stylistic indications. All this is coded in C, although the newer
extensions generally are coded in C++.</p><p>In order to produce the rules, linguists use a graphical
interface coded in GTK. The data is stored in an ASCII file that
goes through a Perl program to generate the macroinstructions from
the data in the code. The dictionaries are built semiautomatically
using the rules discovered during the analysis of the language. A
unilingual master dictionary is created for each language;
terminology is entered, and Systran's tools automatically add the
relevant linguistic information on the base of tables. For example,
&ldquo;automatically&rdquo; would be recognized as an adverb because it ends
in &ldquo;ally&rdquo;. Bilingual dictionaries are then built by creating a
simple double-entry list, which will then retrieve the relevant
syntactic information from the master unilingual dictionary.</p><p>It is only at the last stage that the dictionaries are
compiled into binary format in order to increase processing speed
at runtime. When you clicked on the Translate button on AltaVista,
you probably never thought the process behind it was so
complex!</p><p>Systran is preparing a free Linux release with all the
features of the Systran Personal Windows edition.</p><p>&mdash;Thunus F., Director of Systran Luxembourg</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2088580.0x2180710"></a>NASA's JPL Builds War Game Simulator On
Linux</h2></div></div><p>The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of Pasadena, California
is one of the space program's major players. Managed for NASA by
the California Institute of Technology, JPL is the lead US center
for robotic exploration of the solar system and its spacecraft have
visited all known planets except Pluto. In addition to its work for
NASA, JPL conducts research and development projects for a variety
of federal agencies. One such project, the Corps Battle Simulation
(CBS) recently made the transition from VAX to Red Hat Linux
Version 7.0, resulting in a substantial increase in performance at
considerably reduced cost.</p><p>CBS has been used to train army officers in battle tactics
for over 15 years. Previously, it ran on VAX's most powerful
computer, a $100,000-plus 7800-series machine. However, due to the
steadily increasing intelligence and the addition of new features,
CBS reached its limitations on VAX. This made further innovation a
struggle and threatened to render the battle simulator obsolete
within a few years. As a result, the US Army's Simulation,
Training, and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM), in Orlando,
Florida asked JPL to port the software to Linux in order to
increase functionality while cutting cost.</p><p>After spending a man-year reconfiguring CBS source code, then
recompiling, testing and debugging, the team benchmarked the system
running on Linux with rewarding results. &ldquo;By porting CBS from VAX
to Linux, we have achieved far better performance at a much reduced
cost and have lots of extra capacity,&rdquo; says Jay Braun, a
simulation software technologist at JPL.</p><p>The additional capacity of Linux gives the CBS system more
room to expand. Terrain elevation, for instance, can now be modeled
at a very detailed level. Previously, attempting complex line of
sight calculations severely taxed VAX capabilities. Now,
high-fidelity maps are available on Linux that make simulations
more realistic, increasing the accuracy of the battle
scenarios.</p><p>CBS is running on a $4,000 PC with a 1.2 gigahertz AMD Athlon
processor. This Linux machine runs the largest CBS exercise almost
four times faster than the most powerful VAX without sacrificing
anything in model fidelity. Using the VAX, fidelity had to be
reduced in order to allow a simulation to progress at a one-to-one
game ratio, i.e., a virtual minute in the simulation requires a
real minute of execution time. Under Linux, however, one-to-one
scenarios can be achieved at the highest quality levels
available.</p><p>JPL has also made adjustments so that CBS has a 20-second
save time for the largest exercises and three seconds for small
exercises. This is an order of magnitude faster than on the old VAX
system. Under Linux the application can now represent almost 3GB of
virtual address space for each simulation. &ldquo;That's a big image!&rdquo;
says Braun. &ldquo;Our model has plenty of features that are pushing the
limits of Linux.&rdquo;</p><p>JPL will deliver the ported software in June of 2001. Braun
predicts that in the near future, the system will further advance
to a two-processor machine that can support additional simulations.
JPL is now shifting over to Red Hat Linux 7.1 with the new 2.4
kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2088580.0x2180a28"></a>Fine Print</h2></div></div><p>No text selections can be copied from this book to the

now, and about all that's changed is who comes after #1.</p><p>Recently Evans Data Corporation of Santa Cruz, California
asked 300 Linux developers which distributions they would select
for a web server or a web application server. The obvious answer
was Red Hat. Coming in second were SuSE and Mandrake, each with
21.8%. As the chart shows, though, the question for developers
really is &ldquo;Who would you select in addition to Red Hat?&rdquo; The
average number of additional choices was 1.3 (for a total of 2.3
choices). Caldera, Debian and FreeBSD weren't far behind SuSE and
Mandrake.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4692seeingred-chart.large.jpg"><img src="4692seeingred-chart.jpg"></a></div><p>The survey's table of contents is on the Web at Evan's site
