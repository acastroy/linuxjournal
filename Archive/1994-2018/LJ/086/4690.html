significant work than its size lets on. It attempts to do no less
than explain to the general reader what it's like to think, work,
create and play like a hacker. With so much confusion and bad press
around hackers, this is no small challenge. Pekka Himanen situates
the hacker worldview historically, contrasts it with the modern,
work-centered worldview and speculates on the contribution to
humanity the hacker ethic can make. Even if you consider yourself a
well-versed hacker, you'll enjoy reading about your spiritual roots
as well as the positive social implications of the hacker ethic. I
might just give copies to my family and friends so they better
understand why I live, work, sleep and believe the way I do.</p><p>This book stems out of a collaborative friendship between
Pekka Himanen, Linus Torvalds and Manuel Castells (philosopher,
hacker and sociologist, respectively). It's only fitting that a
book on the collaborative hacker ethic should in fact be jointly
written. Torvalds contributes the prologue, presenting in a
nutshell what makes hackers tick. Himanen writes the largest,
middle section. And finally, Castells' epilogue rounds out the book
with a discussion on the information age's social implications.
Well researched endnotes and bibliography are included.</p><p>To explain why hackers would work together without pay to
make something like Linux, Torvalds pens &ldquo;Linus's Law&rdquo;. With
tongue somewhat in cheek, Linus's Law posits progress and evolution
as upward motion along a hierarchy of motivations: from survival,
to social life, to entertainment. What makes hackers tick,
according to Torvalds, is this last and most sublime motivation. By
entertainment, he's not thinking of games so much as &ldquo;the mental
gymnastics involved in trying to explain the universe&rdquo;, whether
you're Einstein, an artist or a hacker. Coding an operating system
is, after all, a great deal like explaining the universe because
one codifies the parameters and elemental models of everything that
can happen. Torvalds means entertainment to encompass the passion
and playfulness of activities intrinsically interesting and
challenging&mdash;stuff we stay up late working on because we love doing
it, not because of a deadline.</p><p>Wasting no time, Himanen makes the distinction in his first
paragraph between hackers and crackers. Readers are to understand
that it is only the latter who use computers to commit crimes,
bring down e-commerce, produce viruses and generally sow mayhem. By
&ldquo;hacker&rdquo;, Himanen means those who &ldquo;program enthusiastically&rdquo;
and who believe, as Eric Raymond describes in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Jargon
File</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon" target="_self">http://www.catb.org/jargon/</a>),
that &ldquo;information sharing is a powerful positive good, and that it
is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing
free software and facilitating access to information and to
computing resources whenever possible.&rdquo; Maybe the lines can't be
so easily drawn. I'm prone to think that cracking a system's
security can sometimes be an ethical, populist act. Himanen does
concede that &ldquo;most computer hackers support only some parts&rdquo; of
the general ethic he's describing. Still, it is fair to assume with
Himanen that a general, cohesive hacker ethic and its effects can
be clearly discussed. It is to Himanen's credit that he can
meaningfully characterize a group largely defined by the primacy it
grants to independent thought.</p><p>How does Himanen bring readers into the hacker's world? He
starts by looking at hackers' relationship to a cultural universal:
work. To describe the hacker work ethic, Himanen uses as a
counterpoint a landmark treatise on modern work and culture. What
Max Weber described in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Protestant Ethic and the
Spirit of Capitalism</em></span> is so much a part of our way of
experiencing work now that it seems as if things must have always
been so. Calling attention to our modern work ethic feels almost
like pointing at the air around us, until you realize that this
pervasive work ethic has all but suffocated us. In contrast, the
hacker ethic is a deep breath of fresh air. As Himanen refers to
Weber, he shows us that before the Reformation, attitudes about
work and its cultural importance were quite different and came to
change with the spread of the Protestant business model. The hacker
work ethic has potentially the same possibility to culturally
affect the experience of work. At the very least, the hacker work
ethic insists on there being an alternative mode of experiencing
work. Himanen makes the case that in this information economy, the
hacker's mode of work is also pragmatically superior to the
protestant work ethic: &ldquo;The information economy's most important
source of productivity is creativity, and it is not possible to
create interesting things in a constant hurry or in a regulated
manner from nine to five.&rdquo; Workers can't freely and creatively
pursue the projects of their passions if they are busy jumping
through hoops and punching a clock several times a day.</p><p>As the hacker ethic extends into the social and political
arenas, Himanen isolates expression and privacy as the core hacker
ideals in the public sphere, particularly on the Net. They hold
importance because they are vital in the resistance to exterior
regimentation and over-management. In the public sphere those
forces come from government and business. Government regulation and
control of expression, however well-intentioned at the outset, will
always contribute to the message that individuals are not mature
enough to use communication without guidance and supervision. The
worker who cannot work without supervision also cannot participate
unsupervised in the public sphere. With privacy unguarded, private
businesses can and do construct intimate and complete consumer
profiles of individuals that are then for sale to the highest
bidder. In this way it's possible to scrutinize the lifestyles of
workers and job applicants. The message here is either you're not
smart enough to be a good consumer on your own without our
guidance, or employers not only can regiment your work time, but
also have a say in how you spend your time away from work. Himanen
recounts stories of renowned hackers fighting for expression and
privacy in both small, peaceful ways and very dramatic ways, such
as in Kosovo where they played a decisive role in keeping free
expression alive.</p><p>The Epilogue by Manuel Castells ends the book with a densely
theoretical discussion of the societal forms he sees emerging from
the new economic infrastructure brought about by recent
technology&mdash;a novel application of the Marxist idea of
infrastructure determining cultural forms. Castells' portion of the
book was for me the most demanding and intellectually rewarding. He
convincingly shows how companies, industries and even nations are
functioning and structuring themselves like dynamic networks, where
workers and managers are constantly reprogramming themselves to
perform new tasks and new goals. In these networks, the real
employers of workers aren't companies so much as projects within a
network. As these networks become increasingly efficient and
object-oriented, a worker's relevance and permanency are guaranteed
only by his or her ability to self-reprogram. For most workers,
technology has mainly served to optimize the amount of useful work
that can be squeezed out of a day. Whereas Ben Franklin said &ldquo;Time
is money&rdquo;, now with the compression of time, Himanen writes that
&ldquo;even shorter units of time are money&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Hacker Ethic</em></span> offers not only an able
description of the hacker worldview, but also points to various
directions in which hackers can work to help counteract some of the
inhumane consequences of our network society. These directions
include integrating outsiders (back) into society's network through
widespread net access and education, initiating circles of hacker
creation where useful tools result from a mutual learning process,
aerating the experience of time for oneself and others to allow
more space for creativity and championing the causes of expression
and privacy.</p></div></div>
