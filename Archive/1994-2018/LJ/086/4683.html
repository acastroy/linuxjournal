    Marcel and his faithful assistant offer their usual unique spin
    on this month's feature topic.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a20580.0x2b18608"></a></h2></div></div><p> Fran&ccedil;ois, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>. I take it from your smiling face you have completed
your menu suggestions. I must tell you, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>, I was a little worried about letting you do this.
It is not easy for this chef to let his waiter come up with the
recipes for an entire issue, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? Come here,
and let me see what you have chosen.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu</em></span>! As I have told you many times,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, you are a wonderful waiter, but
sometimes...to tell the truth, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, you do
not know what is meant by &ldquo;internationalization and emerging
markets&rdquo;, do you? Aha, I did not think so. Why did you not ask?
Well, for one thing, emerging markets does not refer to stocks.
Fran&ccedil;ois, why are you not paying attention? What are you
looking at?</p><p>Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. Welcome to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>. Please, sit down. Be comfortable. I will have
Fran&ccedil;ois fetch some wine,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>. Fran&ccedil;ois, since
we are talking about the world, why not offer <span   class="emphasis"><em>nos
amis</em></span> a taste of Tuscany. Please, bring up the 1990
Olmaia from the cellar and do not fret, all will be well.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Non</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, do
not worry. It's just that Fran&ccedil;ois wanted to come up with
the menu for this issue on internationalization and emerging
markets, and I fear he should have asked what those terms meant. He
does have some interesting items on the menu, even if his
understanding is a bit off. To start with, he has come up with a
wonderfully simple little stock ticker program written by Tom
Poindexter. It is a Tcl/Tk program and requires version 8.0 of
Tcl/Tk or later. Other than that, it is a breeze to set up. Start
by getting the latest source from
<a href="http://www.nyx.net/~tpoindex/tcl.html#Tclticker" target="_self">www.nyx.net/~tpoindex/tcl.html#Tclticker</a>,
and unpack it in a temporary directory. There is one other small
thing I should mention. You must have an internet connection since
that is where the information comes from,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf tclticker-1.2.tar.gz
cd tclticker-1.2
</pre><p>Since this is a Tcl script, you do not need to compile
anything. In fact, you can use this as an example to explore Tcl
programming. By default, the program keeps its information in the
/lib directory directly beneath the home of the executable. Knowing
that, I run the program right from where it was extracted.
<pre     class="programlisting">
./tckticker &amp;
</pre>


<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4683f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Keeping Track of Your Stocks with TckTicker
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Wonderful, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? And so simple. To add
(or remove) stocks or indexes from the list you are watching,
simply click on the ticker and a Set Parameters window will appear
with a list of stock symbols that you can easily modify. There is
even a simple symbol lookup for when you know the name of the
company but nothing else. You can also change the speed at which
the information scrolls past with this parameters window.</p><p>If you are running KDE as your desktop manager, you could
actually have a constant source of information and news as your
desktop background itself. Right click on the desktop, and then
choose Configure Background. Now, look at that Background tab. You
should see a drop-down list, and in that list you should see an
option for Background Program.</p><p>While you are here, check out the kwebdesktop background
program. This (temporarily) brings us back to Fran&ccedil;ois'
thirst for news or stocks. Click Modify and look at the Command
definition:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
kwebdesktop %x %y %f http://www.kde.org/
</pre><p>What this will do is display a specific web page on your
desktop. You could decide on a page other than the KDE site.
Perhaps a national news web site or a financial information page,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? While the KDE page is wonderful to look
at, sometimes it may be more valuable to keep track of those
volatile investments.
</p><p>Stocks or emerging markets were not the only thing on
Fran&ccedil;ois' menu. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Non</em></span>, he decided that
some internationalization was in order. Since he does not get out
much, I am sorry to say, he decided to do his exploring from his
Linux desktop, taking advantage of the Mesa 3-D or OpenGL
libraries. In fact, the next two items on the menu both require 3-D
libraries to be installed. He started with a wonderful
visualization tool called Xplanet, created by Hari Nair.</p><p>Xplanet is inspired by the xearth screensaver program. It
makes use of photo-realistic images that can be obtained from
various sources. The package comes with a couple of NASA images
that are quite nice, including an &ldquo;Earth by night&rdquo; image that is
both breathtaking and frightening&mdash;breathtaking because it is so
beautiful, but frightening to those of us who still like the idea
of doing a little stargazing. Speaking of stargazing, the program
allows you to map other spherical maps as well. From the Xplanet
web site, there are links that will show you where to get different
views of this planet and others. Xplanet works in a screensaver
mode, as a background for your desktop, and it is dynamic.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4683f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Xplanet
</p></div></div><p>Start by picking up the latest source from the Xplanet site.
Then, extract it into a temporary directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf xplanet-0.80.tar.gz
cd xplanet-0.80
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>What Fran&ccedil;ois particularly likes is the fact that you
can use Xplanet to explore the planet. For this to work, your
system must have the Mesa 3-D libraries installed. If you call up
the program in the following manner, you can start on your journey:
<pre     class="programlisting">
xplanet -animate
</pre>


You should find yourself looking at a nice rotating globe of the
Earth. Using the Home and End keys allows you to zoom in and out.
The left and right cursor keys let you play with the rotation of
the planet, while the up and down keys change your viewing angle.
It's all very cool.
</p><p>In terms of using the program to explore, Xplanet also comes
with a nice Tcl interface called tkxplanet to let you change the
look, size, projection and so on, of your world. You can generate
the desktop or simply run the projection of your choice in a
window.</p><p>To run Xplanet as a background, you should be aware of some
differences depending on the desktop that you are running.
Different desktop managers treat their root windows differently.
With Window Maker and GNOME, for instance, all you have to do is
decide what kind of a view you want and enter it at the command
line&mdash;like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
xplanet -moonside
</pre><p>This will give you a nice background of the Earth as seen
from the Moon. If you try this with KDE 2.1, you might find that
nothing happens. That's because the control of the desktop is dealt
with somewhat differently, and this is where you define your
dynamic background. You might even notice that there is already an
entry for Xplanet. I took the original definition and modified it
to give me a different view of the world. Here's the program
definition from mine:
<pre     class="programlisting">
xplanet --geometry %xx%y -observer 49,60 --output %f.jpg &amp;&amp; mv %f.jpg %f
</pre>


What happens here is that the Xplanet program generates the map,
which is then saved to a background image, which is then written to
the desktop. The default refresh rate of ten minutes can be
modified to suit your tastes.
</p><p>For a nice 3-D visualization, we did have an additional
option on tonight's menu. Those of you who own your own personal
handheld GPS unit (global positioning system) may find this
particularly interesting. GPS3D is a system that lets your Linux
system communicate with the GPS to pinpoint your location on the
planet, superimpose downloaded maps on that same 3-D globe of the
Earth, map waypoints and view satellite trajectories. Currently,
the program only works with devices that support the NMEA series of
protocols (National Marine Electronics Association). To get your
copy, head over to
<a href="http://www.mgix.com/gps3d" target="_self">http://www.mgix.com/gps3d/</a>.
Then, extract and build the program from source (although binaries
are available):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bunzip2 gps3d-1.16.tar.bz2
tar -xvf gps3d-1.16.tar
cd gps3d-1.16
make
make install
</pre><p>The package includes a few programs, one of which is a
d&lt;\#230&gt;mon that listens for a serial-connected GPS device
and rebroadcasts the information to wherever you want. (Do you want
the world to beat a path to your door?) The included program that
interests us the most today, however, is called viz, and you can
also guess what it does, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?
<pre     class="programlisting">
./viz &amp;
</pre>


The great thing about this program is it provides some fun for
those who do not have their own GPS unit, by displaying a 3-D globe
that one can navigate, zoom in and out of and so on. While it
sounds like it would be much more fun with a GPS, this is still a
fascinating program and a good one to watch (see Figure 3).
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4683f3.large.jpg"><img src="4683f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. GPS3D lets you pinpoint your location on
the globe.</p></div></div>
</p><p>Perhaps one of the best ways to get to know how this world
works is to try running it yourself, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? At
least, that is what Fran&ccedil;ois thinks, based on the last item
on his menu. Before you run out the door and try to have yourself
elected dictator somewhere, why not relax and let my ambitious
waiter pour you a little bit more wine. I am not talking about
controlling the real world, but something better. A world of your
own making. A world where you can start from nothing and build
entire civilizations.</p><p>You may already be familiar with another version of this
game. I must tell you right now that <span   class="emphasis"><em>Freeciv</em></span>
is a different beast and worth your attention. The game can be
played across a network with up to 30 different players. If your
skills at world conquest are as good as mine, you may want to first
play a few games on your own. I tried very hard to build the
&ldquo;Despotism of Canada&rdquo; and failed on several occasions, even
though I populated my capital city of Ottawa with scientists
(Figure 4). Imagine.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4683f4.large.jpg"><img src="4683f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Marcel tries to build the Despotism of
Canada.</p></div></div>
</p><p>If you think you can do better than this chef, I invite you
download your own copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Freeciv</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.freeciv.org" target="_self">http://www.freeciv.org/</a>)
and begin building your empire by building the code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf freeciv-1.11.4.tar.gz
cd freeciv-1.11.4
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>It is all very easy. While this is all happening, why not try
the cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e. It is positively transcendent
tonight.
</p><p>The game consists of both a client
(<span   class="bold"><b>civclient</b></span>) and a server
(<span   class="bold"><b>civserver</b></span>). You start by running
a server and waiting for connections. The server itself is a text
screen with a command prompt. A number of options can be set here,
such as the size to which a city must grow before the people start
becoming unhappy, or for that matter, how much food is required for
the city to grow.</p><p>Players must start their client by typing
<b  >civclient</b>. The next step is to choose a country
and the name of the person who will lead this country. If you have
always dreamed of being Hannibal and running the Carthaginian
world, or Napoleon in France, then this is your big chance. When
you have enough players (one is sufficient), you can start the game
by typing <b  >start</b> at the civserver prompt.</p><p>Explore, expand, build, invade. Let Chef Marcel give you a
tip though. Too many scientists tend to work out better than too
many Elvises. Who would have known?</p><p>For those of you who feel a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu,
you are no doubt thinking this sounds an awful lot like a complex
version of a very old game called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hammurabi</em></span>.
For fun (and nostalgia), I decided to see if I could find this
ancient wonder of the gaming world. I located it at
ftp.sco.com/skunkware/src/games and compiled it on my Linux system.
This is a single source file called hammurabi.c, and you can
compile it like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cc hammurabi.c -o hammurabi
</pre><p>You can execute the resulting binary by typing
<b  >./hammurabi</b>. The result is something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
HAMMURABI . . .
    BUY HOW MANY ACRES?20
 *  YOU ARE BUYING 20 ACRES.
    HOW MANY BUSHELS SHALL WE DISTRIBUTE AS FOOD?2000
 *  YOU ARE DISTRIBUTING 2000 BUSHELS.
    HOW MANY ACRES SHALL WE PLANT?1000
--&gt; HAMMURABI! THINK AGAIN -- YOU ONLY HAVE
--&gt; 100 PEOPLE, 1020 ACRES, AND 420 BUSHELS
        IN STOREHOUSES.
    HOW MANY ACRES SHALL WE PLANT?
</pre>


Perhaps I had better stick to the restaurant business,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>? My attempts at ruling even a make-believe
world have been nothing short of disastrous. Still, they say
practice makes perfect. Why don't you all log in, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, and show me how it is done? And, never fear
Fran&ccedil;ois, you did a wonderful job with your first menu. Now,
refill our guests' glasses one last time before we close for the
night.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mes amis</em></span>, thank you for coming. Until
next time, please join us here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>.
Your table will be waiting. Of course, I may handle the next menu
myself.</p><p>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</p><p><a href="4683s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
