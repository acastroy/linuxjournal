somehow it seems that in a world filled with first-person shooters
and real-time strategy games, they've fallen through the cracks of
general popularity. Loki's Linux port of 3DO's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes of
Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia</em></span> sets
about to fix that little oversight with a vengeance in a game whose
addictive properties can, quite literally, suck you in until your
mouse-hand is spasming involuntarily and your eyeballs are glazed
and crusty. I mean it, if you believe you might have an addictive
personality, if you have someone in your household who might
actually want to speak with you in the next few days, if you don't
believe your boss will accept, &ldquo;...can't talk now...game...&rdquo; as a
valid sick-day excuse, think twice before sitting down to a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span> session. Fact is, it's the
turn-based nature of the game, the part of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes
III</em></span> that seems so benign on the surface compared to its
faster-paced cousins, that erodes your conscious mind and turns it
into a soft, pliable sludge. You begin thinking in terms of how you
only need a few more turns to set yourself up for a another small
battlefield victory or strategic advantage that leads to a new
perspective, a new strategy, which leads you to believe that only a
few more turns are needed to set yourself up for something else;
and so the vicious circle sucks you in as you hurl yourself onward
toward conquest (or sleep deprivation-induced insanity).
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span> is a game of strategy, chance,
tactics and luck; a mixture of some of the best elements from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chess</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>SimCity</em></span> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Warcraft</em></span> blended seamlessly into an RPG that
makes you the leader of armies of mortals and supernatural
creatures fighting against warlocks, wizards, warriors and witches
(and worse).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c36580.0x1d2ed40"></a>The Story</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes of Might and Magic III</em></span> is the
latest installment in the epic <span   class="emphasis"><em>Might and Magic</em></span>
universe of games and takes up where <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes
II</em></span>, the ninth title in the saga, leaves off. This time
you are on the continent of Erathia where a complicated tale of
murder and conquest unfolds as Catherine Ironfist seeks to
investigate the death of her father and restore Erathia to its
former glory. The story naturally unfolds through movies and
cut-scenes with narratives that explain each new situation in a
compelling and easy-to-follow format.</p><p>Basically, the idea is you control a cadre of &ldquo;heroes&rdquo;, the
game's main characters, as well as the settlements they conquer,
the resources they appropriate, the lands they explore, the armies
they command and the treasures they find. Your heroes' goals are
typically stereotypical <span   class="emphasis"><em>D&amp;D</em></span>-style
objectives (&ldquo;kill the golden dragon queen&rdquo; or &ldquo;find the grail
before your enemies do&rdquo;), and as they progress and mature, they
gain experience, new powers, skills, knowledge and new warriors to
take into battle. The scope of the game is nothing short of Homeric
at times; although you can choose to engage in shorter
single-player games if you wish, often even medium-sized quests
will last well into the small hours if you aren't careful and in
campaign mode. Your characters can grow and mature through a long
series of goal-oriented games to reach a final objective that may
take many days and nights to complete.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4684f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Exploring the Kingdom
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c36580.0x1d2f1b8"></a>Game Play</h2></div></div><p>As stated before, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span> is
turn-based; more specifically, each turn lasts for one Erathian
day. One day in which you are allowed to control each of your
heroes in any way they can be controlled (fighting, moving,
teaching, learning, exploring, acquiring resources, trading
resources, etc.); and manipulate the activities in the cities under
your control (build new buildings, recruit new warriors or heroes,
buy or sell merchandise or artifacts, etc.). When you're done with
your day's activities, you complete your turn, wait for your
opponents to complete their daily events (computer opponents take
only moments to make their moves) and then begin the next day's
events. Warrior resources in each city are replenished once per
week, so if you go out and lose most of your troops in a battle on
Monday, you'd better hope you can hold off your attackers for a
week with what you have left.</p><p>If you think the game sounds complicated, you're right, it
is. The learning curve is pretty steep and an intimate look at
every detail of the game requires a rather serious study of the
included 133-page manual. However, a 12-page PDF tutorial guide is
included on the CD, and the built-in tutorial mission takes only
about 45 minutes to complete. Afterward, one should have a very
solid command of the fundamental game options available and a firm
enough handle on the game's mechanics to jump into play and learn
the specifics. In fact, for all its complexity, the game interface
is intuitive enough that many players will likely find they can
head right into the tutorial game and learn enough in a few minutes
of poking around at the assorted controls to get themselves on the
right track and playing single-player games with relative ease.
What's more, the developers took into account the complexity of the
game and scattered contextual help liberally. Right-clicking on
virtually any place in the game will produce a pop-up window
describing in succinct detail the area, button or icon currently
under the pointer.</p><p>Game play focuses exclusively on the actions of the heroes
themselves and the cities under your control. Heroes are
responsible for exploring the areas around the cities, locating any
of the nearly 130 different artifacts available, finding resources
like mines or other sources of income for the city, as well as
battling to defend the cities from attack, conquering new cities
and fighting other heroes to expand your holdings. Cities produce
gold currency from resources you provide them, which you then use
to buy buildings and recruit heroes and warriors. Warriors provide
valuable services to your heroes and act as a clearing house for
all manner of soldiers or creatures your heroes may need in order
to beef up their armies.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4684f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. An Early Fortress Town
</p></div></div><p>The cities themselves come in eight different varieties and
are made up of dozens of individual structures, each customized for
the type of cities they are built in. For example, in the
&ldquo;Castle&rdquo; city-type, one will find buildings such as a guardhouse
(where pikemen can be recruited), a monastery, training grounds
(the favorite hangout of cavaliers) and even supernatural
structures like a holy &ldquo;Portal of Glory&rdquo;, where one can recruit
powerful Archangels for the right price. The flip side would
perhaps be the &ldquo;Inferno&rdquo; city-type, where such sinister
structures as fire lakes can be built to supply supernatural
Efreet, kennels built to supply Hell Hounds and the deadly
Cerberus, and even a &ldquo;Forsaken Palace&rdquo; from which Archdevils are
called into the service of your army. Other cities are homes to
wizards and genies, Pegasus and dwarves, even dragons and ogres. In
total, there are 118 different varieties of creatures at your
disposal, and each has specific attack characteristics and features
designed to facilitate various tactical roles on the battlefield,
from ranged attacks at a distance to close-quarters hand-to-hand
combat or anything in between. Each building has a specific cost
associated with its construction and some characters and buildings
can be used to supply materials or resources. For example,
blacksmiths can forge weapons; libraries can enhance the knowledge
of visiting heroes; mage towers can be used to teach visiting
heroes new spells and incantations; and new heroes can always be
found loitering in the local taverns, waiting to be hired to
command armies for your kingdom.</p><p>There are 128 different individual heroes, each with his or
her own unique traits, strengths and weaknesses. These heroes lead
your military might, exploring the lands with the armies you've
placed under their control, claiming resources for your kingdom and
protecting your sovereign territories from hostile invaders. Heroes
themselves do not participate in battles, but each has various
types of spells, knowledge and skills they can use to drastically
help the troops under their command. When in battle, a turn-based
combat begins and a close-up view of the hexagonal-grid battlefield
is presented, as shown in Figure 3.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4684f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Combat Screen
</p></div></div><p>Each side takes turns in combat until a victor is determined,
by either one hero vanquishing another's armies through total
destruction or by one side surrendering or retreating. In the case
of a surrender, the hero runs away in shame, and you'll have to
recruit him or her again to get them back into the service of your
army. In the case of a defeat or a retreat, the shame is simply too
great, and the hero will abandon your cause altogether. Victors of
combat receive experience points that will help them gain new
levels of maturity and learn new knowledge and skills that can help
them in battle or in exploration: skill in tactics can give you
free moves at the beginning of combat, skills in navigation can
help you move farther each turn while in a ship, skills in
diplomacy will help your heroes convince others they meet to join
their armies and so on. Combat against fortified cities takes place
in a special siege-combat screen, where an attacking hero's army
has to bombard and destroy a city's ramparts with catapults in
order to physically invade.</p><p>The graphics in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span> are superbly
detailed, colorful and complex. The various interfaces are
intuitive and ergonomic, which is fortunate since players will be
sitting spellbound and using them for significant fractions of
their waking moments. The sound effects and background music are
where <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span> really excels; the music
actually changes to fit the mood of the game and does it often, at
all the right moments. Exploring your kingdoms, you'll hear
classical symphonies and powerful soaring adventure music; go into
battle and the score changes to something more foreboding and
suspenseful. Head into a castle city and the music is an Arthurian
harpsichord concerto; head into a dungeon and the music is an eerie
melody with deep oboes and cathedral bells&mdash;you get the idea. The
music adds much to the ambience of the game and never seems to get
old or repetitive.</p><p>Multiplayer modes are, historically, one of the best parts of
turn-based games and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span>'s multiplayer
action is, unfortunately, still back somewhere in history. While
TCP/IP modes of play are available, no functionality exists for
connecting to any type of centralized, on-line community to manage
multiplayer games. You will need to find the IP address for your
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span> game host with some other method,
and then connect directly to it. Alternately, you can play &ldquo;hot
seat&rdquo; games, wherein one person sits in the hot seat and makes
their moves, gets up and lets the next person play. There is no
option to play by e-mail, like a lot of turn-based titles, so to
play in that fashion requires players to exchange hot seat files
(saved hot seat games) with each other in order to remotely do
turn-based, long-term gaming. In this reviewer's opinion, this is
really one of the only bad points about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes
III</em></span>, and an area that was sorely overlooked by
3DO.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c36580.0x1d2faa8"></a>Linux Notes</h2></div></div><p>Tested on a Matrox G400-based, 500MHz PIII system with 128MB
RAM, this game performed flawlessly. I suspect that it would
function quite well on a much lesser system as there is no
requirement for 3-D acceleration, and the calculations for combat
and movement really shouldn't be that complicated. Loki's
recommended minimums for the game are 32MB RAM and a Pentium 133.
You'll need an OSS-compatible sound card, as well as an X server
capable of doing 800 x 600 in 16-bit color. The install footprint
is highly customizable since the installer allows you to separate
out all the major components and leave in any of the scenarios,
sounds, graphics, music or videos on the CD if you like. This
allows <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span> to take up as little as 5MB
to as much as 350MB of your drive's real estate. Depending on how
much data you leave on the CD, you may need more than the
recommended minimum 4X CD-ROM drive; running the videos from such a
slow drive might cause some rather nasty stuttering/rebuffering. As
usual, Loki recommends at least any of the 2.2 kernels or above for
their game ports.</p><p>There are some small problems with the default install. For
instance, the version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span> that Loki
ships doesn't do full-screen mode by default (or at all as any user
other than root from what I could tell). However, Loki's single
upgrade patch is only about 1MB and fixes many small bugs,
including the full-screen mode problem, and is highly recommended
to be applied over the default install before playing.
Interestingly, this patch also includes hooks to AAlib, the ASCII
Art Library, which supposedly allows truly desperate
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span> players without X to get their fix
from the console in glorious ASCII detail. Additionally, Loki is
also offering a beta version of their <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes
III</em></span> map editor for Linux, which allows you to create
your own <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span> adventures. They are also
offering a free 17MB demo of the game from their web site,
<a href="http://www.lokigames.com" target="_self">http://www.lokigames.com/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c36580.0x1d266a8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Plain and simple, this game is exquisite: turn-based gaming
at its finest. The interface makes sense, even if you've never
played an RPG-type game before, and the quality of the workmanship,
attention to detail and overall polished feel of the game makes
everything seem to work the first time, the right way. Although the
game is rather complex, it's straightforward and more importantly,
fun to learn. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heroes III</em></span> is one of those games
that you sit down to tinker with and end up leaving your desk eight
hours later because you have to go to bed sometime. Highly
recommended for penguins of all ages.</p></div></div>
