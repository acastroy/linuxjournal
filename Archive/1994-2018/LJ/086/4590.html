 For this review, PogoLinux
(<a href="http://www.pogolinux.com" target="_self">pogolinux.com</a>) sent
me one of their new RAID workstations, the PogoLinux Velocity. The
system came configured with a 1GHz Athlon processor, 256MB of PC133
SDRAM and two IBM 45GB hard drives attached to a Promise ATA100
RAID card in a RAID 0 configuration.</p><p>For those that are unfamiliar with RAID, RAID stands for
redundant array of inexpensive disks. The idea is that one may
provide enhanced reliability or performance by using an array of
relatively inexpensive disk drives combined with a special hardware
or software controller. The three most common RAID configurations
are called RAID 0, RAID 1, and RAID 5. RAID 0, also known as
striping, is the division of data between drives such that a single
read or write operation may combine data from two or more hard
drives, thus increasing the aggregate transfer rate. RAID 1, also
known as mirroring, does the opposite of RAID 0: instead of
focusing on performance, RAID 1 focuses on increasing reliability
by storing multiple copies of your data on different drives, thus
reducing the chance of a drive failure destroying your data. I
opted to have the workstation preconfigured with RAID 0 for the
enhanced performance.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x164f580.0x1747d98"></a>Setup and Initial Impressions</h2></div></div><p>Setting up the Velocity was a breeze: five minutes to get it
out of the box and onto my desk and another ten to boot it up and
configure it to talk to the network. Those of you who will want to
add custom hardware such as a preferred graphics board, gigabit
Ethernet or a DVD drive will appreciate the Velocity's
maintenance-friendly case with just two thumbscrews between you and
the motherboard. Red Hat 7 will recognize most third-party hardware
without problems.</p><p>There are two big issues to be aware of before you set up the
system. One is that the default Red Hat 7 has a long list of known
problems, and because of this you may have trouble getting some
applications to run properly. The other major issue that I ran into
is that the kernel needs special parameters to boot properly from
the Promise RAID hardware. This only becomes an issue if you want
to replace the kernel or install an alternative Linux distribution;
Pogo's default configuration works fine. The usual symptom is a
kernel panic when the kernel attempts to mount partitions, but the
fix is simply to provide the kernel with the correct I/O addresses.
For a detailed explanation of how to do this see Aaron Cline's
&ldquo;Unofficial Asus A7V and Linux ATA100 Quasi-Mini-Howto&rdquo; at
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/ender7007" target="_self">http://www.geocities.com/ender7007/</a>.
Once the machine recognizes the card no further configuration is
necessary to take advantage of the RAID controller, and other than
the issues just mentioned, I had no problems with setup.</p><p>My overall first impression is that the Velocity is a very
speedy machine&mdash;as one would expect from any 1GHz Athlon box&mdash;and
fairly well put together. As someone who frequently swaps hardware
out of my machines I also appreciate the ease of opening the case
via the thumbscrew-attached side panels. Having set up the machine
and played with it for a little bit, it is time to measure how fast
the Velocity really is.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x164f580.0x1747fa8"></a>The Benchmarks</h2></div></div><p>For these benchmarks, the PogoLinux RAID box in RAID 0 mode
will be compared to a similarly configured non-RAID system, same
motherboard and processor (well, A7Pro vs. A7V), same RAM and a
similar ATA 100 drive (but just one for the non-RAID
system).</p><p><a href="4590l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. PogoLinux Velocity (RAID
0)</a></p><p><a href="4590l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Single Disk
System</a></p><p>Using the Bonnie benchmark suite, the PogoLinux box produced
some interesting results. Tests that performed large numbers of
very small disk transactions did very poorly on the PogoLinux RAID
box&mdash;about half as fast as the comparison system&mdash;while tests that
rely on fewer transactions involving larger amounts of data did
much better, right in the middle of the 40-50MB/s transfer rate
quoted by PogoLinux. This information is very important when one is
considering the purchase of approximately $1,578 worth of hardware.
So, on to a real-world test.</p><p>To compile Mozilla, use the time command for measurement, as
shown in Table 1.</p><p><a href="4590t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Times (mm:ss.s) and
Improvement (%)</a></p><p>In most applications, the RAID system didn't perform
noticeably differently from the single drive system. Some tasks,
such as untarring Mozilla, actually came out slower on the RAID
system. Compiling Mozilla was only faster by about ten seconds out
of 50 minutes. This is indicative of a near-universal truth in
computing: aggregation can buy you increased bandwidth, but it
can't buy decreased latency. The likely explanation for why the
RAID 0 system has relatively poor performance when performing many
small accesses is rather lengthy, but suffice it to say that it is
related to the fact that having to wait for two read/write heads
instead of one increases the array's average seek time.</p><p>What this means in the real world is that having a RAID 0
disk system will only accelerate tasks where large amounts of
contiguous data is transferred (where increased transfer rates
help) and not tasks that require many small disk accesses (where
disk latency is more important than transfer rate). One good
example of this is working with applications that use large data
files, such as editing high-resolution photos in the GIMP, where I
did indeed notice significant improvement in loading and saving
large files.</p><p>Other tasks that benefit from increased disk transfer rates
include database searches, video editing or any type of
high-bandwidth data capture (i.e., direct-to-disk audio and video).
Tasks that won't benefit from RAID 0 (especially as opposed to
having two drives operating independently) include file servers
serving many concurrent users making small requests, database
servers supporting similar workloads, most general-purpose
applications and development software, etc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x164f580.0x1748478"></a>The Bottom Line</h2></div></div><p>For many users' purposes, a RAID 0 system will provide less
performance benefit than spending the equivalent money on getting a
single fast hard drive, faster processor, more RAM or a faster
motherboard. The price difference between PogoLinux's Velocity
workstation and a similarly configured workstation without RAID,
such as PogoLinux's Altura workstation, is about $300 if you still
buy another 45GB IBM hard drive. For $300 you can buy a 1.2GHz
Athlon (instead of 1.0), an extra 256MB of RAM (or an extra 512MB
if you stretch it to $370) or a 64MB GeForce2 GTS (instead of the
included 32MB MX). On the other hand, if you really need the
maximum throughput for working with large files or the reliability
of a RAID 1 configuration, the RAID system is definitely the way to
go.</p><p><a href="4590s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
