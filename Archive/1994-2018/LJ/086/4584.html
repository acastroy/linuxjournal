    Matthew highlights his experience installing Linux and compiling
    software on his new Apple G4.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd5580.0xecd558"></a></h2></div></div><p>When I first read about Apple's plans to
develop a G4-based personal computer, I didn't even know what a G4
was. Supercomputer performance? Processing in the GFlops? How could
this be? G4, also known as the Motorola 7400, is the processor with
the AltiVec unit. AltiVec is the trade name of the vector
processing unit found in this new line of PowerPC processors.
Motorola has also announced the 7410 and the 7450, which feature an
L2 cache on the die, a large backside L3 cache, a faster processor
core and a deeper, seven-stage pipeline.
</p><p>The AltiVec unit is an enhanced integer or floating
processing unit. It provides a new 128-bit processing unit, 32
vector registers and over 160 new instructions that allow for the
processing of data in a pipeline. These provide a tremendous
opportunity to move data through the processor.</p><p>After a description like that, who wouldn't want to have one
of these at home? I'm not a Macintosh aficinado nor do I care for
Windows very much. When I read about the work that Cort Dugan, Paul
Mackerras, Ben Herrenschmidt and many others had performed porting
Linux to PowerPC (PPC) I was sold. After all, this sounded like an
opportunity to try something new and challenging, learn a little
(or a lot) and get faster numbers from my distributed.net client
(some of the reasons I started using Linux last millennium).</p><p>My hardware is an Apple dual-G4/450MHz PowerPC with 512MB
RAM. It comes with a 30GB Quantum Fireball IDE drive, a CD/DVD-ROM,
two IEEE-1394 (Firewire interfaces), 100Mbps Ethernet and more USB
hubs than you can shake a stick at. The keyboard and mouse are both
USB devices. Apple calls this a New World machine. Although this
sounds like a marketing term, &ldquo;New World&rdquo; is used to describe
Apple hardware where the boot ROM is stored in software (as opposed
to &ldquo;Old World&rdquo; machines where boot management software was stored
in a PROM).</p><p>The Linux distribution I chose to install was Yellow Dog
Linux. I don't know what finally pushed me in that direction, given
that there is more than one choice&mdash;SuSE, LinuxPPC and Yellow Dog
Linux immediately come to mind. YDL is based on Red Hat, so it's
not too unfamiliar.</p><p>YDL is provided by Terra Soft Solutions. While Terra Soft
provides another distribution, Black Lab Linux, YDL is the entry
point solution for the common user. I downloaded the two ISO images
of YDL Champion Server 1.2.1 from one of Terra Soft's mirrors. The
first is the installation CD; the second CD is known as &ldquo;Tasty
Morsels&rdquo;. It provides a rescue image and some additional software
for the PPC. I burned these images with
<span   class="bold"><b>cdrecord</b></span> on my SuSE/i386 box and
then wondered what I had.</p><p>After I read the YDL installation guide I had some idea. The
guide suggested I use <span   class="bold"><b>yaboot</b></span>,
&ldquo;yet another boot loader&rdquo;. yaboot needs to live on an HFS (native
Mac) partition so I needed to create one using the Mac system
software.</p><p>Here are the steps I used to reinstall Mac OS9 and then
install Linux:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Create an HFS partition (4GB) for yaboot (and
OS9).</p></li><li><p>Reinstall OS9 from distribution CDs.</p></li><li><p>From the CS 1.2.1 CD, copy yaboot, yaboot.conf and
vmlinux.gz to the system folder.</p></li></ul></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>yaboot.conf</b></span> looks and feels
a lot like lilo.conf. There are sections for each image with an
area to provide a label so that when yaboot boots, the user can Tab
to see the names of the kernel configurations and then select one
at the prompt. Familiar stuff, but I had to modify yaboot.conf as
shown below.
</p><p>Here I should digress a bit about Open Firmware. Open
Firmware, defined under IEEE 1275, is a specification for providing
open support for firmware. This was one of the first interesting
areas of my new Apple hardware explorations. I didn't see Open
Firmware until I needed to. Upon booting the Mac an 880Hz tone
sounds to indicates that your system just passed a hardware POST
and is preparing to boot an operating system. At this point the
booting process can be stopped by pressing and holding the
Command-Opt-O-F keys. If all goes well the following greeting is
displayed:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Apple PowerMac 3,3 3.4f1 BootROM built on
08/08/00 at 22:02:19
Copyright 1994-2000 Apple Computer, Inc.
Welcome to Open Firmware.
To continue booting, type "mac-boot"
and press return
To shut down, type "shut-down"
and press return
 ok
0 &gt; _
</pre><p>The 0 &gt; is a prompt. OF is, at its heart, a Forth
interpreter. Forth is a stack-based language. To obtain a sense of
this, type the following at the prompt:
<pre     class="programlisting">
0 &gt; 3 [RETURN]
1 &gt; 4 [RETURN]
2 &gt; + [RETURN]
1 &gt; . [RETURN]
</pre>


and you will get the resulting:
<pre     class="programlisting">
0 &gt; 7
</pre>


The first command pushed &ldquo;3&rdquo; on the stack. The prompt displays
the number of items on the stack before the &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo;. Then I placed
&ldquo;4&rdquo; on the stack and told the interpreter to add the results. Now
there was only one item on the stack. The &ldquo;.&rdquo; operator pops the
first value off of the stack and displays it.
</p><p>You can see quite a bit about your hardware from here. For
example, to see the default boot configuration of your machine type
the following at the prompt:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0 &gt; printenv
</pre><p>Listing 1 shows the built-in environment variables and their
defaults.
</p><p><a href="4584l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Environment Variables and
Their Defaults from the G4's Open Fireware</a></p><p>Another good bit of information from your PPC can be derived
from the command <span   class="bold"><b>devalias</b></span>. Enter
this command at the prompt and press the Return key. Pay attention
to the value for hd. That is the hardware address of your first IDE
hard drive. hd is an alias for the entire address displayed via
<span   class="bold"><b>printenv</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd5580.0xece108"></a>Saving This Information (More Fun with
Forth)</h2></div></div><p>If you are like me, you might get paranoid about changing any
of these values. After a bit of research on
<a href="http://developer.apple.com" target="_self">http://developer.apple.com/</a>,
I came across some interesting technical notes. In particular were
Technotes 2000-2004. Some of the benefit of having a full-featured
interpreter with the power of an operating system is the ability to
provide for viewing, running files and displaying hardware
information for debugging. Much of this information is too detailed
to write down, so there is the notion of a &ldquo;two-machine&rdquo; mode (TN
2004). In this mode, you can display the OF output on a serial
port. The G4 PPC doesn't come with a serial port, but within
Apple's OF there is a Telnet d&aelig;mon. I'm not entirely sure
that you couldn't use the USB devices as output, after all,
&ldquo;serial&rdquo; is in the acronym, but I do know that the Telnet
d&aelig;mon works. Also, I don't know if minicom can be used with a
USB port.</p><p>The d&aelig;mon is easily configured. First, from the OF
prompt enter the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0 &gt; " enet:telnet, 192.168.2.20" io
</pre><p>Observe the spaces, press Return and now OF has created a
Telnet d&aelig;mon awaiting a Telnet client. This command has
configured the Ethernet interface to IP address 192.168.2.20. You
may want to choose a different IP address depending on your own
network configuration. You will need another machine on the same
physical network segment as your PPC. If you don't have a segment,
a crossover Ethernet cable will do.
</p><p>From your client machine, Telnet to your target (PPC)
machine. You should be presented with the same &ldquo;0 &gt;&rdquo; prompt as
displayed from the Mac. Now you have the ability to capture all of
the output from printenv, devalias, etc., to a file. This helps if
you screw things up so badly that you have to return to your
default configuration.</p><p>Okay, let's install Linux. Insert the YDL CD into your DVD
ROM and hold the C key down while you boot. This is the method to
boot from the CD. You'll be presented with the installation screen
for YDL. You can follow the YDL installation guide for the most
part, but a word of caution about partitioning: unless you've
installed Linux before on your Mac, you'll need to create some
partitions. No longer are you creating ext2 partitions, now you'll
be creating partitions of the type Apple_UNIX_SVR2. Also, you'll be
using <span   class="bold"><b>pdisk</b></span> rather than
<span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> to create your partitions.
Use the <span   class="bold"><b>p</b></span> command to display the
partitions. If you've followed my advice above, you should see nine
partitions. These are created by default, and if you intend to
leave some form of running system (recommended), leave them
alone.</p><p>Now you need to create the partitions for your normal
partitioning scheme, I've chosen to create partitions for the mount
points /, /usr, /opt, /home and a swap partition. Yours may be
different, but the scheme I've created is shown in Table 1.</p><p><a href="4584t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Partition Map (with 512
byte Blocks) on /dev/hda</a></p><p>After you write the partitions to the table using the
<span   class="bold"><b>w</b></span> command, and you quit out of
pdisk (<span   class="bold"><b>q</b></span> command), reboot the
system. pdisk will not recognize the new partitions until a reboot.
Begin the installation anew by holding down the C key; indicate
your newly created mount points, and you can begin selecting
packages as you would on a normal Red Hat Linux installation. After
you have completed these steps, you're going to have to reboot
again. This time, don't hold down any keys as you want to boot the
Mac OS.</p><p>Now, back to the Mac OS. Open the yaboot.conf you copied to
the system folder and take a look. Mine looks like Listing
2.</p><p><a href="4584l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.
yaboot.conf</a></p><p>Notice the label for &ldquo;linux&rdquo;. The yaboot.conf that comes
from the CD has an error; you need to prepend the extra &ldquo;\\&rdquo; to
yaboot again. This time, use the command sequence Command-Opt-O-F
to get to OF. When you again get the &ldquo;0 &gt;&rdquo; prompt, enter the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0 &gt; boot hd:,\\yaboot
</pre><p>After some flickering, you'll be presented with a LILO-like
prompt. Linux should begin to boot. Success! You should now see the
power of Open Firmware; the command above allows you to execute a
file from your hard drive, and you haven't even booted an operating
system yet!
</p><p>After you log on as user root, you should edit the file
/etc/modules.conf and add the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
alias sound dmasound
</pre><p>This will allow you to use /dev/dsp to play audio. However,
in its present form, dmasound supports write only&mdash;you can't use it
to record data from an external microphone.
</p><p>I configured X (XFree86 3.3.6) using the XConfigurator that
runs during the Linux installation. I chose values for 1024 x 768
with a 24-bit color depth. In yaboot.conf I added the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
append="video=aty128fb:vmode:17,cmode:24"
</pre><p>so that the kernel would correctly observe the ATI graphics
card installed. Then I edited /etc/X11/XF86Config and added
<b  >DefaultBitsPerPixel 24</b> in the &ldquo;Screen&rdquo; section
so that I didn't have to pass the bits per pixel to
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> when I ran it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd5580.0xecec08"></a>AltiVec Stuff</h2></div></div><p>Now that Linux is installed the fun with AltiVec begins. As I
already mentioned, the AltiVec unit is an additional processing
unit, like the floating-point unit or the integer-unit, that
processes data stored in 32 128-bit vector registers. The vector
execution unit processes this vector data using the single
instruction multiple data (SIMD) model. The processor, with one
instruction, can operate on four, eight or 16 data units at once.
Shortly I give an example to clarify this.</p><p>Motorola added 162 new assembler instructions to allow
programmers to use the new functionality of the AltiVec-enabled
processor. These instructions are detailed in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>AltiVec
Technology Programming Environments Manual</em></span>
(altivec_pem). The higher-level C instructions that use these new
assembler instructions can be found in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>AltiVec
Technology Programming Interface Manual</em></span> (altivec_pim).
Both of these documents are available for download, in PDF format,
from either Motorola's web site or from
<a href="http://www.altivec.org" target="_self">http://www.altivec.org/</a>.</p><p>My next step was to download and install the AltiVec RPMs
from
<a href="http://www.altivec.org" target="_self">http://www.altivec.org/</a>.
These RPMs provide a version of gcc (2.95.2) that has been modified
to use these new directives. Installation is achieved by the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -U binutils-2.9.5.0.22-6.vec.ppc.rpm
rpm -i gcc-altivec-2.95.2-1i.ppc.rpm
rpm -i gcc-altivec-c++-2.95.2-1i.ppc.rpm
</pre><p>After installation, I was able to use this new gcc as
follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc-vec program.c -o program
</pre>


gcc installs into /opt/bin so that it doesn't affect the default
gcc. The RPM creates a link in /usr/bin, named gcc-vec, that points
to the vectorized gcc in /opt.
</p><p>To use the new vectorized commands, you have to write
applications that use them and use a version of gcc that is aware
of them. You cannot use this version of gcc on your standard C
source code and expect to achieve a performance increase from the
AltiVec unit. The AltiVec-enabled gcc is aware of new keywords and
new functions. altivec_pim is the first step in learning the new
commands provided for in gcc-vec. The new vector data types are
seen in Table 2.</p><p><a href="4584t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. AltiVec-enabled gcc: New
Keywords and Functions</a></p><p>Notice the new keyword vector. This indicates that the
following declaration is a 16-byte (128-bit) vector. Additionally,
these types must be aligned on 16-byte boundaries for the vector
execution unit to process the values suitably. A programmer must
use caution when de-referencing data that is not aligned on a
16-byte boundary and typically will massage the data to be so
aligned.</p><p>According to altivec_pim, compilers aware of the
AltiVec-enabled processor should provide the following
macro:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define __VEC__
</pre><p>To build code that is capable of compiling on multiple
architectures but is still capable of using the AltiVec
instructions, you can do something like the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef __VEC__
       /* Put your vector code here */
       /* ... */
#else
       /* do it the old-fashioned way, here */
       /* ... */
#endif
</pre>


To illustrate how to begin using the AltiVec-enabled gcc, I'll
provide an example in Listing 3 [see FTP site at
<a href="../listings/086/" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue86</a>].
</p><p>First, notice the typedef union definitions. As previously
discussed, the AltiVec registers are 128-bits. These definitions
guarantee that the compiler will align the data declared by these
types on 128-bit boundaries. Secondly, they provide a convenient
method of accessing the individual elements of the vector data
types. A final benefit of using the union data type is that now you
are given a mechanism to look inside your register&mdash;by using
<span   class="bold"><b>printf( )</b></span>. The altivec_pim
provides for formatted input/output using
<span   class="bold"><b>scanf( )/printf( )</b></span>. In theory, you
should be able to print a vector float register using the following
in your C code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
vector float f32 = (vector float)(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4);
printf( "%,vf\n", f32 );
</pre><p>To achieve this your C library (glibc*) must be aware of the
vector format directives. The current implementation of the GNU C
library (2.2) does not and probably never will. For this reason, I
hope to modify a version of the GNU C library to serve this
purpose. If you have any advice or interest, please feel free to
contact me.
</p><p>Next, notice the two different mechanisms for defining the
vector types. The first declaration is for the vector constants
stored in cVals, sVals, iVals and fVals where the vector data type
is declared and defined in the same statement. This illustrates how
to store constants (values that do not change at runtime) in
vectors.</p><p>The next method declares a union type and assigns the vector
values at runtime in an element-by-element fashion. This method
would allow you to read in data from a buffer, copy it to a vector
variable and pass it to your vector-aware functions.</p><p>Finally, notice the form of the vec_add( ) function. In all
cases, I have used the same function, vec_add( ), and it provides
the correct result, regardless of whether the arguments were vector
shorts, vector ints or vector floats (the arguments must be of the
same type). In this case, the compiler interpreted the data types I
passed as arguments to vec_add( ) and generated the correct form of
the assembler instruction vadd* for me. For example, in the
following C code the compiler is able to generate the mapping
below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
vector float a,b,c;
/* Assign a,b */
/*    ...     */
c = vec_add( a, b);
</pre><p>This translates to the following assembler instruction:
<pre     class="programlisting">
vaddfp c,a,b
</pre>


This just keeps getting easier.
</p><p>To compile this program, use the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc-vec -fvec vecdemo1.c -o vecdemo1
</pre><p>The -fvec switch to the compiler tells it to interpret the
vector commands. If you don't use the -fvec switch, the compiler
will not recognize the vector data types or commands and will print
error messages that will remind you to use the switch the next
time.
</p><p>The program produces the output shown in Listing 4.</p><p><a href="4584l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Output of the Vecdemo1
Command</a></p><p>I've tried to provide an introduction to Linux on the
PowerMac and to the AltiVec resources available to Linux
programmers. I would like to do more. Other possible avenues would
be to demonstrate how the AltiVec can be used as a platform for
signal processing, how these processors can be used in place of
special-purpose DSPs or to look at a common use for DSPs in signal
processing, finite impulse response (FIR) filters.</p><p>I would like to thank the members of the AltiVec forum. The
mail list has been an invaluable resource to get up and running.
Also, thank you to all of the AltiVec developers that have provided
such a rich set of tools to begin development on a platform as
powerful as the G4.</p><p><a href="4584s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
