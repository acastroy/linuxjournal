    Using beans makes working with JSPs easier for all levels of
    programmers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef7580.0x1fef6b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the previous two installments of &ldquo;At
the Forge&rdquo;, we began to work with Jakarta-Tomcat, an open-source
servlet and Java Server Pages (JSP) engine sponsored by the Apache
Software Foundation. As we have seen, it is neither difficult nor
time-consuming to create servlets or JSPs. Getting used to the
server-side Java paradigm is probably the biggest hurdle to using
them.
</p><p>While servlets offer us the full breadth of power and
expressiveness available from within a Java program, they force us
to think at a relatively low level. Every time we want to send
HTML-formatted text to the user's browser&mdash;quite often,
normally&mdash;we must use the PrintWriter object associated with the
HTTP response object:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
out.println("&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;Body&gt;This is illegal HTML&lt;/Body&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;");
</pre><p>JSPs come to the rescue, assuming that everything that is not
explicitly marked as an executable code section should be sent
verbatim to the user's browser. But this creates a new problem,
namely the fact that a JSP wanting to connect to a relational
database must add dozens or hundreds of lines of Java code.
</p><p>The solution is to create bundles of code that reside outside
of the JSP, whose methods can be invoked using a syntax that
resembles HTML more than it does Java. These bundles of code are
known as JavaBeans, and they can make it much easier to work with
JSPs, both for experienced programmers who want to work at a higher
level, and for inexperienced programmers who want to take advantage
of functionality.</p><p>This month, we will take a quick tour of JavaBeans. We will
write some of our own beans, integrate them into JSPs and discuss
some of the problems and pitfalls associated with them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef7580.0x1fef978"></a>What Is a Bean?</h2></div></div><p>From the perspective of someone implementing a bean,
JavaBeans are nothing more than Java classes that adhere to several
conventions. (We will soon discuss just what those conventions
are.)</p><p>But to someone who writes a JSP, a bean is a special type of
container into which we can store and retrieve certain types of
information. Each piece of information is known as a property and
can be set or retrieved individually. Not all properties can be set
and not all of them can be retrieved, but the interface to the bean
from a JSP is uniform and easy to understand.</p><p>Because beans understand a restricted set of actions, there
are special JSP tags that allow us to work with them. Using these
tags allows us to reduce the amount of Java code directly placed
within our JSPs. Not only does this reduce clutter and make our
JSPs more maintainable and readable, but it means that
nonprogrammers can take advantage of a bean's power without having
to learn to program in Java.</p><p>It's not unusual for a JSP to use multiple beans
simultaneously, storing and retrieving different properties as
necessary. Thus, a JSP for an on-line store's shopping cart might
use one bean for the store's inventory, another for the user's
shopping cart, and still another to track the user's language,
payment and shipping preferences. Each of these beans is
implemented by a separate Java class but is manipulated using
special JSP tags that hide most of the complexity from the JSP
author.</p><p>Of course, a bean can be used on multiple web sites (or by
multiple portions of a single site). If you develop a useful
JavaBean that encapsulates interesting functionality, other users
can drop that bean into their Java classpath, taking advantage of
the functionality from within their JSPs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef7580.0x1fefbe0"></a>Implementing a Bean</h2></div></div><p>To write a bean, we must write a Java class that implements
the java.io.Serializable interface. Simply put, this means that a
bean must be able to save to disk and restore itself. If the fields
of your class are common Java types, such as integers and strings,
then implementing Serializable shouldn't concern you too
much.</p><p>Listing 1 contains a simple bean implementation. This bean
contains a single instance variable (userID) and two methods. The
getUserID method returns the current value of userID, while the
setUserID method sets the value of that field. Because these
methods' return values and parameter lists match the signatures for
bean property methods, we can use them from within our JSPs.</p><p><a href="4686l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.
SimpleBean.java</a></p><p>On my system, which is running version 3.2 of the Apache
project's Jakarta-Tomcat servlets/JSP system, I placed my Java
classes under the directory $TOMCAT_HOME/classes ($TOMCAT_HOME is
an environment variable that points to the root of the Tomcat
installation; on my system, its value is
/usr/java/jakarta-tomcat-3.2.1/). If this &ldquo;classes&rdquo; directory
exists, it is added to the Tomcat CLASSPATH environment variable,
making it a convenient place to put new classes.</p><p>The class itself is very simple, demonstrating the different
types of methods you can create: 1) A bean constructor that takes
no arguments and can set one or more fields. In our particular
example, the SimpleBean constructor initializes userID to be 0. 2)
A get property method that returns a value to the caller. Like the
bean constructor, a get property method does not take any
arguments. 3) A set property method that takes a single argument
(the new value) but does not return any value to its caller.</p><p>Keep in mind that beans are classes like most other Java
classes, meaning that they must be recompiled before they are
reused. Moreover, the Tomcat servlet container does not
automatically reload classes that have been compiled. Your best bet
is to restart Tomcat each time you recompile a bean class.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef7580.0x1fefef8"></a>Using the Bean</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have created our simple bean class, how do we use
it from within a JSP? JSPs recognize three special tags, all of
which begin with &ldquo;jsp:&rdquo;.</p><p>Before we continue, a word of warning: the special tags that
allow us to work with JavaBeans from within a JSP are written in
XML rather than HTML. While HTML is a loosely defined specification
that does not always require us to close a tag, XML is much
stricter. Every opening &lt;tag&gt; must be closed by a matching
&lt;/tag&gt;. Without a closing &lt;/tag&gt;, the XML parser will
exit with an error. A tag can close itself by placing a slash at
the end of the tag, as in &lt;tag/&gt;.</p><p>This means that within an HTML-generating JSP using
JavaBeans, you will have to keep track of two slightly different
syntaxes. After a while, you will find that moving between these
two syntaxes is almost second nature. Moreover, the JSP parser
produces error messages that make it relatively easy to determine
when you have forgotten to place a trailing slash on a JavaBean
tag. However, this mix of syntaxes can be maddening at the
beginning, and you can expect to go through some hardship in
learning to understand it.</p><p>To use a JavaBean class, we use the special
&lt;jsp:useBean/&gt; tag. This tag tells the JSP to find and load a
particular bean and to create an instance of the bean within our
JSP. The &lt;jsp:useBean/&gt; tag also lets us give our bean
instance a name that we will use later on. Here is an example of
how to load our SimpleBean class from within a JSP:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;jsp:useBean id="simple"
 class="il.co.lerner.SimpleBean"/&gt;
</pre><p>As you can see, the tag ends with a slash (/), following the
XML syntax. There are actually cases in which you might prefer to
separate the &lt;jsp:useBean/&gt; tag into an opening
&lt;jsp:useBean&gt; and closing &lt;/jsp:useBean&gt;; whatever is
between those two tags is only performed when the bean is first
loaded into memory. However, the simpler form is not uncommon.
</p><p>The &lt;jsp:useBean/&gt; tag takes two mandatory parameters.
The class parameter names the package and class in which our bean
sits. The id parameter gives our bean a unique name within the JSP.
As with variable names, it is a good idea to choose clear
identifiers for working with beans. The more obvious the name, the
easier it will be to debug our JSP later on.</p><p>We can set and retrieve property values within our bean
instance with the &lt;jsp:setProperty/&gt; and
&lt;jsp:getProperty/&gt; tags. Both of these tags take a name
parameter whose value should be identical to the id that we gave
our bean earlier on (I am sure there is a good reason why we use an
id attribute in &lt;jsp:useBean/&gt; and a name attribute in
&lt;jsp:setProperty/&gt;, but I find it to be confusing). We can
thus retrieve the value of the userID property with the following
tag:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;jsp:getProperty name="simple" property="userID"/&gt;
</pre><p>This retrieves the userID property from the simple bean and
places it inside of the JSP. Note that this does not simply
retrieve the value, it also makes it visible to the user. Also
notice that the capitalization of our property name has been
altered slightly. In order to access the getUserID method within
our bean, we use &lt;jsp:getProperty/&gt; for the property userID.
Don't be fooled into thinking the property names are
case-insensitive, however; this transformation takes place simply
to keep things readable.
</p><p>To modify the value of a property, we use the
&lt;jsp:setProperty/&gt; tag. This tag does not return any results,
but it does take a value attribute whose value is then handed to
the appropriate method in the bean class:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;jsp:setProperty name="simple" property="userID"
 value="300"/&gt;
</pre><p>Listing 2 contains a complete JSP that demonstrates how we
can use our SimpleBean class from within a JSP. It displays the
default value of the userID property, then sets that property to a
new value and displays the new value.
</p><p><a href="4686l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.
use-simple.jsp</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef7580.0x1ff04d0"></a>Parameters and Properties</h2></div></div><p>It is certainly common for properties to be stored in a
bean's instance variables, as in our SimpleBean class. In such
cases, invoking &lt;jsp:setProperty/&gt; effectively sets the value
of the field, and invoking &lt;jsp:getProperty/&gt; retrieves its
current value. Of course, there is no reason why properties must
reflect fields. Properties can easily be stored to and retrieved
from a relational database. When you retrieve a property, it is
possible the returned value is being calculated in real time rather
than being returned from an instance variable.</p><p>Consider, for example, how we might create a bean that
performs simple mathematical operations. We can set two read/write
properties (call them arg1 and arg2) and then a number of read-only
properties we can use to perform calculations on these arguments.
Listing 3 (available at
<a href="../listings/086/" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue86</a>)
contains a simple bean, Calculate.java, which demonstrates how we
can accomplish this.</p><p>Because there is no setSum property, the JSP engine will not
allow us to invoke &lt;jsp:setProperty/&gt; on the sum property.
However, it will allow us to set arg1 and arg2 and to retrieve each
of the individual properties we might want.</p><p>Now that we have a working bean, we can use it from within a
JSP. Listing 4 contains the listing for calculator.jsp, which
performs some basic calculations using the JavaBean we just
created.</p><p><a href="4686l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.
calculator.jsp</a></p><p>The first and most interesting part of calculator.jsp is the
way in which it sets the properties:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;jsp:setProperty name="calculator" property="*"/&gt;
</pre><p>Normally, we can take one of the parameters passed via GET or
POST and assign its value to a particular property using the
following notation:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;jsp:setProperty name="calculator"
 parameter="foo" property="arg1"/&gt;
</pre>


In other words, the above tag will take the foo parameter and use
its value when invoking setArg1 on the calculator bean. But when we
use an asterisk, as in Listing 4, we indicate to the JSP engine
that we want to take each of the parameters we received and assign
each of the values to the properties of the same name. Thus, the
arg1 parameter will be passed to the arg1 property and so forth.
</p><p>On my system, where I have installed calculator.jsp under the
examples/jsp URL, I can assign arg1 the value 5 and arg2 the value
20 with the following URL:
http://localhost/examples/jsp/calculator.jsp?arg1=5&amp;arg2=20.</p><p>Of course, this is not a foolproof system. I can cause a
runtime exception by passing the following URL:
http://localhost/examples/jsp/calculator.jsp?arg1=5&amp;arg2=20.0.</p><p>The JSP engine tries to assign 20.0 (a float value) to arg2
(an int), which fails.</p><p>We can surround our &lt;jsp:setProperty/&gt; and
&lt;jsp:getProperty/&gt; tags with scriptlet tags, using the
standard Java try-and-catch mechanism to attempt to avoid runtime
errors. For example, the following code ensures we will never have
to deal with division-by-zero exceptions when using
getQuotient:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P&gt;Quotient:
    &lt;% try { %&gt;
        &lt;jsp:getProperty name="calculator"
        property="quotient"/&gt;
    &lt;% } catch (Exception e) { %&gt;
        &lt;B&gt;Error! division by zero&lt;/B&gt;
    &lt;% } %&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;
</pre><p>At the same time, this sort of code introduces more Java into
the JSP, precisely the reason why we began to use beans. Whether
the nonprogrammers on your staff will be able to handle this sort
of code depends very much on your environment, as well as the sorts
of beans you have created.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef7580.0x1ff0b58"></a>Bean Scopes</h2></div></div><p>As we have discussed in previous months, the servlet
container loads only a single copy of every servlet into memory at
a given time. It can get away with this because Java is
multithreaded, allowing a particular servlet to be executing
simultaneously for several HTTP requests. Since JSPs are actually
servlets in disguise, they are also subject to issues of
multithreading.</p><p>This raises the question of what happens to our JavaBeans:
how many times are they loaded; what is their scope? If a JSP sets
a property that happens to modify a class' fields, does this affect
all of the other instances of the same bean?</p><p>The answer is: It depends. There are four different types of
bean scopes, and the type of scope that you choose will profoundly
affect the way your bean is used. Application scope means a single
copy of the bean for all JSPs is running within the servlet
container. Session scope is for a single user, from the time they
enter the site to the time they exit. If a user opens two browser
windows onto your system, they will have identical sessions.
Request scope extends through the end of an HTTP request. This is
useful if you want to set a bean's properties in one JSP, use the
&lt;jsp:forward/&gt; tag to perform an internal redirect to a
second JSP and then continue to use that same bean from the second
JSP. Page scope is for a single JSP page. When the page exits, so
does the scope.</p><p>By default, beans are placed in the session scope. You can
change this by adding a scope parameter to the
&lt;jsp:useBean/&gt;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;jsp:useBean id="simple" scope="application"
 class="il.co.lerner.SimpleBean"/&gt;
</pre><p>Once we have done the above, properties set by one JSP will
be visible to other JSPs. Of course, because beans in the
application and server scopes might be executed by more than one
JSP simultaneously, they must be threadsafe. Consider the scopes in
which your beans are meant to be used, and make them threadsafe as
necessary. If a bean is not threadsafe, be sure to indicate as much
in its documentation so that others will not mistakenly use it in
the wrong way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef7580.0x1fe76a8"></a>Web Log</h2></div></div><p>Last month, we continued our simple investigations of web
logs with a JSP that directly accessed a relational database to get
the latest contents of a web log. While such a JSP is certainly
legal, it looks awkward, is difficult to debug and fails to
separate code from logic as elegantly as we might have
hoped.</p><p>By putting the database logic into a JavaBean, we can achieve
several of our goals: the code is reusable, available even to
nonprogrammers and allows us to change the source of information or
the application logic without rewriting our JSP. Listing 5
(available at
<a href="../listings/086/" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue86</a>)
contains the source code for our bean, which I have made threadsafe
(using the &ldquo;synchronized&rdquo; keyword within the getBlog method) so
we can create a single instance of application scope. This JavaBean
connects to the web log database and retrieves the latest
information. Listing 6 contains a small JSP that uses this JavaBean
to display the web log.</p><p><a href="4686l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6.
viewblog.jsp</a></p><p>There really isn't anything special about the bean in Listing
5, but it does bring together a number of things that we have been
discussing in the last few months. We now have a way for
nonprogrammers to access information in our web log without having
to write a single line of code on their own! Using a few simple JSP
tags, we can place our current blog contents in an HTML page
quickly and easily.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef7580.0x1fe7968"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>JavaBeans are a wonderful way in which to reduce the amount
of code we put in our JSPs, while making it easier to use. However,
complex JSPs will still contain some code, such as when they have
to iterate through loops or work with complex data.</p><p>Next month, we will see how we can write our own tags similar
to the jsp: tags we saw this month, using JSP's custom actions
facility. Therefore, we can create our own new tags, associating
them with any code we wish. In this way, JSPs allow us to create
our own new formatting language, as well as use the tags that have
been provided.</p><p><a href="4686s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
