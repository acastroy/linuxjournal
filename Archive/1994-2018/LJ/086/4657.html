    Maybe the rush to market for spreading internet access across the
    globe isn't in anyone's best interest&mdash;a report from
    the front.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e22580.0x1f1a660"></a></h2></div></div><p>Eleven years ago I installed a computer
system at a vocational training and development center in Tutume,
Botswana. Tutume is a rural village on the northeastern edge of the
Kgalagadi desert in southern Africa. The computer was intended to
help this organization, known as Tutume Brigades, catch up on its
bookkeeping for several business units crucial to the local
economy. Businesses included a brick-making unit, carpentry
workshop, auto repair garage, sorghum mill, school uniform
production unit, tractor hire and vegetable garden. For the local
village and the surrounding catchment era, the Brigades were
literally the only game in the bush for commodities, trade skills,
training and employment opportunities.
</p><p>When I arrived in Tutume, I was a pure novice in the field of
foreign assistance. I was also a mid-career financial professional,
with several years of experience in nonprofit and health-care
management in the United States. And like most aid workers new on
the ground in Africa, I knew what was best. In my assessment of the
center, I believed a computer was essential to get a handle on the
Brigades' financial position, which otherwise consisted of eight
separate sets of badly maintained manual ledgers, over nine months
in arrears. Except for the bank statements of eight separate
checking accounts (and even the bank statements proved unreliable),
we had no way of knowing if the center had any money. Every time we
had to make payroll or buy another truckload of cement, we were in
the heart of fiscal darkness.</p><p>Over the course of the next several months, I proceeded to
computerize the records and train local staff in basic operation of
the system. By the end of the first year, the financial records of
the center were timely and accurate. Moreover, other staff members
were beginning to use the computer for tasks such as word
processing and spreadsheets. Many of these employees had never even
used a typewriter before.</p><p>If I were to tell no more of this story and fade here to one
of the glorious Kgalagadi sunsets, this might be called a win.
Although set in the predawn (and pre-Linux) history of the Internet
era, today this would be described as a small success story of
&ldquo;bridging the digital divide&rdquo; in Africa&mdash;like I was a regular
Albert Schweitzer of the Information Age or something.</p><p>But the truth is not so simple, and the issues of foreign
assistance are not so trivial. The fact is, I am not proud of this
story. Because as my time in Tutume went on, I realized I had
blundered badly, to the point of putting the Brigades in serious
jeopardy. I began to ask myself such basic questions as: What would
happen to the computer after I left? Was the staff fully capable of
operating the system independently? Would backups be maintained and
performed rigorously? Were skills sufficient to troubleshoot
problems and reinstall the system if necessary? If the equipment
failed or was stolen, could the center afford to replace it? And
what would the center do when the staff I had trained for so long
were lured away by more lucrative jobs in the big city?</p><p>These questions all led to the same answer: the Brigades
would be left in even worse shape than I found them. Rather than
gaining empowerment, independence and enablement, they would more
than likely be left powerless, dependent and possibly ruined. And
all because of my own cultural myopia, despite my good
intentions.</p><p>It is axiomatic in the field of foreign assistance that the
aid program will take credit for the successes, while failures are
blamed on the host country. The psychology of failure can then be
even more severe and long-lasting than the loss of the project.
While I was working in Tutume, for example, a friend of mine was
working in the village of Lobatse in southern Botswana. Seven years
earlier, an aid organization from northern Europe had decided a
wool sweater factory would be just the ticket for the economic
development of the village. Of course, northern Europeans are fond
of nice wool sweaters and very likely have great need for them,
particularly in the colder climes of northern Europe. The market
for wool sweaters is less extensive in the sweltering and sparsely
populated Kgalagadi desert, however. After seven years of
subsidizing the losses of the operation, the aid organization
finally decided it was never going to be sustainable, and they
pulled the plug on the effort. My friend's unenviable assignment
was to put all the women out of work, sell the facility and
liquidate the equipment. It was hard for many of the women not to
feel that the fault was somehow their own.</p><p>Fortunately for Brigades in Tutume, such failure was averted.
As the story there continues, once I realized the risks, I spent
the next several months converting the accounting system back to
manual ledgers, hiring and training additional staff in bookkeeping
procedures and enabling them to use the computer primarily as a
support system, rather than as the central financial
database.</p><p>But what do these stories from Tutume and Lobatse have to do
with Linux and emerging markets? The rest of this article will
consider that question.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e22580.0x1f1aa28"></a>The Digital Divide</h2></div></div><p>Nine years have passed since I left Botswana. To put the
times into perspective, the first thing I bought when I got back to
the US was a fax modem, the cheapest, fastest solution to stay
connected with the contacts I had made abroad. My modem then was
2,400 baud. I tried out CompuServe and decided on Delphi, and the
buzz was just starting about something called PPP.</p><p>During the next several years I was in and out of Africa,
became a Linux user in 1995, began installing Linux in nonprofit
organizations in 1997, spent a year and Y2K transition in the
former soviet state of Ukraine and came to the West African country
of Guinea in May 2000. At some point during this period the digital
divide was invented.</p><p>Actually, the digital divide seems to have its origins in a
1995 report from the US Department of Commerce, whose National
Telecommunications and Information Administration (NITA) released
the first paper in a series titled &ldquo;Falling through the Net&rdquo;.
This report analyzed telecommunication access by geographic and
demographic patterns throughout the United States. One of the
conclusions of the report was the gap between the &ldquo;information
rich&rdquo; and the &ldquo;information poor&rdquo; had widened.</p><p>In the later years of the Clinton administration, the digital
divide broadened beyond US borders to encompass the globe. The
issue gained considerable publicity after a G8 economic summit
meeting in 1999, where the most powerful nations on earth decided
that the growing gap in information technology was one of the most
serious problems facing development in the Third World.</p><p>Now, as I write this, bridging the digital divide has become
one of the hottest trends in foreign assistance, and many aid
organizations and corporate philanthropists have found publicity
for their efforts. Simplistically, it seems, the gap in information
technology has now come to be identified with access to the
Internet. Thus, we have such programs as the USAID-funded Leland
Initiative, designed to bring internet access to Africa; the Peace
Corps announcing an information technology initiative in
partnership with AOL; and a recently formed organization called
Geekcorps sending its second group of volunteers on three-month
stints designing web sites in Accra, the capital of Ghana in West
Africa [see <i  >LJ</i> April 2001 for more on the
Geekcorps]. Naturally, the high-profile publicity given this issue
has created an opportunity for many international aid organizations
to develop projects and funding appeals for serving the digitally
needy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e22580.0x1f1ace8"></a>The New Tech Testament</h2></div></div><p>Delivering the miracle of the Internet is the new zeal of the
high-tech missionary. In what seems to be a rush to
market&mdash;bringing the Internet to the developing world&mdash;sometimes
projects are announced with only na&iuml;ve regard to the technical
issues and without full consideration of whether such projects are
viable, appropriate, relevant and sustainable. Thus, one hears of a
women's cooperative in Central America marketing their handcrafts
over the Web; advocates describe the potential of &ldquo;telemedicine&rdquo;
for delivering virtual health care to isolated areas; and the US
State Department Global Technology Corps proclaims, &ldquo;We have seen
farmers in Mexico using [the Internet] to check weather conditions
and crop prices.&rdquo;</p><p>Where once Norwegians may have seen wool sweaters, the tech
visionary now sees web browsers.</p><p>At the extreme, the new economy proselyte promotes the
Internet as the solution for everything from education and health
care to pollution, inequality and world peace. As though everyone
who has access will be able to browse their way to nirvana, as
though the path to heaven is paved with bandwidth. The satellite
dish is the new icon of the digital evangelist, replacing the holy
cross.</p><p>One of the implicit beliefs of this testament is that
information, in and of itself, is sufficient to promote economy,
remedy problems and narrow inequities. A corollary implication, the
message from one side of the divide to the other, is that we have
information and you don't, that our information is good and yours
is useless. This is the lesson CNN preaches to its international
audience when it tells us, &ldquo;The human without information is
nothing.&rdquo;</p><p>It should be clear that in this form, divide rhetoric is
simply new raiment for the familiar old taxonomies of prejudice
that have long sought to divide the world between believers and
heathens, the enlightened and the savage. From a historical
perspective, rather than helping, these kinds of belief systems
have generally been devastating to their targets.</p><p>More importantly, the belief in the sufficiency of
information and information technology is simply wrong. Information
alone doesn't help people. If only this were true, doctors would be
made from medical textbooks and entrepreneurs would be born from
accounting manuals.</p><p>In fact, the developing world is littered with unused X-ray
equipment, broken-down tractors and empty schoolrooms contributed
over the years by well-intentioned and simpleminded donors. These
resources are made useless not from missing user manuals or lack of
web access, but by the lack of trained technicians, mechanics and
teachers.</p><p>In short, what empowers people are skills.</p><p>Even in the US, this kind of awareness is emerging. In &ldquo;How
Does the Empty Glass Fill? A Modern Philosophy of the Digital
Divide&rdquo; (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Educause Review</em></span>, Nov/Dec 2000),
Solveig Singleton and Lucas Mast write: &ldquo;From the standpoint of
higher education, students who leave high school without exposure
to digital learning tools such as the Internet will prove a much
less serious problem than students who leave high school with
inadequate reading or math skills.&rdquo;</p><p>And the leading journal of free-market capitalism, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Economist</em></span>, recently observed:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The poor are not shunning the Internet because
they cannot afford it: the problem is that they lack the skills to
exploit it effectively. So it is difficult to see how connecting
the poor to the Internet will improve their finances. It would make
more sense to aim for universal literacy than universal Internet
access.</p></blockquote></div><p>It may be that, with the recent outbreak of dot-com
bankruptcy and declines in the stock market, the tenets of the
digital religion could be losing their currency. At a time when the
mega-billion, IPO-funded ebiz stars like Amazon and Yahoo are
having a tough go across the US and Europe, it's hard not to wonder
how the promises of e-commerce could possibly prove viable and
sustainable elsewhere, particularly in places where there aren't
even good banking and credit systems. And for someone like me who
has lived several years of the past decade in both rural and urban
parts of the developing world&mdash;where most of the population still
cook with firewood and carry water in buckets&mdash;the practical value
of focusing foreign assistance on IT projects would seem
negligible, if not ludicrous entirely. Given the more serious
fundamental issues facing developing nations&mdash;health care (AIDS, TB
and malaria), nutrition, sanitation, education, poverty, pollution
and political corruption&mdash;providing the means to surf the Web
should probably fall fairly low on any reasonable scale of human
priorities.
</p><p>So is there any way to make a difference, a real difference
that improves people's lives? Is there any role for Linux and
open-source advocacy in emerging markets? Are there ways of using
technology for solving human problems in places like Africa,
without trying to sell wool sweaters in the desert? I wouldn't be
writing this article if there weren't.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e22580.0x1f1b318"></a>Algorithms in Africa</h2></div></div><p>When it comes to Africa, the so-called digital divide is just
a divide; there isn't anything especially digital about it. The
divide is geographic, because Africa is a long way away, and
cultural, because the traditions and histories of Africans
developed independently from those of Europeans and Americans.
Almost incidentally the divide is economic, from the standpoint of
cash resources and differing perceptions of wealth, though the
natural resources of this continent are vast. The divide ends up
being mostly one of ignorance, and this gap is at its widest in
America.</p><p>Americans in general know very little about Africa, and what
little they do know or think they know is usually prejudiced and
fallacious. If I were to know the state of Florida only from news
reports, I would think it was a large mobile-home park of fat pink
people constantly flattened by hurricanes. Similarly, most
Americans probably only know Africa as a disaster zone of epidemic,
starvation and genocide. The principal media image Americans hold
of African assistance is usually the one of the brave young (white)
woman, a nurse or volunteer, holding a helpless black infant,
center stage among a group of grateful and admiring Africans in the
background.</p><p>Of course Africa is nothing like this image at all, and the
first step in crossing the divide here is to banish these offensive
stereotypes and learn all one can about what Africa is really like.
It would be a disservice to the many peoples of the continent to
generalize and describe the essence of Africa as though it were a
single place. But I would just like to say: Africa is such a joy!
Whenever I am in the streets of Conakry or an upcountry village, I
am overwhelmed with the pure bandwidth of humanity, of color and
vitality and life. So much more than can ever be expressed on even
your largest CRT, with even the fastest DSL connection; Africa is
the ultimate realization of broadband in culture and diversity,
natural and human content. Maybe a virtual, flat-screened reality
over the Internet is meaningful in the pitifully dreary cubicle of
the US office worker, but Africa is all about face time in real
time.</p><p>Open-source advocates can be sure that Africans get
community; Africans get bazaar. These are concepts intrinsic to the
cultures and traditions throughout the continent, where African
societies had mastered networking long before the invention of the
RJ45 jack. Africans have historically been quite receptive, often
at their ultimate peril, to ideas and innovations flowing between
cultures and brought in by outsiders. And in general Africa has
been early and enthusiastic about adopting new communication
technologies, particularly when they are practical and affordable.
So in Botswana I was astonished at the number of fax machines per
capita ten years ago, and now find a thriving trade in cell phones,
both legitimate and black market, in Guinea. On a recent visit to a
mosque in the interior of the country, a wizened old muezzin took
me up into the minaret specifically to show me their solar-powered
amplifier and loudspeaker system, used to call the village to
prayers.</p><p>As one learns to develop an appreciation of what Africa is
really like, it will then help if one can develop a sensitivity to
the pitfalls of foreign aid and the havoc such programs have
brought to this continent. The subject of other narrations, it is
sufficient to observe here that the official assistance programs of
foreign governments are usually a foul brew of political hegemony,
economic imperialism, cultural ethnocentrism, personal avarice and,
too rarely, genuine altruism. Too often the implementation of
foreign aid is all about developing market share and spheres of
influence, instead of improving lives. Proponents of foreign
assistance may even argue that these are synonymous, as though
markets for American soft drinks, snack foods and beauty products
result in happiness and prosperity for the consumer. The sad fact
is, whether intentional or merely consequential, foreign assistance
has often had devastating effects on communities, local markets,
traditional cultures and environmental conditions throughout
Africa.</p><p>Finally, it is helpful to bring an honest perspective of
one's own history and culture into focus. For example, the United
States represents less than 6% of the world's total population and
has existed for less than a blink of an eye in the span of all
human history. So, what makes us think we've got it right? What
evidence is there to suggest this brief record is proof that our
way of life and cultural adaptations will be viable in the long
run?</p><p>For example, it may be surprising to learn that, due to the
predations of infectious illness, urban population levels were not
even sustainable until about 100 years ago and required steady
migration from rural areas. And it was less than 90 years ago, Gina
Kolata writes in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Flu</em></span>, when &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ladies
Home Journal</em></span> proudly declared that the parlor, where the
dead had been laid out for viewing, was now to be called the living
room, a room for the living, not the dead.&rdquo;</p><p>Shortly after this proclamation, a global flu of epidemic
proportion&mdash;the origin of which is still not understood&mdash;killed 1.5
million Americans and 40 million worldwide. This was not in the
murky history of the Dark Ages; this was 1918. Today, with the
modern plague of HIV/AIDS, the re-emergence of tuberculosis and new
mysteries like the relationship of human CJD to Mad Cow Disease,
will our mastery of medicine prove all that enduring, even for the
world's most fortunate few?</p><p>In any case, those who would help others should at least try
to learn from past failures and have the humility to ask if the
modern model of urbanization, congestion, resource utilization and
environmental depletion are sustainable, even desirable, let alone
worthy of export to others in the world.</p><p>Then we may be able to accept that the Internet may not be
the solution to all problems of humankind and have the patience to
realize that working through the major challenges in Africa will
take time and understanding measured in generations. Now it becomes
clear that Linux and open-source developers are helping Africa best
by what they have been doing already. People who are programming
and installing the world-class, free software at the soul of
internet technology are helping others around the world in profound
and important ways, no matter what license they are using. GNU and
open-source software are the perfect fit for the emerging nations
of Africa&mdash;as for the rest of the world&mdash;not only for the superior
technical quality of these systems, but for the values embodied in
their development.</p><p>The mere existence of Linux and open-source systems give
people the chance to use these powerful technologies for low-cost,
grassroots level applications, an opportunity not possible just ten
years ago. The pages of this magazine have described many of these
self-directed success stories, everywhere from Mexico to Pakistan,
where Linux solutions enabled people to make the difference. Such
examples are to be found among African communities as well, from
South Africa to Kenya to Nigeria. And Africans like Katim Touray
are using Linux servers to connect other Africans in dialogue
around the world.</p><p>Beyond the software itself, though, it is the culture of
Linux and Open Source communities that provides the model for
meaningful outcomes. This is the culture of sharing and
empowerment, of the thousands of Linux users' groups throughout the
world, of the Linux Documentation Project and the general
willingness of one user to selflessly help another. Participating
as a Linux user is all about developing crucial skills and passing
them on. Often users' groups hold regular installation clinics,
giving new users personal, one-on-one support from an enthusiastic
peer. And these users' groups are often active in other community
projects, such as helping schools install servers and network
connectivity, while transferring the skills necessary to maintain
them. Each of these connections is essentially more human than
technical, linking people together more than their machines, and
can lead anywhere. Each of these personal connections sows the
seeds of others, and the spread of the Linux bloom is now reaching
to every corner of the earth. For example, even though the use of
internet technology in Guinea is nascent, Linux certainly preceded
my own arrival here. One finds Linux books in French in bookstores
and Guineans eager to learn more about this &ldquo;true&rdquo; operating
system.</p><p>And there are other instances of Linux and open source
helping to solve problems in Africa. One of the most inspiring and
hopeful to me involves no computers at all.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e22580.0x1f1b8f0"></a>Vim in Uganda</h2></div></div><p>The emergence and spread of AIDS has been devastating to
sub-Saharan Africa. Sure, you are probably tired of hearing about
it. For one thing, it is so hard to come to grips with the scale of
the problem. In the short time since I left Botswana&mdash;when AIDS was
just beginning to emerge as an issue there&mdash;life expectancy has
plummeted, from nearly 60 years to barely 40. It is now estimated
that as many as 40% of the adults in Zimbabwe are HIV positive.
This has been a debilitating setback to the emerging countries of
the region, where public health efforts had previously been making
remarkable gains.</p><p>The epicenter of AIDS in Africa has been Uganda, which was
hit first and perhaps hardest. The government of Uganda is
considered to have mounted an effective and ongoing public health
campaign for its people, and there is hope that the incidence of
HIV/AIDS is decreasing. Nevertheless, the consequences of the
disease have been severe. One of the biggest problems is the large
numbers of children left without parents. In a society where
children are traditionally treasured and raised with the supportive
assistance of extended families, there are simply too few adults
left to care for growing numbers of orphans.</p><p>Bram Moolenaar is the author of Vim, one of the most popular
open-source text editors, with ports available for just about any
platform in existence. Bram had already started Vim when he first
went to Uganda in 1994, volunteering to work as a water and
sanitation engineer for the Kibaale Children's Centre (KCC).</p><p>The center, located in a rural village of southern Uganda,
provides food, medical care and education to about 600 children,
most of whom have been orphaned by AIDS. The conditions are
austere: one book for ten children, a tiny blackboard and a roof
with holes.</p><p>Bram found that his skills could help at Kibaale, his help
made a difference. After a year spent working with the Centre, he
wanted to find ways he could continue helping the project while
also letting other people know of its existence.</p><p>That's when Bram hit on the idea of &ldquo;charityware&rdquo; for Vim.
The license for Vim says simply: &ldquo;Vim is Charityware. You can use
and copy it as much as you like, but you are encouraged to make a
donation to orphans in Uganda. Please read the file doc/uganda.txt
for details.&rdquo;</p><p>While using Vim, type <b  >:help uganda</b> to get
the complete text of the license and a description of the Kibaale
Children's Centre.</p><p>Beyond this, though, Bram is fairly modest about the project.
Although he asks for copies of CD distributions that include Vim,
he doesn't appeal to distribution vendors directly for any
additional financial support. Bram prefers to remain low key rather
than risk annoying people and turning them away from supporting the
Uganda project.</p><p>Knowing that Linux distributions in use are now in the
billions, one may wonder how successful the charityware license has
been as a fund-raising method for the Centre. Vim users are asked
to make contributions to the International Child Care Fund that
Bram and his colleagues have set up specifically to support the KCC
project, and the ICCF web site provides annual financial reports.
For 1999, donation income totaled about $7,000 US (17,800 Dutch
Guilders), up from about $3,500 US in 1998.</p><p>These figures may seem rather underwhelming and suggest that
the conscience of open-source users and vendors is not as evolved
as one may like to think. But the bottom line for Bram is, even at
such a modest level, these contributions make a huge difference in
what the KCC can accomplish. The funds raised by Vim donors are
used to keep the Centre running, maintain and improve the
facilities and recently purchased rainwater tanks so that more
people have access to clean water.</p><p>Bram continues his personal involvement with Kibaale to this
day, having made return trips in 1996, 1998 and 2000. This
experience gives Bram a thorough grounding in the realities of life
in Africa, as well as an understanding of the means of effecting
meaningful change. When I asked for his opinions about the digital
divide, he said, &ldquo;I'm afraid I don't know what the digital divide
is. Is it about bringing computer-related stuff to Third World
countries? Well, the area around Kibaale first needs a good water
supply and a phone.&rdquo;</p><p>When asked if he could give any suggestions to those
interested in projects supportive of African information
technology, Bram replied, &ldquo;The best suggestion I can make is to
work in small groups. A hundred small projects bring more benefit
than one project that's a hundred times bigger. The strategy and
planning done by people in head offices is a waste of time and
money.&rdquo; The message here is that the strength of any bridge
depends upon its integrity.</p><p>In the end, Bram is doing what the Open Source movement has
been all about from the beginning: working with personal
conviction, making a difference where one can and sharing the work
one loves with others. These are the ideals of a world seeking
connections, the values that can link Linux and the Internet with
an orphanage in Uganda. The human connections of these efforts
empower people, improve lives and build the solid bridges of
understanding among diverse global communities, digital and
otherwise.</p><p><a href="4657s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
