I'm not &ldquo;with it&rdquo; anymore. Lately, I've had exchanges with some
of these new kids on the block who claim to be CS majors who took
exception to me saying HTMLized mail is rude and presumptuous. Wish
I knew what they taught CS majors these days, but Netiquette
certainly isn't among the topics. At least not the Netiquette I've
come to know. Perhaps the new breed are being pumped out on the
Microsoft Internet. I don't know. I do know when these supposedly
computer-literate folks send me HTML mail, I get annoyed. I'm not
worried they'll give my system a virus (I don't read mail as root),
but not everyone has broadband access, even within the US. Outside
the US, many folks pay for every byte received. So it's pretty
presumptuous of them to send a 200K spaghetti-code HTMLized e-mail
in blinding colors, with print that goes from microscopic to
billboard size, to say they're CS majors and could I please explain
this or that to them. If they'd be equally as presumptuous and pay
my $750/month internet bill, they could hog as much of my bandwidth
as they wanted with their imitation spam mail. Until then, guess
I'll just have to start sending their HTML mail where it
belongs&mdash;/dev/null, along with the rest of the spam. Just wish I
could do that before it wasted my bandwidth. I also hope those San
Diego spammers got every day of the nine-year maximum sentence.
</p><p>IP Flow Meter:
<a href="http://www.via.ecp.fr/~tibob/ipfm" target="_self">http://www.via.ecp.fr/~tibob/ipfm/</a></p><p>I recently found that my internet connection was being eaten
up, and I didn't know by whom. Running
<span   class="bold"><b>tcpdump</b></span> was out of the question
since I didn't have a large disk drive handy (or time to sift
through the dump). I just wanted to know where to start looking;
after that I could take a look at the protocols. Well, I found IP
Flow Meter, and it does exactly what I needed. Within one hour
(after the first dump), I easily spotted the system with the most
input/output. Requires: libpcap, glibc.</p><p>Log Monitor:
<a href="http://logtk.sourceforge.net" target="_self">http://logtk.sourceforge.net/</a></p><p>This GTK utility allows you to monitor several different logs
at the same time (up to 25). Each log is contained on its own tab.
You can clear the log showing on the screen at any time. Entry
keywords can be highlighted in any of eight different colors
specified in a .rc file. Requires: libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule,
libglib, libdl, libXext, libX11, libm, glibc.</p><p>w3perl:
<a href="http://www.w3perl.com" target="_self">http://www.w3perl.com/</a></p><p>Need a log viewer for web statistics even the dullest witted
of PHBs can understand? Then this is the answer to your prayers.
These are graphics even a six-year-old can understand, and there
are lots of ways to display them. Setup is also fairly simple. One
of the best web statistics applications I've seen. Requires: Perl,
web browser, web server, cron (optional), Telnet or ssh
(optional).</p><p>SteelBlue:
<a href="http://www.steelblue.com" target="_self">http://www.steelblue.com/</a></p><p>If you have used Allaire's ColdFusion, you might want to take
a look at SteelBlue. This particular web application allows you to
program database queries to an SQL server, work with forms and do a
number of other things. Like ColdFusion, SteelBlue adds a few
extensions to the HTML language. One big difference, however, is
SteelBlue can be run from a command line&mdash;a web browser isn't
required. This is an absolute must for the serious web programmer.
Requires: web server, libpq, libstdc++, libm, libcrypt, glibc, SQL
server (PostgreSQL, MySQL, msql, others).</p><p>fwipe:
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~lbudney/linux/software/fwipe.html" target="_self">www.pobox.com/~lbudney/linux/software/fwipe.html</a></p><p>This utility securely wipes your files by first writing all
zeros to the file five times, then writing all ones to the file
five times. It then deletes the file. Obviously, you need to have
write permission to the file to do this. But anything that can be
retrieved from the filesystem will be all ones. Cheap insurance and
easy to use. Requires: glibc.</p><p>arb-scan.pl:
<a href="http://arbon.elxsi.de" target="_self">http://arbon.elxsi.de/</a></p><p>This utility is a remote banner scanner that will probe for
banners on the target and write the banners from any target host to
a file for later perusal. This could help ensure that banners
comply with company policies. It also checks mail servers to see if
they allow verify or expand operations (a really bad idea).
Requires: Perl, Perl module IO::Socket, Nmap, dig, finger.</p><p>weight:
<a href="http://world.std.com/~damned/software.html" target="_self">world.std.com/~damned/software.html</a></p><p>This is primarily a command-line shell script that can help
you keep track of your weight. You can add a weight daily (or less
often if you like). You can ask for your caloric debt, or you can
see a plot of your weight. Requires: shell.</p><p>wipl:
<a href="http://home.dkik.dk/users/worm/wipl-wrr" target="_self">http://home.dkik.dk/users/worm/wipl-wrr/</a></p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>wipl</b></span> utility will
capture and maintain statistics about packets it sees on the
network. These statistics can then be either displayed on a command
line or written as a web page for display in a browser. You can see
traffic listed with IP, MAC address and packets sent and received.
Good for monitoring bandwidth usage if you don't run
<span   class="bold"><b>snmp</b></span>. Requires: libstdc++, libm,
glibc, libpcap.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
