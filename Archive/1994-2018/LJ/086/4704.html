Penguin&rdquo; article on DMZ networks (March 2001): RPC is remote
procedure call and not RP control protocol; r commands like
<span   class="bold"><b>rsh</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>rlogin</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span> don't use RPC. In my humble
opinion, examples should use runlevel three instead of two because
three is the default runlevel for most Linux servers. Changes in
level two don't have an effect because Linux runlevels are
independents and not additionals as they are in other UNIX
flavors.</p><p>&mdash;Vitaly Karasikvkarasik@ndsisrael.com</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Bauer replies:</b></span> You're right
that RPC is remote procedure call and not RP control protocol and
that r commands like rsh, rlogin and rcp don't use RPC. But my
point was that both RPC and r commands are inappropriate for use on
publicly accessible systems, and I stand by that. As far as which
runlevel to use for examples, I could have been clearer on that. By
the way, Debian defaults to runlevel two.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23be580.0x24b63f8"></a>Korny Question</h2></div></div><p>I hate to bother you with a question for Stew, but since it
is a real newbie type of question you can probably answer it
without getting him involved.</p><p>In his article in the April 2001 issue &ldquo;Providing E-mail
Services for a Small Office&rdquo; he shares his cron job in Listing 5.
I usually like Korn shell and write my little scripts there, but
when I only use one &gt; on redirecting output, I only get the last
line sent to the file. Is Bourne better about understanding &gt;
vs. &gt;&gt; ? According to the way I read his tracking script, he
would not get the output in listing 6. I would have had to put
&gt;&gt; on all the lines except the first one if I wanted the
output in listing 6. Am I missing something?</p><p>&mdash;Richard Keatingrkeating@ins.com</p><p>So far as I'm aware, &gt; and &gt;&gt; mean the same thing in
Korn, Bourne and, for that matter, csh. &gt; replaces the file,
&gt;&gt; appends to it. Listing 5 would not produce the output seen
in listing 6. Looking at the author's original, it read:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

categories. I eagerly await every issue of <i  >LJ</i>
(we have a subscription at the school where I work as a teacher)
and read almost everything from the front cover on. In the April
2001 issue I read a presentation of Kylix, which I have been
waiting for, being a Pascal and Delphi programmer, but the price of
these two commercial products has made it impossible for my budget.
When I read your article &ldquo;Stop the Presses&rdquo; new hope came to me
as I thought an Open Edition existed for free download. That hope
turned to disappointment when I went to Borland's web page and
didn't find any mention of an Open Edition, only the two overpriced
commercial products. So where is this Open Edition of Kylix?</p><p>&mdash;Bertil Wergeliuswbertil@tjohoo.se</p><p>The free download version of Open Edition is expected to be
available sometime in Summer 2001.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23be580.0x24b69d0"></a>Thanks</h2></div></div><p>I wanted to let you know that I think you're doing a great
job with <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and the article &ldquo;The

read in a magazine.</p><p>&mdash;Jeremy Hayescotk_hayes@hotmail.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23be580.0x24b6b88"></a>O Captain, My Captain</h2></div></div><p>I enjoyed the review on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Descent 3</em></span> from
Loki (<i  >Linux Journal</i>, April 2001). I think I
will enjoy this game because I like the thought of controlling a
doomed ship and trying to find help from others, as well as
investigating sabotage done to the ship and sending out radio
transmissions. Everything about this game is quite intriguing. I do
believe you sold me!</p><p>&mdash;Jose CausingSilhouet98@cs.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23be580.0x24b6d98"></a>Linux Too US-Centric</h2></div></div><p>Paul Taylor (Letters, <i  >LJ</i> March 2001)
complains about SuSE 7.0 defaulting/reverting to a German keyboard.
I'm afraid he won't get any sympathy from those who don't live in
the US and have to put up with this type of behaviour from the
majority of products. The arrogance of US companies means that most
systems default to US dates, US keyboards, US spellings and US
measurements, often requiring considerable effort by users to
&ldquo;fix&rdquo; their machines for their own locale. Linux is particularly
poor in this area compared with, for example, Microsoft. At least
with a Windows OS, if the locale is set correctly on initial
install, it stays that way for all Microsoft applications and most
other third party applications (although Microsoft's idea of Metric
measurements has a strange US flavour&mdash;what is &ldquo;A4 Letter&rdquo;?). Not
so with Linux. I have often been caught out on Linux, particularly
with log files, because the dates are formatted wrongly. The Linux
crowd do care about the end user, as long as the end user is a
techie and an American. I would rewrite Paul's last sentence as: I
think the basic problem with most of the software development crowd
is that they don't give a rat's arse about the non-US end
user.</p><p>&mdash;Mark Easterbrook, Southampton, UK</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23be580.0x24b6f50"></a>Disturbing FX</h2></div></div><p>I read the article &ldquo;GFX: XFree and Video4Linux&rdquo; (April
2001) by Mr. Rowe, and I must say, for the first time in my life,
an article in <i  >LJ</i> really disturbed me.</p><p>Mr. Rowe presents himself as a person who hasn't followed
Linux from the beginning and doesn't know it, but having picked it
up he now dislikes it. He says that Xf86Config is &ldquo;prehistoric&rdquo;,
Xf86Setup is &ldquo;not good enough&rdquo; for him, pure text programs are
&ldquo;dated applications&rdquo;, <span   class="bold"><b>dselect</b></span> is
&ldquo;primitive&rdquo; and so on.</p><p>&ldquo;Why our mouse wouldn't work was a mystery&rdquo;, he says, and
he says also that some desktop managers &ldquo;also include a window
manager, but desktop managers have a lot of other features&rdquo;. It's
ridiculous: can one really come to <i  >LJ</i> and
print such things?</p><p>It is clear that (after the X server) the window manager is
the first component you need to decore your screen, but obviously
enough, Mr. Rowe never tried twm, fvwm, olvwm and all the tiny
windows managers that can run on the i386 with 2MB of RAM and 60MB
of hard disk. Saying that Xf86Config is prehistoric indicated that
one must never have tried to tune manually the timing lines on
XF86Config, too.</p><p>&mdash;Franco Favento dei Favento da
Triestef.favento@ieee.org</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Rowe replies:</b></span> Franco, sorry
my article disturbed you. Thank you for writing to let me know. I
like Linux, but I still see things that need improvement. Many
involved in the development of Linux and Linux-based software share
this opinion. Otherwise, why the ongoing effort? The criticism that
bothered you wasn't really about Linux, was it? It was XFree86, a
GUI also used by FreeBSD and other operating systems. If we compare
the available configuration tools to editing modelines by hand,
then you are right that we should appreciate a great improvement.
If, on the other hand, we compare to configuration in Windows, Mac
and BeOS, then saying XFree86 is primitive is one of the kinder
things that may be said. Many users experience distress configuring
XFree86. In response to your question, I have used twm and olvm,
but have not tried fvwm. Back when my desktop was a Sun Sparc20 I
developed multimedia software running on OpenLook (that is, olvm).
Open-source software can be responsive to a cry for improvement.
And, what better place to point out what we should be thinking
about improving in Linux software than <i  >Linux Journal</i>? My column is
not about moving to Windows (as you suggest), but about moving from
Windows to Linux. Thanks again for writing. I hope some of my
future articles may be more to your liking.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x23be580.0x24b73c8"></a>Simple Accents</h2></div></div><p>This is about the keyboard question to get &aacute; or
&ccedil; (Best of Technical Support, April 2001). I think the
answers there were too complicated.</p><p>Just edit your XF86Config and make sure your keyboard section
does not have any &ldquo;no dead keys&rdquo; statements. Finally, pick
&ldquo;en_US&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;us&rdquo; which is the default. Now all those
<span   class="emphasis"><em>trs int&eacute;ressantes</em></span> combinations will be
available using your dead key. It will work everywhere too, even on
