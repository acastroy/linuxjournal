    Embedded Linux shows its stuff!
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1863580.0x195b5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p> Embedded Linux was an active player at
this year's European technology mega-expo held in Hannover,
Germany. Lots of new devices with &ldquo;Linux inside&rdquo; were
demonstrated or announced at CeBIT.
</p><p>Sharp finally unveiled their plans for a Linux-based PDA at a
CeBIT news conference. It's called the MultiMedia Tool and has a
320 x 240 color LCD and can be used to surf the Web, check e-mail,
play MP3 and MPEG4 files, and also comes with a suite of PDA PIM
applications. Other features are a pullout keyboard, 32MB of
memory, and interfaces to USB and infrared. It also has a Secure
Digital slot, the same technology used by Palm. Special software
called PacketPlayer supposedly provides efficient streaming of live
video from wireless sources. Rumor has it that Sharp received
development support from AXE on the GUI and from Red Hat on the
embedded Linux OS.</p><p>Galleo announced a Linux-based PDA/cell-phone combo device
called the Mobile Multimedia Communicator. Like several other
recently introduced handheld computers with wireless connectivity,
this gizmo combines the functions of a PDA, web appliance and
cellular phone. It sports a 320 x 240 TFT LCD, which is used in
portrait mode and includes special page software that condenses
standard web pages to make them easy to view on the
quarter-VGA-sized screen.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4682f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

cellular functions.
</p></div></div><p>IBM showed off a second-generation Linux wristwatch at CeBIT.
This one is smaller than the original and features a bright yellow
OLED (organic light-emitting diode) 640 x 480 pixel display. The
watch face is now 0.65" x 0.87" in size, and the battery life has
been increased to between four and six hours, as a result of some
tweaking of the kernel by IBM. Let's see...that means the watch
only needs to have six hour marks, instead of the usual twelve,
right?</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4682f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

display.
</p></div></div><p>Korean electronics powerhouse LG Electronics has announced a
new Linux-based wireless webpad aimed at home users and offering
internet connectivity and a built-in multimedia player. LG's
Digital iPad is powered by a 206MHz Intel SA-1110 system-on-chip
processor with 64MB of SDRAM memory, and it connects to the
Internet via an 802.11 wireless transceiver. I/O and memory can be
expanded using PCMCIA cards.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4682f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Korea's LG Electronics will soon enter the webpad market with this
Linux-based device.
</p></div></div><p>Similarly, Taiwan manufacturing giant MiTAC also unveiled a
Linux-based, Bluetooth-connected handheld computer called the CAT.
It has a 4.1" 320 x 240 pixel backlit monochrome LCD and is amply
endowed with interconnection ports, including Bluetooth, IrDA,
RS-232 and USB. In addition to all the usual PIM applications and
internet support, software is included for playing MP3s and voice
record/playback.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4682f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

handheld Linux computer.
</p></div></div><p>You can now buy iPAQ PDAs preloaded with Linux in Germany.
Trolltech and Lisa Systems collaborated on an Linux iPAQ solution
demonstrated at CeBIT that includes the iPAQ, embedded Linux,
Trolltech's Qt/Embedded and Qt Palmtop Environment (and PIM suite),
custom software components from Lisa Systems for power management,
internet access, MPEG player, and a KDE-based browser and file
manager. The package also includes support for wireless web access
using either a Nokia cardphone or a GPRS cell phone.</p><p>Esfia demonstrated a Linux-based Chinese PDA solution for the
iPAQ at CeBIT that includes Esfia's RedBlue embedded Linux
operating system and RedBlue/Palmlike windows launcher, an FLTK GUI
application framework, the ViewML browser, PIM applications, power
management, internet access, MP3/MPEG player, picture viewer, fax,
e-mail, Chinese handwriting recognition, synchronization from IrDA
and USB, games and a file manager.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1863580.0x195c000"></a>It's in the Numbers</h2></div></div><p>Here are three interesting results from LinuxDevices.com's
