    Take security evaluation and vulnerability reduction to a higher
    level with Nessus.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x19515b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Last month we began exploring the
dangerous and fun world of scanning, focusing on the powerful port
scanner <span   class="bold"><b>Nmap</b></span>. Nmap helps system
administrators and security auditors (and yes, prospective crackers
too) determine for what services a given host is accepting
connections.
</p><p>Seeing what points of entry a host offers is a good start in
evaluating that host's security. But how do we interpret the
information Nmap gives us? For example, in one of the scans we
tried last month, the output looked like Listing 1.</p><p><a href="4685l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Nmap Scan Using TCP
Connect, UDP and RPC Modules</a></p><p>Just what does this mean? Sure, we know this host is running
a web server (on TCP 80), some level of RPC services (UDP 111, UDP
1026) and probably Windows shares, too (UDP 137, TCP 138-139). But
which of these services are actually exploitable?</p><p>This is where security scanners come in. At the risk of
getting ahead of ourselves, let's look at the output from a
<span   class="bold"><b>Nessus</b></span> scan of our test target
(see Figure 1).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4685f1.large.jpg"><img src="4685f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Nessus Scan of Windows 98 Host from
Listing 1</p></div></div>
</p><p>Space doesn't permit me to show the entire (expanded) report,
but even this abbreviated version shows that Nessus identified
seven apparent &ldquo;holes&rdquo;, or potentially exploitable
vulnerabilities in our target system. It also generated four
additional warnings and provided two supplemental security
notes.</p><p>Among other things (you can't see all of this in Figure 1, so
you'll have to take my word for it), Nessus determined that this
host was running the Sambar web server with no administrative
password and with the dangerous
<span   class="bold"><b>mailit.pl</b></span> cgi-script, had its
entire C:\ drive shared without any password set (and even if one
had been set, Nessus determined that this system was vulnerable to
both &ldquo;Null session&rdquo; connections and &ldquo;first-letter&rdquo; passwords),
was running an FTP server on TCP port 1432 (which Nmap had
incorrectly guessed was running the blueberry-lm service) and had a
TCP/IP stack that used predictable TCP sequence numbers. These can
be exploited a number of ways, including TCP-hijacking and
IP-spoofing attacks.</p><p>Yow! This host is ripe to be owned.</p><p>So, what is this deadly magic called Nessus? And why did it
dance little circles around Nmap when it came to analyzing this
system?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x1951ce8"></a>Security Scanners Explained</h2></div></div><p>Whereas a port scanner like Nmap (which is the gold standard
in port scanners) tells you what's listening, a security scanner
like Nessus tells you what's vulnerable. Since you need to know
what's listening before even trying to probe for actual weaknesses,
security scanners usually either contain or are linked to port
scanners.</p><p>As it happens, Nessus invokes Nmap as the initial step in
each scan. Thus, it was misleading of me to imply that Nessus
out-analyzed Nmap: Nessus depends on Nmap.</p><p>Once a security scanner has determined which services are
present, it performs various checks to determine which software
packages are running, which version each package seems to be at and
whether they're subject to any known vulnerabilities. Predictably,
this level of intelligence requires a good vulnerability database
that must be updated periodically as new vulnerabilities come to
light.</p><p>Ideally, the database should be user-editable, i.e., it
should be possible for you to create custom vulnerability tests
particular to your environment and needs. This also ensures that,
should the scanner's developer not immediately release an update
for a new vulnerability, you can create the update yourself. Not
all security scanners have this level of customizability, but
Nessus does.</p><p>After a security scanner locates, identifies and analyzes the
listening-services on each host it's been configured to scan, it
creates a report of its findings. The better scanners don't stop at
pointing out vulnerabilities; they explain them in detail and
suggest how to fix them.</p><p>So meaty are the reports generated by good security scanners
that highly paid consultants have been known to present them as the
primary deliverables of supposedly comprehensive security audits.
This is a questionable practice, but it emphasizes the fact that a
good scan produces a lot of data.</p><p>There are a number of free security scanners available: VLAD,
SAINT and Nessus are just a few. Nessus, however, stands out as a
viable alternative to powerful commercial products, such as ISS'
Internet Scanner and NAI's CyberCop Scanner. Developed primarily by
Renaud Deraison and Jordan Hrycaj, Nessus surely ranks with the
GIMP and Apache as tools that equal and in many ways exceed the
usability and flexibility of their proprietary counterparts.</p><p>Before we go any further, I should repeat last month's
caution: knowledge is power&mdash;use it responsibly! Tools such as
Nessus and Nmap should only be run against systems and networks
you're authorized to scan. And note that unauthorized port
scanning, while frowned upon, is generally not illegal, but
unauthorized security-scanning can get you into a great deal of
trouble. Consider yourself warned.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x1952058"></a>Nessus' Architecture</h2></div></div><p>Nessus has two major parts: a server, which runs all scans,
and a client, with which you control scans and view reports. This
distributed architecture makes Nessus flexible and also allows you
to avoid monopolizing your workstation's CPU cycles with scanning
activities. It also allows you to mix and match platforms; you can
use the UNIX variant of your choice as the server, with your choice
of X, Java or MS-Windows clients. (Note, however, the Java client
no longer appears to be in active development.)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>nessusd</b></span> listens for client
connections on TCP port 3001 and also TCP 1241 (1241 was recently
assigned to Nessus by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority; 3001
will be phased out eventually). Client sessions are authenticated
using an El Gamal-based public-key scheme and encrypted using a
stream cipher whose session key is negotiated dynamically for each
connection. In this regard, Nessus' cipher layer (implemented by
Jordan Hrycaj using his libpeks library) behaves similarly to
SSL.</p><p>Nessus' client component,
<span   class="bold"><b>nessus</b></span>, can be configured to log
in either transparently (i.e., with no password associated with
your private key) or with a password that protects your private
key, thereby preventing unauthorized users from connecting to the
Nessus server from your workstation.</p><p>Once you've connected with a Nessus server, you're presented
with a list of plugins (vulnerability tests) supported by the
server and a number of other options. If you've compiled it into
Nessus, you may also be given the option to run a detached scan
that can continue running even if you close your client-session. A
whole page of options pertaining to the creation and maintenance of
a knowledge base can also be compiled in, allowing you to store
scan data and use it to track your hosts' security from scan to
scan (e.g., to run differential scans).</p><p>Note that these are both experimental features; they must be
explicitly compiled into Nessus due to minor stability issues, but
these will have been fixed (and the features fully integrated) by
the time Nessus version 1.2 is released. I mention them here
because the Detached Scan feature in particular is a good example
of the value of Nessus' client-server architecture.</p><p>Once you've configured and begun a scan, Nessus invokes each
appropriate module and plugin as specified and/or applicable,
beginning with an Nmap scan. The results of one plugin test may
affect how or even whether subsequent tests are run; Nessus is
pretty intelligent that way. When the scan is finished, the results
are sent back to the client. If the session-saving feature is
enabled, the results may also be stored on the server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x19523c8"></a>Getting and Installing Nessus</h2></div></div><p>Nessus, like most open-source packages, is available in both
source-code and binary distributions. Red Hat 7.0 binaries of
Nessus version 1.0.7a (the latest version as of this writing),
however, are available only from
<a href="http://redhat.aldil.org/rpm.html?id=73" target="_self">redhat.aldil.org/rpm.html?id=73</a>,
courtesy of Matthias Saou (these binaries have not been compiled
with the experimental features).</p><p>If you don't use Red Hat 7.0, if your distribution doesn't
have its own Nessus packages (Debian 2.2 does) or if you want to
use experimental features, you'll need to compile Nessus from
source. Not to worry, if you first install a few prerequisites and
follow Nessus' installation instructions, this compile should go
smoothly. The Nessus FAQ
(<a href="http://www.nessus.org/doc/faq.html" target="_self">www.nessus.org/doc/faq.html</a>)
and Nessus Mailing List
(<a href="http://list.nessus.org" target="_self">list.nessus.org</a>)
provide ample hints to compile and install Nessus.</p><p>Nessus' prerequisites are: Nmap, the port scanner we
discussed last month; gtk, the GIMP toolkit, including the packages
gtk+, gtk+-devel, glib-devel and XFree86-devel; and the scripting
environment m4, or libgmp (whose package is simply called
gmp).</p><p>Once you've installed these, your distribution may have
further prerequisites; I'm aware of two such situations. First,
gmp-2.0 is needed for Red Hat 7.0 (which usually includes gmp-3.0
but not 2.0; you'll need to use RPM's --force option if you install
2.0 and 3.0 is already in place). This package is available from
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/swr/i686/gmp-2.0.2-5.i686.html" target="_self">www.redhat.com/swr/i686/gmp-2.0.2-5.i686.html</a>.</p><p>Second, to install or compile Nessus on SuSE Linux you must
first install the packages bison, flex, gtkdev and glibdev. See
<a href="http://www.nessus.org/doc/faq.html" target="_self">www.nessus.org/doc/faq.html</a>
for more details.</p><p>After all prerequisites are in place you're ready to compile
and/or install your Nessus packages. Compiling is easy: for each of
the four packages simply 1) un-gzip and un-tar it; 2)
<b  >cd</b> into its directory and run
<b  >./configure</b>; 3) <b  >make</b>; and 4)
<b  >make install</b>. The packages should be compiled
and installed in the following order: nessus-libraries, libnasl,
nessus-core and nessus-plugins.</p><p>Before you run the configure script for nessus-core, consider
whether you want to use the session-saving and/or knowledge-base
features. Session saving allows both crash recovery (e.g., the
resumption of a scan interrupted by an application or OS crash) and
detached scans (see above) and is enabled by including the flag
--enable-save-sessions when you run configure.</p><p>The knowledge-base feature allows you to store scan results
in a database on the server, which in turn allows you to run
differential scans. The configure flag to activate the knowledge
base is --enable-save-kb.</p><p>Thus, if I want to compile Nessus to enable both
session-saving and the knowledge base (and their corresponding
features), before I compile nessus-core, I'll invoke configure this
way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --enable-save-sessions --enable-save-kb
</pre><p>See http://www.nessus.org/documentation.html for detailed
instructions on compiling and using these features (because they're
experimental, that's the last thing I'll say about them in this
article).
</p><p>After all four packages are compiled and installed, make sure
that the file /etc/ld.so.conf contains the line /usr/local/lib (if
it doesn't, add it with the text editor of your choice). Then, run
<span   class="bold"><b>ldconfig</b></span> to update ld's (the
dynamic linker's) cache.</p><p>Finally, since one of the strengths of Nessus is the
regularity with which the developers add new vulnerability scripts,
it makes sense to start out with a complete vulnerability database.
If you run the script
<span   class="bold"><b>nessus-update-plugins</b></span>, all plugins
created since the current version of Nessus was released will be
automatically downloaded to your system using
<span   class="bold"><b>lynx</b></span>. I recommend the usage
<b  >nessus-update-plugins -v</b>, since without the -v
flag the script will not print the names of the plugins it's
installing. After downloading, uncompressing and saving new
scripts, nessus-update-plugins will reset nessusd so it sees the
new plugins (assuming a nessus d&aelig;mon is active at that
moment).</p><p>At present this script does not check these scripts against
MD5 or other hashes; this mechanism can therefore be subverted in
various ways. If that bothers you, you can always download the
plugins manually from
<a href="http://www.nessus.org/scripts.html" target="_self">www.nessus.org/scripts.html</a>,
one at a time, but even then you won't know if anything's fishy
unless you review each script (they go in
/usr/local/lib/nessus/plugins) before the next time you run a
scan.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x1d4b068"></a>Nessus Clients</h2></div></div><p>Unless you're only going to use the Nessus server as its own
client (i.e., run both nessusd and nessus on the same host), you'll
need to perform additional installations of Nessus on each host you
wish to use as a client. While the Nessus server (the host running
nessusd) must be a UNIX host, clients can run on either UNIX or
MS-Windows. Compiling and installing Nessus on UNIX client machines
is no different than on servers (as described above).</p><p>Installing any of the Windows clients (WinNessus, NessusW and
NessusWX) is a bit simpler, as all three are available in binary
form. Personally, I prefer WinNessus of the three, since it so
closely resembles the UNIX GUI (I'm lazy that way). All three
Windows clients are available at
<a href="http://www.nessus.org/win32.html" target="_self">www.nessus.org/win32.html</a>.</p><p>Before we talk about proper use of the Nessus client, we'd
better start our d&aelig;mon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x1d4b278"></a>Running and Maintaining nessusd</h2></div></div><p>Okay, we're back at our Nessus server's console and ready to
fire Nessus up for the first time. (Are you excited? For good
reasons and not evil, I hope!) nessusd is different from many other
d&aelig;mons in that it can be invoked either as a proper
d&aelig;mon (i.e, running in the background) or with flags and
parameters that reconfigure Nessus. Therefore, to actually start
the d&aelig;mon in d&aelig;mon mode, we enter <b  >nessusd
-D</b>.</p><p>As we'd expect with a client/server application, we also need
to create some Nessus user accounts on our server. These are
independent of the server's local UNIX user accounts. Nessus
accounts can be created two different ways. First, we can invoke
nessusd with the -P flag immediately followed by a username and
one-time password. This neither interferes with a running nessus
d&aelig;mon nor starts a new one; it does, however, immediately
update Nessus' user database and transparently restarts the
d&aelig;mon.</p><p>For example, to add user &ldquo;bobo&rdquo; with a password of
&ldquo;scuz00DL&rdquo;, we enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nessusd -P bobo,scuz00DL
</pre><p>The password is called a one-time password because by
default, after bobo first logs in and gives this password, his
public key will be registered with the Nessus server; subsequent
logins will not require him to enter this password again (they'll
be authenticated transparently using an SSL-like challenge/response
transaction).
</p><p>The second and more powerful way to create new user accounts
on the server is to use the
<span   class="bold"><b>nessus-adduser</b></span> command. This
script actually does most of its magic by invoking nessusd, but it
presents you with a convenient interface for managing users with
more granularity than a simple nessusd -P. You are prompted not
only for a username and one-time password, but also an IP address
from which the user may connect and rules that restrict which hosts
the user may scan with Nessus.</p><p>I leave it to you to read the nessus-adduser man page if
you're interested in this level of user account management. Our
remaining space here is better spent discussing how to build, run
and interpret Nessus scans.</p><p>Before we leave the topic of authentication, though, I should
mention the other kind of authentication Nessus uses: one local to
each client session. When you start Nessus (the client, not the
d&aelig;mon) for the first time, you are prompted for a passphrase.
This passphrase protects a private key stored in the home directory
of the UNIX account you're logged into when you start Nessus, and
you'll be prompted for it every time. Then, when you connect to a
Nessus server, your private key will be used in the transparent
challenge/response transaction I described earlier; it actually
authenticates you to the remote nessusd process.</p><p>If all this seems confusing, don't worry: just remember that
the password you're prompted for each time you start Nessus has
nothing to do with the password you use the first time you connect
to a Nessus server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x1d4b6f0"></a>Performing Security Scans with Nessus</h2></div></div><p>Now the real fun begins! After Nessus has been installed and
at least one user account set up, you're ready to scan. First,
start a client session and enter your client-private-key's
passphrase when prompted (by the way, you can change or delete this
passphrase with the command <span   class="bold"><b>nessus
-C</b></span>, which will prompt you for your current passphrase
and what you'd like to change it to).</p><p>Next, enter the name or IP address of the Nessusd host
(server) you wish to connect to, the port it's listening on, your
preferred encryption method and your Nessus login/username (Figure
2). The defaults for Port and Encryption are usually fine.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4685f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. User &ldquo;bobo's&rdquo; First Login to a Nessus
Server</p></div></div>
</p><p>When you're ready to connect, click the Log in button. If
this is the first time you've connected to the server using the
specified login, you'll be prompted for your one-time password
(next time, you won't be). And with that, you should be connected
and ready to build a scan.</p><p>If you click the Plugins tab, you're presented with a list of
all vulnerability tests available on the Nessus server, grouped by
family (Figure 3). Click on a family's name (these are listed in
the upper half of the window) to see a list of that family's
plugins. Clicking on a family's check-box allows you to enable or
disable all its plugins.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4685f3.large.jpg"><img src="4685f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Plugins Screen (Windows Family Selected
and Displayed)</p></div></div>
</p><p>If you don't know what a given plugin does, click its name
and an information window will pop up. If you hover the
mouse-pointer over a plugin's name, a summary caption will pop up
that briefly states what the plugin does. Plugins with yellow
triangles next to their check-boxes are dangerous: the particular
tests they perform have the potential to interrupt or even crash
services on the target (victim) host. Enable these with extreme
care.</p><p>Don't be too worried about selecting all, or a large number
of, plugins. Nessus is intelligent enough to skip, for example,
Windows tests on non-Windows hosts. In general, Nessus is efficient
in deciding what tests to run and in what circumstances.</p><p>The next screen to configure is Prefs (Figure 4). Contrary to
what you might think, this screen contains not general, but
plugin-specific, preferences, some of which are mandatory for the
corresponding plugin to work properly. Be sure to scroll down the
entire list and provide as much information as you can.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4685f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Preferences Screen</p></div></div>
</p><p>Take care with the Ping section (at the very top); more often
than not, selecting either ping method (TCP or ICMP) can cause
Nessus to mistakenly decide that hosts are down when in fact they
are up. Nessus will not perform any tests on a host that doesn't
reply to pings&mdash;when in doubt, don't ping. Warning: in the Nmap
section, Linux users should select only tcp connect() and should
deselect all other scan types, due to a bug in libpcap that affects
the way Nessus performs port scans.</p><p>After Prefs comes Scan Options (Figure 5). Note that the
Nessus installation in Figure 5 was compiled with the save-session
feature, as evidenced by the Detached Scan and Continuous Scan
options, which would otherwise be absent. As in the Prefs screen,
you should deselect everything under Port scanner except Nmap tcp
connect() scan due to the bug mentioned above.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4685f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Scan Options Screen</p></div></div>
</p><p>The &ldquo;Optimize the test&rdquo; option tells Nessus to avoid all
apparently inapplicable tests, but this can result in false
negatives, at least theoretically. Think about how much that
worries you versus whether you want the scan to complete as quickly
as possible. Speaking of speed, if you care about it you probably
want to avoid using the &ldquo;Do a reverse (DNS) lookup...&rdquo; feature;
it attempts to determine the hostnames for all scanned IP
addresses.</p><p>And now it's time to specify our victims...oops, I mean
targets. We specify these in the Target(s): field of the Target
Selection screen (Figure 6). This can contain hostnames, IP
addresses and network addresses in the format
<span   class="emphasis"><em>x.x.x.x/y</em></span> (where <span   class="emphasis"><em>x.x.x.x</em></span>
is the network number and <span   class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> is the number of
bits in the subnet mask, e.g., 192.168.1.0/24) in a comma-separated
list.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4685f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. Target Selection Screen</p></div></div>
</p><p>The &ldquo;Perform a DNS zone transfer&rdquo; option instructs Nessus
to attempt to obtain all available DNS information on any domain
names or subdomain names referred to in the Target(s): box. Note,
most internet DNS servers are configured to deny zone-transfer
requests from unknown hosts. The other options in this screen have
to do with the experimental save-session feature I mentioned
earlier&mdash;see
<a href="http://www.nessus.org/documentation.html" target="_self">www.nessus.org/documentation.html</a>
for more information on what the experimental features do and how
to use them.</p><p>Finally, one last screen before we begin our scan: User (see
Figure 7). (We're skipping KB, which only applies if you've
compiled and wish to use the knowledge-base features.) In this
screen, we can change our client passphrase (this has the same
effect as nessus -C), and we can list exceptions (fine tunings,
really) of the targets we specified in the Target Selection
screen.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4685f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 7. User Screen</p></div></div>
</p><p>These exceptions are called rules, and they follow a simple
format: accept address, deny address, default accept or reject. In
Figure 7, the rules listed mean don't scan 10.193.133.60, but scan
everything else listed in the previous screen.</p><p>And now, the payoff. We click the Start the Scan button at
the bottom of the screen, and we're off. The scan's length will
vary, depending mainly on how many hosts you're scanning and how
many tests you've enabled. The end result? A report such as that
shown in Figure 1.</p><p>From the Report window, besides viewing the report and
drilling down into its various details, you can save the report to
a file. Supported report file formats include HTML, ASCII, LaTeX
and, of course, a proprietary Nessus Report format, NSR (which you
should use for reports you wish to view again within
Nessus).</p><p>Read this report carefully; be sure to expand all + boxes and
fix the things Nessus turns up. Nessus can find problems and can
even suggest solutions, but it won't fix things for you. Also,
Nessus won't necessarily find everything wrong with your
system.</p><p>It's a fact of life with security scanners; they can only do
so much, and not all plugins are equally effective at finding the
things they're supposed to find. Even to the extent they are
effective, Nessus obviously can't find vulnerabilities it doesn't
have plugins for, so be sure to update your plugins

completely free security scanner. When generated and interpreted
properly, Nessus reports can help you stay ahead of the well known
vulnerability curve. We haven't discussed how to write custom
plugins, but these allow you to test not only for commonly known
vulnerabilities but even brand-new or hitherto unknown
exploits.</p><p>Again, please, use this tool responsibly. Assuming you will,
have fun!</p></div></div>
