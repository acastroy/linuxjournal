business: the software tools we use evolve so rapidly that it's
hard to keep up with them. A year ago, I hadn't even heard of the
web-scripting language, PHP. Today I write PHP full-time at my job.
</p><p>There we have two teams: one team writes strictly PHP code
using Red Hat Linux-based PCs, and the other does strictly graphics
design using DreamWeaver on NT-based PCs. The marketing department
sketches out the pages; the graphics team builds the pages with the
data sections of the pages stubbed out. The code team takes over
and, using PHP's ability to integrate with HTML seamlessly, brings
active data into the page stubs.</p><p>And that's all fine&mdash;until someone wants to change, say, the
text on a certain submit button that appears on 46 pages throughout
the site. This means 46 changes to 46 files now have to be made
just to alter the appearance of one little button! Thank goodness
for <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>.</p><p>But there's a way to avoid all this, and that's the subject
of this article. By using HTML templates, the button mentioned
above can be fixed by making a simple change to one file. Templates
enable the physical separation of PHP code and HTML. Changes to the
PHP code in no way affect the HTML, and vice versa.</p><p>Templates operate like this: a PHP program opens and parses
external files that contain the HTML for a page. The HTML files
contain placeholders for data that will be substituted in at
runtime. The tags usually look something like: {ITEM}. When a tag
is encountered, the PHP program substitutes the right data for the
tag. This way, the PHP code files can be kept completely separate
from the HTML files, and the coders and designers don't accidently
mess up each other's work.</p><p>There are several open-source template packages available.
Some are more powerful and complicated than others. One package
that I believe strikes a good balance between speed of execution
and ease of use is FastTemplate 1.1.0 from CDI. Joe Harris, the
author, has released FastTemplate under the General Artistic
License. Joe writes in the documentation that FastTemplate 1.1.0 is
actually a PHP port of a Perl module of the same name. The Perl
module was written by Jason Moore.</p><p>The idea in using FastTemplate is to break down a web page
into its most basic components: individual buttons, checkboxes,
even lines of text. Tables must be broken down into headers and
rows, and rows must be broken into cells. Each component is given
its own file with the static HTML and a special tag for the
variable data. Then, the page is built up from these simple
components. Finally, you end up with a file like our main.tpl that
simply contains the tag, {BODY}. Some prefer to call it {CONTENT};
the exact name is immaterial. This top-level tag is replaced with
the data for the total page. If desired, it can even be the
top-level file for every page in your site. Therefore, a change to
this file will change the look of your whole site. We will do
exactly that in the example program.</p><p>There are several positive implications here. To use
templates, you need to have the exact content of all your pages
absolutely nailed down to the last detail because you are going to
be making template files for each widget on the page. This is good
because it forces you to be an engineer and makes it very difficult
to be a hacker. To add a feature after the fact will require
changes to at least three files, not just one. Your site will be
better for this because your design will be more thorough, detailed
and more carefully planned.</p><p>Early on, it seems like you are accumulating a lot of very
small template files, and while this is true, the templates are
reusable to a large extent. As the size of your application grows,
the proportion of template files shrinks. You can also put more
than one data tag in a template file. This reduces the number of
template files but also makes the template less reusable.</p><p>To appreciate what FastTemplate can do for web site
maintainability, let's see it in action. I'm assuming that you have
access to a Linux server already running Apache, PHP and a
relational database (I used MySQL), and that you can make changes
to a few files and directories normally owned by root.</p><p>Installing FastTemplate is about as easy as it gets. The home
page is
<a href="http://www.thewebmasters.net/php/FastTemplate.phtml" target="_self">www.thewebmasters.net/php/FastTemplate.phtml</a>.
Download the file FastTemplate-1_1_0.tar.gz and, if you're running
PHP 4.0, the diff file (php4.diff) as well. Move the download to
your document root and untar it. The directory, FastTemplate/, will
be created. If you're running PHP 4.0, place php4.diff in
FastTemplate/ and run these commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
patch class.FastTemplate.php3 php4.diff
mv class.FastTemplate.php3 class.FastTemplate.php
</pre><p>Then, move class.FastTemplate.php into your PHP include
directory. If you're not sure where this directory is, check the
file, php.ini. It's found in /usr/local/lib/ by default. Look for
the &ldquo;include path&rdquo; setting. It is also possible to include
class.FastTemplate.php explicitly into PHP programs with an
include( ) statement, but this takes extra work and I tend to
forget to do it. That's it for installing FastTemplate.
</p><p>Next, make another directory somewhere under your document
root for this example's files. You will need the files in Listing
1, Listing 2 and Listing 3. Listing 4 will need to be broken down
into the individual template files [see
<a href="../listings/086/" target="_self">ftp://ssc.com/pub/lj/listings/issue86/</a>].</p><p><a href="4573l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. index.php</a></p><p><a href="4573l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. mysql.php</a></p><p><a href="4573l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.
goodbye.php</a></p><p>This example, though short and simple, illustrates that
FastTemplate can easily handle a table that is dynamic in both rows
and columns. As far as individual elements of a page go, that's
about as complicated as it gets.</p><p>Look at Listing 1. To use FastTemplate, we simply include
class.FastTemplate.php and declare an instance. The (&ldquo;.&rdquo;) in our
declaration indicates that our supporting templates are found in
the current directory. They could just as easily be in another. The
FastTemplate class has four main methods: define( ), assign( ),
parse( ) and print( ).</p><p>The define( ) method maps external filenames to handles that
our program will use. Note that the templates need not end in .tpl.
You will probably need only one call to define( ) in any
program.</p><p>The assign( ) method maps the data tags (minus the {}s) to
the data we want to replace them with. There can be many assign( )
calls throughout your program. Begin by dealing with the smallest,
most basic components first and build more complex components with
them.</p><p>For me, parse( ) was the hardest method to understand. This
method parses a template, makes the data-for-tag substitution and
stores the result in a local variable. The local variable is the
first parameter to parse( ). The second parameter is the file
handle we defined in define( ). If the second parameter to parse( )
begins with a &ldquo;.&rdquo; we append the new value to the previous, if
any. We use this technique to populate the database selector in the
example. The PHP program's main muscle will be used to retrieve or
calculate data for assigning and parsing.</p><p>Finally, print( ) outputs the contents of the most recent
parse by default. We can also pass parsed results to it as a
parameter. There can be more than one print( ) on a page, and
sometimes this is the easiest way to get a page on the screen. And,
there is usually more than one way to generate a page. If it works
and it's efficient, it's good.</p><p>So let's see the example. With a browser, load the examples
in Listing 1, and you should see something like Figure 1. Select a
database with the selector, enter a query, press the EXECUTE button
and the results of your query are displayed (see Figure 2).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4573f1.large.jpg"><img src="4573f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. PHP SQL Query Test Page</p></div></div>
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4573f2.large.jpg"><img src="4573f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Output from the Test
Query</p></div></div>
</p><p>Now, assume the role of graphics designer. Your job is to
totally change the look of the entire application. Your imaginary
boss has just said that the grey background has to go&mdash;he wants it
to be yellow. And he wants everything centered on the page, not
left justified. And by the way, he wants all the text in green.
With a FastTemplate-based site, you can make all this happen in
less than a minute by editing the top-level template file,
main.tpl.</p><p>Better web editors exist, but Netscape Composer can do the
job. Here's how to do it: in Netscape Navigator, select File --&gt;
Open Page. In the dialog that appears, enter or browse the full
path to main.tpl in your example directory, and click &ldquo;Open in
Composer&rdquo;. Netscape Composer will open a large window with a
single word, {BODY}, displayed in the composer edit area (see
Figure 3). That's the HTML-rendered version of main.tpl. To make
the boss' changes, first select Edit --&gt; Select All. {BODY},
including parentheses, should be highlighted in yellow. Now select
Format --&gt; Align --&gt; Center. That takes care of centering.
Edit --&gt; Select All again. Now select Format --&gt; Text Color,
and pick a nice dark green from the swatches selector. Click OK.
You should now see {BODY} in dark green. That's two down, one to
go. Select Format --&gt; Page Colors and Properties. Select the Use
Custom Colors button in the radiogroup at the top of the Colors and
Background Tab. Then select Background. Pick yellow from the
Swatches Tab in the dialog that appears. Click OK, Apply and OK
again. Your background in Composer should already be yellow. Now
select File --&gt; Save, then File --&gt; Close.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4573f3.large.jpg"><img src="4573f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. The Main FastTemplate File Open for
Editing</p></div></div>
</p><p>Now reload the query page from the example. All three changes
should now be in effect: yellow background, green text and
everything centered, yet the application should still work
programmatically as it always did (see Figure 4 and Figure 5).
Although this example is very simple, I think the potential here is
obvious.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4573f4.large.jpg"><img src="4573f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. The New Template Is Automatically Applied

Query</p></div></div>
</p><p>There are some issues that you have to consider with
FastTemplate. For one, there are a lot of small files that must be
managed and also read from disk every time the page is accessed.
This can cause significant performance degradation on a busy site.
On sites with infrequent access, this may not be a matter for
concern. In some cases, you may wish to have a single template for
each page in your site to cut down on the number of template
files.</p><p>Benjamin Kahn is hosting a web page for an extension of
FastTemplate called Cached FastTemplate
(<a href="http://zoned.net:81/~xkahn/php/fasttemplate" target="_self">http://zoned.net:81/~xkahn/php/fasttemplate/</a>).
Cached FastTemplate adds several performance enhancing features to
FastTemplate. With this package, pages or parts of a page can be
cached in memory, and the caching rules are configurable. This is
worth checking out once you get comfortable with
FastTemplate.</p><p>As I quickly learned at my new job, it's not enough to
develop a web site that's good today. It must be scalable and
maintainable, too. HTML generators like DreamWeaver, while easy to
use, produce HTML that is downright ugly. You don't want to be
ferreting through those files looking for your PHP code. HTML
templates like FastTemplate can do a lot to enhance the quality of
life for web developers.</p></div></div>
