<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #224, December 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Developers can run into trouble if they don't follow security
procedures for submitting code. <span   class="bold"><b>Thierry
Reding</b></span> tried to send the new
<span   class="bold"><b>PWM</b></span> subsystem to <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>, only to be stopped at the gate. The
code had been under development for more than a year; it had been in
linux-next for a while already, and Linus thought the code itself
looked good.
</p><p>
But, Thierry had not participated in a key-signing event to join the
kernel developer web of trust. Without that assurance of his identity,
Linus wouldn't accept any code from him. On a more technical note,
Linus also wanted to see some &ldquo;Signed-off-by&rdquo; tags from people who
actually used the PWM subsystem.
</p><p>
The PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) subsystem works on rectangular pulse
waves of the sort needed to adjust the power signals to computer fans
and display backlights. Thierry's work was intended to 
replace the old clunky API completely, with its various restrictions and
problems, with a nice clean interface.
</p><p>
A lot of developers offered their &ldquo;Signed-off-by&rdquo; tags to Thierry's work
after that, including <span   class="bold"><b>Arnd Bergmann</b></span>, who added that the code was an
essential piece needed to build <span   class="bold"><b>ARM
kernels</b></span> for multiple platforms.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Sebastian Andrzej Siewior</b></span> also met up with Thierry and signed his GPG
key, thus indoctrinating Thierry into the web of trust. Linus accepted
the code, and kernel development proceeded.
</p><p>
Sometimes it's a good idea to use special-case data values that have a
completely different meaning from usual, and sometimes it's not.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jean Delvare</b></span> wanted to address a problem
with <span   class="bold"><b>device ID numbers</b></span>.
Sometimes, a single device type could have multiple instances on a
given system, where the actual device ID didn't really matter and
couldn't be predicted. Only one of the devices would have a meaningful
ID at any given time.
</p><p>
Jean's idea was to use negative ID numbers for those devices. Then, the
system would be able to know right away that those ID numbers were
just throw-aways that could be discarded afterward. But, users
would see only an ordinary positive ID number that they could use to
mount and unmount the device as usual.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> didn't like
&ldquo;overloading&rdquo; the device IDs in this
way. Jean's approach might be more efficient with RAM usage, because it
wouldn't be creating a whole new variable to hold the information
about which IDs were throw-aways, but it would add complexity and
messiness to the kernel.
</p><p>
So, Jean redid his patch, keeping his prized feature of having
throw-away device IDs, but using a regular old boolean variable to
identify those IDs, instead of encoding it into the sign of the
number. Greg accepted the new patch and sent it along to Linus
Torvalds for inclusion in the main tree.
</p><p>
Recently, <span   class="bold"><b>Ben Hutchings</b></span> announced that he'd decided to maintain the
<span   class="bold"><b>3.2 kernel</b></span> as a stable kernel series as a long-term commitment, at
least through 2015.
</p><p>
Typically, every kernel that's released by Linus Torvalds has a few
follow-up releases from various folks like Greg Kroah-Hartman and
others that add stability. But once in a while Greg, or Ben or really
anyone who wants to, will pick a kernel and do longer-term maintenance
on it.
</p><p>
This time, Ben had decided to support the 3.2 kernel for the rest of
the <span   class="bold"><b>Debian 7.0</b></span> life cycle, which he estimated would take him through to
the end of 2015. After that, he said, he'd either hand maintainership
over to someone else who was interested or just let that kernel drop.
</p><p>
Of course, just because he's maintaining the kernel specifically for
Debian, doesn't mean the same kernel won't run great on any other
system. The 3.2 kernel probably will come to be quite well-respected
throughout the world before it's set aside.

I love my Samsung Galaxy S2. Unfortunately, like I mentioned last month,
it's difficult to access the internal storage. FolderSync was great for
managing the internal storage, but there's a lot more to Android than
file storage. Enter: AirDroid.
</p><p>
By creating a Web server on your phone or tablet, AirDroid allows you
to connect via the browser on your desktop computer. Once connected,
AirDroid allows just about every interaction imaginable with your Android
device. With AirDroid you can:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Send SMS messages from your browser.
</p></li><li><p>
Install and remove apps.
</p></li><li><p>
Manage photos, ringtones and music.
</p></li><li><p>
Control and record the Android screen (rooted devices only).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
For managing files, I still say FolderSync is hard to beat. For every
other sort of interaction with your Android device, AirDroid is pretty
great. Plus, it's completely free! Check it out at <a href="http://www.airdroid.com" target="_self">www.airdroid.com</a>.

<h2 class="title">Gaming Like It's 1993</h2>

Two things happened in 1993: I attended my first year of college, and I
played a lot of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scorched Earth</em></span>. Oddly enough, the latter seemed to have
more of an effect on my later career choices.
</p><p>
If you're nostalgic for the good old days of Shareware software on floppy
disks, you really might enjoy the open-source <span   class="emphasis"><em>Atomic
Tanks</em></span>, which is
a modern-day clone of the old shoot 'em up tank game. Sticking remarkably
close to the original, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Atomic Tanks</em></span> looks and plays
just like the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scorched
Earth</em></span> of old. There are newer twists on the old classic, even
some open-source ones like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scorched3D</em></span> (<a href="http://www.scorched3d.co.uk" target="_self">www.scorched3d.co.uk</a>) with better graphics
and more realistic gameplay. I actually prefer <span   class="emphasis"><em>Atomic
Tanks</em></span>' retro look,
however, and if you played <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scorched Earth</em></span> from a floppy disk back in
the day, you might too. Check it out at <a href="http://atanks.sourceforge.net" target="_self">atanks.sourceforge.net</a>.

Apple has shipped an X11 application with its OS for as many versions as
I can remember. With its latest releases, however, the use of XQuartz
really has provided a seamless X Window System experience. If you want to use
the latest version of XQuartz, you'll have to get it from the Web site
(<a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org" target="_self">xquartz.macosforge.org</a>). The one Apple delivers via Software
Update isn't as new. Because Apple does include older versions of XQuartz,
it's important to know the Software Update process will write over your
newer version if you're not careful.
</p><p>
What does XQuartz provide? For me, its native X11 server means
tunneling X11 traffic over an SSH connection can be done right inside
the OS X terminal app. With older versions of OS X, you had to start X11
separately, then tunnel in with the non-native-looking Xterm. XQuartz
make the process seamless!

Every year for our Readers' Choice survey, the venerable tool rsync
gets votes for favorite backup tool. That never surprises us, because
every time I need to copy a group of files and folders, rsync is the
tool I use by default. It really has everything&mdash;local folder support,
SSH tunneling support, delta-only synchronization, speed, versatility, and
quite frankly, it's just a great program. It has everything&mdash;except a GUI.
</p><p>
Don't get me wrong; rsync works great without a GUI. I use it on the
command line almost daily. The problem with rsync's amazing power is
a rather complex set of arguments. It's possible to learn those flags,
but for the neophyte user, they can be overwhelming. That's where Grsync
really shines.
</p><p>
Grsync does a great job of turning countless command-line options into
a manageable collection of check boxes and text-entry areas. When you add
the nifty &ldquo;sessions&rdquo; feature that remembers settings along with source and
destinations, it turns into the perfect filesystem sync tool. If you've
ever felt rsync was powerful but too complex to use on a regular basis,
I highly recommend Grsync. For making such a powerful tool accessible to
the unwashed masses, Grsync gets this month's Editors' Choice Award. Now
go copy some files! See <a href="http://grsync.sourceforge.net" target="_self">grsync.sourceforge.net</a>.

<h2 class="title">Scientific Visualization with NCL</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #224, December 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Many of my previous articles have looked at software packages
that do scientific calculations and generate scientific results. But,
columns of numbers are nearly impossible to make sense of&mdash;at least, by
regular human beings. So what can you do? The answer is visualization. We
do massive amounts of processing visually, and the easiest way for us
to review information is through some graphical format. Because of the
power of graphical representations, several packages have been written
by different groups. In this article, I'm looking at NCL (the NCAR Command
Language, <a href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu" target="_self">www.ncl.ucar.edu</a>).
NCAR is the National Center for Atmospheric Research, where
the Computational and Information Systems Laboratory develops NCL. NCL
is an interpreted language designed specifically for data analysis
and visualization. It supports several different file formats used in
scientific computations, and it also provides several data analysis
functions built-in.
</p><p>
NCL is available as both source code and precompiled binaries. These
are hosted at the Earth System Grid Web site
(<a href="http://www.earthsystemgrid.org" target="_self">www.earthsystemgrid.org</a>). The first step is to get
an account on the Earth System Grid site. Once your registration is
complete, you can download either the source code or the
binaries for the system that interests you. The binaries are packaged
as tarballs, and they have been compiled for both Debian-based and Red Hat-based
systems. You can select between 32-bit and 64-bit binaries. Once you have
the correct tarball downloaded, you can unpack it in the directory of
your choice. The usual place on UNIX systems is /usr/local, but you
are free to place it anywhere on your system. 
</p><p>
After unpacking, you
need to set several environment variables before actually using
NCL. The first is the environment variable
<tt  >NCARG_ROOT</tt>. You need
to set this to the parent directory containing the NCL executables and
libraries. For example, if you unpack NCL in /usr/local, you would
set <tt  >NCARG_ROOT=/usr/local</tt>. You also need to add the location of the NCL
executables to your path. In this example, you would add
<tt  >$NCARG_ROOT/bin</tt>
or <tt  >/usr/local/bin</tt> to the PATH environment variable. You also
need to create a configuration file in your home directory, named
.hluresfile. This file will hold configuration options like the
default font and the default color table. 
</p><p>
Once everything is set up,
you quickly can test whether NCL is working correctly by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ng4ex gsun01n
</pre>
</p><p>
This command copies an NCL script file named gsun01n.ncl into
your current working directory and runs it through NCL to produce
some graphical output. 
</p><p>
If you decide to build NCL from source,
you need to install a number of extra libraries to handle all
the possible input file formats, as well as all the possible
output graphics formats. A full set of instructions is available at
<a href="http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/build_from_src.shtml" target="_self">www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/build_from_src.shtml</a>.
</p><p>
It is strongly advised that you try to use the prebuilt binaries first,
before going through all the work involved in building NCL
from scratch.
</p><p>
Now that NCL is installed and ready to use, what can you actually do
with it? If you enter the command <tt  >ncl</tt>, you will get a prompt where you
can enter commands. Entering the following command tells NCL to start
recording the commands you issue in your current NCL session:

<pre     class="programlisting">
record "my_script.ncl"
</pre>
</p><p>
When you are done, type <tt  >stop
record</tt>
to tell NCL to stop recording your session. At this point, you will have
an NCL script that you can reuse later, if you wish. 
</p><p>
Once you have your
NCL script, you can run it through NCL with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

ncl &lt;my_script.ncl

</pre>
</p><p>
This is only one way to develop an NCL script. Remember, NCL is
a full programming language, and you can write your scripts from
scratch, once you know enough of the commands that are available. 
</p><p>
The
first structure to learn is the format of an NCL script. Scripts all start
with the command <tt  >begin</tt> and finish with the command
<tt  >end</tt>. Everything
else happens between those two statements.
</p><p>
In NCL, four general groups of objects are available. The first group
is the workstation objects. These objects represent the graphical
devices that act as display devices that the graphical functions use
to draw on. These could be an X11 window, an NCAR Computer Graphics
Metafile or a PostScript file. This second group is data objects. Data objects
store the actual information used in your analysis and graphical
presentation. The third group is the view objects, which represent the elements of
your graphical representation. These might be things like text objects,
tick marks or contour plots, among others. The fourth is the group
of &ldquo;other&rdquo; objects, which includes everything else, such as overlays or
annotations. You can create new objects by using the commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
objectname = create "object_character_name" 
 &#8618;class_name parent_object
end create
</pre>
</p><p>
where you create a new object based off an existing parent object.
</p><p>
So, what does a basic graphical display look like? You can generate
something simple with the following example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
begin
x11 = create "x11" xWorkstationClass defaultapp
end create
text = create "text" textItemClass x11
end create
draw(text)
frame(x11)
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Save these commands into a file named sample1.ncl. To run it, you
can execute <tt  >ncl &lt;sample1.ncl</tt>. The first three lines create an X11 object
to draw on. The next two lines create a text object. You need the
<tt  >draw</tt> command 
to generate the text object, while the <tt  >frame</tt> command instantiates
the graphical display on your screen.
</p><p>
What if you want to import data in order to do some processing? NCL can
handle many of the file formats used in scientific computational work. As
a simple case, let's say you have some code that simply dumps the result
as an ASCII representation of the values of interest. You can load this
data with the command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
file_data = asciiread("/full/path/to/file", file_size, "float")
</pre>
</p><p>
This will read in <tt  >file_size</tt> numbers from the file given and import
them as a float type. Once you've done this, you can grab subsets using
indices and assign them to variables. For example, you could create a
new array with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
array1 = new(64, float)
</pre>
</p><p>
and then assign the first 64 elements from the file with the command:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
array1(0:63) = file_data(0:63)
</pre>
</p><p>
Graphing is a bit more complex. The first step is to create a data object
that will store the values to be graphed. For example, you could use
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
field1 = create "field1" coordArraysClass defaultapp
   "caYArray": (Y-data)
   "caXArray": (X-data)
end create
</pre>
</p><p>
where you would replace <tt  >X-data</tt> and
<tt  >Y-data</tt> with the actual data arrays
you want to use. Once this is done, you actually can do the graphing with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xy_plot = create "xy_plot" xyPlotClass wks
   "xyCoordData": field1
end create
draw(xy_plot)
frame(wks)
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates an <tt  >xy_plot</tt> object, based on the data you imported into
NCL. Next you need to run the <tt  >draw</tt> command and then
call the <tt  >frame</tt>
command to instantiate the plot. 
</p><p>
If you simply want to view the graph,
you can call <tt  >frame</tt> on an X11 display object. Or, you can save the graph
to a file by calling <tt  >frame</tt> with a file object, like a PostScript file.
</p><p>
There are many possible gotchas when writing and running NCL scripts. Many
of these will lead to inefficient code, mostly due to the fact that
NCL is an interpreted language. The first item to look at is whether
you are using loops unnecessarily. Whenever possible, you should try
to use built-in functions to do any processing, rather than try to do
the processing yourself. As an example, say you wanted to multiply two
100x100 arrays. If you did it yourself, you probably would write some
looping code like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
do i = 0,99
   do j = 0,99
      c(i,j) = a(i,j)*b(i,j)
   end do
end do
</pre>
</p><p>
In NCL, you equivalently could write:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
c = a*b
</pre>
</p><p>
This is not only shorter, it is also much more efficient. Instead of
having to go through each iteration of the loop and ending up incurring
the cost of evaluating the statements on each iteration of the loop, the
multiplication is evaluated as a single statement by NCL and is handed to
the underlying libraries that handle matrix multiplication as a single
statement. You also should try to make sure that you pull out as many
operations from the loop as possible and apply them a single time after
the loop operation is finished. Additionally, sometimes the processing you are trying
to do is simply too intensive. In those cases, you can tell NCL to load
and use external C- or FORTRAN-compiled objects to handle this processing.
</p><p>
This has been only the barest of introductions to NCL. NCL is a full
programming language, with loop structures and conditional statements. You
have variables, objects and loads of built-in functions. You can
check out all of the possibilities by visiting the NCL and Earth System
Grid Web sites. You might be surprised at the analysis that is possible.
