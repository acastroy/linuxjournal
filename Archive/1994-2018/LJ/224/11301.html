After years of exhaustive and sluggish development, the venerable
raster image editor finally has a new release.
Laden with new features and a completely new UI, the open-source image
editor tries to appeal to graphics designers. Let's take an
in-depth look at the new version of the popular editor,
GIMP.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x10ab1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Professional graphics programs always have been proprietary OS turf, but with
time and massive development, the Open Source community has made the ecosystem
an artist's resort. Ranging from boggling 3-D processing elements to 
nifty vector processing, Linux graphics editing now is mature enough to
sustain artists' enthusiasm for Linux, 
</p><p>
Until recently, GIMP's interface was very much a mixed-bag
experience&mdash;too
perplexing with a lack of efficient window control. Besides, its meager
8-bit channel support was a major hurdle in mass adoption. Finally, after
four
years of development following GIMP 2.6, developers closed the curtain on the
next major release. GIMP 2.8 surpasses the
older iteration with a more stable and feature-rich approach. 
</p><p>
On June 5, 2012, taking a huge four-year window for development,
developers finally presented the much awaited version of GIMP 2.8.
Unlike 2.6, where major changes were made in the core base of the software,
2.8 brings an overall makeover of the software stack. It features a brand-new UI with
single window mode, many nifty cosmetic changes and much awaited changes in
the core, such as support
for OpenCL hardware acceleration for improved and faster results.
</p><p>
The main idea behind the new interface is to provide smoother, more intuitive
and better manageability while working with multiple images, along with support for
higher-bit raw files and hardware acceleration, paving the way for enhanced
editing without sacrificing performance.
</p><p>
So without further ado, let's take an in-depth look at the newly refurbished
GIMP. Since there are no bug releases at the time of this writing, I am using the vanilla
variant, 2.8.0. The hardware I used for testing is based on AMD's
first-generation APU&mdash;that is, Llano 3850 with 4GB of RAM.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x10ab568"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
GEGL and BALB</b></p><p>
GEGL (Generic Graphical Library) is the new image processing core that
debuted with GIMP 2.6. GEGL provides power graphics-based array
calculations that make editing more powerful, allowing developers to
leverage high-bit-depth processing along with efficient color channels.
Support for non-destructive editing and hardware acceleration makes GEGL a
perfect library for GIMP to leverage. In future releases, GEGL will support
16-bit and 32-bit high image editing solutions.
</p><p>
BALB is a support library to GEGL that allows seamless color conversion,
making photographers and editors feel at ease when working with new
versions of GIMP.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x10ab7d0"></a>
Getting GIMP 2.8</h2></div></div><p>
GIMP is one of the premier software packages in the Linux
ecosystem, and it comes pre-installed on almost all distributions. To get the
latest version of GIMP, check your package manager. If your
distribution doesn't ship with the latest version, you can compile
it from the tarballs provided at the GIMP Web site.
</p><p>
Users looking for the latest build should grab the source from the GIMP Git
repository at <a href="http://developer.gimp.org/git.html" target="_self">developer.gimp.org/git.html</a>; however, in order to
maintain compatibility, you must ensure that all dependencies, such as 
GEGL and BALB, also are updated.
</p><p>
The best part about GIMP is its light nature. The
application is uniquely positioned and designed so that it can run on
any hardware without any glitches, and the measly install and package size
makes it pocket-friendly software, so if you want to carry it around, you
can have an installation of GIMP in your portable driver.
</p><p>
The first notable change in the GIMP is the splash screen. Developers have
now opted for a wider and bigger screen, much different from the long flat
splashes that debuted with older iterations. Once the application opens
though,
you will notice the same old floating windows and docks.
The developers have refrained from switching completely to single window mode with
this release.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11301f1.large.jpg"><img src="11301f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x10abbf0"></a>
Single Window Mode</h2></div></div><p>
The most touted feature that initially was set to
debut with GIMP 2.10, finally arrives for mass adoption and testing.
Single window mode is disabled by default, but you can enable it from
Windows&rarr;single window mode. Once you have enabled the option, GIMP will wrap
all the floating boxes into a single entity making it smoother and
more efficient to work with. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11301f2.large.jpg"><img src="11301f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Single Window Mode in GIMP 2.8
</p></div></div><p>
To position GIMP more uniquely in the competitive software ecosystem, developers
have opted for a more intuitive approach, which is reminiscent of other
major software solutions. The single window mode is more efficient and
works
across all desktop environments, unlike the Utility Window that debuted with
GIMP 2.6, which had issues with the KDE Kwin windows manager. Even in single
window mode, you can customize the GIMP toolboxes the way you like, so the
liberty to change GIMP according to your tastes still holds true.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x10abf60"></a>
Tabbed Navigation</h2></div></div><p>
The other major UI change 
is the tabbed view. Often photographers and designers work
with multiple images, so it usually is cumbersome for an artist to work
with multiple windows. To tackle this issue and provide an easy way
to switch back and forth when dealing with multiple images, GIMP has come up
with a tabbed view of all the active windows.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11301f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Tabbed Image View in GIMP
</p></div></div><p>
The tabbed view sits on top of the editing canvas and displays a small
thumbnail preview of all the active windows&mdash;an efficient way to toggle
between multiple images. It's a feature that isn't very new among graphics
editors, but it still is a worthy add-on for multitasking with images easily.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x10ac278"></a>
Other UI Changes</h2></div></div><p>
Major UI changes have overshadowed most of the new release's 
makeover; however, the developers have paid close attention and
fine-tuned some smaller areas and made changes where they matter most:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Multi-column dock: with previous versions, it was possible
to group multiple docks together in a tabbed view, but with GIMP 2.8, developers
are allowing users to dock the window sideways or in vertical view.
The ability to stack
multiple docks is a nice way to let users 
modify the look and feel freely according to their own needs and working
area.
</p></li><li><p>
Transparency slider: GIMP 2.8 brings a new transparency
slider to the table. Initially suggested with the GIMP usability project, the
new idea saw daylight with the final release. The changes are
tailor-made to target users with tablets and those who use a stylus or pen for
drawing and painting with the GIMP.
</p></li><li><p>
Additional space for toolboxes: the docking bars now
have more area and less unused space. Developers have removed the top
unused area and done away with the tab information that took up a lot of
space. As a result, toolboxes are more efficient and have less
clutter.
</p></li><li><p>
Save and export features: GIMP's latest release has two new
ways to save files. The previous save feature worked for saving both
GIMP's native .xcf files (that save all the detailed information) along
with native MIME image formats, such as .png, .jpg and so on. With GIMP
2.8, the save
feature will save images only in GIMP's native .xcf format.
To save images in MIME image formats, you have to choose the Export option
from the file menu.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11301f4.large.jpg"><img src="11301f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
That sums up GIMP's changes in the user interface
department. However, many bold changes in the new release
not only enhance the editing experience but also pave the way for
future GIMP development.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x10acc18"></a>
Layer Grouping</h2></div></div><p>
The most painful part in editing and creating huge images
are layers. An image is an amalgamation of many layers, and managing images
with many layers can be a daunting task. To provide an easy workaround, GIMP
2.8 boasts layer grouping features. You simply create a new group, and if
you want to add layers, simply drag and drop into the layer group.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11301f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Layer Grouping with Multiple Layers Grouped
</p></div></div><p>
Inside the layer group, you can carry out all the generic layer-related
tasks,
so these new groups don't limit your editing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x14a51d8"></a>
Resource Tagging</h2></div></div><p>
Tagging is an efficient way to locate data, especially if
you have several plugins, brushes and gradients installed. GIMP 2.8 lets
you easily tag resources that allow you to navigate quickly through the massive
resources at your disposal.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x14a52e0"></a>
On-Canvas Text Editing</h2></div></div><p>
This feature created great hoopla with the GIMP
2.8 release. On-canvas editing, which was part of a project
from Google's Summer of Code 2011, allows you to edit text directly in the
canvas&mdash;no
more pop-up boxes for adding text to images. The main advantage of the on-canvas
editor is to provide a clutter-free and more precise experience. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11301f8.large.jpg"><img src="11301f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x14a55a0"></a>
Cairo Adoption</h2></div></div><p>
All on-canvas tools, such as perspective transformation,
shear, rotate and scale tools, are redrawn using the Cairo graphics
library. As a result, the tools look more professional, and they carry a
new on-canvas status indicator and no longer use the ubiquitous status bar at the
bottom.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x14a5700"></a>
GEGL and OpenCL Implementation</h2></div></div><p>
Starting with GIMP 2.6, GEGL has come
a long way with major improvements. The most important is support for
OpenCL. With support from AMD and a GSOC project, GIMP now scales with
graphics processors for image processing, which makes a normal image
function much faster.
</p><p>
GIMP, being an image editor, requires you to work with array variables and even
multiprocessing capabilities are needed to complete tasks quickly; however, with
the advent of SIMD-based processors (graphics card/processors) and OpenCL,
it is now much easier for graphics-intense applications to leverage their
work on SIMD engines for faster processing. 
</p><p>
However, the current state of GEGL/OpenCL is dismal in Linux. GEGL doesn't
scale well, and in fact, it performs much slower when compared to plain
CPU-based processing. This could very well be the AMD driver's fault, as its
OpenCL support and performance in Linux is still flaky.
</p><p>
GEGL also has developed support for higher-bit image processing, which is
still in development and should debut with GIMP 2.10. Developers have
already laid out a plan for fully functional and complete GEGL integration
with GIMP 2.10, so in future releases, all the functions will be done in
parallel using OpenCL code stack.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfb3580.0x14a5968"></a>
Closing Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>
With many nifty add-ons, such as mathematical calculations in resize windows,
improved cage transformation tools and API changes for simplified script
writing, GIMP 2.8 has come a long way and is a far cry from its older
versions. 
</p><p>
The revamped UI and new underlying code have given GIMP a much-needed
momentum. With GIMP 2.8, developers have covered many milestones, providing
a more enhanced interface along with bleeding-edge OpenCL acceleration.
</p><p>
However, GEGL support and the dismal OpenCL performance, at least under
Linux,
have kept me thinking. With refinements every day, I believe that with GIMP
2.10, we
will have full-blown OpenCL-accelerated image editing. 
</p><p>
Looking forward, GIMP 2.10 and 3.0 will bring an even more massive
changelog,
making it a worthy competitor to proprietary solutions. With GIMP 2.8,
developers have cleared many hurdles that hindered its mass adoption. The
clunky interface is more usable and intuitive than ever. GIMP
2.8 establishes itself as one of the premier open-source alternatives
to proprietary solutions, providing bleeding-edge solutions with
an intuitive interface and an ever-improving ecosystem.
