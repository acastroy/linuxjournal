    Tcl/Tk offers many uses to the web programmer. Mr. Schongar
    describes a few of them.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f9c3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>While many people think of Tcl/Tk (Tool
Command Language, pronounced &ldquo;tickle&rdquo;; Tk stands for TCL toolkit)
as a great tool for cross-platform GUI (graphical user interface)
applications, not as many consider it for web programming tasks.
The truth is, its ease of use and flexibility make it a natural
choice for CGI (common gateway interface), server-parsed embedded
scripting, applications delivered through a plug-in, and even as a
tool for creating your own web server from the ground up.
</p><p>I will present examples of Tcl at work in these situations
and also some ideas and additional ways Tcl can be used for
whatever web programming task is needed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f9c500"></a>CGI Basics in Tcl</h2></div></div><p>Reading environment variables and printing to standard output
are the building blocks of CGI. Sure, you want to deal with
incoming data, run fun processes and format the output, but first
things first. By understanding how any given language performs the
basic tasks, you can start building things that actually do
something without spending a lot of time mired in details.</p><p><a href="3114l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> is a simple script
in Tcl that reads the environment variables set by the web server
and sends them back as HTML output to the user. The first thing to
note is the choice of shell for interpreting the script. Tcl/Tk
distributions include two shells:
<span   class="bold"><b>wish</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>tclsh</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>wish</b></span> is the &ldquo;windowing&rdquo; shell,
and it carries the overhead of initializing the GUI functions,
consuming more than double the system resources of its
command-line-only counterpart. For this article, I'm assuming you
are running version 8.0 or later of Tcl. (Check by running tclsh
and then typing <b  >info tclversion</b>.)</p><p>Next, a standard header is sent back to let the browser know
what type of information is coming. In the Listing 1 script, the
browser learns the data is HTML text rather than plain text, an
image or something else entirely. <b  >puts</b> is the
Tcl equivalent of Perl <b  >print</b> or C
<b  >printf</b>, complete with <b  >\n</b> for
newlines, and the output can be redirected to a file instead of the
default standard out (stdout). So, once the script has told the
browser that the input is HTML, it provides the HTML, in this case
a title tag and text.</p><p>To print out every environment variable, we need to generate
a list of which ones exist, then loop through and write out the
names and their values. Doing this requires a better sense of how
Tcl treats variables and executes commands. First, Tcl doesn't care
too much about what type of data is stored in a variable&mdash;text or
numbers of any length are just fine. Second, variables in Tcl come
in three forms: a single variable, an array and a formatted list.
To see how these work, look at the following lines of code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set foo "123abc"
set junk(1) "a"
set junk(2) "b"
set bar "a b c d e f g h i j"
</pre><p>The <b  >set</b> function is used to create or
modify the values of a variable. In this case,
<b  >foo</b> is a single variable while
<b  >junk</b> is an array and <b  >bar</b> is a
list. What makes <b  >bar</b> a list is that each
character is separated from the other by a space, allowing certain
TCL functions to automatically parse the data.
</p><p>When you see something in square brackets in a Tcl program,
it is normally being used to execute what is contained in those
brackets, and to substitute the return value for the entire
expression. For example, if I have a function called
<span   class="bold"><b>countdown</b></span> which returns the number
of seconds remaining until the year 2000, I can easily display that
result by writing <b  >puts&nbsp;[countdown]</b> in my
Tcl code. If it returns 300, the number 300 is printed. There are
exceptions to this general rule, of course, and we'll run into one
of them when we get to parsing user input. So, the line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set mylist [array names env]
</pre><p>means &ldquo;create a variable named <b  >mylist</b> and
set it to the result of the command <b  >array names
env</b>&rdquo;.
</p><p>Arrays are useful for related groups of information, such as
environment variables. The &ldquo;array&rdquo; group of functions allows you
to search through the names of array elements, as well as many
other helpful operations. Executing the command <b  >array
names junk</b> will make a list of all the element names in
the array, which right now would be &ldquo;1 2&rdquo;. By telling Tcl you
want to look through the <b  >env</b> array, you obtain a
list of names for all the environment variables set by the server,
and you store that list in the variable
<b  >mylist</b>.</p><p>Looping through each item in <b  >mylist</b> is
made easy by the <span   class="bold"><b>foreach</b></span> command.
It automatically parses a Tcl list and assigns the value of the
current element to the variable name you specify. In Listing 1, the
name of each environment variable will be stored in
<b  >foo</b> when its time comes, and the
<b  >puts</b> line will show the name of the variable as
it originally appeared, followed by its interpreted value. The
&ldquo;$&rdquo; sign indicates to Tcl that this is a variable and its value
should be substituted.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f9d210"></a>Processing User Data</h2></div></div><p>Since you'll want to do more than just print out some
environment variables or static data, here's how to process
incoming data in Tcl. The first step involves getting access to the
environment variables, which we've covered. This will tell us
whether the data is coming in by the
<span   class="bold"><b>GET</b></span> method, stored in the
<b  >QUERY_STRING</b> environment variable, or as a
<span   class="bold"><b>POST</b></span>, stored in standard input.
Let's find out using the slightly modified version of our previous
program shown in <a href="3114l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>. Yes,
this program is a lot longer. The extra length, however, comes from
dealing with getting the user input, formatting it and storing it
in an array. Once I explain how those parts work, I'll show you a
much shorter way of writing this program.</p><p>The parse (<span   class="bold"><b>cgiParse</b></span>) and
decoding (<span   class="bold"><b>urlDecode</b></span>) procedures
are taken from Brent Welch's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Practical Programming in
Tcl/Tk</em></span>, with minor modifications. The parse routine is
reasonably straightforward. It determines whether the data is
stored in <b  >QUERY_STRING</b> or standard input, then
stores it into a variable called <b  >text</b>.</p><p>Special characters can cause problems for CGI programs, so
the server encodes percent signs and slashes as their hexadecimal
equivalents and spaces as plus signs. Your program must convert the
data to its original form. Doing that in C and other languages can
be difficult, but Tcl makes it fairly easy. As you can see, each
time data is being processed, either for the name or value of the
variable, that data is sent to urlDecode. There, the
<span   class="bold"><b>regsub</b></span> command works its magic. To
use it, specify (in this order) a search pattern, the original
data, its replacement and the variable in which to store it.</p><p>Notice that the <b  >foreach</b> loop at the end of
the cgiParse procedure is doing two things that our previous
foreach loop didn't do. First, it is specifying more than one
temporary value for use in each loop. That is, the first time
through the loop, element 1 of the list will be stored in
<b  >name</b>, and element 2 will be stored in
<b  >value</b>. The next loop will use elements 3 and 4,
and so on. Any number of variables can be specified in this way,
which makes processing long lists a breeze. The second thing it is
doing differently is directly using the results of a command as the
list, rather than creating a variable to hold the list first. You
can do it either way, but in this example you save a fractional bit
of processing time and memory.</p><p>Once the parsing and decoding libraries have been laid out,
the program starts its run. The content header is sent to the
browser, and cgiParse is run in order to store all user-entered
values (from a form or some other way) into the variable array
<span   class="bold"><b>cgi</b></span>. Then it loops through each
element in the cgi array and prints out the names and values of all
the elements.</p><p>One benefit to the way the parsing functions are set up is
that you can test user-input values on the command line. Since it
doesn't rely on finding a GET or POST method, it will get the data
wherever possible, defaulting to the command line. So, you could
easily test your cgi script before uploading it to the server,
without having to create an elaborate wrapper to set environment
variables.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f9d9a0"></a>Function Libraries&mdash;Yours and Everyone
Else's</h2></div></div><p>Tcl procedures, or procs, are your subroutines. If you have
created some procs, you can easily put them in their own Tcl
script, then use the <span   class="bold"><b>source</b></span>
command to load those scripts so they are ready for use. To keep
your code to a minimum, you may want to use the cgiParse and
urlDecode routines shown in Listing 2. If you saved them as
&ldquo;cgistuff.tcl&rdquo;, you could rewrite the script in Listing 2
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/tclsh
source cgistuff.tcl
puts "Content-type: text/html \n\n"
cgiParse
foreach foo [array names cgi] {
   puts "Variable: $foo Value: $cgi($foo)"
}
</pre><p>The source command loads and executes a Tcl script, so be
careful that you don't have any unwanted commands hiding in that
script outside of a procedure.
</p><p>Before you go off writing too many of your own procedures,
though, you'll want to take a look at what is already available. A
lot of talented people have put time and effort into writing
well-documented, very functional procedure libraries, such as Don
Libes' cgi.tcl library, which covers everything from basic parsing
to cookies and file uploads. (See Resources.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f9dc08"></a>Data Handling</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes the data you need doesn't come from the user.
Product catalogs, maps, schedules and more all come from some sort
of external data file, whether real databases like Oracle or
Informix or something as simple as a delimited ASCII file. No
matter what your data needs are, Tcl can help you out.</p><p>Flat files are the easiest to deal with. Open a file, read
through line by line until you reach the end or find what you are
looking for, then close the file. In Tcl, reading in a file line by
line looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set f [open foo.txt r]
while {[gets $f stuff] != -1} {
  # Do something with the line
  # of data
  (`stuff')
}
close $f
</pre><p>Just as in Perl or C, you create a file handle from which all
subsequent operations work. The
<span   class="bold"><b>gets</b></span> command grabs one line at a
time from a file and stores it to a variable. If the return value
from gets is 1, you've reached the end of the file. So what do you
do with the data once you have it? For the most part, you're going
to become fast friends with the
<span   class="bold"><b>split</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>lindex</b></span> commands.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>split</b></span> breaks up a string,
either character-by-character or at every occurrence of specified
characters and returns a new list of the elements. If you want to
access specific elements of the list, lindex allows you to specify
the list and the element's position and returns that element's
value. Note that elements are numbered starting at 0, so an index
value of 1 points to the second element in a list.</p><p>A bit higher on the effort scale is processing a special
database format, such as a dBASE file or some other defined
database format. You may be fortunate enough to find existing
filters for this kind of file (two different filters exist for
dBASE files), but if you need to write your own, Tcl 8.0 handles
binary data quite well. Use the
<span   class="bold"><b>read</b></span> command to grab whatever size
byte blocks you want, then use <b  >binary scan</b> to
quickly break up and format it.</p><p>If you're concerned about speed or already have a C routine
to parse your external data, Tcl makes it easy to create new Tcl
commands encapsulated in loadable libraries. For most functions,
it's as easy as cutting and pasting into the library framework
provided by Tcl and adding some Tcl-specific commands to create or
set variables.</p><p>When you get to the top of the database world and are dealing
with Oracle or Informix, you're already covered. Tcl extensions
have been made for Oracle, Informix and probably others by the time
you read this article. Most of them provide access to the SQL layer
for the database, but you can also access the lower-level functions
of the system. All of them are available on-line, although
compiling them sometimes requires access to the commercial
libraries shipped with your RDBMS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f94a18"></a>Client-Server CGI</h2></div></div><p>One problem with basic CGI is that it doesn't provide for
real persistence. Sure, you can use cookies, file-based data on the
server side or append horribly long strings to the URL, but none of
those is an ideal solution. In addition, if you're loading things
like inventory data from a database, you have to account for
initialization time and overhead every time the script is
run.</p><p>In some situations, the best solution is to have a secondary
server process running that shares data with Tcl through sockets in
a true client-server fashion. In that way, your server could load
the needed information and become a persistent data store, for
whatever purpose. In Tcl, that's an easier task than you might
expect. While the actual code is too lengthy to include in this
article, I'll include an overview here and will be happy to provide
additional details by e-mail (bills@multimedia.com).</p><p>Sockets in Tcl are designed to be easy to use. The
<span   class="bold"><b>socket</b></span> command is used by
applications wanting to establish a listening post on a port, as
well as clients that want to connect to any server, Tcl or
otherwise. How would you listen on a port? Just use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
socket -server sayHello 9999
</pre><p>Now you have a server listening on port 9999 that will
execute the Tcl procedure <b  >sayHello</b> whenever a
new client connects. What if you want an asynchronous socket? Use:
<pre     class="programlisting">
socket -server -async sayHello 9999
</pre>


When clients want to connect to you, they just point to your IP
address and port using the socket command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
socket 10.0.0.1 9999
</pre>


When <span   class="bold"><b>sayHello</b></span> executes, it
receives three arguments: the socket channel your Tcl server has
opened to the client, the IP address of the client and the client's
port. You can configure the socket channel for the type of
buffering and blocking you want, and you'll normally set up a
<b  >fileevent</b> for the channel. A
<b  >fileevent</b> is used to generate notification when
the channel becomes either readable or writable (your choice or use
both), so that you don't have to poll the socket for new data all
the time. Now you and the client are ready to exchange information.
</p><p>So, once you've decided on what your server will do, your CGI
program can parse the data as usual, quickly establish a socket
connection, and then let the server process the information.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f94f40"></a>Extending the Client&mdash;Tcl/Tk Plug-in</h2></div></div><p>For some projects, you may want to do more than the browser
is able to support. By providing the end user with a plug-in, you
get the benefits of being able to run a real application right
inside their existing browser without too much of a hassle. One
drawback to most plug-ins is that they run only under Microsoft
Windows, making them unsuitable for real cross-platform work. Tcl's
plug-in doesn't have this problem&mdash;you can download precompiled
binaries for Linux, Solaris, SunOS and yes, even MS Windows. You
may also find that by the time you read this, it has been ported to
other platforms as well, such as the Macintosh OS.</p><p>Using the plug-in, you can run
<span   class="bold"><b>Tclets</b></span>, which are small Tcl/Tk
scripts that run in a restricted (for security reasons) Tcl
environment. You and your users can define just how much access you
want the plug-in to provide, eliminating or rerouting commands and
situations which could be hazardous to your machine's
health.</p><p>Once you have a Tclet created and your users have the Tcl
plug-in, reference it in an HTML page using the</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;EMBED SRC&gt;
</pre><p>tag. So, if your Tclet is called foo.tcl, the tag would look
like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;embed src="foo.tcl" width=400 height=300&gt;
</pre>


If you're wondering what kinds of things have already been made to
take advantage of the plug-in, look no further than
http://www.tcltk.com/tclets/, which contains everything from Tetris
clones to Adaptive Optics demonstrations and VRML editors.

and More</h2></div></div><p>Server-parsed HTML has been around for awhile, ranging from
basic server-side includes (SSI) to integrated environments
complete with database access. It provides dynamically-generated
HTML pages without the overhead of calling an external CGI program,
and makes it easy even for non-programmers to access all the
functionality it provides.</p><p>Typically, when a file with a special extension such as .foo
is referenced, the server scans through the HTML and looks for
special tags. When those tags are found, it executes whatever
instructions they contain, then replaces those sections in the
document with the output from the command. Those tags could be
anything from the current date to a dynamically generated HTML
table with a product price list.</p><p>Several solutions exist for using Tcl as a server-parsed
scripting language. Two of the most powerful commercial products
are NeoWebScript from NeoSoft and Velocigen for Tcl from Binary
Evolution. Both products extend the Apache web server with an
in-process module, so that they are running all the time in wait
mode, ready to do their work. One big difference between the two is
that while Velocigen follows the common trend of using a special
file extension to identify a file which needs parsing, NeoWebScript
follows the more traditional SSI structure of embedding the command
in comments. Examples are shown in <a href="3114l3.html" target="_self">Listing
3</a> and <a href="3114l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>.</p><p>With these more advanced server-side parsers, you can also
obtain a level of data persistence through internal variables. For
example, you could make a web scavenger hunt on your site to keep a
list of the visited pages, and when all the required ones have been
seen by a particular user, that user wins. Wins what? I don't
know&mdash;let marketing worry about it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f95518"></a>Web Servers in Tcl</h2></div></div><p>You won't be able to go out and compete with Apache for
market share, but web servers created in Tcl are easy to write,
extensible and portable across all platforms. As we saw earlier,
sockets are easy to implement in Tcl, which gives you more time to
focus on customizing the server to meet your needs, rather than
spending it on getting the basics to work.</p><p>If you want to see a nice implementation of this concept,
take a look at Tcl-HTTPD, freely available from Scriptics. It has
CGI support, server-parsed scripting and a host of dynamic
configuration options, just to name a few aspects. More basic
examples are also available from a variety of Tcl sources on the
web, as well as an excellent article by Steve Ball and a white
paper by Brent Welch. (See Resources.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f95678"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Tcl provides an easy way of addressing almost any web
programming issue. With a large development community, a wide
selection of extensions and freely available function libraries, it
is a web power tool waiting to be discovered. Whether client- or
server-side, you get a lot of options without a lot of
hassle.</p><p><a href="3114s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
