    Mr. Hamilton tells us how to use HTMLgen, a Python-class
    library, for generating HTML.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a18580.0x2b10450"></a></h2></div></div><p>This article is about using HTMLgen, a
Python-class library for generating HTML. Python is an
object-oriented scripting language that ships with most Linux
distributions. It plays a major role in configuration and
management for distributions such as Caldera and Red Hat. HTMLgen
is an add-on Python module written by Robin Friedrich, and
available from http://starship.python.net/lib.html under a
BSD-style freeware license.
</p><p>HTMLgen provides classes to support all the standard HTML 3.2
tags and attributes. It can be used in any situation where you need
to dynamically generate HTML. For example, you might want to format
the results of a database query into an HTML table, or generate an
HTML order form customized for each client.</p><p>I'll introduce HTMLgen by using it to format data found on
typical Linux systems. I think the examples are sufficiently
straightforward that they can be followed by anyone familiar with
HTML and scripting, and without prior knowledge of Python. Just
remember that in Python, blocks of statements are indicated by
indenting the code&mdash;there are no begin/end statements and no curly
braces. (In Python, WYSIWYG applies.) Other than this, Python code
looks much like that found in any mainstream programming
language.</p><p>Although Perl is the most commonly used web scripting
language, I personally prefer Python. It can achieve results
similar to Perl, and I think Python's syntax, coupled with the
style established by its user community, leads to a cleaner,
simpler style of coding. This is an advantage during both
development and maintenance. These same strengths provide a gentler
learning curve for new players. Python moves a little away from
traditional scripting languages and more toward non-scripting,
procedural programming languages. This allows Python scripting to
scale well. When a small set of scripts starts to grow to the size
of a full-blown application system, the language will support the
transition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a18580.0x2b10660"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>Any Python program needing HTMLgen must import it as a
module. Starting from <span   class="bold"><b>bash</b></span>, here's
how I set up and import HTMLgen to create a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; web
page:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bash$ export PYTHONPATH=/local/HTMLgen:$PYTHONPATH
bash$ python
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import HTMLgen
 &gt;&gt;&gt; doc = HTMLgen.SimpleDocument(title="Hello")
 &gt;&gt;&gt; doc.append(HTMLgen.Heading(1, "Hello World"))
 &gt;&gt;&gt; print doc
</pre><p>First, I set the PYTHONPATH to include the directory where
the HTMLgen.py module can be found. Then, I start the Python
interpreter and use its command-line interface to import the
HTMLgen module. I create a document object called doc and add a
heading to it.
</p><p>Finally, I print the doc object which dumps the following
HTML to standard output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"&gt;
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;!-- This file generated using HTMLgen module.
--&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
 &lt;META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="HTMLgen 2.0.6"&gt;
 &lt;TITLE&gt;Hello World&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Hello World&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt; &lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p><a href="2986f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Table&mdash;Code in Listing 1</b></span></a></p><p>This is a start, although not an exciting one. HTMLgen is a
very good tool for generating HTML tables and lists. The table in
Figure 1 was created by the Python script in
<a href="2986l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. The data in the table
comes from the Linux /proc/interrupts file which details the IRQ
interrupts for your Linux PC. On my PC, doing a
<span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> of /proc/interrupts
yields:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
0: 2348528 timer
1: 42481 keyboard
2: 0 cascade
3: 47735 + serial
4: 75428 + serial
5: 48 soundblaster
8: 0 + rtc
11: 1 NE2000
13: 1 math error
14: 175816 + ide0
15: 216 + ide1
</pre><p>The Python script reads the contents of the /proc/interrupts
file and copies the data into an HTML table. I'll describe this
process step by step. As in the previous example, I first create a
simple document. I then add an HTMLgen table to the document:
<pre     class="programlisting">
table = HTMLgen.Table( tabletitle='Interrupts',
 border=2, width=100, cell_align"right",
 heading=[ "Description", "IRQ",
"Count" ])
 doc.append(table)
</pre>


When creating the table object, I set some optional attributes by
supplying them as named arguments. The final headings argument sets
the list of column headings that HTMLgen will use. All of the above
arguments are optional.
</p><p>Once I've set up my table, I open the /proc/interrupts file
and use the <span   class="bold"><b>readlines</b></span> method to
read in its entire contents. I use a <b  >for</b> loop to
step through the lines returned and turn them into table rows.
Inside the loop, the string and regular expressions functions are
used to strip off leading spaces and split up each line into a list
of three data values based on space and colon (:)
separators:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
data=regsub.split(string.strip(line),'[ :+]+')
</pre><p>Elements of the data list are processed to form a table row
by reordering them into a new three-element list consisting of
name, number and total calls:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[ HTMLgen.Text(data[2]), data[0], data[1] ]
</pre>


The outer enclosing square brackets construct a list out of the
comma-separated arguments. The first list element,
<b  >data[2]</b>, is the interrupt name. The interrupt
name is a non-numeric field, so I've taken the precaution of
escaping any characters that might be special to HTML by passing it
though the HTMLgen Text filter. The resulting list is made into a
row of the table by appending the list to the table's body:
<pre     class="programlisting">
table.body.append(
        [ HTMLgen.Text(data[2]), data[0], data[1] ])
</pre>


Finally, once all lines have been processed, the document is
written to interrupts.html. The result is shown in Figure 1.
</p><p>The simple Table class is designed for displaying rows of
data such as might be returned from a database query. For more
sophisticated tables, the TableLite object offers a lower-level
table construction facility that includes the ability to do
individual row/column customization, column/row spanning and nested
tables.</p><p><a href="2986f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Bar
Chart&mdash;Code in Listing 2</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a18580.0x2b11058"></a>Bar Charts from HTML Tables</h2></div></div><p>The table facilities have also been extended to create fancy
bar charts. Figure 2 shows a bar chart I generated from the output
of the Linux <span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span> command. The chart
was created by the HTMLgen bar-chart module. The code for psv.py is
the 20 lines of Python code shown in
<a href="2986l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>. The original output
from <b  >ps v</b> looks something like the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PID TTY STAT TIME PAGEIN TSIZ DSIZ RSS LIM %MEM COMMA
 555 p1 S 0:01 232 237 1166 664 xx 2.1 -tcsh
1249 p2 S 0:00 424 514 2613 1676 xx 5.4 xv ps
 ...
</pre><p>I use the Python operating system module's
<span   class="bold"><b>popen</b></span> function to return a file
input pipe for the output stream from the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
inpipe = os.popen("ps vax", "r");
</pre>


I then read in the first line from the input pipe and split it into
a list of column names.
<pre     class="programlisting">
colnames = string.split(inpipe.readline())
</pre>


Now, I create the chart object, and the chart object's datalist
object:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chart = barchart.StackedBarChart()
...
chart.datalist = barchart.DataList()
</pre>


Datalists can have multiple data segments per bar, which results in
a stacked bar chart such as the one in Figure 2. I need to tell the
datalist object how many data segments are present by setting the
list of <b  >segment_names</b>. I decided the bars on my
chart will have two segments, one for TSIZ (program text memory
size) and one for DSIZ (program data memory size). To accomplish
this, I need to copy the two column names from
<b  >colnames</b> into <b  >segment_names</b>.
Because lists in Python are numbered from zero, the two
<b  >colnames</b> I'm interested in are columns 5 (TSIZ)
and 6 (DSIZ). I can extract them from the
<b  >colnames</b> list with a single slicing statement:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chart.datalist.segment_names = colnames[5:7]
data = chart.datalist
</pre>


The <b  >[5:7]</b> notation is a slicing notation. In
Python, you can slice single items and ranges of items out of
strings, lists and other sequence data types. The notation
<b  >[low:high]</b> means slice out a new list from low
to high minus 1. On the second line, I assign the variable called
&ldquo;data&rdquo; to the variable &ldquo;chart.datalist&rdquo; to shorten the length
of the following lines to fit the column width required in
<i  >Linux Journal</i>.
</p><p>After initializing the chart, I use a <b  >for</b>
loop to read the remaining lines from the
<span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span> output pipe. I extract the
columns I need by using <b  >string.split(line)</b> to
break the line into a list of columns. I extract the text of each
command by taking all the words from column 10 onward and joining
them into a new <b  >barname</b> string:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
barname = string.join(cols[10:], " " )
</pre><p>I use the string module's
<span   class="bold"><b>atoi</b></span> function to convert the ASCII
strings in the numeric fields to integers. The last statement in
the loop assembles the data into a tuple:
<pre     class="programlisting">
( barname, tsize, dsize )
</pre>


A tuple is a Python structure much like a list, except that a tuple
is immutable&mdash;you cannot insert or delete elements from a tuple.
Although the two are similar, their differences lead to quite
different implementation efficiencies. Python has both a tuple and
a list, because this allows the programmer to choose the one most
appropriate to the situation. Many features of Python and its
modules are designed to be high-level interfaces to services that
are then implemented efficiently in compiled languages such as C.
This allows Python to be used for computer graphics programming
using OpenGL and for numerical programming using fast numerical
libraries.
</p><p>Back to the example. The last statement in the loop inserts
the tuple into the chart's datalist.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
data.load_tuple(( barname, tsize, dsize ))
</pre><p>When the last line is processed, the loop terminates and I
sort the data in decreasing order of TSIZ:
<pre     class="programlisting">
data.sort(key=colnames[5], direction="decreasing")
</pre>


After that, I create the final document and save it to a file.
<pre     class="programlisting">
doc = HTMLgen.SimpleDocument(title='Memory')
doc.append(chart)
doc.write("psv.html")
</pre>


Loading psv.html into a browser results in the chart seen in Figure
2. By altering the bar chart's parameters, such as the GIFs used
for the chart's &ldquo;atoms&rdquo;, I can build the chart in different
styles.
</p><p><a href="2986f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. HTML
Page Generated by Listing 3</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a18580.0x2b085f8"></a>Multiple Documents</h2></div></div><p>In my next example, I'll show you how a data stream can be
processed to produce a series of documents that are interlinked.
The script in <a href="2986l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a> creates a
set of two documents summarizing all the Red Hat packages installed
on a Linux system. The resulting HTML page is shown in Figure 3. An
index document summarizes the RPM major groups, and a second main
document summarizes the RPMs in each group. A link for each group
in the index document jumps directly to each group's entries in the
main document.</p><p>The HTML is generated from the output of the following
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -q -a --queryformat \
   '%{group} %{name} %{summary}\n'
</pre><p>The output typically looks like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
System/Base sh-utils GNU shell utilities.
Browser/WWW lynx tty WWW browser
Programming/Tools make GNU Make.
System/Library xpm X11 Pixmap Library
System/Shell pdksh Public Domain Korn Shell
</pre>


I read this output into a Python list and pre-process it by sorting
it into alphabetic order.
</p><p>I produce two documents, an index document
(<b  >idoc</b>), and a main document
(<b  >mdoc</b>), using HTMLgen's SeriesDocument to give
both documents the same look-and-feel. By using a SeriesDocument, I
can configure standard document headers, footers and navigation
buttons via an <b  >rcfile</b> and other optional
arguments.</p><p>The index document (<b  >idoc</b>) has only one
HTMLgen component: an HTML list of RPM groups. I've used the
<b  >HTMLgen.List</b> columns option to create a
multi-column list:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ilist = HTMLgen.List(style="compact", columns=3)
idoc.append(ilist)
</pre><p>The <b  >for</b> loop processes each line from the
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> command and generates both
<b  >idoc</b> and <b  >mdoc</b> text. Each time
the group name changes, I add a new list entry to the ilist:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if group != lastgroup:
 lastgroup = group
 title = HTMLgen.Text(group)
 href = HTMLgen.Href(mainfile+"#"+ group,
        title)
 index.append(href)
</pre>


I've wrapped the list text in an HTML-named HREF, linking it back
into <b  >mdoc</b>. I've used the name of the main file
and group title to form the HREF link. For example, in the case of
the &ldquo;Browser/FTP&rdquo; RPM group, my code would generate the following
HREF link:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;A HREF="rpmlist.html#Browser/FTP"&gt;Browser/FTP&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>


The main document (<b  >mdoc</b>) has a more complex
structure. It consists of a series of HTML definition lists, one
per RPM group. Each time the group name changes, I generate the
named anchor that is the target for the reference generated above:
<pre     class="programlisting">
anchor = HTMLgen.Name(group, title)
</pre>


I append the anchor to <b  >mdoc</b> as a new group
heading:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mdoc.append(HTMLgen.Heading(2, anchor))
</pre>


For the &ldquo;Browser/FTP&rdquo; group, this would generate the following
HTML:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;H2&gt;&lt;A NAME="Browser/FTP"&gt;Browser/FTP&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;
</pre>


Once the group heading has been appended, I start a list of RPMs in
the group:
<pre     class="programlisting">
grplist = HTMLgen.DefinitionList()
</pre>


Once a new group list has been started, my <b  >for</b>
loop will keep appending RPM summaries to the
<b  >mdoc</b> until the next change in group name occurs:
<pre     class="programlisting">
grplist.append(
 (HTMLgen.Text(name),HTMLgen.Text(summary)))
</pre>


When the entire rpmlist has been processed, I generate the two
documents you see in Figure 3.
</p><p>In this example, I simultaneously generated two simple
documents and linked one to the other. This example could easily be
extended to provide further links to individual documents for each
RPM, and from each RPM to the RPMs it depends on.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a18580.0x2b09200"></a>Where To From Here</h2></div></div><p>I've only scratched the surface of what's possible with
HTMLgen and Python. I haven't covered the HTMLgen objects for HTML
Forms, Image Maps, Nested Tables, Frames, or Netscape Scripts. I
also haven't made use of Python's object-oriented nature. For
example, I could have sub-classed some of the HTMLgen objects to
customize them for specifics of each application. I haven't
discussed the Python module for CGI handling. You can read more
about these topics by pointing your browser at some of the
references accompanying the article (see Resources).</p><p>If you're trying to get started with HTMLgen, the HTMLtest.py
file distributed with HTMLgen provides some good examples. The
HTMLgen documentation is quite good, although in some cases, more
examples would help. I don't think my examples require any
particular distribution of Linux, libc or Python. All of them were
written using HTMLgen 2.0 with Python 1.4 on Caldera OpenLinux
Standard version 1.2.</p><p><a href="2986s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
