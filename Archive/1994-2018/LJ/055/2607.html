    FastCGI allows Apache to run and manage persistent CGI-like
    scripts, overcoming CGI's worst shortcomings.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf2580.0xcea3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Common Gateway Interface is nearly as
old as the web server itself. NCSA added the CGI 1.0 specification
to version 1.0 of the granddaddy of all web servers,
<span   class="bold"><b>httpd</b></span>. CGI 1.1, the current
specification, was added to the 1.2 release. Every popular web
server package developed since then has incorporated CGI as a
way&mdash;usually <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> way&mdash;for web-borne visitors
to access server-based executables.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf2580.0xcea558"></a>CGI vs. FastCGI</h2></div></div><p>CGI works well with small or infrequently used programs in
which their sole function is to respond to one-time requests, such
as processing simple information from HTML forms. There's no sense
in clogging up your memory or process table with small applications
invoked only a few times an hour.</p><p>The opposite is true, however, for complex or frequently used
programs. Your web server can slow to a crawl if your site depends
on a script with a long initialization process; in particular, one
that involves connecting to a database or reading and structuring
information from large text files. Speed issues are even more
critical for small sites with servers that also process mail, FTP
or DNS requests.</p><p>CGI applications must be launched anew with each invocation,
a limitation that leads to two problems. First, the hardware and
operating system have to deal with the overhead of creating a
process for every CGI request. Second, CGI scripts can't handle
persistent variables or data structures; they must be rebuilt with
each invocation.</p><p>Open Market's FastCGI interface is one way to overcome CGI's
limitations. FastCGI applications are invoked via URLs just like
their CGI counterparts. The difference is that they're persistent;
they function like servers within a server. FastCGI offers benefits
in three areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Speed</b></span>: a FastCGI
script goes through only one process-creation cycle. Initialization
of data and database connections are done only once. A further
benefit of FastCGI is that it can connect to processes running on
remote machines, taking the processing burden off the main
server.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Persistence</b></span>: even
if you don't have access to an SQL server, FastCGI enables many
database-like functions by storing your complex methods, objects
and variables in RAM. Data can be stored across sessions, providing
a workaround for the statelessness of HTTP connections.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Process
management</b></span>: Apache's implementation of FastCGI gives the
server daemon the ability to take care of FastCGI applications,
automatically restarting them should they die off. Other servers
may share this ability; my experience is limited to Apache.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf2580.0xceaad8"></a>Other CGI Alternatives</h2></div></div><p>FastCGI is not the first&mdash;nor, I'm sure, will it be the
last&mdash;approach to move beyond CGI. Most web servers have APIs that
allow developers to write new functions right into the server. Doug
MacEachern's <span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> module
allows the Perl runtime library to be compiled directly into
Apache, giving hackers the ability to write server modules entirely
in Perl.</p><p>I prefer FastCGI to its alternatives for four reasons:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>It's not language-specific.
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span> and proprietary APIs all
dictate that the developer use a certain programming language.
FastCGI applications can currently be written in Perl, C/C++, Java
or Python, and the standard is flexible enough that other languages
could be added in the future.</p></li><li><p>It's not server-specific. Actually, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>implementations</em></span> of FastCGI are
server-specific, but the standard is not tied to one software
package. FastCGI is currently supported on Apache, Roxen,
Stronghold, and Zeus; a commercial variation is available for
Netscape and Microsoft servers from Fast Engines,
http://www.fastserv.com/.</p></li><li><p>FastCGI applications don't run in the server's name
space. If a FastCGI application dies, it doesn't take the server
down with it. Also, since FastCGI scripts run as separate
processes, they don't increase the size of the server
executable.</p></li><li><p>It's scalable. FastCGI scripts can be configured to
run remotely via a TCP/IP connection, providing a method for load
sharing.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf2580.0xceb058"></a>Software Requirements</h2></div></div><p>My server platform is a fairly standard Linux box: a 120MHz
Pentium with 64MB RAM running the 2.0.27 kernel. If you already get
decent performance from your hardware, you won't have any trouble
with FastCGI.</p><p>As to software, I use Apache and Perl; the material below is
unabashedly biased in their favor. If you want to do your coding in
C/C++, tcl, Java or Python, or if you want to use different server
software, I suggest you visit http://fastcgi.idle.com/ for further
information. On the other hand, most of the coding hints I'll be
providing are applicable to any language.</p><p>To use Perl and Apache, you'll need to do some recompiling.
Apache needs to be rebuilt with the FastCGI module. You'll also
have to compile a Perl module. A few months ago you would have
needed to rebuild Perl&mdash;I'll provide instructions in case you need
or want to do so&mdash;but now can probably get by on your current Perl
build. Even if you're not an accomplished C programmer, however,
the compilation process is fairly painless. Here's what you'll
need:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A C compiler of recent vintage: I've used
<span   class="bold"><b>gcc</b></span> 2.7.2.1 without any
problems.</p></li><li><p>The Apache source code: I use Apache 1.3.0 (1.3.1
is the current revision). Apache comes with most Linux
distributions, or you can download it from
http://www.apache.org/.</p></li><li><p>The Perl 5.004 or 5.005 source code: I strongly
recommend that you upgrade if you're using an older version. If
nothing else, it's a good opportunity to take a peek at the new and
improved Perl home page at http://www.perl.com/.</p></li><li><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>mod_fastcgi</b></span>
source code: The current version (as of September 3, 1998) is
2.0.17. It's compatible with Apache 1.3.1 and is available at
http://fastcgi.idle.com/fastcgi.tar.gz.</p></li><li><p>Documentation and sample scripts: These are
available with the The FastCGI Developer's Kit, links to which are
provided at http://fastcgi.idle.com/.</p></li><li><p>Sven Verdoolaege's FCGI.pm
(http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/FCGI/) handles the
Perl-to-FastCGI interaction; this is the module on which my
examples are based. Alternatively, you can use Leonard Stein's
CGI::Fast module included in the standard Perl distribution (in
which case you'll need to tweak my example code a bit).</p></li><li><p>You may need AT&amp;T's freely distributed
Safe/Fast I/O (<span   class="bold"><b>sfio</b></span>) libraries,
available from http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/sfio/. Until
last June, Perl needed to be rebuilt with sfio to be able to handle
FastCGI I/O streams. The new versions of FCGI.pm work without sfio
(at least I've had no trouble), but some posts to the
fastcgi-developers mailing list suggest that there may still be a
few kinks in the new module. My recommendation is that you try
FastCGI on a stock Perl build before resorting to building it with
sfio.</p></li></ul></div><p>Once you've gathered the necessary source code, you'll be
ready to spend some quality <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>
time. Compilation is done in two segments: Perl and Apache. Either
can be done first, but within each segment the steps have to be
completed in a certain order.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf2580.0xceb8f0"></a>Compiling Perl with sfio</h2></div></div><p>Unless you know you need to recompile the Perl binary, you
can skip down to the &ldquo;Compiling FCGI.pm&rdquo; section. If, however,
you do need to recompile Perl, it's helpful to know a few
things.</p><p>To begin the Perl compilation process, unpack and build sfio;
the README will tell how. You'll also have to update your
<b  >$PATH</b> to include one of the newly created
subdirectories; this is somewhat unusual, but required.</p><p>Second, build, test and install Perl. It can take awhile to
work through Larry Wall's Configure script, but there are a few
items for which you should not choose the default answer:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>To the question &ldquo;Directories to use for library
searches&rdquo;, answer <b  >$*
<i><tt>$sfio</tt></i>/lib</b> (where $sfio is the
directory in which you unpacked
<span   class="bold"><b>sfio</b></span>). The default answer to the
next question, &ldquo;Any additional libraries?&rdquo;, should now include
<b  >-lsfio</b>.</p></li><li><p>To the question &ldquo;Any additional cc flags?&rdquo;,
answer <b  >$*&nbsp;-I$sfio/include</b>.</p></li><li><p>To the question &ldquo;Any additional
<b  >ld</b> flags (<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> including
libraries)?&rdquo;, answer <b  >$* -L$sfio/lib</b>.</p></li><li><p>To the question &ldquo;Use the experimental PerlIO
abstraction layer?&rdquo; answer yes.</p></li><li><p>To the question &ldquo;perl5 can use the sfio library,
but it is experimental. You seem to have sfio available, do you
want to try using it?&rdquo;, answer yes.</p></li></ol></div><p>I've never had trouble re-compiling Perl in this way, but the
fastcgi-developers mailing list archive (available from
http://www.findmail.com/list/fastcgi-developers/) has plenty of
messages from people who have. A fairly complete set of directions
for recompiling Perl with <span   class="bold"><b>sfio</b></span> can
be found at http://fastcgi.idle.com/fcgi2.0b2.1/doc/fcgi-perl.htm.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf2580.0x10e4488"></a>Compiling FCGI.pm</h2></div></div><p>Regardless of whether you had to recompile Perl, you'll need
to unpack, build, test and install FCGI.pm according to the
instructions provided with the source code. You can be fairly sure
you're on the right track if FCGI.pm passes <b  >make
test</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf2580.0x10e45e8"></a>Compiling Apache</h2></div></div><p>Before dealing with the Apache distribution, unpack the
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_fastcgi</b></span> source code. Read the
INSTALL file, which details the two ways to configure, compile, and
install Apache. The first, the Apache Autoconf-style Interface
(APACI), is new to version 1.3. The second is the tried-and-true
manual configuration we all know and love. Then unpack Apache's
source code and configure it for the FastCGI interface:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Copy or move the mod_fastcgi distribution directory
to &lt;apache_dir&gt;/src/modules/fastcgi.</p></li><li><p>Configure Apache using either APACI or the manual
method as detailed in the mod_fastcgi INSTALL file. I'm pretty
accustomed to dealing with the Configuration file, so I usually do
it the old way.</p></li><li><p>If you're using Apache 1.2.x or 1.3.x and you're
not running out of RAM, try uncommenting the line containing
<span   class="bold"><b>mod_rewrite</b></span>. This is a tremendous
extension to Apache that allows it to parse incoming URLs as
regular expressions. See the sidebar,
<a href="2607s1.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Health and Beauty the Rewrite
Way&rdquo;</a>, for my line of reasoning in this regard.</p></li><li><p>Run <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span>.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf2580.0x10e4b68"></a>Configuring Apache</h2></div></div><p>Apache gets all of its runtime directives from three files
found in $apache/conf: access.conf, httpd.conf and srm.conf.
Following the suggestion given by Ben and Peter Laurie in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Apache: the Definitive Guide</em></span>, I put all
directives in httpd.conf and don't use the other two files. If you
use all three files, the configuration changes will occur in
srm.conf.</p><p>Before doing any configuration, you'll need to read the
documentation included with the mod_fastcgi source code. The
docs/mod_fastcgi.html document is somewhat dated, but still very
useful for getting you started. No author is listed, but I'd gladly
buy him or her a beer for putting together a truly excellent
resource, and thereby making my job much simpler.</p><p>Let me also say that you should have more than a passing
familiarity with httpd.conf before altering it. Take a good look at
the documentation that comes with the source code or buy yourself a
copy of the Lauries' book.</p><p>The FastCGI configuration directives (see sidebar
<a href="2607s2.html" target="_self">&ldquo;Configuring Apache for
FastCGI&rdquo;</a>) allow you to accomplish two essential
tasks.</p><p>First, define the local pathway to the FastCGI applications
using the <span   class="bold"><b>AppClass</b></span> directive
and/or the remote connection host and port number via
<span   class="bold"><b>ExternalAppClass</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>AppClass</b></span> is responsible for
starting and managing processes that run locally.</p><p>Second, associate your FastCGI applications with the proper
handler or MIME type so that dealings with these files are handled
by mod_fastcgi. Associate the handler &ldquo;fastcgi-script&rdquo; with a
file or files based on location (<b  >SetHandler</b>) or
file extension (<b  >AddHandler</b>). Alternately, you
can associate the MIME type</p><pre     class="programlisting">
application/x-httpd-fcgi
</pre><p>with a file or files based on location
(<span   class="bold"><b>ForceType</b></span>) or file extension
(<span   class="bold"><b>AddType</b></span>).
</p><p>Note that your FastCGI applications cannot go into the normal
CGI directory specified by <b  >ScriptAlias</b>. Apache's
way of assigning priorities leads it to attempt to handle any and
all files in the CGI directory with the standard CGI module, which
won't work with FastCGI applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf2580.0x10e52a0"></a>Writing Scripts</h2></div></div><p>In many ways, writing FastCGI scripts is not very different
from traditional CGI programming. You must specify a
<b  >Content-type</b> (typically, &ldquo;text/html&rdquo;) if
you're providing content. You can use <b  >Location</b>
and <b  >Status</b> to specify redirects or other HTTP
messages. Also, you have normal access to the
<b  >%ENV</b> hash.</p><p>From within scripts, STDIN and STDOUT can be accessed, but
only in standard ways. The FastCGI library manipulates those data
streams quite heavily; you can <b  >print</b> without
trouble, but more advanced operations will fail. You can't, for
example, send a reference to a typeglob (a symbol table entry) of
STDOUT (<b  >\*STDOUT</b>) to a forked process. In fact,
FastCGI is fairly scornful of forking, and I haven't heard any
reports at all from someone trying to run it on a thread-enabled
version of Perl 5.005.</p><p>The main difference, structurally speaking, between CGI and
FastCGI scripts is that the main body of code is placed within a
<span   class="bold"><b>while</b></span> loop, one which hopefully
never ends. The basic structure of a FastCGI script is pretty much
the same regardless of its task:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Initialize variables and connections to databases,
daemons, etc.</p></li><li><p>Do the loop.</p></li><li><p>Provide for cleanup so you can exit gracefully when
needed.</p></li></ol></div><p>Although FastCGI will force few substantive changes in your
code, it will likely change your perspective on what makes a good
script. Some of the lessons I've learned while developing FastCGI
applications are:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Think clean</b></span>.
Typical CGI scripts don't need to be excessively concerned with
memory leaks or sloppy variable scoping. FastCGI scripts, since
they're persistent, have to keep a tighter rein on things.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Think big</b></span>. We're
used to thinking of CGI scripts as fast one-timers that should
define the fewest functions necessary to get the job done. With
FastCGI, it's usually better to have lots of functionality in one
script; you have easier access to shared data and fewer PIDs
littering your process table. I try to use the main script (the one
specified in httpd.conf) as a distribution center, jobbing out all
the real work to modules. Doing so makes it easy to extend the main
script's functionality with just an extra line or two of code; all
your tweaking can be done on the module.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Think long-term</b></span>.
You want your process to keep running, so it's wise to not let your
script <span   class="bold"><b>die()</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>croak()</b></span>. Catch the return value of
any statement whose failure might prove fatal (such as
<span   class="bold"><b>open()</b></span>) and rely on error messages
and flow control to keep the loop running.</p></li></ul></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf2580.0x10e5df8"></a>Ad Rotation Made Easy</h2></div></div><p>Webmasters of commercial sites hate to admit it, but getting
advertisements on-line is an increasingly unavoidable fact of the
job. If you have multiple sponsors in a rotation, or if your
sponsors each have multiple ads, there's no way to hardcode the ad
into a page stored on disk. Of course, this is true for any
information likely to be presented on a rotating basis: news,
current specials or random links.</p><p>The rotate.fcg script shown in
<a href="2607l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> provides a bare-bones
approach to meeting that need. It provides a persistent array of ad
information that can be inserted wherever you choose on any
disk-based document. It also allows the ad array to be updated
without having to re-start the script (although this technique
won't work if you're running multiple instances of the
script).</p><p>Based on the Apache configuration shown in the Apache
sidebar, the URL to invoke the script is
http://www.yoursite.com/fastcgi-bin/rotate.fcg?<span   class="emphasis"><em>page</em></span>.html,
where &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>page</em></span>.html&rdquo; is the name of a document
into which you'd like to insert an ad.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>page</em></span>.html can contain one or more instances of
an HTML comment that serves as a placeholder for the ad:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!-- Ad Here --&gt;
</pre><p>Using an HTML comment in this capacity means that the
document will display correctly, even if you have no ad to put
there yet.
</p><p>The script's opening section scopes and initializes all
variables to be used for the life of the process. Three things are
worthy of note in this section. First, since we initialize
<b  >@ads</b> outside the loop, it will stay persistent
for the life of the script. Second, we need to initialize the
<b  >%ENV</b> array ourselves, lest we find it empty
later on down the line. Third, we set <b  >$|</b> to a
non-zero number, because we want to flush STDOUT every time the
script is invoked.</p><p>Right before the script enters the main loop, it initializes
the array of ads by calling the
<span   class="bold"><b>initialize</b></span> routine. This routine
reads a text file of the sort shown in
<a href="2607l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>. The data for each
sponsor are temporarily put into the <b  >%sponsor</b>
hash, formatted into HTML and <b  >push</b>ed into the
<b  >@ads</b> array. If the text file can't be opened,
the routine returns an empty array, allowing the script to run
anyway.</p><p>The main action takes place in the loop labeled
<b  >REQUEST</b>. The <b  >while</b> command is
the only place the script interacts explicitly with FCGI.pm. It's
also the only substantive difference between a FastCGI script and a
traditional one. Regardless of the language you use for FastCGI
programming, a loop like this one will be the structure in which
you frame the script's main process.</p><p>Once in the loop, the first task is to allow the webmaster to
re-initialize the ad array on the fly. In the example script, this
is accomplished by placing a request to
http://www.yoursite.com/fastcgi-bin/rotate.pl?reload. To provide a
little security, the script allows re-initialization only from the
web server. If you're running multiple instances of a script,
you'll have to accomplish this by some other means: restarting
Apache with <b  >kill -USR1</b>, reloading the data file
if its timestamp has changed, etc.</p><p>If you used a script like this to run current news headlines,
it would be easy to post new updates to your site several times
each day by adding them to the text file and re-initializing the
array.</p><p>The loop's second task is to make sure that the requested
file can be opened. If it can't, the script calls a routine (not
included in my example) that would send off a &ldquo;File Not Found&rdquo;
message. By providing its own error message, the script can recover
gracefully from a bad request without having to die off. If it is
available, the requested document is assigned to the
<b  >@doc</b> array.</p><p>Next, an ad is pulled off the front of the
<b  >@ads</b> array, assigned to <b  >$ad</b>,
then pushed to the back of the array. The script retains a copy of
the ad, even though it's been put back in the array.</p><p>Fourth, the script cycles through the document looking for
any instances of <b  >&lt;!-- Ad Here --&gt;</b>. When it
finds one, it substitutes the <b  >$ad</b> for it. If the
text file containing the ads is empty or unopenable, or if the
requested page has no place for an ad, no substitutions are
made.</p><p>Finally, the script prints the appropriate HTTP header, sends
off the document and heads back to the front of the loop to wait
for the next request.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbf2580.0xff7368"></a>Finis</h2></div></div><p>My example script doesn't tackle many of the tasks at which
FastCGI excels: persistent database connections, format translation
(e.g., SGML to HTML) or providing common HTML page headers and
footers. At the site I manage, I use FastCGI to do all these things
and more.</p><p>I've found that a FastCGI application can perform its duties,
including multiple SQL queries, and deliver a page on the fly only
slightly slower than the server can deliver static documents. On a
10Mbps LAN connection the speed difference is perceptible, but just
barely, and only if I'm looking for it. Over a 128Kbps or slower
connection, I notice no difference.</p><p>I still use CGI to perform simple, infrequently needed tasks.
A CGI script doesn't hog system resources for very long. For
complex, frequently invoked tasks, FastCGI provides a great
combination of flexibility and speed.</p><p>The two listings referred to in this article are available by
