exceptionally well-written book on the internal workings of the 2.0
kernel. It covers each aspect of the kernel in great depth and at a
very high level of detail.
</p><p>The book starts with an introduction to Linux and then ushers
the reader along to the methodology of building a kernel. The
reader is then introduced to the primitives of the kernel itself,
its data structures, algorithms and system calls. At this point the
user should have a reasonable understanding of the basics of the
kernel.</p><p>The author's discussion then migrates to memory management
within the Linux kernel. An introduction on
architecture-independent memory management begins this section.
Other covered points of interest concerning Linux memory management
are the assignment of virtual address space for the proc file
system, the methodology chosen by the kernel to do caching of block
devices, and the manner in which the Linux kernel pages.</p><p>Interprocess communication is the next topic. The reader
learns the methods by which the kernel synchronizes communication
among its various parts. A brief discussion is held concerning
communications via files, sockets and pipes.</p><p>Next, the Linux file system is introduced. The basics of a
file system are described, as well as how the kernel sees the file
system. Following that is the Linux implementation of the proc file
system, and finally an excursion into the workings of the EXT2 file
system.</p><p>An operating system wouldn't be complete without device
drivers to allow the end user to attach and use any additional
devices he may have. The book covers character devices and polling
devices in-depth, and then moves on to explain the difference
between writing polling device drivers versus interrupt-driven
device drivers. The user is then led through a tutorial on
implementing a device driver to manipulate the PC speaker.</p><p>One of the true delights of the Linux operating system is its
inherent and native network support. Unlike other non-UNIX
operating systems, Linux is quite capable of using network services
without the installation of special software. The Linux kernel
handles communication at a very low level, and the book discusses
this and the kernel's handling of network devices with a great deal
of depth. The various communication protocols, i.e., IP, TCP, UDP,
ARP, and the manner in which they are implemented are also
discussed.</p><p>In order for the Linux kernel to support a device, protocol
or even another processor, the kernel must &ldquo;know&rdquo; of these things
by including the source code required to support the items
internally. While this is not a particularly difficult thing to do,
it does however increase the size of the kernel which runs in
memory. A method by which the kernel can load only the necessary
objects needed for operation, otherwise known as modules, was
developed.</p><p>An introduction to the modules in the kernel can be obtained
from the excellent section on modules in this book. The discourse
covers items such as the types of kernel objects which can be made
into modules, and the kernel daemon, the program which runs in
memory and handles the dynamic usage of modules. Finally, there is
an elegant tutorial on the actual writing and debugging of a
module.</p><p>Given the availability and low cost of components today,
people naturally desire multiple processors in their computers.
Although disappointingly brief, a section on SMP (Symmetrical
Multi-Processing) is included in the book. While this section does
contain a good deal of information, it is comparatively sparse and
Intel-centric.</p><p>At the conclusion of the primary discussion, the book offers
four appendices which contain a wealth of information. Each system
call available to the Linux programmer is discussed in detail, as
are all of the commands related to obtaining kernel information. An
in-depth look at the proc file system and information about the
running kernel which it can provide is examined. Finally, the
reader is given a fairly good look at the boot processes and all
that is involved in starting the Linux system.</p><p>All in all, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel Internals</em></span> is a
very good book for high level, in-depth reading about the kernel.
The only drawback would be its Intel-based twist, which while
acceptable, is not exemplary of the strongest feature of Linux&mdash;its
ability to run on many hardware platforms both old and modern such
as DEC Alpha, Sun SPARCs, Macintosh and SGI.</p></div></div>
