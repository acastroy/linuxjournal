    The software company is now two subsidiaries: Caldera Thin
    Clients, Inc. and Caldera Systems, Inc.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2641580.0x27391e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Caldera, Inc. recently made a move to
focus itself better on two product areas. The intent was to create
two wholly-owned subsidiaries to address Caldera's two target
markets. What are those markets? The one we know is Linux, the
other is the Embedded OEM (original equipment manufacturer) market,
where they offer DR-DOS.
</p><p>On the DR-DOS side, the new company is named Caldera Thin
Clients, Inc. Linux folks care because this is a market in which
Caldera competes with Microsoft's Windows CE. Offering DR-DOS-based
solutions makes for more compact solutions for the developers, and
also shows that an Open Source alternative can make it in a
non-Linux market.</p><p>On the Linux side of the house, the new company is named
Caldera Systems, Inc. Ransom Love is President and CEO of this
company and Dean Taylor is Director of Marketing. Bryan Sparks, who
will remain President and CEO of Caldera, Inc. said, &ldquo;The
ever-increasing popularity of Linux-based solutions for business
encourages us to create a company solely focused on these
opportunities.&rdquo;</p><p>To me, this move makes sense. Both subsidiaries are pursuing
non-Microsoft computing solutions, but they are in different
directions. DR-DOS is being offered as an embedded solution. As it
is quite small, it can fit the needs of the low-end embedded market
which includes such devices as digital cameras.</p><p>Linux solutions, particularly those for business, which is
Caldera's focus, require a totally different approach. To be a
business success, you need to offer a complete solution. In one
market, this could be Linux configured in a particular way to act,
for example, as a router or firewall. On the more complicated end,
we could be talking web server, database and web development
software or a vertical application such as a system designed to run
a dentist's office.</p><p>The types of marketing and support for these two markets are
quite different. By splitting into two subsidiaries, it will be
much easier for Caldera to follow the needs of the markets and form
the necessary alliances to make things happen. I expect to hear
more about this in the near future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2641580.0x27394a8"></a>Linux in Kelper's Parade</h2></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3148f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>In Pacific Beach, Washington, there is an event called
Kelper's Weekend. Last year we entered the parade with my old
Mercedes and a computer attached to its roof. This year we went one
better. The theme was &ldquo;Linux Invades Pacific Beach&rdquo;. Our entry
included my electric car decorated with glitter, an alien on the
roof and even an alien driving it. The word LINUX was prominently
displayed on three sides of the car. Besides the car, we had a
motorcycle driven by a penguin and a host of SSC employees and
friends in Linux T-shirts handing out candy and toys.</p><p>Although one naysayer championed Microsoft as the car passed,
it was noted that once again that software giant was not
represented in the parade. On Monday, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Daily
World</em></span>, the only daily newspaper in the area, had a photo
of the Linux alien car and motorcycle penguin on the front page. It
was nice to see good press coverage of our operating system here in
Washington state.</p></div></div>
