    XML has been attracting a lot of attention recently. This
    article provides a five-minute overview of XML and explains
    why it matters to you.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f9580.0x1af1348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Standard General Markup Language is
about two decades old. SGML was originally designed for processing
large documentation sets, but SGML is neither a programming
language nor a text formatting language. Instead, it's a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>meta</em></span>-language that allows defining of
customized markup languages. The most famous SGML-based language
today is unquestionably HTML.
</p><p>Because SGML has been around for two decades, many companies
offer SGML tools and products and it's firmly entrenched in many
high-end document-processing applications. SGML is quite a large
language; however, understanding the basics isn't very difficult.
It does contain many rarely used features which are harder to
understand. Implementing a full SGML parser is difficult, and this
has given SGML a reputation for fearsome complexity. This
reputation isn't truly deserved, but it's been enough to scare many
people away from using it.</p><p>XML, then, is a stripped-down version of SGML that sacrifices
some power in return for easier understanding and implementation.
It's still a meta-language, but many of SGML's lesser-used features
and options have been dropped. The XML 1.0 specification is about
40 pages long, and a parser can be implemented with a few weeks of
effort.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f9580.0x1af1558"></a>A Brief Glance</h2></div></div><p>A mark-up language specified using XML looks a lot like
HTML:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE myth SYSTEM "myth.dtd"&gt;
&lt;myth&gt;
 &lt;name lang="latin"&gt;Hercules&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;name lang="greek"&gt;Herakles&lt;/name&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;Son of Zeus and Alcmena.&lt;/description&gt;
 &lt;mortal/&gt;
&lt;/myth&gt;
</pre><p>An XML document consists of a single element containing
sub-elements which can have further sub-elements inside them.
Elements are indicated by tags in the text, consisting of text
within angle brackets <b  >&lt;...&gt;</b>. Two forms of
elements are available. An element may contain content between
opening and closing tags, as in
<b  >&lt;name&gt;Hercules&lt;/name&gt;</b>, which is a
<b  >name</b> element containing the data Hercules. This
content may be text data, other XML elements or a mixture of the
two. Elements can also be empty, in which case they're represented
as a single tag ending with a slash, as in
<b  >&lt;mortal/&gt;</b>, which is an empty
<b  >stop</b> element. This is different from HTML, where
empty elements such as <b  >&lt;BR&gt;</b> or
<b  >&lt;IMG&gt;</b> aren't indicated differently from a
non-empty element such as <b  >&lt;H1&gt;</b>. Also
unlike HTML, XML element names are case-sensitive;
<b  >mortal</b> and <b  >Mortal</b> are two
different element types.
</p><p>Opening and empty tags can also contain attributes, which
specify values associated with an element. For example, text such
as
<b  >&lt;name&nbsp;lang="greek"&gt;Herakles&lt;/name&gt;</b>,
the <b  >name</b> element has a <b  >lang</b>
attribute with a value of &ldquo;greek&rdquo;. In
<b  >&lt;name&nbsp;lang="latin"&gt;Hercules&lt;/name&gt;</b>,
the attribute's value is &ldquo;latin&rdquo;. Another difference from HTML is
that quotation marks around an attribute's value are not
optional.</p><p>The rules for a given XML application are specified with a
Document Type Definition (DTD). The DTD carefully lists the allowed
element names and how elements can be nested inside each other. The
DTD also specifies the attributes which can be defined for each
element, their default values, and whether they can be omitted. For
example, to make a comparison with HTML, the <b  >LI</b>
element, representing an entry in a list, can occur only inside
certain elements which represent lists, such as
<b  >OL</b> or <b  >UL</b>.</p><p>The document-type definition is specified in the DOCTYPE
declaration; the above document uses a DTD called &ldquo;mythology&rdquo;
that I invented for this article. The &ldquo;mythology&rdquo; DTD might
contain the following declarations:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!ELEMENT myth (name+, description, mortal?)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST name lang ( latin | greek ) "latin"&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA)&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT mortal EMPTY&gt;
</pre><p>I won't go into every detail of these lines, however, lines
beginning with <b  >&lt;!ELEMENT</b> are element
declarations. They declare the element's name and what it can
contain. So, the <b  >myth</b> element must contain one
or more <b  >name</b> elements, followed by a single
<b  >description</b> element, followed by an optional
<b  >mortal</b> element. (+, * and ? have the same
meanings as in regular expressions: one or more, zero or more, and
zero or one occurrence.) The <b  >mortal</b> tag, on the
other hand, must always be empty.
</p><p>The third line declares the <b  >name</b> element
to have an attribute named <b  >lang</b>; this attribute
can have either of the two values &ldquo;latin&rdquo; or &ldquo;greek&rdquo; and
defaults to &ldquo;latin&rdquo; if it's not specified.</p><p>A validating parser can be given a DTD and a document in
order to verify that a given document is valid, i.e., it follows
all the DTD's rules. This is quite different from HTML, since web
browsers have historically had very forgiving parsers, and so
relatively few people make any effort to write valid HTML. This
looseness means that code to render HTML text is full of hacks and
special cases; hopefully, XML won't fall into the same trap of
leniency.</p><p>This article doesn't cover all of XML's features&mdash;I haven't
discussed all the possible attribute types, what entities are or
that XML uses Unicode, which enables XML processors to handle data
written in practically any alphabet. For the full details of XML's
syntax, the one definitive source is the XML 1.0 specification,
available on the Web at the World Wide Web Consortium's XML page
(see Resources). However, like all specifications, it's quite
formal and not intended to be a friendly introduction or a
tutorial. Gentler introductions are beginning to appear on the Web
and on bookstore shelves.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19f9580.0x1af2268"></a>Why Does XML Matter?</h2></div></div><p>XML will most likely become very common over the next few
years. Many new web-related data formats are being drafted as XML
DTDs; three examples are MathML for specifying mathematical
equations, RDF (Resource Description Format) for classifying and
describing information resources, and SMIL for synchronized
multimedia. There are also individual efforts to define DTDs for
all sorts of applications including genealogical data, electronic
data interchange and vector graphics; the list is growing all the
time.</p><p>XML isn't primarily a competitor to HTML. The World Wide Web
Consortium is planning to base the next generation of HTML on XML,
but HTML as it currently stands isn't going to disappear anytime
soon. Many people have already learned HTML and are happily using
it; they don't particularly want or need the ability to create new
markups. There are millions of existing HTML documents now on the
web, and converting them to XML would take a long time; many
documents may never be converted.</p><p>XML <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> going to be very significant, and
XML support will be very common. The next versions of the Mozilla
and Internet Explorer browsers will each support XML and will use
it internally in various ways. More and more new data formats are
written as XML DTDs. The argument driving this is simple laziness:
if XML is available on every platform, and if its capabilities are
suited to the task, then using XML will save time with little
effort, which is always a persuasive argument.</p><p>In addition, XML will be easily accessible to programmers.
James Clark's Expat parser (see Resources) is high-quality code and
is freely available under the terms of the Mozilla Public License.
I wouldn't be surprised to see future Linux distributions coming
with Expat as part of the base system. Interfaces to Expat for
scripting languages such as Python, Perl and Tcl are already in
development and will probably have been finished by the time you
read this. Soon, adding XML parsing to a program will be as easy as
adding <b  >from xml import parsers</b> or <b  >use
XML::Parser</b> to your code.</p></div></div>
