    This article covers the use of the Java Development Kit on a
    Linux platform. It includes a general introduction to Java,
    installing the JDK 1.1.6, compiling Java support into the
    Linux kernel, writing a simple Java program and studying an
    example.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x11143a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Although several ongoing projects have
the goal of porting Sun's Java Development Kit (JDK) to Linux, for
the purpose of this article I will look at the largest and most
stable effort. It is hosted by the Blackdown Organization, with
much of the effort coming from Randall Chapman (for JDK 1.0) and
Steve Byrne (for JDK 1.1). At the time of this writing (August
1998), JDK 1.1.6 version 3 was in beta testing. This version will
be publicly released by the time this magazine is printed. See the
Blackdown's web page at http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html
for up-to-date information on the JDK port for Linux.
</p><p>Note that I use the Caldera Open Linux 1.2 Standard
distribution of Linux, so I will discuss the JDK installation with
respect to that distribution. The JDK 1.1.6 port to Linux is quite
stable on Caldera Open Linux 1.1 and 1.2 out-of-the-box
installations. It will also work with many other distributions of
Linux.</p><p>The Blackdown Java Linux porting effort still needs
volunteers. Please feel free to contact them. In fact, I received
an e-mail message from Steve Byrne stating that the source code is
not hard to understand and many areas besides debugging need
volunteers. He also said many areas of specialization exist in the
source code, so if you are good at one thing but not another,
please don't let that stop you from volunteering.</p><p>I will review the high points of three different JDK files,
drawing on personal experience. The main source of information is
the Java Linux FAQ at the Blackdown site. The first file is
http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/docs/faq/FAQ-java-linux.html.
The two other files are the README that comes with Sun's JDK and
the README.linux that comes with the Linux port of the JDK. These
two files are found in the jdk1.1.6 directory after installing the
JDK. There is also a link to README.linux from the Java-Linux
FAQ.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x11145b0"></a>A Short Introduction to Java</h2></div></div><p>Two types of Java programs exist: applications and applets.
Applets are simply small Java programs that run within the context
of a web browser. Applications are stand-alone programs.</p><p>Both applications and applets start as Java source code
files. When a Java program is compiled, the source code is turned
into Java byte code. In general, a byte-code file is generated for
each &ldquo;class&rdquo; declared in your source-code file. These byte-code
files have the extension &ldquo;.class&rdquo;.</p><p>The byte code is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine
(JVM). Unless you have a machine that implements Java byte code in
hardware, the JVM is a program run by the operating system you are
using. This is the case under Linux.</p><p>As I stated before, the difference between applications and
applets is revealed by the way each is started. An application is
started from the command line. It is a stand-alone program. In
contrast, an applet is started by a web browser.</p><p>When an application is written, a method called
<span   class="bold"><b>main</b></span> is defined. Execution of the
application starts in main. To start an application at the command
line, type
<b  >java&nbsp;<i><tt>SomeApplication</tt></i></b>.
Please note that you do not type in the .class extension.</p><p>An applet has a method called
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span>. In addition to the applet
byte code, an HTML file exists which contains an &lt;APPLET ...&gt;
&lt;/APPLET&gt; tag pair defining the location of the byte code and
other useful information. When the applet is started from within a
web browser, init is called to start the applet. An applet can be
started from the command line with a program called
<span   class="bold"><b>appletviewer</b></span>. This program,
distributed with the JDK, takes the name of an HTML file, finds all
applet tags and runs those applets.</p><p>Both main and init can be implemented in a single Java
program. The resulting program can therefore be started by either
<b  >java&nbsp;<i><tt>SomeApplication</tt></i></b>
or with a web browser.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x1114b30"></a>Installing the JDK</h2></div></div><p>As I mentioned above, the Blackdown Organization is the
repository for the largest Java Linux effort. This site contains
distribution locations, e-mail lists and known problems with the
current JDK for Linux. Currently, the latest release of the Java
Development Kit for Linux is JDK 1.1.6 version 3.</p><p>JDK comes in two flavors: one for libc and one for glibc. For
an explanation of the differences, see the Java-Linux FAQ.
According to the README.linux file that comes with the JDK, a good
way to determine which version you need is by looking at the
libraries installed on your system. This can be done with the
following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ls -l /lib/libc.so.*
</pre><p>If the files are libc5, you should download the libc version.
If they are libc6, then you should download the glibc version.
</p><p>To download the JDK distribution, point your web browser to
http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux/mirrors.cgi. This page lists
sites that distribute the JDK. You can obtain the Linux JDK port
only from a mirror of Blackdown.</p><p>Take a look at the mirrors, and choose a download site near
you. Since Caldera uses libc5, I followed the links to
JDK-1.1.6/i386/libc/v3/. Download the file jdk1.1.6-v3-libc.tar.gz.
You can also download other files from this directory.</p><p>Choose a directory to unpack the distribution using the tar
command. I chose /usr/local/. If you choose a different directory,
use that directory in place of /usr/local/ wherever it appears in
the rest of this article. Once you've picked a directory, go to it
using <b  >cd</b>, then type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xzf jdk.1.1.6-v3-libc.tar.gz
</pre><p>The installation of JDK is complete. You should now visit
JavaSoft to download documentation. Please see
http://www.javasoft.com/docs/index.html for download and
installation instructions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x1114f50"></a>Environment Variable Settings</h2></div></div><p>To complete the setup, you should modify your PATH
environment variable to include the location of JDK wrappers. Using
your favorite editor, edit the appropriate startup file (for me,
this was .profile) and add /usr/local/jdk1.1.6/bin to your PATH.
Adding this to the beginning of your current PATH setting ensures
that this JDK is invoked.</p><p>You also need to add two new environment variables:
<b  >JAVA_HOME</b> and
<b  >CLASSPATH</b>.</p><p><b  >JAVA_HOME</b> tells JDK where its base
directory is located. Although it isn't mandatory to set this
variable since the JDK does a good job of determining this
location, it is used by other Java programs such as the Swing
Set.</p><p><b  >CLASSPATH</b> can be confusing and
frustrating, but it is possible to use it well and correctly from
the beginning. Just remember this simple analogy:
<b  >CLASSPATH</b> is for Java what PATH is for a shell
on your machine. Looking closer at the analogy, your shell executes
only those programs or scripts residing in the directory pointed to
by PATH, unless the full path of the program is specified.
<b  >CLASSPATH</b> works the same way for Java. Only
those applications and applets in the directories specified by the
<b  >CLASSPATH</b> environment variable can be run
without specifying the complete location.</p><p>I usually set <b  >CLASSPATH</b> to a simple dot.
This lets me run any application that is in my current directory. I
also create scripts that set my <b  >CLASSPATH</b> on an
&ldquo;as needed&rdquo; basis, depending on what I am doing during that
particular session.</p><p>If you use bash as your shell, these three environment
variables can be set as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PATH=/usr/local/jdk1.1.6/bin:$PATH
CLASSPATH=.
JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.1.3"
export PATH CLASSPATH JAVA_HOME
</pre><p>Note that the RPMs which come with Red Hat 4.1 and 4.2 do
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> work out of the box. I recommend erasing
the RPMs and using the JDK distribution from Blackdown. Erase the
RPMs with the commands <b  >rpm&nbsp;-e&nbsp;jdk</b> and
<b  >rpm&nbsp;-e&nbsp;kaffe</b>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x11156e0"></a>Testing the JDK Installation</h2></div></div><p>You're now ready to test the JDK. Either log in or execute
the startup file to set your new environment variables, and make
sure the new environment variables are indeed taking effect.
Executing
<b  >rlogin&nbsp;<i><tt>localhost</tt></i></b>
will do the trick.</p><p>Now, type <b  >java</b>. A message giving usage
parameters should appear. Typing <b  >javac</b> should
also work, displaying different usage parameters.</p><p>Next, use your favorite editor and type in your first Java
program; name this file HelloLinux.java.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
public class HelloLinux {
   public static void main (String args[]) {
      System.out.println("Hello Linux!");
      }
   }
</pre><p>To compile this program, type <b  >javac
HelloLinux.java</b>. The compilation process creates a single
file called HelloLinux.class. To run your Java application, enter
<b  >java HelloLinux</b>. This outputs the single line
&ldquo;Hello Linux!&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x1115b58"></a>Compiling Support for Java Byte Code into the
Kernel</h2></div></div><p>The Linux kernel is capable of detecting Java byte code and
automatically starting Java to run it. This eliminates the need to
type <b  >java</b> first. When the kernel is configured
with Java support, you need do only two things. First, change
permissions of your .class file to make it executable using the
<b  >chmod</b> command. Then, run it like any normal
script or executable program.</p><p>For example, after compiling the Java program HelloLinux,
perform the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod 755 HelloLinux.class
./HelloLinux.class
</pre><p>Note that you now have to specify the full name of the
application. This includes the .class extension.
</p><p>To set up Java support, you need the source code to the Linux
kernel. The default installation of Caldera OpenLinux installs the
kernel source code for you. Use this or download the latest and
greatest kernel source and install it.</p><p>If you haven't compiled a kernel for your Linux box before, I
recommend doing it once or twice to get a feel for it. This will
also ensure that problems unrelated to Java don't arise when you
are trying to add native Java support to the kernel.</p><p>Three steps are required to set up the kernel to
automatically run Java byte code. You can find more information
about using this feature of the kernel in Documentation/java.txt in
your kernel source tree.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>In the &ldquo;Code Maturity Option&rdquo; menu, select
&ldquo;Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers&rdquo;. The
support of Java is still somewhat new and may have problems which
not everyone is prepared to encounter.</p></li><li><p>In the &ldquo;General Setup&rdquo; menu, select &ldquo;Kernel
Support for Java Binaries&rdquo;. Mark it as either a module or a part
of the kernel.</p></li><li><p>Before compiling the kernel, edit the
fs/binfmt_java.c file and place the path to your java interpreter
in the <b  >#defines</b> located at the start of that
file. (For me, this path is /usr/local/jdk1.1.6/bin/java/.) Also,
edit the path pointing to the applet viewer. An alternate method is
to leave the paths alone in fs/binfmt_java.c and make symbolic
links to the appropriate locations.</p></li></ol></div><p>If you compiled Java support as a part of the kernel&mdash;i.e.,
it was <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a module&mdash;then there is still
another way to tell the kernel where your java wrapper lives. Log
in as root and issue the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "/path/to/java/interpreter" &gt;\
/proc/sys/kernel/java-interpreter
</pre>


Note that this command needs to be executed each time you boot the
kernel, so you should place it in the rc.local file or an
equivalent location.

applications. Change the current path to /usr/local/jdk1.1.3/demo/
and you will see the numerous directories containing examples in
this directory. Some of the examples include Tic-Tac-Toe, a
graphics test and a molecule viewer.</p><p>To run Tic-Tac-Toe, use your web browser to open the file
/usr/local/jdk1.1.6/demo/TicTacToe/example1.html.</p><p>The graphics test is located in jdk1.1.6/demo/GraphicsTest/.
It is noteworthy for having been written to be executed as both an
application and an applet.</p><p>The molecule viewer is an applet located in
jdk1.1.6/demo/MoleculeViewer/. I mention it just because it is
cool&mdash;it shows off the power of Java.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x101c580.0x110cd88"></a>The Possibilities: Real Time Linux

(http://www.visualizetech.com/), specializes in high-end
data-graphing software also known as data visualization. Our
products all derive from our core library called VantagePoint.
VantagePoint is 100% Pure Java certified. Writing our products in
Java allows us to develop the software once, then run it on any
platform for which Java has been ported. In practice, our customers
have encountered few problems with the products as a cross-platform
software package. In fact, the earliest version of VantagePoint was
developed completely on Linux. Linux still plays an important role
in our company.</p><p>VantagePoint products, as a graphing solution, view the world
as <span   class="bold"><b>data sets</b></span>. The possible
operations on a data set are
<span   class="bold"><b>graphing</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>loading</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>analyzing</b></span>. After an analysis has
been performed on a data set, it is possible to do any of these
operations again. A useful sequence of operations is opening and
loading a data set, graphing the data to get a visual
representation, analyzing the data and then graphing the result of
the analysis.</p><p>One VantagePoint product, DP Server, is a manager for any
data sets you may have. It also allows connections from applets
running in a web browser on either an Intranet or the
Internet.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2570f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
