    A brief overview of the latest SGMLtools is presented by one
    of its developers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2921580.0x2a194a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the October 1995 issue of
<i  >LJ</i>, Christian Schwarz presented a short
overview of Linuxdoc-SGML as it stood then: a complete,
out-of-the-box package that gave and still gives authors a chance
to write once and present anywhere. From flat ASCII to typeset
PostScript and hypertext HTML, it all rolls out from a single SGML
source file. Since then, lots of smaller and bigger changes have
resulted in renaming it SGML-Tools (and then SGMLtools&mdash;the hyphen
caused confusion) to indicate it wasn't just for Linux anymore.
Still, we, the SGMLtools project authors, weren't satisfied with
this, so we set out to build an even better package that is
presented here, SGMLtools 2. This article will give a brief
overview of what happened to SGML-Tools 1 that led us to rename it
SGMLtools 2; more extensive information can be found on the
SGMLtools web site (see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2921580.0x2a19608"></a>From Linuxdoc to DocBook</h2></div></div><p>A big issue that came up again and again was the fact that
the shortcomings of the Linux document type definition were
beginning to show. Document type definition (DTD) is the SGML term
for the set of rules that fixes how an SGML document that is
compliant with DTD must look. It outlines the structure of the
document from titles and subtitles to tables; everything is
defined.</p><p>Maintaining a document type definition, as we found out, is
quite difficult. Constant discussion took place over which features
should be allowed, how to make existing features better, whether to
stick with pure procedural markup or be a little bit pragmatic
about things. Endless rounds of talks came up and came back and
began to interfere with progress. The Linuxdoc DTD was clearly too
limited, but we didn't want to redesign it without finding out
whether alternatives already existed.</p><p>We quickly came to the conclusion that the DocBook DTD, as
developed by the Davenport Group, would be a good successor to the
Linuxdoc DTD. DocBook, being developed by professionals for
professionals with an emphasis towards technical documentation,
fits the target audience for SGMLtools very well and solves a
number of the problems of Linuxdoc. Furthermore, almost every SGML
vendor supports DocBook, so this would make users less dependent on
us and give them more ways to process SGML documentation. Recently,
responsibility for maintaining DocBook has been transferred to the
Organisation for the Advancement of Structured Information
Standards (http://www.oasis-open.org/), ensuring that DocBook will
continue to be widely supported.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2921580.0x2a197c0"></a>From Mapping Files to DSSSL</h2></div></div><p>The acronym DSSSL may not say much to the average reader, but
it stands for another significant change in SGMLtools. DSSSL
(Document Style and Semantics Specification Language) is a language
used to specify how SGML documents will look. It helps in
translating procedural markup such as &ldquo;section&rdquo; to a certain
formatting style like &ldquo;Helvetica Bold, 18 points&rdquo;, building up
tables of contents and more. It is much more powerful than the
mapping files used previously, because it can act on context and
allows you to define functions. As DSSSL is based on Scheme, you
can do just about anything you wish.</p><p>We chose to use DSSSL not only because of its power, but also
because it is an industry standard (contrary to the old method and
to alternatives we evaluated). Also, it helped us jump-start the
project because a complete set of DSSSL styles for the DocBook DTD
is available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2921580.0x2a19920"></a>So, How Does SGMLtools Work?</h2></div></div><p>SGMLtools 2 is a collection of tools based around three core
elements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>the DocBook DTD</p></li><li><p>the standard DocBook DSSSL files</p></li><li><p>Jade, the SGML/DSSSL parser</p></li></ul></div><p>When you hand your SGML source to SGMLtools (with the command
<span   class="bold"><b>sgmltools</b></span>), it basically does
nothing but call Jade with the name of the SGML file, the name of
the DSSSL file to apply to it and the requested output format. The
following sections go into some detail in order to make the process
clear. It is not difficult to understand, and it helps a great deal
when you want to make modifications to have some basic knowledge of
what happens during a run of SGMLtools.
</p><p>Jade first reads the SGML file and tries to find the document
type definition from the SGML file's declaration at the beginning
of the file. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//Davenport//DTD DocBook
V3.0//EN"&gt;
</pre><p>appears at the beginning of a DocBook-compliant document.
(Note that <b  >article</b> can refer to any part of the
DocBook DTD, and <b  >para</b> can be used to designate a
single-paragraph document.) From the <b  >PUBLIC</b>
identifier, Jade obtains the file name of the DTD definition (see
the sidebar on Public and System Identifiers), and if all this
succeeds, the SGML source is checked for compliance.
</p><p>After the document has been found to be okay (&ldquo;validated&rdquo;),
Jade reads the indicated DSSSL file and executes it against the
parsed SGML file. The DSSSL &ldquo;program&rdquo; reads the SGML document
from objects in memory and outputs another memory structure called
a <b  >Flow Object Tree</b> (FOT). The FOT will look
structurally like the SGML document, but it contains information on
fonts, sizes, and other options. Finally, Jade hands the FOT to one
of its backends which converts the generic-style information into
the backend's specific file format.</p><p>As a short example to illustrate this process, start with an
SGML document with the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;Sect1&gt;&lt;Title&gt;Introduction&lt;/Title&gt;
...
</pre><p>This is a top-level section with &ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; as the
title. Jade determines it is a valid DocBook document by reading a
DSSSL file, perhaps <b  >ldp.dsl</b> which gives
instructions for Linux Documentation Project style formatting.
</p><p>The following section could be in the DSSSL file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(element SECT1 TITLE ((make paragraph
   font-family-name: "Times New Roman"
         font-weight: 'bold
         font-size: 20pt))
</pre><p>This expression says &ldquo;for TITLE elements within SECT1
elements, output a paragraph with a 20pt bold Times font&rdquo;. Taking
some shortcuts, we can say that this expression results in a flow
object with the given properties and the text &ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; for
content (the concept of making a paragraph out of everything, even
headings, will be familiar to people who have worked with DTP
[distributed transaction processing] software). When everything is
done, Jade hands all the flow objects to the backend, for example,
TeX. This backend, upon encountering the flow object for our
introductory section title, will output something like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
{\setfontfam{Times-Roman-Bold}\setfontsize{20pt}Introduction}
</pre>


which can then be processed by TeX and a special TeX package to
generate DVI and PostScript.
</p><p>Note that the beauty of DSSSL is that you talk only about
style, not about specific instructions for specific formats.
Whether TeX, RTF or groff, you'll always get at least a close
equivalent of a &ldquo;20pt Times New Roman Bold&rdquo; section header. If
you need to tune this, you can easily override pieces of DSSSL
specifications for specific backends. Often, you'll at least have
different DSSSL files for hardcopy and HTML output.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2921580.0x2a1a318"></a>Customization</h2></div></div><p>One of the biggest advantages of the new version is that it
is very easy to customize&mdash;once you get the hang of DSSSL. As the
previous part showed, you don't even need to know a lot about the
backend. In DSSSL, you deal with fairly high-level stuff like font
names without worrying about how these font names are dealt with in
PostScript or groff documents.</p><p>The original DocBook DSSSL style sheets supplied by SGMLtools
are meant to be customized. All you need to do is write your own
style sheet that includes the original one and overrides what you
want to customize, often just a few lines to tune parameters. In
SGMLtools you'll find a few examples of these customizations. After
you set up your own DSSSL style sheet, you must make sure SGMLtools
uses it. Do this by giving the <b  >-d</b> or
<b  >--dsssl-spec</b> option pointing to your DSSSL style
sheet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2921580.0x2a1a528"></a>Migrating from Linuxdoc</h2></div></div><p>The first question of many Linuxdoc users is, &ldquo;what about my
current documents?&rdquo; The answer is, you'll have to migrate from
Linuxdoc to DocBook within six months from the release date of
SGMLtools 2. The package provides a tool to help you in the
conversion process.</p><p>The first step in the migration process is to make sure your
documents are compliant with the latest SGML-Tools 1 version, which
will be 1.0.7 or newer. Install this software and run your
documents through it to make sure they're up to date.</p><p>The second step is to convert your documents with the command
<b  >sgmltools --backend=ld2db</b>, which spits out
DocBook documents. If this run succeeds, you can finalize the
migration by reading up on DocBook and seeing whether you are
satisfied with the result of the conversion. From this point on,
you can continue to write in DocBook.</p><p>In order to give you some space for planning your conversion,
we'll continue to support SGML-Tools 1 for six months after the
release date of SGMLtools 2 (which is unknown now, but should occur
fairly close to the publication date of this article&mdash;check the web
site for details). After six months, SGML-Tools 1 will be removed
from the web sites and as far as we are concerned, the Linuxdoc DTD
will be history. We'll remind you in comp.os.linux.announce well in
advance of this event, and of course, you're free to keep using
SGML-Tools 1 for as long as you wish, but we recommend you take the
trouble to learn DocBook and start using SGMLtools 2&mdash;it'll give
you even more flexible formatting power.</p><p><a href="2966s1.html" target="_self">Public and System
