    A report on a series of panels held at the end of O'Reilly's
    Perl Conference.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a6580.0x279e240"></a></h2></div></div><p>I have just returned from the Open Source
Developer Day, August 21, held by O'Reilly &amp; Associates at the
end of their Perl Conference. The stated purpose of this conference
was &ldquo;How to Set Up an Open Source Business in the Real World&rdquo;. It
had a few hundred attendees. This column is as much an editorial
describing my opinions of how Open Source businesses should be run
as it is a blow-by-blow description of the OSDD event.
</p><p>OSDD was an interesting event for me. Since the day's
schedule was set up with people explaining how to run a business
using the Open Source model, I originally thought it would be an
open forum rather than a series of talks. I was wrong. I also
expected the audience to be mostly business people. I was wrong
again. About 95% of the attendees were already using Linux and very
few had on suits.</p><p>I am glad I went, as I learned things. However, that learning
came from individual conversations and watching the ambiance rather
than from actual talk content. Others, with whom I spoke, seemed to
feel the same way.</p><p>I think Tim O'Reilly had a good idea but the wrong audience.
The speakers were talking to the converted. We don't need to tell
Linux believers that Open Source software like BIND, Sendmail and
Apache virtually run the Internet, as Tim O'Reilly did. We don't
need to tell this audience that &ldquo;Open Source software creates the
broadest, most robust software platforms&rdquo; as Michael Tiemann of
Cygnus did, or even that Open Source software creates a culture of
open discussion as John Osterhout did. We needed an unconvinced
audience who would benefit by hearing all these things along with
Bob Young's (Red Hat) &ldquo;talk about benefits, not features&rdquo; and
James Barry's (IBM) is it a problem or an opportunity story. Good
try, Tim&mdash;next year, maybe we can get you the right
audience.</p><p>I wish all software was Open Source. It has the immediate
advantage of allowing you to choose your own support rather than
having to depend on the software vendor. This protects you if a
vendor vanishes from the market, and it also forces the vendor into
a position of providing good support or losing business to another
vendor.</p><p>We have seen the most popular Linux distribution change from
Yggdrasil to Slackware to Red Hat. This was certainly less painful
than the transition of software from IBM to Microsoft. It has also
meant that other distributions such as Caldera and S.u.S.E. can
stay in the market, and even gives them the chance to become the
new market leader.</p><p>That said, I don't want to go to IBM or Oracle or any other
huge company and say &ldquo;Open Source is the answer.&rdquo; I believe it
is, but we don't have the ammunition to make that statement today.
Besides, we can't afford to be exclusive. If we were, we wouldn't
have Informix SE, Applixware, StarOffice or many other software
applications in our camp today. Yes, I would like to see these
companies go to Open Source, but I would rather see them do it on
their own schedule and because of market conditions rather than
from being sold on the concept by fast talking.</p><p>At a business models panel, IBM talked about its open
involvement in Apache, and John Osterhout talked about Tcl and his
company Scriptics, which will keep the Tcl core free but charge for
various enhancements. After they finished, we again experienced how
closed Open can be. Richard Stallman went to the audience
microphone and embraced IBM's involvement in Apache and called
Osterhout's company a parasite. Why bother? As Tim O'Reilly said in
an effort to terminate this speech, the market will determine who
is right.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a6580.0x279e5b0"></a>Monopolies</h2></div></div><p>Open Source should help prevent monopolies. I say
<span   class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> because I see a potential problem. When
Eid Eid was Chief Technical Officer for Corel Corporation, he told
me that as soon as Corel purchased WordPerfect, Microsoft stopped
releasing information to them about operating system internals and
future plans/changes. Microsoft did this because Corel had become a
competitor.</p><p>While Open Source might have helped, it still wouldn't
prevent a distribution vendor from adding a feature they shared
with their partners but not with other vendors. Once the
distribution was released, everyone else could get the information,
but they would have to play catch-up.</p><p>Contracts where only one company (generally a distribution
vendor) can sell an application fragment the Linux market. If a
certain application runs only on distribution A and another
application runs only on distribution B, then the user is forced to
choose between the two applications. We should demand compatibility
between Linux distributions in order for the Linux market to expand
and not become a monopoly.</p><p>One other potential monopoly scenario is the act of buying
out the competition. Look at Microsoft's history to see examples of
how this works. Microsoft bought the right to ship a product from
another vendor (the C compiler from Lattice) until their homegrown
product was ready to sell, invested in a competitor (SCO) just in
case, bought a big chunk of a new technology (Web TV), and ported
their applications to another operating system (Macintosh OS for
now; expect Linux in the future).</p><p>While Open Source doesn't eliminate monopolies, it certainly
makes them harder to create.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a6580.0x279e870"></a>Linux Standards</h2></div></div><p>Over the past few months, three different attempts at a Linux
standard have been made. The good news is that Dan Quinlan of Linux
Filesystem Standard fame has taken over as chair of what is now a
combination of the first two standards attempts.</p><p>This effort has support from a reasonable cross section of
the Linux community and, with Dan at the helm, I expect support to
grow. You can read more about it at
http://www.linuxbase.org/.</p><p>For my two cents, to make the effort work there has to be a
high level of involvement from the application vendors in order to
ensure that applications will run on all major Linux distributions.
I think a face-to-face meeting of all participants is needed to get
this effort rolling.</p></div></div>
