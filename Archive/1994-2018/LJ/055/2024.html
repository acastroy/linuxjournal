    How to add a powerful graphical user interface to Perl
    scripts
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4a3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>As you have seen in various recent issues
of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, the Xforms library allows
you to add a powerful GUI to your C or C++ programs using a simple,
intuitive API. The functionality and elegance of Xforms GUI is
comparable to Motif's, yet the Xforms libraries are free if used
non-commercially. Thanks to Martin Bartlett
(martin@nitram.demon.co.uk), the Xforms' GUI can be used from Perl
scripts to run complicated graphical applications or to provide a
simple &ldquo;please wait while loading&rdquo; status bar so the user doesn't
get bored waiting (see Figure 1). This article will discuss how to
install Xforms4Perl (version 0.5) and how to write a simple address
book program with it.
</p><p><a href="2024f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Status Bar</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4a660"></a>Installing Xforms4Perl</h2></div></div><p>In order to install Xforms4Perl, first you must have
installed the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Perl version 5.003 (or higher), compiled to load
libraries dynamically.</p></li><li><p>XForms Library, version 0.86 or 0.88, which can be
found at http://bragg.phys.uwm.edu/xforms.</p></li></ul></div><p>Next you need to obtain the source code for Xforms4Perl,
which you can do from either the author's primary site,
ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/perl/perl/, or any of the CPAN mirror
sites under the directory /authors/Martin_Bartlett/. You can also
get an RPM from ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib or CPAN, and skip
the next few sections.
</p><p>Once you have Xforms4Perl downloaded, unpack it into a
convenient directory (i.e., /usr/local/src) using
<b  >tar&nbsp;zxvf&nbsp;Xforms4Perl-0.8.4tgz</b>. This
command creates the subdirectory Xforms4Perl-0.8.4.</p><p>Xforms allows for the support of OpenGL, and if you want to
access it from Xforms4Perl, or if you need to modify some default
paths or library locations, you will need to edit the Makefile.PL
files located in the subdirectories X11/XEvent, X11/XFontStruct and
X11/Xforms.</p><p>Then enter the X11 subdirectory and do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Type <b  >perl Makefile.PL</b>.</p></li><li><p>Type <b  >make</b>.</p></li><li><p>Type <b  >make install</b> (as
root).</p></li><li><p>Copy <span   class="bold"><b>fd2Perl</b></span> to a
directory that is in your PATH.</p></li></ul></div><p>Once installation is complete, you can then start writing
Perl code which uses Xforms. You might also check out some of the
demos that come with PerlXForms, such as the author's
<span   class="bold"><b>XFtool</b></span> which is similar to the
Microsoft Office Toolbar. The rest of this article assumes you have
an existing fundamental understanding of Xforms and Perl, although
both are so easy to use you can probably pick them up from looking
at a few examples.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4b000"></a>Constructing the Look of the Application</h2></div></div><p>In order to help explain how to use the Xforms4Perl Library,
I will use as an example the development of a simple phone book
application from start to finish. The best place to start is with
the <span   class="bold"><b>fdesign</b></span> application that comes
with the Xforms library. It allows you to build the components of
your application visually. Rather than trying to figure out if your
button should be 33 by 55 pixels or 30 by 50 pixels, you just draw
it how you want it, and fdesign deals with all the numbers and
details. In order to make things even easier, fdesign is able to
output Perl code (thanks to the fd2Perl script mentioned above). We
invoke fdesign as <b  >fdesign -perl</b>, and create a
new form called &ldquo;list&rdquo; (see Figure 2).</p><p><a href="2024f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2. Form
Design</b></span></a></p><p>First, we add an object called <b  >browser</b>
where the phone book name entries get indexed. Under the attributes
section, we specify that we want this to be a
<b  >HOLD_BROWSER</b>, which allows a selection from the
browser to remain highlighted after selection. Then we give it an
obvious name, such as <b  >browser</b>, and set up a
callback function. This function will be executed when some action
takes place in the browser&mdash;using callback functions is fairly
standard in programming GUIs. We randomly pick the name
<span   class="bold"><b>browser_clicked</b></span> for the callback
function.</p><p>We now add five text input fields, all with the same callback
function, named <span   class="bold"><b>data_change</b></span>. These
fields will display the personal information from the phone book
entries and are also the locations where the user can make data
modifications. These fields are labeled and given the following
names in the attributes section:</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x1d4b528"></a><p class="title"><b></b></p><table     summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p><span   class="bold"><b>Label</b></span></p></td><td><p><span   class="bold"><b>Name</b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Name</p></td><td><p>name_field</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Phone Number</p></td><td><p>phone_field</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Address</p></td><td><p>address1_field</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Address</p></td><td><p>address2_field</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>E-Mail</p></td><td><p>email_field</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Next, we add four buttons. A pull-down menu could have been
used here, but four buttons shouldn't clutter the interface and
will be easier to access than a menu. The buttons are labeled
&ldquo;Quit!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Clear&rdquo;, &ldquo;Update&rdquo; and &ldquo;Delete Entry&rdquo;. The purpose
of the Quit button should be obvious. The Clear button is used to
clear the text input fields, the Update button is used to save or
update whatever is in the text input fields, and the Delete Entry
button is used to remove the selected entry from the browser
listing. These buttons each have a callback, as listed
below.</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x2144430"></a><p class="title"><b></b></p><table     summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p><span   class="bold"><b>Label</b></span></p></td><td><p><span   class="bold"><b>Callback
Function</b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Quit!</p></td><td><p>quit</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Clear</p></td><td><p>clear_data</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Update</p></td><td><p>update_data</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Delete Entry</p></td><td><p>delete_entry</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Finally, we can add a title such as &ldquo;PhoneBook&rdquo; or anything
else to improve the appearance, which is quite simple to do using
fdesign&mdash;you just place it and you're done. I also thought it might
be nice to give some of the buttons a shadow effect, which is done
from the respective button's attributes menu.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x2144f30"></a>Going from the Picture to the Perl Code</h2></div></div><p>Now we have finished designing the application, and we can
save it as a file called pbook. This operation generates four (or
more, based on how you set it up) files. The one of interest to us
is called pbook.pl <a href="2024l1.html" target="_self">(Listing 1)</a>. If
we ever want to modify our design, the .pl file is regenerated;
thus, we should not modify this file, as any changes to it would be
lost. Rather, in our code, we need to <span   class="emphasis"><em>require</em></span>
the file to set up our form for us.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x21450e8"></a>The Essentials of the Code</h2></div></div><p>For a Perl script to use Xforms4Perl, all you have to do is
add the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use X11::Xforms;
</pre><p>to the top of your Perl script. This command dynamically
loads everything that needs to be loaded. If you want to access the
XFontStruct or XEvent structures, then you will also need to add
<b  >use X11::XFontStruct</b> or <b  >use
X11::XEvent</b>. Before doing anything involving the Xforms
library, you must call a function so that Xforms can initialize all
of its internal variables, etc. This is done by calling
<pre     class="programlisting">
fl_initialize('Phone Book');
</pre>


and giving it the title of the application you want. You set up all
the forms you need by making calls to subroutines, such as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
create_form_list();
</pre>


which have been generated by fdesign and fd2perl. Then, add
whatever initialization code you need. For example, if you make a
&ldquo;slider&rdquo; using fdesign and need to set the range of values of the
slider based on some input, you will need to call
<span   class="bold"><b>fl_set_slider_bounds</b></span> with the
proper parameters. After you have finished configuration, you're
ready to show the form to the user. To accomplish this, make the
call:
<pre     class="programlisting">
fl_show_form($list,FL_PLACE_FREE,FL_FULLBORDER,
"Phone Book");
</pre>


There are also commands to make the form disappear, so it's fairly
easy to handle multiple forms. The options you feed
<span   class="bold"><b>fl_show_form</b></span> include the specific
form you wish to display (remember we called ours &ldquo;list&rdquo;),
options for the window manager and a title. Once everything is set
up and you're ready for the user to interact with the GUI, you then
keep calling the function
<span   class="bold"><b>fl_do_forms</b></span>. Thus, the minimal
amount of code you need to display this form is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/perl
use X11::Xforms;
require "pbook.pl";
fl_initialize('Phone Book');
create_form_list();
fl_show_form($list, FL_PLACE_FREE, FL_FULLBORDER,
                                'Phone Book');
while(1) {fl_do_forms};
</pre>


The actual interaction the user has with the GUI is accomplished
via callback functions. Keep in mind this represents the bare
essentials of a basic mode of using Xforms4Perl, and there are many
other ways of using the libraries. The Xforms manual should be
consulted for more advanced methods.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c52580.0x21455b8"></a>Back to the Phone Book</h2></div></div><p>Let's look at how our phone book program is now pieced
together. A full listing can be found in
<a href="2024l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>. First, look at the
entire main routine. In addition to the above listing, we've added
the calls to two subroutines to initialize the browser before
displaying it with the
<span   class="bold"><b>fl_show_form</b></span> function.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
load_data();
update_browser()
</pre><p><a href="2024f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3. Phone
Book</b></span></a></p><p>As you can see, most of the program is handled in
subroutines. First, we load the libraries and initialize the
program. The call to
<span   class="bold"><b>create_form_list</b></span> sets up the form
we pieced together using fdesign. The call to
<span   class="bold"><b>load_data</b></span> loads the data from a
file in the user's home directory called .pbook. The format for
this file has been arbitrarily set up to contain one phone book
entry per line with the data delimited by colons. (Assume the user
would never use a colon in any entry. See Figure 3.) A sample entry
(one line) from .pbook would look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Suhad:414 555-1234:2014 S 102nd St:Milwaukee,
WI 53227:sniazi@ucsd.edu
</pre><p>Now that the data is loaded, the
<span   class="bold"><b>update_browser</b></span> call clears the
browser and adds the newly loaded names to the browser list. To
show the phone book to the user, we make the call to
<span   class="bold"><b>fl_show_form</b></span>, and then loop
through <span   class="bold"><b>fl_do_forms</b></span> to let Xforms
take over.
</p><p>The rest of the interaction with the user is handled through
callbacks, which include adding or updating entries, saving the new
entries, displaying information and quitting the application. The
complete code is shown in Listing 2, and it's fairly evident how
the callbacks work together, given Xforms' verbose function names.
For example, <span   class="bold"><b>fl_get_input</b></span> gets the
data from an input field, and
<span   class="bold"><b>fl_set_input</b></span> sets it to some
value. To get a better feeling for all the functions available, you
can print out the 200-page manual that comes with Xforms; it makes
an invaluable reference.</p><p>Although it should be fairly easy to guess what the code in
Listing 2 does, there are a few things I'd like to mention and
clarify. First of all, when the data is loaded, it is kept in a
data structure called <b  >$DATA</b> which is a pointer
to an anonymous hash containing the names of the people in the
address book. In turn, each of those names is a pointer to another
anonymous hash containing the phone number, address, etc. For
example, to access Tom's phone number, you would use
<b  >$DATA-&gt;{'Tom'}-&gt;{pnumber}</b>. Because we
chose to handle the storage and organization of data using this
method, we run into a slight problem. If we modify the name of an
entry (i.e., change Tom to Tommy), the program thinks it is dealing
with a new entry (because the hash's key is changed), and thus, two
entries are made: one based on the name Tom and one based on the
name Tommy. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to find a
solution for this problem.</p><p>Most subroutines use either the
<span   class="bold"><b>fl_set_input</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>fl_get_input</b></span> calls to manipulate
the data you see. The only complicated call is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$name=fl_get_browser_line($browser,
fl_get_browser($browser));
</pre><p>This call is used to determine the highlighted name from the
browser. For example, in Figure 2, the highlighted name is Suhad.
In order to do that, we need to give
<span   class="bold"><b>fl_get_browser</b></span> the line number in
which the entry appears. To get that number, we make a call to
<span   class="bold"><b>fl_get_browser_line</b></span> which returns
with the current highlighted line number.
</p><p>Another thing to note is that rather than having a &ldquo;save&rdquo;
button, this phone book assumes you wouldn't make a mistake. Thus,
it saves the data every time you click on either the Update button
or the Delete Entry button. A backup of the last saved file is kept
as .pbook.bak in case of a problem, but the user has to restore the
backup himself&mdash;it's not automatic.</p><p>All listings referred to in this article are available by
