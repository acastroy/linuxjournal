Inc.</p></li><li><p>E-Mail: info@estinc.com</p></li><li><p>URL: http://www.estinc.com/</p></li><li><p>Price: $99 US</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Daniel Lazenby</p></li></ul></div><p>The need for industrial-strength backup and bare-metal
recovery tools increases as Linux continues to mature and move into
the mission-critical world. Enhanced Software Technologies' (EST)
QuickStart product addresses this need.
</p><p>Total failure of the operating system hard disk might be
considered a worst-case system recovery situation. Normally, the
replacement disk lacks any operating software or system
configuration files. This situation is sometimes referred to as a
bare-metal recovery. Typically, a bare-metal system recovery begins
with laying down the operating system. Once the operating system
has been laid down, a minimal amount of system configuration is
done. Next, the backup software is loaded and configured. With
these steps accomplished, the platform can be restored to its
baseline configuration. Many hours, CDs, diskettes or tapes later,
the operating system and application software will have been
restored. QuickStart greatly simplifies this process.</p><p>With QuickStart, bare-metal recovery is reduced to a mere
three-step process and a couple of mouse clicks. Just pop in the
Data Rescue diskette, insert the QuickStart recovery tape and boot
the machine. After the machine boots, one is presented with a
simple dialog box containing a couple of buttons. Selecting the
recover button displays a &ldquo;Recover System&rdquo; dialog box. At this
point, you verify the source media and target destination. A simple
click on the &ldquo;Start Recovery&rdquo; button and you are on your way to
restoring the system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb62580.0xc5a9d0"></a>Creating Recovery Media</h2></div></div><p>Creating the QuickStart recovery media involves booting the
system from the QuickStart diskette. Next, you verify the type of
mouse and tape drive and enable compression if you wish. At this
point, you can choose to save your configuration or repeat the
configuration steps the next time the system boots from the
QuickStart diskette.</p><p>The QuickStart release I reviewed presented a five-button bar
menu once the product was configured. This menu provided the
options to back up the system, verify a backup, recover the system,
configure QuickStart, or exit and reboot the system. Selecting the
backup button displays the &ldquo;Backup System&rdquo; dialog box. Here, you
select the backup source and the destination media. Selecting the
&ldquo;Start Backup&rdquo; button on the dialog panel displays the backup
progress meter panel. The progress panel displays the lapsed and
remaining time, total kilobytes (KB) to be backed up, KB completed
and remaining, and the current transfer rate.</p><p>Upon completion of the backup, an option to verify the backup
is presented. This release of QuickStart required the backup
verification to be started manually, and I understand verification
will be started automatically with the next release.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb62580.0xc5ab88"></a>General Performance</h2></div></div><p>My backups used an ATAPI-connected Eagle Ti-4 tape drive.
Using QuickStart compression, a backup of my 3.14GB disk took less
than 50 minutes. The progress display had indicated it would take
about 50 minutes to verify the compressed backup. Non-compressed
backups took about 1.5 hours. Verification of the uncompressed
backup also took about 1.5 hours. I got more reliable verification
results on the uncompressed backups than I did on the compressed
backups. My hardware configuration seemed to prefer uncompressed
backups&mdash;I'm not sure why.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb62580.0xc5ac90"></a>Other Uses for This Product</h2></div></div><p>Besides its usefulness as an integral component of an overall
system recovery strategy, QuickStart can be used to move a system's
software from a smaller to a larger hard disk. It can also rapidly
replicate a standard software installation on multiple platforms.
(Contact EST for licensing options and pricing if you plan to do
mass system replication.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb62580.0xc5ad98"></a>Supported Operating Systems</h2></div></div><p>Release v1.2 of QuickStart can be used with several
Intel-based operating systems including Linux, UnixWare, SCO
Interactive UNIX, BSD, Windows NT, Windows 95, NetWare and OS/2. An
upcoming release of QuickStart is expected to support the Power
PC-based Macintosh OS, a couple of other flavors of UNIX and the
BeOS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb62580.0xc5aea0"></a>Supported Devices</h2></div></div><p>Devices supported by QuickStart version 1.2 include Seagate,
Exabyte and Iomega parallel port TR-1, TR-3 and 2GB tape drives.
SCSI adapters supported by QuickStart include Adaptec,
Mylex/Buslogic and NCR. The Iomega and SyQuest removable SCSI disk
drives are also supported. Floppy tape drives such as the Travan
Ditto are supported as well. Older QIC80 tape drives are not
supported by Version 1.2 of QuickStart. My Colorado Mountain
250/350 is an example of one such unsupported QIC80 tape drive. I
have heard there are plans to support parallel devices such as the
Iomega ZIPplus and SyQuest drives. Check the EST web site for an
up-to-date list of supported devices.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb62580.0xc5afa8"></a>Manuals and Support</h2></div></div><p>The 23-page user's manual is more of a pamphlet than a
manual. It is simply written and easily read. Bold titles and
headings make it easy to locate information by &ldquo;thumbing&rdquo; through
the manual. It also includes backup administrative and management
suggestions.</p><p>I learned the first source of support should be the vendor
who sold you the QuickStart product. In addition to the vendor's
support, EST maintains a web site and a support e-mail address.
E-mails to the support address received prompt and informative
responses. At the time of this writing (August), the web site's
support pages were primarily focused on the BRU product. A &ldquo;Tech
Tips&rdquo; page provided some concepts and tools relating to BRU
backups. Hopefully, the EST &ldquo;Tech Tips&rdquo; web page will grow to
include information on how the BRU and QuickStart products can be
used together to provide reliable bare-metal backup and
recovery.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb62580.0xc5b108"></a>Relationship of QuickStart to BRU</h2></div></div><p>QuickStart and BRU are comparable products. QuickStart
provides the means to make an easily restored full system backup.
BRU provides the means of making full backups and daily
incremental/differential backups. Note that a BRU backup tape
cannot be used with the QuickStart diskette. QuickStart uses a
sector-by-sector backup to make an image of the disk, and BRU does
a file-by-file backup. This difference in backup techniques means
QuickStart can read only QuickStart tapes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb62580.0xc5b210"></a>Where Can You Buy QuickStart?</h2></div></div><p>QuickStart can be purchased directly from Enhanced Software
Technologies, Inc. Additional resellers are listed on Enhanced
Software Technologies' web site.</p><p>My test system was a Pentium II-based ASUS P2L97 motherboard,
with 64MB RAM, 3.2GB Quantum Disk and an IDE-attached Eagle TR-4i
Tape Drive.</p></div></div>
