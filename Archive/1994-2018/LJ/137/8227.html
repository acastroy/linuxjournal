This year we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the
birth of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). You might think
that we would be satisfied that free software has
become so popular during that time. Indeed, many of us now can
use an operating system and software tools that
are free. But there is much work to do and many
threats to defend against&mdash;threats posed by software
patents, treacherous computing, hardware with secret
specifications and attractive but non-free software
development platforms such as Sun's Java.
</p><p>
Much of what the FSF does today is based on the
fundamental principle that freedom is the most
important goal we seek. Having good software,
as the advocates of &ldquo;open source&rdquo; say they aim for,
is not enough.
</p><p>
The FSF ethos, engendered by its founder Richard
Stallman, has been to call upon developers and users
to demand freedom. This has inspired many in our
community to achieve tremendous things, and the FSF
today is surrounded by a strong community of support.
</p><p>
The FSF receives the bulk of its funding from its
Associate Membership. You can become a member of
the FSF for an annual sum of $120 US or $60 US if you're a
student. As a member you receive an FSF membership
card, which is a credit-card-size bootable CD-ROM
distribution. You also receive an annual membership
gift, the FSF news bulletin, e-mail forwarding and
the knowledge that you help fund our core work.
</p><p>
The FSF is the home of the GNU Project, which is the
project to build a UNIX-like operating system that
is free to all its users. The creation of this GNU
operating system, commonly using the Linux kernel,
was possible thanks to the creative and ethical
hackers that we refer to as the GNU Maintainers
and GNU Developers. Today, much work continues to
develop and maintain the GNU Project and document
its constituent parts. The FSF provides the framework
and resources for this ongoing effort.
</p><p>
Beyond the GNU Project, the Free Software community
has developed a vast array of free software tools and
applications. To promote this software and make it
available to anyone for free, we maintain the FSF Free
Software Directory (see the on-line Resources). The Directory is a complete
listing of all the stable free software programs
and now contains more than 4,000 entries. The Directory
is the de facto portal for the distribution of free
software worldwide, and it was built without commercial
advertising.
</p><p>
The FSF holds the copyright on major parts of
the GNU/Linux operating system. We carefully
collect and process contributers' legal paperwork
and register our copyrights with the US Library of
Congress' Copyright Office. We hold these copyrights
so that we can take action to keep GNU/Linux free.
We undertake this work through what we
call the FSF Licensing and Compliance Lab. As
the author and guardian of the GNU General Public
License, the FSF provides detailed resources about
free software licensing and takes action when we
receive your reports of license violations. So, if
you are developing free software and need some help with
your licensing, check out our resources. If you see a
GPL violation, please read our reporting guidelines.
If you still have questions, you can contact us
at <a href="mailto:licensing@fsf.org">licensing@fsf.org</a>.
</p><p>
The FSF seeks to encourage the adoption of free
software and not exclude anyone in the process. We
encourage businesses to use and develop free
software and contribute back to the community. Many
corporations now develop free software and have
profitable business models based on it. That is
good, but it is important to remember that only
human beings can be trusted to value the ethics of
free software&mdash;we mustn't depend upon business
interests to look after us.
</p><p>
Organizing for free software is one of the major
elements of the work of FSF President Richard
Stallman. Richard travels constantly with a busy
schedule of speaking engagements in an effort to
educate and warn people of the threats of proprietary
software. Freedom has to be fought for, and one of
the major problems we face is the fact that so many
still do not perceive the threats.
</p><p>
FSF's message and insistence on freedom over the
practical is hard for some to agree with and is
controversial in an age when many believe freedoms
are for sale. Therefore, we depend heavily on those
that do get it to join us and help fund our work.
</p><p>
You also can help by working on our high-priority
projects: GNU Compiler for Java, GNU Classpath,
LinuxBIOS and GPLFlash. Or, make your voice heard
in Europe against software patents and in the US
against the extension of the reach of the Hague Treaty.
</p><p>
Happy anniversary and happy hacking to all who
got us this far!
