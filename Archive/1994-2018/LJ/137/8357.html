Can a free market in identity systems emerge from a confusing array
of vendor-specific silos? Doc sees hope from an unlikely source.

I've been delivering the closing keynote at Digital ID
World (DIDW) since October 2002, when the
show began. I've given it five times so far. From
the beginning I've had a case to make. Here it is:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
In a truly free marketplace, vendors in a category compete openly
for a customer's business, based on information the customer
supplies at his or her discretion to any or all of them.
Customer data isn't isolated in vendor silos, and customers aren't
forced to go from one silo to another and interact separately with
each vendor's customer relationship management system,
its lame marketing agendas and its locked-up data.
</p></li><li><p>
Customers won't have full power in any marketplace unless they
control their own data, including data about their relationships
with vendors, and selectively make private data available to
vendors, with explicit permissions regarding each vendor's use of
it. Drummond Reed of Cordance and Identity Commons calls this
CoRM, or company relationship management.
</p></li><li><p>
Personal identity control and CoRM are powers customers have not
experienced since the Industrial Age began and they first
became &ldquo;consumers&rdquo;. As fully empowered customers, they will blow
the CRM blinders off vendors, release a wave of entrepreneurship,
differentiation and innovation and make markets grow in all
directions. This won't be a market revolution but, rather, the dawn
of a real market&mdash;where demand and supply have equal power.
</p></li><li><p>
CoRM requires identity services that do not yet exist. Those
services also serve other purposes&mdash;SSO, or single sign-on,
authentication, security, privacy and so on. But whatever those
services may be, they share a point of origin: the individual. This
invites adjectives such as grass-roots, lightweight,
user-centric, next-generation, human origin, bottom-up and
distributed. I like the literal meaning of the word
independent. Every speech I make on this subject is a literal
declaration of customer independence.
</p></li><li><p>
Independent Identity is a human quality more than an organizational
one. Establishing and ubiquitizing Independent Identity
therefore needs to be a grass-roots movement that grows on open
standards and with support from the Open Source community. For
that reason, it only makes sense for Independent Identity to grow
from the bottom up rather than from the top down, from individuals
rather than from organizations.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Andre Durand of Ping Identity Corp., on whose advisory
board I now serve, inspired this thinking in 2001,
when he was putting the company together. I wrote
about Andre and Ping in &ldquo;Identity from the Inside
Out&rdquo;, in the May 2002 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. In it
I describe Andre's three-tier view of identity:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
At the center is tier one: that's your core identity alone. You're
in charge of it. Outside that is tier two. This is the identity
issued to you by the government, by retailers, by airlines, by
insurance companies, by credit-card companies. Every piece of
plastic in your wallet is a tier-two identity. Tier three is the
cloud of highly presumptuous identity information held by direct
marketers and others who hope you may be the one consumer in 50 who
responds to a promotional message.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
When Andre laid this out for me the first time, I knew
instantly that we could liberate markets simply by developing the means
for individuals to assert their sovereign identities. It was a moment of
revelation&mdash;like Neo had, just before he said &ldquo;It's about
choice&rdquo; to the architect of The Matrix. In fact, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Matrix</em></span>, one of my favorite
movies ever, suddenly made sense as an allegory for the false world
invented by marketing, where consumers live in blissful ignorance of
their role as batteries whose energy maintains that world.
</p><p>
By the middle of 2004, however, I had begun to lose faith.
Even Ping Identity was caught up with the
rest of the supply side in a conversation about federation.
In an interview
last year, Eric Norlin, Director of Marketing at Ping Identity, said
federation &ldquo;leaves the distributed environment as it is, but seeks to
let end users link together those pieces and still have control over
their privacy, what gets shared, and how.&rdquo; He said the Liberty Alliance
spec, for example, &ldquo;is purposefully designed to be opaque. [It] tries to
accomplish one thing...to allow one end user to link one account to
another account. But in order to protect the privacy of the end user...neither side of that account&mdash;either Company A or Company B&mdash;would
know who the end user is that is being passed between them.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I've summarized this as &ldquo;large companies having safe sex using customer
data&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Federation is a big company concern, essentially a
silo-to-silo &ldquo;solution&rdquo;&mdash;so far. Liberty Alliance
isn't the only consortium devoted to federation. The
other big one is WS-I, where WS stands for Web
services. WS-I was founded by Microsoft, IBM and
Verisign, partly in response to the Liberty Alliance,
which was founded by Sun, partly in response to
Microsoft's Passport. Anyway, the more I heard about
federation, the more depressed I became about the
prospects for Independent Identity.
</p><p>
Then, during LinuxWorld Expo in August 2004, I met Kaliya (&ldquo;Identity
Woman&rdquo;) Hamlin at a San Francisco Giants baseball game. She told me she
worked with Identity Commons, a grass-roots organization with a
market-opening plan that leveraged some standards, notably XRI and XDI,
and encouraged new ones, such as i-Names. A series of conversations with
various Identity Commons people armed me with plenty of fodder for my
keynote at DIDW in October 2004. I wrote up the story behind that keynote in
&ldquo;What's Your i-Name?&rdquo;, my column for the January 2005 issue
of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. In that piece, I made something of a bet about Independent Identity:
&ldquo;We're not going to get that from the big vendors, for the same
reason we didn't get Linux from big computer makers: big suppliers
in any category have trouble pioneering anything that's good for
everybody and not only for them.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I was wrong about that. When the conversation started
to heat up after DIDW, the Neo role was being
played by a character with the unlikely title of
&ldquo;Architect&rdquo;, working inside the most unlikely company
of all: Microsoft. Kim Cameron is his name, and his
architecture is the Identity Metasystem. Note that I
don't say &ldquo;Microsoft's Identity Metasystem&rdquo;. That's
because Kim and Microsoft are going out of their way
to be nonproprietary about it. They know they can't
force an identity system on the world. They tried
that already with Passport and failed miserably.
</p><p>
Kim came to Microsoft by way of acquisition, when Microsoft bought
Zoomit, a Toronto company specializing in the
&ldquo;metadirectory&rdquo; field. I
came to know Kim through Craig Burton of The Burton Group, back in the
early 1990s. Craig and his organization saw non-interoperable
directories as a problem that could be solved only by a system that was
intentionally inclusive and respectful toward all directories and their
countless differences. Craig labeled the required system a
metadirectory and called for vendors to fill the market's need for
one. Kim and Zoomit stepped forward and developed a metadirectory
product, along with a lot of deep thinking about directories and related
issues, including security and identity. During that time I became good
friends with Kim, an occasional consultant to Zoomit.
</p><p>
Microsoft acquired Zoomit at about the time it was becoming clear that
Passport was failing. At Microsoft Kim took a leading role in re-thinking
the company's approach to identity. It became clear to him that taking a
&ldquo;meta&rdquo; approach would open a whole new marketplace&mdash;for
Microsoft and everybody else:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
At first I didn't think it was possible. But while I
was scrounging around one day I ran across this one protocol that was so
simple I could hardly believe it. I saw how it could work like a conduit
for the simple exchange of tokens and how it could bridge many
different identity systems.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Craig Burton took a natural interest in Kim's identity work at
Microsoft. Before DIDW/2004, Craig began telling me that Kim's
architecture had the potential to seed and support&mdash;in an
open way&mdash;the kind of grass-roots movement I'm looking for.
</p><p>
So I made sure Kim got to connect with the other grass-roots advocates
attending the conference: Drummond Reed, Fen LaBalme, Mark LeMaitre,
Kaliya Hamlin, Jan Hauser and Owen Davis of Identity Commons and also,
for several on that list, of Seattle-based Cordance; Dick Hardt of
Sxip; Marc Canter, currently of Broadband Mechanics but perhaps best
known as a founder of Macromind, which later became Macromedia; Simon
Grice of MiDentity; and Phil Windley of Brigham Young University, also
the former CIO of Utah and the author of a new book from O'Reilly on
digital identity. All are open-source and open standards advocates, and
all consider open-source involvement essential to the success of
whatever it was Kim and Microsoft had in the works, which still wasn't
clear at the time.
</p><p>
An informal group began to form. Meetings followed in
Seattle and other places. And right after DIDW/2004,
Kim also began posting his Seven Laws of Identity. He
did this on an installment plan to give everybody
time to talk about each one before moving on to the
next. His First Law appeared on November 16, 2004, and his
Seventh Law appeared in March 2005. In summary form,
here they are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
User Control and Consent: digital identity systems must
reveal information identifying a user only with the user's consent.
</p></li><li><p>
Limited Disclosure for Limited Use: the solution that discloses
the least identifying information and best limits its use is
the most stable, long-term solution.
</p></li><li><p>
The Law of Fewest Parties: digital identity systems must limit disclosure of identifying
information to parties having a necessary and justifiable place in a
given identity relationship.
</p></li><li><p>
Directed Identity: a universal identity metasystem must support both
&ldquo;omnidirectional&rdquo; identifiers for use by public entities
and &ldquo;unidirectional&rdquo; identifiers for private entities,
thus facilitating discovery while preventing unnecessary release of
correlation handles.
</p></li><li><p>
Pluralism of Operators and Technologies: a universal identity metasystem
must channel and enable the interworking of multiple identity technologies
run by multiple identity providers.
</p></li><li><p>
Human Integration: a unifying identity metasystem must define the human
user as a component integrated through protected and unambiguous
human-machine communications.
</p></li><li><p>
Consistent Experience across Contexts: a unifying identity metasystem must
provide a simple consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts
through multiple operators and technologies.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The Laws serve two purposes. The first is to guide conversation and
development in an emerging marketplace. The second is to guide conversation
and development inside Microsoft. Kim says he often finds himself saying
stuff like, &ldquo;No, that would break the Fifth Law&rdquo; or &ldquo;That misses the
point of the Seventh Law.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Microsoft is and will remain an issue. In October and November 2004, Marc
Canter and others wondered out loud about how we could ever trust the
company or its partners, such as Sun Microsystems. Craig Burton
acknowledged the problem in a December 4th blog posting:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Marc contends that people don't want to get locked into standards
owned by Microsoft or Sun. Kim wants to look beyond the past and
create a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; of distributed computing that would eclipse the
petty Microsoft bashing. In Marc's defense, Microsoft is an
unabashed bully. The leaders of Microsoft&mdash;Bill Gates and Steve
Ballmer&mdash;lead the bully behavior. I have personal experience of
this behavior from both of them. Microsoft doesn't and isn't going
to play fair anytime in the future&mdash;in general.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Perspective: Craig fought Microsoft when he was at Novell in the
1980s&mdash;and usually won. One high-level Microsoft executive told me years later
that Craig was perhaps the only leader at a competing company that truly
understood how to compete and win against Microsoft. Craig continues:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I say &ldquo;in general&rdquo; for a reason. There are good people with vision
and integrity at Microsoft. Kim Cameron is one of those people. You
can't go wrong working with Kim. Further, it is just ludicrous to
think that Microsoft is of one voice and has an overarching plan
with which to rule everything always and forever....I have said
before to Kim that working at Microsoft is like working inside ten
tornadoes. I am changing that to a thousand tornadoes. Each tornado
(or hailstorm if you like) has its own path, thinking and objective.
They seldom cross paths and are too busy dealing with the issues at
hand to even talk to each other. Microsoft is a thousand tornadoes deep.
</p><p>
Microsoft bashing aside, when two people like Marc and Kim get
together and collaborate, expect good things to happen that go
beyond the history of giants&mdash;even the giant of all time&mdash;Microsoft.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The most significant push-back we received was from Dave Winer, whom Kim
considered to be an important role model. Dave had success at launching
standards, including XML-RPC, SOAP&mdash;which Dave and his company,
Userland, co-developed with Microsoft&mdash;and RSS, and he made it all
happen without the clout of a large organization behind him. RSS was an
especially interesting case, because it established a service,
syndication, that is rapidly moving toward ubiquity.
</p><p>
On his blog, Scripting News, Dave wrote:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Doc Searls...offered RSS and podcasting as examples of technologies
that were simple, therefore successful, and suggests that identity,
if it were to be approached the same way, might have similar
success. Bzzzt. Wrong. RSS was not easy, it was hard, for exactly
the same reasons identity is hard. Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Two ways to do identity is one too many.
</p><p>
Politics spoiled identity and would have spoiled RSS had the major
players not converged on RSS 2.0. The difference this time was that
there was a Switzerland, me, to guide RSS through its gauntlet, and
I clearly wasn't in bed with any of the major publishers or vendors.
The Harvard connection didn't hurt because it's a highly respected
university that hadn't been involved in tech standards. Had identity
had that kind of champion-ship it might not be the mess it is today.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I didn't think identity was spoiled in the least. But
I also realized something. Identity needs a Dave
Winer: an independent developer and free-range
technologist who tirelessly advocates something that
can work for everybody.
</p><p>
On December 30th, Steve Gillmor called. He was hunting up guests for the
&ldquo;Gillmor Gang&rdquo; scheduled the next day: New Year's Eve. I suggested
bringing in the &ldquo;Identity Gang&rdquo;&mdash;or as many as wanted to come on the
show. Steve said yes, and I sent out an e-mail to nine people, including
Dave Winer, whose experience, example and skepticism I thought were
essential. To my surprise, nearly all of them, including Dave, agreed
and took part in the show.
</p><p>
The conversation was all over the place. But it
served as a public meeting to which many could
listen and link. The &ldquo;Identity Gang&rdquo; show was
energizing. Starting on January 1, 2005, I saw
Independent Identity issues being discussed&mdash;not only in
blogs and podcasts but in trade pubs and in halls
at conferences&mdash;with considerable optimism. In the
past, discussions always seemed to go sideways into
energy-draining digressions on privacy, crypto and
other muddy subjects, such as &ldquo;Microsoft Sucks&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Kim bled off a lot of steam by publishing his Fifth Law on New Year's
Day. Craig Burton wrote this about it:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The Law of Pluralism is contrary to the laws of customer control.
</p><p>
Let's be clear: the Law of Pluralism requires operating system
independence&mdash;by definition. This means the Microsoft Identity
Architect is calling for a system that is not necessarily
Windows-centric by design. This&mdash;of course&mdash;is the only way such a
system can really work. But consider the implications.
</p><p>
A cross-platform identity metasystem is sun-spot hot and&mdash;with the
other laws being discussed here&mdash;changes everything.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The Identity Metasystem looked to each of
us&mdash;so far as we could understand it, which wasn't enough&mdash;as
though it had the makings of a Net-native system that would embrace and
accommodate everybody's separate efforts. It helped especially that
Drummond Reed and the Identity Commons people already were figuring out
ways of working with the Identity Metasystem.
</p><p>
Kim also demonstrated InfoCards, a Microsoft
identity implementation that can work within the
Metasystem. Everybody was eager to think about
or find other implementations&mdash;so nobody would
confuse the InfoCard implementation with the Identity
Metasystem architecture. At one point I asked if it
was possible for InfoCards, or anything Microsoft
was doing in the Identity Metasystem framework,
to plug in to Firefox. Kim said, &ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;
I invited Mitchell Baker to the next meeting we held,
and she and Kim agreed that it ought to be workable.
</p><p>
The Identity Gang has grown since then. DIDW gave us a room to use on
May 8th, the day before the show started. About 40 people met all day
around a large table. Kim explained the Identity Metasystem in more
detail than we had heard before. There was a lot of discussion, including
plenty of skepticism, but more than enough positive energy to keep
everybody interested.
</p><p>
Since then, Kim and his team have published a whitepaper titled
&ldquo;Microsoft's Vision for an Identity Metasystem&rdquo;. The paper outlines the
architecture in some detail. Here are the key paragraphs:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The encapsulating protocol used for claims transformation is
WS-Trust. Negotiations are conducted using WS-MetadataExchange and
WS-SecurityPolicy. These protocols enable building a
technology-neutral identity metasystem and form the
&ldquo;backplane&rdquo; of
the identity metasystem. Like other Web services protocols, they
also allow new kinds of identities and technologies to be
incorporated and utilized as they are developed and adopted by the
industry.
</p><p>
To foster the interoperability necessary for broad adoption, the
specifications for WS-* are published and are freely available, have
been or will be submitted to open standards bodies and allow
implementations to be developed royalty-free.
</p><p>
Deployments of existing identity technologies can be leveraged in
the metasystem by implementing support for the three WS-* protocols
above. Examples of technologies that could be utilized by way of the
metasystem include LDAP claims schemas; X.509, which is used in
Smartcards; Kerberos, which is used in Active Directory and some
UNIX environments; and SAML, a standard used in inter-corporate
federation scenarios.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Figure 1 shows the graphic illustration.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8357f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The WS-* Architecture
</p></div></div><p>
The Independent Identity would be one of the ID providers, part of the
metasystem. It could be hosted locally, on a Linux box in the clouds, on
a phone&mdash;wherever someone wanted to put one.
</p><p>
I've told Kim that he and Microsoft
need to do more before my constituency&mdash;the Linux and Open Source
development communities&mdash;takes a serious interest in the Identity
Metasystem. I said, &ldquo;If you don't have an open-source license or if you
start talking about IP Frameworks, my readers will leave the
room.&rdquo; The term IP Frameworks was used by somebody from another part of
Microsoft, in respect to the WS-* standards process. Kim replied:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
It's essential to have the Open Source community involved. And I
wish we were already at some point in the future when we have some
of these things cleared up. But we're talking about slow processes
here. The standards process is incredibly complicated. You get a
bunch of companies together, and the process is like nuclear
disarmament. The only way to get a royalty-free standard is to
negotiate IP in such a way that nobody can sue because it's a
standoff. What an &ldquo;IP Framework&rdquo; means to me&mdash;though I am not a
lawyer and can's speak for Microsoft on IP issues&mdash;is that
everybody puts their IP in and agrees not to charge royalties.
Ironically, the biggest concern may not be each company's IP, but
submarine patents that can surface later and screw up everybody.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
As for open-source licensing, Kim has said encouraging things to me
privately, but for now there's nothing to report. I'm hoping, for
everybody's sake, there will be an accepted open-source license or
licenses in place by the time you read this.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, everybody in the open-source camp seems to be scratching
their own itches, each in their own simplifying way.
</p><p>
Open ID says, &ldquo;This is a distributed identity system, but one that's
actually distributed and doesn't entirely crumble if one company turns
evil or goes out of business.&rdquo; Its identities are URL-based.
</p><p>
LID's goal is to &ldquo;empower individuals to keep control over and manage
their digital identities, using VCards, FOAF and GPG. It is very
REST-ful and fully decentralized. It is also a great mechanism to add
accountability to REST-based Web services, even if no (human) digital
identities are involved.&rdquo; Johannes Ernst, one of LID's creators, says
&ldquo;it's the simplest scheme there is, so simple that, just like a few
other folks have done already, you can probably implement it yourself
over the weekend and add five new profiles to it that we didn't even
think of.&rdquo; There are several LAMP and J2EE implementations available for
download.
</p><p>
Sxip is more ambitious and has several parts. Sxip.net (Sxip Network)
is &ldquo;a simple, secure and open digital identity network that offers a
user-centric and decentralized approach to identity management. This key
piece of Internet infrastructure, based on a network architecture
similar to DNS, can be used by people to develop their own identity
management solutions, enabling distinct and portable Internet
identities.&rdquo; Sxip.com (Sxip Identity) &ldquo;provides identity management
solutions that leverage the Sxip Network and drive Identity 2.0
infrastructure. Sxip empowers individuals to create and manage their
on-line digital identities and enables enterprises to instantly provision
and manage their users.&rdquo; Sxip.org provides developer resources,
including a Subversion code repository.
</p><p>
Moebius &ldquo;builds on the success of e-mail-based identity systems by adding
a few important but incremental improvements while laying the foundation
for more advanced identity systems in the future. Moebius is more
convenient to use, easier to deploy and safer for all concerned,
without requiring expensive investments in new infrastructure or
adoption of untried, centralized identity systems.&rdquo;
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Editors' Note: Moebius has changed its name to
<a href="http://www.passel.org" target="_self">Passel</a>.</em></span>
</p><p>
There are other open-source and Linux-related efforts around identity,
and I'm sure this article will flush out those who feel offended by their
exclusion. I invite them to join the Identity Gang or whatever name it
uses by the time you read this.
</p><p>
Things are moving so fast, in so many directions
at once and with so many individuals involved, that
it's impossible to cover the subject completely. This
piece sets a record of frustration for me, personally.
I've been working on it since January, and I've
rewritten it countless times. I was going through
a series of rewrites when I missed my deadline last
month. And I almost decided to make it a <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site piece several days ago, when I still wasn't
sure if Kim and his Identity Metasystem would take
the heat from interested skeptics like Julian Bond
and Dave Smith&mdash;or from those of us (a percentage that
rounds to &ldquo;everybody&rdquo;) who see a lock-in agenda behind
every Microsoft move. So I posted some tough public
questions on IT Garage. Kim has met every challenge
with grace, humor and backbone. I'm sure he needs
all three to make this project fly inside Microsoft.
</p><p>
I also want to thank Microsoft for giving Kim a way to apply his genius.
If this thing flies, high fives are due all around.
</p><p>
The best any of us can do is stay true to our own principles and
purposes. Kim's are embodied in his &ldquo;meta&rdquo; understanding of the world.
The man is the best includer I've ever known. Microsoft is lucky in the
extreme to have him working there. Mine are embodied in an NEA
understanding of the Net&mdash;as something Nobody can own, Everybody can
use and Anybody can improve.
</p><p>
There is an improvement I want to see, and it's something only
Independent Identities can produce.
I want anybody to be able to pay for anything on a voluntary basis,
because I believe the voluntary ability to pay whatever one wants is at
the heart of a free and open marketplace. I also believe we haven't
experienced that power since the Industrial Revolution put huge
suppliers in charge, even of democratic governments. We certainly
haven't had it since the invention of the price tag.
</p><p>
I'm not saying I want to turn every store into a commodities pit where
everybody haggles over prices. I'm not saying &ldquo;Let's get rid of fixed
prices.&rdquo; I am saying, let's give consumers the power to be customers. I
am saying, let's start by making this work in markets where no prices
have yet been set, where sellers and buyers don't yet have the means for
discovering what their goods are worth, where&mdash;because that mechanism
is absent&mdash;most of the goods are free, as in beer.
</p><p>
I have two markets in mind: &ldquo;podsafe&rdquo; (non-RIAA, Creative
Commons-licensed) music and podcasts. I would like to be able to express my
willingness to pay for music I like and for podcasts I like and to do
that at my discretion, quickly and easily. And, to extend that ability
to other services that welcome voluntary payment, such as public radio
and TV, churches, charities and so on.
</p><p>
I would like that capability to be built in to my browser, as a plugin
probably, and my RSS aggregator. Later, I'd like to see it in cell
phones and other mobile devices.
</p><p>
I would like the Open Source community to step into those markets with
me and say, &ldquo;We have a way that anybody can pay anybody for anything, on
their own or mutually agreeable terms.&rdquo; And free has to be an
alternative. Free still has to be okay.
</p><p>
You might say I'm talking about a more robust shareware market here. One
where suppliers don't beg or cajole, make goods scarce or call those
who get goods for free &ldquo;pirates&rdquo;. I'm talking about making the Net as
open and responsible as a farmers market: a place where customers are
as unlikely to filch from an artist's site as they are to take an
apple from a farmer's cart. And where artists of all kinds still can
give away all they like.

Can this be done? I don't know. I can think of a hundred reasons why it
can't. I'm sure the rest of you can think of more. Between me writing the last
sentence and this one, Johannes Ernst wrote this to me:

The trouble though, is, that we are miles away from being able to
understand what the technical requirements are for such a
transformational system, because we haven't thought through the
transformational applications that need to be supported.
</p><p>
Yet I feel certain there's a way of doing this, and experimenting
with it, and seeing what works and what doesn't, and showing the
world how a free and open marketplace can work.

I want to give the old choose-your-silo system a bad case of Innovator's
Dilemma. We need something disruptive here. Something simple and new. An
invention that mothers necessity.
</p><p>
We won't get it if we get bogged down in long-winded digressions about
privacy and crypto and the big awful companies that want to keep their
hands&mdash;oops, credit and membership cards&mdash;in our pockets. Those are
legitimate and necessary concerns, but they are secondary to the purpose
of establishing methods and protocols and technologies for the assertion
of Independent Identity. And for changing the world by saving markets
from the producerist mentality that has kept everybody, producers
included, in darkness for more than a century.
</p><p>
I also feel certain that forces far more nefarious than Microsoft are
hell-bent on putting the Net genie back in the telco and cableco
bottles&mdash;and turning it into the distribution system for
&ldquo;protected content&rdquo; they imagined when they made sure
the &ldquo;information superhighway&rdquo; had asymmetrical driveways
to every &ldquo;consumer's&rdquo; home.
</p><p>
If we don't want that, we have to show we're customers and not just
consumers. And real customers don't just shop in silos.
