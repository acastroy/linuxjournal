A new generation of databases creates a new set of decisions and
several full-featured ways to build queries.

The design and implementation trade-offs within a native XML database
make a significant impact on the performance, scalability and features
available to applications that use it. This article focuses on the
granularity of stored XML documents and indexing as two of the most
critical design considerations. Berkeley DB XML from Sleepycat Software
(<a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/products/xml.shtml" target="_self">www.sleepycat.com/products/xml.shtml</a>)
is the basis for this discussion.
</p><p>
The basic functions of an XML database are to
store documents, query over documents and handle query results. Of course,
indexes are required to obtain acceptable query performance.
</p><p>
In a relational database, pieces of a relational
table are stored, queries are SQL and results
are tabular. This abstraction and standardization is
useful from an application developer's perspective.
Developers have less visibility into precisely how documents are stored and
indexed and how a query can leverage the combination of storage format,
indexes and query language to answer a question quickly.
</p><p>
The same concepts exist in a native XML database, such as Berkeley DB XML. In this case, the data is
the XML document and the query may be an XPath or
XQuery expression. The results may be XML documents,
DOM, SAX or a proprietary form. Within a native XML
database, mechanisms for storage, indexing and
querying are not obvious from the perspective of an
application developer, yet they are critical to the
function, performance and scalability of the
overall system.
</p><p>
A native XML database exposes a logical model of
storing and retrieving XML documents; however, its
internal storage model may not be equivalent to the
document. Indexing is a crucial component of any
database. Without intelligent indexing, a database
is little better than a filesystem for
information retrieval. Query processing builds on
both storage format and indexes but is beyond the
scope of this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbff580.0xcf7558"></a>
Storage Formats and Granularity</h2></div></div><p>
Most native XML databases are oriented toward
storing XML documents, where a key issue is the
granularity with which the document is stored. In
database terms, granularity can be described in
several different ways: external access, internal
addressability and concurrency.
</p><p>
A distinction is made between access granularity and
addressability. Addressability refers to objects
that can be named and accessed directly, without
navigation, within the system. Access may be
provided through a DOM to a system with an addressable
granularity of an XML document, by parsing the
document. In this sense, access granularity is
user-visible, while addressability is an internal
concept. Concurrency means how objects can be modified concurrently,
if such a feature is supported.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbff580.0xcf76b8"></a>
Intact Document Storage</h2></div></div><p>
There are two major choices in terms of how to store
a document&mdash;intact or not intact.
Systems that store XML documents intact usually
parse the XML in order to ensure it is well formed
and valid but otherwise store documents unchanged.
This is useful for applications that require
retrieval of the entire byte-for-byte document or for
round tripping. Furthermore, for relatively small
documents that tend to be retrieved and processed
whole, such a system is ideal. The major issue for
intact document storage is how to address target
documents within a collection of documents. There
are two primary mechanisms to do this: a unique identifier,
such as name or document ID, or a query
expression, such as XQuery. The first results in
exactly one document, whereas the latter may return many
documents in a result set.
</p><p>
For a large collection, it must be possible to
target a small set of result documents in a query.
For intact document storage, this implies an
indexing mechanism. If a document is parsed upon
insertion into a collection, it can be indexed as
well, based on the system's indexing specifications.
Indexes in this type of system use document
granularity addressing. It is desirable to avoid
parsing documents in order to resolve a query.
Additional parsing can be avoided if the query can
be answered definitively from indexes and the access
granularity desired by the application is at the
document level, as opposed to DOM granularity access.
</p><p>
A clear disadvantage of intact document storage is
that for certain applications and queries, it can
take a long time and a large amount of memory to
process a request. This is mostly due to the need to
parse documents to satisfy a query. Optimizations, such as references to offsets within a
document, can be made, however, for read-only documents.
</p><p>
The advantages of intact document storage include
its simplicity and byte-for-byte round
tripping. Berkeley DB XML has an option to store
documents intact.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbff580.0xcf78c8"></a>
Fine Granularity Storage</h2></div></div><p>
Some native XML databases, such as Berkeley DB XML,
store documents with granularity finer than the
document. The properties of such systems include:
addressability is subdocument level, access
granularity is subdocument level and concurrency
granularity may or may not be finer
than document level.
</p><p>
Storing documents in pieces offers a number of advantages,
including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Ability to reference an element or other
object within a document directly.
</p></li><li><p>
Ability to retrieve partial documents without
parsing.
</p></li><li><p>
Efficient querying, without parsing, by
materializing only those parts of a document
necessary to evaluate the query.
</p></li><li><p>
Ability to modify a small piece of a large
document.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The decision to store documents in pieces results in
more choices:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Degree of round tripping supported, if any.
</p></li><li><p>
What information is stored or the data model of
the storage.
</p></li><li><p>
Granularity of addressability.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for partial document modification,
without rewriting the entire document.
</p></li><li><p>
Physical format of information.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Fine-grained document storage systems must choose
the degree of round tripping supported if it is a
requirement to be able to return the original
document, byte for byte. Virtually any decomposition
of a document for storage results in loss or change
of information, such as reordering of attributes, or
a change in the XML declaration. This is because
there is not a 1:1 mapping from XML infoset to bytes
in a document. That is, there are bytes within an
XML document that are not considered relevant to the
infoset and, therefore, may not even be passed
through by a parser.
</p><p>
To support round tripping, a fine-grained document
storage system must track entity references that
are expanded during parsing, as well as ignorable white space
and namespace prefix mappings. Such mechanisms are
unimportant in terms of querying and retrieval of
partial documents, but for some applications, they can be
critical for document serialization. Because the degree
of round tripping implies extra cost, some systems
export configuration options to determine handling
of these issues.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbff580.0xcf8210"></a>
Data Model</h2></div></div><p>
Intact document storage has the vastly simplifying
advantage of being unconcerned with the data model
of the XML documents it stores. Fine-grained
document storage must decide on the data model,
which is tied closely to query processing and query
language support. For example, XQuery's data model
is typed, and type information can appear in XQuery
expressions. XPath 1.0 expressions, however, are not
richly typed, so no additional type information is
necessary.
</p><p>
A simple example of the data model issue is DOM vs.
XQuery. The DOM is relatively simple. Where most
every object is a node, some nodes have names, some
have values and some have children and siblings.
The DOM essentially is a tree with little semantic
information, and virtually all of its information is
contained in the XML document itself. Conversely,
the XQuery data model is typed. XQuery does support
simple, well-formed XML; however, it also supports
type information, as obtained from a
schema-validated document, where the schema
information comes from outside the document.
</p><p>
It is possible to choose a storage data model
equivalent to the XML infoset or DOM, but then the
powerful type facilities of XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0
are not fully available. A schema-validated document
has type information available at the time it is
parsed and validated. A system where parsing,
validation and querying occur at the same time has
no problem obtaining type information to satisfy the
query. However, in a fine-grained storage system,
the parsing and query events are not related. This
means that at the time of the query, type
information must be found if it is to be used for
the query. There are several choices for how a
system can implement types:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Store type information with each document and
typed object and materialize it for querying.
</p></li><li><p>
Store references to relevant schema files and
reload (parse) them for querying.
</p></li><li><p>
Map each type to the nearest atomic type in the
XML Schema recommendation and store that
information.
</p></li><li><p>
Don't support type information at all, which
limits queries and forces them to use their
own, complex type definitions.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Granularity of addressability is tied closely to the
data model. At one extreme is the choice of DOM
objects as the addressable unit. This means that
each DOM node, be it a document, element or
attribute value, is an addressable and separately
stored object. Although simple, this approach is quite
expensive in terms of memory, disk space and CPU.
There are other, coarser-grained solutions. One is
to use the element as an addressable unit and
associate its attributes and child text nodes.
Another is to address elements and text nodes
and associate attributes with elements. The former
may be better for locality of reference, if an
element and its attributes and text nodes are likely
to be referenced together.
</p><p>
Native XML databases that store documents as
fine-grained nodes must assign addressable node
identifiers (node IDs) to addressable units. Node
IDs are used to retrieve specific nodes during
processing. When it comes to physical storage, size
matters. Smaller nodes and node IDs mean better
locality of reference and fewer disk accesses to
read and write data.
</p><p>
Berkeley DB XML stores nodes in a B-tree, where node
IDs are allocated in document order, which also is
an iteration order on the B-tree. This means that once
a node is located, serialization or child navigation
can occur by way of iteration rather than by additional
lookup operations.
</p><p>
With the appropriate sorting/comparison function, a
node ID that is a B-tree key can take on many
physical forms. It can be as simple as an integer,
or it can be a complex array or string. Node
numbering is one of the more interesting and
important design choices in a native XML database.
There are node numbering schemes that have the
ability to allow insertion and removal of arbitrary nodes
without renumbering and to allow query-relevant operations
to be performed based solely on node numbers and indexes,
eliminating node lookups.
</p><p>
Berkeley DB XML uses a numbering scheme that allows
some direct relationship comparisons and attempts to
minimize the need to materialize nodes for
navigation. The scheme also avoids renumbering when
a document is modified partially.
</p><p>
One advantage of fine-grained storage is the ability
to modify some parts of documents without touching the
rest. There is a significant performance and
scalability benefit in such &ldquo;surgical&rdquo; changes;
however, it can be difficult to do efficiently. Many
systems do not support partial modification of
documents, and if they do, it is only through a well-defined
interface such as XUpdate, as opposed to a direct DOM manipulation.
</p><p>
A partial modification can render a document
invalid, or worse, malformed. Re-parsing
for validation, however, negates much of the benefit of
partial modifications. Insertion or removal of an
addressable object, such as an element, affects the
system's node numbering scheme, as described above.
Indexes also are affected and must be updated. A
database may choose to revalidate or parse after a
modification or allow the application to
request it explicitly.
</p><p>
Fine-grained document storage has a disadvantage in
serialization of an entire document. In this
situation, an iterator must traverse the addressable
pieces of the document. If this is a common
operation, it may be worth optimizing or caching the
serialized document for reuse, which creates a
possible concurrency problem. Document
serialization can be optimized by maintaining addressable
units in document order, keeping names in stored nodes
rather than name IDs and using coarser granularity, which
leads to fewer objects retrieved from disk.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbff580.0xcf89f8"></a>
Indexing</h2></div></div><p>
Proper specification and use of indexes can increase
query speeds by orders of magnitude. However,
indexes consume space on disk and in the cache&mdash;a
classic space versus speed trade-off. Under certain
situations, the presence of indexes slows operations.
When frequently updating indexed data, time spent
re-indexing can offset the benefit of indexed
access.
</p><p>
The data models for querying XML imply that
virtually all indexes deal with elements, attributes
and their respective text content, as well as
possible data types represented by their value
strings. However, there is no standard or convention
regarding how to specify indexes or even what is indexed
and how. Different XML databases have made different
choices regarding indexes in these areas:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Index Type&mdash;structure, value, full-text.
</p></li><li><p>
Index Scope&mdash;document, collection.
</p></li><li><p>
Index Target&mdash;document, node.
</p></li><li><p>
Index Control&mdash;automatic, voluntary, required.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbff580.0xcef700"></a>
Index Type</h2></div></div><p>
Structural indexes are used for tracking structure
and path information, such as &ldquo;track existence of
all element nodes with the path /a/b/c&rdquo; or
&ldquo;track all paths to the node c.&rdquo; Such indexes are
useful for navigational portions of queries. Some
indexes reduce the result set to a smaller set of
possible results, rather than give a single
definitive result. For example, the index above that
tracks all paths /a/b/c can be positive about its
answer to the query /a/b/c. The index that tracks
all paths to c cannot be definite, because it
also contains entries for paths such as /e/f/c.
</p><p>
Value indexes are used to track all values for
specific elements or attributes. A value index on
the element &ldquo;color&rdquo; would have an index entry for
every separate instance of color and would be
useful for a query such as <tt  >//color[.='green']</tt>.
In addition, value indexes may be typed so that comparisons can
be performed correctly. The typed data model of
XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 brings a long list of
potential data types from the XML Schema
recommendation, such as xs:date, xs:time and
various numeric formats. Support for typed indexes
allows applications to use them directly rather
than modify their content to map, for example,
xs:datetime to integer, so that range-based
comparisons can be used.
</p><p>
Full-text indexing is a large topic unto itself. There
is a working draft for full-text extensions to
XQuery, but it is not yet in general use. Some
native XML database products implement what they
call full-text indexing, which minimally is a word
index over a document. Because there is no standard,
a full-text index requires a proprietaryy query
language or extension as an interface.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbff580.0xcefa18"></a>
Index Scope</h2></div></div><p>
Most native XML databases store documents in a
collection. The scope of a given index could be
collection-wide or it could be restricted to a
single document. A native XML database system can
choose the index scope it implements. Queries
against a collection can return documents or sets of
nodes within documents. In order to support
efficient restriction of a query to a manageable set
of documents, the system must support indexes at the
collection scope. This does not mean that it is not
also possible to have indexes at the document scope,
which contain entries that apply only to a given
document.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbff580.0xcefb20"></a>
Index Target</h2></div></div><p>
Related to scope is the target or the object referenced
by an index entry. It can be a document or an
object within a document. An index is capable of
pointing down to the addressable unit in the system,
but such granularity is not always necessary and
can be expensive. Because navigational operations
within a document stored with fine granularity are
not as expensive as those used for intact document
storage, due to parsing, it can be sufficient to
return the document element for further navigation.
Although this is possible, it is the case that most
database systems with fine-grained document storage
reference directly to nodes in indexes rather
than to the containing documents.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbff580.0xcefc28"></a>
Index Control</h2></div></div><p>
Another dimension of index type is how indexes are
specified. Voluntary indexes are specified explicitly
by an interface to the system. These
indexes allow for some experimentation to find the
minimal useful set of indexes. Some systems have
automatic indexes, where a well-defined set of
indexes always is created, except for those that
are disabled explicitly, by way of configuration or
interface. The system also may have required
indexes, which cannot be disabled because they are
necessary for proper functioning of the system.

Summary</h2></div></div><p>
This article has highlighted the importance of
storage granularity and indexing within the design
of a native XML database. These core choices drive
the performance, scalability and features available
within the system.
