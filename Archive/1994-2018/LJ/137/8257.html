Anything that you can do from a shell command, you can
do remotely with SSH. Here's how to set up keys for effective,
secure remote tasks from cron jobs and scripts.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1774348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Using insecure protocols leaves your data and connected machines
vulnerable to attack. Remote server management requirements demand that
security be given a top priority. This article explains my process
for using OpenSSH in unattended scripts and cron jobs.
</p><p>
Most readers are familiar with the secure shell (SSH)
protocol, which creates a secure tunnel for commands,
data and passwords to travel across the network. Recently, my workplace
was faced with some challenges in securely setting up scripts through
cron. We use SSH because it resolves the major problems with rsh; rsh sends
clear text over the network and has weak host-based authentication. But
our challenge became how to deal with password prompts when using SSH in
unattended jobs. For example, we run <tt  >df -k</tt>,
<tt  >top</tt> and <tt  >swapon -s</tt> to get
remote server statistics and alert our team if problems
exist.
</p><p>
If you also still are using rsh, the SSH client, ssh, makes
a perfect replacement in scripts. Modifications typically are minor.
For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for host in $servers
do
rsh $host df -k
done
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1774660"></a></h2></div></div><p>
simply becomes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for host in $servers
do
ssh $host df -k
done
</pre>
</p><p>
SSH supports a wide range of authentication systems, the most common
being Kerberos, Rhosts, Public-key and Password. Because we didn't have a
Kerberos infrastructure in place, our readily available options to solve
this problem were to echo the password in the script, use Rhosts, use
ssh-agent or use public keys.
</p><p>
Our first options presented some challenges and weaknesses. First, simply
echoing the password in a script is not a simple task, as SSH does
not read from standard input. To make it do so would require advanced scripting
techniques. More important, you would need to put your password either in
the script itself or in a file on the filesystem. Although you could set
proper permissions, getting access to the password would be a relatively easy
task for a determined intruder. It could be as simple as restoring data from a
backup or even viewing the password on-screen. This method was not an option
for us.
</p><p>
Second, we considered host-based authentication, which is how users
executing the rsh command are granted access. Because users are granted
or denied access based on the host they are logging in from, no password
is needed. This solution may work in some situations where security
concerns are light, but the ability to pretend to be another host, to
IP spoof and to disrupt DNS does exist. Also, due to the fact that once a host
has been impersonated successfully, all users have been compromised on
the remote host, we decided we needed something more secure.
</p><p>
Our third option was to use ssh-agent. Before we discuss this option
here, though, we need to cover public keys and their use. Instead of
using a plain-text password, SSH has the ability to use public key
cryptography. This means that when a client connects to a server, it has a
conversation with the server and proves its identity based on advanced
mathematical computations.
</p><p>
Let's walk through the setup to generate a set of public and private
SSH keys to allow a user named scripts to log in from hostA to hostB,
assuming the user exists on both hosts:
</p><p>
1) Generate the keys:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[scripts@hostA]$ssh-keygen  -t dsa
Generating public/private dsa key pair.

Enter file in which to save the key (/home/scripts/.ssh/id_dsa):
Created directory '/home/scripts/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): XXXX
Enter same passphrase again: XXXX
Your identification has been saved in /home/scripts/.ssh/id_dsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/scripts/.ssh/id_dsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
41:03:aa:dc:cc:b9:39:50:65:bc:ee:7b:36:d2:64:7a scripts@hostA
</pre>
</p><p>
2) Copy public key to hostB from hostA:

<pre     class="programlisting">

scp /home/scripts/.ssh/id_dsa.pub \
hostB:/home/scripts/.ssh/authorized_keys

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1774ad8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
scp is an encrypted replacement for rcp and simply copies files in a secured manner.
</p><p>
The authorized_keys file is a file that contains the public identities,
or public keys, of users who can log in to your account by using public key
authentication. All users maintain their own authorized_keys file,
which typically lives in the hidden .ssh directory in a user's home
directory. Users also may configure security restrictions to public
keys here as well, which we review below.
</p><p>
The authorized_keys file is not created when you first run ssh-keygen to create
your public and private keys. As a best practice, we recommend
permissions of 600 for this file.
</p><p>
At this point, userA should be able to log in to hostB without a password
using public key technology. Now, of course, we still have the same problem
with echoing the passphrase into a script. As I mentioned, SSH does not
take input from standard input, so this represents the same scripting
challenge as before. To eliminate the need to retype your
password continually, SSH comes with ssh-agent. You use ssh-agent as follows, in
combination with ssh-add:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[scripts@hostA scripts]$ ssh-agent bash
[scripts@hostA .ssh]$ ssh-add  id_dsa
Identity added: id_dsa (id_dsa)
</pre>
</p><p>
We pass our shell to ssh-agent, and it inherits the keys we add with
ssh-add. Now we need only type our passphrase once and we can use
our key default key, id_dsa.pub, to be authenticated. An important note
about using multiple keys in an interactive session with SSH is how you
need to call SSH. For example, if you have created three private
keys&mdash;your default key, id_dsa, and two other keys called backup and monitor to use for different
tasks&mdash;you simply would call SSH with the -i parameter. This is
done to make sure you're using your new key while logging in to the
remote SSH server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[scripts@hostA]$ssh -i backupkey hostB
</pre>
</p><p>
When you are using ssh-agent, you may believe you simply type in
<tt  >ssh -i backup</tt> to use your backup identity. This
is not quite the case, though, as
the ssh-agent typically uses the key that is on the top of its key
list. To get a listing of all the keys you have loaded in ssh-agent, run
<tt  >ssh-add -l</tt> for a listing of fingerprints of all identities
currently loaded in the agent:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[scripts@hostA scripts]$ssh-add -l
1024 df:ab:8e:d7:e4:bd:35:f6:b3:2e:76:6b:dd:71:2f:fe monitor (DSA)
1024 4e:4c:00:ba:1e:5d:60:08:f2:b8:2e:d4:59:1e:ff:2f id_dsa (DSA)
1024 0a:72:24:9e:0a:cd:e2:e4:5f:93:cb:ac:66:78:03:f6 backup (DSA)
</pre>
</p><p>
Because ssh-agent typically favors the key listed first, it favors the
monitor key. To be able to use the backup key, you
need to unset the shell variable SSH_AUTH_SOCK and then point SSH to
the identity you want to use, as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

[scripts@hostA scripts]env -u SSH_AUTH_SOCK \
  ssh -i backup  hostB

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1775000"></a></h2></div></div><p>
After doing this, you will be using the proper key as intended.
</p><p>
Using ssh-agent is, of course, a great time saver for interactive use.
When used in scripts, however, a human still needs to type in the passphrase at least
once when the machine boots. This ends up being the best we can achieve
with ssh-agent, even with scripts to automate most of the procedure. For
more information on that topic, refer to <span   class="emphasis"><em>SSH, The Secure Shell:
The Definitive Guide</em></span>. Ultimately, the ssh-agent option also did
not meet our needs in deploying secure batch jobs, as our goal was to
automate the jobs totally.
</p><p>
That left us with the option of using public keys without a password. The
remainder of this article focuses on that setup, how to secure it further
and some options to consider when using this setup. In any environment,
thorough planning and review of security polices should occur before
deploying or modifying security configurations.
</p><p>
The first method in securing our setup is to use the
<tt  >from=</tt> directive
in the authorized_keys file. The syntax looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from="host1,host2" KEY
</pre>
</p><p>
What this says is allow only users from host1 or host2 and authenticate
them against the public key matching KEY. For example, to restrict
logins from only hostA and hostB for our user scripts, the authorized_keys
would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from="hostA,hostB" ssh-dss AAAAB..Aqbcw= scripts@hostA
</pre>
</p><p>
This is by no means a foolproof restriction. As I mentioned before, it
is possible to pretend to be another host and spoof an IP. But this
restriction adds a layer of security and increases the effort needed to compromise our
host. Notice that I intentionally shortened the key, which is quite
long, due to space constraints. Be aware that the from= syntax is sensitive
to short and long DNS names. HostA is not the same as HostA.somewhere.
</p><p>
Our second line of defense in securing our script setup is to use the
<tt  >command =""</tt> directive, also specified in the
authorized_keys file. The syntax for this looks like:


<pre     class="programlisting">
command ="<span   class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span>",  KEY
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells SSH to run <span   class="emphasis"><em><tt>command</tt></em></span>
and then exit. It effectively limits your ability to run commands on the
remote server. As you might expect, you can combine both of these in your
authorized_keys file; simply make sure you separate the options by a comma:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from="hostA,hostB",command="/bin/df -k"  ssh-dss AAAAB3N...Aqbcw= userA@hostB
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, should someone compromise this user and key,
the worst that can be done is retrieving a listing of
disk space on the remote host. In fact, this is the
only command you can run with this key. In order
to run multiple commands securely, you have a few
options. First, consider calling a script instead
of command. For example, run <tt  >top</tt>, <tt  >df
-k</tt> and
<tt  >hostname</tt> from a shell script named myscript.sh and
set <tt  >command="/path/to/myscript.sh"</tt>. Second, if you
need to run multiple commands at different times during
the day to same host, you could create another key for
your user. This time, use the -f option to specify
a file other than the default:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[scripts@hostA]$ssh-keygen  -t dsa -f backupkey
Generating public/private dsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in backupkey.
Your public key has been saved in backupkey.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
14:ac:c5:5f:65:69:2f:8d:cf:0a:70:9e:5c:4e:c7:84 scripts@hostA
</pre>
</p><p>
You would copy the contents of the new public key, backupkey.pub, to the
authorized_keys file of the users on the hosts you want them to access,
the same as the default key. Be sure to set the new
<tt  >command=""</tt> for your new key and the new command
you want to run.
</p><p>
Now, you would use the -i parameter to make sure you're using your new
key while logging in to the remote SSH server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[scripts@hostA]$ssh -i backupkey hostB
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167c580.0x1775a50"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Tip
</b></p><p>
To add another public key on a remote host without overwriting your
original authorized_keys file, you can run this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$cat ~/.ssh/newkey.pub | ssh -l user host "cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys"
</pre>
</p></div><p>
Finally, you could create a separate user for this task. For example, you
could create one user to monitor disks and one to automate backups. Each
configuration has its advantages and drawbacks.
The question to answer
here is, &ldquo;Do you want to manage keys or user
accounts?&rdquo; I prefer to have
different keys and make a note of them with a comment.
</p><p>
One piece of the SSH key we have not considered yet is the comment
field. The default comment for userA's public key created on HOSTA is
userA@HOSTA. Basically, everything after the key is ignored as a
comment. So to keep track of keys and what they are used for, I make a comment
in the remote server's authorized_keys file. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh-dss AAAAB3NzaC1kc3MAAA......Jw= scripts@hostC-Key used for disk monitoring
</pre>
</p><p>
Our third line of defense is the ability to limit the traffic we
forward. We have three main options here that merit discussion. First, the
no-port-forwarding option means what is says. When this key logs on,
the ability to forward TCP/IP ports is denied. Forwarding ports
is a great way to bypass firewalls; hence, the account used to run
scripts should be given the ability to run only the commands necessary. The
ability to forward TCP/IP ports is a potential security problem, so we
restrict it.
</p><p>
Second, no-X11-forwarding tells the SSH process not to forward any X11
connections upon login. Any attempt to do so returns an error. We see that
this is simply another way for an intruder to exploit our hosts, so we
disable it. Again, we try to lock down what the account that logs in can
do, but we also permit it to perform its job.
</p><p>
Third, no-agent-forwarding in the authorized_keys denies this
key the ability to forward its ssh-agent and stored keys to another
host. This reduces complexity and also takes away another avenue for a
potential intruder to trespass.
</p><p>
The final option in the authorized_keys file we
want to use is the no-pty option, which says not to
allocate a pseudo-tty when logging in. Non-interactive
commands continue to work using the associated
key; however, you can no longer issue commands through an
interactive session. Should an intruder gain access to your private
key and somehow circumvent the other options, this option effectively
ensures that he or she cannot issue interactive commands to do any damage.
</p><p>
With the above options in place, we have a reasonably restricted key
that still can perform its job. Our final authorized_keys file
looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from="hostA,hostB",command="/bin/myscript.sh",no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty
ssh-dss AAAAB3....o9M9qz4xqGCqGXoJw= scripts@hostA
</pre>
</p><p>
Before we finish our discussion on options, let's
look at two more that are not related directly to
security. When running SSH in scripts, we use the -q
and -o &ldquo;BatchMode=yes&rdquo; command-line options. The -q
stands for quiet mode. The man page for sshd sums
this up nicely:
&ldquo;Nothing is sent to the system log. Normally the beginning,
authentication, and termination of each connection is logged.&rdquo; This is
useful for suppressing warnings otherwise interpreted as command output. The
-o
&ldquo;BatchMode yes&rdquo; makes sure SSH does not prompt the user. So our script
changes a little more:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for host in $servers
do
ssh -q -o "BatchMode=yes" $host df -k
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Because we are specifying an option on the command line, we are certain the
options will not be overridden as they take precedence. Typically, the
global client configs are looked at first, usually /etc/ssh_config; then the
local client configs, usually ~/.ssh/config; and finally
the command line. As several versions and variations of SSH are available,
always consult the man page for correct locations and syntax.
</p><p>
Ensuring proper options are set for each particular key and using a
layered security approach goes a long way in making your servers
less vulnerable to attacks. Setting the least privileges possible reduces
the potential damage done during a successful attack. Using these
methods, your data and networks become more secure and still run efficiently.
