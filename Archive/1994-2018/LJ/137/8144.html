The old sleep_on() function won't work reliably in an age of SMP systems
and hyperthreaded processors. Here's how to make a process sleep in a
safe, cross-platform way.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1987348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In Linux kernel programming, there are numerous
occasions when processes wait until something
occurs or when sleeping processes need to be woken up to get
some work done. There are different ways to achieve
these things.
</p><p>
All of the discussion in this article refers to kernel mode
execution. A reference to a process means execution
in kernel space in the context of that process.
</p><p>
Some kernel code examples have been reformatted to
fit this print format. Line numbers refer to lines in the
original file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1987500"></a>
The schedule() Function</h2></div></div><p>
In Linux, the ready-to-run processes are maintained
on a run queue. A ready-to-run process has the state
TASK_RUNNING. Once the timeslice of a running
process is over, the Linux scheduler picks up
another appropriate process from the run queue and
allocates CPU power to that process.
</p><p>
A process also voluntarily can relinquish the
CPU. The schedule() function could be used by a
process to indicate voluntarily to the scheduler that
it can schedule some other process on the processor.
</p><p>
Once the process is scheduled back again, execution
begins from the point where the process had stopped&mdash;that is, execution
begins from the call to the schedule() function.
</p><p>
At times, processes want to wait until a certain event
occurs, such as a device to initialise, I/O to
complete or a timer to expire. In such a case,
the process is said to sleep on that event. A process
can go to sleep using the schedule() function. The
following code puts the executing process to sleep:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sleeping_task = current;
set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
schedule();
func1();
/* The rest of the code */
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1987768"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's take a look at what is happening in there.
In the first statement, we store a reference to this
process' task structure. current, which really is a
macro, gives a pointer to the executing process'
task_structure.
set_current_state changes the state of the
currently executing process from TASK_RUNNING to
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. In this case, as mentioned
above, the schedule()
function simply should schedule another process. But
that happens only if the state of the task is
TASK_RUNNING. When the schedule() function is called
with the state as TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE or
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, an additional step is
performed: the currently executing process is moved
off the run queue before another process is
scheduled. The effect of this is the executing
process goes to sleep, as it no longer is on the
run queue. Hence, it never is scheduled by the
scheduler. And, that is how a process can sleep.
</p><p>
Now let's wake it up. Given a reference to a task
structure, the process could be woken up by calling:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wake_up_process(sleeping_task);
</pre>
</p><p>
As you might have guessed, this sets the task
state to TASK_RUNNING and puts the task back on the
run queue. Of course, the process runs only when
the scheduler looks at it the next time around.
</p><p>
So now you know the simplest way of sleeping and
waking in the kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x19879d0"></a>
Interruptible and Uninterruptible Sleep</h2></div></div><p>
A process can sleep in two different modes,
interruptible and uninterruptible. In an
interruptible sleep, the process could be woken up
for processing of signals. In an
uninterruptible sleep, the process could not be
woken up other than by issuing an explicit wake_up.
Interruptible sleep is the preferred way of
sleeping, unless there is a situation in which signals
cannot be handled at all, such as device I/O.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1987ad8"></a>
Lost Wake-Up Problem</h2></div></div><p>
Almost always, processes go to sleep after checking
some condition. The lost wake-up problem arises
out of a race condition that occurs while
a process goes to conditional sleep. It is a classic problem in
operating systems.
</p><p>
Consider two processes, A and B. Process A is
processing from a list, consumer, while the process
B is adding to this list, producer. When the list
is empty, process A sleeps. Process B wakes A up when
it appends anything to the list. The code looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Process A:
1  spin_lock(&amp;list_lock);
2  if(list_empty(&amp;list_head)) {
3      spin_unlock(&amp;list_lock);
4      set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
5      schedule();
6      spin_lock(&amp;list_lock);
7  }
8
9  /* Rest of the code ... */
10 spin_unlock(&amp;list_lock);

Process B:
100  spin_lock(&amp;list_lock);
101  list_add_tail(&amp;list_head, new_node);
102  spin_unlock(&amp;list_lock);
103  wake_up_process(processa_task);

</pre>
</p><p>
There is one problem with this situation. It may happen
that after process A executes line 3 but before it executes
line 4, process B is scheduled on another processor. In this timeslice,
process B executes all its instructions, 100 through
103. Thus, it performs a wake-up on process A, which
has not yet gone to sleep. Now, process A,
wrongly assuming that it safely has performed the
check for list_empty, sets the state to
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE and goes to sleep.
</p><p>
Thus, a wake up from process B is lost. This is
known as the lost wake-up problem. Process A sleeps,
even though there are nodes available on the list.
</p><p>
This problem could be avoided by restructuring the
code for process A in the following manner:


<pre     class="programlisting">

Process A:

1  set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
2  spin_lock(&amp;list_lock);
3  if(list_empty(&amp;list_head)) {
4         spin_unlock(&amp;list_lock);
5         schedule();
6         spin_lock(&amp;list_lock);
7  }
8  set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
9
10 /* Rest of the code ... */
11 spin_unlock(&amp;list_lock);

</pre>
</p><p>
This code avoids the lost wake-up problem. How? We
have changed our current state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE,
before we test the condition. So, what has changed?
The change is that whenever a wake_up_process is
called for a process whose state is TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE
or TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, and the process has not
yet called schedule(), the state of the process is
changed back to TASK_RUNNING.
</p><p>
Thus, in the above example, even if a wake-up is
delivered by process B at any point after the check
for list_empty is made, the state of A
automatically is changed to TASK_RUNNING. Hence, the
call to schedule() does not put process A to sleep; it
merely schedules it out for a while, as
discussed earlier. Thus, the wake-up no longer is
lost.
</p><p>
Here is a code snippet of a real-life example from
the Linux kernel
(linux-2.6.11/kernel/sched.c: 4254):

<pre     class="programlisting">
4253  /* Wait for kthread_stop */
4254  set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
4255  while (!kthread_should_stop()) {
4256          schedule();
4257          set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
4258  }
4259  __set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
4260 return 0;
</pre>
</p><p>
This code belongs to the migration_thread. The
thread cannot exit until the kthread_should_stop()
function returns 1. The thread sleeps while waiting
for the function to return 0.
</p><p>
As can be seen from the code, the check for the
kthread_should_stop condition is made only after the
state is TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE. Hence, the wake-up
received after the condition check but before the
call to schedule() function is not lost.

Wait Queues</h2></div></div><p>
Wait queues are a higher-level mechanism used to
put processes to sleep and wake them up. In most
instances, you use wait queues. They are needed when more than one process
wants to sleep on the occurrence of one or more than
one event.
</p><p>
A wait queue for an event is a list of nodes. Each
node points to a process waiting for that event. An
individual node in this list is called a wait queue
entry. Processes that want to sleep while the event
occurs add themselves to this list before going to
sleep. On the occurrence of the event, one or more
processes on the list are woken up. Upon waking up, the
processes remove themselves from the list.
</p><p>
A wait queue could be defined and initialised in the
following manner:

<pre     class="programlisting">

wait_queue_head_t my_event;
init_waitqueue_head(&amp;my_event);

</pre>
</p><p>
The same effect could be achieved by using this macro:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD(my_event);
</pre>
</p><p>
Any process that wants to wait on my_event could
use either of the following options:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
wait_event(&amp;my_event, (event_present == 1) );
</p></li><li><p>
wait_event_interruptible(&amp;my_event, (event_present == 1) );
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The interruptible version 2 of the options above
puts the process to an interruptible sleep, whereas
the other (option 1) puts the process into an uninterruptible
sleep.
</p><p>
In most instances, a process goes to sleep
only after checking some condition for the
availability of the resource. To facilitate that,
both these functions take an expression as the
second argument. The process goes to sleep only if
the expression evaluates to false. Care is taken to
avoid the lost wake-up problem.
</p><p>
Old kernel versions used the functions sleep_on()
and interruptible_sleep_on(), but those two functions
can introduce bad race conditions and should not be used.
</p><p>
Let's now take a look at some of the calls for
waking up process sleeping on a wait queue:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
wake_up(&amp;my_event);: wakes up only one process from the wait queue.
</p></li><li><p>
wake_up_all(&amp;my_event);: wakes up all the processes on the wait
queue.
</p></li><li><p>
wake_up_interruptible(&amp;my_event);: wakes up only one process from
the wait queue that is in interruptible sleep.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1988898"></a>
Wait Queues: Putting It Together</h2></div></div><p>
Let us look at a real-life example of how wait queues
are used. smbiod is the I/O thread that
performs I/O operations for the SMB filesystem.
Here is a code snippet for the smbiod thread
(linux-2.6.11/fs/smbfs/smbiod.c: 291):

<pre     class="programlisting">

291 static int smbiod(void *unused)
292 {
293     daemonize("smbiod");
294
295     allow_signal(SIGKILL);
296
297     VERBOSE("SMB Kernel thread starting "
                "(%d)...\n", current-&gt;pid);
298
299     for (;;) {
300             struct smb_sb_info *server;
301             struct list_head *pos, *n;
302
303             /* FIXME: Use poll? */
304             wait_event_interruptible(smbiod_wait,
305                     test_bit(SMBIOD_DATA_READY,
                                 &amp;smbiod_flags));
...
...             /* Some processing */
312
313             clear_bit(SMBIOD_DATA_READY,
                          &amp;smbiod_flags);
314
...             /* Code to perform the requested I/O */
...
...
337     }
338
339     VERBOSE("SMB Kernel thread exiting (%d)...\n",
                current-&gt;pid);
340     module_put_and_exit(0);
341 }
342

</pre>
</p><p>
As is clear from the code, smbiod is a thread
that runs in a continuous loop as it processes I/O
requests. When there are no I/O requests to process, the thread
goes to sleep on the wait queue smbiod_wait. This
is achieved by calling wait_event_interruptible
(line 304). This call causes the smbiod to sleep
only if the DATA_READY bit is set. As mentioned
earlier, wait_event_interruptible takes care to
avoid the lost wake-up problem.
</p><p>
Now, when a process wants to get some I/O done, it
sets the DATA_READY bit in the smbiod_flags and
wakes up the smbiod thread to perform I/O. This can
be seen in the following code snippet
(linux-2.6.11/fs/smbfs/smbiod.c: 57):

<pre     class="programlisting">

57 void smbiod_wake_up(void)
58 {
59     if (smbiod_state == SMBIOD_DEAD)
60         return;
61     set_bit(SMBIOD_DATA_READY, &amp;smbiod_flags);
62     wake_up_interruptible(&amp;smbiod_wait);
63 }

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1988b00"></a></h2></div></div><p>
wake_up_interruptible wakes up one process that was
sleeping on the smbiod_wait waitqueue. The function
smb_add_request (linux-2.6.11/fs/smbfs/request.c:
279) calls the smbiod_wake_up function when it adds
new requests for processing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x1988c08"></a>
Thundering Herd Problem</h2></div></div><p>
Another classical operating system problem arises due
to the use of the wake_up_all function. Let us consider
a scenario in which a set of processes are sleeping on
a wait queue, wanting to acquire a lock.
</p><p>
Once the process that has acquired the lock
is done with it, it releases the lock and wakes
up all the processes sleeping on the wait queue. All
the processes try to grab the lock. Eventually,
only one of these acquires the lock and the rest
go back to sleep.
</p><p>
This behavior is not good for performance. If we
already know that only one process is
going to resume while the rest of the processes
go back to sleep again, why wake them up
in the first place? It consumes valuable CPU cycles
and incurs context-switching overheads. This
problem is called the thundering herd problem.
That is why using the wake_up_all function
should be done carefully, only when you know that it
is required. Otherwise, go ahead and use the wake_up
function that wakes up only one process at a time.
</p><p>
So, when would the wake_up_all function be used? It
is used in scenarios when processes want to take a
shared lock on something. For example, processes
waiting to read data on a page could all be woken
up at the same moment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x188f580.0x197f6a8"></a>
Time-Bound Sleep</h2></div></div><p>
You frequently may want to delay the execution of
your process for a given amount of time. It may be
required to allow the hardware to catch up or to
carry out an activity after specified time intervals, such
as polling a device, flushing data to disk or retransmitting
a network request. This can be achieved by the function
schedule_timeout(timeout), a variant of schedule(). This
function puts the process to sleep until timeout jiffies
have elapsed. jiffies is a kernel variable that is
incremented for every timer interrupt.
</p><p>
As with schedule(), the state of the process has to
be changed to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE/TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE before calling this function. If
the process is woken up earlier than timeout
jiffies have elapsed, the number of jiffies left is
returned; otherwise, zero is returned.
</p><p>
Let us take a look at a real-life example
(linux-2.6.11/arch/i386/kernel/apm.c: 1415):

<pre     class="programlisting">
1415  set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
1416  for (;;) {
1417     schedule_timeout(APM_CHECK_TIMEOUT);
1418     if (exit_kapmd)
1419         break;
1421      * Ok, check all events, check for idle
....      * (and mark us sleeping so as not to
....      * count towards the load average)..
1423      */
1424      set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE);
1425      apm_event_handler();
1426  }
</pre>
</p><p>
This code belongs to the APM thread. The thread
polls the APM BIOS for events at intervals of
APM_CHECK_TIMEOUT jiffies. As can be seen from the
code, the thread calls schedule_timeout() to sleep
for the given duration of time, after which it calls
apm_event_handler() to process any events.
</p><p>
You also may use a more convenient API, with which
you can specify time in milliseconds and seconds:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
msleep(time_in_msec);
</p></li><li><p>
msleep_interruptible(time_in_msec);
</p></li><li><p>
ssleep(time_in_sec);
</p></li></ol></div><p>
msleep(time_in_msec); and msleep_interruptible(time_in_msec);
accept the time to sleep in milliseconds, while ssleep(time_in_sec); accepts the time to
sleep in seconds. These higher-level routines
internally convert the time into jiffies,
appropriately change the state of the process and
call schedule_timeout(), thus making the process
sleep.
</p><p>
I hope that you now have a basic understanding of
how processes safely can sleep and wake up in the
kernel. To understand the internal working of wait
queues and advanced uses, look at the implementations
of init_waitqueue_head, as well as variants of wait_event
and wake_up.
