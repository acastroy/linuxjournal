README for "Implementing a deltree Command in Linux"

1.  There were errors in the original tgz file which should be eliminated
with this version.

2.  The source files may be compiled using this command:

    g++ -o deltree funcs.cpp strstack.cpp strnode.cpp deltree.cpp

3.  The "deltree" program is intended to demonstrate how to walk a directory
tree and address file maintenance issues.  Please feel free to modify, adapt
or experiment with the program so that it addresses your particular needs.
