Listing 1. pseudo-code for turnkey application startup

Try to mount CDROM containing techcity home
 directory over hard drive home - no need to check
 return code
Start "reboot monitor" process
log in (su) as user "techcity" and execute startx
if CD was mounted:
  .xinitrc shuts down reboot monitor, disables
   screen savers and power management, and starts
   application
else:
  .xinitrc runs Python script which asks user to
   insert an application CD, then waits for user
   to click on "done" button - that button tells
   reboot monitor to restart system
unmount CDROM
