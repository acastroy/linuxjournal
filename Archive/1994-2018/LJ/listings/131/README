This application is a sample for a Linux Journal article discussing
asynchronous Twisted programming. Although it is useful, it probably does have
bugs and is not recommended for production use.

To run the program, first you should download the latest version of Twisted from
http://www.twistedmatrix.com/. After installing Twisted, you can configure the
proxy server by changing constants at the top of SimpleDejunkingProxy.py. After
that, it should be ready to run.

This program has been tested Python 2.3 and Twisted 1.3.0.
