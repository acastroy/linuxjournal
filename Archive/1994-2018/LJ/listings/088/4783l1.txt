Listing 1: PrintFoo.java, a short command-line program which modifies
the contents of the text with ID  "firstpara" and then prints the
document's contents to standard output.

// Bring in the DOM classes which come with Enhydra
import org.w3c.dom.html.*;

public class PrintFoo {

    // We'll only define one method, to be invoked from the command line.
    public static void main (String[] args) {

        // Create an instance of our "foo" page object.
        foo myfoo = new foo();

        // Change the text in our "firstpara" paragraph.
        myfoo.setTextFirstpara("This has been changed");

        // Display the results
        System.out.print(myfoo.toDocument());
    }
}
