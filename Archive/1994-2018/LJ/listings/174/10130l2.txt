007  When play begins, say "It's Saturday, a nice one at that, and you've been
008      called in to fix a server that's on the blink. Again.[paragraph break]
009      You've had it. This server is going to run Linux from this day
010      forward! The process will be easy - just put the disc into the server
011      and away we go. Now where is that Ubuntu CD?"
012  
013  The Break Room is a room. "Your standard break room. A fridge, and a long
014      counter take up one wall. East is the outside world and west is the

038      closed container. The description of the Ubuntu CD is "An automatic
039      recovery CD, guaranteed to fix almost any server.[paragraph break]
040      Ok, it's just an install CD that auto-installs Ubuntu, but hey, if it
041      works, it works." Understand "disc" or "disk" as the Ubuntu CD.
042  
043  After opening your backpack for the first time: award 2 points; continue
044      the action.

047  pick up the Ubuntu CD."
048  
049  Instead of going east from the break room, say "You take one look outside
050      and think better of it. The daystar is too bright and terrible to face
051      today. Besides, you have work to do."
052  
053  East of the Break Room is The Outside World.
054  
055  West of the Break Room is the Hallway.
056  
057  The Hallway is a room. "Bereft of features, adornment or even adequate
058      lighting, this hallway is as plain as they come. Doors lead east back
059      to the break room, north to the server room, or west to the restrooms."
060  
061  North of the hallway is the Server Room. West of the hallway is the
062      restrooms.
063

079      key card to open the server room door and step into your
080      world.[paragraph break]"
081  
082  The Server Room is a room. "The fans, the lights, the chill . . . yep,
083      it's a server room. Full of servers from a dozen different
084      manufacturers, each with their own quirks.[paragraph break]Your
085      attention is immediately drawn to a server 2/3 of the way up rack 7.
086      The little indicator light is blinking red, and it is beeping."
087  
088  The old server is scenery in the server room. Understand "machine" and
089      "computer" and "ancient" as the old server. The description of the old
090      server is "The indicator light on this ancient server is blinking
091      orange. The rest of the front is featureless except for the CD tray.
092      The beeping seems to emenate from somewhere inside the server."
093  
094  The CD Tray is part of the old server. It is a closed openable container.
095      The description is "It's a CD tray. Just like every other CD tray."
096  
097  Every turn while in the server room, say "[one of]The beeping is driving
098      you crazy.[or]It's hard to think, with all of the beeping.[or]The
099      monotony of the beeping is maddening.[or]You can't stand the
100      beeping.[or]The beeping reminds you of your alarm clock.[or]beep . . .
101      beep . . . beep . . . beep . . . beep . . . beep . . .[or]If you don't
102      stop the beeping soon, you'll loose what little hair you have
103      left.[purely at random]"
104  
105  After opening the CD tray for the first time: award 2 points; say "You
106      press the button and the CD tray pops out."
107  
108  Every turn: if the Ubuntu CD is in the cd tray and the cd tray is closed,
109      end the game in victory.
110  
111  When play ends when the game ended in victory, say "With the CD in the
112      tray, you quickly reboot the server.[paragraph break]After the bios
113      posts, your disc starts doing its thing and before you know it the
114      server is happily running Ubuntu, and even more than that, the beeping
115      has stopped. Yay!".
