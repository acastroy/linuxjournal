# Establish range stored in image.
set image range 4.9 30.4
# Set up a color scale ranging from blue at 4.9C 
# to red at 30.4C, in a spectrum. These endpoints
# are specified in HSB coordinates, where H is the
# hue, S the saturation and B the brightness. The
# HSB triplet 0.666 1 1 is saturated blue, and
# 0.000 1 1 is saturated red. We run over hues to
# get a spectrum. Note the use of backslash for 
# continuation across lines.
