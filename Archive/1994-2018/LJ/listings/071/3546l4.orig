# /etc/rc.d/rc.local: Local system initialization
# script.
# Put any local setup commands in here:
# Turn on Kernel IP forwarding
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# Set default policy forwarding packets to DENY
ipchains -P forward DENY
# Append a rule to forward our packets out of our 
# local network, masquerading the IP addresses of 
# our local LAN with the Internet IP address of the 
# Firewall.
