Your ethernet card was not initialized properly. 
Here are some reasons why this may have happened,
and the solutions:
1. Your kernel does not contain support for your 
card. Including all the network drivers in a Linux
kernel can make it too large to even boot, and
sometimes including extra drivers can cause system
hangs. To support your ethernet, either edit 
/etc/rc.d/rc.modules to load the support at boot
time, or compile and install a kernel that 
contains support.
2. You don't have an ethernet card, in which
case you should comment out this section of 
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1. (Unless you don't mind 
seeing this error...)
