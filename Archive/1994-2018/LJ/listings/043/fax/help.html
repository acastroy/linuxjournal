<P>
<A NAME="one">
<H3>Sending a Fax to One Person</H3>
<P>
The fields to send a fax are the recipent's name, fax number, and your name.
Your name is automatically filled in based on the computer you are using at
the time. Unless you are using someone else's computer the from field will
already be correct.
<P>For the phone number, put in the number as you would type it, including
the international codes. 
<P><EM>MAKE SURE</EM> that the "Single Person" checkbox at the top of the form
is checked. Otherwise your fax will be sent to a large group of people.
<P>Select one or more documents in the list below the fields. The number of
pages will be determined by the software and put on the cover sheet.

<P>
<A NAME="mult">
<H3>Sending a Fax to a Group of People</H3>
<P>
Sending to a list is about the same as sending to a single person. Be sure
that the "List of People" checkbox is checked. In the drop-down list below
it, choose the group of people that the fax should go to. All the other steps
are the same. You don't need to enter anything for the Name and Fax Number
blanks, but the From blank should be set.

<P>
<A NAME="status">
<H3>Checking the System</H3>
<P>
The System Status is available for diagnostics. It shows what the modem is 
currently doing and what faxes are in the queue.

<P>
<A NAME="newdoc">
<H3>Making New Documents</H3>
<P>
When you want to add a new file to the available documents for faxing, it 
must be saved as a PostScript file. The files are stored on a server 
available in the Chooser as "Fax Mail Server". You use your email
address and password to get access. After entering your name and password,
pick "Data Directory" and hit OK. This will show up on your desktop as 
another disk drive. The files go in "Data Directory:fax:psfiles:".
<P>Most applications have PostScript available
as an option. Pick Print from the program you are in and look for the 
"Destination" buttons. There should be choices for "Printer" and "File".
Put the file in the directory mentioned above. The next time you 
want to send a fax, the new document will show up in the Available
Documents list.
<P>When you are naming the file to save, do not use spaces in the file name.
Put a .ps at the end (period with ps at the end).


<P>
<A NAME="lists">
<H3>Editing Group Lists</H3>
<P>
The outgoing fax lists are stored on the server with the document files. They
are in "Data Directory:fax:config". The format is as follows:
<BR>
<PRE>
name
faxnumber
</PRE>
<BR>
This is repeated as many times as needed. Make sure the list is formatted
exactly this way. The behavior for bad lists is undefined (meaning don't try
it ;-) The name of the file is what shows up in the form to send from.

<H3>Other Information</H3>
<P>
This software was written by David Weis. It required approximately 50 hours
of setup and programming work. Nearly 100 bottles and cans of Mountain Dew
gave their life for this project. It incorporates the cgic library. 
The backend is HylaFAX 4.0 running
on Linux. The hardware is a Gateway 2000 Pentium-133.
