Listing 1. The first step in building a software RAID
device from several AoE drives is setting up AoE.

# setting up the host for AoE

# build and install the AoE driver
tar xvfz aoe-2.6-5.tar.gz
cd aoe-2.6-5
make AOE_PARTITIONS=1 install

# AoE needs no IP addresses!  :)
ifconfig eth1 up

# let the network interface come up
sleep 5

# load the ATA over Ethernet driver
modprobe aoe

# see what aoe disks are available
aoe-stat
