If you want to outsmart the Spanish Inquisition, learn Python. This article
is a practical introduction to writing non-trivial applications in Python.
</i><p>
<i>
by Jacek Artymiak
</i>
<p>
Despite what assembly code and C coders might tell us, high-level
languages do have their place in every programmer's toolbox, and some
of them are much more than a computer-science curiosity. Out of the many
high-level languages we can choose from today, Python seems to be
the most interesting for those who want to learn something new and do real
work at the same time. Its no-nonsense implementation of object-oriented
programming and its clean and easy-to-understand syntax make it a language
that is <I>fun</I> to learn and use, which is not something we can say
about most other languages.
<p>
In this tutorial, you will learn how to write applications that use
command-line options, read and write to pipes, access environment
variables, handle interrupts, read from and write to files, create
temporary files and write to system logs. In other words, you will find
recipes for writing real applications instead of the old boring
<tt>Hello, World!</tt> stuff.
<p>
<H3>Getting Started</H3>
<p>
To begin, if you have not installed the Python interpreter on your system,
now is the time.
To make that step easier, install the latest Python
distribution using packages compatible with your Linux distribution.
rpm, deb and tgz are also available on your Linux CD-ROM
or on-line. If you follow standard installation procedures, you
should not have any problems.
<p>
Next, read the excellent <I>Python Tutorial</I>
written by Guido van Rossum, creator of the Python programming
language. This tutorial is part of the official Python documentation,
and you can find it in either the /usr/doc/python-docs-1.5.2 or
/usr/local/doc/python-docs-1.5.2 catalog. It may be delivered
in the raw LaTeX format, which must be processed first; if you don't know
how to do this, go to <A HREF="http://www.python.org/doc/" TARGET="_blank">http://www.python.org/doc/</A> to download it
in an alternative format.
<p>
I also recommend that you have the <I>Python Library Reference</I>
handy; you might want it when the explanations given here do not meet your
needs. You can find it in the same places as the <I>Python
Tutorial</I>.
<p>
Creating scripts can be done using your favorite text editor
as long as it saves text in plain ASCII format and does not automatically insert 
line breaks
when the line is longer than the width of the editor's window.
<p>
Always begin your scripts with either
<p>
<pre>
#! /usr/local/bin/python
</pre>
or
<p>
<pre>
#! /usr/bin/python
</pre>
If the access path to the <tt>python</tt> binary on your system is
different, change that line, leaving the first two characters (<tt>#!</tt>)
intact. Be sure this line is truly the first line in your
script, not just the first non-blank line--it will save you a lot
of frustration.
<p>
Use <B>chmod</B> to set the file permissions on your script to
make it executable. If the script
is for you alone, type <tt>chmod 0700 <I>scriptfilename</I>.py</tt>;
if you want to share it with others in your group but not let them
edit it, use <tt>0750</tt> as the chmod value; if you want to give
access to everyone else, use the value <tt>0755</tt>. For
help with the chmod command, type <tt>man chmod</tt>.
<p>
<H3>Reading Command-Line Options and Arguments</H3>
<p>
Command-line options and
arguments come in handy when we want to tell our scripts how to behave
or pass some arguments (file names, directory names, user names, etc.) to
them. All programs can read these options and arguments if they want,
and your Python scripts are no different.
<p>
Implementing appropriate handlers boils down to reading the <tt>argv</tt>
list and checking for the options and arguments you want your
script to recognize. There are a few ways to do this. Listing 1 is a simple
option handler that recognizes common -h, -help and
--help options, and when they are found, it exits
immediately after displaying the help message.
<p>
<a href="3946l1.html">Listing 1</a>
<p>
Copy and save this script as help.py, make it executable with the
<tt>chmod&nbsp;0755&nbsp;help.py</tt> command, and run it several times, 
specifying different
options, both recognized by the handler and not; e.g. with one of the options,
you will see this message:
<tt>./help.py&nbsp;-h</tt> or <tt>./help.py&nbsp;-o</tt>. If the option handler does recognize one of the options, you will see this message:
<p>
<pre>
help.py--does nothing useful (yet)
options: -h, -help, or --help--display this help
Copyright (c) Jacek Artymiak, 2000
</pre>
If you invoke <tt>help.py</tt> with an option it does not recognize,
or without any options at all, it will display the ``I don't
recognize this option'' message.
<p>
Note that we need to import the <B>sys</B> module before we can
check the contents of the <tt>argv</tt> list and before we can call
the <B>exit</B> function. The <B>sys.exit</B> statement is a
safety feature which prevents further program execution when one of the
help options is found inside the <tt>argv</tt> list. This ensures
that users don't do something dangerous before reading the help messages
(for which they wouldn't have a need otherwise).
<p>
The simple help option handler described above works quite well and you
can duplicate and change it to recognize additional options, but that is
not the most efficient way to recognize multiple options with or without
arguments. The ``proper'' way to do it is to use the
<B>getopt</B>
module, which converts options and arguments into a nice list of tuples.
Listing 2 shows how it works.
<p>
<a href="3946l2.html">Listing 2</a>
<p>
Copy this script, save it as options.py and make it executable. As you
can see, it uses two
modules: sys and getopt which are imported right
at the beginning. Then we define a simple function that displays the
help message whenever something goes wrong.
<p>
The actual processing of command-line arguments begins with the
<tt>try</tt>
statement, where we are testing the list of command-line options and
arguments (sys.argv) for errors defined as unknown options or
missing arguments; if they are detected, the script will display an error
message and exit immediately (see the <tt>except</tt> statement group).
When no errors have been detected, our script splits the list of options
and their arguments into tuples in the <tt>options</tt> list and
begins parsing them by executing a series of loops, each searching for
one option and its expected arguments.
<p>
The <B>getopt.getopt</B> function generates two lists in our sample
script: <tt>options</tt> which contains options and their arguments;
and <tt>xarguments</tt> which contains arguments not related to any of
the options. We can safely ignore them in most cases.
<p>
To recognize short (one-letter such as <tt>-h</tt>) and long (those prefixed
with <tt>--</tt>) options, getopt.getopt uses two separate
arguments. The list of short options contains all of them listed in
a single string, e.g., <tt>getopt.getopt(sys.argv,&nbsp;'ahoinmdwq')</tt>.
It is possible to specify, in that string, options that absolutely require
an argument to follow them immediately (e.g., <tt>-v<I>filename</I></tt>) or after
a space (e.g., <tt>-v <I>filename</I></tt>). This is done by inserting a colon
(<tt>:</tt>) after the option, like this:
<tt>getopt.getopt(sys.argv,&nbsp;'ahoiv:emwn'</tt>).
However, this creates a silly problem that may
cause some confusion and unnecessarily waste your time; if the user
forgets to specify the argument for the option that requires it, the
option that follows it becomes its argument. Consider this example:
<p>
<pre>
script.py -v -h
</pre>
If you put <tt>v:</tt> in the short option string argument of the
getopt.getopt function, option <tt>-h</tt>
will be treated as the argument of option <tt>-v</tt>. This is
a nuisance and makes parsing
of the list of tuples <I>option, argument</I> much more difficult.
The solution to this problem is simple: don't use the colon, but check
the second item of the tuple that contains the option (first item of
the analyzed tuple) which requires an argument. If it's empty, report
an error, like the <tt>-a</tt> option handler.
<p>
Long options prefixed with <tt>--</tt> must be listed as
a separate argument to the getopt.getopt, e.g.,
<tt>getopt.getopt(sys.argv,&nbsp;'ah',&nbsp;['view',&nbsp;'file='])</tt>. They can be
serviced by the same handler as short options.
<p>
What you do after locating options given by the user is up to you.
Listing 2 can be used as a template for your scripts.
<p>
<H3>Handling Interrupts</H3>
<p>
A properly written application,
especially one that opens files for writing or creates temporary
files, ought to implement interrupt handlers to ensure that no files are
left corrupted or undeleted when the user or the system decides to stop
the execution of our script.
<p>
Signals, like those sent when you press <tt>CTRL-C</tt>
during the
execution of your script, are caught by handlers which may ignore them,
allow default handlers to be executed or perform custom actions.
Python implements some default handlers, but you can override them with
your own code using the <B>signal</B> module.
<p>
<a href="3946l3.html">Listing 3</a>
<p>
The function that lets us trap signals is <B>signal.signal</B>.
Its two arguments are the number of the signal you want to trap and the name
of the signal handler. Listing 3 is a simple script that captures the
SIGINT
(signal numbers have their own symbolic equivalents) signal sent to it
when you press <tt>CTRL-C</tt>.
<p>
The SIGINT signal is not the only one you can capture. If you want to
capture additional signals, add more signal.signal calls to
handle them, changing the signal number (the <tt>signal.SIG<I>xxx</I></tt>
constant) and the name of the handler (optional; you can use
the same handler with more than one signal). To see what signals are
available in Linux, type <tt>kill -l</tt> on the command line.
<p>
<a href="3946l4.html">Listing 4</a>
<p>
Signals can be ignored, which is useful if you want to prevent some
of them from disturbing the execution of your script. Listing 4 shows the
way to do so (be careful;
this script can't be stopped with <tt>CTRL-C</tt>).
<p>
Another signal worth remembering is SIGALRM. Setting up a handler for
that signal allows you to stop the execution of your script after the
given number of seconds. This is done with <B>signal.alarm</B>
as shown in Listing 5.
<p>
<a href="3946l5.html">Listing 5</a>
<p>
<H3>Working with Files</H3>
<p>
<a href="3946l6.html">Listing 6</a>
<p>
Many scripts need to work with files. Remember that before you can read
or write to a file, it must exist and be open. Listing 6 is an example of a
script that opens a file for reading.
Writing to a file requires only a small change (see Listing 7).
<p>
<a href="3946l7.html">Listing 7</a>
<p>
As you can see, the first of the two scripts shown in Listings 6 and 7 fails
to open a file for reading if the file doesn't exist. This is correct
behavior. The second script tries to open
a file for writing: if the file exists, it is truncated (i.e., its contents
are deleted); if it doesn't exist, it is created.
This may not always be the desired behavior. When you want to append
some data at the end of a file, you ought to open it for writing, 
while preserving its original contents. To do that, change the second argument
of the <B>open</B> function from <tt>'w'</tt> to <tt>'a'</tt>.
<p>
Once the file is open, we can read or write to it using these methods:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>	<B>read</B>(<I>n</I>): reads at most <I>n</I> bytes from a file
(if you omit the number of bytes, the entire file will be read), e.g.,
 <tt>fi.read(200)</tt>,
which reads up to 200 bytes.
  <li>	<B>readline</B>: reads one line at
a time, e.g., <tt>fi.readline()</tt>.
  <li>	<B>readlines</B>: reads all lines from a file, e.g.,
<tt>fi.readlines()</tt>.
  <li>	<B>write</B>(<I>string</I>): writes <I>string</I> to a file, e.g., <tt>fo.write('alabama')</tt>.
  <li>	<B>writelines(<I>list</I>)</B>: writes a <I>list</I> of strings to
a file, e.g., <tt>fo.writelines(['alaska', 'california', 'nevada'])</tt>
</ul>
When you want to close a file, use its <B>close</B> method,
e.g., <tt>fo.close()</tt>.
<p>
<a href="3946l8.html">Listing 8</a>
<p>
If you want your script to create temporary files, use the
<B>tempfile</B> module. It simplifies the task of creating temporary
files by automatically creating unique file names based on templates
defined in variables <tt>tempdir</tt> and <tt>template</tt>. It doesn't
create or delete temporary files itself, but you can accomplish this using
a method similar to the one used in Listing 8.
<p>
Note that you need to use both the <tt>os.O_CREAT</tt> and
<tt>os.RDWR</tt> flags to tell the <B>os.open</B> function to create
a temporary file for both reading and writing.	Also, remember to close
and remove all temporary files created before exiting a script.
You will find more information on the functions, constants and
variables used in that example in the os, posix and
tempfile sections of the <I>Python Library Reference Manual</I>.
<p>
<a href="3946l9.html">Listing 9</a>
<p>
It is a good idea to implement a single handler that will remove temporary
files before exiting from the script, as in Listing 9.
<p>
<H3>Working with Pipes</H3>
<p>
Many command-line tools let
us create pipes for processing data, and it is a good idea to consider
implementing this functionality in your own scripts. Pipes allow us
to read from the standard input and write to the standard output of our
script, as well as read from the standard output and write to the standard
input of other commands.
<p>
Everything we need to implement pipes in our scripts is stored in the
<B>os</B> and <B>sys</B> modules. Let's teach our script to read
data from its own standard input (represented by <tt>sys.stdin</tt>)
and copy it, unchanged, to its own standard output (<tt>sys.stdout</tt>):
<p>
<pre>
#! /usr/local/bin/python
import sys
sys.stdout.write(sys.stdin.read())
</pre>
This works well, but doesn't allow us to modify the data appearing on
the script's standard input. This can be achieved in several ways,
depending on how much data you want to process at one time. Listing 10
reads one line at a time and inserts <tt>#</tt> at
the beginning of each line.
<p>
<a href="3946l10.html">Listing 10</a>
<p>
If you use the read(<I>n</I>) method instead of readline,
you can set the number of bytes to be read from the standard
input. Listing 11 reads 256 bytes at a time.
<p>
<a href="3946l11.html">Listing 11</a>
<p>
A slightly different approach is needed when you want to read the whole
file at one go. We use the <B>sub</B> function from the
<B>re</B> module to perform a simple substitution. See Listing 12.
<p>
<a href="3946l12.html">Listing 12</a>
<p>
That's about all the basic knowledge needed to work with the
standard input and output of our script. However, Python can read
the standard output of external pipes or write to their standard input.
This time, we'll need to use the <B>os</B> module and
its <B>popen</B> function.
<p>
Listing 13 writes to the standard input of the pipe
<tt>sed&nbsp;'s/-/+/g' &gt;&nbsp;output</tt>
one hundred lines of text, each containing the <tt>-</tt> string.
The data passed to the pipe is then processed by <B>sed</B>
and ends up as one hundred lines with <tt>+++</tt>.
You can read from a pipe, too. Listing 14 shows you how.
<p>
<a href="3946l13.html">Listing 13</a>
<p>
<a href="3946l14.html">Listing 14</a>
<p>
<H3>Writing to the System Log</H3>
<p>
<a href="3946l15.html">Listing 15</a>
<p>
If you develop
applications that you want to keep an eye on and leave a trace of their
activity in the system log in a way similar to many daemons running on a
typical Linux system, you can do so with the <B>syslog</B> function
located in the <B>syslog</B> module. To enable
writing to system logs, import the syslog module and add calls
to the <B>syslog.syslog</B> function at those points needing to
be documented in the system log. See Listing 15 for an example.
<p>
<a href="3946l16.html">Listing 16</a>
<p>
To see the output from your script, open another X terminal window or
switch to another console and type
<p>
<pre>
tail -f /var/log/messages
</pre>
to reveal what your script has just been doing. The output looks
like Listing 16.
<p>
Remember that if you send the same message to the system log several
times in a row, it will be buffered until a different one arrives in
the system log buffer. It will appear there only once, and the next
line in the
system log will indicate how many times it was repeated. This bit of
code,
<p>
<pre>
#! /usr/local/bin/python
import syslog
# some code
for a in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
	syslog.syslog('Hello from Python!')
</pre>
will generate the following results:
<p>
<pre>
Jan  20 00:04:33 localhost python: Hello from Python! Jan  20 00:04:49
localhost last message repeated 2 times
</pre>
Don't treat the system log like a trash can where you can send any kind
of garbage; write only the most important information to it.
<p>
<H3>Reading Environment Variables</H3>
<p>
Some scripts may need to access information stored in one or more environment
variables. Their values at the time your script is executed are
stored in the os.environ dictionary, available after you import
the os module. Here is the script that prints out all the
environment variables set at the time your script executed.
<p>
<pre>
#! /usr/local/bin/python
import os
for a in os.environ.keys():
	print a, ' = ', os.environ.[a]
</pre>
If you are interested in checking for a particular value and using it
in your own script, use this bit of code to get you started.
<p>
<pre>
#! /usr/local/bin/python
import os
if os.environ['USER']:
	print 'Hello, '+os.environ['USER']
</pre>
<a href="3946l17.html">Listing 17</a>
<p>
If you want to modify the value of a particular environment
variable while your script is running, use Listing 17 as a guide.
<p>
<H3>What Next?</H3>
<p>
Now you know enough to write some well-behaved
scripts that look and work like many other Linux commands. I encourage
you to read the <I>Python Library Reference</I> and see what is possible
using only the basic Python distribution. If the standard Python
library is not enough for you, a visit to the official Python web site
will reveal a wealth of possibilities and bags of useful code which you
can use to learn and solve your programming problems.
