Listing 3. Proxy ARP

# Bridging only works with Ethernet, so I have
# to do something else to get the same effect with PLIP. 
# Fortunately, there's proxyarp! I'll just tell eth1 to tell the world that it is
# acting on behalf of the
# machine on the other end of the PLIP connection, 
# and it should work fine
[ $KVERSION = "2.2" ] && {
# 2.2 requires me to explicitly enable this feature
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/proxy_arp
}
arp -i eth1 -s egg eth1 pub
