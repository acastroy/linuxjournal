In order to build the sample, you must first edit the Makefile, and change
line 5 so that the variable top_srcdir points to your omniORB 2.5.0
installation.

Then, you must edit Make.rules, and make sure the IDL variable is set
correctly for your installation of omniORB.  Pay special attention to
whether the path contains i586_linux_2.0 or i586_linux_2.0_egcs, etc.
