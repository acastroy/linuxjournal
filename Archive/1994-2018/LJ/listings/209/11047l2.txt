Listing 2. The GAUGER macro makes it easy to
integrate Gauger with C code. Note that the code does not need to be linked
against any additional libraries (other than libc).

#include <gauger.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
  time_t start = time (NULL);
  do_test ();
  time_t delay = time (NULL) - start;
  GAUGER ("subsystem", "execution time for f",
          delay, "s");
  return 0;
}
