; This instrument shows how the moscil opcode can 
; be used for a sort of
; "indeterminancy" aspect in composition. knum and 
; kvel control the output
; of MIDI notes and their velocities over p3 
; (note-stream duration as specified
; in the score). kran output is used for kdur 
; (actual duration) and kpause
; (pause between notes).
;
; The moscil (MIDI oscillator) opcode permits 
; control of MIDI channel, note-number, 
; velocity, duration, and time between notes.
