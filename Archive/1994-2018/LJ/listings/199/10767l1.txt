# Some variables you need to set:
amilost="http://example.net/my-n900-is-lost.txt" # CHANGE THIS!

username="username"       # the username at your ssh host
sshhost="hostname"
backupnumber="3215551212" # backup phone that can receive SMS messages

# A timestamp variable you can alter if you want to:
timestamp=$(/bin/date +%Y-%m-%d-%H.%M.%S-%Z)

# With the vars out of the way, we can begin:

# The first step is to check for the file on the webserver.
# If it exists, we collect data and send it,
# if not, we print a message and exit.
if wget --output-document=/tmp/${timestamp}.txt \
        ${amilost} 2>/dev/null;  then
  # If we're here, the file exists and the phone is lost.
  # Get the current IP address and send it using the
  # sendsms.py script:
  /sbin/ifconfig -a \
      | awk '/inet addr/ { print $2 }' \
      | awk -F: '{ print $2 }' \
           > /tmp/${timestamp}.ip

  # sendsms.py from:
  # http://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=558430&postcount=57

                        "$(/bin/cat /tmp/${timestamp}.ip)"

  # take a picture with the front-facing camera

  # More things can be done.
  # See http://wiki.maemo.org/Phone_control for
  # ideas. Experiment and have fun!
  # (But don't blame me if you accidentally brick your phone.)

  # We've gathered the data we want, now copy everything to the sshhost
  # server
  # (need to have ssh-keys set up for this to work).
  /usr/bin/scp -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa /tmp/${timestamp}.* \

  # What if I want to run more commands than are listed above,
  # such as making the phone vibrate or having it call me?
  # The file I downloaded from the server can contain special
  # commands. If the file is empty, nothing will happen.
  # This probably is not the most secure thing to do, but if the
  # phone really has been stolen, this will allow you to pull
  # data off of it and/or brick the phone on purpose. Be careful!
  # Only uncomment the following line if you know what you are doing
  # and are comfortable with the consequences. I am not responsible
  # if you break your phone.

  #/bin/sh /tmp/${timestamp}.txt

else
  # if the file on the server doesn't exist the phone is not lost:
  echo "I am not lost."
fi
# That's it! We're done.
