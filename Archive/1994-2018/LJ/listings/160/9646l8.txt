Listing 8. Making the initial passwd file with htpasswd. The -c option
creates the passwd file if it doesn't exist or replaces it if it
does. Use the -c only once. Make sure your umask is set first, as some
distributions have lax defaults.

umask 0027
htpasswd -b -c   passwd ben     your-password-here
htpasswd -b      passwd chidori her-password-here
