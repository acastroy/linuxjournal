# Set the GDT size to its maximum value 8192

# entries reserved for each CPU and reserve all
# other entries for processes, as original
# system does.

CPU1: SHARED_TSS_ENTRY + 1 = 14

CPUn: SHARED_TSS_ENTRY + n = SHARED_TSS_ENTRY + n

# Change NR_TASKS from a macro to a variable, and
# doing this in system initialize function
# start_kernel():
Task = kmalloc(sizeof(void *) * NR_TASKS, GFP_ATOMIC);
# This will dynamically allocate the process
# list array.
# Modify the parse_options function to accept an
# extra parameter nrtasks, which indicates the
# maximum concurrent process number. This will
# enable the user to dynamically set maximum
# process number.
