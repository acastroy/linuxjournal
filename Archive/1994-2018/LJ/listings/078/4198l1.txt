version " [message to display in lieu of BIND's
version number]";
# There's no legitimate reason for anyone but network admin.s to know your
# BIND version - number. Some people use this
# parameter to respond to version-
# queries with bogus or humorous information.

recursion [yes | no];
#Turn recursion on or off globally. If off, set
# fetch - glue to "no" also (see below)

fetch - glue [yes | no];
#Related to recursion: glue records are RRs
# necessary for other RRs to make sense
#(e.g., any name pointed to by a "CNAME" record
# must have an "A" record somewhere)
#Normally glue records can be fetched in the
#course of normal queries, unless you disable
# it here.
