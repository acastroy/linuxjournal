Grameen Foundation's Mifos</h2></div></div><p>
Open source is being used to battle against global poverty. One excellent
example is the Grameen Foundation's Mifos, an application for nonprofits
to manage microfinance operations efficiently. Microfinance is a form
of economic development whereby poor people, typically in developing
countries, receive small loans to start small enterprises and get out
of poverty. You may recall that Grameen's director, Dr Muhammad
Yunus, won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his microfinance work in
Bangladesh. Although Grameen created Mifos, it has generously made
the software available to everyone and is leveraging the open-source
model industry-wide. Although Mifos has been around for a year, the latest
news is that IBM will apply its expertise in finance and open source to
improve the application.

Wolfram Research's Interactive Mathematica</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux-friendly Wolfram Research has taken a page from Adobe
Acrobat's playbook by creating the new and free Mathematica Player
runtime application, which is available now for download on Linux,
Windows and Mac OS platforms. People with a licensed copy of Mathematica
6 can upload their Mathematica notebook files for processing to the new
Publish for Player Web service, after which the notebook files will run
in the Player. The end result is that you do not need a full version
of Mathematica just to view documents as in the past. Also in the
pipeline is the non-gratis Mathematica Player Pro for viewing interactive
Mathematica documents and other functionality.

Talend's Open Studio</h2></div></div><p>
Talend has two new developments this month: its Open Studio open-source
data-integration application was upgraded to version 2.2; and it released
the Activity Monitoring Console/Personal Edition. First, Open Studio Version
2.2, which has more than 150 connectors available, now offers a number of new
specialized connectors, as well as event-based action triggering and
SOA functionality that enables exposure of data-integration processes
as Web services. Furthermore, Open Studio takes advantage of recent
improvements in Eclipse v3.3. Second, Monitoring Console/Personal
Edition is a new centralized tool for monitoring the distributed execution
of all data-integration jobs. It provides notifications upon failure
or error as well as the ability to analyze statistics and trends and
detect potential execution bottlenecks before they occur.

CorraTech's OPENSUITE</h2></div></div><p>
In other integration news, CorraTech announced OPENSUITE, a
Java-based, open-source application that will enable business process
and data integration across a range of open-source applications.
OPENSUITE is currently in pre-beta. The aim is to integrate CRM,
ERP, content/document management, messaging and project management.
Organizations can implement cross-application business processes, preserve
intrasession context while working with multiple applications, create
single sign-on access for multiple applications and reduce redundancy
introduced by the complexity of integration across applications.
Using an SOA approach and supplying middleware layer functionality,
OPENSUITE is distributed with a number of packaged business processes,
called Business Process Packs. The first Pack will support CentricCRM,
KnowledgeTree, Openbravo and Zimbra.

Nuxeo's Enterprise Platform</h2></div></div><p>
The world of enterprise content management (ECM) has gotten more
interesting with veteran Nuxeo's recent release of its Enterprise Platform
5.1 ECM application. Nuxeo says that this release is &ldquo;distinguished by
its service-oriented architecture (SOA), scalability and
flexibility.&rdquo;
The firm touts its infrastructure being built on plugins and extension
points that are based on the OSGi standard, giving developers and
integrators the ability to create custom configurations
and extensions quickly and easily. New features in 5.1 include an advanced search service
based on the NXQL query language (SQL-based), data import/export service,
enhanced horizontal scalability and electronic and physical records
management.

Wrox's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional SlickEdit</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning
Linux Programming</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
Wrox had a couple of particularly interesting November releases, such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional SlickEdit</em></span> by John Hurst and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Linux Programming</em></span>, 4th
edition, by Neil Matthew and Richard Stones. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional
SlickEdit</em></span>,
likely the first guide dedicated to the SlickEdit tools, is an
example-heavy, hands-on guide to getting the most out of this popular
development environment. The CD-ROM offers an exclusive extended trial
version of SlickEdit. Meanwhile, in its 4th debut, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Beginning Linux
Programming</em></span> takes a similar, learn-by-doing approach to teaching UNIX
programming and application development in C on the Linux platform.
The book also introduces toolkits and libraries for working with UIs of
all sorts. Advanced topics include processes socket programming, MySQL,
writing apps for GNOME/KDE desktop, writing device drivers, POSIX threads
and kernel programming. Wrox also offers <span   class="emphasis"><em>Professional Linux
Programming</em></span>,
a recent book for more-advanced developers.
