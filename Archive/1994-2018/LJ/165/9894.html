The perfect NAC solution for both wired and wireless networks.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b94580.0x1c8c500"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In our initial PacketFence article in the April 2007 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, we introduced the great network
access control (NAC) solution that rivals the best ones on the market. On
that occasion, we covered ARP-based isolation, which works relatively
well for small networks.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, ARP-based isolation can't really scale to many thousands
of nodes and is relatively easy to bypass with a simple static ARP
table. Thus, we, at Inverse, decided to improve PacketFence by
adding a VLAN-based isolation mode. This addition, combined with other
enhancements, makes the solution suitable for large-scale networks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b94580.0x1c8c768"></a>
Introduction to VLAN Isolation</h2></div></div><p>
The purpose of PacketFence's VLAN isolation is to assign any device connected
to the network to an appropriate VLAN based on its MAC, registration and
violation status. A simple scenario would be that every new device belongs
to a registration VLAN, a registered and violation-free device belongs to a
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; VLAN and a device with open violations belongs to an isolation
VLAN. If the isolation and registration VLANs are not routed to the
&ldquo;normal&rdquo;
VLAN, PacketFence fully isolates the new device, and any device that violates
network policy, from the regular network, efficiently preventing any
attack or virus propagation. Of course, real networks are a bit more
complicated, and VoIP phones may not end up in the same VLAN as regular
computers or servers. But, whatever your network's VLAN design, PacketFence is
up to the task.
</p><p>
In order for the VLAN isolation code to work properly, you must use
manageable switches. In particular, the switches must provide a means to
change a port's VLAN remotely and must be able to send SNMP (Simple Network
Management Protocol) traps to PacketFence. SNMP traps include the switch's IP
address; the port number and, depending on the trap type, could include the
port status (for example, &ldquo;up&rdquo; when a device has
been connected and &ldquo;down&rdquo; when
disconnected); the MAC address of the device (mostly for MAC notification
and security violation traps); the number of MACs connected to the switch port
and so on. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9894f1.large.jpg"><img src="9894f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. PacketFence's Handling of SNMP Traps
</p></div></div><p>
When a switch sends an SNMP trap to PacketFence, the snmptrapd d&aelig;mon
receives it and writes it to the log file 
/usr/local/pf/contrib/log/snmptrapd.log. PacketFence's setVlanOnTrapd
d&aelig;mon continuously reads this log file and, for every new trap,
determines whether
it needs to change a port's VLAN. If this is the case, it sends the appropriate
SNMP commands to the switch.
</p><p>
A crucial part of VLAN isolation is knowing when a device connects to
or disconnects from the network. In early 2006, we started the development of
the VLAN isolation code by supporting two very basic SNMP traps: linkup and
linkdown traps. The vast majority of switch vendors support these two
traps,
which made our implementation immediately usable on a wide variety of
networking hardware. Unfortunately, simply relying on linkup and linkdown
traps has its downsides, from both a performance and a functional
perspective, including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Because a switch needs to see some network traffic on a port to determine
the MAC address of the connecting device, linkup traps cannot include
any MAC address. PacketFence's setVlanOnTrapd must, therefore, 
repeatedly query the switch after every linkup trap in order to determine the MAC
address of the newly connected device, which introduces some overhead.
</p></li><li><p>
Most VoIP phones contain a built-in switch to connect a PC. The switch
sends the linkup trap when you connect the phone; when you connect the
PC to the phone, the switch won't send a second linkup trap. Therefore,
in this deployment scenario, relying solely on linkup and linkdown
traps does not provide enough information to setVlanOnTrapd to work
correctly.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
One possible solution to address these issues is MAC notification traps.
Every time a switch learns a MAC address on a port, it sends a &ldquo;MAC
learned&rdquo;
trap that includes the MAC address. And, of course, PacketFence now also
supports MAC notification traps.
</p><p>
In addition to assigning an appropriate VLAN to devices when they connect to
the network, PacketFence also isolates devices already connected to the network
when they violate the network policy. Two different options are available:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
PacketFence can briefly disconnect a device from the network by
administratively shutting down the switch port and re-opening it soon
after. In this case, the switch sends a linkdown, followed by a linkup
trap. When PacketFence receives the linkup trap, it determines that the
device has an open violation and switches the port to the isolation VLAN.
On the computer side, the network adapter notices that the network link
went down and automatically renews its IP address&mdash;this time in the isolation VLAN. PacketFence's captive portal then informs the user that he or
she has
been isolated.
</p></li><li><p>
Administratively shutting down a switch port can be problematic when using
VoIP phones, as doing so might end a call. If PacketFence has access to the
isolation VLAN, you don't actually need to shut down the port. Changing
the port's VLAN and doing some ARP spoofing generally are sufficient to
make the captive portal available to the user.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
So far, we've mentioned only the registration and isolation VLANs, but PacketFence
uses a third VLAN, the MAC detection VLAN. This VLAN, which is the default one
of every port, must not contain access to any DHCP server and could be seen as
an &ldquo;empty&rdquo; VLAN. It exists to allow the switch to learn the MAC address of a
newly connected device before it obtains an answer from a DHCP server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b94580.0x1c8d268"></a>
Example Installation</h2></div></div><p>
Install PacketFence 1.7 from <a href="http://www.packetfence.org" target="_self">www.packetfence.org</a>. If you are using
Red Hat EL5 or CentOS5, the easiest way to do so is to install the official RPM.
</p><p>
In this example, we set up VLAN isolation on a Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch (IP
address 192.168.0.3). The PacketFence server's IP address is 192.168.0.10.
Let's further assume that you are using the following VLANs and that these
already have
been created on your switch:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; VLAN
</p></li><li><p>
isolation VLAN
</p></li><li><p>
registration VLAN
</p></li><li><p>
MAC detection VLAN
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Enable the SNMP traps globally on the switch with the following commands:


<pre     class="programlisting">
snmp-server enable traps snmp authentication linkdown linkup
snmp-server enable traps mac-notification
snmp-server host 192.168.0.10 version 2c public mac-notification snmp
mac-address-table notification interval 0
mac-address-table notification
mac-address-table aging-time 300
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, configure every access port PacketFence should be handling with the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
switchport access vlan 4
switchport mode access
snmp trap mac-notification added
spanning-tree portfast
</pre>
</p><p>
Edit the VLAN isolation configuration file
/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf, so
that it contains the correct SNMP community strings. Then, adjust the VLAN
definition as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
vlans = 1,2,3,4
normalVlan = 1
isolationVlan = 2
registrationVlan = 3
macDetectionVlan = 4
</pre>
</p><p>
And, finally, add a new section for your switch:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[192.168.0.3]
ip = 192.168.0.3
type = Cisco::Catalyst_2960
mode = production
uplink = 23,24
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you can do a communication test between PacketFence and the switch:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/pf/bin/pfcmd_vlan -getVlan -switch 192.168.0.3 -ifIndex 10001
</pre>
</p><p>
The next test is to determine whether the switch can send SNMP traps to PacketFence.
Start snmptrapd:

<pre     class="programlisting">
service snmptrapd start
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b94580.0x1c8dc60"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and observe the log file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f /usr/local/pf/logs/snmptrapd.log
</pre>
</p><p>
Every time a device connects to and disconnects from the network, you
should see a new line in the log file.
</p><p>
Now, configure PacketFence's access to VLAN 1, 2 and 3. Set the 
configuration of the switch port that PacketFence plugs into to
&ldquo;trunk mode&rdquo;,
and allow packets in VLAN 1 to pass through the switch without tagging. On the 
PacketFence server, add two new NICs that read and write 802.1q tagged packets
for VLAN 2 and 3. Don't forget to add these new NICs to your configuration file
/usr/local/pf/conf/pf.conf.
</p><p>
To simplify the installation, configure a DHCP service on the PacketFence box
for VLANs 2 and 3. The DHCP server should return its own (VLAN-specific) IP
address as both the gateway and the DNS server. Last but not least, set up a
&ldquo;fake&rdquo; DNS service for VLANs 2 and 3 that responds to all queries with its own
IP address. Now, verify that a host connected to the registration VLAN is able
to obtain an IP address and that whatever DNS query it sends, PacketFence
answers with its own IP.
</p><p>
If all these tests work fine, you can start setVlanOnTrapd:

<pre     class="programlisting">
service setVlanOnTrapd start
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b94580.0x2086278"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and look at the log file to verify that your devices, upon connection to the
switch, are assigned to the correct VLAN:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tail -f /usr/local/pf/logs/setvlanontrapd.log
</pre>
</p><p>
This setup should be transparent for already-registered devices, because they end 
up in the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; VLAN; unregistered devices will be assigned to the
registration VLAN where all they can access is the PacketFence server that
will show the captive portal with the registration screen.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b94580.0x2086488"></a>
Introduction to Isolation in Wireless Networks</h2></div></div><p>
PacketFence also integrates very well with wireless networks. As for its wired
counterpart, the switch, a wireless Access Point (AP) needs to implement some
specific features in order for the integration to work perfectly. In
particular, the AP needs to support the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Several SSIDs with several VLANs inside each SSID.
</p></li><li><p>
Authentication against a RADIUS server.
</p></li><li><p>
Dynamic VLAN assignment (through RADIUS attributes).
</p></li><li><p>
SNMP deauthentication traps.
</p></li><li><p>
The deauthentication of an associated station.
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9894f2.large.jpg"><img src="9894f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. How PacketFence Integrates with Wireless Networks
</p></div></div><p>
We then can configure two SSIDs on the AP, the first one reserved for visitors
and unregistered clients. In this SSID, communications will not be
encrypted,
and users will connect either to the registration VLAN or the visitor's VLAN
(depending on their registration status). The second SSID will allow encrypted
communications for registered users. The VLANs here are the
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; VLAN and
the isolation VLAN (if ever there are open violations for the MAC).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b94580.0x2086bc0"></a>
Example Installation</h2></div></div><p>
In this example, we configure a Cisco 1242 AP (IP address 192.168.0.4).
Configuration of other vendors' APs is similar. First, define the normal,
isolation, registration and visitor VLANs on the AP, together with the
appropriate wired and wireless interfaces as shown for the isolation VLAN:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dot11 vlan-name isolation vlan 2

interface FastEthernet0.2
 encapsulation dot1Q 2
 no ip route-cache
 bridge-group 253
 no bridge-group 253 source-learning
 bridge-group 253 spanning-disabled

interface Dot11Radio0.2
 encapsulation dot1Q 2
 no ip route-cache
 bridge-group 253
 bridge-group 253 subscriber-loop-control
 bridge-group 253 block-unknown-source
 no bridge-group 253 source-learning
 no bridge-group 253 unicast-flooding
 bridge-group 253 spanning-disabled
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, create the two SSIDs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dot11 ssid WPA2
   vlan 2 backup normal
   authentication open eap eap_methods
   authentication key-management wpa
   accounting acct-methods
   mbssid guest-mode

dot11 ssid MACauth
   vlan 3 backup visitor
   authentication open mac-address mac_methods
   accounting acct_methods
   mbssid guest-mode
</pre>
</p><p>
Configure the RADIUS server (we assume here that the FreeRADIUS server and
the PacketFence server are located on the same box):

<pre     class="programlisting">
radius-server host 192.168.0.10 auth-port 1812 
 &#8618;acct-port 1813 key secretKey

aaa group server radius rad_eap
 server 192.168.0.10 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813
aaa authentication login eap_methods group rad_eap

aaa group server radius rad_mac
 server 192.168.0.10 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813
aaa authentication login mac_methods group rad_mac
</pre>
</p><p>
Enable the SNMP deauthentication traps:

<pre     class="programlisting">
snmp-server enable traps deauthenticate
snmp-server host 192.168.0.10 public deauthenticate
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, activate the SSIDs on the radio:

<pre     class="programlisting">
interface Dot11Radio0
 encryption vlan 1 mode ciphers aes-ccm
 encryption vlan 2 mode ciphers aes-ccm
 ssid WPA2
 ssid MACauth
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, check with a Wi-Fi card that you actually can see the two new SSIDs. You
can't connect to them yet because the RADIUS server is not up and running.
</p><p>
Start configuring the FreeRADIUS server by adding the following lines at the
end of /etc/raddb/clients.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
client 192.168.0.3 {
  secret = secretKey
  shortname = AP1242
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In /etc/raddb/eap.conf, set the default eap type to peap at the beginning of
the eap {} section:

<pre     class="programlisting">
default_eap_type = peap
</pre>
</p><p>
And, set up your cryptographic keys in the tls {} section.
</p><p>
Then, update /etc/raddb/radiusd.conf, first by adding the following lines to the
modules {} section:

<pre     class="programlisting">
perl {
    module = ${confdir}/rlm_perl_packetfence.pl
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, add &ldquo;perl&rdquo; at the end of the authorize {} section. The script
/etc/raddb/rlm_perl_packetfence.pl uses the Calling-Station-Id RADIUS request
attribute, containing the MAC of the wireless station to determine its
registration and violation status. Based on this information, it sets the
Tunnel-Medium-Type, Tunnel-Type and Tunnel-Private-Group-ID RADIUS reply
attributes. The AP, upon reception of these three attributes, then confines
the wireless station into the specified VLAN.
</p><p>
The last file to edit is /etc/raddb/users to define that non-EAP messages
should, by default, lead to an authentication acceptance:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DEFAULT EAP-Message !* "", Auth-Type := Accept
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, add a local test user with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
testUser User-Password == "testPwd"
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, start FreeRADIUS in debug mode:

<pre     class="programlisting">
radiusd -x
</pre>
</p><p>
Try to connect to one of the two new SSIDs with your Wi-Fi card, and you'll see
the packets received by FreeRADIUS with the generated responses.
</p><p>
It also is noteworthy that the concepts you've learned here on using
PacketFence with wireless networks are identical to using 802.1x on a wired
network, which of course, is supported by PacketFence.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b94580.0x2087610"></a>
Extending to New Switches and APs</h2></div></div><p>
We designed the VLAN isolation feature from the beginning with extensibility in
mind. All supported switches are represented through Perl objects, and we make
extensive use of inheritance. For example:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
At the highest level, you have the pf::SNMP object that defines general
functions, such as SNMP session creation and deletion, database connections
and some standardized SNMP queries. 
</p></li><li><p>
At the next level are the vendor-specific objects, such as pf::SNMP::Cisco
and pf::SNMP::Nortel. They include the necessary functions to parse SNMP
traps and, most of the time, to read and write a port's VLAN assignment. 
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, at the lowest level, are the model-specific objects,
containing only the model-specific code.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This architecture simplifies adding the support for a new product from an
already-supported vendor; it comes down to redefining only a very limited
number of methods and can be done in a matter of hours.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b94580.0x20879d8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
As you've seen in this article, PacketFence secures both wired and wireless
networks in an efficient way. Offering the same level of security and using the
same NAC solution on both networks make PacketFence one of the most essential
security tools to have.
