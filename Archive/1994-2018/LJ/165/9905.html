Explore hidden secrets of the DNS hierarchy with a 
benign and
systematic diagnostic and audit methodology using readily available
tools.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f7580.0x28ef298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Our DNS is working. Our clients can access our Web site, our secure
e-commerce service, our FTP servers and our LDAP services. Our people can
e-mail and browse the Web, and our VoIP system is fully functional. In
short,
all the services that, without a functional DNS, would not be working,
appear to be fully operational. All is well with our DNS&mdash;perhaps.
</p><p>
When researching for my first book, I was constantly surprised, and on
more than one occasion stunned, at how often even large, technically
proficient organizations had potentially dangerous flaws in their DNS
infrastructure. This article describes a simple set of techniques using
two readily available tools, dig and fpdns (see Obtaining
Tools sidebar), to explore the DNS hierarchy methodically. The techniques used
are benign; they essentially emulate the functions of a caching
resolver and can be used both for diagnostic and auditing purposes.
There are tools available that cover some of the techniques shown here,
but it is vital that administrators understand the entire process to
avoid any shortcomings in the tools. 
</p><p>
Although this article uses the
inevitable example.com and private IP addresses in the interest of being
a good Netizen, I encourage you to pull up a shell and substitute your
domain, one that interests you, is important to you or about which you
are just plain curious. The diagnostic examples show BIND because it
represents approximately 80% of the estimated nine million name servers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f7580.0x28ef500"></a>
Scope the Target</h2></div></div><p>
To animate the techniques, let's simply look up the IP
address(es) of the Web site or sites of our target domain example.com.
First, using a browser, go to the site and navigate
around, taking interesting links, especially the secure ones. Our
objective is to build a list of all the host and domain names being
used by our target. In our illustrative case, say we discover that our target
uses www.example.com as its public portal and a second host,
online.example.com, for secure (HTTPS) transactions. From here on, we
simply emulate the behavior a caching DNS would use to find its way to
the target Web sites with a few deviations thrown in to spice up the
action.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27f7580.0x28ef608"></a>
The Root of All</h2></div></div><p>
The principal job of a caching name server is to resolve a domain name,
such as www.example.com, into an IP address. If it has no information
about the domain name in its cache, it must track the delegation route
starting from the root servers through the DNS name hierarchy to the
authoritative name server for the target domain. A delegation is defined
by two or more Name Server (NS) Resource Records (RRs) in a parent
zone. The NS RRs at the parent zone point to the authoritative name server of
the child zone. This parent-child process is repeated for each level in
the name hierarchy until we reach our target. Thus, for www.example.com,
we will obtain a delegation from the root to .com's authoritative name
servers, and then a delegation from .com to example.com's authoritative name
servers.
</p><p>
A caching server gets its initial list of root servers from the root or
hints zone, which uses a zone file typically called named.ca or
named.root. To get the names of the root servers being used by your
local DNS (defined in /etc/resolv.conf), simply enter:
<tt  >dig</tt>.
</p><p>
You should get a response that looks something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

I've removed a lot of material above, indicated by the ... sequence in the
interests of brevity.
</p><p>
The format of a dig response has five
sections. The HEADER contains summary and status information, which we
look at in more detail later. The next four sections contain information in
standard Resource Record (RR) format as they may appear in a zone file.
The QUESTION SECTION reflects the question or query received by the
responding server. In the above case, the dig command was interpreted to
be &ldquo;get me the NS RRs for the root&rdquo;. The ANSWER SECTION may be empty if
our question was not answered or may contain one or more RRs, which are
the answer to our query. In the example above, it contains the NS RRs for
the root servers (a.root-servers.net to m.root-servers.net). Note
especially the infamous dot on the left hand side of each result line in
this section, which is the short form for the root. The AUTHORITY
SECTION normally contains one or more NS RRs for servers that are
authoritative for the domain in question. In the above case, it is not
present simply because the ANSWER SECTION already contains this
information. The ADDITIONAL SECTION contains any information the
responding server thinks may be useful and has available. In this example,
and in most cases, it contains the A (Address) RRs of the
authoritative name servers that our local name server has used.
</p><p>
The really interesting stuff is in the
HEADER. The first thing to check
is the status. In this case, NOERR means the command was successful (see
the Dig Header Values sidebar for a complete list). The flags in
this case are qr, indicating we received a query response that seems
pretty reasonable; rd, indicating our dig message requested
recursive services; and ra, signifying that this server
supports recursive service (again, see the Dig Header Values sidebar for a complete
list of possible flags). The HEADER also contains the id,
which uniquely identifies this request/response pair and finally
summarizes how many RRs we have in each section.
</p><p>
The last few lines of the dig response yield useful performance
information. The SERVER line particularly confirms the address and name
of the server from which the results were obtained.
</p><p>
Now, our toolkit is in place, and we have some idea about what it is
telling us.
So, next, let's follow the DNS hierarchy from the root to our
targets www.example.com and online.example.com.
</p><p>
The first command on our journey is:


<pre     class="programlisting">
dig @a.root-servers.net www,example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
This command uses one of the root servers (a.root-servers.net) to get
the A RR of www.example.com. A purist would say that to avoid possible
sources of corruption, we always should use @x.x.x.x (an IP address)
rather than a name, especially in a diagnostic mode, and in general, this
method is safer. However, names are more understandable (the reason for
the DNS), and we always can check that the IP address on the SERVER line
of the response is in the expected set. The dig response will look like
this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.4.1-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; dig @a.root-servers.net www,example.com

...

;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 15570

</pre>
</p><p>
Again, I've removed a lot of material indicated by the ... sequence in
the interest of brevity. The first thing to note in the header is that
the ra flag is not set, meaning recursion is not available&mdash;normal in
the root and TLD servers. Second, the aa flag is not
set, which means this is not an authoritative response. At first, this
may seem strange; this is, after all, a root server. The root is the
parent of .com (the next name in the hierarchy), but a parent's NS RRs
(the point of delegation) are never authoritative; only the child can
give an authoritative response for its NS RRs. This has important
implications as we will see later. In summary, we have no answer
(ANSWER 0) and no error (status NOERR), but there are AUTHORITY (13)
entries. This identifies the response as a referral. The root cannot
supply the answer but has helpfully referred us to the next level in the
hierarchy&mdash;in this case, the .com gTLD servers, whose names are given in
the AUTHORITY SECTION and some IP addresses in the ADDITIONAL SECTION,
including an IPv6 address, which is becoming increasingly common.
</p><p>
Continuing our journey, we issue:


<pre     class="programlisting">
dig @a.gtld-servers.net www.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
This command says, using one of the .com gTLD servers
(a.gtld-servers.net), get me the IP address of www.example.com. This may
begin to look a little tedious. After all, the root and gTLD servers are
operated by professional organizations, so why bother checking them?
Consider, however, that we may not be using the real root and gTLD
servers. We obtained our list from our local caching server. If its
hints zone is poisoned, this process will help us identify deviations
from normality, and besides, some of the ccTLD zones have
really interesting structures. The golden rule is make no assumptions.
The dig response will look something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.4.1-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @a.gtld-servers.net www.example.com

...

;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 20018

;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 2, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available


;; QUESTION SECTION:

;www.example.com. IN A


;; AUTHORITY SECTION:

example.com. 86400 IN NS ns2.example.com.

example.com. 86400 IN NS ns1.example.net.


;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:

ns2.example.com 172800 IN A 10.10.0.2


;; Query time: 80 msec

;; SERVER: 192.228.28.9#53(192.228.28.9)

</pre>
</p><p>
This response is almost identical to the previous one. It's a
referral to the authoritative name servers for the domain example.com,
which are ns2.example.com (in the same domain or zone) and
ns1.example.net (not in the same domain)&mdash;termed an out-of-zone
or an out-of-bailiwick name server. If we choose to use
ns2.example.com, we can use the supplied IP address; this is a normal
&ldquo;glue&rdquo; A record and is required to make delegation work. However, if we
want to use ns1.example.net, we must obtain its IP address by restarting
the process from the root servers through to the .net gTLD servers. We
must do this even if the IP address had been supplied, as it frequently
is, in the ADDITIONAL SECTION of the response.
</p><p>
What's the reason for not trusting an out-of-zone
IP address? We
could pollute our authoritative name server space and allow a domain
hijack. Let's illustrate the dangers. Suppose your local friendly
caching name server comes to my unrelated domain, say www.example.org,
and in this domain's zone file, I have the following zone records:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ORIGIN example.org.

...

; NS RR for the domain -- perfectly correct

IN NS ns3.example.org.

IN NS ns1.example.net.

...

; normal name server A RR

ns3 IN A 192.168.2.4

...

; out-of-zone A RR . potentially naughty

ns1.example.net. IN A 192.168.2.4 ;a malicious server
</pre>
</p><p>
If the caching server trusts the A record for ns1.example.net&mdash;the
out-of-zone server&mdash;and caches it without reading from its
authoritative source, any subsequent resolution of example.com names
using ns1.example.net would use a name server at 192.168.2.4, where a
bogus zone file would likely redirect all example.com traffic to a
malicious site. So, if we have an out-of-zone (or out-of-bailiwick) name
server, any server that is not in the same domain name space as the
target domain, its IP address must not be trusted until obtained
from an authoritative source. This means tracking from the root. Modern
versions of BIND discard all out-of-zone A RRs with an appropriate
log message when the zone is loaded.
</p><p>
In our manual audit process, we could ignore ns1.example.net, but a real
caching DNS will not. It will use it for approximately 50% of queries.
In order to audit the route to our Web addresses thoroughly, we must
check all the DNS servers that appear in the AUTHORITY SECTION. Any
weak DNS may allow a compromise of some proportion of user traffic. The
percentage of queries received by a name server should not be confused
with the number of users. A single query from a large ISP may affect a
disproportionate number of users, especially in regionally focused sites.
</p><p>
It can get a lot worse than this. Let's assume we have tracked
ns1.example.net through the root servers and the gTLD servers for .net,
and we get this response to our last dig:


<pre     class="programlisting">

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.4.1-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @a.gtld-servers.net ns1.example.net

...

;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 49319

;; flags: qr rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 2, ADDITIONAL: 2

;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available


;; QUESTION SECTION:

;ns1.example.net. IN A


;; AUTHORITY SECTION:

example.net. 172800 IN NS ns1.example.net.

example.net. 172800 IN NS ns4.example.org.


;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:

ns1.example.net. 172800 IN A 192.168.2.2

;; Query time: 61 msec

;; SERVER: 192.5.6.30#53(192.5.6.30)

...

</pre>
</p><p>
We have another out-of-bailiwick name server (ns4.example.org), which we
have to track down using exactly the same principles as before, through
the root to the .org TLD servers, which in turn also could respond with
another out-of-bailiwick server and so on. Every one of these name
servers plays a role in name resolution, and any one of them could be a weak
link. Research into what is sometimes called &ldquo;transitive
trust&rdquo; has
shown that in extreme cases, more than 400 name servers can be involved in
resolving a name. If you give other people even a small proportion of
your DNS traffic, make sure that they, and all their DNS servers, are in
good shape.
</p><p>
We even can create DNS loops by erroneous delegation. Here's a trivial
zone file delegation loop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ORIGIN example.org.

...

NS ns1.example.net.

NS ns2.example.net.

...

$ORIGIN example.net.

...

NS ns1.example.org.

NS ns2.example.org.

...
</pre>
</p><p>
Although even a superficial glance will show that these two domains names
are unresolvable, now assume that they are buried in multiple layers of
indirection and transitive trust to perhaps two, three, five or more
levels. Debugging can become extremely complex. Further, assume that we
add one in-zone name server to example.net's zone file. Our problem now
is intermittent errors and timeouts (or slow access) rather than simple
non-availability&mdash;always a much tougher problem to diagnose.
</p><p>
So far, we have navigated the perils of the DNS hierarchy, but we have not
even touched our domain's authoritative name servers. In part two of this
article, we will look at what can happen when we move into
the user's territory. Now, that can get really scary.
