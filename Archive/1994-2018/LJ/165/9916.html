VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that provides
secure communication through an insecure and untrusted network
(like the Internet). Usually, it achieves this by authentication,
encryption,
compression and tunneling. Tunneling is a technique that encapsulates the
packet header and data of one protocol inside the payload field of another
protocol. This way, an encapsulated packet can traverse through networks
it otherwise would not be capable of traversing.

</p></div></div><p>
Currently, the two most common techniques for creating VPNs are IPsec and
SSL/TLS. In this article, I describe the features and characteristics
of
these two techniques and present two short examples of how to create
IPsec
and SSL/TLS tunnels in Linux and verify that the tunnels started
correctly. I also provide a short comparison of these two
techniques.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc08580.0xd00660"></a>
IPsec and Openswan</h2></div></div><p>
IPsec (IP security) provides encryption, authentication
and compression at the network level. IPsec is actually a suite of
protocols, developed by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force),
which have existed for a long time. The first IPsec protocols were
defined in 1995 (RFCs 1825&ndash;1829). Later, in 1998, these RFCs
were depreciated by RFCs 2401&ndash;2412. IPsec implementation in the
2.6 Linux kernel was written by Dave Miller and Alexey Kuznetsov. It
handles both IPv4 and IPv6. IPsec operates at layer 3, the network layer,
in the OSI seven-layer networking model. IPsec is mandatory in IPv6 and
optional in IPv4. To implement IPsec, two new protocols were added:
Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).
Handshaking and exchanging session keys are done with 
the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol.
</p><p>
The AH protocol (RFC 2404) has protocol number 51, and it
authenticates both the header and payload. The AH
protocol does not use encryption, so it is almost never used.
</p><p>
ESP has protocol number 50.
It enables us to add a security policy to the packet and
encrypt it, though encryption is not mandatory. Encryption is done by
the kernel, using the kernel CryptoAPI. When two machines are connected
using the ESP protocol, a unique number identifies this
connection; this number is called SPI (Security Parameter Index). Each
packet that flows between these machines has a Sequence Number (SN),
starting with 0. This SN is increased by one for each
sent packet. Each packet also has a checksum, which is called the ICV
(integrity check value) of the packet. This checksum is calculated using
a secret key, which is known only to these two machines.
</p><p>
IPsec has two modes: transport mode and tunnel mode. When
creating a VPN, we use tunnel mode. This means each IP packet is
fully encapsulated in a newly created IPsec packet. The payload of this
newly created IPsec packet is the original IP packet.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9916f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. An IPsec Tunnel ESP Packet
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 2 shows that a new IP header was added at the right, as a result
of working with a tunnel, and that an ESP header also was added.
</p><p>
There is a problem when the endpoints (which are sometimes called peers)
of the tunnel are behind a NAT (Network Address Translation) device. Using
NAT is a method of connecting multiple machines that have an &ldquo;internal
address&rdquo;, which are not accessible directly to the outside world. These
machines access the outside world through a machine that does have
an Internet address; the NAT is performed on this machine&mdash;usually
a gateway.
</p><p>
When the endpoints of the tunnel are behind a NAT, the NAT modifies the
contents of the IP packet. As a result, this packet will be rejected by
the peer because the signature is wrong. Thus, the IETF issued
some RFCs that try to find a solution for this problem. This solution
commonly is known as NAT-T or NAT Traversal. NAT-T works by encapsulating
IPsec packets in UDP packets, so that these packets will be able to pass
through NAT routers without being dropped. RFC 3948, UDP Encapsulation
of IPsec ESP Packets, deals with NAT-T (see Resources).
</p><p>
Openswan is an open-source project that provides an implementation of user
tools for Linux IPsec. You can create a VPN using Openswan
tools (shown in the short example below). The Openswan Project
was started in 2003 by former FreeS/WAN developers. FreeS/WAN is
the predecessor of Openswan. S/WAN stands for Secure Wide Area Network,
which is actually a trademark of RSA. Openswan runs on many different
platforms, including x86, x86_64, ia64, MIPS and ARM. It supports kernels
2.0, 2.2, 2.4 and 2.6.
</p><p>
Two IPsec kernel stacks are currently available: KLIPS and NETKEY. The
Linux kernel NETKEY code is a rewrite from scratch of the KAME IPsec code. The
KAME Project was a group effort of six companies in Japan to provide a
free IPv6 and IPsec (for both IPv4 and IPv6) protocol stack implementation
for variants of the BSD UNIX computer operating system.
</p><p>
KLIPS is not a part of the Linux kernel.
When using KLIPS, you must apply a patch to the kernel to support NAT-T.
When using NETKEY, NAT-T support is already inside the kernel, and
there is no need to patch the kernel.
</p><p>
When you apply firewall (iptables) rules, KLIPS is the easier case,
because with KLIPS, you can identify IPsec traffic, as this
traffic goes through ipsecX interfaces. You apply iptables rules to these
interfaces in the same way you apply rules to other network interfaces
(such as eth0).
</p><p>
When using NETKEY, applying firewall (iptables) rules is much more complex,
as the traffic does not flow through ipsecX interfaces; one solution can
be marking the packets in the Linux kernel with iptables (with a setmark
iptables rule). This mark is a member of the kernel socket buffer structure
(struct sk_buff, from the Linux kernel networking code); decryption of the
packet does not modify that mark.
</p><p>
Openswan supports Opportunistic Encryption (OE), which enables the creation
of IPsec-based VPNs by advertising and fetching public keys
from a DNS server.

OpenVPN</h2></div></div><p>
OpenVPN is an open-source project founded by James Yonan. It provides a VPN solution based on SSL/TLS. Transport Layer
Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are
cryptographic protocols that provide secure communications data transfer
on the Internet. SSL has been in existence since the early '90s.
</p><p>
The OpenVPN networking model is based on TUN/TAP virtual devices; TUN/TAP
is part of the Linux kernel. The first TUN driver in Linux was developed
by Maxim Krasnyansky.
</p><p>
OpenVPN installation and configuration is simpler in comparison with
IPsec. OpenVPN supports RSA authentication, Diffie-Hellman key agreement,
HMAC-SHA1 integrity checks and more. When running in server mode, it
supports multiple clients (up tp 128) to connect to a VPN server over
the same port. You can set up your own Certificate Authority (CA) and
generate certificates and keys for an OpenVPN server and multiple clients.
</p><p>
OpenVPN operates in user-space mode; this makes it easy to port OpenVPN
to other operating systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc08580.0xd010b0"></a>
Example: Setting Up a VPN Tunnel with IPsec and Openswan</h2></div></div><p>
First, download and install the ipsec-tools package and the Openswan
package (most distros have these packages).
</p><p>
The VPN tunnel has two participants on its ends, called left and
right, and which participant is considered left or right is arbitrary.
You have to configure various parameters for these two ends in
/etc/ipsec.conf (see man 5 ipsec.conf). The /etc/ipsec.conf file
is divided into sections. The conn section contains a connection
specification, defining a network connection to be made using IPsec.
</p><p>
An example of a conn section in /etc/ipsec.conf, which defines a tunnel
between two nodes on the same LAN, with the left one as 192.168.0.89 and the
right one as 192.168.0.92, is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
...
conn linux-to-linux
        #
        # Simply use raw RSA keys
        # After starting openswan, run:
        # ipsec showhostkey --left (or --right)
        # and fill in the connection similarly
        # to the example below.
        left=192.168.0.89
        leftrsasigkey=0sAQPP...
        # The remote user.
        #
        right=192.168.0.92
        rightrsasigkey=0sAQON...
        type=tunnel
        auto=start
...
</pre>
</p><p>
You can generate the leftrsasigkey and rightrsasigkey on both
participants by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ipsec rsasigkey --verbose 2048 &gt; rsa.key
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc08580.0xd01370"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Then, copy and paste the contents of rsa.key into
/etc/ipsec.secrets.
</p><p>
In some cases, IPsec clients are roaming clients (with
a random IP address). This happens typically when the client is a
laptop used from remote locations (such clients are called
Roadwarriors). In this case, use the following in ipsec.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
right=%any
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc08580.0xd01528"></a></h2></div></div><p>
instead of:

<pre     class="programlisting">
right=ipAddress
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc08580.0xd01688"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The %any keyword is used to specify an unknown IP address.
</p><p>
The type parameter of the connection in this example is tunnel (which
is the default). Other types can be transport, signifying host-to-host
transport mode; passthrough, signifying that no IPsec processing should
be done at all; drop, signifying that packets should be discarded;
and reject, signifying that packets should be discarded and a diagnostic
ICMP should be returned.
</p><p>
The auto parameter of the connection tells which operation should be done
automatically at IPsec startup. For example, auto=start tells it to load
and initiate the connection; whereas auto=ignore (which is the default)
signifies no automatic startup operation. Other values for the auto
parameter can be add, manual or route.
</p><p>
After configuring /etc/ipsec.conf, start the service with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
service ipsec start
</pre>
</p><p>
You can perform a series of checks to get info about IPsec on your machine
by typing <tt  >ipsec verify</tt>.
And, output of <tt  >ipsec verify</tt> might look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Checking your system to see if IPsec has installed and started correctly:
Version check and ipsec on-path                                 [OK]
Linux Openswan U2.4.7/K2.6.21-rc7 (netkey)
Checking for IPsec support in kernel                            [OK]
NETKEY detected, testing for disabled ICMP send_redirects       [OK]
NETKEY detected, testing for disabled ICMP accept_redirects     [OK]
Checking for RSA private key (/etc/ipsec.d/hostkey.secrets)     [OK]
Checking that pluto is running                                  [OK]
Checking for 'ip' command                                       [OK]
Checking for 'iptables' command                                 [OK]
Opportunistic Encryption Support                                [DISABLED]
</pre>
</p><p>
You can get information about the tunnel you created by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ipsec auto --status
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can view various low-level IPSec messages in the
kernel syslog.
</p><p>
You can test and verify that the packets flowing between the two
participants are indeed esp frames by opening an FTP connection (for
example),
between the two participants and running:


<pre     class="programlisting">
tcpdump -f esp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 96 bytes
</pre>
</p><p>
You should see something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
IP 192.168.0.92 &gt; 192.168.0.89: ESP(spi=0xd514eed9,seq=0x7)
IP 192.168.0.89 &gt; 192.168.0.92: ESP(spi=0x3a1563b9,seq=0x6)
IP 192.168.0.89 &gt; 192.168.0.92: ESP(spi=0x3a1563b9,seq=0x7)
IP 192.168.0.92 &gt; 192.168.0.89: ESP(spi=0xd514eed9,seq=0x8)
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the spi (Security Parameter Index) header is the same for all
packets; this is an identifier of the connection.
</p><p>
If you need to support NAT traversal, add
<tt  >nat_traversal=yes</tt> in
ipsec.conf; <tt  >nat_traversal=no</tt> is the default.
</p><p>
The Linux IPsec stack can work with pluto from Openswan, racoon from the
KAME Project (which is included in ipsec-tools) or isakmpd from OpenBSD.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc08580.0x10fa170"></a>
Example: Setting Up a VPN Tunnel with OpenVPN</h2></div></div><p>
First, download and install the OpenVPN package (most distros have
this package).
</p><p>
Then, create a shared key by doing the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
openvpn --genkey --secret static.key
</pre>
</p><p>
You can create this key on the server side or the client side, but
you should copy this key to the other side
in a secured channel (like SSH, for example).
This key is exchanged between client and server when the tunnel is created.
</p><p>
This type of shared key is the simplest key; you also can use CA-based keys. The CA can be on a different
machine from the OpenVPN server. The OpenVPN HOWTO provides more details on
this (see Resources).
</p><p>
Then, create a server configuration file named server.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dev tun
ifconfig 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2
secret static.key
comp-lzo
</pre>
</p><p>
On the client side, create the following configuration file named
client.conf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
remote serverIpAddressOrHostName
dev tun
ifconfig 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.1
secret static.key
comp-lzo
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the order of IP addresses has changed in the client.conf
configuration file.
</p><p>
The comp-lzo directive enables compression on the VPN link.
</p><p>
You can set the mtu of the tunnel by adding the tun-mtu directive.
When using Ethernet bridging, you should use dev tap instead of dev tun.
</p><p>
The default port for the tunnel is UDP port 1194 (you can verify this by
typing <tt  >netstat -nl | grep 1194</tt> after starting the tunnel).
</p><p>
Before you start the VPN, make sure that the TUN interface
(or TAP interface, in case you use Ethernet bridging) is not firewalled.
</p><p>
Start the vpn on the server by running <tt  >openvpn
server.conf</tt> and running <tt  >openvpn
client.conf</tt> on the
client.
</p><p>
You will get an output like this on the client: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
OpenVPN 2.1_rc2 x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu [SSL] [LZO2] [EPOLL] built on
Mar  3 2007
IMPORTANT: OpenVPN's default port number is now 1194, based on an official
port number assignment by IANA. OpenVPN 2.0-beta16 and earlier used 5000
as
the default port.
LZO compression initialized
TUN/TAP device tun0 opened
/sbin/ip link set dev tun0 up mtu 1500
/sbin/ip addr add dev tun0 local 10.0.0.2 peer 10.0.0.1
UDPv4 link local (bound): [undef]:1194
UDPv4 link remote: 192.168.0.89:1194
Peer Connection Initiated with 192.168.0.89:1194
Initialization Sequence Completed
</pre>
</p><p>
You can verify that the tunnel is up by pinging the server from the client
(ping 10.0.0.1 from the client).
</p><p>
The TUN interface emulates a PPP (Point-to-Point) network device and
the TAP emulates an Ethernet device. A user-space program can open a
TUN device and can read or write to it. You can apply iptables rules
to a TUN/TAP virtual device in the same way you would do it to an Ethernet device
(such as eth0).

IPsec and OpenVPN&mdash;a Short Comparison</h2></div></div><p>
IPsec is considered the standard for VPN; many vendors (including Cisco, Nortel,
CheckPoint and many more) manufacture devices with built-in IPsec
functionalities, which enable them to connect to other IPsec clients.
</p><p>
However, we should be a bit cautious here: different manufacturers may
implement IPsec in a noncompatible manner on their devices, which can
pose a problem.
</p><p>
OpenVPN is not supported currently by most vendors.
</p><p>
IPsec is much more complex than OpenVPN and involves kernel code; this
makes porting IPsec to other operating systems a much heavier task. It is
much easier to port OpenVPN to other operating systems than IPsec, because
OpenVPN runs entirely in user space and is not involved with kernel code.
</p><p>
Both IPsec and OpenVPN use HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code) to authenticate packets. 
</p><p>
OpenVPN is based on using the OpenSSL library; it can run over UDP
(which is the default and preferred protocol) or TCP. As opposed to
IPsec, which runs in kernel, it runs in user space, so it is heavier
than IPsec in terms of performance.
</p><p>
Configuring and applying firewall (iptables) rules in OpenVPN is
usually easier than configuring such rules with Openswan in an IPsec-based
tunnel.
