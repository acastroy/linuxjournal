Hosting servlets via Apache, mod_jk, Tomcat, mod_ssl and a few rewrite
rules.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x285d298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Hosting multiple Java Web-enabled applications with Apache/SSL in
combination with Tomcat is potentially highly detailed. Separating
the dynamic from the static content requires URL rewriting and
aliases. This article discusses one viable configuration.
</p><p>
I describe the basics of how to host multiple Java Web
applications using a pure Apache project approach. In other words, I 
explain how to apply Apache, mod_ssl, some rewrite rules and the Tomcat
Servlet container to gain control of a consistent and viable production
environment. In real life, I am a more-than-a-little-busy developer, and
one of my more-recent tasks was to define and implement a structure
to host a complex database-intensive Web-enabled
searchable publication mechanism through the life cycle. I condense the experience gained
and explain the most relevant details here.
</p><p>
The basics of placing an Apache Web server in front of multiple Tomcat
servers is explained in an article by Daniel McCarthy on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Web site (see Resources). I take this article somewhat
further by adding the ability to provide secure communication via SSL and
show how to optimize performance by separating dynamic content, such as JSP
pages, from static content, such as HTML and images. Further security issues
also are nodded at briefly. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x285d558"></a>
Preparations</h2></div></div><p>
The following preparations are
for those who want to generate a working instance of the infrastructure
mentioned. This infrastructure involves a locally configured Apache
server running with two Tomcat instances, all being referenced from a Web
browser via different loopback (127.0.0.x) addresses. This
article is still worth reading without following through with the recipe.
</p><p>
I assume that the following have been installed: Apache 1.3x
Web server, mod_ssl, mod_jk and two instances of a Tomcat 5.5.x server,
one running the ajp1.3 connector on the standard port of 8009 and the
shutdown port of 8005, and the other on port 8019 and 8015. I
have chosen a plain-old stable and reliable Apache 1.3.x server over an
Apache 2.x version on the principle that you shouldn't fix what isn't
broken. At 
the Institutes for which I have been responsible, during the past few years
they have run Apache 1.3.x without issue, the system administrators have
built up their knowledge, and the systems are maintained and patched to the
highest levels and snuggly sit in the maturity section of the Web
server's
life cycle. The same applies for the choice of mod_jk over mod_jk2. In fact, mod_jk2
development has been discontinued due to the complexity of configuration.
</p><p>
If you have a Debian-based Linux distribution, to install the Apache server
without compiling, try the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install apache
sudo apt-get install libapache-mod-jk
sudo apt-get install libapache-mod-ssl
</pre>
</p><p>
You should now have a running Apache instance with the configuration
files sitting under /etc/apache.
</p><p>
For the Tomcat servers, you have two choices. The first is to use one
instance of the binary and then two instances of the configuration, and
then run a startup script that applies the unique instance of the binary
with different configurations. The second choice is to use two copies of the
Tomcat server and modify the server.xml file. The advantage of the first
approach is the avoidance of replication of executable code. However, this
is nearly always a false economy. The second approach has advantages for
complex environments where you want to host different versions of Tomcat
servers. The second approach is more relevant for Application Service
Providers that have multiple customers. A division exists between code
that is written for Java 1.5 that runs natively in Tomcat 5.5 (without
installing the 1.4 compatibility package) and Java 1.4 that runs in Tomcat
5. Furthermore, the Servlet implementation is more up to date the newer the
Tomcat version. Due to the current velocity of change, software that
is hosted for more than a year can be considered legacy, so there always will
be a demand for the use of older but still reliable servers.
</p><p>
Next, we want to test only on the loopback addresses with no packets
reaching the network. This can be achieved by modifying the /etc/hosts
file to something similar to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
127.0.0.10 bronze_a
127.0.0.11 silver
127.0.0.12 gold
</pre>
</p><p>
Therefore, every time you type <tt  >https://bronze_a</tt>, no DNS lookups are
necessary. The packets from the browser never will reach the Internet
and will stay local to 127.0.0.10.
</p><p>
In the main Apache configuration file, httpd.conf, you will find an include
line that tells Apache to look under the conf.d directory for further
configuration. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Include /etc/apache/conf.d
</pre>
</p><p>
Every time a package is installed that requires configuration changes
for Apache, you will find an extra configuration file within the conf.d
directory. In fact, if you want (for a nice aside), try to install Drupal
and read the Drupal.conf file that is dumped.
</p><p>
I want to keep our work separate from the rest of the world's. No doubt,
we will generate mistakes during playtime. Add a second line to include
a directory for our virtual hosting files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Include /etc/apache/vhosts
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, make the directories /etc/apache/ssl and /etc/apache/vhosts. Later,
we will place our certificates and server keys in the SSL directory, one
set per virtual host.
</p><p>
Next, check the httpd.conf file to see whether the SSL engine is turned on. I
want to turn the engine off until enabled per virtual host. So, the
line <tt  >SSLEngine On</tt> should change to
<tt  >SSLEngine Off</tt>.
</p><p>
Now we have an Apache 1.3.x server that is ready for action.
</p><p>
If you have not set up your Tomcat servers yet, you need to
modify the following lines under the tomcat_root/conf/server.xml file
for the second instance. Change the port numbers to 8015 for the shutdown
command and port 8019 for the AJP/1.3 connector:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;Server port="8005" shutdown="SHUTDOWN"&gt; 
&lt;Connector port="8080"
&lt;Connector port="8009"
       enableLookups="false"  protocol="AJP/1.3" /&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
For the sake of security, change the shutdown
attribute from the value SHUTDOWN to some randomly long string.
Otherwise,
perhaps on the worst day under a badly defended system, a cracker can
Telnet in and type <tt  >SHUTDOWN</tt>, and then your server
is down. Also,
I would comment out the 8080 connector. There is no need to 
expose Tomcat directly to the Internet.
</p><p>
Only one task is left&mdash;to create two Web applications. Under
the webapps directory of the first Tomcat instance, create a bronze_a
directory, and then under that directory, create a WEB-INF directory. Place the following
web.xml file in WEB_INF:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt; 
&lt;web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee"
    
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee 
    http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/web-app_2_4.xsd"
    version="2.4"&gt;

  &lt;display-name&gt;BRONZE_A&lt;/display-name&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;
    BRONZE_A Dynamic
  &lt;/description&gt;
&lt;welcome-file-list&gt;
 &lt;welcome-file&gt;
index.jsp
 &lt;/welcome-file&gt;
&lt;/welcome-file-list&gt;
&lt;/web-app&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the mention of web-app_2_4.xsd. This web.xml file will not work
under Tomcat 5, which uses the 2.3 standard. Under the webapps/bronze_a
directory, place the following index.jsp file. This is our poor yet
relevant example of dynamic content:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;%String mess="Hello World from Bronze_a"; %&gt;
 &lt;%=mess%&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;%=request.getRequestURI()%&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Follow the same procedure for the second instance, but replace the string
bronze_a with silver under the webapps/silver directory of the second Tomcat
instance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x285e058"></a>
Working Together</h2></div></div><p>
Making the Apache and Tomcat servers talk with each other is
surprisingly straightforward. If this doesn't already exist somewhere within
the httpd.conf file, add the following lines to the end of the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
JkWorkersFile /usr/local/apache/conf/workers.properties
JkLogFile /usr/local/apache/logs/mod_jk.log
JkLogLevel error
</pre>
</p><p>
The exact location of the worker.properties file is left to your
discretion. The JkLoggFile and JkLogLevel values are not necessary, as we will
override them within the virtual host files. However, for peace
of mind, I like to place default values in case of misconfiguration
later. The worker property defines how the connections behave. The first
line defines the list of workers&mdash;in this case, bronze and silver. The next
lines are for the details of configuration for each worker set. bronze
attaches itself to port 8008 and silver to port 8019, with both sets
talking the AJ1.3 protocol. These two worker sets are mentioned
later in the virtual host files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
worker.list=bronze,silver

worker.bronze.port=8009
worker.bronze.host=localhost
worker.bronze.type=ajp13

worker.silver.port=8019
worker.silver.host=localhost
worker.silver.type=ajp13
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x285e268"></a>
Virtual Hosting</h2></div></div><p>
Virtual hosting is the hosting of multiple servers on one machine 
by listening for either incoming hostnames or IP addresses. Using
multiple virtual hosts with SSL works only for IP-based
virtual hosting. Let me explain by example. First, say I want to view a
normal transaction between a Web browser and a server. To achieve this, I
use the rather excellent Apache SOAP tool TcpTunnelGui. To do this, first download
the current archive from the Apache SOAP Web site (see Resources). On
expanding it, you will see a directory called lib. Perform the following
actions, and if all goes well, you will have Java installed locally and
have brought up the GUI:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd lib
java -cp ./soap.jar org.apache.soap.util.net.TcpTunnelGui 
 &#8618;9001 localhost 80
</pre>
</p><p>
The GUI displays the text from any TCP connection going through
port 9001 and redirects the input back to localhost 80. Feel free to
change localhost to point to your own test Web server. In your browser,
type <tt  >http://localhost:9001</tt>. Expect to see the
following type of transaction:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Accept: */*
Referer: http://localhost:9001
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; 
 &#8618;MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; CHWIE_NL70; 
 &#8618;SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Host: localhost:9001
Connection: Keep-Alive
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the browser sends information about itself and also the
host and referrer variable. Apache uses the host variable in name-based
virtual hosting to work out which configuration file to apply. By typing
<tt  >https://localhost:9001</tt>, you will get a garbled response similar to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
?L^A^C?+^A
</pre>
</p><p>
The Host variable is not available until the SSL encryption is
complete. Therefore, having a different SSL certificate per virtual host
requires that the SSL process occurs before configuration. Yes, it's the proverbial
chicken-and-egg problem. Why do we need multiple SSL certificates and,
thus, IP-based configuration in the first place? The answer has to do
with the cn attribute in the SSL certificate. For a certificate to be
accepted as a valid server certificate by browsers, the cn attribute
has to be defined with the value of the hostname of the target server.
So, for the IP address 127.0.0.10, we need a certificate with cn=bronze_a, and
for the IP address 127.0.0.11, a certificate with cn=silver.
</p><p>
To generate self-signed certificates with your own local CA, you 
need to have OpenSSL installed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-cache search openssl
sudo apt-get install openssl
</pre>
</p><p>
Use these three commands to generate a self-signed certificate:

<pre     class="programlisting">
openssl req -new -out silver.csr
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out silver.key
openssl x509 -in silver.csr -out silver.cert 
 &#8618;-req -signkey silver.key -days 365
</pre>
</p><p>
The first command generates the certificate request. Remember, the cn
attribute must be the same value as the hostname contained within your
virtual host&mdash;for example, silver or bronze_a. The other attributes
can
be of any text value you consider reasonable.
</p><p>
The second command moves the password from the newly generated server's
private key to silver.key, removing the password protection. This is
needed; otherwise, every time you restart Apache, you will be asked to
type in the password at the command line. The final line generates a
relevant certificate based on the certificate request. Place both the
cert and key files in the /etc/apache/ssl directory. Perform the same
action for bronze_a. Remember to defend the ssl directory with the least
permissions possible.
</p><p>
To activate both port 80 and 443 for bronze, add the following
virtual host under vhosts:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Listen 127.0.0.10:443
&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.10:443&gt;

ServerName bronze_a
Alias /static/ /var/www/customers/bronze_a/content/
RedirectMatch ^/$ https://bronze_a/bronze_a/

SSLEngine On
SSLCertificateFile ssl/bronze_a.cert
SSLCertificateKeyFile ssl/bronze_a.key

JkMount /bronze_a/* bronze
JkMount /bronze_a bronze
JkLogFile /usr/local/apache/logs/bronze_a_mod_jk.log
JkLogLevel info
JkLogStampFormat "[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y] "

RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule ^/(.*):SSL$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]
  RewriteRule ^/(.*):NOSSL$ http://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

Listen 127.0.0.10:80
&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.10:80&gt;

ServerName bronze_a
Alias /static/ /var/www/customers/bronze_a/content/
RedirectMatch ^/$&nbsp; https://bronze_a/bronze_a/

JkMount /bronze_a/* bronze
JkMount /bronze_a bronze
JkLogFile /usr/local/apache/logs/80_bronze_a_mod_jk.log
JkLogLevel info
JkLogStampFormat "[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y] "

RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule ^/(.*):SSL$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]
  RewriteRule ^/(.*):NOSSL$ http://%{SERVER_NAME}/$1 [R,L]

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
For silver, create a similar virtual host but with
the 127.0.0.11 IP address, and replace the string bronze_a with the
string silver. Double-check that your SSL
certificate and private key are pointed to correctly.
</p><p>
Turn on SSL with these
three little commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SSLEngine On
SSLCertificateFile ssl/bronze_a.cert
SSLCertificateKeyFile ssl/bronze_a.key
</pre>
</p><p>
The rewrite rules are culled from the mod_ssl FAQ. What is happening
is that you have control over the relative URLs, so you can switch
between the SSL and non-SSL port easily. When you use /url:NOSSL as
a URL, the URL is rewritten to HTTP instead of HTTPS, and the same is true
for HTTP to HTTPS using /url:SSL.
</p><p>
Enable the mounting of the Tomcat server by the workers with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
JkMount /bronze_a/* bronze
JkMount /bronze_a bronze
</pre>
</p><p>
It is good practice to separate log files used potentially for
debugging&mdash;for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
JkLogFile /usr/local/apache/logs/80_bronze_a_mod_jk.log
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x285ec08"></a>
Living with Static and Dynamic Content</h2></div></div><p>
Apache is better than Tomcat for delivering static content, security
and URL reshaping. Therefore, it is of global benefit to separate the
static and dynamic content of your site and allow Apache to deal
with the static content via the filesystem and the dynamic content via
mod_jk. One instance of the URL remapping is the top-level redirect. We
had mounted mod_jk at /bronze_a. If a user had typed
<tt  >http://bronze_a/</tt>,
he or she would either have found an empty page or seen a pretty file
listing. You can resolve this issue by placing an index.html page at the
top-level location or by redirecting down. The redirection is achieved via:

<pre     class="programlisting">
RedirectMatch ^/$&nbsp; https://bronze_a/bronze_a/
</pre>
</p><p>
To make sure the right page is picked up by the uri /bronze_a/, the
following lines exist in the web.xml file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;welcome-file-list&gt;
 &lt;welcome-file&gt;
index.jsp
 &lt;/welcome-file&gt;
&lt;/welcome-file-list

</pre>
</p><p>
A simple method to link to the static content is to use an alias within
the virtual host. For example, https//bronze_a/static/:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Alias /static/ /var/www/customers/bronze_a/content/
</pre>
</p><p>
Developing Java Web applications tends to be a team sport. Static
content, such as images (at least in my environment), tend to change more than the
application itself. Therefore, you may consider doing the obvious and
setting an FTP root above the static content, but not above the more
sensitive dynamic content. Then, you can force the Web application to
go through a full series of tests before placing any new version in
production. In fact, you may even consider a hybrid solution. Developers
like to work through CVS. By placing both static and dynamic content
within a war file, you keep all your code and content together and have
a synchronized deployment via the re-installation of the war file. This
simplifies deployment, and system administrators have to perform
the same repetitive task only when new property files or content is
approved. Next, you would need to add some AliasMatch rules to treat
certain URLs as file locations, dishing the files up directly rather than
through mod_jk, thus avoiding potential performance hits. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
AliasMatch /web/customers/(.*)/javascript/(.*) 
 /usr/local/tomcat6/webapps/$1/javascript/$2
AliasMatch /web/customers/(.*)/images/(.*) 
 /usr/local/tomcat6/webapps/$1/images/$2
AliasMatch /web/customers/(.*)/css/(.*) 
 /usr/local/tomcat6/webapps/$1/css/$2
</pre>
</p><p>
This would map files in the CSS, JavaScript or image directories in
the Web application as static content. For example,
https://xxxxx/web/customers/little.com/javascript/editor.js 
translates to /usr/local/tomcat6/webapps/little.com/javascript/editor.js.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
There are many ways to kill a cat, which, for cats, is most
unfortunate. This article has shown one approach to hosting Web
applications. I do not pretend that this is the only approach; it's
simply one
that has worked for me. At great speed I have mentioned mod_ssl, mod_jk
and one approach to separating static and dynamic content. I hope this
article has given you enough information to have a go at testing your
hosting concepts yourself. With some basic configuration, it is relatively
straightforward to control your SSL-enabled virtual hosts.
