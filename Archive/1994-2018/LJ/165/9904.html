Read along to understand how GCC works, find out what all those other
programs in the toolchain directory do, and learn some tips and tricks 
to become more comfortable with most indispensable tool in your
project.

GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection, is a tool used by nearly every embedded
engineer, even those who don't target Linux. In release since 1987,
supporting every processor known to man, GCC is a juggernaut of software
engineering that, because of its ubiquity and ease of use, doesn't get
the admiration it deserves.
</p><p>
When used in an embedded project, GCC capably does another trick,
cross-compilation, without complaint. Simply invoke the compiler and the
right things will happen. Under the covers, GCC is a very complex tool
with lots of knobs to turn to fine-tune the compilation and linking
process; this article looks at how to build a GCC cross-compiler,
examines the process that GCC uses to compile a program and shares some
productivity-boosting tips and tricks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1430580.0x1528500"></a>
Building a Cross-Compiler</h2></div></div><p>
When starting an embedded project, the first tool needed is a
cross-compiler, a compiler that generates code intended to
work on a machine different from the one on which the code generation
occurred. Sometimes, it's possible to obtain a prebuilt cross-compiler 
(from a commercial or noncommercial source), short-circuiting the need
to build from source; however, some projects require that all tools
must be re-creatable from source. No matter why
GCC needs to be built, there are several different approaches to building
a cross-compiler.
</p><p>
Quite possibly the easiest way is by using the crosstool Project,
created by Dan Kegel and hosted at <a href="http://www.kegel.com/crosstool" target="_self">www.kegel.com/crosstool</a>.
Using this project involves downloading the source code
and making one of the presupplied files feed the right
parameters into the script that builds the compiler. The matrix
of supported platforms and software versions can be found at
<a href="http://www.kegel.com/crosstool/crosstool-0.43/buildlogs" target="_self">www.kegel.com/crosstool/crosstool-0.43/buildlogs</a>,
and choosing
something that's marked as working will yield a compiler in a few hours.
crosstool will download the right software, even the patches, necessary to
make the software work on the target platform. However, if the project
requires support for an alternate C library, crosstool becomes more
difficult to use.
</p><p>
Because many developers want to use uClibc, a smaller implementation of
the C library, it's fortunate that this project has something similar to
crosstool, called buildroot, located at <a href="http://buildroot.uclibc.net" target="_self">buildroot.uclibc.net</a>. As a
bonus, buildroot, along with building a cross-compiler, also can be used
to build a root filesystem for the board based on the related BusyBox
Project. The user configures a buildroot run using a process similar
to that of the kernel configuration to ready the build. This project
doesn't have a chart of known working configurations like crosstool,
so finding a working configuration can be difficult.
</p><p>
Finally, for the type of person who doesn't like the idea of wading through
somebody else's build scripts when things don't work, building a
cross-complier by hand isn't as daunting a process as one would
expect.
The following steps outline the process, where $TARGET is the target
processor and $INSTALLAT is the directory where the compiler will reside
after being built:
</p><p>
1. Download and build binutils:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tar xzf binutils-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz
$./binutils-&lt;version&gt;/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix=$INSTALLAT
$ make ; make install

</pre>
</p><p>
2. Copy the include and asm from the board's kernel to the installation
directory:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir $INSTALLAT/include
$ cp -rvL $KERNEL/include/linux $KERNEL/include/asm $INSTALLAT/include
</pre>
</p><p>
3. Download and build bootstrap GCC.
At this point, it's best to build the bootstrap GCC in its own directory
and not the directory where it has been unpacked:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tar xzf gcc-&lt;version&gt;.tar.gz
$ mkdir ~/$TARGET-gcc ; cd ~/$TARGET-gcc
$../gcc-&lt;version&gt;/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix=$INSTALLAT
--with-headers=$INSTALLAT/include --enable-languages="c" -Dinhibit_libc
$ make all ; make install

</pre>
</p><p>
4. Download and build glibc (or alternate libc) with the bootstrap compiler.
Like GCC, the build of the library works best when you configure and
make outside the source tree:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ tar xzf glibc-&lt;version&gt; --target=$TARGET --prefix=$INSTALLAT                              --enable-add-ons --disable-sanity-checks
$ CC=$INSTALLAT/bin/$TARGET-gcc make 
$ CC=$INSTALLAT/bin/$TARGET-gcc make install 

</pre>
</p><p>
5. Build the final GCC.
The bootstrap compiler was built to build the C library. Now, GCC can be
built to use the cross-compiled C library when building its own programs:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ cd ~/$TARGET-gcc
$../gcc-&lt;version&gt;/configure --target=$TARGET --prefix=$INSTALLAT
--with-headers=$INSTALLAT/include --enable-languages="c"
$ make all ; make install

</pre>
</p><p>
At the end of this process, the newly built cross-compiler will be
at $INSTALLAT/bin. An oft-used strategy for those needing a specially
configured GCC is to use crosstool or buildroot to download and patch
the source files and then interrupt the process. At this point, the user
applies additional patches and builds the components with the desired
configuration settings.
</p><p>
Before leaving this section, there's a frequently asked question from
embedded engineers targeting Pentium machines doing development on
desktops that are essentially same. In this case, is a cross-compiler
necessary? The answer is yes. Building a cross-compiler for this
configuration insulates the build environment and library dependencies
from the development machine that happened to be used to build the
source code. Because desktop systems can change revisions several times
a year, and not all team members may be using the same version, having a
consistent environment for compiling the embedded project is essential
to eliminate the possibility of build configuration-related
defects.

The Toolchain: More Just a Compiler</h2></div></div><p>
The collection of programs necessary to compile and link an application is
called the toolchain, and GCC, the compiler, is only one part. A complete
toolchain consists of three separate parts: binutils, language-specific
standard libraries and the compiler. Notably absent is the debugger,
which is frequently supplied with the toolchain but is not a necessary
component.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1430580.0x1528fa8"></a>
binutils</h2></div></div><p>
binutils (binary utilities), performs the grunt work of manipulating
files in a way that's appropriate for the target machine. Key parts of
the toolchain, such as the linker and assembler, reside in the binutils
Project and aren't part of the GCC Project.
</p><p>
Hidden inside the binutils Project is another nifty bit of software, the
BFD library, which technically is a separate project. The BFD, Binary
Descriptor Library (the actual acronym unpacks to something too bawdy
for this publication), provides an abstract, consistent interface to
object files, such as handling details like address relocation, symbol
translation and byte order. Because of the features supplied by BFD,
most tools that need to read or manipulate binaries for target reside
in the binutils Project to best take advantage of what BFD has to offer.
</p><p>
For the record, binutils contains the following programs:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
addr2line: given a binary with debugging information and an address,
returns the line and file of that address.
</p></li><li><p>
ar: a program for creating code archives that are a collection of
object files.
</p></li><li><p>
c++filt: demangles symbols. With classes and overloading, the linker
can't depend on the underlying language to provide unique symbol names.
c++filt will turn _ZN5pointC1ERKS_ into something readable.
A godsend when debugging.
</p></li><li><p>
gprof: produces reports based on data collected when running code with
profiling enabled.
</p></li><li><p>
nlmconv: converts an object file into a Netware Loadable Module (NLM).
If you've
ever worked with NLMs, you probably did so with your collar turned up and
cringed when seeing ABEND on your terminal. It's noted here because nlmconv
is rarely, if ever, distributed with a toolchain.
</p></li><li><p>
nm: given an object file, lists symbols such as those in the public
section.
</p></li><li><p>
objcopy: translates a file from one format to another, used in the
embedded file to generate S-Records from ELF binaries.
</p></li><li><p>
objdump/readelf: reads and prints out information from a binary file.
readelf performs the same function; however, it can work only with ELF-formatted files.
</p></li><li><p>
ranlib: a complement to ar. Generates an index of the public symbols in
an archive to speed link time. Users can get the same effect by using
ar -s.
</p></li><li><p>
size: prints out the size of various components of a binary file.
</p></li><li><p>
strings: extracts the strings from a binary, performing correct target
host byte order translation. It's frequently used as the slacker's way of
seeing what libraries a binary links to, as ldd doesn't work for
cross-compiled programs: <tt  >strings &lt;binary&gt; | grep
lib</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
strip: removes symbols or sections, typically debugging information, from files.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1430580.0x1529a50"></a>
C Library</h2></div></div><p>
The C language specification contains only 32 keywords, give or take
a few, depending on the compiler's implementation of the language. Like C,
most languages have the concept of a standard library supplying common
operations, such as string manipulation, and an interface to the filesystem
and memory. The majority of the programming that happens in C involves
interacting with the C library. As a result, much of the code in the
project isn't written by the engineers, but rather is supplied by the
standard libraries. Picking a standard library that has been designed
to be small can have a drastic impact on the final size of the project.
</p><p>
Most embedded engineers opt for using a C library other than the standard
GNU C Library, otherwise known as glibc, to conserve resources. glibc was
designed for portability and compatibility, and as such, it contains code for
cases not encountered or that can be sacrificed on an embedded system.
One example is the lack of binary compatibility between releases
of the library. Although glibc rarely breaks an interface once published,
embedded standard libraries do so without any qualms.
</p><p>

with the pros and cons of each.

Preprocessor and Compiler</h2></div></div><p>
These components perform only a small slice of the work necessary
to produce an executable. The preprocessor, for languages that
support such a concept, runs before the compiler proper, performing text
transformations before the compiler transforms the input into machine code
for the target. During the compilation process, the compiler performs
optimizations as specified by the user and produces a parse tree.
The parse tree is translated into assembler code, and the assembler
uses that input to make an object file. If the user wants to produce
an executable binary, the object file is then passed to the linker to
produce an executable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1430580.0x1520e90"></a>
How It All Fits Together</h2></div></div><p>
After looking at all the components in a toolchain, the following
section steps through the process GCC takes when compiling C source files
into a binary. The process starts by invoking GCC with the files to be
compiled and a parameter specifying output to be stored to thebinary:

<pre     class="programlisting">
armv5l-linux-gcc file1.c file2.c -o thebinary
</pre>
</p><p>
GCC is actually a driver program that invokes the underlying compiler and
binutils to produce the final executable. By looking at the extension
of the input file and using the rules built in to the compiler, GCC
determines what programs to run in what order to build the output. To
see what happens in order to compile the file, add the -### parameter:

<pre     class="programlisting">
armv5l-linux-gcc -### file1.c file2.c -o thebinary
</pre>
</p><p>
This produces virtual reams of output on the console. Much of the output
has been clipped, saving untold virtual trees, to make it
more readable for this example. The first information that appears describes the version
of the compiler and how it was built&mdash;very important information when
queried &ldquo;was GCC built with thumb-interworking disabled?&rdquo;

<pre     class="programlisting">

Target: armv5l-linux
Configured with: &lt;the contents of a autoconf command line&gt; 
Thread model: posix
gcc version 4.1.0 20060304 (TimeSys 4.1.0-3)

</pre>
</p><p>
After outputting the state of the tool, the compilation process starts.
Each source file is compiled with the cc1 compiler, the &ldquo;real&rdquo; compiler
for the target architecture. When GCC was compiled, it was configured
to pass certain parameters to cc1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"/opt/timesys/toolchains/armv5l-linux/libexec/gcc/
&#8618;armv5l-linux/4.1.0/cc1.exe" "-quiet" "file1.c" 
 &#8618;"-quiet" "-dumpbase" "file1.c" "-mcpu=xscale" 
 &#8618;"-mfloat-abi=soft" "-auxbase" "file1" "-o" 
 &#8618;"/cygdrive/c/DOCUME~1/GENESA~1.TIM/LOCALS~1/Temp/ccC39DVR.s"
</pre>
</p><p>
Now the assembler takes over and turns the file into object code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"/opt/timesys/toolchains/armv5l-linux/lib/gcc/
&#8618;armv5l-linux/4.1.0/../../../../armv5l-linux/bin/as.exe" 
 &#8618;"-mcpu=xscale" "-mfloat-abi=soft" "-o" 
 &#8618;"/cygdrive/c/DOCUME~1/GENESA~1.TIM/LOCALS~1/Temp/ccm4aB3B.o" 
 &#8618;"/cygdrive/c/DOCUME~1/GENESA~1.TIM/LOCALS~1/Temp/ccC39DVR.s"
</pre>
</p><p>
The same thing happens for the next file on the command line, file2.c.
The command lines are the same as those for file1.c, but with
different input and output filenames.
</p><p>
After compilation, collect2 performs a linking step and looks for
initialization functions (called constructor functions, but not in the
object-oriented sense) called before the &ldquo;main&rdquo; section of the program.
collect2 gathers these functions together, creates a temporary source
file, compiles it and links that to the rest of the program:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"/opt/timesys/toolchains/armv5l-linux/libexec/gcc/
&#8618;armv5l-linux/4.1.0/collect2.exe" "--eh-frame-hdr" 
 &#8618;"-dynamic-linker" "/lib/ld-linux.so.2" "-X" "-m" 
 &#8618;"armelf_linux" "-p" "-o" "binary" "/opt/timesys/

 &#8618;"/opt/timesys/toolchains/armv5l-linux/lib/

&#8618;toolchains/armv5l-linux/lib/gcc/armv5l-linux/
&#8618;4.1.0/../../../../armv5l-linux/lib/crtn.o"
</pre>
</p><p>
There are some other nifty things in here that warrant pointing out:
</p><p>
1. Here's the option that specifies the dynamic linker to invoke when
running the program on the target platform:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"-dynamic-linker" "/lib/ld-linux.so.2"
</pre>
</p><p>
On Linux platforms, dynamically linked programs actually load by
running a dynamic loader, making themselves a parameter of the linker,
which does the work of loading the libraries into memory and fixing up
the references. If this program isn't in the same place on the target
machine, the program will fail to run with an &ldquo;unable to execute
program&rdquo;
error message. A misplaced linker on the target ensnares every embedded
developer at least once.
</p><p>
2. These files contain the code before the programmer's entry point
(typically main, but you can change that too) and handle things like
initialization of globals, opening the standard file handles, making
that nice array of parameters and other housekeeping functions:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
crtbegin.o
</p></li><li><p>
crt1.o
</p></li><li><p>
crti.o
</p></li></ul></div><p>
3. Likewise, these files contain the code after the last return, such
as closing files and other housekeeping work. Like the prior items,
these are cross-compiled during the GCC build:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
crtend.o
</p></li><li><p>
crtn.o
</p></li></ul></div><p>
And, that's it! At the end of this process, the output is a program
ready for execution on the target platform.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1430580.0x1521ba0"></a>
The spec File</h2></div></div><p>
Recall that GCC is a driver program that knows what program to invoke
to build a certain output, which begs the question, &ldquo;How does it know
that?&rdquo;
This information that was built in to GCC when it was built is kept in
the &ldquo;specs&rdquo;. To see the specs, run GCC with the -dumpspecs parameters:

<pre     class="programlisting">
armv5l-linux-gcc -dumpspecs
</pre>
</p><p>
The console will fill with a few hundred lines of output. The spec file
format evolved over years of development, and it's easier for the computer to
read than for a person. Each line contains instructions for what parameters
to use for a given tool. From the prior example, consider the command
line for the assembler (with the path names removed for readability):

<pre     class="programlisting">
"&lt;path&gt;/as.exe" "-mcpu=xscale" "-mfloat-abi=soft" 
 &#8618;"-o" "&lt;temppath&gt;/ccm4aB3B.o" "&lt;temppath&gt;/ccC39DVR.s"
</pre>
</p><p>
The compiler has the following in the specs for the assembler:

<pre     class="programlisting">
*asm:
%{mbig-endian:-EB} %{mlittle-endian:-EL} %{mcpu=*:-mcpu=%*} 
 &#8618;%{march=*:-march=%*} %{mapcs-*:-mapcs-%*} 
 &#8618;%(subtarget_asm_float_spec) 
 &#8618;%{mthumb-interwork:-mthumb-interwork} 
 &#8618;%{msoft-float:-mfloat-abi=soft} 
 &#8618;%{mhard-float:-mfloat-abi=hard} %{mfloat-abi=*} 
 &#8618;%{mfpu=*} %(subtarget_extra_asm_spec)
</pre>
</p><p>
This line uses some familiar constructs explained below.
Adequately discussing the minutiae of the spec file would require an
article series in itself.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
*asm: this line tells GCC the following line will override the
internal specification for the asm tool.
</p></li><li><p>
%{mbig-endian:-EB}: the pattern
%{symbol:parameter} means if a symbol was passed to GCC, replace it with
parameter; otherwise, this expands to a null string. In our example, the
parameter -mfloat-abi=soft was added this way.
</p></li><li><p>
%(subtarget_extra_asm_spec): evaluate the spec string %(specname). This may result in an empty
string, as it did in our case.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Most users don't need to modify the spec file for their compiler;
however, frequently engineers who inherit a project need to have GCC
recognize nonstandard extensions for files. For example, assembler
source files may have the extension, .arm; in this case, GCC won't know
what to execute, as it doesn't have a rule for that file extension. In
this case, you can create a spec file containing the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
.arm:
@asm
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1430580.0x1522280"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and use the -specs=&lt;file&gt; to pass that to GCC, so that it will know how
to handle files with the .arm extension. The spec file on the command
line will be added to the internal spec file after it has been processed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1430580.0x1522388"></a>
Tips and Tricks of the Trade</h2></div></div><p>
The following tips and tricks should be, if they haven't already, 
stashed on the crib sheet of engineers who work with GCC.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Force GCC to use an alternate C library:</b></span>

<pre     class="programlisting">
armv5l-linux-gcc -nostdlib -nostdinc -isystem 
 &#8618;&lt;path to header files&gt; -L&lt;path to c library&gt; 
 &#8618;-l &lt;c library file&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells GCC to ignore everything it knows about where to find header
files and libraries and instead uses what you tell it. Most alternate
C libraries provide a script that performs this function; however,
some projects can't use the wrapper scripts, and other times, when
experimenting with several versions of a library, the flexibility and
control of specifying this information directly is necessary.

<span   class="bold"><b>Mixed assembler/source output:</b></span>

<pre     class="programlisting">
armv5l-linux-gcc -g program.c -o binary-program
armv5l-linux-objdump -S binary-program
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the best way to see exactly what GCC generated in relation to the input
code. Doing the compilation
with several different optimization settings shows what the compiler
did for the given optimization. Because embedded development pushes the
processor-support envelope, being able to see the generated assembler
code can be instrumental in proving a defect in GCC's support for that
processor. In addition, engineers can use this to validate that the
proper instructions are generated when specifying processor-specific
optimizations.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>List predefined macros:</b></span>

<pre     class="programlisting">

armv5l-linux-gcc -E -dM - &lt; /dev/null

</pre>
</p><p>
An invaluable tool for doing a port, this makes clear what GCC
macros will be set automatically and the value. This will show not only the
standard macros, but also all the ones set for the target architecture.
Keeping this output and comparing it to a newer version of GCC can save
hours of work when code fails to compile or run due to changes.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>List dependencies:</b></span>

<pre     class="programlisting">
armv5l-linux-gcc -M program.c
</pre>
</p><p>
Formally, this command creates a separate make rule for each file on
the command line showing all dependencies. The output is indispensable
when trying to track down problems related to what header files a source
file is using and tracking down problems related to forcing GCC to use
an alternate C library. Deeply nested header files are both unavoidable
and incredibly useful in any nontrivial C project and can consume hours
when trying to debug. Using -MM instead of -M will show only nonsystem
dependencies&mdash;useful noise reduction when the problem resides in the
project files alone.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Show internal steps:</b></span>

<pre     class="programlisting">
armv5l-linux-gcc -### program.c
</pre>
</p><p>
This article already uses this command to make GCC show what steps occur
internally to build a program. When a program isn't compiling or linking
properly, using -### is the fastest route to see what GCC is doing.
Each command is on its own line and can be run individually, so:

<pre     class="programlisting">

armv5l-linux-gcc -### program.c &amp;&gt; compile-commands

</pre>

will produce a file compile&mdash;commands that the user can mark as executable
and run a line at a time to pinpoint the exact cause of a problem.

Wrapping Up</h2></div></div><p>
GCC is a deceptively powerful, complex tool. The developers have created
software that &ldquo;does the right thing&rdquo; with minimal information from the
user. Because it works so well, users frequently forget to spend the time
to learn about GCC's capabilities. This article scratches the surface;
the best advice is to read the documentation and invest a little time each
day to learn how this tool always can do more than expected.
