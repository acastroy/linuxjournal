Writing a Facebook application? It's easy to retrieve information
about Facebook users and their friends as well as display it, using the
RFacebook plugin for Rails.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100c580.0x1104348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Web sites have become increasingly sophisticated during the past few
years, providing a wide variety of applications to the public at large.
Many popular sites now offer a variety of APIs, making it possible to
interact with the sites, or just retrieve data, from within a
program other than an interactive Web browser.
</p><p>
One of the most sophisticated and popular APIs to be unveiled in
recent months is from Facebook. Facebook, as you probably
have heard, was started by Mark Zuckerberg when he was a student at
Harvard. He has since dropped out of college and has led Facebook to
be one of the largest and best-known social-networking Web sites,
offering people a chance to find and connect with friends and individuals
with similar interests.
</p><p>
Facebook has become enormously popular in the last few years,
particularly among US university students. But in mid-2007,
Facebook unveiled an API that was far beyond what most other sites
were doing. This API did not make it particularly easy to retrieve
data from Facebook or to perform searches against its extremely
large database. Rather, it was designed to let individual developers
create new applications that could fit into Facebook's existing site.
</p><p>
If the first few months are any indication, Facebook's application
platform has been a wild success. According to a report published by
O'Reilly Radar in October 2007, more than 4,000 applications for Facebook
have been released since the platform was first unveiled. Some
applications have become staggeringly popular; the report estimates
that these applications get more than 30 million page views per day,
which works out to more than 2% of all Facebook page views.
</p><p>
Other social-networking sites have realized that they must respond in
kind. Both LinkedIn and MySpace are (at the time of this writing) working on
APIs of their own. But, it remains to be seen if their APIs will
provide the deep integration that Facebook is offering. Granted, not
every Facebook application is good, and many of them are getting far
fewer than the millions of users enjoyed by the top tier.
</p><p>
Whether Facebook turns out to prevail in the social-networking wars is
an interesting topic to debate, and it is being discussed at length by
business reporters and those interested in what's known as Web 2.0.
What's more interesting to us, as Web/database developers, is the fact
that Facebook has provided programmers with an enormous opportunity,
making it possible for us to add our own applications to their site.
</p><p>
Last month, we created a simple &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; application that lived
on our own server and was powered by Ruby on Rails. But, this
application wasn't designed to be served up on its own. Rather, it
is meant to be invoked via Facebook. When people go to the URL
http://apps.facebook.com/rmlljatf,
they will stay on Facebook, with the look and feel of the page
remaining that of Facebook. But the contents of that page&mdash;currently,
nothing more than &ldquo;Hello from Facebook&rdquo;&mdash;are 
generated dynamically by a Rails application sitting on my server,
atf.lerner.co.il. Think of Facebook as a giant, smart proxy
server, transparently passing certain HTTP requests to my server
whenever someone tries my application.
</p><p>
This month, I explain how Facebook lets us do much more than display
&ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; messages. I show how
we can retrieve and display information from Facebook and take
an initial look at how we can use Facebook's FBML markup languages.
</p><p>
I also continue to develop the application I created last
month&mdash;named rmlljatf&mdash;which I created using the Ruby on Rails
framework in general and the RFacebook plugin for Rails in
particular. See Resources for information on
where to obtain this software.

Getting Information from fbsession</h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we saw how we could create a very simple &ldquo;Hello,
world&rdquo;
application using Ruby on Rails and RFacebook. However, it's not that
exciting to produce such output. For example, how do we know that the
person is really logged in to Facebook? (Beyond the fact that the page
is rendered under the apps.facebook.com hostname and has the
look and feel of the Facebook page, that is.) And, where are all the
nifty, cool Facebook features we have come to expect, which we
would expect to use from within a Facebook application?
</p><p>
If this were a normal Web/database application, we simply
would create an SQL query, retrieve information about the current user from
the database and display it. For example, if we were interested in
retrieving a list of the current user's friends, we would write
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT F.friend_two_id, P.first_name, P.last_name
  FROM Friends F, People P
WHERE F.friend_one_id = 123
    AND F.friend_two_id = P.id
</pre>
</p><p>
The above, of course, assumes that we have two tables. The first
table is named People, in which each person has an ID, a first name
and a last name. The second table is named Friends, and it indicates who
is friends with whom; each friendship is indicated with the
friend_one_id and friend_two_id columns, each of which is a foreign
key to People.id. Modeling friends in this way requires two rows for
each friendship. This might not be the best way to keep track of
links, but it reduces the complexity of the logic in SQL queries.
</p><p>
If we were using a straight Rails application, we could eliminate the
SQL altogether, relying on the automatic way in which Rails retrieves
such data. For example, we could say:

<pre     class="programlisting">

@friends = @person.friends

</pre>
</p><p>
This automatically would fire off an SQL query not unlike the one we
saw above, albeit behind the scenes. The advantage is not only that
we get to write (and read and debug) less code, but also that we can think
at a higher level of abstraction, looking at our users in terms of
people and links, rather than rows, columns and tables.
</p><p>
Either of these techniques would work fine with Facebook, except for
one little problem: we don't have access to the database. Rather, we
have to ask Facebook for data, authenticating ourselves as a
particular user within a particular application. Only after we have
told Facebook who we are can we gain access to the data. Moreover,
Facebook makes it easy for users to share only particular pieces of
information with third-party applications (and other users), so you
cannot be sure you will have access to everything.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100c580.0x1104d40"></a>
fbsession</h2></div></div><p>
Much of the Facebook developer documentation has to do with the ways
in which you can retrieve information about current users and their
friends. However, we will ignore that for now, because
RFacebook pulls all of that together, as well as the authentication
tokens that you need, into a single fbsession function. For
example, you can write:

<pre     class="programlisting">

@friend_uids = fbsession.friends_get.uid_list

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100c580.0x1104ea0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and @friend_uids will be populated with a list of the user IDs for the
current user's friends. We even can display this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

@friend_uids = fbsession.friends_get.uid_list
render :text =&gt; "&lt;p&gt;#{@friend_uids.join(', ')}&lt;/p&gt;"
return

</pre>
</p><p>
To review, fbsession is our handle into the Facebook API.
fbsession.friends_get is not merely an array of friends; rather, it is
an object of type Facepricot. If this seems like an odd name to
you, consider that a popular XML-parsing tool for Ruby is called
Hpricot. As you can imagine, Facepricot is a Facebook-specific
extension of Hpricot, which allows you to navigate through the
response as if it were an Hpricot document or use Facebook-specific
shortcuts. One such shortcut is seen above, as the uid_list method.
Although we also could have retrieved the list of friend uids using
Hpricot, this is more natural, as well as more readable and terse.
</p><p>
Indeed, we also could have written the above code as:

<pre     class="programlisting">

@friend_uids = fbsession.friends_get.search("//uid").map{|xmlnode|
xmlnode.inner_html}
render :text =&gt; @friend_uids.join(', ')
return

</pre>
</p><p>
But, unless you're doing something particularly complicated, you
probably don't want to that.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100c580.0x1105160"></a>
Displaying Friends</h2></div></div><p>
Once we have retrieved the user's friends' uids, we can ask Facebook
to give us some information about each one, using fbsession's
users_getInfo method:

<pre     class="programlisting">

@friendsInfo =
  fbsession.users_getInfo(:uids =&gt; @friend_uids,
                          :fields =&gt; ["first_name", "last_name"])

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that we're using instance variables (names starting
with @) rather than plain-old variables. This ensures that the
variables will be visible within our views. For example, we could
render the above within our controller:

<pre     class="programlisting">

@friends_info =
  fbsession.users_getInfo(:uids =&gt; @friend_uids,
                          :fields =&gt; ["first_name", "last_name"])

output = ""
@friends_info.user_list.each do |friend|
  output &lt;&lt; "&lt;p&gt;#{friend.first_name} #{friend.last_name}&lt;/p&gt;\n"
end

render :text =&gt; output
return

</pre>
</p><p>
In the first line, we use fbsession.users_getInfo to invoke the
getInfo method from the Facebook API. (Indeed, fbsession provides
us with an interface to the entire Facebook API, albeit with some
character translation along the way.) users_getInfo takes two
parameters: a list of user IDs about which to retrieve information
and then the fields we want to retrieve about them.
</p><p>
For example, perhaps we want to find out whether each of our friends
is male or female, as well as how many messages they have on their
wall. We can do this by modifying our users_getInfo query, as well
as by changing our output:


<pre     class="programlisting">

@friends_info =
  fbsession.users_getInfo(:uids =&gt; @friend_uids,
                          :fields =&gt; ["first_name", "last_name",
                                      "sex", "wall_count"])

output = ""
@friends_info.user_list.each do |friend|
  output &lt;&lt; "&lt;p&gt;#{friend.first_name} #{friend.last_name}
(#{friend.sex}), with #{friend.wall_count} hits on their wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n"
end

render :text =&gt; output
return

</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, this produces a list of our friends, along with their
stated sex and the number of hits on their wall. Behind the scenes,
our call to users_getInfo is sending a request to Facebook's servers.
Facebook authenticates our request and then sends a response. Although
the response is in XML, the Facepricot object provides us with some
convenience functions that make it easy to work with what it provides.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x100c580.0x1105528"></a>
A Nicer Display</h2></div></div><p>
The above code might work, but you would be hard-pressed to say that
it was elegant. If nothing else, Rails programmers are consistent
about their praise for the MVC paradigm in Web development. That is,
you want to have a clear separation between the back-end data model,
the controller that handles business logic and the way in which
displayed items are rendered on the user's view or screen.
</p><p>
Luckily, it's easy to modify the way in which these things are
displayed. Rather than collecting the textual output in a variable
(named output in our above examples), we can define our entire
method as:


<pre     class="programlisting">

def facebook
  @friend_uids = fbsession.friends_get.uid_list

  @friends_info =
    fbsession.users_getInfo(:uids =&gt; @friend_uids,
                            :fields =&gt; ["first_name", "last_name",
                                        "sex", "wall_count"])

end

</pre>
</p><p>
We then create (or modify, if you still have your view from last
time) facebook.rhtml, which looks like:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% @friends_info.user_list.each do |userInfo| %&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= userInfo.first_name %&gt; &lt;%= userInfo.last_name %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, we iterate through each element in our list of
friends, pulling out their names. We can use all the information
we have captured, not just the names:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% @friends_info.user_list.each do |userInfo| %&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;%= userInfo.first_name %&gt; &lt;%= userInfo.last_name %&gt; (&lt;%=
userInfo.sex %&gt;), wall count &lt;%= userInfo.wall_count %&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
But, wait one moment&mdash;we can do even better than this! Because we
are rendering things within Facebook, we can take advantage of FBML,
the Facebook Markup Language. FBML is an extended subset of HTML,
which is a fancy way of saying that it adds some Facebook-specific
tags while removing some standard HTML tags. In any event, it allows
us to create a variety of lists, interfaces and functionality that
are common to Facebook applications and include them in our
applications. For example, let's change our view to the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% @friends_info.user_list.each do |userInfo| %&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;fb:name uid="&lt;%= userInfo.uid -%&gt;" target="_blank"
/&gt;&lt;fb:profile-pic\
 uid="&lt;%= userInfo.uid -%&gt;" linked="true" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now we're iterating over the same list. But, instead of rendering
things directly from Ruby, we're using Ruby to pass the friend's user
ID to FBML tags. Each FBML tag takes one or more arguments, passed in
the form of HTML/XML attributes. In this case, we have used two FBML
tags: fb:name, which displays a user's name, and fb:profile-pic,
which displays the user's picture.
</p><p>
As you can see, we have passed each tag the uid attribute, then
used some rhtml to bring in the user's ID. We also have passed the
linked attribute to indicate that the picture should be a link to
the user's profile. (The name is linked to the profile by default, so
we don't need to say anything about that.) I have been quite
impressed by the number and types of attributes that Facebook's
developer API provides, going so far as to let us indicate whether we want
to have the name rendered in the possessive form.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Facebook has provided application developers with a rich and
interesting API that goes far beyond retrieving and storing data. It
allows us to create applications that truly do sit within Facebook.
Next month, we'll look at how we can have a Facebook application that
stores its own data and integrates that data along with the
user's Facebook profile.

Facebook developer information is at
<a href="http://developers.facebook.com" target="_self">developers.facebook.com</a>. This includes documentation,
a wiki and many code examples. One article on the wiki specifically
addresses Ruby development:

Ruby on Rails can be downloaded from <a href="http://rubyonrails.com" target="_self">rubyonrails.com</a>. Of
course, Rails is written in the Ruby language, which is almost
certainly included in your distribution, and it also can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org" target="_self">www.ruby-lang.org</a>.
</p><p>
The RFacebook gem for Ruby and the companion RFacebook plugin for
Rails developers can be retrieved from
<a href="http://rfacebook.rubyforge.org" target="_self">rfacebook.rubyforge.org</a>.
</p><p>
Hpricot, written by the prolific Ruby programmer &ldquo;why the lucky
stiff&rdquo;, is at <a href="http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot" target="_self">code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot</a>. I have
found it to be useful in many Ruby programs I've written, but it is
especially useful in the context of RFacebook, given the central role
of XML and the Facepricot extension.
</p><p>
Chad Fowler, a well-known Ruby developer, has developed a
different Rails plugin (Facebooker) for working with Facebook. You
can download the code, as well as learn more about the design
principles behind his plugin, at

</p><p>
Finally, O'Reilly Media published a 30-page report in October 2007
describing the Facebook application platform. The report is meant for
managers and marketing people, but even programmers can learn something
from this (admittedly expensive) report, which describes the number of
applications that have been deployed, as well as the types of things
people are doing. Programmers won't learn enough from this for it
to be worth buying, but it might well be worth finding and reading a
copy that a more business-oriented friend has bought.
