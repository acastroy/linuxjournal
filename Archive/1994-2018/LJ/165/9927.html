Linux, free software and open source may be &ldquo;generic&rdquo;. But, that's why you
need it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1922580.0x1a1a2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The GNU Project has been around since 1983, Linux since 1991,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>
since 1994 and the Open Source Initiative since 1998. That means some of
us been explaining this stuff for going on a quarter century&mdash;or more, in
some cases.
</p><p>
Yet, we're not being clear. What's obvious to us is still not apparent to
others, even after years of explaining what it's all about. Hardly a week
goes by when I don't find myself explaining, for example:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Free software and open source are not just ways to cheap out.
</p></li><li><p>
Asking &ldquo;How do you make money with it?&rdquo; is the wrong question.
</p></li><li><p>
Much more money is made by using Linux than by selling it. 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
It helps to use the Net as an example, because it's more than something
you've gotta have; it's foundational.
</p><p>
But Linux, free software and open source aren't there yet. They've
&ldquo;won&rdquo; in
many cases, but their advantages are plain only to technologists, and far
from all of those. Those of us who understand it are still being opaque to
high-level decision-makers.
</p><p>
Last October the on-line magazine <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baseline</em></span> ran a story
titled &ldquo;CIOs Told to
Make Conspicuous Contribution to Revenue&rdquo;. It was a report from the Gartner
Symposium/ITxpo in Orlando. The goal, they were told, was to &ldquo;try to define
IT as an integral part of the business&rdquo;, and &ldquo;aligned with initiatives that
really make a difference for the business&rdquo;. Said Mark P. McDonald, group
Vice President for Gartner's executive programs, &ldquo;In 2008, your goal should
be to stamp out generic IT.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The problem word, of course, is generic. Linux is generic. Free software
and open-source building materials are all generic. They aren't no-names,
but they are, by intention, commodities. Yet common wisdom says that if you
want something to be known, to be unique, to be valuable, it can't be
generic.
</p><p>
Linux and the whole FOSS portfolio, now numbering several hundred thousand
code bases, are both generic <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> valuable. They just don't have a value
that's made to sell. As Eric S. Raymond pointed out long ago, open-source
code has enormous &ldquo;use value&rdquo;. Thanks to that use value, Google can exist.
Amazon can exist. The Net itself can exist.
</p><p>
What's missing is the connection between pure use value and all kinds of
sale value. That's what we've been calling the because effect. You make
money because of free and open code, not just with it.
</p><p>
I suggest the relationship here is between foundations and the structures
that rest on them. You can talk about architecture and design all day, but
none of it will be worth anything if it doesn't sit on a strong foundation.
This fact does not diminish the importance of foundations. Quite the
opposite. Foundations are, in nearly all cases, 100% useful and 0% flashy.
Their job is not to augment the building, but rather to augment the
geology below it.
</p><p>
Now, let's go back to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baseline</em></span>'s coverage of the Gartner event where CIOs
were being warned about &ldquo;generic IT&rdquo;. A companion piece,
titled &ldquo;The 10
Most Important Technology Areas for 2008, Per Gartner&rdquo;, outlines a pile of
nongeneric things IT can do to win the hearts and minds on companies' top
floors and corner offices. Among them are &ldquo;social software&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Web platform
and Web-oriented architecture&rdquo;, &ldquo;metadata management&rdquo;
and &ldquo;green IT&rdquo;. All
of those are bound to deploy easier, and work better, if they're built on
free and open foundations.
</p><p>
Back in the November 1999 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, I wrote a column titled
&ldquo;Hacking an Industry&rdquo;. Here's an excerpt, from a section where I was
talking about e-commerce:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Now think about the infrastructure involved here....&ldquo;Huge&rdquo; doesn't
cover it. What's it going to take to build out the infrastructure behind
all that? We know it'll take two things for sure: Linux and Apache&mdash;two
well-proven kinds of building material. Of course, Windows 2000 will be
involved too. There are just too many people already constructing this new
skyline with Microsoft tools and building materials. The difference is that
the builders themselves help improve Linux, Apache and other open-source
products. They can't do the same for Microsoft.
</p><p>
One developer put it to me this way: &ldquo;When I'm building a skyscraper, I
want to know there's rebar in the concrete. With Linux, I know. With
Microsoft, I don't. In fact, NT's memory leaks prove to me there isn't
rebar in there. Since I have to work with NT for political reasons, I just
cope with it. But I know if we could see the source, we could probably fix
the problem pretty fast.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
More than eight years later, IT's foundations include a lot more than Linux
and Apache. But they still don't show off. They just support everything.
Yet this can't be obvious if people still want to burden foundations with
making money or &ldquo;contributing to revenue&rdquo;.
</p><p>
So the real challenge here is understanding infrastructure&mdash;of knowing,
clearly, what's foundational and what isn't. Even with the Net, which has
the clearest pure use value on Earth, most of us still don't grok that it's
a pure utility like water, roads and waste treatment. Yes, it has costs,
but its use value verges on the absolute: you have to have it.
</p><p>
So that's the point. Running your IT on FOSS is as necessary as erecting
your buildings on a solid foundation. You can find that out now or later,
when you have to build your IT architecture all over again.
