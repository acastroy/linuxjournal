<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #185, September 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Rik van Riel</b></span> has doubled and doubled again
the amount of <span   class="bold"><b>RAM</b></span> that can
be directly addressed in the x86 64-bit architecture. The previous
limit had been 2<sup  >44</sup> bytes, or more than 17
terabytes. The new limit is 2<sup  >46</sup>
bytes, or more than 70 terabytes.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>Linux Pulse Per Second</b></span> (LinuxPPS)
Project has had to
reset and restart, when <span   class="bold"><b>Udo van den Heuvel</b></span> asked why the code hadn't
been accepted, and neither <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span>
nor <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> could remember
any of the objections anyone had against it. They both recommended
resubmitting the patches, which at the very least would get the folks
who still had problems with the code to speak up again. LinuxPPS is a
project to provide a character-device-based API for communication
between kernel space and userspace. <span   class="bold"><b>Rudolfo
Giometti</b></span> took Alan and
Andrew's advice a couple weeks later, submitting the core LinuxPPS
code for inclusion&mdash;the idea being to get everyone signed off on the
basic features before introducing any code that might be more
controversial. He also pointed out that all previous objections had
been fixed, or that the objectors already had agreed the
fix could wait. So, it looks like a good thing that Udo asked about
this initially, or the perfectly good code might be lingering
still.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>XCEP motherboards</b></span> from <span   class="bold"><b>IskraTel</b></span> now are supported in Linux, which
is cool, because that motherboard is used in many particle
accelerators throughout the world. <span   class="bold"><b>Michael
Abbot</b></span> recently submitted
patches adding this architecture, which runs an ARM XScale PXA255 CPU.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>DebugFS</b></span> soon may be configurable in much
more powerful ways. <span   class="bold"><b>Steven
Rostedt</b></span> has added a feature to enable tracing events defined in a
whole directory tree. The previous version required that each event be
enabled individually in its own directory. The current version
recurses through all child directories, but it also allows users to
chop off branches of that directory tree easily if they so desire.
What's the cost of all this power? It's no longer easy to identify
which tracing events are enabled and which are not, because an event
may be controlled by configurations elsewhere in the directory tree.
But, as Steven said during the discussion, the information is all
there, and a script easily could identify all configured events. As
far as the debate went, no one seemed to feel the cons outweighed the
pros, so this probably will be accepted into the kernel in the near
future.
</p><p>
One thing that doesn't happen often is a hardware vendor asking for
advice from the Linux community about how to code its drivers. But,
<span   class="bold"><b>Atul Mukker</b></span> from <span   class="bold"><b>LSI
Corporation</b></span> recently did exactly that. He said
LSI wanted to take a whole new approach to driver writing, in which
it had operating-system-independent code at the core, with a thin
layer of support for Linux, Windows and so on. And, he just wanted to
know if anyone had any advice. Turns out several folks did&mdash;one of the
main ones being <span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Garzik</b></span>. Jeff
recommended <span   class="bold"><b>Intel's networking
drivers</b></span> as excellent examples of good practice. He suggested
modularizing the code so that each piece of hardware would have its
own codebase, which also could be kept free of any
operating-system-specific code. He also recommended keeping
general-purpose code out of the driver entirely, where other drivers
could use it more easily. The <span   class="bold"><b>Application Binary
Interface</b></span> (ABI), Jeff
said, also should remain consistent with other drivers already in the
kernel. Any feature similar to something found elsewhere should
imitate that other interface. Any features that were unique, on the
other hand, could create whatever interface seemed best.

Moonlight is an open-source implementation of
Microsoft's Silverlight.
In case you're not familiar with Silverlight, it's a
Web browser plugin that runs rich Internet applications.
It provides features such as animation, audio/video playback
and vector graphics.
</p><p>
Moonlight programming is done with any of the languages
compatible with the Mono runtime environment.
Among many others, these languages include C#, VB.NET and Python.
Mono, of course, is a multiplatform implementation of ECMA's
Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), aka the .NET environment.
</p><p>
A technical collaboration deal between Novell and Microsoft 
has provided Moonlight with access to Silverlight test suites
and gives Moonlight users access to licensed media codecs
for video and audio.
Moonlight currently supplies stable support for Silverlight 1.0
and Alpha support for Silverlight 2.0.

<h2 class="title">Hardware Requirements: None</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #185, September 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In two days, I'll be the proud owner of a Kindle DX. That may seem a
bit odd, considering how much I despise DRM. The real selling point for
me, however, is that it will read PDF files natively, and in full size.
As I was looking for the system requirements for the Kindle DX (naively
thinking it might sport Linux support), I was amused to see the hardware
requirements listed: none.
</p><p>
The Kindle is designed as a self-contained piece of hardware, never
needing to connect to a computer. Because it actually mounts as a
USB removable device, it will work just fine under Linux. But, more
interesting for me is that it never needs to sync at all. And, that got
me thinking about my other electronic devices. I have two smartphones
that I never connect to a computer. They both have the ability to sync
with a computer, but because they're connected to the Internet, I never
have had the need to connect them directly to a computer.
</p><p>
Will hardware compatibility fade away into the past? It wouldn't be a bad
thing, unless, of course, proprietary hardware drivers are replaced with
proprietary network protocols. Luckily, Linux is king on the Internet,
so we're much more likely to keep standards in place on-line than in the
hands of Windows-savvy developers.
</p><p>
My Kindle DX might have the taint of DRM, but thankfully, it also has
support for non-DRM files as well. Although it has support for the non-free
Windows operating system, it also supports Linux. And heck, it will run
just fine all by itself. I figure that's because it's running Linux as
its underlying OS.

<h2 class="title">Mac OS X, It's Not Linux, but It's Close</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #185, September 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In
the past, the Mac OS was a fairly unique entity, not having
much in common with other OSes, such as Windows or UNIX, which
made cross-platform work a bit convoluted.
However, the advent of the latest incarnation of the Mac OS, called OS X or Darwin,
provides a very comfortable alternative for Linux geeks. Because
Darwin is based on BSD UNIX, it is possible to use POSIX-compliant applications on the Mac. 
</p><p>
Apple provides a package called Xcode on its developer site.
Xcode has the necessary tools for compiling programs on the Mac, and
it
includes a nice graphical IDE and lots of examples for developing 
applications for OS X. Xcode
is based on the GNU toolset, providing tools like gcc, libtool, make and so
on. That means, with Xcode, most command-line applications can be
compiled and run on the Mac. So, a simple little hello world program:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main (int argc, char **argv) {
  printf("Hello World\n");
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
compiles fine with gcc, giving you an executable that prints out &ldquo;Hello
World&rdquo; on the command line. Basically, anything that is POSIX-compliant
should compile and run with no issues.
</p><p>
Getting graphical programs to run can be a bit more
involved. Mac OS X does provide an X server and all the standard
development libraries you would need for a pure X11 application,
like Xlib. However, none of the other standard libraries, like GTK or Qt,
are available by default. You have to download,
compile and install them yourself,
which works fairly well, but
you have to choose the correct configuration options and collect all
the required dependencies. But, you shouldn't need to
go through so much pain. Two projects in active development
provide some form of package management for GNU software: Fink
and MacPorts. Using these, getting and installing GNU software is
as easy to do as it is with most Linux distros.
</p><p>
The Fink Project started in 2001 and is based on the Debian package
management system, so you can use the Debian package tools
like dpkg, dselect and apt-get, making it familiar for Debian-based
distro users. Once the base installation is
done, you can start to install packages. If you like a text-based manager,
use dselect (Figure 1). If you prefer a graphical manager instead,
use the following command to get synaptic (Figure 2):

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install synaptic
</pre>
</p><p>
Using these applications, you can install many
of the packages you are familiar with in Linux. The package count, at the
time of
this writing, is 10,872.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10532macf1.large.jpg"><img src="10532macf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 2. synaptic Package Manager
</p></div></div><p>
However, not all packages are available
as a binary install using these tools. For that class of packages,
Fink installs them directly from source, compiling and installing
on your Mac. So, for example, if you want to install gramps and
do some genealogy work, execute the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo fink install gramps
</pre>
</p><p>
Even installing from source, Fink deals well with dependency issues,
because it still is based on the Debian package management system.
</p><p>
The MacPorts Project started in 2002 and models
itself after the BSD port packaging system. Thus, you use the
command to manage the packages on your system. Once you have done
the base install, you can install other software packages simply
by running the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo port install stellarium
</pre>
</p><p>
Several graphical interfaces are available as well, such as
Porticus. However, those typically are independent projects, as opposed to
the Debian tools available in Fink. As such, their development cycle and
behavior tend to be a bit more erratic and unstable than the older and
more mature Debian tools. But still, they may be exactly what you're
looking for if you prefer a graphical interface. Like the Fink Project,
both binary packages and source packages are available. There are 5,829
packages available in the MacPorts Project.
</p><p>
Both projects provide access to the full wealth of open-source applications
that has been available to Linux users, and the
number of packages provided by both projects continues to grow.
</p><p>
Once you have one, or both, of these projects installed (they will coexist 
on your system), you will have all the tools
necessary to do your own code development. I have used anjuta (Figure
3) on my MacBook to develop some small GNOME applications. These compile
and run equally well on my MacBook and my Netbook running Ubuntu. Although
there isn't binary compatibility between OS X and Linux, with source
compatibility, it is (at least in theory) simply a matter of recompiling for the other system.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10532macf3.large.jpg"><img src="10532macf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Anjuta IDE
</p></div></div><p>
Running Mac OS X code on Linux is not as easy as running Linux code on Mac OS X. The real stumbling block
is the graphical interface called Quartz on the Mac OS. 
Although the kernel and most
of the command-line tools have been released as open-source software,
Quartz still is closed. At the time of this writing, I could
not find any references to a reverse-engineered, open-source replacement
for Quartz. So the only option available is running OS X inside a virtual
machine. Although this is not technically running Mac applications on Linux,
it does provide the ability to run OS X on a Linux box.

<h2 class="title">Why Buy a $350 Thin Client?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #185, September 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
On August 10, 2009, I'll be at a conference in Troy, Michigan, put on by the
LTSP (Linux Terminal Server Project, <a href="http://www.ltsp.org" target="_self">www.ltsp.org</a>)
crew and their
commercial company (<a href="http://www.disklessworkstations.com" target="_self">www.disklessworkstations.com</a>). The mini-conference is
geared toward people considering thin-client computing for their network.
My talk will be targeting education, as that's where I have the most
experience.

</p><p>
One of the issues network administrators need to sort out is whether
a decent thin client, which costs around $350, is worth the money
when full-blown desktops can be purchased for a similar investment.
As with most good questions, there's really not only one answer.
Thankfully, LTSP is very flexible with the clients it supports, so whatever
avenue is chosen, it usually works well. Some of the advantages of
actual thin-client devices are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Setup time is almost zero. The thin clients are designed to be
unboxed and turned on.
</p></li><li><p>
Because modern thin clients have no moving parts, they very seldom break
down and tend to use much less electricity compared to desktop machines.
</p></li><li><p>
Top-of-the-line thin clients have sufficient specs to support locally
running applications, which takes load off the server without sacrificing
ease of installation.
</p></li><li><p>
They look great.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
There are some advantages to using full desktop machines as thin clients
too, and it's possible they will be the better solution for a given
install:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Older desktops often can be revitalized as thin clients. Although a
500MHz computer is too slow to be a decent workstation, it can make a
very viable thin client.
</p></li><li><p>
Netbooks like the Eee PC can be used as thin clients and then used
as notebook computers on the go. It makes for a slightly inconvenient
desktop setup, but if mobility is important, it might be ideal for some
situations.
</p></li><li><p>
It's easy to get older computers for free. Even with the disadvantages
that come with using old hardware, it's hard to beat free.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Thankfully, with the flexibility of LTSP, any combination of thin clients
can coexist in the same network. If you're looking for a great way to
manage lots of client computers, the Linux Terminal Server Project might
be exactly what you need. I know I couldn't do my job without it.

A few months back, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> had a live streaming show called,
&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Live&rdquo;. It aired once a week and streamed via ustream.tv.
One of the frustrating things about running the show was that it was
very difficult to get the &ldquo;studio&rdquo; feel using Linux. As it happened,
we ended up using a Macintosh computer and the freeware CamTwist
in order to embed graphics, guest hosts and text.

</p><p>
If we ever resurrect the live show, now we'll be able to stream from our
dearly beloved Linux, thanks to the open-source project, WebcamStudio
(<a href="http://webcamstudio.sourceforge.net" target="_self">webcamstudio.sourceforge.net</a>). WebcamStudio allows Linux
users to stream Webcams, graphics, text and much more to sites like
ustream.tv. If you've ever wanted to try your hand at a live show, be sure to check it out.

As we read this month's coverage of cross-platform development, I
thought I'd weigh in on the Web development end of things. While I
work toward a new-and-improved iteration of LinuxJournal.com, I must
constantly consider the needs of users with widely varying operating
system and browser configurations. LinuxJournal.com visitors are a
technologically diverse bunch. As you might expect, the majority of
our Web visitors view LinuxJournal.com with Firefox, but what may
surprise you is that a slight majority of those Firefox users are
browsing from a Windows machine. Linux and Firefox users are nipping
at their heels though. What also may surprise you is the percentage
of visitors browsing with some version of Internet Explorer. Granted,
that percentage has decreased during the last couple years, but the
most recent numbers show about 20% of traffic coming from IE users,
down from around 30% a year ago. Other browsers like Chrome, Opera
and Safari have a small but important constituent as well, which makes
my job just a little more interesting. So, to all of you visiting us
from a less-used browser, I am doing my very best to give you the
same great experience as the Firefox majority, and to all of those
using IE, well, you may drive me to drink. I still welcome you
though, and I will do my best to accommodate!
