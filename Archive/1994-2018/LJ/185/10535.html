New to testing? Just want an easier time with Test::Unit? Shoulda is
the answer.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1518358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The past few months, I've been looking at a number of tools
that make it easier for Ruby on Rails developers to improve the
reliability of their software using automated testing. Even if you
don't fully subscribe to the notion of test-driven development (TDD)
or its cousin, behavior-driven development (BDD), the fact that Rails
makes it so easy to test each part of your code makes it less likely
that foolish mistakes will creep into your applications.
</p><p>
By default, Rails comes with Test::Unit, a test suite that makes it
possible, and even easy, to check your code. Coupled with the test
classes that come with actionpage, one of the core Ruby gems that
comes with Rails, you can create a comprehensive test suite at the
unit (model), functional (controller) and integration
(cross-controller) levels. If you have a comprehensive test
suite, you easily will detect, and understand the implications
of, changes you make to the code that break the test.
</p><p>
That said, Test::Unit sometimes can be a bit verbose and repetitive.
If you are writing unit tests, and you want to make sure that a
particular attribute has been tested completely, it would be nice to
be able to express a number of test cases quickly and tersely. Tests
can function, in many ways, as a type of specification (as I will explain 
when we get to RSpec and Cucumber in coming months), and the easier it
is to read these specifications, the less likely odd behavior is to
slip through the cracks. It also goes without saying that the easier
it is to write tests, and particularly comprehensive tests, the more
likely you are to write them.
</p><p>
This is why Shoulda, a set of macros that work with Test::Unit, has
become popular among Ruby developers in general and Rails
developers in particular. Shoulda, developed by Tammer Saleh, a
programmer who works for the Thoughtbot consulting company in Boston,
is a set of macros that makes it easier to write tests with Test::Unit,
as well as easier to read them. I have begun to use Shoulda with
projects that I test with Test::Unit and have found it to be quite
enjoyable.
</p><p>
This month, I take a look at Shoulda, and how you can integrate its
macros into the tests you write in a Rails application. I explain
how Shoulda divides tests into contexts, allowing you to group
tests together even within a single file. I also describe how
Shoulda's various macros make it easy to run a number of tests using a
single readable line.
</p><p>
I should note that although Shoulda originally was designed to be used
with Test::Unit and to provide something of an RSpec-like environment
for Test::Unit users, it adds a growing amount of support for
RSpec as well. Even if you use RSpec, you might want to consider
using Shoulda along with your standard RSpec tests (or specs). I
haven't looked at the combination for my own work, but it might be
appropriate for what you're doing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1518720"></a>
Installation and Basic Use</h2></div></div><p>
Shoulda comes packaged as a Ruby gem, and can be installed as:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo gem install thoughtbot-shoulda --source=http://gems.github.com
</pre>
</p><p>
Earlier versions of Shoulda came packaged under a slightly different
name (Shoulda, rather than thoughtbot-shoulda). It also
is possible to install Shoulda as a Rails plugin; in this article, I
assume that you have installed the gem version.
</p><p>
You can incorporate the gem in your configuration file,
config/environment.rb:

<pre     class="programlisting">
config.gem "thoughtbot-shoulda", :lib =&gt; "shoulda", 
 &#8618;:source =&gt; "http://gems.github.com"
</pre>
</p><p>
With that in place, your Rails application either will run with
Shoulda in place, or it will fail to load, complaining that the gem
has not been installed. In one of my favorite Rails functions, you
then can type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake gems:install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1518a90"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and your Rails application will examine its list of required gems,
download those that are not yet on the system and install them in the
appropriate places.
</p><p>
Let's assume you have created a simple Rails application that
contains a single model that describes people. You can create it in
the following way:


<pre     class="programlisting">
rails simple
cd simple
./script/generate model Person firstname:text lastname:text
 &#8618;birthdate:date grade_in_school:integer phone_number:text 
 &#8618;email_address:text
rake db:migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, you now have a simple Rails application (using the
built-in default database, SQLite) with a single model defined. By
creating your model with a generator, you get the following simple unit
test file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

require 'test_helper'

class PersonTest &lt; ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # Replace this with your real tests.
  test "the truth" do
    assert true
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
True, you can invoke <tt  >rake test</tt> on this, and the
tests will succeed,
but that's because the test is completely empty. You can write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rake test:units
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1518e58"></a></h2></div></div><p>
but the success won't really tell you much, other than the fact that you
need to write some tests.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1518f60"></a>
Testing with and without Shoulda</h2></div></div><p>
Now comes the hard part. What sorts of tests do
you want to write?
Well, that depends on the constraints you have put on your model,
typically by using ActiveRecord validations.
</p><p>
Specifically, you presumably will want to make sure that the people
have a first and last name, and that their grade in school (for the
purposes of demonstrating some additional testing) is greater than 0
and less than 13. You will want to make sure that the person's
birth date is in the past. You also will want to make sure that every
e-mail address in the system is unique to avoid having more
than one person with the same e-mail address.
</p><p>
In the model file itself, the validations will look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :firstname, :lastname, :email_address
  validates_uniqueness_of :email_address
  validates_numericality_of :grade_in_school, 
  &#8618;:greater_than_or_equal_to =&gt; 0, :less_than_or_equal_to =&gt; 13
end
</pre>
</p><p>
If you simply were using Test::Unit, you probably would want to
test each of these validations. This has less to do with testing the
validations and more to do with ensuring that your code meets the
specifications you have laid out. (If tests were only a means of
checking the correctness of your code, you could make a pretty
good argument against tests for these validations, because ActiveRecord
already has a fairly extensive test suite.)
</p><p>
If you were to try to test this line:


<pre     class="programlisting">
validates_presence_of :firstname, :lastname, :email_address
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1519328"></a></h2></div></div><p>
you would need to iterate over each of the three fields that are
mentioned, checking to see whether the model would be valid if one of
these were missing. See Listing 1 for an example of what person_test.rb,
the file that contains the unit tests for the Person object, would
look like just to test the need for each of those.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1519488"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. person_test.rb</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

require 'test_helper'

class PersonTest &lt; ActiveSupport::TestCase
 # Replace this with your real tests.
 test "working person" do
   person = Person.new(:firstname =&gt; 'First',
                       :lastname =&gt; 'Last',
                       :email_address =&gt; 'foo@example.com',
                       :grade_in_school =&gt; 10)
   assert person.valid?
 end

 test "person must have first name" do
   person = Person.new(:firstname =&gt; '',
                       :lastname =&gt; 'Last',
                       :email_address =&gt; 'foo@example.com',
                       :grade_in_school =&gt; 10)
   assert !person.valid?
 end

 test "person must have last name" do
   person = Person.new(:firstname =&gt; 'First',
                       :lastname =&gt; '',
                       :email_address =&gt; 'foo@example.com',
                       :grade_in_school =&gt; 10)
   assert !person.valid?
 end

 test "person must have e-mail address" do
   person = Person.new(:firstname =&gt; 'First',
                       :lastname =&gt; 'Last',
                       :email_address =&gt; '',
                       :grade_in_school =&gt; 10)
   assert !person.valid?
 end
end

</pre></div><p>
But, you lose something in creating these verbose tests. Instead of
functioning as a checkup on your code, and as a specification of sorts
for what you intend to do, these tests become verbose, repetitive and
difficult to read.
</p><p>
With Shoulda installed, you now can remove all of the test cases that
are shown in Listing 1, replacing them with one simple invocation:


<pre     class="programlisting">
should_validate_presence_of :firstname, :lastname, :email_address
</pre>
</p><p>
Shoulda comes with a large number of macros that can help you test
your ActiveRecord models in this way. For example, you can test all of
the validations defined for the Person model using Shoulda macros:


<pre     class="programlisting">
should_validate_presence_of :firstname, :lastname, :email_address
should_validate_uniqueness_of :email_address
should_validate_numericality_of :grade_in_school
should_ensure_value_in_range :grade_in_school, (1..12), 
 &#8618;:low_message =&gt; 'must be greater than or equal to 1', 
 &#8618;:high_message =&gt; 'must be less than or equal to 12'
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how the Shoulda macros' names reflect the names of the
ActiveRecord validators. This was done after Shoulda was first
released, which means that some of the documentation you see on-line
might be slightly out of date and include deprecated macro names.
</p><p>
Also notice that in order to ensure that grade_in_school is numeric
and that it is within a certain range, conditions that are set by
a single validation line might sometimes require more than one Shoulda
macro. In the particular case that I demonstrate here, there
was a surprising mismatch between the error message that Rails gave to
Shoulda and the message that Shoulda was expecting, in checking to
see that the person's grade in school is in an acceptable range. In
the end, I got around the problem by telling Shoulda what messages to
expect from Rails. Although this is more verbose than I might have liked,
it demonstrates the flexibility Shoulda offers.
</p><p>
Not surprisingly, Shoulda's authors make it possible for you to
create your own macros, much as you might create your own validator
method for an ActiveRecord class. I don't go into creating
such macros here, but it is fairly well documented,
and it means you can create a large number of tests, package them
together under a single Shoulda macro and then use those tests (via
the macro) across one or more projects.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1420580.0x1519ab8"></a>
Tests and Contexts</h2></div></div><p>
Already, you probably can see how Shoulda macros can reduce the amount
of code you need to write. Shoulda also provides an RSpec-like
facility that makes it possible to name tests using strings,
rather than method names. Granted, this is now included in
Test::Unit, albeit using a slightly different syntax. But, you can
define tests using the should keyword, rather than test, which
adds a bit of readability&mdash;especially when used in conjunction with
contexts, which I describe below.
</p><p>
Here, I create a single method in the model, fullname, which
returns the concatenation of the person's first and last name:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def fullname  # added to app/models/person.rb
  "#{firstname} #{lastname}"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, I add a new test:


<pre     class="programlisting">
should "return the concatenation of the first and last name" do
  person = Person.new(:firstname =&gt; "First",
                      :lastname =&gt; "Last",
                      :email_address =&gt; "email@example.com")

  assert_equal person.fullname, "First Last"
end
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, there's nothing wrong with this test. It not only passes, but it also
does a good job of checking that you are getting the right values back.
Maybe it's just me, but I sometimes end up with very long lists of
tests and end up categorizing them using comments inside the test
file. Shoulda provides contexts that let you group tests within your
file, using code rather than comments. It's obviously a bit silly to
have a single context and a single test, but as with many things in
the TDD/BDD world, it's worth doing things right even from the
beginning, because you know that your codebase will grow over time,
making it difficult to organize things correctly.
</p><p>
To define a context, you merely write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
context "Defined methods" do
    # "should" blocks go here
end
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, you now can rewrite the test block as:


<pre     class="programlisting">
context "Defined methods" do
    should "return the concatenation of the first and last name" do
        person = Person.new(:firstname =&gt; "First",
                      :lastname =&gt; "Last",
                      :email_address =&gt; "email@example.com")

        assert_equal person.fullname, "First Last"
    end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
With a context block and a should block, you now can read your test as,
&ldquo;Defined methods should return the concatenation of the first and last
name.&rdquo; It's not the most amazing description in the world, but it's not a bad
start. And besides, now you can add additional should blocks to
test other defined methods.
</p><p>
A context may contain other contexts, as well as should blocks. This
means that if you have a particularly complicated model you want
to test, you can have a hierarchy of contexts, with should blocks at
the bottom.
</p><p>
Moreover, using a context block means that you can write a setup
block, which defines variables and otherwise allocates resources that
will be used inside a should block. You could, for instance, now
write:


<pre     class="programlisting">
context "Defined methods" do
  setup do
    @person = Person.new(:firstname =&gt; "First",
                         :lastname =&gt; "Last",
                         :email_address =&gt; "email@example.com")

  end

  should "return the concatenation of the first and last name" do
    assert_equal @person.fullname, "#{@person.firstname}
    &#8618;#{@person.lastname}"
  end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, variables that are shared between a setup block and a
should block need to be instance variables, their names preceded
by an @ sign.
</p><p>
When a test is invoked, all the setup blocks within all of its
surrounding contexts are invoked first. This means if a should
block is within three nested contexts, and if each of those contexts
has its own setup block, all three will fire before the test is
executed.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
If you are using Test::Unit to test your Ruby on Rails application,
Shoulda is a natural fit, allowing you to write a large number of
common tests using flexible, easy-to-read macros. In this article, I
cover uses of Shoulda only for ActiveRecord models; other parts of
Shoulda work with controller tests, providing additional features that
can be of use for testers.
</p><p>
From my perspective, using Shoulda is a no-brainer. I have used it in
a number of projects already and found that it further lowered the
threshold to TDD/BDD, helping make my code that much more reliable.
If you are new to testing, Shoulda is a great way to get started,
providing an easy way to increase the stability and correctness of
your code. All in all, Shoulda is a great resource for Ruby
programmers in general and Rails programmers in particular.

The home page for Shoulda is <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda" target="_self">thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda</a>.
The documentation here is a good starting point, but you 
probably will need to play with it a bit to get the hang of
things. Even the small problem I described above, in testing the
minimum and maximum ages for a person, showed that you still
might need to poke through the documentation to understand things fully.
