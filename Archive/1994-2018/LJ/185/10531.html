GUIs? We don't need no stinkin' GUIs; we've got ImageMagick.
Work with images from the command line.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x170e580.0x18063b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've written previously about working with graphic images within shell
scripts, and obviously, it's a little bit tricky because, well, scripts
generally are strongest working with text, and you can't even see
graphics, let alone manipulate them directly. Further, let's be
candid, the suite of utilities included with a stock Linux/UNIX system
doesn't include much that help you work with graphics or image files at
all.
</p><p>
Fortunately, there's a splendid open-source package called ImageMagick,
which actually is designed to make working with image files from
the command line easy and fast. It's the smart back end to a bunch of
image utilities, and with a quick trip to
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org" target="_self">www.imagemagick.org</a>, you can download it too.
</p><p>
A couple different steps are involved in installing it, and this
time, I'm actually going to play with my Apple MacBook Pro and install
the utilities to live within the Darwin world of Mac OS X.

Installing ImageMagick in Darwin/NetBSD</h2></div></div><p>
Since 99% of the time that I'm using my Mac I am logged in as
taylor, I'm going to opt to drop the software into my own
personal bin directory rather than the more standard location of
/usr/local/src (with the binary in /usr/local/bin). It might be
that I'm a long-term UNIX geek or something, but I have my own ~/bin
(or $HOME/bin, if you prefer) directory anyway, so once the binary file was
downloaded, here's what I did:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cd ../bin
tar xvf ../Downloads/ImageMagick-i386-apple-darwin9.6.0.tar
</pre>
</p><p>
Because this particular distro includes precompiled binaries, it's as
easy as just tweaking a few environment variables to add the unpack
directory and proceed:


<pre     class="programlisting">
export MAGICK_HOME="/Users/taylor/bin/ImageMagick-6.5.2"
export PATH="$MAGICK_HOME/bin:$PATH"
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$MAGICK_HOME/lib"
</pre>
</p><p>
These are best added to your ~/.profile or ~/.cshrc (if you're using
Csh, but why would you?), so that they're invoked each and every time
you log in or, in the case of the Mac environment, spawn a new Terminal
shell.
</p><p>
It's a good idea to test the newly installed programs too. Find a .gif,
.jpg or .png file and see what the ImageMagick identify program
says.
Here's how I did that:



<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find . -name "*png" -o -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*gif"
./iphone-id.png
$ identify iphone-id.png
iphone-id.png PNG 470x118 470x118+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 12.2kb
</pre>
</p><p>
It's more useful than the file command, which reports:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ file iphone-id.png
iphone-id.png: PNG image data, 470 x 118, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
</pre>
</p><p>
Where identify really shines is with JPEG files, which the
file command can't quite seem to figure out. Why that's
true, I don't know, but that shortcoming is the main reason I have ImageMagick
installed on my system.

Doing Something Useful with ImageMagick</h2></div></div><p>
One of my hobbies is photography, and as a parent, I find that I frequently
end up as the &ldquo;official&rdquo; photographer for school events. I recently
did just that for my daughter's May Fair event, and I ended up with about
500 5&ndash;8MB image files that were great for printing (about 4,200x2,800) but
not so good for viewing on the computer screen. What I wanted to do was
create images that were approximately 1,024x800 or thereabouts, so that
they'd view at 100% on a typical computer screen, in a directory that
paralleled the original image file directory. That way, parents could view a
slideshow of the smaller images and then grab the identically named big
image if they wanted to upload it and order prints.
</p><p>
With ImageMagick, this is easy. In fact, if I wanted to use the
mogrify command, I could have very easily done everything in a
single command, but because I like obscure, complicated solutions rather than
simple, elegant ones, I decided to use the convert command
instead.
</p><p>
The challenge is that, like everything else in ImageMagick, the convert
app has a staggering number of different command flags. Type
<tt  >convert</tt>, and
you'll see what I mean.
</p><p>
Digging through them, here's the flag I want to use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-resize geometry     resize the image
</pre>
</p><p>
That sounds like what we need is to resize the images, though
&ldquo;geometry&rdquo; is
still a bit of an unknown. Now it's time to pop over to the ImageMagick Web
site,
where we find a ton of options for geometry, including:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
scale%: height and width both scaled by specified percentage.
</p></li><li><p>
scale-x%xscale-y%: height and width individually scaled by specified
percentages.
</p></li><li><p>
width: width given, height automatically selected to preserve
aspect ratio.
</p></li><li><p>
xheight: height given, width automatically selected to preserve
aspect ratio.
</p></li><li><p>
widthxheight: maximum values of height and width given, aspect ratio
preserved.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
To accomplish the conversion we want, we simply can specify the desired
width and let the utility do all the work:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ identify DSC_7466.JPG
DSC_7466.JPG JPEG 4288x2848 4288x2848+0+0 
 &#8618;8-bit DirectClass 8.148mb
$ convert -resize 1024 DSC_7466.JPG smaller-DSC_7466.JPG
$ identify smaller-DSC_7466.JPG
smaller-DSC_7466.JPG JPEG 1024x680 1024x680+0+0 8-bit 
 &#8618;DirectClass 776kb
</pre>
</p><p>
As hoped, the 4,288x2,848 image is shrunk down to 1,024x680, and the new,
smaller image is saved with the new filename.
</p><p>
Great! A quick <tt  >mkdir smaller</tt>, and we're in
business, so I utilize a shell for loop to iterate through the 500 images:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for filename in *.png
do
  convert -resize "50%" $filename smaller/$filename
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you've gone through the hassle of installing the ImageMagick
program, it's delightful to see how easily many different tasks can be
accomplished.
