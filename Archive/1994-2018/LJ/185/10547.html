Linux-MiniDisc&mdash;(Almost) Full MiniDisc Support for Linux
(<a href="https://wiki.physik.fu-berlin.de/linux-minidisc/doku.php" target="_self">https://wiki.physik.fu-berlin.de/linux-minidisc/doku.php</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
If you've got a stack of MiniDiscs lying around rotting, because you hate
rebooting into Windows just to have basic access to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> hardware,
others exist who share your pain. One of these people
is Adrian Glaubitz. Adrian sent me an e-mail, saying the following:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Almost all newer MiniDisc-Walkmans made by Sony and other manufacturers
have a USB-connector that allows download and upload of audio tracks
and data to the MD-Walkman from a PC. However, since Sony is also a major
record label, it has adopted a sophisticated system of DRM protection
that requires a proprietary software from Sony called SonicStage, which
runs on Windows only; even the latest Wine version is not able to run
it smoothly enough to allow transfer from/to an MD-Walkman. 
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Being a passionate Linux user since 1998, Adrian was annoyed by always
having to reboot into Windows to do anything with his player. There
were Linux projects around, but they never allowed him to do much more
than control his player&mdash;audio transfers were impossible. Adrian then
decided to start this project, together with a friend who'd been working
on parts of Wine for years (a great exercise in reverse engineering),
and now the project has almost 20 people (some from older/defunct MiniDisc
projects) contributing to the program in some form or another. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10547f1.large.jpg"><img src="10547f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The Linux MiniDisc Project now is at the point of basic GUI interaction and
functionality with your player&mdash;a major milestone for
previously neglected MiniDisc users.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10547f2.large.jpg"><img src="10547f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Tech heads should have a look at some of the
additional console tools available for further device wrangling.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
First, there are many strange library requirements
to take care of, so jump into your package manager to grab these elusive
creatures (they might have different names in your distro, but the
following at
least should give you a clue):

<pre     class="programlisting">
libqt4-dev build-essential libglib2.0-dev 
 &#8618;libmad0-dev libmcrypt-dev cmake libsox-dev 
 &#8618;libmcrypt4 libmcrypt-dev cmake
</pre>
</p><p>
To download the source, grab the repository using git. Open
a terminal, and enter a directory where you won't mind the source being
saved. Now, enter the following command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ git clone git://z6.physik.fu-berlin.de/linux-minidisc
</pre>
</p><p>
This project is broken down into two major parts: libhimd (the library)
and QHiMDTransfer (the GUI application). Let's compile both of
them at once. Change into the linux-minidisc directory, and compile the
program with the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd linux-minidisc
$ cmake .
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
Take note of the . character after cmake; it's not a misprint, and you'll
need it! Once compilation has finished, change into the QHiMDTransfer
directory and run the program, like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd QHiMDTransfer
$ ./QHiMDTransfer
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once you're inside the application, you need to mount your MiniDisc
device before you can browse it, upload to it or download from it. If you
don't have a MiniDisc device, but you're still interested in exploring
this program's features, there's an image you can use to simulate the
device available on the given wiki page, along with instructions. When
you have your device mounted, click File&rarr;Connect, and choose the
folder under which your MiniDisc player is mounted.
</p><p>
If all goes well, your player's contents will come up in the main
window. From here, you can choose to copy to or from the player with some
fairly obvious cues from the GUI (it's a pretty basic interface). For
those interested in doing more with their MiniDisc players, there are
also tools like himdtest in the libhimd directory for things
like track uploading, encryption info and so on.
</p><p>
For the moment, you can upload only MP3s and unencrypted PCM files as
WAVs, but the team is working on total functionality. As Adrian told
me:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We are now very confident that soon we will have finished
completely reverse-engineering the necessary protocols and file formats,
so that there will be complete support for MiniDisc on Linux without
any limitations by DRM, which are imposed by the original bloated
Windows software. Once we have a first stable version, a friend of mine
who is a Debian developer will help get the software into Debian
and make it available to all Debian/Ubuntu-users.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I hope they do. The more niche hardware that's supported by Linux, the
more our OS will be known for hardware-friendliness. Adrian tells me that
he's also chasing some Qt programmers who can spruce up the GUI a little,
so if you're a programmer on the lookout for a project to contribute to,
give him a shout.

SocNetV&mdash;Social Networks Visualizer 
(<a href="http://socnetv.sourceforge.net" target="_self">socnetv.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
According to SocNetV's Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Social Networks Visualizer (SocNetV) is a flexible and user-friendly
tool for the analysis and visualization of Social Networks. It lets you
construct networks (mathematical graphs) with a few clicks on a virtual
canvas or load networks of various formats (GraphViz, GraphML, Adjacency,
Pajek, UCINET, etc.) and modify them to suit your needs.
</p><p>
The application can compute basic network properties, such as density,
diameter and distances (shortest path lengths), as well as more
advanced structural statistics, such as node and network centralities
(i.e., closeness, betweenness, graph), clustering coefficient, etc.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
I tried reading that
a few times and my brain exploded, so I thought I'd give it a
look and find out just what it was all about and explain it in human
language. What I discovered was a deceptively simple yet sophisticated
program that organizes collected data in very cool ways. Now, I must
state from the outset that it has nothing to do with social networking in
the guise of MySpace, Facebook and so on (although you could use it for
plotting those things out if you really wanted to). SocNetV is a means of
plotting data in new and original ways.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10547f3.large.jpg"><img src="10547f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
SocNetV lets you plot data and shift it around, link sections and find
constellations in the sea of information.
</p></div></div><p>
When you make your first few clicks, it appears to be just another basic
plotting program, where you can make a flowchart or some other kind of
information &ldquo;tree&rdquo;. Not so. The advanced mathematical features
turn grid points into a fluid, almost organic organism that can
change and adapt in real time and reveal all sorts of patterns and flow
in what appears at first to be stagnant information.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
If you head to the Web site's download section, SocNetV is available in
packages for just about any distro you can shake a stick at, as well
as a Windows binary, the usual source and even a Klik package (I haven't
seen one of those for a while). I went with the Ubuntu package, but if
your distro isn't on the list, or if you would prefer the source for
whatever reason, you can do that too. If you are compiling from source,
you need to grab the Qt4 development files, along with the QtWebKit
development files. When you're ready, grab the source, extract it and
open a terminal in the folder. From here, it's a case of doing the usual:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure 
$ make 
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the installation has finished, you can run the program by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ socnetv
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're lucky, it'll also be in your system's menu; mine was under
Education&rarr;Mathematics&rarr;Social Networks Analysis and Visualisation.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once inside, the first thing you'll see is a large blank white space,
which is where your networks will be drawn. On the left are controls
to Add or Remove a Node and to Add or Remove a Link. These are the
most important controls, and you'll use them a lot. Now,
let's create our first node.
</p><p>
Click Add Node, and a small yellow circle appears in the blank space
on the right. This first node automatically becomes the first point of
reference for all the other nodes, so it's best to make
this node the most important&mdash;the nucleus, the genesis from which all
the other nodes spring. With the node made, it's best to give this
first node a label that sticks with the idea of it being a reference point.
</p><p>
Say you were mapping out your MySpace friends (goodness knows why, but
let's run with it). You might want to name the first node something like
&ldquo;My Home Page&rdquo;. Or, let's say you were a Dr Who fan mapping out the Dr
Who universe; you might want to call the first node &ldquo;The
Doctor&rdquo;, and so
on. You can do this by right-clicking on the node, and choosing
Options&rarr;Change Label.
</p><p>
Now, to add your surrounding nodes, click Add Node again, and a new node
with the number 2 appears on the screen. To link this to node number 1,
click Add Link. A series of prompts now appears in regard to the
rest of the field of nodes, which is just the two for now. First up
is the target node&mdash;1, by default. Next is the strength of the
link, which, by default, will be 1.0. This value is very important,
as it defines how valuable/important/relevant the link is to another
node. You can use any number between &ndash;20 to 20, with positive numbers
drawing a solid line between nodes and negative numbers drawing dotted
lines. The higher the number, the thicker the line.
</p><p>
You've now connected your first two nodes, and from here I suggest
adding some more to get the idea. If you right-click on a node,
you'll notice the Options menu has a number of things to play with
in terms of customizing each node, such as turning it into a square,
changing the color and so on. Doing so helps differentiate one kind
of node from another, helping to define what information it
is representing visually. For instance, in my diagram of Metallica's history and
affiliations (a band with a loaded history and a great deal of
influence&mdash;a perfect testing ground for this kind of thing), band members are
represented by a green circle, and bands/collaborators are represented
by yellow circles.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10547f4.large.jpg"><img src="10547f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
My Metallica chart in all its glory! Well, there's a
few mistakes, but I'm sure 
you won't mind.
</p></div></div><p>
You also can change the color of each line linking a node, adding more
differentiation to a sea of probably messy information. For actual band
members, I've gone with a strong gray line, with a dotted line for
ex-members, and red line for the late Cliff Burton (RIP). Actual
bands and important projects are signified by blue lines, and casual
projects and one-offs are represented by pink lines. Don't forget that
you also can move around nodes by left-clicking and dragging if things
get messy and you need to do some rearranging.
</p><p>
Once you've made yourself a full grid of information, you can apply a
bunch of crazy mathematics that can morph your information in real time,
showing you new patterns in the information that you probably
never thought of before. Check out the Layout menu and
experiment with all the options for a real demo, which showcases what
this program is really all about.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10547f5.large.jpg"><img src="10547f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Advanced mathematics can morph your networks around in real time (as
this screenshot is in the middle of doing), as your structure begins to
resemble a moving, almost breathing organism.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10547f6.large.jpg"><img src="10547f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Certain preset formulas can constellate your information,
showing you new information in otherwise banal data.
</p></div></div><p>
Although this project still has a few kinks and interface problems, anyone
interested in the flow of information and discovering patterns in any area
of life definitely should check out this project. In terms of industry,
social analysts looking for new patterns in society, wealth and so on
would find this of particular use. I'd also like to try using it in
Analytical Psychology, mapping out various constellations of ideas in
someone's psyche. There are endless uses for a tool like this that are
limited only by your imagination&mdash;fascinating stuff.
