A Funny
</h4><p>
I just found this so funny I had to share. MSN decided to
call its search engine Bing. I don't know who the idiot was who thought
of this one. I know in Chinese <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bing</em></span> means
&ldquo;disease&rdquo;, so Windows is
admitting what it is? LOL&mdash;I just thought this should be shared with
the Linux world.

Linux on the Desktop, Part II
</h4><p>
I am sitting here reading the new <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> that
came today (July 2009), and I come across this letter to the editor from Kulmacet titled
&ldquo;Linux on the Desktop?&rdquo; where he mentions that Linux as a desktop OS has the
apps, but lacks the stability. I, like Shawn in the response, am scratching
my head. Typically, users feel the opposite. We have the stability, but lack
some of the mainstream apps. He goes on basically to mention how Windoze is
quirky but at least it works.
</p><p>
Yes, when you buy a fresh new Dell or HP, it just works. Those companies
have taken the time in their shops to make sure it does before shipping.
But,
how many of us out there have built a fresh new rig with Windows? Does it
&ldquo;just work&rdquo; then? No. You still have to find/install the newest drivers and
hope they have them for your version (Vista, XP, 32-/64-bit). Linux is the same
way. Sure, you may have to do a little configuring, but you do that in
Windows as well. I am currently using a Qosmio X305-Q705 running Fedora 10
64-bit. And when I did a fresh install of Fedora, guess what? Everything
worked! Sound, wireless, video&mdash;everything. So &ldquo;Windows just
works&rdquo; is not
a great argument. Most computers running Linux have decent support for most
devices out of the box. The most I really have to do is occasionally get
some wireless drivers or the NVIDIA drivers (which have a Linux version) if
I intend to do any heavy gaming. For business, you probably wouldn't
need this. 
</p><p>
And, regarding those forums mentioned in the letter, in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>most</em></span> cases, those unanswered
problems probably were answered in many other places in those same forums.
It just takes a little looking. For &ldquo;typical&rdquo; users, how many
Blue Screens of Death do
you see in Windows compared to kernel panics with Linux? Linux surpasses
Windows in stability by far, no matter your experience level&mdash;just my
two cents though.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Cary   <br><br>
</p><p>
My experience has been similar to yours. In fact, at first I thought
the letter was tongue in cheek, but it looks like the reader had some
serious bad luck with Linux. Hopefully, our responses will encourage
folks having difficulties with stability to take another look at their
hardware, because as you mention, stability is generally one thing
Linux gets very right.&mdash;Ed.

Unsung Hero
</h4><p>
Has anyone thought to check out the World Digital Library? Per the
publication <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Library of Congress Gazette</em></span> article
published today (May 29, 2009) titled &ldquo;WDL 1.0 Technical
Info&rdquo;, the following might be of interest to
the Linux community:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Development time: ~13 months
</p></li><li><p>
Lines of code: ~50,000
</p></li><li><p>
Test cases written: ~600
</p></li><li><p>
Development platform: Linux
</p></li><li><p>
Deployment platform: Solaris
</p></li><li><p>
Key technologies: Django, Python, MySQL, Solr/Lucene, Squid Nginx,
Seadragon
</p></li></ul></div><p>
It also provided the following launch-day statistics:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Page views: 7.1 million
</p></li><li><p>
Visitors: 600,000
</p></li><li><p>
Peak hits/hour: 32 million
</p></li></ul></div><p>
When there is a major application being contemplated and the IT folks all say
Windows, maybe this will give them pause. The article did not give a byline
or mention which distribution of Linux, unfortunately.

Sadly, this is one more example of the unsung heroics Linux is responsible
for accomplishing. I wish &ldquo;open-source infrastructure&rdquo; was a required
course for anyone going into the IT field. Unfortunately, the implementation
of open source generally is driven by (lack of) finances. Thanks for
the information.&mdash;Ed.

Disappointed with KDE 4
</h4><p>
I recently upgraded from Kubuntu 7.10 to Kubuntu 8.10, and
I was amazed to find that KDE had jumped from version 3.5 to version 4.2!
I am a really KDE-ish guy, as the first Linux desktop I ever saw
was KDE 3.x on Knoppix.
As a result, I learned to love KDE. KDE feels like home.
I don't hate GNOME. GNOME is a great desktop, and it even starts
and runs faster than KDE. But, it is less configurable than KDE,
and even though the difference is minor, it's enough for me to use
KDE&mdash;at least, until KDE 4.x came along.
</p><p>
KDE 4.x is a major recode from the 3 series. For instance, the desktop now
has a widget-based setup&mdash;widgets go on the desktop,
not files. You want a comic strip on the desktop? Sure, it has a widget
for that. You want a battery monitor? A dictionary? A clock? A calculator?
A 15-piece puzzle? It's got widgets for those too. How exciting&mdash;until
you remember that &ldquo;widgets, not files&rdquo; has &ldquo;NOT
FILES&rdquo; in it. No more putting icons directly on the desktop,
which is great, if you always have wanted a comic strip on the desktop.
But, no files directly on the desktop isn't
the only bad surprise that comes packed with KDE 4. It also is much less
configurable, because <span   class="emphasis"><em>so</em></span> much was recoded, the KDE coders have
not had time to re-add all the functions of good-old KDE 3, and the
configuration options that go with them are all missing&mdash;for example,
auto-hiding the Kicker. You can't auto-hide the Kicker in KDE 4 at all,
whereas KDE 3 could be set up to hide the Kicker as soon as the mouse
left the Kicker and show it again as soon as the mouse hit the bottom of the
screen.
</p><p>
Of course, there is a reason for all this. Apparently, the KDE coders
felt KDE was getting behind the times, and it was time to upgrade the
interface.
KDE 4 has good desktop effects, and although I love the effects and
interface, for now, KDE does it at the expense of everything else.
</p><p>
Are you ready to give up your favorite file manager, Konqueror, for a new file
manager that is missing some of Konqueror's best features? Then, upgrade to
KDE 4.
</p><p>
Hopefully, the KDE guys didn't give up good features for good. I'm
waiting
on edge for KDE 5, in which, hopefully, all of KDE 3's good features will
have returned. But for now, I am using GNOME, which still has much more
reasonable
features.

From Afghanistan with Love
</h4><p>
I'm currently in the hills of Afghanistan and found that receiving snail
mail is very unpredictable/unreliable. Therefore, being new to the Linux
world, I was looking for quality reading that I could download onto my
laptop. After searching all the Web, I came to the conclusion that your
subscription helped me with the understanding of how Linux operates
compared to the dreaded Windows and Mac environments. I've completely
removed all Windows from my system now. 
Special thanks go out to the support in your subscription department as
well! I accidentally subscribed to the print edition, and within minutes
called and received a subscription change. This allowed me to download the
latest digital edition of your magazine. Additionally, I was able to go
to the back editions of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> and grab all the ones that interested
me. 
Again, you guys ROCK! 
Thanks for the great service and product!

Ever Mangle a Configuration File?
</h4><p>
Reading the December 2008 issue (five months late!), I was somewhat
amused by the box on page 37 &ldquo;Regenerating smb.conf in
Debian/Ubuntu&rdquo;. Re-installing a package merely because a
configuration file got mangled seemed rather unnecessary. If I
am experimenting with something new, I will keep a copy
(such as smb.conf-orig). Beyond that, I keep configuration files
under RCS control, so I can turn back the clock to any version I
want.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
David Penman  <br><br>
</p><p>
You certainly have best practice in mind when you tweak your config
files, but unfortunately many users do not. Sadly, I often fall into
that category myself! And don't get me started on how many times I have
to ask users, &ldquo;Do you have a backup?&rdquo; Thankfully, Linux distributions
generally have a way to get back to the defaults when we do silly
things.&mdash;Ed.

Linux on the Desktop, Part III</h4><p>
In the July 2009 issue's Letters section, Kulmacet commented that Linux was still not a good
desktop OS and did not &ldquo;work&rdquo; out of the box. When I hear this, I just
scratch my head. Maybe the reader was installing an older Gentoo? Ubuntu,
OpenSUSE and Fedora are all mainstream distros and install very easily.
Recently, a family member asked me to take a look at her computer
that took ages to boot up, and then was so slow it was pretty much unusable. I
don't have to go into the sordid details of all the viruses, spyware and
other junk the scanner turned up. &ldquo;Can someone just make a system that
works and doesn't get all these viruses?&rdquo;, she asked. I backed up the data,
wiped the drive and installed OpenSUSE 11.1 with GNOME. After a brief
tutorial, off she went. A few months later, I hadn't heard anything and
had assumed Windows was re-installed. No, she was very happy, and the
system was fast with no viruses. She even installed a new printer, scanner and
camera.
</p><p>
Not every user will have this experience, but I have converted quite a
few friends and coworkers to Linux during the past few years. Of course, I use
my knowledge and experience to get them over that fear of the unknown. I am
sure that your readers could share similar experiences.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
George   <br><br>
</p><p>
Like my previous comment, I fully agree with you. The reader last month
obviously had an uncommon, and unfortunate Linux experience. Hopefully,
we'll all be the encouragement needed to try again!&mdash;Ed.

No More Break-Ins
</h4><p>
Nice article on the WD MyBook World Edition [see Federico Lucifredi's
&ldquo;Hacking Your Portable Linux Server&rdquo; in the July 2009 issue]. I just picked up a copy from the
local computer store and was happy to discover that one doesn't have to
break in anymore. The WD software allows you to open up the system 
nowadays. I don't know if that works for all World Editions&mdash;in
particular,
the MyBook II in the article&mdash;however, my guess would be it
works there too.

Re: Bad Guys
</h4><p>
I let the first letter to the magazine that disturbed me go, but after
reading this most recent complaint, I had to write in. However, I in no way
am attacking <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
As a communist and member of the International Socialist Organization, I
always find it saddening to read or hear people's distorted understanding
of communism. Francis Kohl wrote in to claim Marx is responsible for the
&ldquo;most horrible dictatorships in history&rdquo; [see the July 2009
issue's Letters]. There are two reasons this is
usually a view pushed by people. First, because Marx called for the
&ldquo;dictatorship of the proletariat&rdquo;; however, this in no way refers to an
individual dictator. It is the ruling of the entire proletariat over the
bourgeoisie. Second, because many individual dictators have proclaimed
themselves Marxists and even have socialist states. But, someone saying
something does not make it true, as we see with Kohl's comments.
</p><p>
If you care to blame someone for Pol Pot's abuses, why not blame someone
who <span   class="emphasis"><em>did</em></span> influence him? Like Buddha? Pol Pot's Theravada Buddhism is what
created his idea of &ldquo;communism&rdquo;. This Buddhism is why he saw the rural
peasants as the revolutionary class and the need to push everyone out of
the cities and massacre the &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; part of the population. This is
directly opposed to Marxism!
</p><p>
Stalin was a horrible dictator, and Lenin saw this potential and while sick
and dying, called for his removal from power. Stalin already had gained much
support in the military by this time, and years later began the terror against
those in the party opposing his disgusting regime. Thus, he executed and
exiled the few remaining communists, like Leon Trotsky, who escaped to
Mexico before being assassinated by a Stalin hit man.
</p><p>
I'm also confused at the fact that no one on the left or right who
condemns Marx for these atrocities ever blames capitalist thinkers for the
dictators who had &ldquo;free markets&rdquo; (like ours), mass privatization and cuts
on welfare programs&mdash;Augusto Pinochet of Chile, for example. They also don't
attack capitalist thinkers for the deaths of millions due to the quest for
profit followed by the corporations around the world. 
This is not to say Marx and Lenin were pacifists or perfect. Both were
human and made mistakes in their ideas and actions, and both understood the
ruling class would not go away without a fight. If Kohl opposes this, I
assume he does not dare to stand to the United States' National
Anthem&mdash;you
know, that song about a bloody revolutionary to overthrow the ruling class
and enact progressive measures?
</p><p>
Lastly, there was a letter many months ago [January 2009], in which Gene said he wanted
students to learn more Adam Smith and less Karl Marx. I think Gene may want
to study some Adam Smith first. Adam Smith was a supporter of a progressive
income and estate tax on the rich to &ldquo;contribute to the public
expense&rdquo;!
Read <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Wealth of Nations</em></span>, and you'll see it's clear Smith would be
condemned as a socialist if he were a politician in the United States
today.
</p><p>
I am always shocked at the large anti-socialist crowd in the Free
Software community, when I see the Internet age and Free Software as great
examples of the potential for communism. Communism is not a bullet in the
back of your head for not sharing, as Eric S. Raymond said in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Revolution
OS</em></span>. I'd be more worried about him and his collection of guns shooting
someone for being on his private property.
