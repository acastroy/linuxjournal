Qt always has been about cross-platform. By providing a
rich API that isn't tied to a specific platform, Qt can
be both intuitive to use and innovative.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1d2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Qt toolkit originally was designed not only to be nice to work
with, but also to allow for moving application source code between
platforms. Today, the three major desktop environments are supported: X11,
OS X and Windows. As portability is one of the key goals of the toolkit,
it rarely runs into common issues, such as features missing
on a specific platform or applications not integrating well in certain
environments.
</p><p>
Qt's journey to fame really began more than ten years ago with the KDE
Project. As one of KDE's cornerstones, it might come
as a surprise to you that later incarnations of Qt try to integrate
with GTK+ and GNOME. It even allows the incorporation of the glib event
loop, all to fulfill the mission of providing portable code that looks and
feels right on all platforms.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1d4b8"></a>
Looking Right</h2></div></div><p>
When discussing portable GUI source code, the graphical user interface
is probably what comes to mind first.
Providing widgets that look right on all platforms
is an engineering feat. It takes many tricks to be able to use native
painting methods, adapt to styling and just generally to fit in. Add to
that the
ability to subclass and customize widgets, and you have quite a handful of
things that have to be incorporated.
</p><p>
And, making an application feel visually right on all platforms takes
even more work. Margins, spacing, alignment&mdash;even the ordering of certain
widgets&mdash;all need to be taken into account. Qt addresses all of these issues.
A basic dialog window can be used to demonstrate how.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows a property dialog with a set of labels to
the left and fields for editing to the right. At the bottom are
the standard Help, Apply, Ok and Cancel buttons. This might look like
a simple dialog, but compare it to Figures 2 and 3. It's the
same dialog, but on different platforms.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10519f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Dialog in a KDE Environment
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10519f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Dialog in a Windows Environment
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10519f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A Dialog in an OS X Environment
</p></div></div><p>
The platform imposes the order of the buttons at the bottom of the
dialog, the alignment of the properties' labels, as well
as the expansion policy of the fields representing the property values.
All of these need to be handled according to the current platform's rules.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1dc48"></a>
Customizing the Look</h2></div></div><p>
In some situations, blindly following the current platform's look and
feel isn't what you are after. Sometimes you may want to
subtly give hints to the user. For instance, you may want to highlight all
required fields or change the color of a progress bar. Usually, this
means subclassing the source widget to specialize it. Then, you will
use your special widget for all the required fields. Now, imagine
having not only text fields, but also check boxes, drop-down lists and more.
</p><p>
In Qt, you can address this problem in two ways. Either you can create
a custom palette object that you apply to all fields you want to
highlight or change color. Or, you can use a stylesheet.
</p><p>
The advantage of using stylesheets is that they allow more advanced
operations. Figure 4 shows this in three steps. The top row of widgets
uses the standard style, and the second row uses the following
stylesheet:

<pre     class="programlisting">
QLineEdit {
  background-color: rgb(255, 255, 185);
}

QCheckBox::indicator:unchecked {
  image: url(:/images/cb-unchecked.png);
}

QRadioButton::indicator:unchecked {
  image: url(:/images/rb-unchecked.png);
}
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10519f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. From Standard Style to the Extreme
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, the syntax was heavily inspired by the cascading
stylesheets (CSS) used in Web design. The text field is an instance of the
QLineEdit class. For it, it is enough to specify a background color. For
the radio button and check box, you need to provide images that represent
the indicator. More states than unchecked need to be
included here, but to simplify for this example, they have been left out.
</p><p>
Merely changing the background color could have been achieved as
easily by altering the specific widgets' palette. However, the
last row in Figure 4 shows that you can go further. The stylesheet used
here
changes the font, text color, border and background. For the QLineEdit
class, the stylesheet looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
QLineEdit {
  color: red;
  font: 75 14pt "DejaVu Sans";

  border: 2px solid rgb(0, 112, 157);
  border-radius: 3px;

  background: qlineargradient(spread:pad, 
              &#8618;x1:0, y1:0, x2:0, y2:1, 
              &#8618;stop:0 black, stop:1 rgb(0, 112, 157));
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the color changes are not limited to only solid colors. The
background is a gradient, and the whole shape of the border has been
altered&mdash;all this, while still maintaining the source code's
cross-platform portability.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1e170"></a>
Accessing Drives</h2></div></div><p>
What we've discussed so far affects only the visuals. You can
try all of this from within Qt Designer or QtCreator
without writing a single line of source code (not counting the
stylesheets). But, cross-platform programming is more than just look and feel.
For instance,
how do you traverse a filesystem on multiple platforms without providing
unique source code for each platform?
</p><p>
Qt provides classes for this. For example, the following short snippet
shows the directories contained in the root directory of each drive
of a given computer. On a Windows machine, it lists the drives one
by one, while on UNIX machines, it lists only the root drive /
(note that foreach is a Qt-supplied C++ macro):

<pre     class="programlisting">
foreach( QFileInfo drv, QDir::drives() ) {
  qDebug( "%s contains", qPrintable(drv.absolutePath()) );
  foreach( QString name,
           drv.absoluteDir().entryList( QDir::Dirs ) ) {
    qDebug( " %s", qPrintable(name) );
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
By using the QDir class to access the filesystem, you can do so in a
platform-independent manner. The class contains static functions for
common entry points, such as drives, the user's home directory, the
current directory, as well as the system's directory for temporary files.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1e380"></a>
Handling Text</h2></div></div><p>
Another common source of cross-platform problems occurs at a much more
basic level&mdash;the encoding of text and data. Qt provides a custom
class for handling text strings called QString. It provides Unicode
representation across all platforms. The string class itself can convert
to and from UTF-8, ASCII and Latin1. It also can convert to and from most
other string representations using text codecs. Qt comes with a variety
of codecs, but it also is possible to create custom codecs to handle
special cases.
</p><p>
When reading and writing text to and from files, the encoding is
respected by using the QTextStream class. This class provides a stream
interface based on the &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; operators. It usually autodetects the
encoding, but you can use the setCodec function to force it to a specific
setting. To illustrate, the following short snippet of code reads a
line from a text file encoded as UTF-32 on a big-endian system:


<pre     class="programlisting">

QTextStream stream( &amp;file );
stream.setCodec( QTextCodec::codecForName("UTF-32BE") );
QString myString = stream.readLine();

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1e5e8"></a>
Which End Is First?</h2></div></div><p>
Speaking of endianness, this is often an issue that occurs when dealing
with cross-platform code. The issue with endianness is that when you
write binary data, such as a 32-bit value (four bytes), you can
choose to write the bytes in two different directions: left to right
or right to left, aka big endian and little endian.
</p><p>
The default order for writing bytes depends on the endianness
of the system on which the program is running. Some architectures,
such as IA32 and the VAX, use little endian. Others, such as PowerPC,
ColdFire and SPARC, use big endian. Others still, such as ARM, MIPS,
IA64 and Sparc V9, are able to do either (although which one is used
often has to be hard-wired into the system when the hardware is built).
Systems based on most of these architectures are commonly targeted by Qt.
</p><p>
To ensure cross-platform compatibility for binary data,
you need to specify the order explicitly when writing
and again when reading.
By using a QDataStream to handle binary file formats, endianness no longer
is an issue. You simply specify the byte order to use and then use the
stream operators, and it just works.
</p><p>
The snippet of code below shows this. It also contains the setVersion
function, letting you specify which version of Qt's encoding of complex
data types you want to use. For instance, if the internal representation
of colors changed between version 2 and 4 of Qt,
by specifying an older version, you still can read and write data in
the old format using the same stream class.
This is something that comes in
handy when having to handle old legacy file formats from modern code:

<pre     class="programlisting">

QDataStream stream( &amp;file );
stream.setByteOrder( QDataStream::BigEndian );
stream.setVersion( QDataStream::Qt_4_0 );
int value;
stream &gt;&gt; value;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1e8a8"></a>
Storing Preferences</h2></div></div><p>
When handing user preferences, Windows has the registry. UNIX systems
usually rely on hidden directories, one for each application. OS X has an XML
format for preferences. This works fine for users. They usually do not
rely on being able to move their preferences between their computers,
especially if they do not use the same operating system. From a software
developer's perspective, the situation is different.
</p><p>
To resolve this, Qt provides the QSettings class. It provides access
to each platform's preferred method. It also can be used to create and
read INI files outside the platform's system that can be moved between
platforms by the users.
</p><p>
The QSettings class relies on the name of the application and
the application provider. Then, you simply use the setValue and value functions to
write and read. The returned value is of the type QVariant. This type
can be used to hold any type of data. The basic types, such as integers,
are handled directly. More complex types, such as QColor, rely on the
data stream operators:


<pre     class="programlisting">

QSettings settings( "The App Company", "The App" );
int v = settings.value("myInt").toInt();
QColor c = settings.value("myColour").value&lt;QColor&gt;();

</pre>
</p><p>
Many more issues arise when moving code between
platforms. Qt's solution is to provide 
a Qt API. This API removes almost all traces of specific platforms,
while trying to support all functionality on each of the platforms
involved. More complex cases than the ones shown here involve
multithreading, database access, networking and so on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f1eb68"></a>
Embedded</h2></div></div><p>
So far, this discussion has focused only on moving code between
different desktops, which is just half of Qt's ambition. Qt comes in
three embedded flavors: embedded Linux, Windows CE and Symbian S60.
</p><p>
The Windows CE and S60 ports make it possible to run Qt applications on
phones and palmtops. Each of the ports takes the target device's styling
into account and integrates the application in a seamless manner. At the
time of this writing, the S60 port is available only as a technical
preview;
a full release is planned later in 2009.
</p><p>
The embedded Linux version makes it possible to run Qt directly on the
framebuffer. This greatly reduces the footprint of the system, making
it embeddable. The windowing needs are covered by an integrated window
manager QWS (Qt Windowing System), but generally, these systems run
their applications in full-screen mode.
</p><p>
One interesting feature is the ability to run applications in a virtual
framebuffer, making it possible to emulate the correct resolution,
bit depth and input behavior on a development machine. This allows
you to start developing the software earlier in the project
cycle. It also can simplify debugging, as you can avoid remote debugging.
</p><p>
The step when moving from desktop to embedded is generally larger than
when moving between desktops or embedded systems. There are a number
of issues that a framework cannot solve. The most common issues
are available screen space, lack of computing power and
lack of memory. All these areas are becoming less of a concern as
the power, memory and screen resolution of embedded systems increase.
</p><p>
Qt provides the ability to style and stretch interfaces
to fit the screen. You also can set the global strut. This is the minimum
size that any user interface element can have. By adjusting this factor,
you can tune widgets to make them usable using a finger, stylus
or mouse.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f15710"></a>
Embracing Qt</h2></div></div><p>
Qt provides an API that can be used across a variety of platforms. All
major desktops are supported, but also the major embeddable platforms. The
strength of Qt is that all these platforms can be reached through one
API. The API is provided by one library, one set of goals and one approach
to constructing APIs. To take full advantage of Qt's cross-platform
ability, you should embrace the use of Qt in all fields.
If you do, you can move your code as easy as you can compile it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f15818"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Using Platform-Specifics through a Movable API</b></p><p>
Qt might provide a cross-platform API that can cover almost all cases,
but you still might want to use platform-specific features. For instance,
opening the window as maximized in Windows and normal on OS X and X11. To
handle these situations, Qt provides preprocessor defines describing on which
OS you are running and which windowing system you are using. For
example, on Linux, you'll find Q_OS_LINUX and probably Q_WS_X11.
</p><p>
When you know on which system you are running, you can access all X11
events by re-implementing the x11EventFilter function of the QApplication
class. On OS X, you can get hold of the CoreGraphics handle from the
macCGHandle function of each QWidget.
</p><p>
If you want to avoid writing platform-specific code, you still can give
platform-specific hints. For instance, you can give a hint to a QDialog that it
is a sheet.
This is a dialog that appears inside another window or dialog that provides
part of the larger window's features.
You do this by setting the window flags of your dialog
to Qt::Sheet.
</p><p>
On X11, this type of hint relies on the window manager's ability
to understand it. This means the hint must be used as
a hint, not a setting. If you want complete control, pass
Qt::X11BypassWindowManagerHint. This tries to avoid the window manager
completely, which is not a nice thing to do, but might be necessary.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e25580.0x1f15b30"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Cross-Platform Development Using a Cross-Platform
Environment</b></p><p>
Qt comes with a set of tools that can be used separately or from within
the fairly new QtCreator application. QtCreator was created using
Qt and provides an advanced code editor, documentation, an integrated
version of Qt Designer and editors for Qt-specific files, such as project
files and resource files.
</p><p>
Because all the Qt tools also are available separately, it is common to
use another IDE or just a text editor and command line. Qt Software
provides integrations for Microsoft Visual Studio, Xcode and Eclipse.
There also are a range of free IDE projects out there, such as Edyuk,
QDevelop and KDevelop.
</p><p>
So, what does QtCreator provide that the others don't? First, it
comes as a part of the Qt SDK. The SDK version of Qt comes as a single
download with a prebuilt version of Qt and QtCreator set up and ready
to go. Second, it provides a graphical debugger interface, letting
you use gdb in the easiest possible manner across all desktop platforms
supported by Qt. The debugger knows of Qt and provides macros for easy
viewing of QString objects as well as for looking inside Qt's list classes.
