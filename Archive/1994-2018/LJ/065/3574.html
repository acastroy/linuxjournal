    A look at Applix's open-source initiative&mdash;what they
    are doing and why.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1593580.0x168b3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Applix, Inc. is best known for Applixware
Office, a cross-platform suite of desktop productivity tools. (See
review by Dean Staff in this issue.) Founded in 1983, Applix's
original goal was to develop and market multi-user graphical
UNIX-based integrated office applications. Since then, Applix has
become very popular among those in the engineering, government and
financial sectors. Applixware became available for Linux in
September of 1998. In March 1999, Applix announced its first Open
Source initiative with SHELF.
</p><p>The Extension Language Facility (ELF) enables developers to
integrate applications and corporate data with Applixware Office.
For example, all user interfaces for the Applixware applications
(Words, Graphics, Spreadsheets, Presents, Mail and Data) are all
built with ELF. SHELF (SHared ELF) is the open-source release of
the ELF developer tools including Applix Builder, an
object-oriented, graphical IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
released under the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL). (See
Figures 1 and 2.)</p><p><a href="3574f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Applix Builder Screen</b></span></a></p><p>SHELF can be used to rebuild the ELF shared library which is
used by newer versions of Applixware. This allows you to extend
ELF's capabilities and take advantage of those changes from within
Applixware.</p><p>Like Java, ELF is a platform-independent language that does
not need to be recompiled on each platform. In general, ELF
applications execute slower than C or Java. Computation-intensive
functions are best implemented as C add-ins to ELF. ELF's loose
type checking is an advantage in smaller applications, but can
become a disadvantage for large-scale applications. Unlike C, ELF
is fully memory-safe and includes error signalling. Developers are
free to focus on algorithms and the user interface rather than
memory management. ELF also provides simple and robust interfaces
to relational databases.</p><p>Applix is hoping ELF will become a popular language for
layered applications and lightweight application-building where
development cycles are measured in person-days to person-months.
They do not anticipate ELF displacing C++ or Java. However, ELF's
strengths could help find it a strong developer community.</p><p><a href="3574f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Application Class Screen</b></span></a></p><p>Asked how Applix intends to generate developer interest in
ELF, Richard Manly, Director of Product Management and Marketing
for Applix, said customers will be doing this in two ways:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The first is to create a series of SHELF
applications which will be offered in Open Source that will show
developers what can be achieved by using the SHELF development
tools. The first of these applications will be the Linux Palm
Desktop (LPD), a graphical desktop application which will enable
Palm or Palm Pilot users to download, view and search their PDA
data in a familiar user interface. By offering the LPD application
in Open Source, developers will be able to use the interface to
extend the use of their data into either their own programs or into
other applications which run on Linux machines. We'll also offer a
link to Applixware for automatic generation of word-processing
documents, e-mail and spreadsheets.</p></blockquote></div><p>Thousands of developers have already used ELF as part of
Applixware to build a wide variety of applications. According to
Manly, these range from</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>using ELF to record and play back keystrokes and
mouse clicks to automate often-repeated activities within
Applixware to extending the functionality of the spreadsheet to
additional analytics to full-scale applications which utilize ELF's
ability to integrate with third-party applications using databases
(via ODBC), sockets, shared libraries and RPC calls and CORBA via
IIOP.</p></blockquote></div><p>The &ldquo;Free Stuff!&rdquo; section of the Applixware for Linux site
(see Resources) contains sample ELF applications such as Solitaire,
which can be freely downloaded. The Linux Palm Desktop application
will be posted at the Applix Open Source Central site. This site
will be the focal point for SHELF development including downloading
the SHELF distribution and contributed extensions.
</p><p>A variety of books about using ELF are available from
Applix's web site. Both Applixware and SHELF are available for all
major Linux distributions as well as Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, Digital
UNIX, Irix, Windows 95/98 and NT.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1593580.0x168bad8"></a>Applix Linux Division</h2></div></div><p>In June, Applix announced a new division that will work with
the Linux and Open Source software community to source and brand
applications. The Applix Linux Division will also continue to
aggressively market, sell and support the company's Applixware
product suite for the UNIX and Linux markets.</p><p>Applix is currently growing and recruiting additional
developers and marketing staff for the new division. Asked how the
new division will change Applix, Manly replied,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>By being focused on the Linux market, we'll be
more able to respond quickly to the demands and direction of the
Linux user base.</p></blockquote></div><p><a href="3574s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a>
