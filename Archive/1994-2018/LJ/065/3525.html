administrator or a programmer. I was looking for a more stable
alternative to Microsoft Windows. Once I found Linux, the search
for productivity software soon began. I still needed to interact
with others using the typical MS Windows applications, so importing
and exporting to these formats was a priority. I took a serious
look at Applixware and present here the results of my
investigation.
</p><p>Right out of the box, some changes from version 4.3 are
apparent. The package has been redesigned, and a WordPerfect-style
template for the keyboard provides all the function and
&ldquo;accelerator&rdquo; keys for quick reference. Someone definitely put
some thought into the preparation of the user's manual. The usual
glued spine binding has been replaced with a large spiral binding,
allowing the user to either fold the cover over, leaving only the
desired page face up, or lay it flat without the pages flipping
over while attempting to use the computer. The biggest improvement
is a single consolidated table of contents and index for the
complete manual. (Version 4.3 had three distinct sections, each
with its own table of contents and index, making it quite difficult
to use.) While many positive improvements have been made, the
manual is still lacking sections referring to Applix Data (the
database module), Applix Mail (the built-in e-mail module) and
Applix Builder (the graphical programming module).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb9580.0x1cb1a80"></a>Rating</h2></div></div><p>I used the following rating system in regard to importing
files to the different Applixware applications:</p><p>***** (Excellent): File was seamlessly imported, with no
errors or anomalies encountered.**** (Good): File was imported, but
some formatting was lost.*** (Fair): Import was successful, but all
formatting was lost.** (Poor): Import completed with corrupted data
that could be repaired.* (Fail): Import failed or data was
corrupted beyond repair.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb9580.0x1cb1be0"></a>Importing to Applix Words ****</h2></div></div><p>I was unable to import a Framemaker 5 file, but this may have
to do with the fact that I used an application other than
Framemaker 5 to create the source file. Importing an RTF file was
flawless, and importing Microsoft Word 95 and Corel WordPerfect
6/7/8 files was nearly flawless, with only one glitch&mdash;it added a
couple of tabs after the text on a right-justified
paragraph.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb9580.0x1cb1ce8"></a>Importing to Applix Spreadsheets ***</h2></div></div><p>Importing spreadsheets from other applications was not as
clean as in Applix Words. Microsoft Excel 4 and 95 files were
imported with the loss of only an embedded image, while all cell
and data formatting were preserved. Importing a Lotus 1-2-3 file
was not as successful. On a 123-97 file, all data was imported
intact, but some formatting was lost&mdash;most notably the borders. On
Lotus wk1, wk3 and Microsoft Excel 3 files, all formatting was
lost, but the data was imported intact. All file formats preserved
formulas in the source files, but all embedded images were
lost.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb9580.0x1cb1df0"></a>Importing to Applix Presents *</h2></div></div><p>All attempts to import graphics files failed. PowerPoint 4
files were a complete failure. The procedure actually started for
PowerPoint 95, but failed. And the biggest failure of all&mdash;Applix
Presents does not even support the import of Freelance Graphics
files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb9580.0x1cb1ef8"></a>Importing to Applix Data *</h2></div></div><p>If you want to query an SQL database created with Oracle or
Informix, or you plan to create a database from scratch, you might
be able to use Applix Data. If you are thinking of importing an
existing database, forget it because Applix Data will not even open
an industry-standard Dbase III or IV file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bb9580.0x1cb2000"></a>Exporting from Applixware ***</h2></div></div><p>Applixware seems to export better than it imports. Using a
text document with various paragraph and font formats, I was able
to export an Applix Words document to HTML without any errors. It
picked up underlining, bold and italics without a hitch and had no
problem with justification.</p><p>I exported the same document to Microsoft Word 95/97 format
(using RTF), again without a loss in formatting&mdash;even successfully
exporting a forced page break. When exporting to Corel WordPerfect,
the only error occurred on full justification, as it replaced
<span   class="emphasis"><em>full</em></span> justification with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>left</em></span> justification.</p><p>As for Applix Spreadsheets files, it exports basic font
formats, data and simple formulas, but it drops embedded objects
such as graphs when exporting to both Lotus 1-2-3 or Microsoft
Excel formats.</p><p>Applix Presents files can be exported to Microsoft PowerPoint
97 format, but it seems to do only simple slide presentations
well.</p><p>As a standalone productivity suite, the Applixware package is
more than sufficient. It is inexpensive (I've seen it for as little
as $159.00 Canadian), powerful, and in most cases, easy to learn.
The major pitfall is the import issue in which it cannot properly
import some of the more popular file formats, most notably dBase
and presentation files. If you plan to use it to create files for
the rest of the world, stick to the word processor and spreadsheet
modules. You will be able to import and export to the most popular
formats, if not in native format, then through RTF.</p><p>I deliberately did not review the Applix Mail module, because
e-mail clients are a dime a dozen, and while it is a nice bonus, I
would not purchase a productivity suite for it. I also skipped
Applix Builder, since I am not a programmer and could not provide
an informed opinion.</p><p>Personally, I feel some major improvements still remain to be
made to Applixware. On its own, Applixware is a very good package,
but to be adopted in the business world, it must be better able to
import and export other formats. In a perfect world, we would all
be using Linux. But since we aren't in that perfect world yet, we
still need to be able to play well with others.</p></div></div>
