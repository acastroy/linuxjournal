    Broadcasting over the Internet&mdash;a look at developing
    applications for this new technology.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158d580.0x16854a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>As the Internet grows up, new
communication needs arise. First, e-mail and FTP were enough for
most people. Then the WWW arrived and people wanted to see
graphics, not just plaintext. Now, even static graphics are not
enough; real-time video and audio are demanded.
</p><p>As communication needs evolve, communication paradigms
originally designed to deal with e-mail and FTP need to evolve too.
A new one that has developed is &ldquo;multicast&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158d580.0x1685608"></a>The Problem</h2></div></div><p>Imagine transmitting an event over the Internet (perhaps a
Linus Torvalds conference), and multicast is not available. A
single source of information, which could be a computer connected
to both the Internet and the video cameras and microphones Linus is
talking to, is transmitting multimedia streams to several hosts
dispersed over the Internet. Of course, traffic should be sent as
efficiently as possible&mdash;the less bandwidth used, the
better.</p><p>With pre-multicast technology, two communication paradigms
are available, both of which are inadequate.</p><p>The first one is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Unicast</em></span>. TELNET, FTP,
SMTP and HTTP are unicast-based protocols with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> source and <span   class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span>
destination. To send to multiple destinations, different
communication paths are needed between the source and each of the
destinations (see Figure 1.a). Therefore, a copy of each audio and
video stream would need to be made and sent separately to each
receiver. Clearly, this is not affordable. Even if you are quick
enough in copying real-time audio and video streams, both your
network and the Internet would collapse. Audio and video are
extremely bandwidth expensive. Obviously, TCP cannot be used in
multicast applications, as it is clearly unicast-oriented.</p><p><a href="3041f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1.</a></p><p>The second choice is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Broadcast</em></span>. The
broadcast paradigm (see Figure 1.b) saves a lot of bandwidth
compared to unicast. If you want to send something to all computers
on your LAN, you don't need a separate copy for each. On the
contrary, only one copy is sent to the wire, and all computers
connected to it receive the copy. This solution is better for our
problem but is still insufficient, as we probably need to broadcast
to only some of our computers, not all. Even worse, it is almost
certain that many hosts interested in your conference will be
outside your LAN. While broadcast performs well inside a LAN,
problems arise when broadcast packets are routed across different
LANs. Thus, broadcast is good for applications and protocols that
don't need to cross LAN limits (such as ARP, BOOTP, DHCP and even
routed), but it is not good enough for our problem. Finally, it is
very likely people want to have more than one video conference at a
time, when only one broadcast address is available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158d580.0x1685a28"></a>The Solution: Multicast</h2></div></div><p>After having looked at the problem, it is apparent we need a
solution that provides the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Allows data to be sent to multiple receivers in an
efficient way, avoiding per-receiver copies.</p></li><li><p>Is not constrained by arbitrary network limits, so
it can reach anyone, anywhere on the Internet.</p></li><li><p>Differentiates between multiple and unrelated
transmissions, so that a computer may know which ones are of
interest for applications.</p></li></ul></div><p>The third point relates well to radio or TV channels (not
cable TV). If you are interested in a particular channel, you tune
your receiver to listen to a particular range of frequencies and
discard the rest.
</p><p>The solution that meets all three requirements is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>multicast</em></span>. Figure 1.c shows that host 1 sends
data only <span   class="emphasis"><em>once</em></span> (i.e., no per-receiver copies
are made) and only hosts interested in this data (hosts 3, 5 and 6)
receive it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158d580.0x1685ef8"></a>Multicast Addresses</h2></div></div><p>The radio/TV example will remain a good starting point for
the rest of the article. In the same way that multiple frequencies
ease the process of recognizing and isolating different TV
channels, multiple multicast addresses ease the process of
recognizing the multicast traffic of interest.</p><p>The range of IP addresses is divided into classes, based on
the higher order bits of the IP address. Multicast addresses are
class D addresses: those starting with the first three bits set to
1 and the fourth set to 0. This means multicast addresses range
from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. This is the range of
&ldquo;frequencies&rdquo; in which you can transmit or listen for traffic.
Each &ldquo;frequency&rdquo; identifies a different and specific multicast
group.</p><p>Some of these multicast addresses are well-known, reserved
for a specific purpose. For instance, 224.0.0.1 is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all-hosts</em></span> group. Just &ldquo;ping&rdquo; this address,
and all multicast-capable hosts on the network should answer. Any
multicast-capable host must join this group at start-up on all its
multicast capable interfaces. 224.0.0.2 is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all-routers</em></span> group, and so on. In any case,
your multicast applications should never send datagrams to
addresses 224.0.0.0 through 224.0.0.255, as they won't be forwarded
across multicast routers. Similarly, you should avoid groups
239.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255 as they are reserved for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>administrative scoping</em></span>. See the &ldquo;Multicast
over TCP/IP HOWTO&rdquo; (included in the Linux Documentation Project)
for further details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158d580.0x16861b8"></a>Configuring Your GNU/Linux Multicast Box</h2></div></div><p>In order to play with multicast, your GNU/Linux box needs
special configuration. Your kernel must be compiled with
<b  >IP:&nbsp;multicasting</b> enabled. This will add
support for the IGMP protocol (Internet group management protocol)
to send and receive multicast traffic. If you keep on playing with
multicast, it is quite likely you will need to use your box as a
multicast router, as old routers do not support multicasting. In
that case, check the HOWTO for several additional compile options
which must be enabled (i.e., say <b  >YES</b>). You will
also need the <span   class="bold"><b>mrouted</b></span> application,
a daemon which instructs the kernel on how to forward multicast
datagrams when acting as a multicast router (mrouter).</p><p>Finally, you need to set a default route for outgoing
multicast datagrams. Assuming the eth0 network interface is to act
as that outgoing route (your application can instruct the kernel to
send its datagrams using a different interface if needed), you'll
need to use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
route add -net 224.0.0.0 netmask 240.0.0.0 dev eth0
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158d580.0x1686478"></a>Writing a Complete Multicast Application</h2></div></div><p>Now that multicast is defined and your hosts are set up, I
will explain how to write multicast applications while developing
one. Its aim is to be both a didactic and useful tool. The reader
needs a basic background in network programming using the sockets
API. <span   class="emphasis"><em>UNIX Network Programming</em></span> by W. Richard
Stevens, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Internetworking with TCP/IP Vol. 3</em></span> by
Douglas E. Comer and the
<span   class="bold"><b>setsockopt</b></span> man page are helpful
references.</p><p>The idea for the application in Listing 1 came from a popular
TV commercial in Spain: a little boy takes his father's mobile
telephone, starts calling numbers randomly and saying: &ldquo;Hi, I'm
Edu. Merry Christmas!&rdquo; His father gulps when he discovers it and,
of course, the lesson is how cheap this company's mobile phone
calls are (in Europe, local calls are quite expensive).</p><p><a href="3041l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>Our program (see Listing 1) will do the same thing: it will
send to the multicast group and port, passed as command-line
arguments, the string &ldquo;Hi, I'm
<span   class="emphasis"><em>name_of_machine</em></span>. Merry Christmas!&rdquo; along with
the time to live (TTL) of the message. The program is short and
simple, but it is also quite useful. I have used it several times
when configuring multicast networks. You can run it on all your
machines to see whether they are sending and/or receiving traffic.
The TTL is very handy when using multicast routers and/or tunnels,
as it makes it easy to determine the lowest TTL needed to reach a
given destination.</p><p>The first lines of the program are the usual
<b  >include</b> statements. I tried to add comments to
point out which functions and/or data structures need them. In the
main function, variable definition and basic initializations are
done in lines 27 to 44. Later, we use a dedicated socket for
sending <span   class="bold"><b>(send_s)</b></span> and another for
receiving <span   class="bold"><b>(recv_s)</b></span>. These sockets
must be <b  >SOCK_DGRAM</b> (UDP), as TCP does not
support the multicast paradigm.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158d580.0x16869f8"></a>Sending Traffic</h2></div></div><p>When multicast was implemented, the sockets layer was
extended a bit to support it. That support came via the
<span   class="bold"><b>setsockopt</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>getsockopt</b></span>
system calls.</p><p>Three of the five new <span   class="emphasis"><em>optnames</em></span> (see the
setsockopt man page) were intended for use when sending data:
<b  >IP_MULTICAST_LOOP</b>,
<b  >IP_MULTICAST_TTL</b> and
<b  >IP_MULTICAST_IF</b>. They are all at the IPPROTO_IP
level.</p><p>If <b  >IP_MULTICAST_LOOP</b> is set, all multicast
packets sent from this socket will be looped back internally by the
kernel. This way, the rest of the applications waiting to receive
traffic for this group will see it just as if it had been received
by the network card. We are not interested in that behavior for our
application, so it is disabled in lines 65 to 69. By default,
loopback is enabled.</p><p>The TTL field of the IP header plays a primary role in
multicasting. Its original role of avoiding problems with packets
being looped forever due to routing errors is kept, but a new one
is added: that field is also associated with a meaning of
&ldquo;threshold&rdquo;. It acts as a delimiter to keep multicast packets
from being forwarded without control across the Internet. You can
establish frontiers by specifying a multicast packet will cross
your multicast router only if its TTL field is greater than a
particular value. This way, you can multicast a conference
restricting its scope to your LAN (TTL of 1), your local site
(TTL&lt;32), your country (TTL&lt;64) or allow it to be
unrestricted in scope (TTL&lt;256). Our test program lets you
specify the TTL on the command line, then sets it using the
<b  >IP_ MULTICAST_TTL</b> option. If none is specified,
TTL 1 is assumed (see lines 52 to 62). If you are using multicast
tunnels or your applications are separated by multicast routers,
you can run the program on both ends by increasing the value of the
TTL field until the two programs &ldquo;see&rdquo; each other. This way, you
can easily discover the minimum TTL necessary for your applications
to communicate.</p><p>If not otherwise specified, outgoing multicast datagrams are
sent following the default multicast route set by the system
administrator. If this is not what you want, you can specify
another output interface for that socket. Our sample program is
quite simple and does not need this feature, so we did not use the
<b  >IP_MULTICAST_IF</b> option. Instead, we let the
kernel choose the correct route. If you need it, write code such
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct in_addr interface_addr;
setsockopt (socket, IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_IF,
   &amp;interface_addr, sizeof(interface_addr));
</pre><p>filling the <b  >interface_addr</b> structure with
a suitable value. If later you want to revert to the original
behavior, just call <b  >setsockopt</b> again using
<b  >INADDR_ANY</b> as the interface field.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158d580.0x1a7f380"></a>Receiving Traffic</h2></div></div><p>Your radio or TV must be tuned to receive the channel you
want to hear. In a similar way, you must &ldquo;tune&rdquo; your kernel so
that it knows which multicast groups are of interest. This is known
as &ldquo;subscribing&rdquo; the host to a particular group. Note it is the
host, not the process, that is subscribed. Processes are bound
using <span   class="bold"><b>bind</b></span> to a particular
multicast group/port pair and must tell the kernel they want to
receive traffic for that group. The kernel then knows it must not
drop packets for that group. When it receives them, it makes copies
for all processes bound to that multicast address and port pair.
When the last process that remains subscribed to the group &ldquo;drops
membership&rdquo;, the kernel stops sending these packets to the upper
layer protocols and ignores them again.</p><p>In short, if you want to receive traffic from a multicast
group, you must take the following steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Create the socket (lines 71 to 74).</p></li><li><p>Bind the group/port (lines 81 to 84).</p></li><li><p>Optionally, use the <b  >SO_REUSEADDR</b>
option (lines 76 to 79), so that more than one process can bind the
same group and port on the same machine, i.e., have multiple
receivers.</p></li><li><p>Join the group (lines 87 to 92).</p></li></ul></div><p>The <b  >IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP</b> option expects a
pointer to a <b  >struct ip_mreq</b>. This structure is
defined in netinet/in.h. The first field,
<b  >imr_multiaddr</b>, contains the group address you
want to join. The second, <b  >imr_interface</b>, holds
the IP address of the interface to which the group will be joined.
This is a key point: membership is associated with both groups
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> interfaces. You do not just join a group;
you join a group <span   class="emphasis"><em>on</em></span> a network interface. If
your host is multi-homed, you can join the same group on all your
network interfaces, on one of them or even on some of them. This
way, the application will get packets sent for that group
<span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> received on that particular interface.
</p><p>Normally, you want to receive traffic for that group and you
don't care which interface received it. In those cases, fill the
<b  >imr_interface</b> field with the
<b  >INADDR_ANY</b> wild card (see line 88).</p><p>When you are done, you might want to drop membership (stop
being a member of that group), although this is not strictly
necessary if you are going to close the socket right afterward. The
kernel will drop membership for you on all groups the socket was
subscribed to when you close it.</p><p>If your process drops membership for a particular group but
keeps the socket bound, it will keep receiving that group's traffic
as long as any other process in the host remains a member. Joining
a multicast group only tells the IP and data link layers (which in
some cases explicitly tells the hardware) to accept multicast
datagrams destined to that group; it is not a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>per-process</em></span> membership, but a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>per-host</em></span> membership.</p><p>The rest is easy; we fork and let the parent send messages
(lines 123 to 137) and the child receive them (lines 104 to 122).
As we told it not to loop back, we do not see our own messages.
Change the <b  >IP_MULTICAST_LOOP</b> option, and you'll
find you are talking to yourself.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x158d580.0x1a7fe80"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Feel free to test, modify and enhance this example program.
