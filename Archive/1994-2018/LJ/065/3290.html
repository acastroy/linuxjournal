    Have you ever wandered near your Linux box in the middle of the
    night,
    only to discover the hard disk working furiously? If you have, or just
    want a way for some task to occur at regular intervals, cron is
    the answer.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1545580.0x163d450"></a></h2></div></div><p>The cron daemon,
<span   class="bold"><b>crond</b></span>, packaged with most Linux
distributions, controls scheduling of regularly occurring jobs.
When started upon entry into multi-user mode, crond scans the
directories /var/spool/cron/crontabs and /etc/cron.d and the file
/etc/crontab for work to do. <span   class="bold"><b>crond</b></span>
then awakens every minute, performs the work its record of jobs
says it should do at that time, mails the output (by default) to
the owning user, then sleeps until the beginning of the next
minute.
</p><p>The implementation of crond packaged with Debian 2.0, the
distribution I used when writing this article, carries the name
Vixie Cron, after Paul Vixie, its author. I will use &ldquo;cron&rdquo; to
refer, variously, to both the crond process and the cron
facility.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1545580.0x163d660"></a>History of cron</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> evolved to enable the
execution of jobs at regular intervals. Have you had occasion to
use the log files in /var/log? Most Linux distributions come with a
ready set of cron jobs to tame those log files. Without cron jobs,
the file system holding /var would eventually fill completely with
log files. The potential uses for cron exceed the small
customizations I have made to my home environment. If you want to
automate something that runs more than once, turn to cron.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1545580.0x163d7c0"></a>How to Use cron</h2></div></div><p>Individual users may use cron to automate tasks. Normally,
all users may make use of cron. If superuser has created
/etc/cron.allow or /etc/cron.deny, then access to the cron facility
depends on the contents of those files. If /etc/cron.allow exists,
your user name must appear in it for you to use cron. If
/etc/cron.deny exists but /etc/cron.allow does not, your user name
must not appear in /etc/cron.deny, or cron will not work for you.
To edit your cron settings, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>crontab</b></span> command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
crontab -e
</pre><p>This will create a cron table, or &ldquo;crontab file&rdquo;, which
cron will read to find work. The crontab command looks first for
the <b  >VISUAL</b> environment variable, then for the
<b  >EDITOR</b> environment variable. It will use the
editor named in those variables to provide editing of crontab
files. Without one of these environment variables set, Debian 2.0's
crontab uses the <span   class="bold"><b>ae</b></span> editor. Other
distributions may have a different default behavior for crontab.
Make the changes you desire, save the file and exit the editor.
</p><p>Why do we not edit the crontab file directly? The reason is
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> requires a specific format
for its job entries. The crontab command performs syntax checking
before allowing a newly edited crontab file to enter circulation.
If the new crontab has a syntax error, crontab complains and asks
if you want to edit again. To protect the crontab files, the
crontab command makes root the owner of the crontab files.</p><p><a href="3290l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>To view your newly edited crontab file, use this
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
crontab -l
</pre><p>The output should look something like Listing 1. Each crontab
entry provides either an environment variable or a time-specific
cron command. <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> sets a few
environment variables automatically. Others, such as
<b  >MAILTO</b>, can be set by the user. Normally, cron
mails the output of each cron job to its owner. If you put the line
<pre     class="programlisting">
MAILTO="fred"
</pre>


in your crontab file, the output of your cron jobs would go to user
fred instead. More likely, you would want to suppress cron output.
If you set MAILTO to null,
<pre     class="programlisting">
MAILTO=""
</pre>


then cron will discard the job output.
</p><p>The fields in a time-specific cron command appear in this
order: minute (0-59 allowed), hour (0-23 allowed), day of month
(1-31 allowed), month (1-12 or names allowed), day of week (0-7 or
names allowed, with both 0 and 7 representing Sunday), and the
command to run. The numerical fields also allow ranges of numbers,
wild cards, lists and methods for running cron jobs at every
<span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span>th interval, such as every third hour. The
asterisk character works as a wild card, representing every
occurrence of the field's value. For details, see the crontab(5)
manual page.</p><p>The example below will run the
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command every minute of the
noon hour on the first day of the month, discarding the
output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MAILTO=""
# Minute Hour Day-Of-Month Month Day-Of-Week
# Command
* 12 1 * * /usr/bin/ls
</pre><p>This next example will run the
<span   class="bold"><b>free</b></span> command every other hour and
mail the output to fred:
<pre     class="programlisting">
MAILTO="fred"
* */2 * * * /usr/bin/free
</pre>


The system-wide crontab, stored in the file /etc/crontab, provides
a slightly different method for running cron jobs. It does not have
a special editor, so you must take extra care when editing it. In
addition, it provides a user name field between the Day-of-Week and
Command fields, to run jobs under a user ID other than root,
without having to create a separate crontab file for that user.
Edit it with your favorite editor and save the changes; cron will
automatically update its job list.

pre-configured cron jobs to help control disk usage. Other
distributions may provide similar help. The Debian
<span   class="bold"><b>dh_installcron</b></span> command will
install these jobs. Normally, you should not need to run this
command&mdash;installing the cron package will take care of it for
you.</p><p>These jobs, located in the file /etc/crontab, use the
<span   class="bold"><b>run-parts</b></span> command to call all the
scripts in directories /etc/cron.daily, /etc/cron.weekly and
/etc/cron.monthly. For the most part, these scripts control disk
usage, compressing and pruning log files in /var/log and cleaning
up after indices from the man(1) command. The package maintainers
who created these jobs configured them to run during the night,
normally a slow time for other system activity. Some of the scripts
generate a lot of disk activity, which can slow other I/O-intensive
jobs. If you want them to run at other times, edit /etc/crontab or
move the scripts among the directories that contain them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1545580.0x163e370"></a>Additional Reading</h2></div></div><p>See the list of references in the sidebar for additional
reading on cron. Additionally, the man page for the
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> facility may prove useful.
<span   class="bold"><b>at</b></span> provides a one-time
job-scheduling facility. If you do not keep your Linux system
running 24 hours per day, you may want to review Anacron, which
does not depend on specific time events to get its work
done.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1545580.0x163e528"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I have provided a brief introduction to the cron facility, a
typical part of Linux and other UNIX operating systems. It will
provide a starting point for time-related work you want your Linux
system to perform. In brief, if you want to schedule repetitive
tasks so as not to type the same commands again and again, use
cron.</p><p><a href="3290s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
