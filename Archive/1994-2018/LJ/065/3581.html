    atsar, ext2resize, ippl and more.

pace. I took a look back at some of the packages I reviewed several
months ago, and noticed many have had significant improvements. One
package, the Ministry of Truth, a job tracking system, has morphed
into a simple way to create databases and tables and make use of
them. The original job tracking database is included and can be
expanded. Other packages haven't made such a drastic metamorphosis,
but have improved. So if you found them lacking back then, take
another look.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>atsar:</b></span><a href="ftp://ftp.atcomputing.nl/pub/tools/linux" target="_self">ftp://ftp.atcomputing.nl/pub/tools/linux/</a></p><p>For those Linux users who have administered SCO boxes or
other systems that have a utility known as the System Activity
Report (SAR), you know what you're missing. For those who haven't,
SAR is a great tool to track your system's health. A clone or port
is long overdue. The way to get the best indication of your
system's health is by putting an entry in crontab to run
<span   class="bold"><b>atsar</b></span> every twenty minutes. This
program will list how resources are being used, so you can
prioritize what to buy to fix any bottlenecks found in the system.
The atsar report lists percentages for user, system, nice and idle.
Armed with this information, you can more easily justify system
expenditures. It requires glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ext2resize:</b></span><a href="http://www.dsv.nl/~buytenh/ext2resize" target="_self">http://www.dsv.nl/~buytenh/ext2resize/</a></p><p>Still in development,
<span   class="bold"><b>ext2resize</b></span> shows a lot of promise.
This utility purports to allow you to resize (shrink or extend) an
existing EXT2 partition. Being the coward that I am and not having
a disk or partition handy with expendable data, I tested only
against a file I created, carefully following the instructions with
the package. I would need to throw in a disk to test it properly.
Problem is, I don't have one. It requires glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ippl:</b></span><a href="http://www.via.ecp.fr/~hugo/ippl" target="_self">http://www.via.ecp.fr/~hugo/ippl/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ippl</b></span> is an IP protocol
logger designed as a replacement for IP Logger, which logs IP
packets. In contrast to <span   class="bold"><b>iplogger</b></span>,
it is highly configurable. It will log any or all TCP, UDP and ICMP
messages using the syslog facility, depending on how you have
configured it. With this available, all you need is a Perl script
or two to search (using <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>)
through the messages and check for anomalous behavior. Crackers
often use scripts that essentially outsmart programs looking for
sequential port scans by doing slow scans over a period of hours or
days. With some as-yet-unwritten scripts, ippl could detect these
scans. Now, if I just knew Perl. It requires glibc and
libpthread.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>galway:</b></span><a href="http://erin.netpedia.net" target="_self">http://erin.netpedia.net/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>galway</b></span> is a small program
that is a step toward becoming a usable web-page creation tool. It
uses pull-down menus to help you create pages. These pull-down
menus aren't complete as of this writing, but should be soon. If
you don't like what you see, it is easily changed. You can add
pull-downs, remove them, change them, or add/delete/change items on
the pull-down menus. Since on any given set of web pages the top
and bottom portions of the page (those containing the headers and
footers) change rarely or very little, this program allows an upper
and lower template to be added (respectively) above and below the
body of the page. It requires guile, guile-gtk and gtk.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>gperiodic:</b></span><a href="http://www.bgw.org/projects/gperiodic" target="_self">http://www.bgw.org/projects/gperiodic/</a></p><p>Got a student just starting out in chemistry who needs a copy
of the periodic table of elements?
<span   class="bold"><b>gperiodic</b></span> doesn't have it all
(valences are missing, for one thing), but it does give the correct
name, atomic number, weight, and boiling and melting points. This
quick reference may be all your budding DuPont needs for a while.
It requires libgtk, libgdk, libglib, libgmodule, libdl, libXext,
libX11, libstdc++, libm and glibc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>syswatch:</b></span><a href="http://www.weirdo.net/scripts" target="_self">http://www.weirdo.net/scripts/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>syswatch</b></span> is a nice utility
that displays in a web browser window what is going on on your
system. System information shown includes uptime, kernel version,
RAM and swap. A second section shows file system information. A
third section displays the output from
<span   class="bold"><b>w</b></span> command. A final section
displays resource hogs based on CPU usage, memory usage, and amount
of time on the processor. The only change I would make is to add an
HTML tag to update the page automatically every minute or so. It
requires a web server that allows CGI scripts (Perl) and a web
browser.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xps:</b></span><a href="http://www.netwinder.org/~rocky/xps-home" target="_self">http://www.netwinder.org/~rocky/xps-home/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xps</b></span> displays a process tree
in an easy-to-read format. Unlike other process tree
viewers/display programs, this one makes good use of diagonal lines
to keep things grouped and on the screen without much scrolling
around. Color is used to denote various states (running, sleeping,
etc.). Double-clicking on a process pops up a window with specifics
on that process and options which allow you to change priorities
(<span   class="bold"><b>renice</b></span>) or send signals to the
process, if you have sufficient permissions. It requires libXmu,
libXm, libXext, libXt, libX11, libSM, libICE and glibc.</p></div></div>
