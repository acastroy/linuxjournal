has improved noticeably since the days of version 5. In keeping
with the high standards of modern distributions, Red Hat Linux 6.0
is relatively easy to install, preconfigured, aesthetic and
functional. It comes with the standard Linux applications
(including Netscape) and also includes a special applications CD,
with over 50 various commercial applications (most of which are
demo versions which expire or are disabled). GNOME (running by
default with the Enlightenment window manager), Red Hat's desktop
environment, is well-configured and attractive. In addition to
aesthetic improvements, Red Hat made some significant technical
changes in its newest distribution, including the complete adoption
of the EGCS (Experimental GNU Compiler System). Still, many things
will be familiar to users of previous Red Hat releases.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17dc580.0x18d4b88"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Red Hat Linux 6.0 comes with three CDs (and a floppy, just in
case), the first being an auto-booting installer which looks rather
like previous Red Hat installers. It presents three installation
options: Workstation-class, Server-class and Custom. The 400+ page
installation guide contains very little information regarding the
installation options, but having tested them, I
<span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> recommend a custom install.</p><p>Before proceeding with any kind of installation, however, the
installer offers a choice of eleven languages which are mostly
implemented (though some need more work than others). These are
mainly just for the installation process, although GNOME does
support a few languages; so if you install in another language for
the fun of it, your system could end up running in it. After
language selection, the installer offers a choice between
installation and upgrade.</p><p><a href="3590f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1.
<span   class="bold"><b>Screen Shot</b></span></a></p><p>Upgrading is a rather quick process; a large part of the
convenience aspect of Red Hat is the ability to upgrade, whether
one is dealing with individual packages (via RPM/GnoRPM) or a
complete system. Upgrading is rather automated compared to
installation, which presents various options.</p><p>The workstation-class installation is quite functional and
easy to use but is not as complete or fun as a custom installation;
KDE, among other things, is noticeably missing. The server-class
installation is meant for servers and will be of little interest
except to network enthusiasts. It is not exactly up-to-date, and
still runs FVWM2 (AnotherLevel) instead of the newer desktop
environments; it is reminiscent of Red Hat releases from quite a
while ago. The custom installation is probably what most users
would want, and is simple enough to make if one knows what hardware
is inside the machine.</p><p>Custom installation allows the user to choose packages either
categorically or one by one; in the latter case, the installer
keeps track of dependencies between packages. The user is also
given the choice of which programs to be launched automatically at
startup, and is required to partition his own drives. A choice of
either Disk Druid or <span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> is
given for partitioning the drives. Disk Druid is menu-driven and
simple enough, as long as one is familiar with partitioning; the
time-tested fdisk is just as adequate. Although both partitioning
programs perform the same task in basically the same way (selecting
partitions, sizes and mount points), using a menuing system seems
to be easier for most people.</p><p>Video configuration can be a bit problematic. Curiously,
although the lists of available monitors and video cards are quite
long, the installer cannot probe for the video card. Probing for a
card instead of querying the user should not be very difficult to
implement, since X can probe successfully. The video mode tests
failed even though my card and monitor were listed, but after
installation, X worked fine. Also, if one could test various
preconfigured monitor frequencies against the standard X test
pattern, a better picture could be had. Since you will presumably
have this Linux system for a while before reinstalling, it would be
worth the effort to have an optimally configured display. Too bad
this option is not available.</p><p>If you do not know your hardware, installation can be a
hang-up. The only thing the installer could successfully detect was
my mouse; everything else had to be entered manually. Again, this
is fine if you know your hardware, and it is probably even safer
than probing. However, new Linux users to whom Red Hat is often
recommended and people who do not know what is inside their
computers might prefer the computer to figure out for itself what
hardware is present. Certain other installers probe successfully,
so accurate probing is possible. Since ease of use has long been
one of Red Hat's main attractions, it seems the installer could
stand to be brought up to a level on a par with the overall quality
of the distribution.</p><p>Despite the need to enter hardware information manually,
installation is not exactly difficult and an experienced user could
reasonably expect to complete an installation in approximately
thirty minutes. Once the installation process is at an end, the
option is presented to have X start up by default at boot time. If
you answer yes, reboot and log in, you will be greeted by a
mysterious footprint on the desktop, shaped oddly enough like a G
with toes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17dc580.0x18d50b0"></a>GNOME</h2></div></div><p>Red Hat has taken an active role in supporting the production
of GNOME, a high-quality desktop environment based entirely on free
software. Red Hat Linux 6.0 installs GNOME on workstation and
custom installations. GNOME is not actually a window manager in
itself&mdash;it is a desktop environment which allows you to use the
compatible window manager of your choice (Enlightenment, by
default).</p><p>One of the particularly nice characteristics of modern
distributions is that their desktop environments come thoroughly
configured. This means you can bring up menus, point and click,
drag and drop, etc. without having to configure the menus, and the
menu options actually correspond to the programs on your system. On
Red Hat Linux 6.0, GNOME is better configured than KDE or
AnotherLevel (FVWM2), both of which menus are incorporated into
GNOME's menuing system. GNOME also has the remarkable program
GnoRPM, which is a Red Hat Package Manager for GNOME. This
graphical program offers a simple point-and-click system for
installing, upgrading, uninstalling, querying, verifying and
searching through RPM packages. In conjunction with LinuxConf and
various control panels, this makes for easy point-and-click
administration and configuration.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17dc580.0x18d5210"></a>Technical Changes</h2></div></div><p>A large part of the improvement Red Hat made from 5.2 to 6.0
comes from the technical changes in the various programs which make
up the distribution. The core of the improvement is the 2.2 kernel
(2.2.5-15 to be exact), which supports more hardware and file
systems and is even better at networking than previous Linux
kernels. It also has better SMP support and countless other
improvements in areas ranging from networking to frame buffers, and
is even more modular and easier to reconfigure and recompile.
Recompilation is less necessary due to the new modular approach.
Developers will likely appreciate that Red Hat has moved completely
to the Experimental GNU Compiler System (EGCS), which offers
advanced platform optimizations, integrated FORTRAN and a
significantly improved C++ compiler. These days, as innovative
hardware solutions push past the limits of conventional desktop
processor speed and storage space, SMP and RAID support are
increasingly valuable and, thanks to the new Linux kernel,
available. In conjunction with Glibc 2.1.1 and the latest stable
versions of various libraries and programs at the time of its
release, Red Hat Linux 6.0 is up to date.</p><p>Security is an ever-present problem with network computers,
and in this distribution, root access via TELNET has been removed
and the X screen automatically locks when the screen saver comes
on. Also, passwords are shadowed and, optionally, use MD5
encryption (as opposed to DES). For convenience, console users do
have access to peripherals and can reboot, although this can be
changed. Security risks are always a hazard, so it is a good idea
to check periodically for recent patches. In fact, a few small
potential security problems shipped with 6.0; the fixes (via RPM)
are on Red Hat's web site, along with a list of rather minor
errata.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17dc580.0x18d5370"></a>Application CD</h2></div></div><p>Included in Red Hat Linux 6.0 and Red Hat EXTRA is an
application CD with over 50 Linux applications, ranging from
developmental software to productivity software, specialized
commercial applications and more. According to the box, the CD is
valued at over $1,000, and perhaps if it were full of commercial
software instead of disabled and expiring demo versions, it would
be worth that much. Nevertheless, the disc is an amazing testament
to the proliferation of applications available for Linux, and some
software packages are mostly or even fully functional while some
don't work at all. The CD should be looked at as a bonus, because
you could just download most of the software over the Net, if you
knew it existed in the first place. The inclusion of commercial
demos with Linux distributions is a good idea, and software vendors
might want to pursue other distributors as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17dc580.0x18d5478"></a>Support and Manuals</h2></div></div><p>In the past, the majority of complaints about Red Hat seem to
have involved the issue of support; perhaps this implies that the
distribution itself leaves little to complain about. This time, Red
Hat stepped up the efforts to provide support to registered users
of Official Red Hat Linux 6.0. This may partially explain the
rather high price of $79.95 for a collection of mostly free
software.</p><p>Included with the Red Hat package is a large bright yellow
slip of paper stating, &ldquo;For Installation Support Go To:
http://support.redhat.com&rdquo;, from which one might surmise the
source for installation support. In order to receive support, one
must first register via Red Hat's web site. The registration
program seems to work, and once registered, a user is entitled to
30 days of installation support via telephone and 90 days of
installation support by way of e-mail. I would certainly expect
that after 90 days, someone would have his system installed.
Actually, support goes a bit further than initial installation; Red
Hat is willing to help in the configuration of printers, sound
cards and other hardware such as floppy and CD-ROM drives. There
was no mention of Ethernet help, though this is usually easier than
dealing with sound cards, so I hope Red Hat intends to help with
this too.</p><p>Installation will take much longer than thirty minutes if you
take the time to read the 400+ page &ldquo;Installation Guide&rdquo; and the
300-page &ldquo;Getting Started Guide&rdquo;. The Installation Guide is a
comprehensive walk-through of the installation process, with a
significant space dealing with system configuration and
administration. The Installation Guide is rather thorough and
contains enough information to turn a neophyte into a competent
administrator of his own system. The Getting Started Guide is
smaller, simpler and a bit friendlier. It covers many aspects of
Enlightenment and GNOME, X, shell usage, administration,
configuration and the like. Red Hat calls it &ldquo;easy-to-read&rdquo;--that
is a fair assessment, to say the least.</p><p>In the event that someone finds 30 days of phone support, 90
days of e-mail support and 700 pages of textual support inadequate,
Red Hat offers various commercial support packages ranging in price
from $2,995 to $60,000. Obviously, these cover more than basic
installation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17dc580.0x18d5688"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Red Hat Linux 6.0 is a modern, up-to-date, flexible
distribution which finds itself at home in a number of areas
ranging from small servers to home desktops to the business world.
Many businesses and institutions rely on Red Hat, as do countless
home users. At the very least, it has recent versions of packages
and puts libraries in the right places, so things work. It does
have a commercial feel to it&mdash;you <span   class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> when a
machine is running Red Hat. Also, it does not take a minimalist
approach, so it could be a bit more complicated than a home user
might want&mdash;some might even find it a bit bulky. Actually, for
GNOME/Enlightenment to function in a timely way, 32MB of RAM seems
inadequate. However, the distribution on the whole is reliable and
functional. The price is a bit painful, so one might want to
consider the many alternatives. But, if you need to be sure of a
functional system with phone and e-mail support, manuals,
applications and a Red Hat bumper sticker, the price may be worth
it.</p></div></div>
