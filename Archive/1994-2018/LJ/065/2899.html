number of devices supported by Linux. If you ever want to know how
device drivers work or add kernel support for a particular device,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Device Drivers</em></span> is the book for you. Be
forewarned, though; if you are not comfortable with C, you won't
understand the examples that are amply spread throughout. Also note
that no matter how good a Linux device driver book really is, it
will become outdated simply due to the rate at which the Linux
kernel is developed. Mr. Rubini is aware of this fact, and
throughout the book, he generously notes the differences between
kernel versions when applicable. He even goes so far as to devote
an entire chapter to recent developments in the Linux kernel.
</p><p>I found <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Device Drivers</em></span> to be very
complete in its description of the Linux kernel versions for which
it was written&mdash;2.0.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> to 2.1.43, which were
the most recent at the time of its initial printing.</p><p>This book is roughly divided into two parts. Part One
includes chapters 1 through 10 and starts out with a simple &ldquo;Hello
World&rdquo; module, then moves on to describe how kernel modules are
properly set up. Part One continues through the entire gambit of
modular device programming needed to write a full-featured driver
for a character-oriented device.</p><p>Since the audience may not have any experience writing
modular device drivers, a chapter on debugging techniques is
included. I found these to be quite useful, and they helped me to
accelerate the development of several kernel drivers I was writing.
One thing I did find baffling is the order in which several
chapters are presented. The one that stands out most is Chapter 10,
which deals primarily with portability issues. This chapter could
have been presented earlier in the book to help maintain the flow
the author had sustained early on.</p><p>I found Chapter 9 to be the most useful and the most fun; it
covers interrupt handling. To help facilitate the reader's
understanding of how interrupts are processed and handled, it
requires the reader to modify his parallel port by connecting two
pins together. (The parts can be found at your local computer
hardware store for about $3.) Once my parallel port was modified, I
was able to make full use of the examples. Mr. Rubini takes a
difficult subject and breaks it into manageable parts. He does this
quite effectively, moving through very technical topics with great
fluidity.</p><p>Part Two of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Device Drivers</em></span> covers
more advanced topics. These include block drivers and network
interfaces, and how one would write device drivers specific to
them. Part Two also covers memory management and device access on
peripheral buses such as the PCI and ISA bus. It also delves deeper
into topics briefly mentioned in Part One.</p><p>Also in Part Two is something I have rarely seen described in
other Linux kernel books&mdash;a description of the actual physical
layout of the kernel source. Mr. Rubini approaches this by
following the path in which the kernel boots from the first
architecture-independent function
(<span   class="bold"><b>start_kernel</b></span>) through the
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> process. This is also one of
those chapters which might have been better placed earlier in the
book, but no matter where it's located, its inclusion is greatly
appreciated.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Device Drivers</em></span> serves many
different purposes. This book will always serve the developer who
wants to expand the number of devices which work with Linux. Also,
you need not have the desire to write a device driver to learn
something from it. All you need is an interest in knowing more
about how devices work with the kernel to provide the services and
stability we want. It is a great piece of work, where the one major
drawback is time&mdash;this book was published in February of 1998.

I urge Mr. Rubini to follow up with a second edition, and I plan to
be first in line for my copy.</p></div></div>
