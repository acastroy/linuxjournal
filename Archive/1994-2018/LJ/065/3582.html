Christoph Dalitz, May 1999. In it, Mr. Dalitz mentions the
&ldquo;tkdiff&rdquo; utility, but seems to base his observations on an old
version. I wanted to alert you to a couple of significant changes,
which may impact tkdiff's usefulness to some users.</p><p>Thanks to much work by Bryan Oakley, 3.03 (the latest
released version) contains many features and enhancements relative
to the more ubiquitous 2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and
1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> releases.</p><p>One change in particular addresses the author's observation
that &ldquo;tkdiff can be invoked only from the shell prompt because it
requires file names as command-line arguments.&rdquo; This is no longer
the case. If tkdiff is invoked without arguments, it will pop up a
dialog box and prompt you for file names (via text-entry widgets
coupled to optional file-selector widgets). As such, tkdiff is now
a suitable candidate for being launched from a toolbar or similar
mechanism which eschews the command line.</p><p>Relative to the observation that tkdiff has &ldquo;no external man
page, which occasionally makes it inconvenient to get usage
information&rdquo;, I would like to point out that the on-line help does
come up automatically, if invalid command-line parameters are used.
This is still inconvenient, but better than having to explicitly
invoke the on-line help system in order to see the help
text.</p><p>Lastly, on a related note, I've turned over maintenance
responsibilities for tkdiff to Damon Poole of Ede Development
Enterprises. Damon graciously volunteered to maintain and enhance
the code on an Open Source basis. The official tkdiff home page is
now at http://www.ede.com/free/tkdiff/index.html, from which this
3.02 release can be obtained. Thank you.</p><p>&mdash;John M.

support and thoughts. I was prompted to write after reading the
June <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It strikes me that Linux
is at a crossroads of sorts, where identity and maturity need
definition and direction. This point was made in the articles on
Linux standards and were reflective of the development community
and its needs. However, there is another perspective, that of the
consumer or end user.</p><p>I consider myself to be in this latter community. Labeled as
such, I do not believe that the Linux community has come to terms
with an identity or maturity. As an end user, I am amazed at the
wealth of information and capability that has been developed to
date. In many ways, this reflects very well on the Linux community
and should be a great source of pride&mdash;well done. Nevertheless, the
question is where to go from here. The &ldquo;here&rdquo; is subject to
debate; however, I would argue that the &ldquo;here&rdquo; is further
adoption by end users like myself.</p><p>We are all well aware of Linux's success as a development
platform, Internet web server, enterprise mail and file server, and
specialized supercomputer platform. Unfortunately, these
applications represent a very limited set of users. What about the
end user who operates in the world of Microsoft today? These users
have very different needs than those of a development community.
These users typically see the computer as an appliance. The
computer does things that provide benefit to the user. This type of
user sees the computer like most people see an automobile&mdash;get me
from point A to point B, but don't ask me to understand how it
happens. I can sense some developers community taking great pride
in using a tool that requires great skill to master. Unfortunately,
end users, for the most part, are not interested in acquiring those
skills.</p><p>I'll use my own experience to illustrate the point. I've gone
from a distribution of Linux by InfoMagic in 1995 through Red Hat
5.0, 5.2, Caldera OpenLinux 2.2, and a soon-to-arrive distribution
of Mandrake 6.0. In all of this, I have not yet abandoned my
Windows. This reflects two important limitations of Linux for me.
First, the lack of user-friendly applications, and second, a lack
of confidence in using the operating system. Limitation one is
becoming less important with the maturity of KDE and the
availability of Netscape, WordPerfect, StarOffice and Applixware.
This fall's release of Corel Office should be a watershed event.
Nonetheless, limitation two is still daunting.</p><p>As I write this, I have just returned from the bookstore with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a Nutshell</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Learning the
bash Shell</em></span> from O'Reilly. Thank God for O'Reilly! These
books and others are part of my growing Linux collection as I try
to understand what the system does. For example, why does the
installation of Metro X cause conflict with the X server as
distributed by Caldera? Why do I have to apply a print offset
correction to produce centered text from WordPerfect? Why does the
configuration of printers using Caldera's COAS seem so difficult
and problematic? Why, when I follow the instructions for building a
new kernel, does the kernel not work? These and other problems have
haunted me as I try to use Linux from an end user
perspective.</p><p>My point here should be obvious and simple: these types of
issues are not a concern when I use Windows. If the Linux community
wants to see greater user adoption, then the community needs to
think like an end user. Trust me in saying that I am an activist
end user, having spent hundreds of hours reading and learning.
However, unlike me, most end users will expect simplicity,
reliability and utility. Linux today can deliver reliability;
simplicity and utility are not part of the equation. To put it in
perspective, if my mother asked me to recommend a computer, my
answer would be a Wintel machine because I could walk her through
most problems over the phone. With Linux, that would not be
possible.</p><p>In sum, I think the Linux community needs to assess which
direction it wants to go in&mdash;remaining a specialist operating
system supporting networking and unique applications, or becoming
more of an appliance operating system that users can operate
confidently. The time to solidify an identity is now, and the
opportunity to come of age will always be timeless.</p><p>&mdash;Mark H.

of <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> in the June issue. I've
been exposed to awk in a hard-core UNIX setting (designing SRAM
circuit layout for Motorola), but have not used it myself. Now I
design textiles on the SGI platform (not so far from chip layout as
you might think) and need to manipulate text files. I run LinuxPPC
on my PCC PowerCenter 120 Macintosh clone at home to practice UNIX
for work. I'll lean on Mr. Iacona's article, his clear,
well-commented example code and helpful glossary with confidence.
I'm dying to get the O'Reilly books and take on more. A clear,
usable, focused treatment of a daunting subject; well-edited, too.
Continue to set your standards high.</p><p>&mdash;Four Hewes four@bway.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbcc580.0xcc4ce8"></a>Kernel Korner</h2></div></div><p>The information in this month's Kernel Korner (&ldquo;IP Bandwidth
Management&rdquo; by Jamal Hadi Salim, June 1999) reminds all of us that
there is yet another dimension to the &ldquo;free-ness&rdquo; offered to
Linux users: not only the code and applications in development, but
also Linux ISP's.</p><p>These ISPs are affecting our ability to move
<span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span>ly. Why? QoS (Quality of Service) is
essentially the end of all-you-can-eat Internet access&mdash;no more
monthly flat rates. Oh sure, there's the bare-bones rate, but
that's <span   class="emphasis"><em>bare</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>bare</em></span> bones.
Instead, the more we are willing to pay, the more our ISP will
shove down our lines. What a fair world!</p><p>It's a double-whammy. I can remember the good old days (i.e.,
three years ago) when we criticized telco's for ripping us off
(after all, the customer is considered &ldquo;the last mile&rdquo;); now,
ISP's will also be subject to our scorn (if they're not already),
as will the host client/servers (i.e., those Linux boxes we adore
so much).</p><p>Sure, QoS implementation is not so much a question of &ldquo;if&rdquo;
but &ldquo;when&rdquo; (it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> inevitable, my
friend). But my teeth gnash at the thought of this implementation
hard-coded into the Linux kernel.</p><p>&mdash;John K. Joachim Joachimj@usa.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbcc580.0xcc50b0"></a>Rave</h2></div></div><p>I've been a subscriber for a few years but still consider
myself a newbie. So far, my faltering steps toward ever greater
Linux mastery are consistently rewarded by finding out just how
rich and robust an OS Linux is. Your magazine really helps; it's
great to feel like I'm part of such a community as
<i  >LJ</i> serves. Thank you and your staff for
sweating the little stuff.</p><p>&mdash;Jamie Matthews mattja@iglobal.net</p></div></div>
