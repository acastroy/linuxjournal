<h1 class="title">Would You Like to Play a Linux Game?</h1>

<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">A look at several games native to Linux. By Marcel Gagné</h2>

<p>
Don't worry, I'm not trying to get you to play <em>Global Thermonuclear
War</em>,
since as we all know, the only way to win is not to play. And we want to
play. Okay, enough with the mandatory classic movie references.
</p>

<p>
There are, of course, tons of games for the Linux platform if you're willing
to install Steam. For the sake of this article, however, I want to show you
some games that are available native to Linux—none of this firing up Java
so you can play something on your Ubuntu, or Fedora, or Debian or whatever
your personal flavor of Linux happens to be.
</p>

<p>
I also want to stay away from the classics. Sure, I know, <a href="http://www.frozen-bubble.org"><em>Frozen
Bubble</em></a> is awesome and always has been awesome. Ditto for
<a href="https://www.supertux.org"><em>SuperTux</em></a> or
<a href="https://supertuxkart.net/Main_Page"><em>SuperTuxKart</em></a>. They're all fantastic, and if you don't know those games, 
be sure to check them out after you finish reading this. In fact, if you
fire up your distribution's software center and search the repository, you're
going to find a ton of games. I'm writing this on a computer running Kubuntu
18.04, and <a href="https://userbase.kde.org/Discover">Discover</a>, the default software center, has a big section dedicated
to games (Figure 1).
</p>
<div class="caption">

<p class="caption">Figure 1. Discover is the Kubuntu and Plasma default software center.</p>

<p>
That said, I want to take you out of the classic Linux comfort zone for games
and show you something you may not have considered. In short, if you've got
the itch to try something new, I may very well have a way for you to
scratch that itch. While looking around for great game ideas, I started off
scouring the web for anything I might have missed in recent days or weeks. So
much of what I found was either oldies and goldies (hello again, <em>Frozen
Bubble</em>) or Steam. And then, I tripped over <a href="https://itch.io">itch.io</a>, a place I had somehow
totally missed before.
</p>

<p>
Here's a short introduction. <a href="https://itch.io">itch.io</a> is a website for indie game designers to
share their passion with the public. You can download a game, pay what you
like (or can afford) and communicate with the developer as the game matures.
The nature of the site is going to seem very familiar to anyone who has been
in the open-source universe for any length of time. There's a lot of
releasing early and some releasing often. Because players can interact
directly with developers, you can influence the design of games you love.
</p>

<p>
Here's another cool thing. The site, like Steam, has an app you can
download and install on your Linux system that acts as a storefront for all
the games, as well as a place to track, install and run said
games. They maintain DEB packages for Ubuntu and Debian derivatives, RPMs for
Red Hat/Fedora and openSUSE, AUR packages for Arch Linux distros, and there's even
something for the Gentoo crowd. Figure 2 shows a look at the storefront opened to Linux games. It's a veritable gold mine of new gaming
opportunities for the Linux lover in you.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="itch.io storefront" src="12531f2.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. The itch.io Storefront and App</p>
</div>

<p>
I'll take two seconds and mention that you also can search for and install
Windows and macOS games as well, for people who still run those. The
app also lets you search by whether the games are completely free (or pay
what you like), popular, new, highly rated or of a particular genre (such as
FPS or RPG). To the right of the app, you can choose to organize your game
library as you see fit and launch the games from there.
</p>

<p>
The games are listed in a grid on the right. Scroll up or down to find
something you like, then click a title to learn more about it. If you
simply hover over a particular game, a small windowed description panel will
pop up; from there, on some of the games, you can choose to play a game
trailer (Figure 3).
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Game Screen" src="12531f3.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Hover over a title to show a small descriptive pop-up</p>
</div>

<p>
When you click a title for the full description, look to the far right
below the game thumbnail for an Install button. Directly below that,
depending on the game, you may see an option to tip the creator for his or
her
work on creating the game (Figure 4). When you are ready, click Install,
and everything happens in the background. Assuming you haven't wandered away
from the description, the Install button will turn into a Launch button from
which you can, you guessed it, launch the game.  
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Install Screen" src="12531f4.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 4. Install a game, and maybe give a little something to the creator.</p>
</div>

<p>
Eventually, you'll install several games, and your games all will appear
under the Library button to the left of the itch.io app. Directly below that,
there's a collections button, as each game you download can be added to your
personal collection where you organize things as you see fit. Whether you
look at the entire library or a defined collection of game types, now it's
just a matter of clicking the Launch button.
</p>

<p>
When you launch a game, a configuration dialog appears offering you a
variety of screen resolutions on the left from which you can select what
works best for your particular monitor (Figure 5). Directly below the
resolution list is a check box that allows you to choose either full-screen
(the default) or windowed play. On the right is the graphics quality listed
from Fastest through to Fantastic. Needless to say, fantastic graphics may
deliver slower performance on lesser systems. Use what works best for you.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Screen Resolution" src="12531f5.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 5. Each game lets you select both screen resolution and quality.</p>
</div>
<p>
Click OK and let the fun begin!
</p>

<p>
Let me show you a few games that I found and enjoyed, starting with
<a href="https://denki.itch.io/autonauts"><em>Autonauts</em></a>. At first glance, <em>Autonauts</em> looks like a
<em>Minecraft</em>-ish sandbox game,
and certainly there are some elements of that—you collect resources, craft
things, build and so on. <em>Autonauts</em>, short for
<em>Automationatics</em>, are
artificially intelligent robots who travel the universe looking for worlds
whose development they can assist (Figure 6).
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Program Screen" src="12531f6.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 6. Programming a new robot to find and cut down trees.</p>
</div>

<p>
They take advantage of local resources to build a basic infrastructure from
which they can build other robots. When new robots come online, the more
advanced Autonauts can train them to perform tedious tasks like collecting
resources and building stuff. You do this by having new workers watch you
and record what you do, so that they can then be left to operate on their
own. As the society evolves, increasingly complex workerbots can perform
increasingly complex tasks. The idea is to continue churning out robots,
automating everything that can be automated so as eventually to create a
modern, efficient society.
</p>

<p>
I took a break from playing to chat with Aaron from Denki Games, the creator
of <em>Autonauts</em>. The game has a Discord link where you can chat with the creator
and with other players, and that's where I found Aaron.  I asked him what he
thought of the itch.io concept, and he answered
"We've known about Itch for a while. I'm more interested in experimental
than mainstream games in general, so I'd come across it long before we started
<em>Autonauts</em>."
</p>

<p>
When I told him that it reminded me of the Steam store and front-end app, he
said, "I think that's a fair comparison. For us, it allowed us to experiment
with our ideas without the harsh, critical spotlight of Steam Early Access.
People are a lot more forgiving on Itch. :-)"
</p>

<p>
Realism is great, but I don't need my wargames to have the smell of soldier
sweat mixed with blood and mud. That's why I loved <a href="https://n7t.itch.io/attack-on-toys"><em>Attack On Toys</em></a>, a
wargame third-person shooter where you fight with plastic toy soldiers. You
command the green army against the tan army. There is strategy involved as
you place your defences before each battle, so it's not just shoot and hope
for the best. There are different vehicles you can ride in, including an
airplane, and different weapons. The enemy also has a big mechanical
soldier/robot that you have to defeat. The action takes place in a large
room, across tables and chairs and bookcases (Figure 7). It's really kind
of awesome if, like me, you're still six years old on the inside.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Attack on Toys" src="12531f7.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 7. Taking to the skies in <em> Attack on Toys</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>
Then, there's <a href="https://thomasda.itch.io/naufrage"><em>Naufrage</em></a>, a bizarre adventure without rules. The game opens
with you dropping a coin into an arcade machine, and suddenly you are
following the coin and dropped onto a mysterious island. Ahead of you is a
silent amusement park, shrouded in darkness, with a silent ferris wheel
beckoning you (Figure 8). As you explore this place, you soon
discover you're not alone, although you wander in solitude. A wonderfully
creepy soundtrack accompanies you as you decipher puzzles, read cryptic
messages and follow signs that are often anything but helpful. It's frankly
hard to explain <em>Naufrage</em>—a French word meaning
"shipwreck"—but it's
definitely worth the peaceful yet foreboding journey across and around this
island.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Island World" src="12531f8.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 8. The Mysterious Island World of <em>Naufrage</em></p>
</div>

<p>
What I love about <em>Naufrage</em> is the nearly complete absence of rules. Using
either cursor keys, or the classic WASD to move and spacebar to jump, the
entire point of the game is to figure it out as you go along.
</p>

<p>
Although I enjoyed the experience, it did make me wonder about the commercial
possibilities for some of these games. Like many open-source projects past
and present (but mostly past), games on itch.io seemed to be designed to
scratch a developer's itch. Never mind whether the game was going to
make somebody rich—much of what I encountered seemed to come from a place
where the desire to make something spring from that inner-creative place was
powered by the thought that somewhere out there, other kindred spirits might
enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
You see, the independent and experimental nature of the site means you're
going to find games for your Linux system that you aren't likely to run
across anywhere else. Are you ready to make $7.50 an hour, actually fighting
other employees for a promotion only to face off against a boss who literally
happens to be your boss? Try <a href="https://an-studios.itch.io/minimum-wrage"><em>Minimum WRage</em></a>.
How about an interactive story
about gay girls playing baseball and learning about love (<a href="https://brianna-lei.itch.io/butterfly-soup"><em>Butterfly Soup</em></a>)? Or
a horror version of Arthur the cartoon aardvark (<a href="https://varunramesh.itch.io/arthurs-nightmare"><em>Arthur's
Nightmare</em></a>)? There's
also a bizarre game that drops you into a strange world of M.C. Escher
architecture to discover...who knows what (<a href="https://nusan.itch.io/fragments-of-euclid"><em>Fragments of
Euclid</em></a>). Should
you just want to burn off a little tension, choose one of the many first-person
shooters, like <a href="https://rexuiz.itch.io/rexuiz-fps"><em>Rexuiz</em></a>, and try your best to stay alive for more than a few
seconds.
</p>

<p>
The selection is huge, and I feel like I've just touched the tip of the
proverbial iceberg. Some are silly and just plain fun, and others will have
your heart pounding. There also are some pretty disturbing and occasionally
terrifying titles in there, so make sure you read the descriptions before
installing anything—unless you're one of the brave ones, without fear.
Another surprise, for me at least, was the large number of Otome games like
<a href="https://asphodelquartet.itch.io/blind-griffin"><em>The Blind
Griffin</em></a> (Figure 9). For the uninitiated, as I was, these are
anime-style and story-based games aimed at women (otome is Japanese for
"maiden").

<p>
Don't be afraid to venture outside the classics available via popular
Linux distribution repositories or Steam. People have grown used to thinking of
Steam as the place to go for great games on Linux, and it makes sense given the
quality of those offerings. Steam even has its own Linux distribution, so
it's definitely playing in our court—most of the time. But beyond those
repos and Steam's catalog of games, I'm happy to report that there's another
world where independent developers create games and chat with their fans on
Discord channels.
</p>

<p>
You should really check it out.
