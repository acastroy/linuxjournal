<h1 class="title">Crossing Platforms: a Talk with the Developers Building Games for
Linux</h1>


<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Games for Linux are booming like never before. The revolution comes
courtesy of cross-platform dev tools, passionate programmers and community
support. By K.G. Orphanides</h2>

<p>
In the last five years, the number of mainstream games released for Linux has
increased dramatically, with thousands of titles now available. These range
from major AAA releases, such as <em>Civilization VI</em> and <em>Deus Ex:
Mankind Divided</em>,
to breakout indie hits like <em>Night in the Woods</em>.
</p>

<p>
For this article, I spoke to different developers and publishers to discover the shape of the Linux
games market and find out what's driving its prodigious growth.
</p>
<div class="caption">

<p class="caption">Figure 1. Multi-award-winning comedy adventure game <em>Night in the Woods</em> is one of many games simultaneously released on Linux, macOS and Windows, thanks to development tools that can build all three platforms.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Why Develop Games for Linux?</h3>

<p>
Support for Linux has boomed with the introduction of cross-platform
development tools that make it comparatively easy to release titles on
multiple operating systems. Perhaps more important, almost all the
developers I spoke to personally support the Open Source movement, even if
their games are proprietary.
</p>

<p>
For Zack Johnson, creative director of <a href="http://asymmetric.net/games.html">asymmetric</a>'s stick-figure comedy RPG,
<em>West of Loathing</em>, the game's origins as a spin-off from popular browser game
<em>Kingdom of Loathing</em> played a significant role.
</p>

<p>
"There was a vocal contingent of original <em>Kingdom of Loathing</em> players who
urged us to [release a Linux version]", he said. "We knew we'd be able to get
information and support from them during development, so it seemed like a
worthwhile thing to do."
</p>

<p>
His experiences making an online game also helped form that decision: "My
first game project was built on the LAMP stack, so I wouldn't have a career
without open-source software. And just in general, it's hard to understate
its importance to the fundamental underpinnings of the internet."
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Ad Choices Symbol" src="12523f2.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 2. New Britannia, the online world created for Portalarium's <em>Shroud of the Avitar</em>, has been accessible to Linux users since its early pre-Alpha releases.</p>
</div>

<p>
At <a href="https://www.shroudoftheavatar.com/?page_id=68618">Portalarium</a>, the company behind Richard "Lord British" Garriott's latest
fantasy RPG epic, <em>Shroud of the Avatar</em>, tech director Chris Spears says the
drive to support Linux came from within: 
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Like most game development studios,
there are a lot of Linux advocates in the office. When we ended up choosing
an engine that had support for Linux, it seemed like a no-brainer to support
Linux.
</p>

<p>
Also, while the gaming audience for Linux is a fairly small market, they are
passionate, typically more hard-core gamers, which matches up directly with
what we want in our audience! We're a bit of a thinking person's
game, and that meshes exceptionally well and appeals more to the Linux crowd
than most other games.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="http://finji.co">Finji</a>'s 2017 indie hit <em>Night in the Woods</em>—a coming-of-age comedy set in a
run-down industrial town and starring an animated cat called Mae
Borowski—was built in the Unity game engine. The heart of its complex narrative system
and branching dialog choices is <a href="https://www.secretlab.com.au/yarnspinner">The Secret Lab's Yarn
Spinner</a>, released
under an MIT license.
</p>

<p>
Programmer Jon Manning says that "open source is what made Yarn Spinner, the
narrative engine inside <em>NITW</em>, as featureful as it needed to be to ship the
game. We're huge fans, and we'd love to see more people contributing
to both games, game engines and tools to help game developers build their
visions."
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Yarn Spinner" src="12523f3.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 3. Yarn Spinner, available as Unity plugin, allows developers to create and track complex narrative choices.</p>
</div>

<p>
Lottie Bevan of <a href="http://weatherfactory.biz">Weather Factory</a>, the studio behind Lovecraftian mystery card
game <em>Cultist Simulator</em>, speaks highly of Linux fans: 
</p>

<blockquote><p>
We were impressed with
the Linux community back when we were at [the team's previous employer]
Failbetter—they were our smallest platform demographic, but they were by
far the most helpful and the most technically aware. Linux users seem to
understand that as they're so few it's not a necessary biz decision to
support Linux, and therefore are quite appreciative and helpful if you do!
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
What Makes It Possible?</h3>

<p>
Many of the developers I spoke to emphasized the importance of
cross-platform development tools in general and of the Unity game engine in
particular. Here's Chris Spears of Portalarium speaking of their decision to
use Unity:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We chose Unity 3D as our engine, and it has native support for Linux.
While it isn't quite as simple as just
checking a box that says "Support Linux", it is orders of magnitude easier
than having to build our own engine to support multiple platforms. As a game
company, most of our tech staff was already Linux-savvy, and more than a third
of our engineers run Linux as their primary development OS.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Weather Factory's Lottie Bevan agrees: "Unity takes care of around 95% of the
problems we'd have otherwise had to deal with, which is invaluable for a
two-person microstudio!"
</p>

<p>
The <em>West of Loathing</em> team members at asymmetric also are fans of the game engine,
which has supported Linux as a target platform since 2011 and has had a Linux
version of its development environment available since 2015.
</p>

<p>
"We used the Unity engine to build <em>West of Loathing</em>, so right from the start,
we had support for all the essential technology", says programmer Victor
Thompson. "I do not have any particular knowledge about Linux! I used a
couple different distributions in the distant past, but that was strictly
for maintaining personal mail and web servers."
</p>

<p>
Although many core tools and libraries are cross-platform, a game's
development strategy ideally should be designed from the ground up with Linux
support in mind. 
</p>

<p>
When <a href="http://www.lizardcube.com">Lizard Cube</a> was developing its lush hand-drawn remake of Westone Bit
Entertainment's classic platform game <em>Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap</em>, director
Omar Cornut says:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We made all the data formats portable. Even if it
meant, for example, using free software, such as a portable video player, which
is very poorly optimized from a run-time point of view. But the simplicity of
not maintaining different exports and proprietary players was really worth
it. And we made all the tooling portable.
</p>

<p>
I'm heavily using my free software library, Dear ImGui, which allowed us
to make a portable tooling UI. In fact, the game rendering itself is piped
through Dear ImGui. This tooling even works on consoles—which aren't
POSIX systems and are not supported by traditional UI toolkits.
</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Wonder Boy" src="12523f4.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 4. When they created a remake of <em>Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap</em>, Lizard Cube's developers worked with cross-platform systems from the very start.</p>
</div>

<p>
<a href="https://kitsunegames.com">Kitsune Games</a>' roguelike <em>MidBoss</em>, in which a lowly imp possesses other
monsters to gain their powers, similarly supported Linux from early on. "We
got a lot of requests for a Linux version during development", says studio
founder Emma 'Eniko' Maassen-Yarrow. She adds,
"The game was also built on Ethan Lee's FNA library, and after talking to him
at some events we got the impression that the Linux gaming community is very
good to developers who port to Linux, so we wanted to reward that."
</p>


<p>
Like many developers, she bought in expert assistance when it was needed:
"The FNA library [an open-source reimplementation of the Microsoft XNA Game
Studio 4.0 Refresh libraries] made the whole process pretty painless. We also
hired Ethan to help us with the ports, and if you're working on an XNA/FNA
game, I highly recommend that. In fact, we liked it so much that we've been
porting our new custom game-making framework to use FNA!"
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="MidBoss" src="12523f5.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 5. Kitsune Games' roguelike <em>MidBoss</em> relied on an open-source
reimplementation of Microsoft XNA Game Studio libraries to bring it to
Linux.</p>
</div>

<p>
Porting specialist <a href="https://www.feralinteractive.com/en">Feral
Interactive</a> highlights developments in graphics
technologies as being particularly important. Feral PR manager Mary Musgrove
says:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
In recent years, Vulkan has
made a huge difference, allowing us to make performance improvements that
weren't available to us in OpenGL.
</p>

<p>
In terms of process, we build a lot on our own work. Internally, we have a
set of unified libraries that we use across games (and sometimes platforms)
that mean that no one port is entirely standalone. We have built up a strong
core of knowledge over the years, meaning that our teams benefit from the
learning gained from earlier projects.
</p>

<p>
Externally, our contributions to open-source projects and thus the wider
Linux ecosystem have had a long-term benefit. For example, Feral developers
have to date made 50+ commits to Mesa drivers, and we also fix issues in
Khronos' Vulkan layers.
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
What Are the Challenges?</h3>

<p>
Even with tools that can publish to Linux as easily as to Windows, there 
still are overheads associated with supporting an entire additional operating
system.
</p>

<p>
asymmetric's Victor Thompson says:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The main challenge was supporting
(as in actually testing) a wide enough variety of Linux distributions. As the
person most directly responsible for this aspect of testing, I had to get
creative with a variety of USB install and test distributions.
</p>

<p>
We did have a couple of snags, both of which appeared as bugs found by
users. In those cases, the users reporting the bug were helpful in finding
out what was happening. One case I remember was caused by not setting an
appropriate locale for the game (important because we read text from files,
and numbers that look like "1.000" mean different things depending on locale
settings).
</p>

<p>
I also (re)discovered the joy of alternate window managers, some of which
alter the way our game will interact with the graphics driver. We had to
scramble to add a graphics option for users who had this issue, and I still
don't know what a Unity game can do to get around them automatically.
</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="West of Loathing" src="12523f6.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 6. Quality assurance testing proved to be a key issue for ensuring
proper Linux support in asymmetric's <em>West of Loathing</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>
Quality assurance is a recurring issue. At Portalarium, the <em>Shroud of the
Avatar</em> dev team has automated its builds for Windows, macOS and Linux, but
"there are occasionally a few hiccups due to differences in the graphics
library and shaders, but not too many that we have to address specifically
for Linux platforms. Probably the biggest workload for supporting Linux has
fallen on our tiny QA team since they have to test all new versions of the
game on each platform."
</p>

<p>
Wube Software, the makers of manufacturing, logistics and resource
management game <a href="https://www.factorio.com"><em>Factorio</em></a>, encountered some specific difficulties with
cross-platform implementation due to the deterministic nature of the game's
automated factories and processes. CTO Michal 'Kovarex' Kovarik says the team
found that across different platforms:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Some compilers implement certain
functions in different ways, causing calculations to vary over time.
</p>

<p>
It turned out that, in C++, basic trigonometric functions (sin, cos, asin,
atan, and so on) are not guaranteed to give the same results across different
platforms. We are not talking about precision here, it is about getting the
same (though possibly imprecise) outcomes.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This meant that cross-platform multiplayer wouldn't work. In the end, Kovarex
wrote custom implementations of these functions to produce consistent
gameplay for all users.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
Porting</h3>

<p>
An alternative to in-house parallel development is to bring in a porting
specialist. Two of the most notable porting studios for Linux games are Feral
Interactive and <a href="http://www.aspyr.com">Aspyr Media</a>, both of which started life as Mac porters before
introducing Linux titles as their client developers began to take an interest
in the platform.
</p>

<p>
Communications director Jonathan Miller says:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
At Aspyr, we are Linux believers. In the past year, we have released
<em>Observer</em> and <em>InnerSpace</em> on Linux,
with <em>Next Up Hero</em> slated for release later this year. In addition, we
released six DLC packs and the Rise and Fall expansion for <em>Civilization
VI</em>.
With the proliferation of SteamOS as well as smart TVs, we see a bright
future for the platform. In short, we love our Linux supporters and will
always endeavor to bring each of our titles to Linux, if at all possible.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Feral Interactive started putting out Linux conversions in 2014, with <em>XCOM:
Enemy Unknown</em>. Since then, the company's most popular Linux ports have
included <em>XCOM 2</em>, <em>Rise of the Tomb Raider</em>, <em>Life is
Strange</em> and <em>Deus Ex:
Mankind Divided</em>.
</p>

<p>
As a result of working with a number of different original developers, Feral
handles a wider range of game engines and uses a greater variety of tools
than most of the studios we've spoken to, porting titles originally developed
in Glacier Engine, Crystal Dynamics' Foundation Engine and Unreal Engine.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Feral Interactive" src="12523f7.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 7. A small, but growing number of AAA games are ported to Linux by
conversion specialists like Feral Interactive.</p>
</div>

<p>
Feral's PR manager Mary Musgrove says: "We saw Linux as an underserved audience, and
because we had experience in Unix-based porting, we thought it would be an
obvious extension to what we already do."
</p>

<p>
Linux gamers sometimes are frustrated that even games that have been ported
to macOS often don't make it to Linux. Although modern development tools and
game engines can make the job easier, there's still a lot of work involved.
</p>

<p>
The Feral team took us through the key factors involved in porting to Linux
and explained where those critical differences come in:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Compiler: "We compile Linux games with GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection,
which behaves differently to the Clang compiler that we use on macOS."
</li>

<li>
Drivers: "Linux uses a completely different set of drivers from macOS. In the
case of open-source drivers, Feral developers often contribute to fixes that
our games require."
</li>

<li>
Graphics APIs: "In the last couple years, the advent of Metal and Vulkan
means that our macOS and Linux games now use different graphics APIs. Prior
to this, they both used OpenGL, although each platform required separate
optimization processes."
</li>

<li>
Hardware and software testing: "When we release a game, we thoroughly test it
on a wide range of hardware and software configurations to determine what
that game can officially support. Not only is there little overlap between
macOS and Linux hardware and software, but there's naturally a lot more
variation in terms of what hardware and software Linux users have."
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Feral also has developed and released open-source tools to make life easier
not only for themselves but also for Linux game developers in general. A recent
example is GameMode (available now on GitHub), "an open-source tool that
allows games to request that a set of performance-improving optimizations be
temporarily applied to the host OS. Previously, some of our games required
users to manually swap the CPU governor using sudo-privileged commands, but
GameMode automates this, and ensures the CPU is restored to a more efficient
state when they've finished playing."
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
The State of the Market</h3>

<p>
One of the biggest shifts toward mainstream Linux gaming came in late 2012,
when <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en">Valve</a> launched its Steam beta client for Ubuntu, along with its hugely
successful zombie shooter, <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>.
</p>

<p>
Since then, the company has been a strong supporter of Linux hardware and
software development. Although Valve's SteamOS gaming distro received a
somewhat muted response, the company continues to support it, along with
other projects including SteamVR for Linux, a Steam Controller kernel driver
and a Linux version of the Source game engine.
</p>

<p>
A little more than 20% of all games on Steam—around 5,000 titles in
total—run on Linux, and it continues to be the biggest release platform for major
game publishers. 
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, retro-loving, DRM-free <a href="https://www.gog.com">GOG.com</a>—a subsidiary of <a href="https://en.cdprojektred.com">CD Projekt</a>,
developer of the Witcher games—operates a more curated digital storefront,
with a total of just less than 2,500 games available. Since launching Linux
support with 50 titles on August 19, 2014, 851 of the games on GOG.com—more
than 35%—now have native Linux installers. 
</p>

<p>
Indie gaming darling <a href="https://itch.io">itch.io</a> has supported Linux games since it first
launched on March 3, 2013, with the first downloadable Linux title, <em>Sophie
Houlden's Rose and Time</em>, coming to the platform later the same month.
</p>

<p>
itch.io creator Leaf Corcoran says that Linux games and open-source software
are personally important: 
</p>

<blockquote><p>
I switched to Linux many years ago. I use it as my
daily driver and to develop itch.io. I'm happy to see the reasons for going
back to Windows for gaming are shrinking every day. Linux as a platform was
supported the first day itch.io launched. We continue to prioritize it when
launching new products, like our desktop app and our upload/patching tools.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As a distribution platform, itch.io is home to many games that can be played
in a web browser. There are more than 38,000 of them right now—around 35% of
itch.io's total—all of which work on Linux browsers. There are also 15,000
downloadable Linux titles, adding up to another 13.8% of all itch.io games.
This makes it the biggest Linux distribution platform in terms of sheer
numbers, and the games on it range from artistic experiments and game jam
entries to better-known games, such as <em>Doki Doki Literature Club</em>,
<em>Night in the
Woods</em> and <em>Everything</em>.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
How Many People Play Games on Linux Anyway?</h3>

<p>
Lizard Cube's Omar Cornut says the number of Linux players of <em>The Dragon's
Trap</em> is "quite low, unfortunately. Last time I looked, Linux was about 1.5% of
our Windows sales. I think if we add up Linux and OS X sale, we just recouped
external cost there, so it's not too bad!" 
</p>

<p>
However, he feels that a simultaneous release may have bumped up dedicated
Linux sales figures. "We made a mistake where due to timing issues, we didn't
launch all platforms simultaneously, so that didn't help the Linux and Mac
sales I suppose."
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Cultist Simulator" src="12523f8.png"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 8. <em>Cultist Simulator</em> tells stories through the medium of a virtual
card game.</p>
</div>

<p>
Figures are similar across the board. Just 2% of <em>Cultist Simulator</em>'s current
player base uses Linux. For <em>West of Loathing</em>—on Steam, at
least—it's a
little more than 1%. A little more than 2% of <em>MidBoss</em>'s players are on Linux, while
Wube Software reports that between 1% and 2% of <em>Factorio</em> players are using
the open-source OS.
</p>

<p>
For <em>Night in the Woods</em>, Finji director Adam Saltsman says that Linux makes up
just 0.4% of the game's total users across all platforms, which includes
consoles as well as computers.
</p>

<p>
Although Portalarium's <em>Shroud of the Avatar</em> has both online and offline modes,
it's most widely played as an online multiplayer game, and Chris Spears says
its Linux players are particularly committed: "Right now only about 2% of our
player base plays on Linux, but they average more hours per player. We have
seen this growing slightly over time, and we have a number of players who play
on multiple platforms."
</p>

<p>
Linux users make up only a tiny percentage of these games' total players, but
most of the developers' figures are still a marked improvement on the 0.55%
Linux market share reported in Steam's April 2018 hardware and software
survey. Numbers vary, but when a company goes to the trouble of releasing a
mainstream game for the OS, they can expect some 2% of their customers to
play on Linux.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Ad Choices Symbol" src="12523f9.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 9. On indoe-friendly itch.io, Linux downloads make up around 12% of the total.</p>
</div>

<p>
The figures become even more optimistic on itch.io's indie-oriented
distribution platform, where Linux downloads account for roughly 12% of the
total, tied with macOS. itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran says that Linux users
generate more downloads per game on average than their Mac-using
counterparts too.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
What's Next?</h3>

<p>
If you're keen to start developing games for Linux, there's never been a
better time, with tools ranging from beginner-friendly text-game-maker Twine
to fully-fledged integrated development environments, such as Unity and Unreal
Engine. Both support a wealth of third-party assets and plugins to help you
craft anything from a point-and-click adventure game to a modern first-person
shooter.
</p>
<div class="caption">
<img alt="Unity game engine" src="12523f10.jpg"/>

<p class="caption">Figure 10. The Unity game engine is the development tool of choice for most of
the Linux game programmers I spoke with.</p>
</div>

<p>
Although margins are tight, many developers genuinely appreciate the
enthusiasm of their Linux-using players and are willing to support the OS if
it's at all financially viable, even if it doesn't turn a huge profit.
</p>

<p>
If Linux users want more games to play, it's important to add them to your
wishlists—this affects the visibility of pre-released games on
Steam—and to buy them. Specifically, buy them from your Linux system, as many
distribution platforms register what OS you're using at the time of purchase. 
</p>

<p>
Help developers out with bug reports and reasonable feature requests. And if
you enjoy a Linux title, leave a positive review for it. Reviews can have a
real impact on a game's visibility and rating on online stores, as well as
giving a warm glow to a developer who's gone to the effort of supporting
what's still a minority gaming OS.
