<h2 class="sigil_not_in_toc">What's New in Kernel Development By Zack Brown</h2>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Moving Compiler Dependency Checks to Kconfig</h3>

<p>
The Linux kernel config system, <strong>Kconfig</strong>, uses a macro language very similar
to the <strong>make</strong> build tool's macro language. There are a few
differences, however. And
of course, make is designed as a general-purpose build tool while Kconfig is
Linux-kernel-specific. But, why would the kernel developers create a whole new
macro language so closely resembling that of an existing general-purpose
tool?
</p>

<p>
One reason became clear recently when <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> asked developers to add
an entirely new system of dependency checks to the Kconfig language,
specifically testing the capabilities of the <strong>GCC</strong> compiler.
</p>

<p>
It's actually an important issue. The Linux kernel wants to support as many
versions of GCC as possible—so long as doing so would not require too much
insanity in the kernel code itself—but different versions of GCC support
different features. The GCC developers always are tweaking and adjusting, and
GCC releases also sometimes have bugs that need to be worked around. Some
Linux kernel features can only be built using one version of the compiler or
another. And, some features build better or faster if they can take advantage
of various GCC features that exist only in certain versions.
</p>

<p>
Up until this year, the kernel build system has had to check all those
compiler features by hand, using many hacky methods. The art of probing a
tool to find out if it supports a given feature dates back decades and is
filled with insanity. Imagine giving a command that you know will fail, but
giving it anyway because the specific manner of failure will tell you what
you need to know for a future command to work. Now imagine hundreds of hacks
like that in the Linux kernel build system.
</p>

<p>
Part of the problem with having those hacky checks in the build system is
that you find out about them only during the build—not during
configuration. But since some kernel features require certain GCC versions,
the proper place to learn about the GCC version is at config time. If the
user's compiler doesn't support a given feature, there's no reason to show
that feature in the config system. It should just silently not exist.
</p>

<p>
Linus requested that developers migrate those checks into the Kconfig system
and regularize them into the macro language itself. This way, kernel features
with particular GCC dependencies could identify those dependencies and then
show up or not show up at config time, according to whether those
dependencies had been met.
</p>

<p>
That's the reason simply using <code>make</code> wouldn't work. The config language had
to represent the results of all those ugly hacks in a friendly way that
developers could make use of.
</p>

<p>
The code to do this has been added to the kernel tree, and <strong>Masahiro
Yamada</strong>
recently posted some documentation to explain how to use it. The docs are
essentially fine, although the code will gradually grow and grow as new
versions of GCC require new hacky probes.
</p>

<p>
It's actually not so easy to know what should and should not go into the
config system. If we're probing for GCC versions, why not probe for hardware
peripherals as well? Why leave this for the kernel to do at runtime? It's
not necessarily clear. In fact, it's an open debate that ultimately
could swing either way. Dumping all this GCC-detection code into Kconfig may make
Kconfig better able to handle other such dumps that previously would have
seemed like too much. The only way we'll really know is to watch how the
kernel developers probe Linus to see what he'll accept and what would be
going too far.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Bug Hunting Inlined Code</h3>

<p>
The Linux kernel has various debugging tools. One is the kernel function
<strong>tracer</strong>, which traces function calls, looking for bad
memory allocations and
other problems.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Changbin Du</strong> from <strong>Intel</strong> recently posted
some code to increase the range of the
function tracer by increasing the number of function calls that were
actually compiled into the kernel. Not all function calls are ever actually
compiled—some are "inlined", a <strong>C</strong> feature that allows
the function code to
be copied to the location that calls it, thus letting it run faster. The
downside is that the compiled binary grows by the number of copies of that
function it has to store.
</p>

<p>
But, not all inlined functions are specifically intended by the developers.
The <strong>GNU C Compiler</strong> (GCC) also will use its own algorithms
to decide to inline
a wide array of functions. Whenever it does this in the Linux kernel, the
function tracer has nothing to trace.
</p>

<p>
Changbin's code still would allow functions to be inlined, but only if they
explicitly used the <code>inline</code> keyword of the C language. All
other inlining
done by GCC itself would be prevented. This would produce less efficient
code, so Changbin's code never would be used in production kernel builds.
But on the other hand, it would produce code that could be far more
thoroughly
examined by the function tracer, so Changbin's code would be quite useful
for
kernel developers.
</p>

<p>
As soon as he posted the patches, bug reports popped up all over the kernel
in functions that GCC had been silently inlining. As a result, absolutely
nobody had any objections to this particular patch.
</p>

<p>
There were, however, some odd false positives produced by the function
tracer, claiming that it had found bugs that didn't actually exist. This
gave
a few kernel developers a slight pause, and they briefly debated how to
eliminate those false positives, until they realized it didn't really
matter.
They reasoned that the false positives probably indicated a problem with
GCC,
so the GCC people would want to be able to see those false positives
rather than have them hidden away behind workarounds.
</p>

<p>
That particular question—what is a kernel issue versus a GCC
issue—is
potentially explosive. It didn't lead anywhere this time, but in the past,
it
has led to bitter warfare between the kernel people and the GCC people. One
such war was over GCC's failure to support <strong>Pentium</strong>
processors and led to a
group of developers forking GCC development into a competing project,
called
<strong>egcs</strong>. The fork was very successful, and it began to be
used in mainstream Linux
distributions instead of GCC. Ultimately, the conflict between the two
branches was resolved only after the egcs code was merged into the GCC main
branch, and future GCC development was handed over to the egcs team of
developers in 1999.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Support for a LoRaWAN Subsystem</h3>

<p>
Sometimes kernel developers find themselves competing with each other
to get
their version of a particular feature into the kernel. But sometimes
developers discover they've been working along very similar lines, and the
only reason they hadn't been working together was that they just didn't
know
each other existed.
</p>

<p>
Recently, <strong>Jian-Hong Pan</strong> asked if there was any interest in
a
<strong>LoRaWAN</strong> subsystem
he'd been working on. LoRaWAN is a commercial networking protocol
implementing a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) allowing relatively slow
communications between things, generally phone sensors and other internet
of
things devices. Jian-Hong posted a link to the work he'd done so far:
<a href="https://github.com/starnight/LoRa/tree/lorawan-ndo/LoRaWAN">https://github.com/starnight/LoRa/tree/lorawan-ndo/LoRaWAN</a>.
</p>

<p>
He specifically wanted to know "should we add the definitions into
corresponding kernel header files now, if LoRaWAN will be accepted as a
subsystem in Linux?" The reason he was asking was that each definition had
its own number. Adding them into the kernel would mean the numbers
associated
with any future LoRaWAN subsystem would stay the same during development.
</p>

<p>
However, <strong>Marcel Holtmann</strong> explained the process:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When you submit your LoRaWAN
subsystem to netdev for review, include a patch that adds these new address
family definitions. Just pick the next one available. There will be no
pre-allocation of numbers until your work has been accepted upstream.
Meaning, that the number might change if other address families get merged
before yours. So you have to keep updating. glibc will eventually follow
the
number assigned by the kernel.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Meanwhile, <strong>Andreas Färber</strong> said he'd been working on
supporting the same
protocol himself and gave a link to his own proof-of-concept repository:
<a href="https://github.com/afaerber/lora-modules">https://github.com/afaerber/lora-modules</a>.
</p>

<p>
On learning about Andreas' work, Jian-Hong's response was, "Wow! Great! I
get new friends :)"
</p>

<p>
That's where the public conversation ended. The two of them undoubtedly
have pooled their energies and will produce a new patch, better than either
of
them might have done separately.
</p>

<p>
It's interesting to me the way some projects
are more amenable to merging together than others. It seems to have less to
do with developer personalities, and more to do with how much is at stake
in
a given area of the kernel. A new load-balancing algorithm may improve the
user experience for some users and worsen it for others, depending on their
particular habits. How can two developers resolve their own questions about
which approach is better, given that it's not feasible to have lots of
different load balancers all in the kernel together? Wars have gone on for
years over such issues. On the other hand, supporting a particular protocol
or a particular peripheral device is much easier. For one thing, having
several competing drivers in the kernel is generally not a problem, at
least
in the short term, as long as they don't dig too deeply into core kernel
behaviors. Developers can test their ideas on a live audience and see what
really works better and what doesn't. When that sort of freedom disappears,
the
closer you get to real speed issues and real security issues.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Support for a GNSS and GPS Subsystem</h3>

<p>
Recently, there was a disagreement over whether a subsystem really
addressed
its core purpose or not. That's an unusual debate to have. Generally
developers know if they're writing support for one feature or
another.</p>

<p>
In this particular case, <strong>Johan Hovold</strong> posted patches to
add
a <strong>GNSS</strong> subsystem
(Global Navigation Satellite System), used by <strong>GPS</strong> devices.
His idea was that
commercial GPS devices might use any input/output ports and
protocols—serial, USB and whatnot—forcing user code to perform
difficult probes in
order to determine which hardware it was dealing with. Johan's code would
unify the user interface under a /dev/gnss0 file that would hide the
various
hardware differences.
</p>

<p>
But, <strong>Pavel Machek</strong> didn't like this at all. He said that
there wasn't any
actual GNSS-specific code in Johan's GNSS subsystem. There were a number of
GPS devices that wouldn't work with Johan's code. And, Pavel felt that at
best
Johan's patch was a general power management system for serial devices. He
felt it should not use names (like "GNSS") that then would be unavailable
for
a "real" GNSS subsystem that might be written in the future.
</p>

<p>
However, in kernel development, "good enough" tends to trump "good but not
implemented". Johan acknowledged that his code didn't support all GPS
devices, but he said that many were proprietary devices using proprietary
interfaces, and those companies could submit their own patches. Also, Johan
had included two GPS drivers in his patch, indicating that even though his
subsystem might not contain GNSS-specific code, it was still useful for its
intended purpose—regularizing the GPS device interface.
</p>

<p>
The debate went back and forth for a while. Pavel seemed to have the
ultimate
truth on his side—that Johan's code was at best misnamed, and at
worst,
incomplete and badly structured. Although Johan had real-world usefulness
on his
side, where something like his patch had been requested by other developers
for a long time and solved actual problems confronted by people today.
</p>

<p>
Finally <strong>Greg Kroah-Hartman</strong> put a stop to all
debate—at least for the
moment—by simply accepting the patch and feeding it up to
Linus
Torvalds
for inclusion in the main kernel source tree. He essentially said that
there
was no competing patch being offered by anyone, so Johan's patch would do
until anything better came along.
</p>

<p>
Pavel didn't want to give up so quickly, and he tried at least to negotiate
a
name change away from "GNSS", so that a "real" GNSS subsystem might still
come along without a conflict. But with his new-found official support,
Johan
said, "This is the real gnss subsystem. Get over it."
</p>

<p>
It's an odd situation. On the other hand, the Linux kernel generally avoids
trying
to stake out territory for infrastructure that doesn't yet exist. It may be
that Johan's non-GNSS GNSS subsystem will be all that's ever needed for GPS
device support. In which case, why assume it will ever be more complicated
than this? Famous last words.
