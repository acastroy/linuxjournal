<h1 class="title">VCs Are Investing Big into a New Cryptocurrency: Introducing
Handshake</h1>
<div class="caption">

<p class="caption"></p>
</div>
<p>
The entire landscape of how we authenticate domain names likely will see a
complete overhaul, all powered by blockchain technologies. Just released,
Handshake brings with it the much needed security and reliability on which
we rely. Backed by venture capitalists and industry-established blockchain
developers, Handshake has raised $10.2 million to replace the current
digital entities maintaining our current internet infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
The project and protocol has been led by Joseph Poon (creator of
Bitcoin's Lightning Network), Andrew Lee (CEO of Purse), Andrew Lee (founder
of
Private Internet Access or PIA) and Christopher Jeffrey (CTO of Purse). The
effort also is backed by 67 individuals with funding coming from A16z,
Founders Fund, Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners, Polychain Capital and
Draper Associates.
</p>
<p>
The Handshake project pledges to donate its initial
funding of $10.2 million to FOSS projects, university research
departments and more. The list of recipients includes projects and
foundations
such as the Apache Software Foundation, FreeBSD, Reproducible Builds, GNOME,
FSF, SFC, Outreachy, ArchLinux, systemd and many more.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
What Is Handshake?</h3>

<p>
Handshake aims to be a wholly democratic and decentralized certificate
authority and naming system. Handshake does not replace the Domain
Name System (DNS). It is, however, an alternative to today's certificate
authorities—that is, it uses a decentralized trust anchor to prove
domain
ownership. Although the primary goal of the project is to simplify and
secure top-level domain registration while also <em>making the root
zone uncensorable, permissionless and free of gatekeepers</em>.
</p>

<p>
A traditional root DNS supports the current infrastructure of the internet
and, therefore, facilitates online access. The root servers hosting the
internet publish root zone file contents, which are responsible for the
internet's DNS functionality. DNS associates information with domain
names and maps them to public-facing IP addresses.
</p>

<p>
The way Handshake differs from this is that it's all peer to peer. Every
peer is responsible for validating and managing the root zone (via the use
of "light clients"). All existing entries in the root zone file
will form the genesis block of the blockchain supporting it. The same
root zone will be distributed across the nodes forming the chain. The
implementation allows for any participant to help host this distributed
root zone and add to it.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">
How Does It Work?</h3>

<p>
Handshake makes use of a coin system for name registration (that is, the
Handshake coin or HNS). It is the mechanism by which participants are able
to transfer, register and update internet domain names. Currently,
Handshake has opened a faucet to distribute HNS coins to qualified FOSS
contributors. If you are one such contributor and you meet the
project's criteria, you can sign up <a href="https://handshake.org/signup">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once HNS coins have been distributed, the Handshake mainnet launches. A
"mainnet" forms the central part of a blockchain. In fact, it
<em>is</em> the blockchain in that it carries out the functionality of
transferring digital currency from senders to recipients. This is the point
where coin-holders can start auctioning, registering and transferring
top-level domains.
</p>

<p>
With enough support and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) cooperation,
Handshake eventually will migrate to a more global distribution. Project
governance and maintainability are and will continue to be community-driven.
</p>
