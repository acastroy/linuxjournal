Give new life to old phones and tablets with these tips!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c671f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you're like me (and you're a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> reader, so you may actually
be like me), you probably rotate through your cell phones and/or tablets
every couple years. These little devices are so convenient and have
been consistently dropping in price, while their power continues to go up,
so you may have a few older devices sitting in a drawer. Thank Moore's Law
for that&mdash;but what can you do with your old devices? There are a couple 
obvious things to do with old devices: some phone carriers allow you to
&ldquo;trade up&rdquo;, or you can hand them down to your kids or friends. However,
there are quite a few uses for old devices aside from just pawning them off
on your friends or disposing of them. This article is geared primarily
at Android devices. Some of you may have older Apple iOS devices (it's
okay if you do, I do too), and I'll drop hints on how to re-use those devices as
well. With that, let's get started!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c67460"></a>
Media Player</h2></div></div><p>
This may be an obvious choice, so let's lead with it. Re-using an old
device as a dedicated media player is easy and doesn't require much
work. Just load up the device with your media of choice, and rock out! If
you really want to get obsessive though, install the Plex Media Server
running on a computer at your home, get the Plex Media Client for
your mobile device (it's available for both Android and iOS) and turn
your old smartphone into a media-streaming machine!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c67568"></a>
Digital Picture Frame</h2></div></div><p>
This is another obvious choice, but surprisingly easy to forget about. Simply
upload any pictures you'd like to display, and then set the gallery/photo
program to display them in a looping slideshow.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c67670"></a>
Security Camera/Baby Monitor</h2></div></div><p>
Smartphones generally have the ability to record video. Why not utilize
that ability to have your own little wireless security camera? You
can use the app IP Webcam if you're on Android (or Presence for
iOS), and turn your old phone into an effective way to monitor your
home. Alternatively, if you've got a small child, set it up in his or her
room to act as a video-equipped baby monitor. I wish this would have
been possible when our daughter was little. It would have saved my wife
and I a lot of tiptoeing into the kid's room to check on her...without
waking her up, which was always a trick.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c67778"></a>
Kitchen Timer/Internet Recipe Lookup</h2></div></div><p>
When I saw someone do this, I thought, &ldquo;Why didn't I think of
that?&rdquo; It's
just that simple. Put an old phone or tablet on the counter, use its
timer while cooking recipes, and have its Web browser up and running to
display recipes while whipping up food in the kitchen. There's another
trick that a smart device can do for you in the kitchen too. You
can use its calculator to help do the math for doubling up ingredients
for recipes. Who cares if you accidentally get the old phone full of
frosting or flour? Just make sure it doesn't find its way into the
oven&mdash;lithium-ion batteries don't take well to baking at 350&deg;F for a half-hour.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c678d8"></a>
Dedicated VoIP/Skype Handset</h2></div></div><p>
If you're a heavy Skype or VoIP user, why not re-use your old smartphone
as a wireless handset for those services? Even an HTC Dream or iPhone
3GS has enough CPU to run VoIP applications, if it's not forced to do
anything else. Bonus points if you pair that with a Bluetooth headset
for double the wireless action.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c679e0"></a>
IRC/IM Terminal</h2></div></div><p>
If you're <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a VoIP user, and prefer to use old-school messaging
services like IRC, just drop a copy of Andchat on your Android phone
(or Colloquy for iOS), configure it up, and have fun chatting like it's
1998. Optionally, you can set up a crazy Irssi proxy and bouncer to keep
you connected 24 hours a day, seven days a week (see Resources for
a link to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> article on this).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c67bf0"></a>
Miniature Arcade System</h2></div></div><p>
This may be one of my favorite uses for an old smartphone or tablet&mdash;so much so, that I have one of these on my desk at work. There are a lot
of emulators available for Android for your favorite arcade or console
systems, although though you may have to scour the Google Play store to find
them. This also assumes you have a library of ROMs as well. It's 
possible to do this on iOS devices too, but you may have to jailbreak the device. When
you're all done, you wind up with a really cool little arcade system,
especially if you pair it with an iCade or iCade Jr.

E-Book Reader</h2></div></div><p>
Why buy a Kindle, if you have an old device in a drawer? There are
Kindle apps for both Android and iOS that are very functional. I actually
have a couple old iPod Touches around the house that do nothing
but this&mdash;I have one by the couch and another by my bedside. Since
the Kindle application syncs reading positions via the Amazon cloud,
it provides a seamless way for me just to grab a device and read for a
while. It may be a bit overkill, even lazy, but it keeps the old devices
out of the desk drawer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c67fb8"></a>
Internet Radio</h2></div></div><p>
Much like the media player option, you can dedicate a device to being
a Pandora, Spotify or Rdio streamer. If you've got a stereo receiver
in your house, you even could wire it in semi-permanently and never use
physical media again.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c680c0"></a>
Build Your Own Car DashCam</h2></div></div><p>
Dashboard-mounted cameras aren't only for people in Russia to post videos
to YouTube. They can be beneficial for lots of other reasons too. I wish
I had one to capture the antics of my daily commute. With an app called
Daily Roads Voyager and a suction-cup dash mount, any Android device
can become a dashcam. It'll loop the video so you don't have to worry
about memory management, and it will correlate the video with a position
on a GPS map. It could be handy in the event of an accident while driving.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c681c8"></a>
Build an Android-Powered Laptop</h2></div></div><p>
This tip really applies only if you've got a Motorola Android phone,
like a Droid RAZR or Atrix, but at one point, Motorola made a Lapdock,
which was a clamshell docking station for its handsets that included
a large battery built in to the base, along with a USB connection for
the built-in keyboard and touchpad, and a mini-HDMI connector for
video. These Lapdock units originally sold for $500 or so when they
were introduced, but now they can be found on eBay and Amazon.com for as
little as $50. Depending on your Motorola device, the Lapdock may
work out of the box, or you may have to modify the docking connector
slightly. (I had to flip the orientation of the HDMI connector to get it
to work with a Droid RAZR, for instance.) A bonus of having a Lapdock
on hand&mdash;if you have a Raspberry Pi, the Lapdock can be modified to
work with that as well. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Editor Kyle Rankin's got one of
these homemade creations and has said that it works surprisingly well.

Experiment with Alternate ROMs</h2></div></div><p>
Only the curious need apply here, but it's a fun place to be. Due to the
open-source nature of the Android operating system, lots of alternative
ROMs have been released for various devices. The most prolific of these
is the Cyanogenmod project. The Cyanogenmod folks have released ROMs for
just about any Android device released to date. The Cyanogenmod project
aims to release a basic, no-frills, yet stable Android product, unlike
some versions of Android that device makers ship. The Cyanogenmod team's
products also work on some of the oldest devices out there, like the
T-Mobile G1. If you're in the mood to coax new life out of an old Android
device, Cyanogenmod should be your first stop. If you're interested in
digging deeper into the guts of your device, the XDA-Developers forum is
a great place to find more esoteric ROMs and other information about your
device. Many members of that community port newer ROMs to older devices,
so be sure to look at the subforum that matches your hardware and see
if you can find something cool to try out.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c68640"></a>
Create a Super-Low-Power Server</h2></div></div><p>
Another fun little project that you can do with an older Android device
is to repurpose it to be a low-power server. It's possible to install
packages like Apache on Android if you know what you're doing, but
there's an easier way. There's a package on the Google Play store called
Servers Ultimate, and it enables all manner of servers, from httpd/Web,
to Samba/CIFS, even VNC and SSH. There are optional &ldquo;packs&rdquo; of servers
sold as add-ons to the main application, so you even can host your own
Git server on an old phone, if you chose to do so.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c687a0"></a>
Wireless Touchpad</h2></div></div><p>
Install the free Gmote application on your device and its companion
software on your computer, and you can turn your old phone or tablet into
a wireless touchpad for your desktop PC. If you pair it with a laptop,
you could use an old phone as a wireless presentation remote too!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c68900"></a>
Use Tasker to Automate Mundane Things</h2></div></div><p>
Tasker is an automation engine for Android devices. If you've ever
tried the IFTTT Internet service, Tasker is similar to that, without the
service, as it runs solely on your device. Tasker's built to run on your
primary device, either a handset or tablet, but it's got some value for
use on a secondary device. Imagine an alarm clock that would wake you up
with a random song from your favorite playlist, and then do text-to-speech
conversion on your incoming e-mail and read you your messages while you
were waking up. That's the kind of thing that's possible with Tasker.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b6f580.0x1c68a08"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I've shown you a few ideas of what's possible with old devices
you may have sitting in a drawer, maybe you'll think of a few ideas of
your own. Get those devices out and start putting them to use! These
little guys have as much processing power as full-fledged computers did
just a few years ago, so they're still able to get some real work (or
play) done. Feel free to experiment, and see what you can come up with!

Alternate ROMs for Old iOS Devices</b></p><p>
iOS devices can present their own challenges, but if you have one lying
around, you still can sideload an alternate ROM onto it&mdash;assuming it's
a supported model. Right now, Whited00r is the only option you've got,
and you have to be on either an old iPhone 2G, 3G or iPod Touch 1G or
2G. It tries to backport a lot of Apple's iOS 7 look and feel as well as
features to older hardware, and it succeeds...sort of. If you've got an
older iOS device just sitting in a drawer though, and you're curious,
it's worth a test drive.
