Getting healthy isn't much fun, but being a healthy
cyborg? Awesome.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb8358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Contrary to many people's beliefs, I'm not really a robot. Based on my
constant use of technology, however, it might be arguable that I'm a
cyborg&mdash;or at least pre-cyborg, if that's a thing. In this article, I'm going
to talk about the health-related technology I use as a Linux user. Some
of the things are still hard to do in a completely Linux environment,
but most work fine regardless of what's running under the keyboard. Why
focus on health? I'm glad you asked.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb8510"></a>
The Single Paragraph of Why</h2></div></div><p>
First off, summer is here for the Northern Hemisphere, and that usually
means we all want a sexy beach body&mdash;or at the very least we are willing
to crawl out of our insulated caves and get outside. For me, that's
especially true after the winter we've had here in the Midwest. On a
personal note, however, I recently found out I have some serious health
problems (kidney- and liver-related), so a healthy lifestyle is crucial. I
plan to get very, very old someday. If I'm going to be healthy, my best
chance of success is if I can do it with lots of gadgets. So, here we go!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb8618"></a>
Hardware: Weight for It...</h2></div></div><p>
Although there are plenty of aspects to a healthy lifestyle, I'm going to
focus on diet and exercise. Basically, what I put into my body, what I
do to make my body sweat and the precise measurement of gravitational
attraction between my body and the Earth. That gravitational attraction
(or &ldquo;weight&rdquo; for the mundane) certainly isn't the only measurement of
health, but whether we like to admit it or not, a healthy weight is
extremely beneficial.
</p><p>
I like data, but I hate recording it. That's one of the reasons I
purchased a Withings Wi-Fi-enabled digital scale. There currently are two
companies selling self-uploading scales that I know of: Withings and
Fitbit. I can't compare the actual brands, as I've used only the Withings,
but I can tell you firsthand that what seems frivolous and silly (namely
a Wi-Fi-enabled bathroom scale) is incredibly convenient and useful. Both
scales automatically upload and graph your weight over time. The Withings
scale supports multiple users, which it detects based on weight, and it has
been an investment I've never regretted. (Note: The Fitbit Aria scale
may support multiple users as well, but I don't have one, so I can't say.)
</p><p>
The only gotcha with the Withings scale is that when I purchased
mine years ago, there was no Linux software for configuring the Wi-Fi
settings. The settings are stored in the scale, even across battery
changes, so I've never had to worry about it since that initial
setup. (Yes, my Wi-Fi password is the same as it's always been. If you
visit my house, it likely still will be
&ldquo;bigredchicken&rdquo;&mdash;you're welcome.)
A quick Google search tells me there is now a native Linux setup program
for the Withings scale, which makes me even more happy to recommend it! The graphing is all done on-line with a free account (see Figures
1 and 2), but for the brave and adventurous, there is an API to connect
to the Withings site. If you're a fan of keeping your own data, it's
possible, albeit complicated, to arrange such a thing.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11699f1.large.jpg"><img src="11699f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Stop looking at my oddly-tanned feet! The scale underneath is 
the focus of the article. It tracks weight, BMI and fat percentage.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11699f2.large.jpg"><img src="11699f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. It's easy to tell on the graph when I started dieting. Go, go, go!
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb8c48"></a>
Hardware: Hut! 2, 3, 4...</h2></div></div><p>
The other main bit of hardware I use is a pedometer. Wearing a pedometer
won't make you skinny, but knowing exactly how much moving around you
do in a day is invaluable. I've found that days I thought I was pretty
good about moving around the house were actually pathetically low in
step count. And then days I hadn't considered particularly active have
tracked miles and miles of mindless walking I hadn't even realized
I'd done. The point is, a reliable pedometer offers incredibly useful
insight on your daily activity. But, who wants to keep track of all that
data? Again, I want the data, but I don't want to write it down. Enter:
Fitbit and the like.
</p><p>
I've had a half-dozen or so Fitbit pedometers during the past few
years. It's not necessarily the most affordable, or even most accurate
pedometer, but it's very popular. The on-line component alone (see 
the software section later in this article) might make it worth the expense. Thankfully,
I have a dear friend, Michelle Klishis, who actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> like to
enter data. She has done a very extensive test of pedometers, and if
there's anyone whose data I trust, it's Michelle's. If you don't have
a pedometer, I urge you to read her extensive review of the various
options: <a href="http://klishis.com/notreally/archives/11476" target="_self">klishis.com/notreally/archives/11476</a> (see Figure 3 for
one of many graphs).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11699f3.large.jpg"><img src="11699f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Deviation from average steps per hourly measurements? Yes. If
you want pedometer data, check out Michelle's extensive reviews.
</p></div></div><p>
Long story short, I currently have a Fitbit One. It slips in that
useless little pocket in my jeans (what is that pocket for anyway?)
and requires only weekly charging. The biggest danger with using a
Fitbit is that it's easy to forget it's in your pocket. They don't do
well in washing machines. The folks at company, however, do amazing customer
service. I lost a Fitbit Ultra tracker in the park, and they sent me
a free replacement, even though it was completely my fault. Really, it's a great company. BUT.
</p><p>
Up until the release of the Fitbit One (the newest pedometer at the time of
this writing), the only way to sync the data was to use a USB dock that
worked only with Windows and OS X. Feature-wise, the Fitbit is amazing as
it tracks steps, calories, miles and even altitude. On the Linux front,
however, it's not all that great. I'm happy to say, with the newer
tracking devices, syncing is done over Bluetooth to an Android (or iOS)
device. Windows or OS X are no longer required! I shamefully used to run
an old install of Windows XP in my office for the sole purpose of syncing
my Fitbit. Now, that's not an issue anymore. Plus, with phone-syncing,
the data is transmitted whether or not you're at home near your computer.
I love my Fitbit, I really do.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb9118"></a>
Hardware: Alternatives</h2></div></div><p>
I'm telling you specifically what I use because I know it works well, and
it fits my particular lifestyle. Please don't take that as an endorsement of
one product over another. Check out Michelle's pedometer information. Read
reviews of alternate digital scales. Heck, go check them out at the
store and see which one you like better!
</p><p>
In fact, newer cell phones are getting to the point that they can be
remarkably accurate pedometers on their own. One of the pedometer apps
available in the Google Play store might suit your needs just fine. The
point is to count your steps and keep track of your weight&mdash;not to get
caught up in brand preference or feature creep. That said, we're geeks,
and digital bells and whistles tend to be attractive!
</p><p>
Also, although I don't have one, I really like the concept of the Withings
blood pressure monitor. It syncs up over Bluetooth and records blood
pressure measurements and dates automatically. Yes, it's on my wish
list. For now, I use an Omron blood pressure monitor and enter the data
into the Withings site manually&mdash;like a barbarian.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb92d0"></a>
Software</h2></div></div><p>
The software is really where the magic happens with connected-health. It's
great to have the Withings site track your weight and the Fitbit site
track your steps, but without data integration, it's not a whole lot
better than pencil and paper (or more realistically, a spreadsheet).
Thankfully, most of the popular health-related Web sites allow for 
third-party integration. They don't all share everything with each other,
but it seems like more and more sites are offering integration. It's
pretty awesome. The following are some of the sites and apps I use
regularly.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
MyFitnessPal:</b></span>
</p><p>
This is the app/Web site I use the most. It has a social aspect for
connecting with friends and getting encouragement, but for me, the best
feature is the integration with Fitbit. MyFitnessPal (MFP for short)
has an incredible food database for tracking what you eat during
the day. If you happen to go over your calories for the day, its
integration with Fitbit means you can go for a long walk and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>earn</em></span>
more calories. Basically, after a minimal expected number of steps,
MFP will give you more calories to consume based on how far you've
walked. Because it's all synced and shared automatically, you just need
to check the MFP app periodically on your phone or Web site and see how
many calories you have left to consume. If you know you're going to have
a huge dessert after dinner, you can take a really long walk early in the
day and &ldquo;stock up&rdquo; on calories! It's truly amazing, and it's a healthy way to
make sure you don't overeat. MFP also allows you to enter other exercise
activities, along with the time you performed them, and it will grant
you the appropriate earned-back calories for those activities. Since
you enter a time, it makes sure not to &ldquo;double dip&rdquo; by also giving you
calories for Fitbit activity during that time frame. So if you take a 
two-hour bike ride, you can tell MFP about it and earn some serious calories,
even though a pedometer doesn't do a great job at tracking cycling. I
love MyFitnessPal. Oh, and weight? Yeah, MFP syncs with Withings to
keep track of your weight loss automatically as well. It's truly an
amazing site, and it's completely free: <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com" target="_self">www.myfitnesspal.com</a>.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
RunKeeper:</b></span>
</p><p>
Due to my recent kidney problems, I'm not able to do any strenuous
exercise. That said, I can walk. RunKeeper is an incredible GPS-enabled
app for tracking running, walking, biking and so on. It will track your
progress, pace and any number of activity-related data items. Much
like the Fitbit, RunKeeper will integrate with MyFitnessPal. I haven't
been able to try the integration yet, but if you do, be sure to check
for conflicts. It would be a shame to &ldquo;double dip&rdquo; and get both Fitbit
and RunKeeper calorie credit. If I'm able to start running again in the
future, this will be something I'll have to watch closely to see how
MFP handles such things. When it comes to tracking exercise, however,
it's hard to beat RunKeeper. There's a free and paid version in the
Google Play Store, along with a robust free Web site.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Withings Health:</b></span>
</p><p>
I normally log in to MyFitnessPal only on a daily basis. I do this to enter
food I eat and also to check on my weight loss progress. Unfortunately,
at the time of this writing, MFP doesn't have a great way to track
blood pressure. Remember earlier I mentioned how much I want the
Withings blood pressure monitor? Well, until that day comes, I enter
the information manually into the Withings site. It does a great job
of creating graphs, and since blood pressure is such a critical issue
for me (kidney problems), that graph is invaluable (Figure 4).
The weight-loss chart is nice too, but honestly, I really don't look
at it much. MFP shows current weight lost when you log in to the site,
so that's what I tend to look at.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11699f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Green is good. My blood pressure has been pretty stable,
and if anything, is getting a bit low. Soon I'll need to quit taking my
blood pressure medicine! Woot!
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Fitbit Site:</b></span>
</p><p>
I love the Fitbit, I really do, but I don't very often log in to the
Web site. This is unfortunate, because it has a great social feature
that shows you and your groups and friends in comparison. If you're the
competitive sort, it's easy to see which of your friends is
&ldquo;beating&rdquo;
you and up the pace in order to win. I'm not particularly competitive,
so there's no motivation for me there, but it's nice to keep an eye on
your friends and send encouragement if they seem to be stagnant. Fitbit
does offer a premium membership that offers some features in addition
to the free stuff, but I haven't ever been tempted to upgrade, because
any features I want come with the free account. (I don't feel bad about
this, because like I said, I've purchased at least a half-dozen Fitbit
trackers during the past few years for myself and family members.) If you're
not into tracking food intake or weight, however, the Fitbit site would
make a nice entry point for tracking stuff. I think it has the nicest
social/friend system, but since I want integration with all my devices,
it's not the site I default to. Check it out at <a href="http://www.fitbit.com" target="_self">www.fitbit.com</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb9c70"></a>
Oh the Places We'll Go</h2></div></div><p>
Why did I share all that information on the health stuff I do? One, I
want to share the incredible ways technology can help in living a healthy
lifestyle. Two, I'd love some accountability. Hit me up on MyFitnessPal
or the Fitbit site. Perhaps we can start a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> group on the
Fitbit site for anyone interested in such a thing. The unfortunate fact
is that many of us have very sedentary jobs, and we tend to eat poorly. At
least, that has been the case for me. I've been forced to take a hard
look at my health, and I figure as geeks, we might all benefit!
</p><p>
I'm going to start a Web-based &ldquo;Lifestyle&rdquo; column on the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> Web site. I hope to update everyone on new gadgets, features,
accomplishments, ideas and perhaps even geeky recipes for healthy
eating. If you're interested in taking this adventure with me, be sure
to watch <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a> for my future posts. Like I said earlier, I want
to live to get really, really old someday, and if I get to be part
cyborg too? Bonus!
