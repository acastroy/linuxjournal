CloudGenix's Software-Defined Enterprise WANs</h2></div></div><p>
The fledgling company CloudGenix recently emerged from &ldquo;stealth
mode&rdquo;
to reveal Software-Defined Enterprise WAN (SDEwan), a new category of
solutions for wide area networking (WAN) and remote office infrastructure
for the hybrid cloud and mobile era. SDEwan virtualizes enterprise
networks and securely brings together users and high-performance cloud
and data-center applications while radically reducing remote office
infrastructure requirements. CloudGenix says that its raison d'&ecirc;tre is
based on the fact that organizations are seeking to manage the complexity that
has arisen with the rapid adoption of cloud applications and services,
as well as hybrid networks within the enterprise. Enterprises need
solutions that not only simplify application access, but also provide
innovative ways of delivering network services to distributed enterprise
IT assets and infrastructure, adds the company.

Jerome Schaufeld's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Commercializing Innovation</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Commercializing technology is not easy. There are many complicated decisions to
make. Which ideas do you pursue? Whom do you hire? Where do you manufacture?
Where do you get the capital? Help in answering these and myriad others can be
found in the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Commercializing Innovation: Turning
Technology Breakthroughs
into Products</em></span> by Jerome Schaufeld. In the book, Schaufeld&mdash;a successful
technology entrepreneur and professor of entrepreneurship&mdash;offers a
step-by-step commercialization process that begins with assessing technology
from a variety of sources and ends with taking viable products into the market.
Schaufeld's systematic approach, complemented by numerous case studies and
models, combines both the theoretical and practical aspects of bringing
products to market.

Conrad Barski and Chris Wilmer's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bitcoin for the Befuddled</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>

&ldquo;must
be into Bitcoin&rdquo;, you know it's one of our tribe. In that geek pad, you
also will be likely to encounter Conrad Barski and Chris Wilmer's book

Optek Music Systems, Inc.'s SDK for the Fretlight Guitar</h2></div></div><p>
The Fretlight Guitar from Optek Music Systems, Inc., is similar to other
high-quality guitars you'll find at a music store, only with one important
difference. Each is equipped with built-in LED lights that indicate the
fingering positions for chords, scales, songs, riffs and even tablature right
under one's fingertips. What's more, the instrument can be connected to a
computer for an enhanced experience. The news about the Fretlight that will
truly set the geek heart aflutter, however, is the new software development
kit, which enables the creation of new, third-party desktop applications that
enhance the musical experience. With the new SDK, Fretlight is opening up its
interface code so that developers working in C and C++ can write software
applications, royalty free, for Linux, Mac or Windows. Optek opines that this
new development will lead to a wide range of new consumer applications. With
the addition of the Linux Community, the chances are certainly improved.

VectorWerks' Vector Cupholder</h2></div></div><p>
Think of the new Vector Cupholder from VectorWerks as a low-cost insurance plan
for your device collection. This new product neatly solves the problem of where
to put a beverage safely when most of your workspace is occupied by your
computing equipment, papers and books. The Vector Cupholder solves this dilemma
by taking the beverage off the workspace altogether. The Vector Cupholder
securely grips table edges as thick as 1.5" (3.8cm) and holds a wide
assortment of containers&mdash;from a huge, liter-sized trenti to a small airplane
cup; from Thermos bottles to soda cans; from water bottles to mugs up to 3"
(8cm) in diameter. By moving beverages off the table, the Vector
Cupholder also delivers the added benefit of freeing up &ldquo;real
estate&rdquo;
on cramped work surfaces like coffeehouse tables and airplane trays. The
investment in the Vector Cupholder is certainly less than the cost and hassle
of getting cappuccino out from under a keyboard.
