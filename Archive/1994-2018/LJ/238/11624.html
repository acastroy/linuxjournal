PiixL's Jetpack</h2></div></div><p>
The Jetpack, says its maker PiixL, is an open gaming hardware platform
designed for gamers who value both performance and interior design. With
Jetpack, raw, unprecedented&mdash;and hackable&mdash;gaming power meets
living-room entertainment with a beautiful design. After releasing its EdgeCenter
product, PiixL has become an expert at designing TV-centric PC hardware and is
now set to break new ground with this latest release. With more than 500 watts of
thermal capacity available to house the fastest components, Jetpack promises
to be the most powerful machine offered in such a compact package, asserts
PiixL. Designed around PiixL's leading-edge cooling architecture, Jetpack
uses a new generation of centrifugal fans to stay ultra-quiet at all times
while being able to host factory overclocked Core i7 processors, up to one
Terabyte of SSD storage, and the latest graphics cards from NVIDIA, including
Titan and GTX780s. Jetpack is optimized to complement Linux and Windows, with
a special focus on SteamOS, which combines the rock-solid architecture of
Linux with a gaming experience built for the big screen.

Linutop PC</h2></div></div><p>
Packing additional punch into a more petite package is the new Intel
Atom-based Linutop 5 miniature, energy-efficient PC. Linutop 5 is a
ready-to-use small PC, designed to reduce maintenance costs. Compact and
powerful with a 1.6GHz fanless Intel ATOM processor, Linutop 5 is designed
for applications, such as no-maintenance professional use, public Internet
access, office applications and digital signage. The 4GB of internal Flash
memory replaces the hard drive, and energy consumption has dropped to a mere
14 Watts, the same as a compact fluorescent light bulb. A new security feature
can lock the Linutop Operating System and protect the Flash memory from
wearing out by limiting write cycles. Once set up, the Linutop software is
protected. In lock mode, Linutop can recover its state at each startup,
minimizing maintenance costs. Linutop 5 is powered by the new Linutop OS based
on the latest long-term service Ubuntu version 12.04.

The Hello World Program</h2></div></div><p>
Learning about computer science and programming tends to be dry and not all
that accessible to kids. In an effort to make Linux and computer programming
more accessible for young people&mdash;not to mention really fun&mdash;a pair of
LA-based brothers have developed The Hello World Program, a kid-friendly
educational video puppet show that covers tech topics as diverse as Python,
Linux, Web design, video editing, 3-D modeling and animation, graphic design
and, of course, puppet making! Hello World is the creative effort of brothers
Jared and JR Nielsen who grew up in a rural area and made their own fun by
staging puppet shows, making their own toys and shooting short stop-motion
videos. &ldquo;We don't want a boring future, and we think the best way to
avoid that is by encouraging and educating the young and old to actively
produce their own media&rdquo;, says Jared Nielsen. At the time of this writing, the
Nielsen bothers are pitching Hello World on Kickstarter in order to leapfrog
it to the next level. &ldquo;We will definitely be continuing with the project
whether or not we reach our funding goal&rdquo;, commented JR Nielsen.
&ldquo;Our
time line and distribution may change as a result&rdquo;, he added, &ldquo;but we
are still set to produce the same content regardless of the Kickstarter
outcome.&rdquo; A boring future has indeed been preempted.

Undo Software's UndoDB</h2></div></div><p>
As devices and systems become more capable, the software becomes ever more
important and complex. As such, software developers bear an ever-growing
burden in terms of both quality and time to market. An updated&mdash;and
groovy&mdash;solution to these issues is version 4.0 of Undo Software's
UndoDB, a reversible debugger for Linux. UndoDB allows Linux software
developers to record their program's execution and then &ldquo;wind the
tape&rdquo; back
and forth in real time to get a clear picture of their program's execution,
significantly reducing the cost of bugs to software vendors. The most notable
new features in the new version 4.0 are support for ARM processors and Android
Native. Undo also notes that Linux developers have an alternative way to
utilize its solution: ARM recently integrated UndoDB into its flagship
software development studio, ARM DS-5 Professional Edition.

Axios Systems' assyst</h2></div></div><p>
Because this latest update of the assyst IT Service Management (ITSM) solution
makes it more akin to social media, the folks at Axios Systems believe that
it is
now destined to revolutionize the ITSM industry. assyst is a purpose-built
solution, designed to transform IT departments from technology-focused cost
centers into profitable business-focused customer service teams. Axios says
that assyst enables faster, less costly delivery and support of IT services,
allowing its clients to offer unparalleled multichannel support. This latest
release of assyst now offers guided help, enhanced reporting, enhancements to
the assystNET self-service portal and, most notably, IT Resource Performance
Management (IT RPM). IT RPM promotes collaboration and innovation within IT,
helping to establish IT as a business driver while reducing incoming calls to
the service desk. It also allows a business to leverage staff as a valuable
asset through rapid capture and transfer of knowledge as an integrated part of
the service management processes through the aforementioned social-media tools,
namely crowdsourcing, leaderboards and social profiles.

University of Applied Science Rapperswil's Muen Separation Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
As initiatives like the new Muen Separation Kernel mature, open source is
destined to play an ever greater role in the development of safe and secure
systems. To this end, the Institute for Internet Technologies &amp; Applications at
the University of Applied Science Rapperswil (Switzerland), together with
corporate partner AdaCore, announced a preview release of the Muen Kernel,
which enforces a strict and robust isolation of components. The isolation
shields security-critical functions from vulnerable software running on the
same physical system. To achieve the necessary level of trustworthiness, the
Muen team used the SPARK language and toolset to prove the absence of
runtime errors formally. The Muen developers used SPARK with a zero-footprint runtime,
a mode where no runtime environment, and only a minimum of supporting code, is
required. The name &ldquo;Muen&rdquo; is a Japanese term that means
&ldquo;unrelated&rdquo; or &ldquo;without relation&rdquo;, reflecting the main
objective for a separation kernel: ensuring the isolation between components.

Rami Rosen's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel Networking</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Because Linux-kernel networking is a complex topic, you don't want to be
bothered with extraneous miscellanea. This is the approach you'll find in Rami
Rosen's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel Networking: Implementation and
Theory</em></span>. Publisher Apress
says that readers will not be overloaded with cumbersome line-by-line code
walk-throughs not directly related to the topic at hand. Readers will find
exactly what they need, with in-depth explanations in each chapter and a quick
reference at the end of each chapter. Apress also claims that the title is
the only up-to-date reference guide to understanding how networking is
implemented in the latest version of the Linux kernel. In years to come, the
book is sure to be indispensable, because so many devices now use Linux or
operating systems based on Linux, and because Linux is so prevalent in the
data center, for example, due to Xen.

Eric Redmond's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Google Glass</em></span> ( Pragmatic Bookshelf)</h2></div></div><p>
If the government frantically regulates a widget before it's even out, you
know you gotta' get your hands on one. Today's widget in question is Google
Glass, a programmable, wearable Android-powered computer with an optical
head-mounted display. The new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming Google Glass: The Mirror
API</em></span> by Eric Redmond exists to kick-start users' Glassware development. Core
topics include exploring interfacing with Glass, developing a Glass
application via the Mirror API, tracking a Glass's geolocation, creating rich
interactions by responding to user inputs and capturing or serving up user
images and videos. This is the book to read for a shortcut to this brave new
world. Now, says publisher Pragmatic Bookshelf, is the best time to be an early
adopter of a technology that quickly will become more advanced, nuanced and
ubiquitous.
