Spiders are really cool. Granted, they're terrifying, but they're still
really cool. They keep the pest population down, they create super heroes,
and they socialize with little girls eating curds and whey, but most
impressively, they make webs. 
Their
ability to develop such intricate and useful constructions with nothing
more than spinnerets and a little ingenuity is impressive. Also impressive
is the ability for programmers to develop applications for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span> Web, the
World Wide Web, and make them accessible instantly to anyone on the planet.
Applications usually take more than one evening to build, but with this
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, we hope to make your Web-weaving a little more
efficient, and your Web a little more awesome.
</p><p>
We start the Web Development issue with Reuven M. Lerner's column about
split testing. When it comes to commercial Web sites, a high &ldquo;conversion
rate&rdquo; is the ultimate goal for a company, and it's the job of the Web
developer to create a site that accomplishes that goal. Reuven shows how
to do just that with Ruby, but the principles extend to any platform.
Next, Dave Taylor finishes his series on
scripting with ImageMagick with a description of how to put frames around images, again from inside a
script without the need for user interaction.
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin gives a great lesson on hosting DNS on your own network. 
With Kyle's article, you'll learn not only how to host your own DNS to help with uptime,
but also how to protect your privacy.
My column goes in the opposite direction, as I expose my entire
backyard to the Internet. Specifically, I revisit BirdCam. I've gotten lots
of feedback and questions about my backyard setup, so in this article, I
discuss some of the changes I've made, including adding motion detection.
</p><p>
For the past few years, Ruby has been one of the most popular Web
development platforms available. I'm not a developer myself, but it's
apparently very straightforward for developers. As a sysadmin, I can tell
you it's not as easy to manage the underlying hosting system. Fabrizio
Soppelsa provides some DevOps insight and describes managing a Ruby system to
host those applications. If you need to host Ruby applications, but have
struggled to manage the environment, you'll love Fabrizio's article.
</p><p>
Nitish Tiwari follows with a great article on security in Web applications.
With the fast-paced world of Web development, it's easy to overlook a
security hole. With Nitish's recommendations, you can avoid some of the more common
exploits. Rather than plugging holes after the fact, it's
better for everyone if the development is done with security in mind from
the beginning.

If you're developing a Web site that likely will get lots of traffic, you
might be interested in using a NoSQL database instead of the traditional
relational-style system. Unfortunately, such a system isn't as common, and
many folks aren't sure where to begin. This month, Mihalis Tsoukalos
explains
how to use Django and MongoDB to create a blog.
</p><p>
&ldquo;The Cloud&rdquo; is quite clearly here to stay. It's also evolving in such a way
that the concept of &ldquo;servers&rdquo; is becoming less and less important. We're all
familiar with Software as a Service (SaaS), but going even further down
that rabbit hole is Platform as a Service (PaaS). Mitesh Soni explores
the benefits of using PaaS and describes how to leverage the concept into
your Web development needs. Gone are the days when companies need to manage
their own Java platforms. With PaaS in the cloud, Web development platforms
are just one more commodity you can buy.
</p><p>
We end this issue with a guest post from Susan Sons, who responded to Doc
Searls'
December 2013 EOF column on women and Linux. I urge you to read her
article, and hopefully it furthers
the conversation even more. We've put together a great issue for you this
month, and whether or not you're a Web developer, you should find plenty of
helpful information between the digital covers.
