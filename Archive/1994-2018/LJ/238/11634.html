BirdCam is back&mdash;now with HD video and archives.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d2580.0x25ca358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the October 2013 issue, I described the hardware and software I used to create
my &ldquo;BirdTopia Monitoring Station&rdquo;, more commonly called BirdCam. If
you've been visiting BirdCam recently, which a surprising number of
folks have been doing, you'll notice quite a few changes (Figure 1).
In this article, I describe the upgrades, the changes and some
of the challenges along the way. If you like fun projects like these
involving Linux, please read on and join in my birdy obsession!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11634f1.large.jpg"><img src="11634f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. BirdCam has changed a lot. Here, the biggest changes
are highlighted. Also, <span  class="emphasis"><em>look at all those birds!</em></span>
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d2580.0x25ca778"></a>
Slicing and Dicing</h2></div></div><p>
One of the first changes I wanted to make to BirdCam was to zoom in a
bit on the feeders. Yes, the enormous photo provided by the Galaxy S2
phone mounted in the window is nice, but for displaying on a computer
screen (or HDTV, as I'll talk about later), a 1920x1080-size snapshot
is really ideal. Unfortunately, when I crop the photo, it leaves out
the birdbath. Because I spent the money on a heated birdbath this winter,
I didn't want to miss out on any candid water shots. You can see in
Figure 2 how I planned to zoom in on the bird feeders and then relocate
the birdbath onto what was left of the photo. Although it took a bit of
trial and error, the code for doing this was remarkably easy. I used the
<tt  >convert</tt> program from the ImageMagick suite. It might be possible to
include the crop and relocate into a single command, but I just created a
temp file and then overlayed that temp file later on:


<pre     class="programlisting">
convert /dev/shm/original.jpg -crop 640x360+1800+1425 \
        /dev/shm/birdbath.jpg
convert /dev/shm/original.jpg -crop 1920x1080+220+130 \
        /dev/shm/birdbath.jpg -gravity southeast -composite \
        /dev/shm/final.jpg
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11634f2.large.jpg"><img src="11634f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. My old cell phone takes really high-resolution photos. I was
able to clip out the birdbath and overlay it nicely to get a closeup
of the feeders.
</p></div></div><p>
In the code snippet above, I crop out the small birdbath photo from
the original camera photo and save it as birdbath.jpg. Then, with
another <tt  >convert</tt> command, I crop the original photo to that 1080p size
I mentioned earlier and overlay the birdbath onto the photo with the
<tt  >-composite</tt> flag. In this little example, I use the
<tt  >-gravity</tt> flag
to put the birdbath in the corner. You can be more precise with the
<tt  >-geometry</tt> flag, which you'll see in my final script
(see Resources).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d2580.0x25cacf8"></a>
Time and Temp</h2></div></div><p>
The original BirdCam article showed how to add a timestamp to the top
of the photo, but I didn't mention how I got the temperature. I've
since added sunrise and sunset information to the annotation, and made
it a little more readable. (Figure 1 shows the annotation in the upper-left corner.)
</p><p>
Although the method for overlaying the information isn't much different (you
can check it out in the final script&mdash;see Resources for the link), getting the temperature and
sunrise/sunset information was challenging. To get the current temperature, I
use a little command-line program called weather-util, available in most
distro repositories. The program actually gives much more information
than is required, so to extract just the temperature, you need to do a
little grep-fu:


<pre     class="programlisting">
weather-util -i KPLN | grep Temperature | awk '{print $2}'
</pre>
</p><p>
This requires a bit of explanation. You need to figure out what
your four-letter weather ID is. The best place to find that is at
<a href="http://weather.noaa.gov" target="_self">weather.noaa.gov</a>. Find the closest location to you, and then look
in the URL at the top for the four-letter code (usually an airport). For
example, the Pellston Regional Airport is my closest, so my ID is KPLN.
If you're thinking
it would be better to get the actual temperature from my backyard, I agree. In fact, I'll be working on setting up my own weather station
in the months to come for that very reason.
</p><p>
The rest of the code does two things. Grepping for
&ldquo;Temperature&rdquo; returns
the line of the weather-util results containing the temperature, and
then the awk command extracts just the Fahrenheit temperature from that
line. I set up a cron job to save the temperature into a text file
every few minutes, and I use that file to annotate the BirdCam
photo. The sunrise/sunset information is similar, but for that, I use
the Yahoo weather information. You'll need your WOEID information,
which again is available in the URL when you go to <a href="http://weather.yahoo.com" target="_self">weather.yahoo.com</a>
and enter your location information. For example, my weather URL is
<a href="http://weather.yahoo.com/united-states/michigan/indian-river-2426936" target="_self">weather.yahoo.com/united-states/michigan/indian-river-2426936</a>,
so my WOEID is 2426936. The rest is fairly easy using more grep-fu. Here's
the code for sunrise:


<pre     class="programlisting">
echo `l=2426936;curl -s http://weather.yahooapis.com/
&#8618;forecastrss?w=$l|grep astronomy| awk -F\" '{print $2}'`
</pre>
</p><p>
And the code for sunset:


<pre     class="programlisting">
echo `l=2426936;curl -s http://weather.yahooapis.com/
&#8618;forecastrss?w=$l|grep astronomy| awk -F\" '{print $4}'`
</pre>
</p><p>
Much like the temperature, I have a cron job that stores these values into
a text file that gets used during the annotation of the final BirdCam
graphic. Once I get a local weather station from which I can pull
information,
I might add wind speed and such. For now, I think it's a useful
bit of information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d2580.0x25cb380"></a>
The WindowCam</h2></div></div><p>
If you've been following my blog or my Twitter feed, you may have seen
a few different iterations of WindowCam. I tried weatherproofing a USB
Webcam (Figure 3), which worked until the wind packed snow into the
&ldquo;hood&rdquo; I
created with a Dixie cup. For a long time, I leaned an old iPhone against
the window and just extracted a photo to embed into the final BirdCam
photo. The iPhone's resolution was only 640x480, so it was fairly simple
to embed that image (downloaded directly from the iPhone) using
<tt  >convert</tt>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11634f3.large.jpg"><img src="11634f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. My Dixie-cup weatherproofing did an okay job, until the snow
flew. Now it's inside looking through the window.
</p></div></div><p>
But of course, I wanted more. My current window camera is a Logitech C-920
USB Webcam connected to a computer running Linux. At first I connected
it to a Raspberry Pi, but the RPi couldn't do more than five frames per
second. I wanted 15 frames per second, full HD, so I'm using a full-blown
computer. See, not only do I want to embed the window camera into
BirdCam, but I also want to have an archive video of the birds that
visit my feeder every day.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d2580.0x25cb7a0"></a>
The Magic of Motion</h2></div></div><p>
Much of the feedback I got about my original BirdCam article included
&ldquo;why didn't you use motion?&rdquo; Quite simply, I didn't have a computer nearby
I could attach to a camera. Now I do. Like I mentioned earlier, I started
with a Raspberry Pi. If you have simple needs, or a low-resolution camera,
the RPi might be plenty of horsepower. Since the procedures are the same
regardless of what computer you're using, just pick whatever makes sense
for you.
</p><p>
Motion is a frustratingly powerful program. By that, I mean it will do so
many things, it's often difficult to know where to begin. Thankfully,
the default configuration file is commented really well, and very few
tweaks are required to get things going. For my WindowCam, I 
have motion do three things:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Save a snapshot every second. This is for BirdCam, so that it can
embed a thumbnail of WindowCam in the corner. (See Figure 1, with the
huge Mourning Dove in the corner.)
</p></li><li><p>
When motion is detected, save full-resolution images, 15 frames every
second. Note, this is a lot of photos, especially with a busy WindowCam. I
easily get 100,000 photos or more a day.
</p></li><li><p>
Record videos of motion detected. I actually don't do this anymore,
because it's hard to deal with hundreds of short videos. I just take
the photos saved in step two and create a daily archival video (more on
that later).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Motion will do much, much more. It will support multiple cameras. It
can handle IP cameras. It can fire off commands when motion is detected
(turn on lights, or alarms, or text you and so on). But I'll leave
those things for BirdCam 3.0! Let's configure motion.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d2580.0x25cbc18"></a>
Motion: Choosing a USB Camera</h2></div></div><p>
You want a camera that is UVC (USB Video-Compatible). It would be nice
if cameras had a nice &ldquo;USB Video-Compatible!&rdquo; sticker on the box, but sadly,
they never do. The good news is that many cameras are compatible,
even if they don't brag about it. You can google for a specific camera
model to see if other folks have used it, or you can check an on-line
database before buying. See <a href="http://www.ideasonboard.org/uvc" target="_self">www.ideasonboard.org/uvc</a>
for a list
of devices known to work, but if you're getting an off-brand model,
you might just have to try it to find out. Interesting to note, if you see a
&ldquo;Certified for Windows Vista&rdquo; sticker, the camera is UVC-compliant,
as that's a requirement for Windows Vista certification.
</p><p>
I chose the Logitech C920 USB camera, which supports 1920x1080 (1080p)
video at 30fps. By default, the camera autofocuses, which sounds like
a great idea. Unfortunately, I found the camera almost never focuses on
what I want, especially if it's very close to the camera, which the birds
tend to be. If you have issues with autofocusing, you might want to try
tweaking the camera on the command-line. I have the following added to
my startup scripts to turn off autofocus, and I set the manual focus to
just outside my window:

<pre     class="programlisting">
uvcdynctrl -s "Focus, Auto" 0
uvcdynctrl -s "Focus (absolute)" 25
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll need to play around with the focus value to get it just right,
but if your camera supports manual focus, you should be able to tweak
it for sharp images that don't need to autofocus every time a bird lands.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d2580.0x29c4180"></a>
Motion: Configuring the Config</h2></div></div><p>
Installing motion is usually nothing more than finding it in your
repositories and installing. You'll probably have to edit a file in
order to get it to start at boot (like the /etc/default/motion file in
Ubuntu), but it's not too painful. It's important to understand a few
things about the default config:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Usually the &ldquo;root&rdquo; folder motion uses by default is in the /tmp
folder. This could cause issues on your system if you just leave it
alone and let it run&mdash;it could fill your /tmp partition and make your
system break.
</p></li><li><p>
Motion uses /dev/video0 by default. This is good, as it most likely
is the device name of your USB camera. If you have a funky camera though,
you might need to change the device setting.
</p></li><li><p>
When you make a change to the configuration file, you need to restart
motion for it to take effect. That generally means running <tt  >sudo service
motion restart</tt> or something similar.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Next, open the config file (as root), and make some changes. I'll name
the directive to search for below, then talk a bit about the settings. These
configuration directives should all be in your /etc/motion/motion.conf
file. You'll just need to modify these values:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >width</tt>:
I use <tt  >width 1280</tt> for my camera. Even though it supports 1080p,
I actually only record at 720p (1280x720). It saves space and still
produces HD quality content.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >height</tt>:
in order to get the proper aspect ratio, I set this to <tt  >height
720</tt>. Note, my camera will take photos only with the 16x9 aspect
ratio, even if I set it to something else.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >framerate</tt>:
this is how many frames are captured per second. I use <tt  >framerate
15</tt>,
which provides fairly smooth motion while saving the most disk space. With
the Raspberry Pi, I could get around 5fps with a 640x480 camera before
the CPU load maxed out.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >threshold</tt>:
this is how many pixels must change before the program triggers a motion
event. I left the default, then tweaked it later. My setting currently
is <tt  >threshold 2500</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >minimum_motion_frames</tt>:
by default, this is set to 1. I found that occasional camera glitches
would fire off a motion event, even if nothing moved. Setting this to 2
or 3 will make sure there's actual motion and not a camera glitch. Mine
is <tt  >minimum_motion_frames 2</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >quality</tt>:
the default quality of 75 is probably fine, but I really wanted a sharp
image, especially since I spent almost $100 on a camera. I set this to
<tt  >quality 95</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >ffmpeg_cap_new</tt>:
this is the setting that will tell motion to record videos. I had this
&ldquo;on&rdquo;
at first (it defaults to &ldquo;off&rdquo;), but I ended up with hundreds of short little
videos. If you turn it on, fiddle with the other ffmpeg options as well.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >snapshot_interval</tt>:
this will capture a single image every <span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> seconds. I have it set to
<tt  >snapshot_interval 1</tt> and use the image for embedding into BirdCam.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >target_dir</tt>:
this setting is very important. This directory will be the
&ldquo;root&rdquo;
directory of all files created by motion. Both photo and video files
are kept in this directory, so although using the ramdisk might sound like
a good idea, it probably will fill up quickly.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >snapshot_filename</tt>:
this will be the periodic snapshot filename. I set it to a single
filename so that it is overwritten constantly, but you can leave it
with the datestring stuff so it will keep all the files. This filename
is relative to <tt  >target_dir</tt>, so if you try to set an absolute path, it
still will be relative to <tt  >target_dir</tt>. You can, however, add a directory
name. On my system, <tt  >target_dir</tt> is /home/birds, and I have a symbolic
link inside /home/birds named ram, which points to a folder inside
the /dev/shm ramdisk. I then set <tt  >snapshot_filename
ram/windowcam</tt>,
and it overwrites the windowcam.jpg file in my ramdisk every second. This
saves wear and tear on my hard drive.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >jpeg_filename</tt>:
this directive is similar to <tt  >snapshot_filename</tt>, but
instead, it's
where the 15 images per second are stored. This is one you don't want
to redirect to a ramdisk, unless you have an enormous ramdisk. I
kept the default string for naming the files. My setting puts the
photos in a separate folder, so it looks like this: <tt  >jpeg_filename
photos/%Y-%m-%d_%H.%M.%S-%q</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >movie_filename</tt>:
this is what determines the name and location of the ffmpeg videos. I'm
not saving ffmpeg videos anymore, so my setting is moot, but this is
where you assign folder and name location. Even though mine isn't used
anymore, my setting from when I did record video is <tt  >movie_filename
movies/%Y-%m-%d_%H.%M.%S</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >webcam_port</tt>:
by default, this is set to 0, which means the Webcam is disabled. On
a Raspberry Pi, I don't recommend turning this on, but on my Intel
i5-based system, I have it set to port 8081. It creates a live MJPEG
stream that can be viewed from a browser or IP camera-viewing software
(like from an Android tablet).
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >webcam_maxrate</tt>:
this determines frames per second. I have this set to 10, which is fast
enough to see motion, but it doesn't tax the server.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >webcam_localhost</tt>:
by default, this is set to &ldquo;on&rdquo;, which means only the localhost can view
the Webcam stream. If you want to view it remotely, even from other
computers on your LAN, you'll need to change this to &ldquo;off&rdquo;.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Although that seems like a huge number of options to fiddle with, many of
the defaults will be fine for you. Once you're happy with the settings,
type <tt  >sudo service motion restart</tt>, and the server should re-read your
config file and start doing what you configured it to do.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d2580.0x29c5d58"></a>
100,000 Photos?</h2></div></div><p>
I probably could talk about the fun things I do with my BirdCam server for
two or three more articles. Who knows, maybe I'll visit the topic again. Before
I close this chapter though, I want to share a cool thing I do to archive
the bird visits for a given day. I mentioned that I end up with more than
100,000 photos a day from detected motion, and quite honestly, looking
through that many photos is no fun. So at the end of every day, I create
an MP4 video using the images captured. I've tried a few different tools,
but the easiest to configure is mencoder. If you get mencoder installed
(it should be in your repositories), you can turn those photos into a
movie like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mencoder "mf:///home/birds/photos/*.jpg" \
  -o /home/birds/archive/`date +"%Y-%m-%d"`-WindowCam.avi -fps 15 \
  -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:mbd=2:trell:vbitrate=7000
</pre>
</p><p>
I run that command from cron every evening after sundown. Then I delete
the images, and I'm ready for the next day. What I end up with is a
2&ndash;3 hour video every day showing all the bird visits at my window. It
might seem like a lame video, but I usually scrub through it the next
morning to see if there are any new or exotic birds visiting. The
videos are 4&ndash;6GB each, so if storage space is an issue for you,
it's something to keep in mind&mdash;which brings me to the next, and final,
cool addition to BirdCam.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24d2580.0x29c5fc0"></a>
The Most Boring YouTube Channel Ever</h2></div></div><p>
I want to be able to watch my archived video from anywhere. It's possible
to stream my local media via Plex or something direct like that, but
it would mean I had to connect to my home network in order to see the
birds. Now that YouTube has removed the 10 or 15 minute limit on YouTube
accounts, it means I can upload a three-hour archive video of birds at
my window to YouTube, and have them store and display my video in the
cloud&mdash;and for free!
</p><p>
Because this is Linux, I wanted to find a way to script the uploading
and naming of my daily video. Thankfully, there's a really cool program
called ytu, which stands for YouTube Uploader. It's simple, but very
powerful. Download it at <a href="http://tasvideos.org/YoutubeUploader.html" target="_self">tasvideos.org/YoutubeUploader.html</a>.
</p><p>
The most difficult part of running ytu is that you need a
developer key. You can become a developer and get a developer key
at <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard/gwt/index.html" target="_self">https://code.google.com/apis/youtube/dashboard/gwt/index.html</a>. 
It's not difficult, but the URLs keep changing, so I can't give you a
more specific link. Once you have your developer key (a long string of
letters and numbers), you can fill out the credentials.txt file with:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Google e-mail address.
</p></li><li><p>
Google password in plain text.
</p></li><li><p>
Developer key.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Make sure only the account executing the ytu binary has access to the
file, as your password is stored in plain text. If this security
problem isn't acceptable, you can, of course, upload videos to
YouTube manually. I actually have a separate Google account for uploading BirdCam
videos, so I'm not as concerned with the security.
</p><p>
Once the credentials file is set, you invoke ytu from the command line, or
in my case, from the same cron job that creates the video. After the video
is created, I immediately start ytu to upload it to YouTube. After several
hours of uploading and processing, the video is ready to watch. If you'd
like to see my archived videos, just surf over to <a href="http://snar.co/windowcam" target="_self">snar.co/windowcam</a>
and see all the past videos.

It Doesn't Have to Be Birds!</h2></div></div><p>
Obviously, I have a mild obsession with birdwatching. We all have
our quirks. With this article, and my last BirdCam article, hopefully
you can figure out a way to adapt the power of Linux to scratch that
video-capturing itch you have. If you do end up with something similar,
or even something drastically different (dogcam on the local fire
hydrant?), I'd love to hear about it! Well, maybe not the fire-hydrant
cam...that's a little too strange, even for me.
