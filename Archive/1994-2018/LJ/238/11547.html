PaaS is a cloud service model that allows you to develop, deploy
and run business applications swiftly.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203c580.0x21342a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Generally, good programming is considered to be the measured application
of an art form, craft or discipline, with the objective of producing
a competent and evolving business solution. In traditional environments,
computer programming is a practice that has multiple phases, such as
designing, developing, testing, debugging and maintaining application
code. We programmers use programming languages like C, C++, C#, Java,
Python and Smalltalk to create business applications. The process
of writing code often requires proficiency in many diverse subjects,
including knowledge of the application domain, runtime environment,
specific algorithms, programming languages and proper logic.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11547f1.large.jpg"><img src="11547f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Programming
</p></div></div><p>
In addition, developing and deploying applications is a complex,
expensive and time-consuming task. Business applications require
hardware resources, operating systems, databases, middleware, Web
servers and other software. Once the technology stack and hardware
resources are available, a team of developers needs to navigate frameworks,
such as J2EE and .NET, for development. A dedicated team of network,
database and IT management experts keeps resources and applications
available. 
</p><p>
Inevitably, business requirements will require changes
in the application, which results in a lengthy development, testing and
re-deployment cycle. Furthermore, large organizations need specialized
facilities to house their data centers and a team to maintain them. A
gigantic amount of electricity is used to power the servers as well as
to keep them cool.
</p><p>
If you think the complexities end here, then wait. A failover site holds
significant importance to mirror the data center so that information and
resources can be replicated in case of disaster. Applications built
with these complexities are difficult to scale for usage spike demands,
fragile to update, and difficult to make mobile and social as business
needs change.

Modern Application Programming and Its Challenges</h2></div></div><p>
Modern programming has changed in a different manner due to the explosion of
devices. Expanding data and new business requirements need different
approaches from the previous era. Considering either the traditional approach or
modern approach, business applications must satisfy some fundamental
properties, such as automation, reliability, robustness, performance and
availability. Unfortunately, even in modern times, automated build and
test environments don't exist in many organizations, and best practices
are not applied everywhere in the software development life cycle.
</p><p>
It is important to understand that an application's reliability depends
on the accuracy of algorithms, fewer programming mistakes, the implementation of
security best practices, and avoiding logic errors, such as division
by zero. Anticipating errors, such as incorrect or compromised data
and unavailability of resources, increases robustness. How
well application developers and IT teams manage robustness holds more
significance in achieving the application's objectives. Efficiency,
performance, maintainability, portability and availability of an
application are equally important in modern environments. Cloud computing
is a revolutionary approach that provides a ray of hope for
organizations dealing with these modern challenges.

Introducing PaaS</h2></div></div><p>
Cloud computing is still an evolving paradigm, but it is one of the most
disruptive innovations in the past few years. According to the definition from
NIST, it is the model to enable convenient and on-demand network access
to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, such as compute,
storage and network, that can be provisioned rapidly and released with
minimal management effort.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11547f2.large.jpg"><img src="11547f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. NIST Definition of Cloud Computing
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203c580.0x2134b40"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
PaaS providers manage underlying infrastructure resources, such as
operating systems, virtual servers, networks, Web servers, application
servers, databases, backup and disaster recovery.
</p></div><p>
Cloud computing is composed of three service models: Software as a Service
(SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service
(IaaS). This article focuses on PaaS.
</p><p>
With PaaS, you can deploy applications into the cloud infrastructure using
supported programming languages (such as Java, PHP, Ruby and .Net) and
platforms/tools (such as Web servers/application servers and databases).
This enables PaaS
users or organizations to focus on their business and application
maintenance rather than having to worry about managing resources, platforms
and software versions.
</p><p>
PaaS resides within the space between SaaS and IaaS. IaaS provides
network, storage and compute processing capabilities. Examples of IaaS
offerings include Amazon EC2, Windows Azure VM Role and RackSpace Cloud
Servers. SaaS delivers business software capabilities, such as CRM.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11547f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. PaaS 
</p></div></div><p>
PaaS includes not only the deployment environment, but it also includes
repositories, build environments, testing environments, performance
management, mail services, log services, database services, big data
services, search services, enterprise messaging services and application
performance management for modern application architectures and code
inspection services.
</p><p>
PaaS is becoming popular because it eliminates the cost and complexity of
acquisition, installation, configuration, evaluation, experimentation
and management of all the hardware and software resources needed to run
business applications. PaaS provides the infrastructure and platform
needed to develop and run applications. By using PaaS, organizations can
utilize budgets to develop applications that provide real business value.
</p><p>
PaaS is driving a new era of innovation and business agility. Development
and IT teams use PaaS to design, experiment, build, test and deliver
customized applications. Hence, application developers and IT teams can
focus on application and domain expertise for their business, rather
than managing complex hardware and software resources.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203c580.0x2135170"></a>
Benefits of PaaS</h2></div></div><p>
Two significant benefits of using PaaS are cost benefits and faster
development and deployment cycles. PaaS provides agility, flexibility
and faster time to market to the development, testing and deployment
cycles and, hence, focus remains on the application and not in managing
resources. It ensures access to resources from anywhere in the world. By
using PaaS, user satisfaction increases, and at the same time, resource
utilization improves. It provides underlying software and hardware
resources on a pay-as-you-go billing model, so it reduces the capital
expenditure associated with large amounts of server and storage space,
power, cooling, management and maintenance of software updates and
changes, and skilled personnel. With almost zero capital expenditure,
horizontal or vertical scaling features can increase the application's
performance. It does not involve local installation, so adoption
speed is usually high. The PaaS platform ensures that consumers don't
need to keep investing in OS upgrades and maintenance. It is
the PaaS provider's responsibility to manage infrastructure and platform
resources so organizations don't need to worry about licenses,
versions of software, patch management and so on. Furthermore, flexibility
and availability of resources improves collaboration between the
development and testing teams.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11547f4.large.jpg"><img src="11547f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. PaaS Benefits
</p></div></div><p>
PaaS offers surprising benefits in deployment and management tasks
considering the fact that most organizations opt for PaaS solutions
based on the environment that is already standardized in their internal
environment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203c580.0x2135488"></a>
How to Deploy Applications in PaaS</h2></div></div><p>Here are the basic steps:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Select the application type, programming language for developing the
application, platform to run the application, build environment and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
Create business or Web applications using an IDE, such as Eclipse, NetBeans
or any other IDE.
</p></li><li><p>
Create a database using available database products.
</p></li><li><p>
Change the database configuration accordingly in the application.
</p></li><li><p>
Create an archive file&mdash;for example, a WAR or EAR file.
</p></li><li><p>
Upload the archive file to the PaaS Portal.
</p></li><li><p>
Configure log, e-mail, backup and scaling services.
</p></li><li><p>
Access your application.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203c580.0x2135b68"></a>
Major PaaS Providers and Offerings in Cloud Services</h2></div></div><p>
PaaS services provide an opportunity to increase customers, boost
revenue, add value to existing services and gain broader adoption of
cloud services among business customers. Application development is a
core capability, while additional capabilities often play to the cloud
provider's brand building and strengths. To prepare for the PaaS, cloud
providers are developing flexible cloud platforms to support a variety
of functions for the cloud environment and processes. Examples of PaaS include,
but are not limited to, Force.com, Microsoft Azure, Engine Yard, Heroku,
CloudBees and Google App Engine.

Security in PaaS</h2></div></div><p>
It is essential that application developers are thoroughly experienced
in application security best practices. This can include secure
coding practices in the proffered language as well as in secure design
principles. Unlike traditional application development, PaaS offers a
shared development environment, so authentication, authorization
and access control can be combined to ensure consumers' data and
application security. It is also important to scan Web applications
for common security issues, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL
injection. To refine development efforts to produce secure and robust
applications, application threat modeling is critical. OWASP threat
modeling can be used to create secure applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x203c580.0x212cdf0"></a>
Future of PaaS</h2></div></div><p>
Many IaaS providers are moving up in the stack of service models. AWS is
one of the examples. Today, the market for PaaS may be the smallest proportion of the
overall public cloud. But, it will have huge implications in application
developers' roles and responsibilities. Nearly half of respondents
(49.6%) to the 2013 TechTarget Cloud Pulse Survey said they chose the
PaaS they did because it was part of a cloud ecosystem they already
were using. Similarly, 43% of respondents said they based their decision on
how well the PaaS would integrate with existing architecture. Now, PaaS
providers have realized that it will be more beneficial from a market and
competition point of view to run services across several IaaS providers'
architectures. Some providers are providing private versions of their
PaaS offering, so organizations can use the same services in their existing
facilities to utilize existing resources in a better manner.
