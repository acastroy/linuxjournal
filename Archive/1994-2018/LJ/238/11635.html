Own Your DNS Data

Why make it easy for people to capture your complete Internet
browsing history?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e94580.0x1f8c3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I honestly think most people simply are unaware of how much personal
data they leak on a daily basis as they use their computers. Even if they
have some inkling along those lines, I still imagine many
think of the data they leak only in terms of individual facts, such as
their name or where they ate lunch. What many people don't realize is
how revealing all of those individual, innocent facts are when they are
combined, filtered and analyzed. 
</p><p>
Cell-phone metadata (who you called,
who called you, the length of the call and what time the call happened)
falls under this category, as do all of the search queries you enter on
the Internet (more on how to secure that in a future column).
</p><p>
For this column, I discuss a common but often
overlooked source of data that is far too revealing: your DNS data. You
see, although you may give an awful lot of personal marketing data to Google
with every search query you type, that still doesn't capture all of
the sites you visit outside Google searches either directly, via RSS
readers or via links your friends send you. That's why the implementation
of Google's free DNS service on 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 is so genius&mdash;search
queries are revealing, but when you capture all of someone's DNS traffic,
you get the complete picture of every site they visit on the Internet
and beyond that, even every non-Web service (e-mail, FTP, P2P traffic and
VoIP), provided that the service uses hostnames instead of IP addresses.
</p><p>
Let me back up a bit. DNS is one of the core services that
runs on the Internet, and its job is to convert a hostname, like 
www.linuxjournal.com, into an IP address, such as 76.74.252.198. Without
DNS, the Internet as we know it today would cease to function, because
basically every site we visit in a Web browser, and indeed, just about
every service we use on the Internet, we get to via its hostname and
not its IP. That said, the only way we actually can reach a host on the
Internet is via its IP address, so when you decide to visit a site, its
hostname is converted into an IP address to which your browser then opens
up a connection. Note that via DNS caching and TTL (Time To Live)
settings, you may not have to send out a DNS query every time you visit
a site. All the same, these days TTLs are short enough (often ranging
between one minute to an hour or two&mdash;www.linuxjournal.com's TTL is
30 minutes) that if I captured all your DNS traffic for a day,
I'd be able to tell you every Web site you visited along with the first
time that day you visited it. If the TTL is short enough, I probably
could tell you every time you went there.
</p><p>
Most people tend to use whatever DNS servers they have been provided. On
a corporate network, you are likely to get a set of DNS servers over
DHCP when you connect to the network. This is important because many
corporate networks have internal resources and internal hostnames
that you would be able to resolve only if you talked to an internal
name server. 
</p><p>
Although many people assume very little privacy at work,
home is a different matter. At home, you are most likely to use the DNS
servers your ISP provided you, while others use Google's DNS servers
because the IPs are easy to remember. This means even if others
can't intercept your traffic (maybe you are sending it through a VPN,
or maybe that kind of line tapping simply requires more legal standing),
if they can get access to your DNS logs (I could see some arguing that
this qualifies as metadata), they would have a fairly complete view
of all the sites you visit without your ever knowing. 
</p><p>
This is not just
valuable data from a surveillance standpoint, or a privacy standpoint,
but also from a marketing standpoint. Even if you may be fine with the
government knowing what porn sites you browse, where you shop, where
you get your news and what e-mail provider you use, you may not want a
marketing firm to have that data.

Recursive DNS vs. DNS Caching</h2></div></div><p>
The key to owning your DNS data and keeping it private is to run your own
DNS server and use it for all of your outbound DNS queries. Although many
people already run some sort of DNS caching programs, such as dnsmasq
to speed up DNS queries, what you want isn't simply a DNS cache, but
something that can function as a recursive DNS resolver. In the case
of dnsmasq, it is configured to use upstream recursive DNS servers to
do all of the DNS heavy lifting (the documentation recommends you use
whatever DNS servers you currently have in /etc/resolv.conf). Thus,
all of your DNS queries for www.linuxjournal.com go to your DNS caching
software and then are directed to, for instance, your ISP's DNS servers
before they do the traditional recursive DNS procedure of starting at
root name servers, then going to com, then finally to the name servers
for linuxjournal.com. So, all of your queries still get logged at the
external recursive DNS server.
</p><p>
What you want is a local DNS service that can do the complete recursive
DNS query for you. In the case of a request for www.linuxjournal.com,
it would communicate with the root, com and linuxjournal.com name servers
directly without an intermediary and ultimately cache the results
like any other DNS caching server. For outside parties to capture
all of your DNS logs, they either would have to compromise your local,
personal DNS server on your home network, set up a tap to collect all
of your Internet traffic or set up a tap at all the
root name servers. All three of these options are either illegal
or require substantial court oversight.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e94580.0x1f8c988"></a>
Install and Configure Your DNS Server</h2></div></div><p>
So, even when you rule out pure DNS caching software, there still
are a number of different DNS servers you can choose from, including BIND,
djbdns and unbound, among others. I personally have the most experience
with BIND, so that's what I prefer, but any of those would do the job. The
nice thing about BIND, particularly in the case of the Debian and Ubuntu
packages, is that all you need to do is run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo apt-get install bind9
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e94580.0x1f8cae8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and after the software installs, BIND automatically is configured to act
as a local recursive DNS server for your internal network. The procedure
also would be the same if you were to set this up on a spare Raspberry
Pi running the Raspbian distribution. On other Linux distributions,
the package may just be called bind. 
</p><p>
If BIND isn't automatically
configured as a local recursive DNS server on your particular Linux
distribution and doesn't appear to work out of the box, just locate the
options section of your BIND config (often in /etc/bind/named.conf,
/etc/bind/named.conf.options or /etc/named/named.conf, depending on
the distribution), and if you can't seem to perform recursive queries,
add the following line under the <tt  >options{}</tt> section:


<pre     class="programlisting">
options {
  allow-recursion { 10/8; 172.16/12; 192.168/16; 127.0.0.1; };
. . .
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This change allows any hosts on those networks (internal RFC1918 IP
addresses) to perform recursive queries on your name server without
allowing the world to do so.
</p><p>
Once you have BIND installed, you'll want to test it. If you installed
BIND on your local machine, you could test this out with the
<tt  >dig</tt> command:


<pre     class="programlisting">

$ dig @localhost www.linuxjournal.com
; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.1-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @localhost www.linuxjournal.com
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 17485

</pre>
</p><p>
Otherwise, replace localhost with the IP address of your Raspberry Pi or
whatever machine on which you installed BIND. To use this name server for all
of your requests, update your /etc/resolv.conf file so that it contains:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nameserver 127.0.0.1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e94580.0x1f8d010"></a></h2></div></div><p>
as its only <tt  >nameserver</tt> line. Replace 127.0.0.1 with the IP address of the
machine you installed BIND on if it isn't on the same machine. On some
modern distributions, there are external tools that tweak /etc/resolv.conf
for you, so in those cases, you may have to edit your dhclient.conf or
other network configuration files so that you can override the provided
list of name servers. Once you do that though, really that's all there
is to it. Now you can use DNS knowing that all of your DNS search data
sits on a machine under your control.
