<i  >Linux Journal</i>. Don Marti, formerly technical
editor of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and editor in chief of
<i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i>, will be stepping into
the role of editor in chief. As you must already know, you will be
in most capable hands with Don, and I can assure you it will never
be boring.
</p><p>Few things inspire close human relationships like shared
labor. Creating <i  >Linux Journal</i> on a monthly
basis and tackling the various other projects that come with being
on the editorial staff of SSC make for a rigorous schedule and a
lot of unused vacation time. As the <i  >LJ</i> staff
is a small one, we've gotten to know one another quite well. I've
come to appreciate them not only for their competence and
willingness to go the extra mile, but for their qualities as
wonderful human beings. I'm a better person for having worked with
them, and I feel confident they will continue to serve the
magazine's readers very well.</p><p>Though I've been editor of <i  >Linux Journal</i>
for two years, I have met personally only two of our contributing
editors. Yet, working with them on a monthly basis, I feel about
them much as I feel about our in-house editorial staff. Many times
their help and contributions go far beyond writing their monthly
column&mdash;though their pay doesn't. I've abused and taken advantage
of them, rewarding them with nothing more than my gratitude (I told
them all I'd be their best friend) and <i  >LJ</i>
shwag, and they've accepted it graciously.</p><p>On this same page in the 100th issue, I cited the goodwill of
the Linux community as something that makes working for this
magazine a rewarding experience. That generosity made our 100th
issue possible and is one more thing that makes leaving this job
difficult. Our authors invest a lot of time and energy into
providing information that is both accurate and useful, and believe
me, they don't do it for the money. In many of the article
proposals we receive, the potential author states a feeling of
obligation to contribute to the community as the principal
motivation for writing.</p><p>Given that our writers are, in most cases, our readers, we
have the advantage of getting to know our audience very well. This
makes saying good-bye more difficult, but my thanks more
genuine.</p><p>So good-bye and sincere thanks to the staff, contributors and
readers of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It's been a
memorable two years.</p></div></div>
