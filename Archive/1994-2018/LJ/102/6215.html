used clusters to meet its carrier-grade requirements of high
availability, reliability and scalability, while relying on
cost-effective hardware and software. Efficient cluster security is
now an essential requirement that has not yet been addressed in a
coherent fashion.
</p><p>To answer the need for advanced security features on Linux
clusters in the telecom world, the Open Systems Lab at Ericsson
Research (Montr&eacute;al, Canada) started a project called
Distributed Security Infrastructure (DSI). The main goal of DSI is
to design and develop a secure infrastructure that provides
advanced security mechanisms for telecom applications running on
carrier-grade Linux clusters. One important component of DSI is the
distributed security module (DSM), which provides an implementation
of mandatory access control within a Linux cluster.</p><p>In this article, we discuss the goals of having a distributed
security module, architecture, features, performance and
implementation status. We also offer a tutorial that explains how
to install DSM and experiment with it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x19677c0"></a>Mandatory Access Control</h2></div></div><p>Currently implemented security mechanisms rely on
discretionary access-control mechanisms. These mechanisms, however,
are inadequate to protect against the various kinds of attacks
possible in today's complex environments. Access decisions are
based on user identity and ownership. As a consequence, these
mechanisms are easy to bypass, and malicious applications easily
can cause failures and breaches in system security.</p><p>Various research results have shown that mandatory security
provided by the operating system is essential for the security of
the whole system. Furthermore, they proved that mandatory
access-control mechanisms are efficient for supporting complex
relationships between different entities in the computing
environment.</p><p>As part of the DSI Project, we address the design and
implementation of a framework for mandatory access control. We are
implementing cluster-aware access-control mechanisms as a Linux
loadable module. Our work in this area will help position Linux as
a secure operating system for clustered servers.</p><p>Our work is based mainly on the Flask architecture and the
Linux security module (LSM) framework; however, our focus is on
Linux clustered servers, not single Linux servers. We address the
performance challenges of the cluster security because enforcing
security may introduce degradation in system performance, an
increase in administration and some annoyance for the user.</p><p>One important aspect of our DSM implementation is its
distributed nature. This aspect provides location transparency of
the security resources in the cluster from the security point of
view.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x1967a28"></a>Linux Security Module (LSM)</h2></div></div><p>The LSM framework does not provide any additional security in
the Linux kernel. Rather, it provides the infrastructure to support
the development of security modules. The LSM kernel patch adds
security fields to kernel data structures and inserts calls (called
hooks) at special points in the kernel code to perform a
module-specific access-control check.</p><p>LSM adds methods for registering and unregistering security
modules, in addition to a general security system call that allows
communication between user programs and the LSM for security-aware
applications. Each LSM hook is a function pointer in a global
structure called security_ops. Because the hooks are embedded in
the kernel and are called even before a security module is
installed, this structure is initialized to a set of functions
provided by a dummy security module. These functions are simply
placeholders for more useful security mechanisms that can be loaded
as a Linux module. A register_security method is introduced to
allow a security module to set its own security functions to
overlay the dummy functions. An unregister_security method is used
to return to the dummy functions.</p><p>The LSM methods are organized into two categories: 1) hooks
to handle the security fields and 2) hooks to perform access
control. When a Linux resource is created, the security label is
attached to it. These labels are used to enforce mandatory access
control with the security hooks. When the object is destroyed, the
label is removed. Hooks to handle the security fields are used for
label creation and removal. An example of those hooks are
alloc_security and free_security in the task_security_ops
structure. The process of mandatory access control using LSM is
presented in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6215f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Access Control with LSM Module
</p></div></div><p>Let's assume that the subject (a process in this case) has a
security ID of SSec and is trying to access (1) the resource (a
file in this case) having the security ID TSec. To perform the
access, the subject issues the system call (2). The system call is
handled by the Linux kernel code (the system call interface in
Figure 1). Before the access decision is taken, the kernel consults
(using security hooks) the LSM module (3), where the user-specific
security is implemented as a function &ldquo;f&rdquo;. LSM will compute the
function &ldquo;f&rdquo; and return the results to the kernel. The kernel
will then either grant or deny access to the target resource
(4).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x1967df0"></a>The Distributed Security Module (DSM)</h2></div></div><p>The distributed security module is part of DSI. The purpose
of implementing DSM is to enforce access control and to provide
labeling for the IP messages across the nodes of the cluster with
the security attributes of the sending process and node.</p><p>We started the development of DSM using Linux kernel 2.4.17
and the appropriate security patch for that kernel version
(lsm-full-2002_01_15-2.4.17.patch). The implementation of DSM was
based on CIPSO and FIPS-188 standards, which specify the IP header
modification (adding options to IP header), and on hooks added to
the IP stack.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x1967f50"></a>Distributed Security Infrastructure
(DSI)</h2></div></div><p>Because DSM is a component of DSI, let's briefly look at it.
As part of a carrier-grade Linux cluster, DSI must comply with
carrier-grade requirements such as reliability, scalability and
high availability. Furthermore, DSI supports the following
requirements: coherent framework, process-level approach,
pre-preemptive security, dynamic security policy, transparent key
management and minimal impact on performance.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6215f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. DSI Architecture
</p></div></div><p>The security server is the central point of management. It is
the central security authority for all other security components in
the system, and it is responsible for the distributed security
policy. It also defines the dynamic security environment of the
whole cluster by broadcasting changes in the distributed policy to
all security managers.</p><p>Security managers enforce security locally at each node of
the cluster. They are responsible for enforcing changes in the
security environment. Security managers only exchange security
information with the security server. For a detailed description of
DSI, see Resources.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x19682c0"></a>Distributed Access-Control Architecture</h2></div></div><p>Designing an efficient solution to the cluster mandatory
access control is a complex task. Many factors are involved in
defining the access rights, because the subjects and resources can
be located on different nodes in the cluster. To simplify the
relationships, we can handle the access control at two levels. At
the local level, the subject and resource are located on the same
node while on the remote level, the subject and resource are
located on different nodes.</p><p>For local access control, the access rights are the functions
of the security IDs of the subject (SSID) and the resource (TSID),
see Figure 1. This equation is based on the FLASK architecture:
Access = Function (SSID, TSID).</p><p>The FLASK architecture can serve as a solution for
single-node processing. When the nodes are presented as a cluster,
security solutions become more complicated. In this case, we extend
the FLASK architecture to the cluster remote access model (Figure
3).</p><p>One of the new parameters is the security node ID (SnID), an
ID that, as the name implies, defines the node in terms of
security. Access rights are not only the function of the subject
and target security IDs, but the function of the security node ID
as well.</p><p>The architecture of the distributed access control is
illustrated in Figure 3. The equation of the architecture can be
described as Access = Function (SnID2, SID2, SnID1, SID1).</p><p>An important part of the distributed system is the network,
which spans the nodes of the cluster. To apply the access control
functions in the cluster, there must be a way to pass the security
parameters between the nodes in a transparent fashion. Our
prototype implementation of distributed mandatory access control
will be exercised in the Linux kernel, which provides us security
transparency and better performance.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6215f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Distributed Access-Control Architecture
</p></div></div><p>In Figure 3, we illustrate an example of how the distributed
access control works. The security server is responsible for
passing the security policy to the security module. It is also
responsible for providing the security node ID to each node of the
cluster (1). Let's assume the subject2 in node SnID2 tries to
access a resource (file) on the node SnID1 (2). In this case
subject2 first must get access to the local communication resources
(3) and then get a pair of identifiers (SnID2, SID2) that then must
be passed to the remote node (4). Those identifiers will be
validated on the remote node SnID1. When the access is granted, the
message can be passed to process 1 (5). Now process 1 will perform
an access on behalf of process 2 (6).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x1968790"></a>Access Control on a Node</h2></div></div><p>In greater detail, this section explains what happens on a
single node of a cluster. Access control on any node of the cluster
consists of two parts (Figure 4):</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Kernel space: responsible for implementing both the
enforcement and the decision-making tasks of access control as
separate responsibilities. The kernel space maintains the security
policy upon which it bases its decisions. The security policy is
supplied by the security server and stored in the local memory for
fast access (hash table).</p></li><li><p>User space: its many responsibilities (Figure 4)
include taking the information from the distributed security policy
(1) and from the security context repository, combining them
together and feeding them to the kernel space part in an easily
usable form (2, 3 and 4). It propagates alarms from the kernel
space back to the security manager, which will feed them to the
auditing and logging services and, if necessary, propagate them to
the security server through the security communication channel (see
Figure 2).</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6215f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Access Control on a Node
</p></div></div><p>Both kernel space and user space are started and monitored by
the local security manager (SM) on each node. The SM also
introduces them to other services and subsystems of DSI with which
they need to interact. When a user process tries to access the
system resource (5), the system call is forwarded to DSM (6), where
the decision is made based on the DSP internal representation
(7).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x1968c60"></a>Labels</h2></div></div><p>All the subjects and resources must be labeled. Because the
security module can be loaded at runtime, we distinguish two modes
of subject labeling:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Before the module is loaded, no labels are attached
to any subject or resource in the system. At module initialization
time, all the running tasks are scanned, and labels are attached to
them.</p></li><li><p>When a new process is created after the security
module is loaded, the security hooks do the labeling.</p></li></ol></div><p>Since Linux stores the process descriptor and the kernel mode
process stack in a single 8KB memory area, we can use this fact and
avoid allocating memory for labeling the subjects (Figure 5).
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6215f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Task Security Label Allocation
</p></div></div>

</p><p>The other labels are attached to the resources at runtime,
which implies that the module checks if the label is there. If the
label is not attached, a new label will be created.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x195fa18"></a>Network Labels</h2></div></div><p>Because access in the cluster can be achieved from a subject
located on one node to a resource located on another node (Figure
3), additionally there is a need to control such accesses.</p><p>When a process on one node accesses a resource on another
node, local access to the communications resources (socket, network
interface) is checked first. When local access is granted, the
message can be sent to the remote location.</p><p>In order to identify the sending subject, the Security Node
ID (security node identifier) and the Security ID of the subject
(security subject identifier) are added to the IP packet. For this
implementation, we use the IP protocol for the security information
transfer. A new option based on the hooks in the IP protocol stack
is added after the IP header. On the receiving side, this
information (Security Node ID and Security SID) is extracted (based
on the hooks in the IP stack) and used to build the network
security ID (NSID). The build equation of this is NSID = Function
(SnID, SID).</p><p>This function can be specified by the security server in the
form of a conversion table (for the current implementation a simple
mathematical function is used). The receiving side extracts the
Security Network ID by looking in the table and specifying SnID and
SID. Now the security network ID can be used as a local label to
all of the access controls.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x195fc28"></a>Experimenting with the Distributed Security
Module (DSM)</h2></div></div><p>You need to follow several steps to compile, load and
experiment with DSM. For illustration purposes, we assume that your
machine runs Red Hat 7.2 with Linux kernel 2.4.17 (from
<a href="http://kernel.org" target="_self">kernel.org</a>).</p><p>Here are the main steps involved (they are explained in
detail in the following sections):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Apply the LSM patch for kernel 2.4.17.</p></li><li><p>Modify the kernel options and rebuild the kernel
with the new options.</p></li><li><p>Update the boot options in /etc/lilo.conf.</p></li><li><p>Reboot the machine with the new kernel.</p></li><li><p>Compile and load the security module.</p></li><li><p>Perform some testing to validate that the module
works correctly.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x1960258"></a>Rebuilding the Kernel with LSM Options</h2></div></div><p>The distributed security module is based on the LSM
infrastructure, which is a set of hooks added to the kernel that
installs the security patch from the LSM web site. The site
contains many different patches; you need to match the patch with
the appropriate kernel version, in our case kernel 2.4.17.</p><p>Follow these steps to patch the kernel with LSM. First,
download lsm-full-2002_01_15-2.4.17.patch.gz into /usr/src. Then,
unzip the patch:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% gunzip lsm-full-2002_01_15-2.4.17.patch.gz
</pre><p>Next go to the Linux source tree and apply the patch:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% cd /usr/src/linux % patch -p1 &lt;
/usr/src/lsm-full-2002_01_15-2.4.17.patch
</pre>


After applying the appropriate patch, reconfigure the kernel
options to support the distributed security module. Modify the
following options:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>CODE MATURITY LEVEL: the prompt for development
and/or incomplete code/drivers must be set to &ldquo;y&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>LOADABLE MODULE SUPPORT: version information on all
module symbols must be set to &ldquo;n&rdquo; to avoid problems with
versioning.</p></li><li><p>NETWORKING OPTIONS: network packet filtering must
be set to &ldquo;y&rdquo; to enable the net-filtering hooks for IP packet
modification. Kernel httpd acceleration (EXPERIMENTAL) must be set
to &ldquo;m&rdquo;. This option will include tcp_sync_mss in the
kernel.</p></li><li><p>SECURITY OPTIONS: capabilities support should be
set to &ldquo;m&rdquo;, IP networking support set to &ldquo;n&rdquo;, NSA SELinux
Support set to &ldquo;m&rdquo;, NSA SELinux Development Module set to &ldquo;y&rdquo;,
NSA SELinux MLS policy (EXPERIMENTAL) set to &ldquo;n&rdquo;, LSM port of
Openwall (EXPERIMENTAL) set to &ldquo;n&rdquo; and Domain and Type
Enforcement (EXPERIMENTAL) set to &ldquo;n&rdquo;.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>Once you enable support for these options, simply build the
kernel and modules, install them and run LILO normally.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x1960830"></a>Installing and Experimenting with DSM</h2></div></div><p>Because all of the components of DSI are not currently
implemented, we have created some test programs that emulate these
parts, such as loading the security policy and alarm receivers.
Before the module can be used it must be loaded into the kernel by
root:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
% /sbin/insmod lsm.o
</pre><p>Next, the policy must be supplied to the security module. For
this exercise, the security file is a normal ASCII file with four
fields: source security ID; target security ID; class (for now,
only three classes are implemented: fork, socket and network); and
permission.
</p><p>An extract of the policy file goes like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
1 1 1 0x01
1 1 2 0x07
1 1 3 0x01
</pre><p>The policy can be loaded with our test program, called
UpdatePolicy:
<pre     class="programlisting">
% UpdatePolicy policy_file
</pre>


The alarms can be received by our test program, CheckAlarm. The
program is started using <b  >% CheckAlarm</b>. The
default label for a process can be overwritten by changing the
first byte of the padding field in the ELF format of the process
image (which is the eighth byte in the file).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x1960ba0"></a>Test Configuration</h2></div></div><p>We performed three types of testing to develop a preliminary
performance evaluation of the security module. The tests included
process creation with fork, UDP local access and UDP remote access.
The UDP tests were performed with and without IP packet
modification, so as to see how much performance was lost during IP
packet modification.</p><p>These tests were executed on a Pentium III 650MHz machine
with 256MB of RAM. Here are our testing methods:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Process Creation: measures the time required for a
process to fork a child that immediately exits. The parent process
loops 100,000 times, performing fork and wait calls.</p></li><li><p>UDP Local Access: measures the time needed by a
process to send a UDP message. It sends 500,000 UDP messages in a
loop. The sending process does not check whether the message was
sent outside the node, and it does not wait for the confirmation.
In this case, it is not important whether the server has DSM
installed or not.</p></li><li><p>UDP Remote Access Testing: measures the time needed
by a process to send a UDP message and receive a UDP response from
a server. This test sends and receives 100,000 UDP messages in a
loop. The client process will send a new message after receiving
the confirmation from the server. In this case, it is important
that the server runs the DSM software so that permissions are
checked on the receiving side. For our test, the second server is a
Pentium II 300MHz desktop with 128MB RAM.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x186f580.0x1960f68"></a>Performance Tests Results</h2></div></div><p>Based on the testing performed, we present the results in
Table 1 and Table 2. All numbers are in microseconds.</p><p><a href="6215t1.html" target="_self">Performance Results with IP Packet
Modification</a></p><p><a href="6215t2.html" target="_self">Performance Results without IP
Packet Modification</a></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Process Creation Results: we have a 1.2% increase
in overhead, because the system has to perform a permission check
on the fork operation and spend extra time labeling the child
process.</p></li><li><p>UDP Local Access Results: the average overhead for
the setting with the DSM module against the setting without the DSM
module is 20%. This overhead consists of performing a permission
check on the socket, sending a message and sk_buff label attachment
for each message, plus labeling the IP messages. When the IP packet
modification is disabled (Table 2), the overhead drops to
4.2%.</p></li><li><p>UDP Remote Access Results: the average overhead for
the setting with the DSM module against the setting without the DSM
module is 30%. The overhead consists of the following: performing a
permission check on the send socket side, attaching a label to
sk_buff, attaching the security information to the IP message,
retrieving the security information on the receive side, attaching
the network security ID to sk_buff, performing the permission check
on sk_buff, performing the security checking on the socket and
repeating all the above operations on the return message. When the
IP packet modification is disabled (Table 2), the overhead drops to
5.4%.</p></li></ol></div><p>In both UDP testing cases, most of the overhead occurred is
related to IP packet modification. Only a small fraction of the
overhead is caused by the security module.

architecture. So far, we have a basic implementation of DSM. The
performance results we presented must be regarded as upper-bound,
because no single security operation has been optimized.</p><p>We have done some work optimizing the IP packet modification.
The primary results have shown significant improvements. The UDP
local access with IP packet modification (Table 1) has dropped from
20% overhead to 8%. Similarly, the UDP remote access (Table 1) has
dropped from 30% overhead to 14%. These results are promising, and
we see many more opportunities to optimize and reach even lower
overhead. Nevertheless, the results demonstrate the challenges
facing the development of efficient distributed security.</p><p>As far as testing in real environments, we tested the
framework with buffer-overflow attacks. It proved that our current
solution could guard against these types of attacks.</p><p>As a final note, we did our best to describe DSM within the
limited space we have. However, if you would like more details,
please feel free to contact us. We hope you try out the source code
for DSM and the supporting test programs and send us your feedback.
