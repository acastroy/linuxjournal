that gives me 3Mbps on the downstream side and 300Kbps on the
upstream side. It's far better than the 144Kbps symmetrical DSL I
had at my old place. The cable company (Cox High Speed Internet)
doesn't even care if you hook up a WiFi base station. They also
don't require that you buy their cable TV service (which we don't).
Given the hell that other cable and DSL companies put their
customers through, I really appreciate the company's relative
cluefullness.
</p><p>The connection's downstream speed is twice what I had over an
office T1 line last year. But I miss the upstream advantages of
that T1 connection, including the upstream speed, the eight IP
addresses and the absence of restrictions on how I used them. It
was well worth the $100/month fee, which was very cheap as T1
connections go.</p><p>Now that I'm back working out of my house, I'm faced with the
choice between cheap 3Mbps/300Kbps asymmetrical cable for $35 a
month and &ldquo;business services&rdquo; that begin at $99/month. The
business class offers 768/256Kbps service and five IP addresses. If
I want the equivalent of my old T1 service, I'll need to spend $309
per month, and I still only get 512Kbps on the upstream
side.</p><p>In the old days, before Excite@Home failed and Cox was still
Cox@Home (and using the @Home backbone service), the company didn't
limit throughput in either direction. When we first moved to Santa
Barbara, California (where I live now and where all this has been
happening) in early 2001, we rented an apartment near the beach.
When the cable guy came and installed the cable modem, the speed
was flat-out astonishing. I'd download a movie trailer, and it
would arrive in a few moments. I was getting 7Mbps downstream and
3Mbps upstream. It was as if the whole Internet was one big local
hard drive.</p><p>When we moved to our current house, the speed went down, but
not by much. Then, after Cox converted over to its own backbone
services, speeds stabilized at 3Mbps/300Kbps. There is no way I'm
going to be able to serve anything at better than a fraction of T1
speed out of my house, no matter what I pay.</p><p>Which is why I've been paying the big bucks to Xo
Communications to host my personal domain, searls.com. Mostly it's
a place where I archive a lot of files. Some are speeches and
presentations that run up to 20MB and more. At the moment I'm
paying $7.50/month for every 10MB over 100MB that Xo hosts, and
keeping costs down by 404-ing the old stuff. I need bigger, cheaper
storage.</p><p>I've found a hosting service with lower prices, but it's
still a lot more than I'd pay for storage in my own house.</p><p>Which brings me to the big questions here: Why can't I serve
files at high speeds out of my home? Wasn't the Net designed to be
symmetrical in the first place?</p><p>Recently a friend told me that &ldquo;the phone and cable guys are
never going to get what WiFi is about...it's going to spread like
the Net&mdash;in spite of them, not because of them.&rdquo; I agree, because
I believe foundational intentions have permanent influence over
everything that follows. If the Net's founding architects wanted it
to be symmetrical, that's what it will be. The question is, how
long will it take? I'm 55, and I want it to happen in my lifetime.
Will it?</p><p>In January 2002, I wrote about KPIG
(<a href="../093/5571.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5571</a>),
the pioneering radio station that has been webcasting for seven
years. They've been doing it all on Linux and other free and
open-source software. As I write this in mid-July, KPIG ceased
webcasting, because it can't afford the insane royalty rates
imposed by the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. CARP
effectively restricted webcasting to broadcast conglomerates&mdash;none
of which are interested. So internet radio has effectively been
outlawed, and the RIAA is as happy as a maggot on a corpse. It's a
huge victory for the forces of asymmetry. And it won't be the last
one.</p><p>How long before the broadband distributors start trying to
stomp out WiFi, which has been spreading like a weed? To my
knowledge, not a single major bandwidth provider has stepped
forward to embrace the WiFi movement, in spite of its obvious
popularity. Instead, several recently have issued warnings to
customers who spread bandwidth wirelessly around their
neighborhoods.</p><p>It's hard for the big bandwidth providers even to begin
conceiving the Net as anything other than an asymmetrical medium
for the distribution of &ldquo;content&rdquo;, most of which is owned by
somebody in the entertainment business. And it's also hard to
conceive of bandwidth ownership passing to more enlightened
hands.</p><p>But more and more consumers have also become producers&mdash;not
only of goods for sale, but of opinions and influence. Sooner or
later we're going to come through, thanks to our own personal
technologies.</p><p>We have two secret weapons&mdash;so secret most of us don't even
know we have them. One is the digital camcorder; the other is the
digital camera. We're going to be making more and more movies and
slide shows, and we're going to want to put them on the Web to
share with our families, coworkers and customers. Unless the prices
come way down, way fast, remote servers will remain too expensive.
And it'll make much more sense simply to serve our stuff off a
household hard drive. When that happens, there's going to be a
barnstorm business in Cobalt Qubes and other breeds of Linux boxes.
When that happens, symmetry will be restored. Maybe not tomorrow
but probably in my lifetime. I hope.</p></div></div>
