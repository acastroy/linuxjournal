    Version 3.0 of the Qt toolkit promises to make GUI
    programming even easier. In the previous issue we created
    the GUI of a tiny text editor using the Qt Designer. This
    time we add missing functionality and translate the
    application into lanugages other than English.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1584580.0x167c558"></a></h2></div></div><p>In Part I of this series
[<i  >LJ</i>, September 2002] we created the GUI of a
tiny text editor using Qt Designer. Now, we add missing
functionality and translate the application into other languages by
using our favourite editor along with make and the g++ C++
compiler, and use Qt Linguist as an attractive working environment
during translation.
</p><p>We use the new qmake utility to write the Makefile for our Qt
application; qmake outdates tmake, a Perl tool widely used with
older Qt versions.</p><p>Our editor GUI already closes windows and the entire
application, but we still lack a user dialog that asks whether the
old data should be saved or discarded or whether the user wants to
stay with the old file. The New, Save and Save As actions do
nothing right now, but everything else was completed. The GUI
already supports copy, cut and paste, undo and redo. It can switch
font characteristics to italic, bold, underlined and any
combination of the three. These QTextEdit actions already can be
tested in the Qt Designer preview. The About entry in the Help menu
will be fully functional as soon as we compile the GUI into a C++
program.</p><p>We could write the remaining functions using Qt Designer's
built-in code editor. As there are no means to compile the project
within the Designer, however, using one's favourite text editor is
faster.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1584580.0x167c7c0"></a>Rolling out a Project</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have the user interface ready in a ui file for
the interface description, and a ui.h file containing the code
already written, it's time to implement the remaining
functionality. First we have to convert the XML to C++ with the
User Interface Compiler, uic, but using qmake we don't need to
worry about this detail. Let's feed it the project file generated
by the Designer:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
qmake -o Makefile lj-article.pro
</pre><p>A Makefile is created with a subdirectory named .ui that is
supposed to store the C++ code generated from the ljeditor.ui and
ljeditor.ui.h files. If this fails and you are asked to set the
QMAKEPATH, set this variable to the mkspecs subdirectory of your Qt
installation, which describes your operating system and compiler.
For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
QMAKEPATH=$QTDIR/mkspecs/linux-g++
export QMAKEPATH
</pre>


Depending on where you have installed Qt, make sure that the search
path contains the $QTDIR/bin directory of the used Qt version.
</p><p>To generate the C++ files simply type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make .ui/ljeditor.h
make .ui/ljeditor.cpp
</pre><p>If problems arise, check the environment variables QTDIR,
PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH. The first one should point to the
directory parenting the Qt 3.0 subdirectories lib and include. The
directories where uic, qmake and designer live should be included
in the path, and $QTDIR/lib should be added to the linker path.
</p><p>Editing the two generated files means the changes are lost
when the ui file is moved to the Designer and a new conversion
round becomes necessary. So, we derive a subclass from ljeditor and
add our changes to it instead of to ljeditor.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>uic</b></span> offers the command-line
switches -subdecl classname and -subimpl classname to build the
appropriate code skeletons. With</p><pre     class="programlisting">
uic -o editor.h -subdecl Editor .ui/ljeditor.h \
ljeditor.ui

</pre><p>we obtain editor.h, the header file for the new Editor
subclass. On the other hand (mind the argument header file), the
following line creates the implementation skeleton in editor.cpp:
<pre     class="programlisting">
uic -o editor.cpp -subimpl Editor editor.h \
ljeditor.ui
</pre>


These new files need to be added to the project file by adding two
lines:
<pre     class="programlisting">
HEADERS += editor.h
SOURCES += editor.cpp
</pre>


to lj-article.pro. Or you could start Qt Designer, open the project
file and add them via Project&reg;Add File. Remember to set the
File type to C++ Files, otherwise the file dialog won't find them).
If you like the text editor included in the Designer, you even
might edit them there.
</p><p>The subclass code generated by uic always includes skeletons
for all functions present in the parent class. Thus, it's a good
idea to delete the declarations and function skeletons of all
functions that you don't plan to re-implement in the subclass.
Remove the lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void fileExit();
void helpAbout();
void fileClose();
</pre><p>from editor.h and the relevant code skeletons from
editor.cpp, which look like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
void Editor::fileExit()
{
   qWarning( "Editor::fileExit() "
             "not yet implemented!" );
}
</pre>


For a complete program we still need a main() function. We may
write it by hand, but Qt Designer can help you a little. Choose
File&reg;New&reg;C++ Main-File (main.cpp) from the menu and the
subsequent dialog.
</p><p>The dialog shown in Figure 1 asks us to name the main file
(we choose ljedit.cpp) and the main widget. Designer does not
provide the Editor subclass here; thus we don't really have a
choice and choose ljeditor.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4722f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Configuring the main File
</p></div></div><p>Choosing this name means we have to correct the generated
code. Instead of ljeditor.h, we include editor.h, and instead of
creating a new object of the ljeditor class, we need an Editor one.
Now our ljedit.cpp should look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#include &lt;qapplication.h&gt;
#include "editor.h"
int main( int argc, char ** argv )
{
    QApplication a( argc, argv );
    Editor *w = new Editor;
    w-&gt;show();
    a.connect( &amp;a, SIGNAL( lastWindowClosed() ),
               &amp;a, SLOT( quit() ) );
    return a.exec();
}
</pre><p>As in every usual Qt main(), we create a QApplication object,
hand it possible command-line arguments (argv) and create the
Editor widget w. Then we show it to the world and enter the
application loop with a.exec().
</p><p>You may notice that a <b  >a.setMainWidget( w
);</b> line is missing that defines the main widget of the
application (we'll explain this later). However, without a main
widget, the application will not quit when the last window is
closed. So, we have to connect the application object's signal,
lastWindowClosed(), to its quit() slot.</p><p><b  >make</b> and a subsequent ./lj-article in the
project directory should result in a running, yet not fully
functional text editor. If you wish to call the binary by something
other than the project file's base name, add the line
<b  >TARGET = ljedit</b> to lj-article.pro.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1584580.0x167d370"></a>Time for Coding</h2></div></div><p>Basically, we won't do much more than substitute the
qWarning()'s saying &ldquo;not yet implemented&rdquo; in editor.cpp with
reasonable functionality, using our favourite text editor. If the
Designer's built-in code editor suits your needs, you don't have to
worry about subclassing, but compiling and debugging becomes more
painful, so we decided against it.</p><p>Listing 1 shows all of editor.h; Listing 2 is an excerpt from
editor.cpp. All listings are available from the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site
[<a href="../listings/102/4722.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue102/4722.tgz</a>].</p><p><a href="4722l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. editor.h</a></p><p><a href="4722l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. editor.cpp</a></p><p>Apart from the four slots left to implement, we re-implement
the closeEvent(), a function that's called when a widget is closed,
because we want the user to confirm the closing of an editor window
so as not to unexpectedly lose data. For clarity reasons, the
relevant user dialog is implemented in a separate function,
saveAndContinue().</p><p>Also, we introduce two class variables: fileName, to store
the filename of the currently edited file, and editField, to hold a
copy of the QTextEdit widget. Providing these variables with
initial values is the only task for the Editor constructor.</p><p>Another easy task is to implement the fileNew() slot. It
creates a new Editor window and shows it. This is why we don't make
the first editor window the application's main widget: if we did,
closing the first editor window would make all other windows close
too.</p><p>But what happens when the user closes a window or the entire
application? The re-implemented closeEvent() calls
saveAndContinue() with one argument: the message that should be
displayed to users when they decide to abort the closing process
(line 159). As with all text strings, we embrace it with tr() to
make localization possible. If saveAndContinue() returns a &ldquo;yes,
continue&rdquo;, the close event is accepted; otherwise the event is
dismissed.</p><p>If the user has chosen a filename for the editor content or
entered some text into the QTextEdit widget, it is safe to assume
that he or she might want to keep the work. In this case
saveAndContinue() brings up a message box using the filename as the
window caption that asks: Save filename? Three reply buttons are
provided: Yes, No and Cancel. The slightly copious notation with
the %1 placeholder for the content of fileName is important for
internationalization: other languages order words differently, and
the translator must have a chance to place the filename elsewhere,
say the beginning of the phrase.</p><p>If the Yes button was pressed (line 181) the editor content
is saved under the given name. If no filename has been set,
fileSaveAs() asks for a filename before storing. If the answer is
No, all unsaved changes are lost. The user is informed about this
in the status bar for 2,000 milliseconds (line 187). The Cancel
button shows the abort message in the status bar, and
saveAndContinue() returns a &ldquo;no, don't continue&rdquo; (line 194). In
the case where no filename and no editor content are present, no
message box appears. The return value then is a TRUE, &ldquo;do continue
anyway&rdquo; (line 201).</p><p>saveAndContinue also is called from the fileOpen() slot. If
the editor window contains text or if a filename was defined
previously, the user has the chance to save it prior to opening
another file in this window.</p><p>Whether saved or not, clearing the editor content and
resetting the window caption makes the user aware that the old
editor content is gone. With the help of a file dialog presenting
the content of the current (.) directory, the user gets the chance
to choose a new file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1584580.0x167d9a0"></a>All over the World</h2></div></div><p>With the tr() functions around each text string, we're able
to release the program in other languages. All this step requires
are some modifications of the main() function and the actual
translation. The latter is easily accomplished using Qt Linguist
(Figure 2). But before you or another translator gets started, we
have to obtain the text strings to be translated.</p><p>First we add another variable, TRANSLATIONS, to the *.pro
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
TRANSLATIONS = ljedit_de.ts \
               ljedit_no.ts
</pre><p>This example states that the application is bound for
translation into German (ljedit_de.ts) and Norwegian
(ljedit_no.ts). It is quite important that the base name of the
file containing the translation ends with a locale abbreviation
like &ldquo;de&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.
</p><p>Once you have selected the desired translation language(s)
for the application, typing <b  >lupdate
<i><tt>lj-article</tt></i>.pro</b> creates two XML
files that can be loaded into linguist. The translator now
translates each string and switches the yellow question mark to a
green tick when completed. The task has been fulfilled as soon as
the Scope window (on the left-hand side of Figure 2) reveals that
all of the classes have been translated fully.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4722f2.large.jpg"><img src="4722f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Translator's Friend: Qt
Linguist</p></div></div>
</p><p>A professional translator will compile phrase books of common
phrase-translation pairs before actually starting with the
translation of a program. As Linguist currently doesn't let users
copy translated strings from a program directly into phrase books,
the effort of compiling a phrase book is too high for those who do
not translate frequently. This is a pity because phrase books
support consistent usage of phrases within an application or even
throughout an entire range of programs. However, even without
phrase books, Linguist offers quality control switches.
Validation&reg;Accelerators&mdash;if on&mdash;ensures that accelerator keys
(marked with an &amp;) are not forgotten under translation.
Validation&reg;Ending Punctuation, on the other hand, checks
whether the translated string ends with the same punctuation mark
as the original.</p><p>When the last translated phrase is saved, File&reg;Release...
compiles the translations into a *.qm binary file that can be used
by the program. To release an entire set of translated *.ts files,
<b  >lrelease
<i><tt>lj-article</tt></i>.pro</b> can be used
instead. If the code is changed afterward, a fresh
<b  >lupdate</b> run integrates the relevant changes with
the *.ts files listed in the project file, and
<b  >lrelease</b> updates the binary version.</p><p>Listing 3 shows the internationalized main(). New is the
inclusion of qtranslator.h and qtextcodec.h. Depending on the
locale used (as defined by the environment variable LANG), the base
name of the translation file is compiled (line 13). If LANG is set
to, for example, de or de_DE, the application looks for a file
named ljedit_de or ljedit_de.qm in /local/lib. If it can't be found
there, the original language version is used. Unfortunately, there
is no simple way to search multiple directories and/or avoid
hard-coded directory names.</p><p><a href="4722l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. ljedit.cpp
(Internationalized Version)</a></p><p>If a translation file is found, the QTranslator object loads
it, and it is installed to serve the application (line 15). A
German version of ljedit is shown in Figure 3.</p><p>
