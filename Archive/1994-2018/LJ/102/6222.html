[<a href="../092/5476.html" target="_self">see &ldquo;syslog Configuration&rdquo;</a> in
the December 2001 issue of <i  >LJ</i>] I mentioned
&ldquo;stealth logging&rdquo;--by running your central log server without an
IP address, you can hide your central log server from intruders.
But log servers aren't the only type of system that can benefit
from a little stealth. Network sniffers and network intrusion
detection systems (NIDSes) probes can also function perfectly well
without IP addresses, making them less vulnerable to network
attacks than the systems they protect.
</p><p>This month I demonstrate three ways to use the versatile and
powerful Snort&mdash;as a stealth sniffer, a stealth NIDS probe and a
stealth logger&mdash;on a network interface with no IP address. If
you're already familiar with Snort, I hope you'll see how easily it
can be used stealthfully. If you're new to Snort, this article may
be a useful crash course for you. All Snort commands and
configurations in this article work equally well on interfaces with
and without IP addresses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ca580.0x18c25b0"></a>Why Be Stealthful?</h2></div></div><p>Running internet-connected computers is risky. Anytime you
provide services, there's a chance that a hostile user might hijack
the system through an application vulnerability or simply overwhelm
the system with a denial-of-service attack that sends more traffic
to your system than it can handle. For web servers, FTP servers and
other systems that end users interact with, this risk never can be
eliminated&mdash;it only can be minimized or contained.</p><p>Network probes and log servers are unique, however, because
their roles are fundamentally passive; they receive data but don't
need to send any. Taking advantage of their passivity by making
them inaccessible from the networks they protect makes a lot of
sense.</p><p>The trade-off is systems without IP addresses must be
administered only from the console, or must have another network
interface with an IP address. If a system has multiple interfaces,
two precautions are vital. First, IP forwarding must be disabled,
and second, the interface with an IP address must be connected to a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>different</em></span> network from the sniffing/logging
interface. It could, for example, be connected to a dedicated
&ldquo;admin&rdquo; network consisting only of NIDS probes, loggers and
administrative workstations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ca580.0x18c27c0"></a>Physical and System-Level Setup</h2></div></div><p>Physically installing a network interface card (NIC) is easy.
Provided that your NIC is supported by your kernel, Linux should
automatically detect the NIC and load the appropriate kernel
module(s).</p><p>However, different distributions handle NIC initialization in
different ways. For example, after adding a second NIC to my Red
Hat stealth sniffer, I had to create a new file,
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1, with the following
contents:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DEVICE=eth1
USERCTL=no
ONBOOT=yes
BOOTPROTO=
BROADCAST=
NETWORK=
NETMASK=
IPADDR=
</pre><p>Although Red Hat's Kudzu tool automatically detected the new
interface, its network-configuration script returned an error when
I declined to give an IP address. By creating my own
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1 file, I got Red Hat to
activate the new interface without actually giving it an IP
address. On different distributions other steps may be required.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ca580.0x18c29d0"></a>Stealth Sniffing</h2></div></div><p>Once you've installed and activated your stealth NIC and
connected it to the network you wish to monitor, it's time to try
some stealth sniffing. For the remainder of the article I'll assume
you've already installed Snort. Most Linux distributions contain
their own Snort packages, and the latest version is available at
<a href="http://www.snort.org" target="_self">www.snort.org</a>. If you're
going to use Snort as a NIDS, it's especially important to be
running a recent version of Snort.</p><p>The Snort command for &ldquo;sniffer mode&rdquo; is simply:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
snort -dvi eth1
</pre><p>The -d option tells Snort to decode application data. The -v
option tells it to print packets to the console, and the -i option
lets you specify the interface to sniff. To tell Snort to skip the
hexadecimal data and show only ASCII, use the -C option (Listing
1).
</p><p><a href="6222l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. A Packet Dump
without Hexadecimal Data</a></p><p>Snort's sniffing functionality works perfectly well on an
interface without an IP address.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ca580.0x18c2d40"></a>Stealthful Intrusion Detection</h2></div></div><p>Intrusion detection is a big topic, and Snort's intrusion
detection abilities are diverse and powerful. Before we go any
further, then, I want to stress that I'm only scratching the
surface: running Snort with a near-default configuration file,
using only the included rules, is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the most
effective way to use Snort as a NIDS. I'm describing this method
here because it's a simple and fast way to get started with
NIDS.</p><p>To start using Snort in NIDS mode, all you need to do is edit
the file /etc/snort/snort.conf and start Snort in d&aelig;mon mode.
Then, periodically update the Snort rules referenced in snort.conf
as new attack signatures become available. Let's briefly discuss
each of these steps.</p><p>Although you can specify any configuration file you like with
Snort's -c startup option, most people use /etc/snort/snort.conf.
For the remainder of this article I'll assume that's your choice
too. Listing 2 shows a truncated but syntactically complete Snort
configuration file.</p><p><a href="6222l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. A Sample snort.conf
File</a></p><p>As you can see, a Snort configuration consists of global
options, variable declarations, &ldquo;preprocessor&rdquo; statements,
&ldquo;output&rdquo; statements and Snort rules. Global options (&ldquo;config&rdquo;
statements) provide a handy means of setting most of the options
that also can be passed to Snort via startup flags, which saves
typing.</p><p>Variables are used by Snort rules to make attack detection
more accurate. For example, by specifying the IP address of your
local name servers via the DNS_SERVERS variable, Snort will
disregard certain types of packets sent by your DNS servers that,
in other circumstances, might look like attacks.</p><p>Preprocessor statements are used to configure preprocessor
modules, which are Snort components that act on or alter packets
prior to matching them against rules. For example, the preprocessor
frag2 re-assembles fragmented packets, and it also watches out for
IP-fragment-based attacks and other fragment-related
anomalies.</p><p>Output statements configure postprocessor modules, which
provide different means of logging or otherwise archiving Snort
alerts and observed packets. For example, the database
postprocessor can be used to log packets to a MySQL database for
later correlation and analysis by tools such as ACID
(<a href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~rdanyliw/snort/snortacid.html" target="_self">www.andrew.cmu.edu/~rdanyliw/snort/snortacid.html</a>).</p><p>Finally, rules can be listed either directly, as with Listing
2's &ldquo;Cisco Catalyst Remote Access&rdquo; alert, or in included text
files, as with the remainder of Listing 2. The latter method makes
it easy to use the rule files maintained by the Snort team at
<a href="http://www.snort.org/dl/signatures/snortrules.tar.gz" target="_self">www.snort.org/dl/signatures/snortrules.tar.gz</a>
(updated every 30 minutes!) or the ArachNID rules at
<a href="http://www.whitehats.com/ids" target="_self">www.whitehats.com/ids</a>.</p><p>To start Snort in NIDS mode using this configuration file,
execute this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
snort -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -D -i eth1
</pre><p>Remember that in earlier examples we set up eth1 as our
stealth interface.
</p><p>By default, Snort will log alerts to /var/log/snort/alert and
port-scanning activity to /var/log/snort/portscan.log. Packets
referenced in alerts will be logged to subdirectories of
/var/log/snort, as described in Listing 3.</p><p>A dedicated NIDS probe will need to start Snort in its boot
routine. The official Snort RPM automatically installs the startup
script /etc/init.d/snortd. Once you've configured Snort to your
satisfaction, activate this script for the desired runlevels with
the <b  >chkconfig</b> command. You may need to write
your own startup script if you installed Snort from source.</p><p>Running Snort in NIDS mode deserves its own article, even a
whole <span   class="emphasis"><em>series</em></span> of articles, but this is enough
to illustrate that Snort can be used with a non-IP-addressed
interface and to show how to get started with NIDS mode.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ca580.0x18c3580"></a>Stealthful Logging</h2></div></div><p>Now it's time to combine the previous two techniques in a
third one: stealth logging. Normally, a central log server runs
syslog or syslog-ng. And indeed, it's possible to capture log
packets via a non-IP-addressed interface with Snort and pass them
to syslog or syslog-ng. However, it's a lot simpler to let Snort
write the packets to a log file itself. The method I'm about to
describe uses Snort, tail and awk instead of a traditional logger
(on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>central</em></span> logserver, that is; on hosts
that <span   class="emphasis"><em>send</em></span> logs you'll still need to configure
syslog or syslog-ng as described below).</p><p>Suppose you have a LAN segment with several servers whose log
messages you'd like sent to a single log server. Suppose further
that you're far less concerned with the confidentiality of these
log messages than with their integrity. You don't care if anybody
eavesdrops the messages, but you don't want the messages tampered
with once they've been received by the central log server. Your log
server, therefore, is connected to the LAN via a non-IP-addressed
interface and will sniff log packets sent to a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>bogus</em></span> IP address on the LAN.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ca580.0x18c37e8"></a>Configuring Your Hosts to Send Logs to the
Stealth Logger</h2></div></div><p>On each server from which you wish to send logs, you'll need
to do two things. The first step is to configure each sender's
system logger to send its messages to the bogus IP. By &ldquo;bogus&rdquo;, I
only mean that no host actually has that IP address; it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> be valid for the LAN in question. Suppose
our example LAN's network address is 192.168.1.0/24 and our bogus
logger-host address is 192.168.1.111. Servers on the LAN that use
standard syslog will each need a line like this in
/etc/syslog.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*.info                  @192.168.1.111
</pre><p>On servers that use syslog-ng, you'll need several lines in
/etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf, like these:
<pre     class="programlisting">
destination d_loghost { udp(ip(192.168.1.111)
port(514)); };
filter f_info { level(info); };
log { filter(f_info); destination(d_loghost); };
</pre>


In either case you may wish to specify different criteria from
simply saying &ldquo;all messages whose severity is 'info' or higher&rdquo;,
as shown in the above two examples.
</p><p>Besides the appropriate lines in its logger's configuration
file, each log sender will also need a static ARP entry for the
bogus IP address. If your LAN consists of a hub or a series of
&ldquo;cascaded&rdquo; hubs, this ARP address also can be bogus. If your LAN
is switched, you'll instead need to specify the real MAC address
(hardware address) of the log server. The command to add a static
ARP entry on our example log-sending servers is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
arp -s 192.168.1.111 00:04:C2:56:54:58
</pre><p>where 192.168.1.111 is our bogus log-host IP, and
00:04:C2:56:54:58 is either a bogus MAC address or the real MAC
address of our stealth logger's non-IP-addressed interface.
</p><p>Now each server on our protected LAN is configured to send
its logs to 192.168.1.111, and in the case of a switched LAN,
they'll be sent to the stealth logger's switch port. Now all we
need to do is configure the stealth logger itself.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ca580.0x18c3bb0"></a>Configuring Snort on the Stealth Logger</h2></div></div><p>As with intrusion-detection mode, we can configure Snort as a
stealth logger by editing only one file, /etc/snort/snort.conf.
Listing 3 shows my Red Hat stealth logger's snort.conf file. Let's
dissect it.</p><p><a href="6222l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. /etc/snort/snort.conf/
for a Stealth Logger</a></p><p>First, we have a single variable declaration: EXTERNAL_NET
any. None of the other variables we set for NIDS mode are necessary
here. Next, we've got a few config statements: dump_payload is
equivalent to the command-line option -d; dump_chars_only is
equivalent to -C; and logdir specifies the root directory for Snort
logs (and is equivalent to -l).</p><p>Continuing down Listing 3, we next see one preprocessor
statement: we're invoking the frag2 preprocessor with default
settings. Large log packets may be fragmented, and if so, frag2
will re-assemble them for us.</p><p>Finally, the payoff: a single custom Snort rule. Writing
Snort rules is no more complicated than writing iptables or
ipchains rules, requiring only a basic understanding of how TCP/IP
protocols and applications behave. The &ldquo;Snort Users' Manual&rdquo; at
<a href="http://www.snort.org/docs/writing_rules" target="_self">www.snort.org/docs/writing_rules</a>
documents this clearly and comprehensively. Let's walk through the
Snort rule in Listing 3:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
log udp 192.168.1.20/32 any -&gt;
192.168.1.111/32 514 (logto:
"logged-packets";)
</pre><p>The rule begins with the rule action log. In this case, we're
using Snort as a packet logger. So rather than writing a message to
/var/log/snort/alert, we want Snort to log any packets that match
the rule without writing an alert.
</p><p>Next comes the rule's matching protocol, udp.
<span   class="bold"><b>syslog</b></span> messages usually are sent
via UDP.</p><p>After the rule's protocol comes its source IP, expressed in
CIDR notation. 192.168.1.20 is the IP address of the host sending
log packets, so we want to match packets sent by that host. /32 is
CIDR shorthand for &ldquo;parse all 32 address bits&rdquo;, which indicates
this is a single host address rather than a range of addresses. To
match packets from all hosts on the example LAN, we instead could
specify a source IP of 192.168.1.0/24.</p><p>The source port follows the source IP, in this case &ldquo;any&rdquo;
source port. &ldquo;Any&rdquo; is a common source-port designator in Snort
rules, because with only a few exceptions, TCP/IP client
applications send packets from arbitrary, high-numbered ports. In
the middle of the rule is its direction operator (-&gt;), which
signifies that the IP and port to the left of it pertain to the
packet's source, and those to the right pertain to its destination.
The other allowed direction operator is &lt;&gt;, which indicates
that the source and destination IP/port pairs are interchangeable.
In other words, Snort should match packets going in either
direction between the specified IP addresses on the specified
ports.</p><p>To the right of the direction operator come the rule's
destination IP and destination port designators, 192.168.1.111/32
and 514, respectively. 192.168.1.111 is the bogus IP address to
which our servers log, on UDP port 514.</p><p>Finally, the rule's options are listed between parentheses,
delimited by semicolons if there are multiple options. In this case
there's only one, logto: &ldquo;logged-packets&rdquo;. The logto option lets us
specify a log file to which to write matched packets, in this case
/var/log/snort/logged-packets (earlier we set the configuration
option logdir to /var/log/snort).</p><p>Without the logto: option, Snort will log packets in a new
subdirectory of the root log directory, one subdirectory per
matched source-IP address. For a stealth logger's purposes, though,
it's much better to use the logto: option to specify a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span> log file to which matched packets for
each rule are logged. This allows you to group packets by rule
rather than by transaction.</p><p>Whew, it took me longer to explain that single rule than it
took me to explain the rest of our stealth logger's snort.conf
file. But the rule is the important part. If you have additional
servers sending log messages, you'll probably want a separate rule
for each so their messages are logged to separate files.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ca580.0x1cbc4e0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Snort is a versatile and powerful tool for sniffing,
intrusion detection and packet logging. Configuring it to run
stealthily in sniffing mode or NIDS mode is easy; incorporating it
into a stealth-logging solution is only slightly less so. Good luck
with your logging and NIDS endeavors, stealthful or not!</p><p><a href="6222s1.html" target="_self">LAN Segments, Hubs and
