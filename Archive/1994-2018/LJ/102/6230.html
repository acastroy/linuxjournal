political action regarding US threats to the very existence of
Internet radio. The Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel (CARP),
created by the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
would wipe out US internet radio through high, retroactive,
payments that do not apply to ordinary radio. Doc Searls has been
covering these developments in a series of articles on our web
site. If you haven't been keeping up, read &ldquo;Hollywood Steps Up Its
Assault on the Net While Webcasting Death March Claims KPIG&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6246.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6246</a>)
and &ldquo;Why Are So Many Internet Radio Stations Still on the Air?&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6218.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/6218</a>).
</p><p>In addition, the US Department of Commerce's second Digital
Rights Management (DRM) workshop was held in Washington, DC, and
everyone was represented on the panel except the general public.
Fortunately, Linux users crashed this little party that the
government threw for RIAA, MPAA and other Hollywood-interest
groups. Read about it in &ldquo;DRM Is Theft: New Yorkers for Fair Use
Go to Washington&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6243.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/6243</a>)
contributed by New York Linux Scene (NYLXS) founder Ruben
Safir.</p><p>We are seeing more and more clearly that Hollywood has the
money and the desire to turn the Internet into a super-regulated,
privacy-invading, content-management system. As Doc and others keep
asking, &ldquo;So what are we going to do about it?&rdquo; While the general
public is asleep at the wheel on this one (they'll have a rude
awakening before too long), some Linux users are learning how to
get politicians' ears. Ruben Safir has more to say about that in
&ldquo;Politics Is Local, So Get Political Locally&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6250.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/6250</a>). At
the local level, you can knock on doors and get meetings with your
Representative in Congress. Nobody's going to do it for you.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6230f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

write software without paying some 21st-century stamp tax, Greg
Ward's article on Quixote
(<a href="../000/6178.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6178</a>)
describes a web application framework &ldquo;written by and for Python
programmers&rdquo;. Quixote has its own templating language based on
Python code &ldquo;to generate long text strings such as HTML
documents&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;embedding Python code in an HTML-like
template language&rdquo;. This definitely is an approach designed for
web programmers rather than designers used to an HTML
editor.</p><p>We get a lot of submissions for <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and due to space limitations in print, many
helpful tutorials, reviews and news items appear on the web site
instead. Articles are available on the site dating back to 1994,
and new ones are posted every day.</p></div></div>
