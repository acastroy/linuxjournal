    When you visit a HyperNews article and view a response, you can
    (depending on local access settings) add your own response to
    it, start a new thread, or navigate among the threads and
    responses in various ways.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c8580.0x15c0500"></a></h2></div></div><p>For all the excitement over the Web&mdash;some
justified, some exaggerated&mdash;a case could still be made for pinning
the medal on Usenet as the most important and really original
Internet contribution to communication. Fortunately, we have never
had to choose between them&mdash;and now, with the availability of
Daniel LaLiberte's HyperNews package, we can have the best of the
functionality of both in one place.
</p><p>A HyperNews &ldquo;base article&rdquo; is a WWW page, with a
newsgroup-like segment at the end (see
<a href="1281f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1</a>--in fact, look at it more
than once as you read). The HyperNews segment is organized by
thread, with cascaded response subject lines. The responses,
moreover, may be entered as plain text, &ldquo;smart text&rdquo; (does some
formatting for you), a URL, or HTML. Thus the body of any response
can incorporate another web page, operate as a mini-web page of its
own, or simply consist of a Usenet-like typed statement.</p><p>When you visit a HyperNews article and view a response, you
can (depending on local access settings) add your own response to
it, start a new thread, or navigate among the threads and responses
in various ways. Any response you add can&mdash;in fact, must&mdash;be
previewed before it is finally posted, so you have a chance to see
what your response will look like and, if you included hyperlinks,
whether you got them right.</p><p>Retrieving a HyperNews base article is just like retrieving
any other web page. Initial access generally goes through the
&ldquo;get&rdquo; script, so a typical URL looks like
<a href="http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HyperNews/get/hypernews.html" target="_self">union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HyperNews/get/hypernews.html</a>.</p><p>This sample URL actually points to the HyperNews home page,
which is not only indispensable if you are interested in running
the package, but also provides a pretty spectacular example of
HyperNews in action. As you will see if you visit, it is possible
to have any number of base articles at a given site&mdash;after all,
they are web pages. This home page also offers a glimpse of the
range of roles that a HyperNews extension can play in the life of a
web page. The response section can shoulder most of the substance
of the page (as in the &ldquo;Bugs&rdquo; article, where much of the
information sought is likely to reside in the response section); or
function as a relatively low-key guestbook-style scratchpad; or
anything in between.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c8580.0x15c0818"></a>Anatomy of a Base Article</h2></div></div><p>What you see when you visit a HyperNews article is basically
a web page with a response outline&mdash;possibly a very long one&mdash;at
the bottom. Behind the scenes, the HyperNews base article is a
virtual home page, constructed on demand by the suite of Perl
scripts which make up the HyperNews distribution. It consists of
the following four sections, each of which is configurable in
various ways, shown in <a href="1281f2.html" target="_self">Figure
2</a>.</p><p>The separation of the base article into these several logical
components gives you quite a bit of control over its look and feel.
Each base article has an associated .html.urc file in which header,
footer, and body URLs are specified. This makes for relatively easy
maintenance and testing&mdash;perhaps no easier than any other
non-trivial web installation, but it's nice that the pieces are
separate and that the scripts do the bulk of the work in making
sense of them.</p><p>The body, in most cases, contains whatever the page is really
&ldquo;about&rdquo;. There's no point giving examples here&mdash;it's a web page,
with everything that implies. During the process of creating a base
article, you can enter the body by hand in HTML, plain text, or
&ldquo;smart text&rdquo;; or you can specify a URL. If you enter text or
HTML, HyperNews creates a name-body.html file for you, which you
can later edit. If you specify a single URL for the body, your base
article will consist of a retrieval of that URL, positioned among
the other elements of the HyperNews page as sketched out in Figure
2.</p><p>The header and footer can be specified in the
installation-wide configuration file hnrc, and/or separately for
one or more base articles in the relevant .html.urc file(s).
Installation-wide header and footer specifications in hnrc may
consist of text, URL, or HTML. (I'd advise against putting
full-blown HTML in the header specification, though&mdash;it's unlikely
to be necessary, and it doesn't always mesh with the icons it ends
up sharing space with.) Per-article header and footer
specifications consist of URLs whose sources will be retrieved and
placed, respectively, above the body and below the responses. The
header and/or footer can also be left empty.</p><p>Both header and footer are propagated to the responses; that
is, every response to an article (and responses to responses, etc.)
includes and displays their base article's header and footer. This
means that you should probably keep the size of the header and
footer down, and that they should be relevant to every response, or
at least unobtrusive (i.e., this is probably not the right place
for site-wide greeting messages).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c8580.0x15c0ad8"></a>Access and Security</h2></div></div><p>Disclaimer: I know enough to keep my systems as secure as I
feel they need to be, but I am not a security guru. If you install
HyperNews, you should familiarize yourself with all the available
information on security, and make sure that you are satisfied with
the robustness of your particular setup.</p><p>As a HyperNews administrator, you have control over who gets
to do what. The &ldquo;who&rdquo; here has three possible values:
administrator, member, and anyone. The &ldquo;what&rdquo; includes creating
new base articles; reading articles and responses; and adding,
deleting, and/or moving responses. You can pretty much mix and
match restriction among the access levels and the available
activities. For instance, you might want to grant unrestricted read
access to your article and responses, but limit response-adding to
members.</p><p>In all likelihood, you won't want anyone other than
administrators (that is, you) creating base articles&mdash;otherwise you
might wake up one morning to find that your machine has become an
outpost of the Barry Manilow fan club. When it comes to adding
responses, however, you might want to adopt a more open policy. The
one thing about completely open response-adding that worries me is
that it's possible to sign with someone else's name and e-mail
address. That person will get a confirmation notice by e-mail (if
that option is configured, which it is by default); but that may be
cold comfort if several hundred web surfers have already read an
illegitimately attributed posting. Requiring membership, on the
other hand, might be a deterrent to posting, at least for the
casual visitor, since it involves taking the time to fill out a
form.</p><p>I'll describe some further aspects of access and security in
the following section.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c8580.0x15c0ce8"></a>Installation and Setup</h2></div></div><p>The HyperNews distributions is a suite of Perl 5 CGI scripts.
I hit a bit of a snag here&mdash;I had to recompile Perl to get rid of
some weird and disabling behavior having to do with reading
configuration files. (It's still a mystery to me why it happened.)
Perl 5.001m seems to be the Perl release of choice for running
HyperNews.</p><p>I've installed HyperNews on two machines, using a pretty
by-the-book directory structure. The major step is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/lib/httpd/cgi-bin
cp HyperNews1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>version</em></span>.tgz .
tar -xvzf HyperNews1.&lt;version&gt;.tgz
</pre><p><b  ><i><tt>version</tt></i></b> will be
something like <b  >1.9B5.5</b>. This creates the
subdirectory HyperNews1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>version</em></span>. The
installation instructions recommend moving this directory to
HyperNews:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mv HyperNews1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>version</em></span> HyperNews
</pre><p>The HyperNews directory tree must be writeable by your httpd
server process during installation (though not thereafter, and in
fact it's recommended that you remove write permissions once the
package is installed). My server runs as user http, group www, so I
did:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chown -R http:www HyperNews
</pre><p>The HyperNews tree is where the scripts and the principal
configuration file live. HyperNews documents (base article and
response .html files, and the smaller configuration files that go
with them) go in a separate subdirectory, generally under
/usr/local/lib/httpd/htdocs (or equivalent). Therefore, you will do
something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd ../htdoc
mkdir hn
chown http:www hn
</pre><p>The next step in installation is to run the setup script,
which you do with your HTML browser:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
netscape http://myhost/HyperNews/.scripts/setup-form.pl
</pre><p>You can also run a command-line version of the setup script,
but you then have to edit the configuration file manually and run
it again. It's handy once you know what you're doing, but not very
installer-friendly the first time around.</p><p>The setup script asks you a number of questions. I won't
cover all of them, but a few things you should be aware of
are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Note that the default path is /usr/local/etc rather
than /usr/local/lib, so if your setup is like mine, you'll want to
change it.</p></li><li><p>Make sure to push the &ldquo;Rebuild Password and Group
Files&rdquo; button, unless you have some reason to want to create the
password files by hand.</p></li><li><p>The name you give for the administrator should be
an actual user or valid mail alias.</p></li></ul></div><p>When you submit the setup form, it creates (backing up if
needed) the main configuration file,
/usr/local/lib/httpd/HyperNews/hnrc. Once that file is in place,
you can change it manually. Some manual changes will take effect
immediately; others, specifically those concerning access and
membership, are really directives which tell the setup script to
create or delete certain access files and symbolic links. For those
changes to take effect, you have to run the setup script again;
otherwise, your configuration file and actual setup will not accord
with each other. (Updating the setup after manually changing hnrc
is a good time to run the quicker command-line version,
setup.pl.)</p><p>If you look at the HyperNews directory after running
setup-form.pl, you will see that there are a number of symbolic
links to various scripts, as well as two new subdirectories: Admin
and SECURED. The basic logic of the directory structure meshes with
the levels of access:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>All scripts are kept in HyperNews/.scripts.</p></li><li><p>Those that can be run by anyone have links in
HyperNews.</p></li><li><p>Those that can be run by members have links in
SECURED.</p></li><li><p>Those that can only be run by administrators have
links in Admin.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you change the who-gets-to-do-what settings in hnrc and
run the commandline setup.pl script, the relevant links will be
added or deleted.</p><p>The setup process also creates password and other
access-related files. These files are the gatekeepers for the
different access policies governing the script directories. This
per-directory security is handled through the server; for example,
.htaccess files for NCSA httpd. (And that brings us full circle to
my security disclaimer!)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c8580.0x15c1b00"></a>Customizing and Configuring</h2></div></div><p>There's a fair amount of configuring you can do by tweaking
the hnrc and/or the article-specific .html,urc files. More major
changes involve modifying (polite word for hacking) the Perl
scripts. I've done a bit of this. For instance, on one of the sites
where I've installed HyperNews, its main use will be to add
response functionality to the photographic portfolio of one of my
colleagues. We decided to eliminate the icons, present by default,
which indicate the response type&mdash;happy, angry, comment, question,
etc. These icons can be informative, but they also play a large
role in setting the tone of the page, and they won't be appropriate
for every HyperNews article. I've also thinned out the article
response form, since we're not planning to use membership and
wanted to incorporate our own wording for the form's
instructions.</p><p>As with all package-hacking, my assaults on the HyperNews
code will make it harder to upgrade to new versions at that
particular site. In fact, if I hadn't needed no-icon-ness right
away, I might very well have hung tight and seen whether it gets
incorporated into the package down the road. One of the great
things about the HyperNews home page (see URL, above) is that many
suggestions for change and improvement can be, and are, posted&mdash;and
Daniel LaLiberte, the author of HyperNews, is extremely receptive
and responsive. If you want to keep pace with HyperNews development
and releases, you can subscribe to the &ldquo;history&rdquo; page at
<a href="http://union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HyperNews/get/history.html" target="_self">union.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HyperNews/get/history.html</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c8580.0x15c1cb8"></a>Hyper-Remarks</h2></div></div><p>If a package like HyperNews could be described thoroughly in
an article of this length, it probably wouldn't be worth writing an
article about. There are plenty of features and possibilities, and
a few problems, that I haven't covered. If HyperNews intrigues you,
have a look at its home page, where you can read and post responses
to many base articles, including a couple of test and
guestbook-style ones. You'll find a lot of support from the
community of users, and you may very well also find one or more
uses for HyperNews in the context of your own web
development.</p></div></div>
