    A Linux computer can be a great server, not only for other
    Linux computers, but also for computers running other
    operating systems.  Peter gives an example of how to do this
    effectively.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c57580.0x1d4f4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux users consistently experiment,
finding uses for Linux far beyond what was even thought of five
years ago, when Linux itself was an experiment. For many users,
Linux has been far more than just another Unix clone; people want
something extra. The fact that Linux comes with networking built
in, including all the tools needed for connecting to the Internet,
makes it easy to pick Linux. The decision is not based on the pure
cost of Linux (negligible), the decision is based on the vast
amount Linux enables you to do with your PC.
</p><p>With a small investment (or perhaps just rearranging
hardware), you can have a complete home network with two computers,
even if only one of the computers runs Linux. Linux is also a good
network server for an office, and setting up a home network can
give you the experience you want to set up an office
network.</p><p>I didn't know Samba even existed until a friend showed me his
Linux drives on his WFWG 3.11 file manager. He showed me that he
could copy files back and forth just as if the Linux drives were
local. What he built was a small home LAN that consists of 2
computers. He wanted Samba installed on his main Linux server so
that his kids could run large programs on the server, without
having to take up limited hard drive space on their machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c57580.0x1d4f660"></a>Home Networks</h2></div></div><p>The home LAN installation was easy. The sources compiled
&ldquo;out of the box,&rdquo; and the default settings for the installation
were used:</p><p>/usr/local/samba/bin for binaries /usr/local/samba/lib for
configuration files /usr/local/samba/locks for samba locks
/usr/local/samba/man for samba manpages /usr/local/samba/var for
samba logs</p><p>Some Linux distributions come with Samba included, in which
case /usr/bin/, /var/samba/, and /usr/man are more likely places
for files, and the configuration file is usually kept in
/etc/smb.conf.</p><p>A basic configuration file (which defaults to
/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf) would consist of some basic entries
like <b  >[global]</b>, <b  >[printers]</b>,
and <b  >[homes]</b>. These specify global configuration
details that describe the environment, printers that are available
to clients, and user-specific home directories. You also create
your own sections for other directories which you wish to export to
other machines; see the <b  >[dos]</b> entry.</p><p>The general structure of a configuration file is like that of
a Windows .INI file, with sections of statements, and comments on
lines of their own that start with <b  >;</b>
characters.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

    public = yes
    writable = yes
    printable = no
    guest ok = yes
</pre><p>This configuration file allows Samba to serve a printer, a
shared directory, and home directories to network clients. There
must be a user named &ldquo;dos&rdquo; in the /etc/passwd file with no
password or a known password (and preferably /bin/false for a
shell, at least if there is no password) in order to have a &ldquo;world
shared&rdquo; directory, as shown in the <b  >[dos]</b>
section. Make sure the directory (in this case, /g/dos/) is owned
by this user &ldquo;dos&rdquo;.</p><p>If you want more explanation of this file, use <b  >man
smb.conf</b>.</p><p>At boot time, /usr/local/samba/lib/rc.samba starts the smbd
and nmbd daemons and has them wait for client connections. I run
them as daemons because I want some extra speed when I issue a
request from Samba.</p><p>A normal /usr/local/samba/lib/rc.samba file looks like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/samba/bin:$PATH
smbd -D -d1
nmbd -D -d1 -G <span   class="emphasis"><em>MY_WORKGROUP</em></span> \
 -n <span   class="emphasis"><em>THIS_MACHINE_NAME</em></span>
</pre><p>For both smbd (the file and printer server daemon) and nmbd
(the nameserver daemon), the <b  >-D</b> option says to
act as a daemon, working in the background. The
<b  >-d1</b> says to be a little more verbose than usual
with debugging messages; you will probably want to remove that once
your network is stable. The <b  >-G</b> option specifies
the netbios group (or lanmanager domain) that the computer should
be part of, and the <b  >-n</b> option can be used to
specify the name of the server on the network; if it is ommitted,
the server's normal hostname is used instead.</p><p>Some people disagree with running the Samba daemons as
daemons that are always running in the background, and prefer to
run them from inetd. This gives slower network response, but if
demand is light it reduces load on the server. The basic entry in
the /etc/inetd.conf file that comes with most distributions
is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
netbios-ssn stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/smbd smbd
netbios-ns  dgram  udp wait   root /usr/sbin/nmbd nmbd
</pre><p>You obviously have to provide the correct path to the
binaries to have them called via inetd.</p><p>On the client end, whether it is running WFWG 3.11 or Win95,
TCP/IP should be the default protocol. Each machine that has
services should show up in browse list. To connect to the
<b  >dos</b> shared service on the Samba server, you
could just use the basic <span   class="bold"><b>net</b></span>
command.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
c:\&gt; net use d: \\<span   class="emphasis"><em>MACHINE_NAME</em></span>\dos
password : <span   class="emphasis"><em>XXXXXX</em></span>
</pre><p>This would be sufficient for a small LAN that needs to share
a couple of home dir's and a printer. Make sure there is a valid
/etc/printcap file with proper entries for your printer; setting up
standard Linux printing is beyond the scope of this article. You
can do <b  >man printcap</b> for additional information
on the syntax this file requires, or read the Linux Printing HOWTO
which provides much more detailed information on printing
setup.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c57580.0x1d50370"></a>Office Networks</h2></div></div><p>What I have done with Samba at my office with about 20
computers on the LAN is more complex, but was not difficult to set
up and is very stable. If you are only going to set up a home
network, you can probably skip to the end of this article. If you
already administer a Windows 95 network, the Windows-specific
information presented here probably isn't new to you.</p><p>The Samba server is running Linux 1.2.13 (elf) with
samba-1.9.15p8 running on a 100MHZ Pentium with 16M ram, 4G SCSI
disk, and a 4G DAT.</p><p>The Samba clients are running WFWG 3.11 and Win95 on various
i486's with 8-16M of ram.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c57580.0x1d50528"></a>Win95 Features</h2></div></div><p>1. <span   class="bold"><b>Policies via the new Win95
Registry:</b></span> The registry is a new format that stores all
settings for users and system specific settings. There is a
Registry Editor that is needed to modify settings held within the
registry.</p><p>Policies are what a user can and can't do on the system and
what they can and can't do on the network. There is also a Policy
Editor to edit user and computer policies from.</p><p>2. <span   class="bold"><b>Remote logon
authentication:</b></span> where all Win95 client machines have
<span   class="bold"><b>all</b></span> logins to the network and
client machine be authenticated via Linux accounts.</p><p>This is where you would set up Samba to be the Domain
Controller.</p><p>1. Log in to the Win95 workstation with domain password if in
the smb.conf file you have <b  >user = security</b> and
you set up the Win95 registry to &ldquo;require domain authentication
before access to windows&rdquo;.</p><p>2. Samba has a function to read the /etc/passwd, look up the
uid and verify the password the user entered is correct.</p><p>3. If the password is correct, a result code is sent to the
Win95 machine for &ldquo;access granted&rdquo;.</p><p>4. If there is a <b  >[netlogon]</b> entry in the
smb.conf file, this directory is checked for a config.pol file that
the Win95 machine wants to read for the policies for the machine
and user. This must be set up in the Win95 setup in the registry
with &ldquo;remote update&rdquo; and &ldquo;automatic path&rdquo; in the Network
settings of the registry.</p><p>5. If you have <b  >logon script = %U.bat</b> in
the smb.conf file, the specified batch file will be executed on the
client for each user. (%U is replaced by the user name, so %U.bat
becomes username.bat&mdash;you can have a separate batch file for each
user). Make sure the logon scripts (which will be kept in the
directory specified in the <b  >[netlogon]</b> section)
use DOS-style line endings; a good way to ensure that is to use a
DOS editor on a DOS system to create the files.</p><p>The logon scripts are good if you use them. Only simple DOS
commands are required:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
net time /set /yes
</pre><p>would match up the time on the server to the workstation. It
is nice to have to maintain time on only one system. Having
policies stored on the server is another good idea. You can update
the policy file from another workstation and the next time a user
logs in, the policy file is read and the client registry is
updated&mdash;automatically!</p><p>All the necessary information about these Win95 specifics is
found in the Windows 95 Resource Kit. Other discussions of these
topics can be found at:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>comp.os.ms-windows.networking.tcp-ip for Windows

is still available with the client network software.</p><p>I have totally eliminated all network-related errors I was

Group Ltd. All disk accesses from the Samba server have dropped to
about half the time they used to take, and the system as a whole
performs much better than on the previous MS-DOS fileserver. The
