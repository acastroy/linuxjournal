    The KornShell, written by David Korn at Bell Telephone
    Laboratories, combined the best features of both of these
    shells, and added the ability to edit and reenter the current
    and previous commands using the same keystrokes as either the
    vi or the Emacs editor as the user desired.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x12c6a28"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Unix system was one of the first
systems that didn't make the command interpreter a part of the
operating system or a privileged task. It was written as an
ordinary user process with no special permissions or calls to
unadvertised functions. This has led to a succession of better and
better shells. The early generations of Unix came with a command
shell written by Ken Thompson, one of the inventors of the Unix
system. By the late 1970s, two vastly improved shells emerged. The
Bourne shell, created by Steve Bourne at Bell Telephone
Laboratories, was a big improvement as a language. The C shell,
created by Bill Joy at the University of California at Berkeley,
was a much improved command interpreter but a poor language.
</p><p>The KornShell, written by David Korn at Bell Telephone
Laboratories, combined the best features of both of these shells,
and added the ability to edit and reenter the current and previous
commands using the same keystrokes as either the vi or the Emacs
editor as the user desired. This shell became very popular, but its
distribution was restricted. As a result, several freely available
imitations such as pdksh and bash were created. An enhanced version
of C shell, tcsh, was created to provide visual editing to C shell
users.</p><p>While the Bourne shell provided a good basis for programming,
and this was improved upon by earlier versions of KornShell, it was
not adequate for general purpose scripting without combining it
with other languages such as the awk programming language. While in
most instances the two languages work well together, the
performance penalty of using two languages with separate processes
is often prohibitive. The Perl language was created to provide a
single language with the combined functionality of the shell and
awk. However, Perl has a syntax that many find difficult to
understand.</p><p>ksh93, the latest major revision of the KornShell language
provides an alternative to Tcl and Perl. As a programming language,
it has comparable speed and functionality to each of these
languages, yet is arguably the best interactive shell. It is a
superset of the POSIX 1003.2 shell standard. Like Tcl, it is
extensible and embeddable with a C language application programming
interface. In fact, two graphical shells have been created using
ksh93. One of these, dTksh, is a Motif-based language developed by
Novell. The other, Tksh, written by Jeff Korn at Princeton
University, uses the Tk library, and is briefly discussed
here.</p><p>The best way to describe the new features found in ksh93 is
to illustrate them through an example. We will create a shell
script named <span   class="bold"><b>lsc</b></span>, shown in Listing
1, to provide an <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> output with
subdirectory names printed in bold. We will need to maintain the
multi-column output associated with the standard ls.</p><p>The lsc script will produce the ls output for each directory
name provided as a command line argument. The default action is to
produce the ls output for the current directory. Several
modifications can be made to the lsc script for enhanced
performance. We leave them as an exercise for the reader. We
perform the following high level actions for each directory name to
be processed.</p><p>for each directory do</p><pre     class="programlisting">
load directory entries into array entries
load entries
calculate number of columns in multi-column output
calculate maximum number of rows
print the current directory name
determine output layout
add entries to row[] array
add entries to col[] array
calculate the column widths
display the output
</pre><p>done</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x12c6ea0"></a>Arrays</h2></div></div><p>ksh93 provides one-dimensional indexed and associative
arrays. An array element is referenced as
<b  ><i><tt>varName</tt></i>[<i><tt>subscript</tt></i>]</b>.
Indexed arrays use arithmetic expressions for subscripts. This
permits computation within the subscript expression. The statement
<b  >varName[3+8]</b> for example, references the 11th
element of the indexed array. (Arithmetic expressions are described
more fully below).</p><p>The elements of an indexed array can be initialized from a
list using the
<b  ><i><tt>varName</tt></i>=(....)</b>
command. This provides a convenient notation for initializing an
array to contain the names of files in a given directory. The
number of entries in the array describes the number of files found.
As an example, consider the following statement to initialize the
entries indexed array with the names of files found in the current
directory: <b  >entries=(*)</b></p><p>An associative array uses arbitrary strings for subscripts.
We could, for example, create a state tax associative array and
reference elements by the state name. This works even for space
separated tokens within the string, such as New Jersey.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typeset -A StateTax
StateTax[New Jersey]=0.06
print ${StateTax[New Jersey]}
</pre><p>Several special positional parameter expansions are provided
for array processing. Using
<b  >${<i><tt>varName</tt></i>[@]}</b> refers
to all elements of the array. The subscripts of an array can be
referenced with
<b  >${!<i><tt>varName</tt></i>[@]}</b>. The
notation
<b  >${#<i><tt>varName</tt></i>[@]}</b>
provides the number of elements within the array. Elements within a
numeric subscript range can be referenced using
<b  >${<i><tt>varName</tt></i>[@]:<i><tt>offset</tt></i>:<i><tt>length</tt></i>}</b>.
This special notation works with both indexed and associative
arrays.</p><p>Arrays are used throughout the example lsc script. We define
<b  >video</b> as an associative array with capability
names from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>terminfo</em></span> database as
subscripts. The definition of <b  >video</b> is provided
as a compound assignment for an associative array.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
video=(
   [bold]=$(tput bold)
   [reset]=$(tput reset)
   [reverse]=$(tput reverse)
)
</pre><p>Each element is assigned a value from the standard output of
a <span   class="bold"><b>tput</b></span> execution for the
capability name. For example, <b  >video[bold]</b> is the
terminfo sequence for bold lettering. Similarly,
<b  >video[reverse]</b> will provide reverse video
output.</p><p>Using the notation
<b  >$(<i><tt>command</tt></i>)</b> will cause
<b  ><i><tt>command</tt></i></b> to execute in
a subshell of the current ksh. In many instances, ksh will not
actually fork/exec a subshell when command is a built-in or a shell
function. (Built-in functions are described below).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x12c7bb0"></a>Expanded Name Space</h2></div></div><p>In ksh93 a variable is defined by a
<b  ><i><tt>name</tt></i>=<i><tt>value</tt></i></b>
pair. The variable name space is hierarchical with
<b  ><i><tt>.</tt></i></b> (dot) delimiters.
The expanded name space permits an aggregate definition for a
variable.</p><p>The lsc script will produce multi-column output. We visualize
the output as a table consisting of rows and columns. A common
definition for row and column is provided by the definition of a
compound variable named <b  >cell</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cell=(
  # maximum number of cells
  integer maximum=0
  # maximum width based on entries
  integer width=0
  # current index within the cell
  integer index=0
  # content of the cell
  typeset entries
)
</pre><p>This defines the variable <b  >cell</b>, with
aggregate members <b  >maximum</b>,
<b  >width</b>, <b  >index</b>, and
<b  >entries</b>. A reference of
<b  >${cell.index}</b> provides the value associated with
the index aggregate. Using the <b  >eval</b> command we
can create additional variables with the same aggregates. We can,
for example, define variables <b  >row</b> and
<b  >col</b> to have the same definition as cell:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
eval row="$cell"
eval col="$cell"
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x12bebd0"></a>Internationalization Support</h2></div></div><p>ksh93 provides support for internationalization.
Double-quoted strings preceded by a <b  >$</b> are
checked for message substitution. If the string appears in the
message catalog, then ksh93 will substitute the string with the
corresponding string from the message catalog. Otherwise, the
string is unchanged.</p><p>In the lsc example, we display an error message of
<b  >"not found"</b> for any command line arguments that
are not readable directories. The error message we provide is
defined with internationalization support (see line 33 of Listing
1). If the shell variable <b  >LANG</b> is defined to
some locale other than <b  >POSIX</b>, ksh will attempt
to replace the error message using internationalization support.
Otherwise, the message remains unchanged.</p><p>Executing <b  >ksh -D</b> on a shell script will
output all messages identified for internationalization. In the lsc
script, for example, <b  >ksh -D</b> will output the
following message.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
"${video[reverse]} not found ${video[reset]}"
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x12beff0"></a>KornShell Development Kit (KDK)</h2></div></div><p>ksh93 is extensible through the KornShell Development Kit
(KDK). You can write your own built-in functions in C and load them
into the current shell environment through the
<b  >builtin</b> command. This feature is available on
operating systems with the ability to load and link code into the
current process at run time.</p><p>A built-in command is executed without creating a separate
process. Instead, the command is invoked as a C function by ksh. If
this function has no side effects in the shell process, then the
behavior of this built-in is identical to that of the equivalent
stand-alone command. The primary difference in this case is
performance: the overhead of process creation is eliminated. For
commands of short duration, the effect can be dramatic. For
example, on SUN OS 4.1 wc on a small file of about 1000 bytes runs
about 50 times faster as a built-in command than as a separate
process.</p><p>In addition, built-in commands that have side effects on the
shell environment can be written. Using the API, available through
the KornShell Development Kit, you can extend the application
domain for shell programming. For example, an X-Windows extension
that makes heavy use of the shell variable namespace was added as a
group of built-in commands. The result is a windowing shell that
can be used to write X-Windows applications.</p><p>While there are definite advantages to adding built-in
commands, there are some disadvantages as well. Since the built-in
command and ksh share the same address space, a coding error in the
built-in program may affect the behavior of ksh, perhaps causing it
to core dump or hang. Debugging is also more complex since the
built-in's code is now a part of a larger entity. The isolation
provided by a separate process guarantees that all resources used
by the command will be freed when the command completes; this
guarantee does not apply to built-ins. Also, since the address
space of ksh will be larger, this may increase the time it takes
ksh to <b  >fork()</b> and <b  >exec()</b> a
non-builtin command [though not on more advanced operating systems
like Linux, which conserve memory and time by doing
&ldquo;copy-on-write&rdquo; when they fork&mdash;ED]. It makes no sense to add a
built-in command that takes a long time to run or that is run only
once, since the performance benefits will be negligible. Built-ins
that have side effects in the current shell environment have the
disadvantage of increasing the coupling between the built-in and
ksh making the overall system less modular and more
monolithic.</p><p>Despite these drawbacks, in many cases extending ksh by
adding built-in commands makes sense and allows reuse of the shell
scripting capability in an application-specific domain.</p><p>In the lsc example, we need to determine the maximum string
size within a list of strings. This is required to determine the
initial number of columns in the multi-column display. We will also
use this to determine the maximum width for a column of entries. A
typical shell implementation would be given as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(( max_stringSize = 0 ))
for fileName in *
do
if (( max_stringSize &lt; ${#fileName} ))
then
   (( max_stringSize = ${#fileName} ))
fi
done
</pre><p>(See <span   class="bold"><b>Arithmetic Expressions</b></span>,
below, for an explanation of <b  >((</b> and
<b  >))</b>.)</p><p>To improve performance, we can re-write this function in C.
In a simple example, the shell equivalent function required 0.58
seconds of CPU. The C built-in function provided 0.08 seconds of
CPU for the same task. The function name is preceded with &ldquo;b_&rdquo; to
indicate that it is a built-in function. When compiled, the
strlenList.o object is then archived into a shared library. To
reference the <b  >strlenList</b> function, we must load
it into the current ksh environment through the
<b  >builtin</b> command (see line 29 of Listing
1).</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#pragma prototyped
#include "shell.h"
#include "stdio.h"
int b_strlenList(int argc, char **argv,
                 void *extra)
{
    register int max, n = 0
    char **cp = NULL;
    cp=argv;
    while ( *(++cp) ) {
        n = strlen(*cp);
        max = max &lt; n ? n : max;
    }
    fprintf(stdout,"%d\n", max);
    return(0);
}
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x12bf6d0"></a>Functions:</h2></div></div><p>ksh93 provides two methods for function definitions. The
formats are given as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
function <span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>
{
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>body</em></span>
}
<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>()
{
    <span   class="emphasis"><em>body</em></span>
}
</pre><p>The second function format is provided for compatibility with
POSIX standards. The primary distinction is that of variable name
scope. In a POSIX function, a variable definition has global scope.
In the following POSIX function <b  >bar</b>, variable
<b  >foo</b> is redefined to a value of 6.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typeset foo=5
bar()
{
    typeset foo=6
    echo $foo
}
bar
<span   class="bold"><b>6</b></span>
echo $foo
<span   class="bold"><b>6</b></span>
</pre><p>Variable definitions in ksh93 functions have local scope. In
the following ksh93 function <b  >bar</b>, a local
variable <b  >foo</b> is defined and has precedence over
the global variable <b  >foo</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
typeset foo=5
function bar
{
    typeset foo=6
    echo $foo
}
bar
<span   class="bold"><b>6</b></span>
echo $foo
<span   class="bold"><b>5</b></span>
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x12bfe08"></a>Discipline Functions</h2></div></div><p>ksh93 provides active variables through a series of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>discipline</em></span> functions. From the shell level,
you can write <span   class="emphasis"><em>get</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>set</em></span>,
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>unset</em></span> disciplines. Through the KornShell
Development Kit, you can also add disciplines unique to your
environment.</p><p>When a variable is referenced, as in <b  >$foo</b>,
ksh will invoke the get discipline associated with
<b  >foo</b>. The default discipline is to simply return
the current value associated with <b  >foo</b>. From the
shell level, you can define a <b  >foo.get</b> discipline
function.</p><p>The set discipline is called when a value is assigned to a
variable. Within the set discipline, the special variable
<b  >.sh.name</b> is the name of the variable whose value
is being set.</p><p>On line 31 of lsc, we define a
<b  >max_stringSize.get</b> discipline function. Every
reference to <b  >${max_stringSize}</b> will result in
this function being executed. The value of the special
<b  >.sh.value</b> variable is the value returned from
the discipline.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x12c0438"></a><b  >printf</b> Statement</h2></div></div><p>In ksh93, a <b  >printf</b> statement is available
following the ANSI C <b  >printf</b> definition. This
permits formatting specifications to be applied to each argument.
To appreciate the differences between the standard
<b  >print</b> and <b  >printf</b> statements,
consider how you would output the contents of the
<b  >entries</b> array (from the lsc example), one per
line. The standard print statement would display the file names as
space-separated tokens on a single line. Using the
<b  >printf</b> statement with a
<b  >"%s\n"</b> format, however, would produce the
desired results.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x15d3da0"></a>Arithmetic Commands</h2></div></div><p>ksh93 statements of the form <b  >((
<i><tt>expression</tt></i> ))</b> are called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>arithmetic</em></span> commands. Arithmetic commands
return True when the value of the enclosed expression is non-zero,
and False when the expression evaluates to zero. The construct
<b  >$((<i><tt>expression</tt></i>))</b> can
be used as a word or part of a word. It is replaced by the value of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>expression</em></span>.</p><p>In the lsc example, line 38, we evaluate the value of the
discipline function using:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
(( .sh.value = $(strlenList ${entries[@]}) + 3 ))
</pre><p>ksh93 will evaluate the expression, which includes an
assignment to the <b  >.sh.value</b> variable. Note that
the:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$(strlenList ${entries[@]})
</pre><p>will invoke the <b  >strlenList</b> built-in
function and return the maximum width of the strings (given as
element values) in the <b  >entries[]</b> array. We add 3
to this value for formatting purposes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x15d4378"></a>ANSI C Strings</h2></div></div><p>An ANSI C string is defined by preceding the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>single-quoted</em></span> string with a
<b  >$</b>. For example, <b  >$'*'</b> is the
literal asterisk, <b  >*</b>. With ANSI C strings, all
characters between the single quotes retain their literal meaning,
except for escape sequences. An escape sequence is introduced by
the escape character <b  >\</b>.</p><p>ANSI C string support provides an essential feature for shell
programmers. Consider, for example, having to process variables
with embedded tabs in their values. Without ANSI C string support,
we would not be able to effectively test the value of the variable
for embedded tabs. As an example, consider the following
script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print "foo\tbar" &gt; /tmp/foobar
read aline &lt; /tmp/foobar
if [[ "${aline}" == "foo\tbar" ]]
then print TRUE
fi
</pre><p>The comparison (see <span   class="bold"><b>Conditional
Commands</b></span>, below) will fail. We can replace the
conditional with ANSI C strings and ensure proper functionality.
The example above should be rewritten as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
print "foo\tbar" &gt; /tmp/foobar
read aline &lt; /tmp/foobar
if [[ "${aline}" == $'foo       bar' ]]
then    print TRUE
fi
</pre><p>On line 45 of Listing 1, we must test to see if the directory
is empty. The preceding <b  >entries=(*)</b> in an empty
directory will set the entries variable to the literal asterisk if
no files are found.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x15d48a0"></a>Conditional Commands</h2></div></div><p>A conditional command in ksh93 evaluates a test-expression
and returns either True or False. Conditional commands can be used
as part of an &ldquo;Or list&rdquo; (<b  >||</b>), &ldquo;And list&rdquo;
(<b  >&amp;&amp;</b>), or as part of an if-elif-else
command. Conditional commands have the format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[[ <span   class="emphasis"><em>test-expression</em></span> ]]
</pre><p>When used in conjunction with an &ldquo;And list&rdquo;, ksh93
evaluates the test-expression and will execute the &ldquo;And
component&rdquo; only if the test-expression evaluates to True. We use a
conditional command as part of an &ldquo;And list&rdquo; such that the return
statement will be executed only if the test-expression is
True.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[[ ${entries[0]} == $'*' ]] &amp;&amp; return 2
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x15d4bb8"></a>Iteration Control</h2></div></div><p>The <b  >for</b> command has two formats. The
traditional format is provided to iterate on each word in a list.
The format is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for <span   class="emphasis"><em>variableName</em></span> [ in <span   class="emphasis"><em>word-list</em></span> ]
do   <span   class="emphasis"><em>compound-list</em></span>
done
</pre><p>An arithmetic <b  >for</b> command has been
provided that is very similar to the C programming language
<b  >for</b> statement. The format is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for (( <span   class="emphasis"><em>initExpr</em></span> ; <span   class="emphasis"><em>condition</em></span> ; <span   class="emphasis"><em>loopExpr</em></span> ))
do   <span   class="emphasis"><em>compound-list</em></span>
done
</pre><p>The
<b  ><i><tt>initExpr</tt></i></b>ession is
evaluated by ksh prior to executing the <b  >for</b>
command. The
<b  ><i><tt>condition</tt></i></b> is then
evaluated prior to each iteration of
<b  ><i><tt>compound-list</tt></i></b>. If the
<b  ><i><tt>condition</tt></i></b> is
non-zero, then ksh executes the
<b  ><i><tt>compound-list</tt></i></b>. The
<b  ><i><tt>loopExpr</tt></i></b>ession is
evaluated at the end of each iteration.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x15d5608"></a>Name Referencing</h2></div></div><p>A new typeset option has been added for name referencing.
Using <b  >typeset -n
<i><tt>nameReference</tt></i>=<i><tt>variableName</tt></i></b>
will associate
<b  ><i><tt>nameReference</tt></i></b> with
<b  ><i><tt>variableName</tt></i></b>. A
special alias, <b  >nameref</b>, is provided as the
equivalent for <b  >typeset -n</b>. A shell script may
use the reference name to refer to the variable name. Name
referencing provides a convenient mechanism to pass the name of
compound variables, or arrays, to ksh functions. This is more
efficient than passing the variable's content.</p><p>In the lsc example, function <b  >setOutput</b>
must add the directory entries to the appropriate row and column.
We could have defined separate functions named
<b  >addToRow</b> and <b  >addToColumn</b> for
this purpose. The main body of the functions, however, would be
equivalent. Instead, we opted to write a single function
<b  >addToCell</b> that uses a <b  >nameref</b>
to the cell type passed as a parameter.</p><p>The <b  >addToCell</b> function accepts three
arguments, of which the first two are required. The first argument
is the cell type and must be either <b  >row</b> or
<b  >col</b>. We create a nameref using the local
variable <b  >cell</b> to be equivalent to the cell type
specified. A reference to <b  >${cell.index}</b> would
therefore be equivalent to <b  >${row.index}</b> or
<b  >${col.index}</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x15d5ef8"></a>FPATH</h2></div></div><p>ksh functions are not inherited across invocations of ksh. A
child shell process, for example, does not have access to the
functions defined within the parent ksh invocation. This has
historically limited the re-usability of ksh functions. As a
solution, ksh93 will search the colon-separated list of directories
given by the <b  >FPATH</b> variable value, for an
executable file with the same name as the function. In the lsc
example, we can eliminate the last statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lsc "${@}"
</pre><p>The <b  >FPATH</b> can then be set to the directory
containing the lsc file. From the shell level, we can now call lsc.
ksh93 will load the lsc script and will call the lsc function with
the command line arguments specified. Note that the supporting
functions defined in the lsc script are available to the lsc
function.</p><p>A function autoload feature is provided, in which an
auto-loaded function definition is loaded and retained within the
ksh93 environment upon the first reference to the function name.
This provides better performance since the search and load steps
are eliminated for subsequent references.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11ce580.0x1850bc8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>ksh93, the latest major revision of the KornShell language,
provides an alternative to Tcl and Perl. As a programming language,
it has comparable speed and functionality to each of these
languages. Like Tcl, it is extensible and embeddable with a C
language application programming interface. The New KornShell,
ksh93, and the Tksh products are available from Global
Technologies, Ltd., Inc., 5 West Ave, Old Bridge, NJ
908-251-2840.</p></div></div>
