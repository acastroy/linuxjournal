    How the Linux operating system made possible cost-effective
    company e-mail and created opportunities for adding useful
    services.

to support internal e-mail needs for about a year and a half when I
joined the organization in 1995 as an Information Services
Technician. The IS manager at that time had implemented cc:Mail
along with a major upgrade of computers to Windows 3.11. Networking
was installed to allow connections to a Novell server for file and
print services as well as access to the corporate accounting and
manufacturing software.
</p><p>Around my first year, the computer inventory, user base and
cc:Mail usage grew, requiring the purchase of additional licenses.
In 1996, my boss left to do independent consulting and I was given
the opportunity to run Information Services. A one-person
department has its advantages; in particular, I could make all
decisions regarding technology. It also has its disadvantages, such
as limited funding for projects and necessities like software
licenses.</p><p>During this time, our local phone company began providing
Internet service and Aerofil signed up for the corporate option,
including 20 e-mail accounts which were quickly issued to a
privileged few. No grandiose plan was in place with the initial
sign-up, but once a few employees had Internet e-mail, everyone
wanted it. Also, more and more of our customers wanted to
communicate in this way. Having the ISP maintain 70+ e-mail
accounts would obviously be costly, and we would not have control
over the accounts. The ability to change passwords was important.
So, I asked for help from our ISP in obtaining a domain name and in
hosting that domain for the company.</p><p>Because so many users required access to e-mail, I set up a
Linux machine with <span   class="bold"><b>diald</b></span> and IP
masquerading and named it &ldquo;Gatekeeper&rdquo;--an Intel P133 with 32MB
of RAM. This machine was a vast improvement over the previous
configuration in which certain individuals had their own modems,
plus we had a modem server that didn't allow more than one person
at a time to access it. With Gatekeeper running, everyone had equal
access. Whoever accessed it first would initiate the dial-in, but
once connected, everyone had instantaneous access. Typically, once
I had my e-mail client running, the connection was up all day. This
was not a problem for our ISP, since their heaviest usage occurred
between 8 PM and 10 PM. We were on-line only between 7 AM and 5
PM.</p><p>With the Linux machine in place, I investigated setting up
<span   class="bold"><b>fetchmail</b></span> so that we could handle
all of our own e-mail accounts. At the same time, I also began
looking at ways to gain more control of our web site maintenance.
Our ISP required that any changes be e-mailed to them for
implementation. They eventually set up a configuration to do this
using Samba, but it was still troublesome due to name-mangling
problems.</p><p>Once our ISP began offering DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
service, I decided to wait until DSL could be implemented before
pursuing direct e-mail and web site account management. Our IS
budget would not allow us to implement DSL as a solution until
January 1998.</p><p>In the meantime, in order to enable TCP/IP on our network, I
set up a second Linux machine, appropriately named IPkeeper, to act
as the DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server&mdash;an old
Intel 486SX33 with 16MB of RAM. This allowed us to specifically
assign IP addresses by hardware address or simply from a set range
of addresses. I set this up on a separate Linux machine in order to
simplify the Apache configuration on Gatekeeper and to segregate
the Intranet from the Internet.</p><p>In January of 1998, I placed the order for the DSL connection
and added an additional Ethernet card to Gatekeeper for the DSL
equipment connection. By February, Aerofil had a 128K connection to
the Internet. Testing showed the connection speed to be adequate
for hosting our web page. I then notified the ISP to make the
necessary changes to DNS to reflect our domain location at
Gatekeeper. I moved all of our web pages down and set up all the
e-mail accounts that had existed at our ISP, as well as adding
additional accounts for the other users who required e-mail. At
this time, the company drafted an Internet and E-mail Usage Policy
to discourage inappropriate use of the service. In hopes of
conserving bandwidth, Internet access was restricted to those users
with a justified need. This was accomplished by modifying the IP
masquerading rules on Gatekeeper to allow access to specified IP
addresses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x104b580.0x1143818"></a>The Intranet</h2></div></div><p>With IPkeeper on the network, even more opportunities were
available to us. Ongoing discussions had been held to decide how to
&ldquo;computerize&rdquo; corporate documents and make them accessible to
every PC on the network. A variety of software solutions for
Windows NT were looked into and found to be too expensive for our
company. Instead, I used existing Internet technology and set up
IPkeeper to host our Intranet, upgrading it to an Intel PII-233
with 32MB of RAM.</p><p>In June of 1998, the company hired a college student for the
summer to assist in getting our existing documents on-line. Some of
the documents were in a word-processor format, some were flowcharts
done in Visio, and some existed only in paper form. Several methods
were used to get this information onto the computer: scanning,
converting to PDF format and coding in HTML. Basically, I set up
various user areas to segregate the documents, such as Human
Resources, Information Services, Aerofil Process Descriptions,
Quality Control, Safety Process Descriptions, etc. Each area had
security set up to ensure that only designated users could add or
modify the information contained in it.</p><p><a href="3167f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure

implemented the search utility HT://DIG on IPkeeper. It has proven
to be one of the most useful features I have added. It allows our
users to type in any keyword and instantly see a list of
corresponding documents. I am also currently evaluating the
Cyberscheduler application for calendar and scheduling
services.</p><p>An LDAP (Lightweight Distributed Access Protocol) server is
being implemented for internal use on Gatekeeper so that users who
are using Netscape Communicator can get to a company e-mail
directory and utilize company mailing lists more easily.</p><p>Samba has also been enabled on both Linux machines, and I am
setting up home directories in order to lessen dependency on the
aging Novell server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x104b580.0x1143c38"></a>Future Projects</h2></div></div><p>The company has been investigating computer archive solutions
for old report data and converting report files from the business
accounting and manufacturing package to HTML so that the files can
be indexed and viewed with a browser. The plan is to set up a
system which will automatically process the report files,
eliminating the need to print monthly or weekly reports as they
will be easily accessible through the browser. Seth Golub's
(seth@cs.wustl.edu) <span   class="bold"><b>txt2html</b></span>
program is being used to convert the text report to an HTML file.
The most likely solution for indexing will be to index only the
report headers, which contain the necessary information for
locating a particular report.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x104b580.0x1143d98"></a>Final Comments</h2></div></div><p>For a mid-sized business such as ours, Linux was an obvious
choice. The company would have been years away from implementing
all the services we added if Linux had not been available. No other
operating system can allow as much scalability and flexibility for
its price.</p></div></div>
