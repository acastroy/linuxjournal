wonderful cover) our article &ldquo;Wireless Networking in Africa&rdquo; in
the December 1998 issue. We have received many compliments and
requests for more information. I wish to mention that Dr. Emmanuel
Ekuwem's name was omitted in the acknowledgments and request you
add his name to that section:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Our appreciation also goes to Dr. A. Nobile, one

complaining about the presence of advertising, it is easy for
readers who don't like the ads to skip them. I personally value the
ads. I want to know about the commercial products available for the
Linux world, and I want to know about the firms that deliver these
products. I vote for the ads.</p><p>&mdash;Chuck Jackson chuck@jacksons.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28bc580.0x29b44a8"></a>qmail Article in June</h2></div></div><p>I was just re-reading Mike Thomas' article &ldquo;Virtual Domains
and qmail&rdquo; in the June 1998 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and noticed that the qmail_db_lookup script
contains the test:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
elseif ($db_local_address eq $recipient) {
</pre><p>which could fail if the values of the two variables do not
have the same case. This could happen, since e-mail addresses are
case insensitive.
</p><p>Assuming all the entries in the database table are lower
case, I would do earlier on:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$recipient = lc @_[scalar(@_)-1];
</pre><p>or something equivalent. Of course, defensive programming
would require that we not make the assumption and change the test
to:
<pre     class="programlisting">
elseif ("\L$db_local_address" eq $recipient) {
</pre>


so one can sleep easy at night.

in my computing career have I worked with a more prompt or helpful
support staff. Their response time is incredible; I submitted a
Support Request to their web site and got a response in five
minutes! Via e-mail, Bryan (the Xi Graphics support engineer) and I
worked on a weird refresh rate problem I was having with Laptop
Accelerated X. It took a few rounds of e-mail back and forth, but
we got the problem straightened out and Bryan was patient and
helpful through it all.</p><p>Three cheers to Xi Graphics support!</p><p>&mdash;John Duksta jduksta@bbn.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28bc580.0x29b4a28"></a>Linux for Macintosh</h2></div></div><p>I am disappointed that the first substantive mention of Linux
for the Macintosh (&ldquo;Linux for Macintosh 68K Port&rdquo; by Alan Cox,
January 99) in the several months I have subscribed is an
aggressively hostile article about several generations of old
Macintosh hardware. Sure, people who know anything about
Macintoshes will also know the current hardware and Linux picture
for Macintoshes, but a very significant fraction, likely a large
majority of the readers, will read the article as being less about
the task of porting Linux (which it is about) and more about how
inferior the Macintosh is.</p><p>There is a vigorous Macintosh Linux community, both an
official Apple version (http://www.mklinux.apple.com/) and the even
more popular LinuxPPC (http://www.linuxppc.org/). Current Apple
hardware with Linux is as good as any. The author's second
sentence, &ldquo;... Apple does not want other operating systems on its
machines&rdquo; is refuted by the aforementioned official Apple
Linux.</p><p>I would say more, but I am probably going to get relegated to
the legion of Macintosh zealots anyway. Believe it or not, I don't
want Apple or Wintel to take over the world.</p><p>&mdash;Jeffrey L. Wragg wraggj@cofc.edu</p><p>Alan did mention the many users of Linux on the Macintosh,
and as you point out, his article was meant only as a report on how
to port the kernel, not how to use Linux on the Macintosh. We have
had articles in the past on using Linux on the Macintosh (see
issues 19, 31, 37 and 45) &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28bc580.0x29b4c90"></a>Red Hat Phenomenon</h2></div></div><p>I would like to join the chorus of voices of frustration with
the &ldquo;Red Hat&rdquo; phenomenon. If you follow other UNIX journals, you
will see a growing annoyance amongst UNIX users with Red Hat Linux.
There does not seem to be any reasonable explanation anywhere for
the strange Red Hat implementations. To quote Mike Borowiec on page
9 of the December 1998 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Performance Computing
Magazine</em></span>: &ldquo;I've since wiped the stain of [Red Hat]
Linux from my machine ...&rdquo;</p><p>Mike's problems are the same as everyone else's in the UNIX
community. Red Hat is unconventional in layout, difficult to
install, extremely difficult to reconfigure and deficient in basic
tools. The worst problem is that Red Hat requires extensive editing
of C source code and rebuilding of the kernel. This is not a Linux
problem&mdash;it is a Red Hat problem (other Linux distributions follow
conventional UNIX methods). What is Red Hat's objective in making
and promoting such a difficult implementation? Where are we heading
if Red Hat is creating such a negative reaction against Linux among
professionals? None of it makes even the slightest bit of sense to
a UNIX user.</p><p>The question you need to answer for us (since we cannot
figure it out on our own) is: why is Red Hat doing this to the
Linux community? And why are so many industry and media types
(including your magazine) getting behind Red Hat? Assuming that
what Red Hat is doing makes sense to somebody, we readers really
ought to have some kind of explanation so we can understand and
evaluate what's going on.</p><p>&mdash;Reilly Burke reilly@aerotraining.com</p><p>Sorry, you will have to ask Red Hat about their policies. I
am not in their confidence. However, Red Hat does seem to be the
most popular distribution available, so they must be doing
something right &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28bc580.0x29b4f50"></a>Porting MS-DOS Graphics Applications</h2></div></div><p>Thanks! Jawed Karimi's September 1998 <i  >LJ</i>
article (&ldquo;Porting MS-DOS Graphics Applications&rdquo;) on basic
graphics got me going in the right direction with SVGALIB. (I am a

regarding his article &ldquo;Samba's Encrypted Password Support&rdquo; in the
December 1998 issue.</p><p>In the last paragraph, he states &ldquo;Finally, to allow users to
update their encrypted password, set the permissions on smbpasswd
to be setuid root ..&rdquo;.</p><p>This should not be necessary, since
<span   class="bold"><b>smbpasswd</b></span> acts like an SMB client,
asking over an SMB session to change a user's password. This is the
reason you should include in smb.conf the &ldquo;allow hosts = 127&rdquo;
line, or leave it blank.</p><p>I have also used <span   class="bold"><b>pam_smb</b></span>,
which can be found on the main Samba FTP site, so that other
services can authenticate with Samba. On my system, my users all
have their passwords in /etc/shadow &ldquo;starred&rdquo; (*).</p><p>About the magazine, it's great!</p><p>&mdash;Celso Kopp Webber webber@sj.univali.rct-sc.br</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28bc580.0x29b5478"></a>Symbios Controllers and HP Scanjets</h2></div></div><p>The &ldquo;free&rdquo; controller shipped with a lot of scanners is the
Symbios 53C400A. It is not, as the writer of the reply (&ldquo;Best of
Technical Support&rdquo;, January 1999) suggested, 53c8xx compatible but
is instead a 5380 variant.</p><p>It is supported by current Linux 2.1.x series kernels,
although its lack of an IRQ and 8-bit ISAness make it a good
candidate for the bin, not a multiuser OS.</p><p>There is an equivalent patch for 2.0.x in the SANE mail
archive.</p><p>&mdash;Alan Cox alan@terrorserver.swansea.linux.org.uk</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28bc580.0x29b5688"></a><i  >Linux Journal</i> Enterprise
Solutions</h2></div></div><p>I think the supplement is a very good idea-I very much
enjoyed this special issue.</p><p>I would like the addition of a Table of Contents as in the
regular issues. This would be helpful because I (and perhaps
others) photocopy the Tables of Contents and put them in a
three-ring binder, where they are easier to scan than the issues
themselves.</p><p>Thanks for an excellent publication.</p><p>&mdash;Ray Liere lierer@cs.orst.edu</p><p>One of the weird rules of the Post Office is, if it has a
table of contents, it cannot be called a supplement. Go

<i  >LJ</i> who did such a great job presenting my
article in February. The magazine keeps getting better and
better.</p><p>By the way, my bio states that I maintain the &ldquo;official&rdquo;
Linux Csound, but that is no longer true. As of late 1998 I have
worked mainly with the development version available from Nicola
Bernardini's site at AIMI. The official version is currently
maintained at Bath by John Fitch.</p><p>Best of the New Year to all of you!</p><p>&mdash;Dave Phillips dlphilp@bright.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28bc580.0x29b5bb0"></a>Linux and Spouses</h2></div></div><p>For years I've maintained a dual boot machine at home with
both Windows 95 and Linux because my spouse didn't feel she could
learn the intricacies of Linux. So, it was a great pleasure to see
KDE chosen in your 1998 Reader's Choice poll. It was with KDE and
StarOffice that I finally won her over to the good side.</p><p>The ease of a standard desktop which was more intuitive than
Windows 9x has her singing its praises. I
thought I would never see the day. It should be pointed out that a
big turning point for her was the day she accidentally started
three different StarOffice sessions and was amazed that the system
didn't crash. It did take awhile for those monsters to load, but
once they finished, she was back in business. Windows
9x would have died at this point.</p><p>Now all I need is to find a calendar program which comes
close to Calendar Creator Plus and Windows 9x
will just be a bad memory in our house. Maybe korganizer will fill
the bill when it's completed.</p><p>&mdash;Randy Kyrk rkyrk@anet-chi.com</p></div></div>
