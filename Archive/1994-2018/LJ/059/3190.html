tutorial-style computer book that teaches the dedicated reader how
to set up and maintain an integrated network composed of a Linux
server and MS Windows 95 clients. At the core is, of course, Samba.
This very thick and well-written book covers just about every
aspect of Linux networking, not just integrating with Windows 95.
Various qualities of the book make it superior to other Linux books
of this type, but it still adheres to a few Linux book conventions
that are bothersome. The price precludes it from being a casual
purchase, but for the right Linux users, it is a worthwhile read
and investment.
</p><p>The most impressive aspect of this book is its structure. Mr.
Sery delivers a feeling of accomplishment in the first chapter and
builds with each successive chapter. Chapter 1 covers installing
Linux on a computer, connecting it to a Windows 95 network and
configuring the Samba basics. This is no small challenge and his
instructions are fairly straightforward if the reader is computer
savvy and willing to follow directions. If it doesn't work, the
second chapter on troubleshooting should help. With success in
hand, Sery goes back and explains Linux and its history and gives
recommendations on learning more (i.e., through various web sites,
books, etc.). In the following part, Sery returns to the Samba and
Linux configurations in much greater detail. He also includes a
chapter on putting a Linux server on the Internet, while dedicating
another chapter to sharing his skills as a network administrator.
He ends the book by returning to the beginning and guiding the
reader through the steps of setting up a complex Windows 95 network
with a Linux computer as its server. With this organizational
structure, Sery provides a very effective tutorial on Linux
networking.</p><p>At a price of about $50 US, however, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network
Toolkit</em></span> is a little costly for the average Linux user.
On the other hand, the average Linux user doesn't have a network at
home and probably doesn't get to use Linux at work. Those who do
use Linux at work might find it helps them advance in their job and
pay, perhaps convincing the boss to switch the office server over
to Linux. In my case, I was allowed to convert my computer at work
to Linux as long as I could interact with the network and not be a
burden to others. I met those requirements primarily with Samba and
WordPerfect for Linux. So, a book that helps the reader integrate
Linux into his office network is worth the cost.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network Toolkit</em></span> is nearly 600
pages long and comes with Red Hat 5.0 on CD. Some of the bulk seems
unnecessary: about 80 pages of appendices, 20 pages of Linux and
related history and a scattering of directory listings, standard
scripts and screen shots. The appendices cover
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span> commands, the GNU General
Public License, copyrights, a list of web sites and a description
of the contents of the CD. I could have done without these and wish
they had been written on the CD.</p><p>I find Linux's history to be very interesting, but I don't
understand why almost every Linux book insists on including it.
Sery's accounts of the origins of Linux, UNIX and Samba are
well-written, so although I fault him for including histories, I
prefer his histories to those in other Linux books I own.</p><p>As for directory listings and scripts, some take up to two
pages. Granted, they can be necessary, but many times it is
sufficient to tell the reader to type the commands and see what
happens.</p><p>Basically, the publisher, IDG Books Worldwide could have
eliminated about 150 pages and the CD and lowered the price. After
all, how many copies of Linux do I need? A lower price would have
been more palatable and allowed for more sales to make up for the
per-book profit.</p><p>Sery's approach suggests that he assumes the reader has a
fairly good knowledge of computers, but not necessarily much on
Linux, whereas the back cover suggests a reader level of
intermediate to advanced. This is probably more reasonable. I find
the book to be more appropriate for the Linux user who has long
since graduated from the &ldquo;new user&rdquo; category and is ready to
leave the &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; mode. It is also useful for the more
advanced user who has a few gaps in his knowledge or has never
attempted a Linux network. For these users, the book may work just
fine as a tutorial or a reference. Along those lines, at the end of
each chapter, Sery provides well-thought-out chapter summaries.
Most books provide these, of course, but they are often poorly
done. Sery's summaries are very effective in reinforcing what the
reader just read and later serving as a reference source.</p><p>The style of writing is in a somewhat standard form for
computer books, but more accessible. Sery occasionally writes in a
conversational tone. For instance, at times he uses words like
&ldquo;stuff&rdquo; and &ldquo;great&rdquo;. He doesn't hide from the reader, either.
He uses the pronouns &ldquo;I&rdquo; and &ldquo;me&rdquo; quite often. He also steps
out of character occasionally and lets his natural enthusiasm for
computers and Linux show through. He tells the reader how he found
certain aspects of Linux difficult and confusing when he was first
learning it; he then attempts to resolve these problems for the
reader. As part of this, Sery sometimes explains in simple terms,
step-by-step, the processes going on behind Linux commands. This,
to me, is an excellent way to write a useful and approachable Linux
book. It also makes it more enjoyable to read. After all, it is
about Linux, not stuffy old UNIX. It belongs to us, not rigid
institutional companies looking to make a quick billion.</p><p>Another accessible feature of Sery's book is the fact that he
compares commands in Linux to their counterparts in DOS and
Windows. Most Linux books don't do much of this, I believe, because
the writers are either coming from a UNIX background or they are
anti-Microsoft. If a reader comes from a UNIX background, he
probably won't need most of the books written about Linux. Ignoring
all that most readers have learned from the Microsoft environment
is counter-productive. When explaining the
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> command, does it really hurt to
say that it's like <span   class="bold"><b>dir</b></span> in MS-DOS?
Where appropriate, Sery provides these useful links to what the
reader likely already knows. In so doing, he helps the reader learn
faster and appreciate the greater flexibility and power of
Linux.</p><p>One other warning: this is definitely a pro-Red Hat book. I
mention this only because before I was a Red Hat user, I hated to
spend $30 or more on a Linux book, then find out one-fourth of it
was a Red Hat manual. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network Toolkit</em></span>
comes with Red Hat 5.0 and contains many comments on how Red Hat is
configured. If I were a Debian user, I would probably say it
contains an excessive amount of comments on Red Hat. One plus for
users of other distributions that use
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> is that it provides
information on several rpm commands the Red Hat manual.</p><p>In conclusion, I would recommend <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Network
Toolkit</em></span> to intermediate Linux users who are constructing
and maintaining an integrated Linux network. The price is a little
high, but it can be justified for certain readers and needs. The
book is partial to Red Hat and has the usual Linux book fillers.
All in all, though, it is a well-written, approachable tutorial on
Linux networking.</p></div></div>
