    Linux enters the mainstream as companies such as Learning
    Tree and Caldera offer training courses for Linux. Here
    Learning Tree tells us why they are doing it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x106d580.0x11653a0"></a></h2></div></div><p> Adding further weight to the growing
acceptance of Linux as an industrial-strength operating system,
Learning Tree International, a world-wide supplier of technology
training, recently announced a four-day, hands-on course aimed
specifically at users and administrators planning to deploy Linux
in a commercial environment. We at <i  >Linux Journal</i> feel strongly that training courses for Linux
will help bring it into the mainstream marketplace. With this in
mind, I talked to Chris Brown, Product Manager for UNIX and C/C++
Courses, by e-mail during October.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Tell us something
about your UNIX courses and why you decided to begin offering Linux
courses.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Chris</b></span>: Learning Tree has
offered a wide variety of UNIX courses for several years, and until
recently, most of them used Solaris as a platform for the in-class
exercises&mdash;some of them still do. However, an increasing number of
courses ranging from UNIX Programming to UNIX Security are now
taught using Linux.</p><p>The company also uses Linux in courses outside the UNIX
curriculum, including some of the TCP/IP, networking and web
courses.</p><p>We had to consider the dilemma of the free software culture
versus the non-free Learning Tree training culture. Would people
who used free software be willing to pay for their training? Only
time will tell. Certainly, if you look at the total cost of
ownership, paying for Linux training makes just as much sense as
paying for NT training.</p><p>John Moriarty, who heads up our product development team, had
these comments:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We were rather nervous at first about introducing
Linux into the classroom, not on technical grounds, but simply
because we wondered how our customers would react. Having paid good
money for their training, would they mind finding a free operating
system on the machines in front of them? So far, I haven't heard a
single complaint. In fact, some attendees get really fired up to
discover that for very little money, they can practice their UNIX
skills on a PC at home. We've had students who have gone to a store
in the evening, bought a copy of Linux, and installed it on a spare
machine in class the next day.</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>:
What do you find most attractive about Linux?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Chris</b></span>: Learning Tree's main
reason for using Linux is not, for the most part, because it is
free. More important is that it is easy to install. The company has
over 2,500 PCs in classrooms around the world and at the start of
each week, virtually every single one gets reloaded from scratch
with the operating system, applications and software needed for
that week's course.</p><p>Dave O'Neal, who runs one of the company's three development
labs, comments:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We've put huge amounts of effort into finding
ways to load software onto machines quickly and reliably. It
wouldn't be so bad if all our PCs were the same, but they're not.
The bottom line is that once the software is loaded and the machine
rebooted, it <span   class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> to work. There isn't time for
manual reconfiguration or firefighting. We find that Linux is
extremely good at figuring out what hardware is out there, loading
the right drivers and booting successfully.</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>:
Tell us more about what the class offers.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Chris</b></span>: The course with Linux
as its central focus has an explicit mission of promoting the use
of Linux within a commercial environment, and we target it
specifically for people who need to support Linux in business. In
the course, students learn how to install and configure Linux,
download and install software from the Internet, build kernels,
provide FTP, web and mail services and even how to interoperate
with Microsoft.</p><p>Learning Tree is a totally independent supplier of training,
so we retain the freedom to mention the bad as well as the good
things about the products and technologies we teach. Linux
consultant Phill Edwards, who authored the Linux course, recalls an
incident at the beta test stage:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Some of the other members of the development team
were playing around at the back of the room and discovered that it
was rather easy to start from the LILO prompt and obtain a root
shell without giving the root password. It was rather gratifying to
be able to not only point out the loophole, but show students how
to fix it.</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>:
Any parting words?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Chris</b></span>: Of course there will
always be those who are happy to learn Linux by sitting down with
the product and a book and playing with it. It is a great way to
learn; I originally learned UNIX the same way&mdash;except in those
days, UNIX wasn't really a product. Now that I think of it, books
weren't available either&mdash;that works fine if you have the time.
However, if you need to get up to speed fast, intensive training is
a very effective way to do it.</p><p>Learning Tree courses are offered in the USA, Canada, UK and
elsewhere. Our web site at http://www.learningtree.com/linux has
detailed course outlines, prices and scheduling.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Marjorie</b></span>: Thanks for your
time.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3224f1.jpg"></div></div></div>
