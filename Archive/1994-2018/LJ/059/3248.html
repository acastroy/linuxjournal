well-written and an improvement over the first edition in many
ways. The bundled CD, Red Hat Linux version 5.1 with Linux kernel
2.2.35, offers several enhancements over the Slackware distribution
provided with the first edition. I highly recommend this book as a
powerful addition to any Linux system administrator's technical
library. <span   class="emphasis"><em>LINUX Secrets</em></span> is geared toward the
intermediate to advanced reader. Novices should consider a more
straightforward and less complex manual, such as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Teach
Yourself Linux in 24 Hours</em></span> by Billy Ball from Sams
Press, which comes with version 5.0 of Red Hat Linux.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>LINUX Secrets</em></span> is organized quite nicely
into four sections and two appendices. Chapters 1 and 2 explain
installation and configuration. Chapters 3 through 8 cover basic
software applications and operations. Chapters 9 through 17 give
detailed information on hardware. Chapters 18 through 23 contain
advanced topics related to using Linux in business. Appendix A is a
rundown of graphical X programs included with the distribution.
Appendix B is a very handy list of frequently used Linux commands,
with appropriate command line parameters and options. Overall, this
organization works fine, although the reader may want to take a
look at Appendix A after reading chapter 2 and before proceeding to
chapter 3. Also, the reader may find it more logical to transpose
Dial-Up Networking (chapter 18) and Tcl/Tk Scripting (chapter
8).</p><p>I like Naba Barkakati's style of writing. It is highly
technical without sounding that way and is very easy and
interesting to read, even for the newcomer. He makes good use of
margin icons and cross references to related concepts and tasks.
The index is thorough, precise and highly efficient.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>LINUX Secrets</em></span> contains pertinent,
comprehensive, timely and accurate information. Naba Barkakati
covers all the main topics and misses little. I did notice some
mismatches; however, they were minor and appeared to be primarily
by-products of switching from Slackware to Red Hat, and of the
decision to include a newer version of the operating system kernel
(2.2.35) than described throughout the book (2.2.32-34).</p><p>The CD comes with all the necessary tools to build a basic
Linux workstation or an industrial-strength work group, Intranet or
Internet server. This includes a plethora of useful software
applications such as the X Window System, window managers styled
after Motif and NextStep, games (Chess, Galaga, Backgammon),
Midnight Commander file manager, text editors, graphics and paint
programs, spreadsheet, music CD player, Apache web server, Netscape
Navigator, DOS/Windows connectivity tools (Samba LAN Manager, VFAT
support), communications programs, C/C++ compilers, TCP/IP
networking, a suite of applications (PPP, POP3 mail clients,
TELNET, FTP, DNS, NFS, Sendmail, news servers and readers) and
power tools such as GNU Emacs, Perl, Tcl/Tk, X programming and RCS.
IP masquerading in an office or home LAN configuration even enables
a Linux box to function as an effective Internet router at a
fraction of the cost of competing technological solutions.</p><p>Red Hat has done a great job of streamlining, automating and
&ldquo;dummy-proofing&rdquo; the installation process. They created a
graphical installation program that runs by default on booting from
the created boot disk. They also improved maintenance prospects by
including the Red Hat Package Manager
(<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span>) to facilitate installing,
uninstalling and verifying installation of add-on software
applications.</p><p>Red Hat Linux used &ldquo;autoprobing&rdquo; to automatically configure
the majority of my hardware devices. I was up and running in less
than an hour, playing the Galaga video game in X and accessing
resources on my local area network (I rebooted only once). The X
server is much improved over the GUI distributed with Slackware and
comes with a nice assortment of flexible window managers. Mr.
Barkakati efficiently walks the user through a typical
installation. His instructions are comprehensive, detailed where
necessary and well-written and organized. I found this version of
Linux to be easier, cleaner and more efficient than Slackware. I
get none of the error messages or slow bootup processes common to
some earlier versions. Countless modifications and tweaks have been
included by Red Hat with this distribution, making it a real joy to
use.</p><p>However, this doesn't mean Linux installations are finally
ready for prime time. I think a more flexible and robust
installation program would serve users better in the next iteration
of Red Hat Linux. Specifically, the Druid
<span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span> partition tool
&ldquo;alternative&rdquo; doesn't function as well as it should with second
hard disks. Also, the LILO boot manager doesn't provide the option
to initially install on a floppy disk to prevent writing over NT,
OS/2 and Windows 95 Master Boot Record information.</p><p>It would be nice to see some extra CD goodies included, such
as Doom and Quake which are freely available elsewhere. Also
helpful would be a loadable module for sound card support to avoid
having to manually configure and rebuild the kernel (and install
the kernel source files, which aren't loaded by default). The
assortment of arcane and unfriendly text editors leaves a lot to be
desired&mdash;Linux is in dire need of an intuitive, commercial-quality,
freeware, GUI-based word processor (I typed this using vi and the
Pine mail reader&mdash;Wordpad for Linux, anyone?).</p><p>The time and effort required to get a Linux system up and
running, connected to the Internet, printing, sending e-mail and
accessing multimedia content is still way behind the power curve
compared to other web-optimized, user-friendly operating systems.
These things must become ubiquitous before Linux can compete as a
viable desktop operating system for the masses (complain all you
want about Bill's market influence and control, but he gave us
exactly what we want and need: an easy-to-use GUI that is
multimedia-capable and Internet-aware, with an operating system and
application installation paradigm we can all live with).</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>LINUX Secrets</em></span> would benefit from more
detail on using the X GUI-based Control Panel configuration tools
(kernel, LILO, modem, networking, users/groups, etc.). Also, some
of the old Slackware-documented methods should be standardized and
made consistent with Red Hat Linux.</p><p>All in all, this is a great book and well worth the
price.</p></div></div>
