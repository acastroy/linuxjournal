    Mr. Lerner shows us how to add a full-text search to our
    BBS.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272f580.0x28274a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the last two months, we have looked
at a simple bulletin-board system that can be incorporated into a
web site. This BBS groups messages by subject or thread, and stores
the messages in a relational database.
</p><p>As we have seen in the last two installments of ATF, using a
database for information storage and retrieval significantly
reduces the amount of development work necessary to implement such
a system. Given the ease with which I was able to implement the
BBS, I decided to add several more features which can help users
navigate their way through and use the BBS.</p><p>This month, we will look at how to implement several of these
features. The most important is full-text search, which allows
users to find interesting postings based on keywords. This saves
them from having to search through a thread, which might not have
an appropriate or easy-to-understand title. Then we will look at a
tool that allows administrators to remove inappropriate postings
without having to go into the guts of the database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272f580.0x2827660"></a>In Case You Just Tuned In</h2></div></div><p>If you did not catch the last two installments of &ldquo;At the
Forge&rdquo;, let's take a quick look at how the BBS is implemented. I
used MySQL (see Resources), a relational database that has gained
quite a bit of popularity among web programmers. Information in a
relational database is stored in tables, in which the rows
represent records and the columns represent fields.</p><p>We define the columns with SQL, the Structured Query Language
that is a well-known standard for working with relational
databases. Our BBS will contain two separate tables, ATFThreads
(for keeping track of the individual threads, including the initial
posting) and ATFMessages (for keeping track of individual
messages). SQL is sent to a database server from a database client;
this can be a programmatic client (e.g., a CGI program) or an
interactive client (e.g., the
<span   class="bold"><b>mysql</b></span> program that comes with
MySQL). I normally use interactive clients for table creation,
maintenance and debugging, but we can create our two tables with
the following SQL:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE ATFThreads (
id SMALLINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    subject VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(subject)
)
CREATE TABLE ATFMessages (
    id MEDIUMINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    thread SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    subject VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL DEFAULT
    "No subject",
    date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL DEFAULT
    "Mr. Nobody",
    email VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL DEFAULT
    "atf@lerner.co.il",
    text TEXT NOT NULL
)
</pre><p>If you enter the above into the interactive mysql program,
you will want to put a semicolon (;) after each query to indicate
that you want mysql to execute the query right away, rather than
wait for additional input.
</p><p>Once we have created the tables, we will have to write some
programs&mdash;in our case, CGI programs&mdash;that manipulate the data. We
will not write programs with SQL directly, but will create it
within our CGI programs. Using Perl for such CGI programs is
particularly easy once we use CGI.pm (the standard Perl module for
CGI programs) and DBI (Perl's generic database interface).</p><p>The entire bulletin board system consists of about seven
programs, each of which handles a different aspect of the system.
You can download the programs from the FTP sites
<a href="../listings/057/3193.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue57/3193.tgz</a>
and
<a href="../listings/058/3252.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue58/3252.tgz</a>
Listings for this article will be in
<a href="../listings/059/3296.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue59/3296.tgz</a></p><p>Now that we have given the basic functionality a quick
discussion, let's start to add some advanced functionality to our
BBS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272f580.0x2827ad8"></a>Searching</h2></div></div><p>The first new function we will add to the BBS is full-text
searching. I have long been a fan of full-text search, both on the
Web and elsewhere. According to Jakob Nielsen, probably the
best-known web-usability researcher, many users are
&ldquo;search-dominant&rdquo;. This means they prefer to search through a
site for content, rather than traverse through trees of hyperlinks.
(See Resources for more information on Nielsen, including the URL
of his article.)</p><p>While the threaded structure of our BBS makes it relatively
easy to find postings on a particular topic, undoubtedly there will
be times when subject lines fail to reflect the actual content or
when discussions veer into unexpected or unusual directions.
Allowing users to search for words or phrases makes it easier for
them to find what they want. Best of all, because the search
functionality is in a separate program, it slows down the system
only when someone uses it. If no one ever searches through the BBS,
the system will not be slowed down.</p><p>MySQL allows for two kinds of searches through a table, with
either SQL regular expressions or UNIX-style regular expressions.
SQL regular expressions might seem silly to someone used to working
with UNIX, but they are guaranteed to work on any database system
that adheres to SQL standards. SQL regular expressions have two
special characters: % (which matches zero or more characters) and _
(which matches exactly one character). To escape these special
characters, you insert a leading backslash (\). To get a literal
backslash, you insert two backslashes (\\).</p><p>To search for a match with SQL regular expressions, you use
the <b  >LIKE</b> operator within a
<b  >SELECT</b> statement. This returns all of the rows
for which the regular expression finds a match. For
instance:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT text FROM ATFMessages WHERE text LIKE "a%"
</pre><p>will retrieve all message texts that begin with the letter a,
followed by zero or more characters.
</p><p>If you prefer UNIX-style regular expressions, MySQL allows
you to use the <b  >REGEXP</b> (or
<b  >RLIKE</b>) operator, as in</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT text FROM ATFMessages WHERE text RLIKE "a.*"
</pre><p>This will perform the same function as above.
</p><p>Rather than force one system on all users, I decided to allow
for both literal text and UNIX regular expressions. UNIX regular
expressions are hard for most people to learn and understand, so
the default is to allow for literal text searches. We perform a
literal text search by using the LIKE operator, escaping the two
SQL regular expression meta-characters with backslashes.</p><p>The search form itself (search-form.shtml, see Listing 1 in
the archive file for an expanded version) is thus very
short:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;P&gt;Search for: &lt;input type="text"
name="term"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;input type="radio" name="regexp"
   checked value="no"&gt;Literal search
&lt;input type="radio" name="regexp"
   value="yes"&gt;Use regular expressions
&lt;input type="submit" value="Search!"&gt;
</pre><p>This form is submitted to the CGI program search.pl (Listing
2 in the archive file), which performs the actual searching.
Search.pl is also fairly simple, although the SQL query is the most
complex we have seen in this project. That's because we have to
search through ATFMessages to find matches. We also need the
message's thread ID number in order to create a hyperlink to
view-thread.pl, which allows users to look at that thread.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272f580.0x2828160"></a>Creating the Search Query</h2></div></div><p>We perform what is known as a &ldquo;join&rdquo; between the two
tables, selecting several columns from ATFMessages and one column
from ATFThreads. Joins allow us to take only the most interesting
columns from two or more tables, grabbing only those matching our
criteria. Always remember to set up a relationship among the
tables, otherwise you will get the &ldquo;Cartesian product&rdquo; of the
results, with each of the rows in table A matched up with each of
the rows in table B. We thus avoid selection like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT M.id, M.thread, M.subject, M.author,
   T.subject
FROM ATFMessages M, ATFThreads T
</pre><p>which will produce the Cartesian product. Instead, we use
<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT M.id, M.thread, M.subject, M.author,
   T.subject
FROM ATFMessages M, ATFThreads T
AND M.thread = T.id
ORDER BY M.date desc
</pre>


which qualifies the relationship between ATFMessages (given the
nickname &ldquo;M&rdquo; in this query) and ATFThreads (with the nickname T),
then lists the resulting rows in descending date order.
</p><p>We also test the value of <b  >$regexp</b>, which
is set to the value of the &ldquo;regexp&rdquo; radio button. If
<b  >$regexp</b> is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, we use the REGEXP operator
in our SQL query and perform a regular expression search.
Otherwise, we escape the SQL characters % and _ and use the LIKE
operator. The Perl code to make this query possible looks like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $sql = "SELECT M.id, M.thread, M.subject, M.author, T.subject ";
$sql .= "FROM ATFMessages M, ATFThreads T ";
if ($regexp eq "yes")
{
    $sql .= "WHERE M.text REGEXP \"$term\" ";
}
else
{
    $term =~ s|%|\\\%|g;
    $term =~ s|_|\\\_|g;
    $sql .= "WHERE M.text LIKE \"%$term%\" ";
}
$sql .= "AND M.thread = T.id ";
$sql .= "ORDER BY M.date desc";
</pre><p>Because we build the SQL query by combining text strings, we
can conditionally modify parts of the query, as we saw above.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272f580.0x2828528"></a>Parsing the Search Results</h2></div></div><p>Results from a SQL <b  >SELECT</b> query are always
returned in a table, in which the columns are the rows requested in
the query and the rows are those matching the criteria from the
query. With DBI, reading the results from a query usually means
iterating through the rows from within a Perl
<b  >while</b> loop.</p><p>DBI provides a number of methods for retrieving the values
returned by a SELECT, but perhaps the easiest one to understand is
the simple <span   class="bold"><b>fetchrow_array</b></span> method.
This method is defined for <b  >$sth</b>, the &ldquo;statement
handle&rdquo; through which we submit our query and retrieve its
results.</p><p>Several methods can be used to retrieve the results from our
SELECT, but the easiest one to understand is
<b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow_array</b>, which returns one row
from the response. Each time we invoke
<b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow_array</b>, the next row from the
response table is returned. After
<b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow_array</b> returns the last row of
the response table, it returns &ldquo;false&rdquo;. By putting
<b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow_array</b> inside of a
<b  >while</b> loop, we can iterate through each of the
rows in the response table.</p><p>Here, then, is the code from search.pl that iterates through
the results table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
while (my @row = $sth
{
  ($message_id, $thread_id, $subject, $author,
    $thread_name) = @row;
  print "&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/cgi-bin/view-thread.pl?";
  print "$thread_id#$message_id\"&gt;$subject&lt;/a&gt;, ";
  print "by $author in ";
  print
"&lt;a href=\"/cgi-bin/view-thread.pl?$thread_id\"&gt;";
  print "$thread_name&lt;/a&gt;\n";
}
</pre><p>As you can see, we assign a number of scalars to the
individual elements in <b  >@row</b>. DBI returns NULL
elements (that is, elements that lack a value, rather than the
C/Perl notion of &ldquo;true&rdquo; being non-zero) as undefined, so you can
test for a value with Perl's built-in defined function. Once we
have extracted the elements of <b  >@row</b> into a
number of easy-to-identify scalars, we can then use them to print
results to the user's browser.
</p><p>Notice how each of the hyperlinks we create does not simply
point to a thread, but also to a message. We can do this by taking
advantage of named anchors within a link, which allow us to force
the user's browser to scroll to a particular point. If you are
unfamiliar with named anchors, here is a quick lesson: in the link
http://www.ssc.com/test.html#testing, &ldquo;testing&rdquo; is the named
anchor and points to a location in test.html marked with the tag
<b  >&lt;a name="testing"&gt;</b>. If no such tag exists,
adding the named anchor to the URL has no effect.</p><p>Because our program view-thread.pl (discussed last month)
places such a named anchor at the beginning of each message header
within a thread, we can thus point users directly to the message
that matched their search string, rather than to the thread.</p><p>By the way, if you are interested in getting the greatest
possible speed out of your application, you might want to consider
using <b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref</b> rather than
<b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow_array</b>. The difference, as you
might guess from their names, is that the former method returns an
array reference, while the latter returns an array.</p><p>Passing a reference will always be faster than passing an
array, since it involves manipulating fewer bytes. I chose to work
with <b  >$sth-&gt;fetchrow_array</b> partly because it
simplified the rest of the code, and partly because I felt that we
would be handling small amounts of data anyway and that the speed
difference would not be too significant.</p><p>With these two files&mdash;search-form.html and
search.pl&mdash;installed on our server, we now have the ability to
search through the text of any message. With a few new links to the
search form from our main page, this functionality is integrated
into our system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272f580.0x2c21118"></a>Administration Tools</h2></div></div><p>Whenever I work on a web site that involves databases, I
almost always include one or two web-based administrative tools.
Such tools are useful for a number of reasons, the most obvious of
which is their utility for people who want to manipulate the
database without learning SQL. (They also allow you to shield the
database from people who think they understand SQL, only to
discover there is not any way to undo a DROP TABLE command.)</p><p>Which tools are necessary and which functions they must
perform will depend on the web application you have written, as
well as the needs of your individual users. We will look at a
simple application called zap-thread.pl, which allows
administrators to delete one or more discussion threads.</p><p>In order to ensure that only authorized users can zap
threads, we will include a password field, adding the variable
<span   class="emphasis"><em>$zap_password</em></span> to ATFConstants.pm, the module
containing all of our global variables. (See Listing 4 in the
archive file.)</p><p>While there are a number of ways in which we could implement
zap-thread.pl, I found it easiest to write a single program that
has two different personalities. When invoked with the GET method,
zap-thread.pl produces an HTML form that can be used to delete
threads, including a text field into which the user must enter a
password.</p><p>When invoked with POST, zap-thread.pl assumes it was invoked
by the form produced by its GET personality. It expects to receive
two different sorts of HTML form elements: a password in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>password</em></span> form element, which must be compared
with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>$zap_password</em></span> variable, and one or
more check boxes named &ldquo;thread-x&rdquo;, where <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>
is the ID number of the thread in the database.</p><p>Before doing anything else, our program compares the password
it received with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>$zap_password</em></span> variable.
If they match, we continue without comment. If they fail to match,
we produce an error message telling the user that the password did
not match.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x272f580.0x2c21590"></a>Deleting the Thread</h2></div></div><p>We can iterate through the <b  >thread-x</b>
elements in a number of ways, but I found the easiest way was to
iterate through each element, ignoring any elements that failed to
match the &ldquo;thread-x&rdquo; pattern. By capturing the number within
parentheses:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
next unless ($element =~ m/^thread-(\d+)$/);
</pre><p>we can then grab it using the $1 variable, which retrieves
whatever was in the first set of parentheses in the last match:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $thread_id = $1;
</pre>


Once we have retrieved the thread ID number, we need to delete
matching rows from ATFThreads, which contains the master list of
threads, and from ATFMessages, which contains the messages
themselves. If we were to delete rows from only ATFThreads, we
would run a substantial risk of MySQL reusing the thread ID number
with a new thread&mdash;which would effectively put all of our
supposedly deleted messages in the new thread.
</p><p>We delete them by sending two separate SQL queries, printing
a brief status message to the user's browser:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $sql  = "DELETE FROM ATFThreads WHERE id = $thread_id ";
warn "SQL: \"$sql\"\n";
my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare ($sql);
my $result = $sth-&gt;execute;
die("Error deleting from ATFThreads: " .
    $sth-&gt;errstr) unless $result;
print "&lt;P&gt;Deleted the thread.&lt;/P&gt;\n";
# Delete messages for this thread from ATFMessages
$sql  = "DELETE FROM ATFMessages WHERE thread = $thread_id ";
warn "SQL: \"$sql\"\n";
$sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare ($sql);
$result = $sth-&gt;execute;
die("Error deleting from ATFMessages: " .
    $sth-&gt;errstr) unless $result;
print "&lt;P&gt;Deleted messages in the thread.&lt;/P&gt;\n";
    }
</pre><p>By putting the DELETE commands inside of a
<b  >foreach</b> loop, we make it possible to delete more
than one thread. If the user indicates that three threads should be
deleted, we will enter the loop three times, deleting each thread
in sequence.
</p><p>There is at least one problem with this implementation of
zap-thread.pl, and that is the lack of an
<span   class="bold"><b>undo</b></span> function. What happens if you
delete the wrong thread? Perhaps the easiest way to implement such
an undelete function would be to change the underlying tables,
adding a new &ldquo;active&rdquo; column to ATFThreads and ATFMessages. This
column would contain a single true/false value, perhaps implemented
with a TINYINT or an ENUM type.</p><p>With such table definitions in place, deleting a thread would
involve an UPDATE query (rather than the current DELETE query) to
modify the value in that column. Such a change would also require
some adjustments to list-threads.pl and view-thread.pl, so that
they only SELECT those rows WHERE <b  >active="true"</b>,
or a similar condition.</p><p>Another potential issue with zap-thread.pl is that it
operates on a per-thread basis. There are undoubtedly times when we
will want to delete an individual message, rather than a whole
thread. Creating such a program would be a bit more difficult than
zap-thread.pl, but the true challenge is in the user interface.
Using zap-thread.pl will be difficult enough with 100 threads;
trying to find an interface appropriate for zapping individual
messages would be even more difficult. The best approach might
involve breaking the program into two smaller programs, one for
selecting a thread and another for selecting a message.</p><p>As with most software projects, this BBS has almost unlimited
potential for improvement and expansion. A number of ways remain in
which this software could be improved&mdash;allowing for sub-threads,
providing for moderated discussions, sending e-mail to some or all
participants in a thread when a new posting is added, allowing
users to edit their own postings and even an integrated
spell-checker.</p><p>Finally, notice how our web BBS application used separate CGI
programs, rather than one single large program. Using a suite of
related programs is not the only way to design such applications,
but I find it to be the easiest way to create such functionality.
Not only does it allow breaking the problem into separate slices,
but it also allows for incremental implementation&mdash;which comes in
handy when a client is breathing down your neck, wanting to see
results right away.</p><p><a href="3296s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
