    At the risk of sounding like a surfer, KDE was the
    sharpest, coolest window display I had ever seen on any operating
    system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1172580.0x126a3f8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Developer: KDE Project Team</p></li><li><p>URL: http://www.kde.org/</p></li><li><p>Price: free</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Bill Cunningham</p></li></ul></div><p>Everyone's done a double-take at one time or another. For me,
they can be the result of seeing a European sports car, a pretty
girl or a UFO. I did a double-take on catching sight of a Linux
window manager recently.
</p><p>About a month ago, I received a S.u.S.E. flyer in the mail.
The flyer had a screenshot of a new window manager called KDE, the
K Desktop Environment, up and running. At the risk of sounding like
a surfer, KDE was the sharpest, coolest window display I had ever
seen on any operating system. I wanted my Linux desktop to look
exactly like that.</p><p>Figure 1 is the screenshot that sold me. Compared to KDE, my
old standby, FVWM, looked downright humble. I vowed to get KDE as
soon as possible.</p><p><a href="3111f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. KDE
Screenshot</b></span></a></p><p>A Yahoo search led me to the KDE project's page at
http://www.kde.org/. The web site has extensive documentation that
I won't recite here. A slide show at http://www.kde.org/kdeslides/
summarizes the whole project quite nicely.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1172580.0x126aa28"></a>What is it?</h2></div></div><p>KDE is primarily a complete, windows-based graphical
operating environment for UNIX platforms. The KDE Core, also called
<span   class="bold"><b>kdebase</b></span>, comes with a highly
configurable window manager, control panel, file manager and
virtual terminal. A user can download and install just the core
package and be up and running in fine style. All your original X
Window System applications will still work as before.</p><p>However, to fully benefit from KDE, one can additionally
install specialized, interoperative application suites from any or
all of these functional areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>multimedia</p></li><li><p>graphics</p></li><li><p>utilities</p></li><li><p>games</p></li><li><p>networking</p></li><li><p>system administration</p></li></ul></div><p>More will surely appear in the future.
</p><p>These applications were designed to be highly interoperable.
At first, I wanted only the basic desktop. It proved to be so
powerful and easy to use that I quickly decided to get the
multimedia package. These applications work equally well.
Inevitably, I will have all the KDE packages by Christmas.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1172580.0x126b108"></a>First Impressions</h2></div></div><p>In my experience so far, KDE seems to be quite solid. The
basic desktop takes about five seconds longer to come up than FVWM
did (I have a P-133, 32MB RAM). Once up, however, the applications
run noticeably quicker than comparable, older applications under
FVWM. The applications are sharp-looking and responsive. Memory
usage seems to be no more than non-KDE applications use. On my
system, I had Netscape, the Applix word processor, one kvt and an
active PPP connection running simultaneously before I saw any
swapping. Even then, I had about 66% of my 16MB swap space still
free. This is about the same system usage required by FVWM.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1172580.0x126b210"></a>Aesthetics</h2></div></div><p>Working with FVWM is sort of like ice skating on a vast,
frozen lake. With KDE, I can have fun on my computer for hours
changing the background pattern, moving scrollbars around and
fiddling with the controls. Sure, all this was possible with FVWM,
but who ever had time to figure out how? With KDE, every aspect of
the desktop's appearance is configurable with a couple of mouse
clicks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1172580.0x126b318"></a>Who is Shipping with KDE?</h2></div></div><p>Linux distributions from all over the world are now shipping
with KDE. Here are some of the latest:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>German companies S.u.S.E GmbH, Delix Computer GmbH
and Chip Extra Magazine</p></li><li><p>Caldera OpenLinux 1.2</p></li><li><p>PTS Linux</p></li><li><p>Eurielec 98 and COX-Red Hat 5.0 (Spanish)</p></li><li><p>Dream (French computer magazine)</p></li><li><p>Turkuaz (Turkish Linux distribution)</p></li><li><p>Connectiva (Brazilian-Portuguese)</p></li><li><p>Linux Mandrake</p></li><li><p>Walnut Creek's FreeBSD 2.2.7</p></li><li><p>InfoMagic</p></li><li><p>Stampede</p></li><li><p>LinuxPPC 1998 (PowerPC)</p></li><li><p>MkLinux (Power Macintosh)</p></li></ul></div><p>New Linux users will probably use KDE as their X interface
from the beginning. The following information is for users who
would like to switch to KDE from another window manager.
</p><p>The only warning I would make at this point is that KDE is
somewhat large. Together, kdebase and kdelibs take up about 20MB
once installed. The kdesupport package was another 4MB installed,
and multimedia added 5.4MB. For most hard drives, these numbers are
a drop in the bucket. I would even go so far as to say that KDE is
worth buying a new hard drive for, if yours is getting full. With a
complete Slackware installation, a whole year's worth of FTP
downloaded applications and KDE, my 1.5GB hard drive is only 25%
full.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1172580.0x12626a8"></a>Getting the Sources and Installation</h2></div></div><p>The KDE packages can be downloaded from the KDE web page. The
web page contains directions for installation. When you unpack the
source files, be sure to read the README and INSTALL files as
well.</p><p>Several mirror sites around the world provide optimum
download times. The packages are available in source and binary
RPM, source and binary .tgz and source and binary Debian.</p><p>The KDE team recommends RPM for the inexperienced UNIX user
whose system supports that format. My Slackware system did not, so
I had to compile the sources. Although this took about an hour, the
process was well-documented and I had no problems with the
installation. If you're compiling the sources yourself, here is a
tip that may help: decide on and create a &ldquo;kde root&rdquo; directory,
for example /usr/local/kde. Put your distribution files in
/usr/local and use <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> to unpack
them in that directory. All your compiled files and libraries will
end up under /usr/local/kde/, and any additional packages you
install later will be able to find the necessary libraries and
binaries.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1172580.0x12628b8"></a>Starting KDE the First Time</h2></div></div><p>Once KDE is properly installed, you must create a mechanism
to start it. On most Linux systems,
<span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> starts the X Window System
and then runs another script, /usr/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc. This
script is a link to one of several scripts that start the different
window managers such as FVWM, FVWM95, TWM, etc.</p><p>Edit the file that /usr/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc points to and
find the line that launches your old window manager. Comment out
that line and add a line under it to launch
<span   class="bold"><b>startkde</b></span>. The last few lines of
your file should look something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# extract from /usr/lib/X11/xinit/xinitrc.FVWM
if [ -f $usermodmap ]; then
 xmodmap $usermodmap
fi
# start some nice programs
xsetroot -solid SteelBlue
#FVWM &lt;-comment this out
startkde # &lt;-and add this!
</pre><p>Now, save this file and at the prompt, type
<b  >startx</b>. KDE should fire right up, greeting you
with a very impressive deep-blue desktop. Try the virtual desktop
selector on the bottom bar. It has four buttons, named one, two,
three and four. These switch between virtual desktops, each of
which has a different background. The background files are in .jpg
format and can be easily changed. I have some .jpg files containing
photos taken by the Hubble telescope, which make great backgrounds.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1172580.0x1262bd0"></a>Now Run Something</h2></div></div><p>Now that KDE is up and running, let's try doing something
with it. Put your cursor on the bottom bar icons, but don't click
anything. After a second or so, a label will pop up with the icon's
function. All the way to the right is the &ldquo;Terminal Emulation
(kvt)&rdquo; icon. <span   class="bold"><b>kvt</b></span>, or K virtual
terminal, is KDE's version of the xterm. Clicking once on this icon
will open up a kvt. Don't double-click&mdash;that would open two
kvts.</p><p>An interesting property of the kvt is that it is not by
default a login shell. In other words, none of the commands in any
of your login scripts will run when you open a kvt: no DIRCOLORs,
no aliases, no special environment variables. This is quite easy to
change if you desire. Simply click the right mouse button on the
kvt icon and open &ldquo;Properties&rdquo;. On the &ldquo;Permissions&rdquo; tab, make
sure you have the <b  >Read</b> and
<b  >Write</b> buttons pushed in for User. Then on the
&ldquo;Execute&rdquo; tab, Execute input area, the default command to run
is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
kvt -caption "%c" %i %m
</pre><p>To open kvt as a login shell, just add <b  >-ls</b>
so it now reads:
<pre     class="programlisting">
kvt -ls -caption "%c" %i %m
</pre>


Then click on &ldquo;OK&rdquo;. Your next kvt will open as a login shell. If
this doesn't work, shut down KDE and restart it as root. This time,
the modification will definitely work.
</p><p>After having set kvt up as a login shell, you may notice a
curious message on the first line of the kvt display that
reads:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/dev/ttyp2: Operation not permitted
</pre><p>Below this line will be your normal shell prompt. This
message can safely be ignored.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1172580.0x12630a0"></a>Create an Icon on the Desktop (Netscape)</h2></div></div><p>In all my years of running X, I never figured out how to open
FVWM with icons on the screen. A Netscape icon can be created with
KDE in about a minute and doesn't require reading man pages.</p><p>On the left border, open the &ldquo;Templates&rdquo; folder. Select
<b  >File</b>-&gt;New<b  >-&gt;</b>Program. In
the KFV dialog's &ldquo;General&rdquo; tab, change Program.kdelnk to
Netscape.kdelnk. In the &ldquo;Execute&rdquo; tab, type in the path to the
Netscape executable and specify an appropriate working directory.
Click on the icon that seems logical. Click <b  >OK</b>,
and you are done. (See Figure 2.) Remember, don't double-click on
the Netscape icon unless you want two browsers to open.</p><p><a href="3111f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Netscape Icon in KDE</b></span></a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1172580.0x1263410"></a>State Preservation at Shutdown</h2></div></div><p>With FVWM, several programs could be opened and iconified in
order to set up the desktop. Then, when FVWM exited, it all
disappeared and the next time FVWM was opened, all changes would
have to be redone. KDE opens in exactly the same state that you
leave it. To me, this is both logical and convenient.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1172580.0x1263518"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>What about KDE's drawbacks? So far, I haven't found anything
with KDE that I don't like or that is &ldquo;broken&rdquo;. It seems to be
solidly engineered and stable. I'm keeping it!</p><p>One objection to KDE is that it looks a lot like MS Windows
95. Once you use it for a while, though, you realize KDE is not
much like Windows 95 at all. It does have a silver bar along the
display bottom (and top), and icons on the left side. However,
every aspect of KDE's appearance is configurable; these are just
what come out of the box. Similarities to Windows 95 end at the
screen pixels.</p><p>Some have also said that KDE represents a moving away from
the low-level workings of the operating system. For many people,
this is actually good news. For the programmers and kernel hackers,
Linux is still underneath it all. I believe most will see KDE as a
breath of much needed fresh air. Recall what happened to OS/2&mdash;a
highly specialized operating system that catered strictly to
intellectuals.</p><p>The Linux community can't simply find a comfortable niche and
stay there forever. We are either attracting users or losing
them&mdash;not everyone is a kernel hacker or system programmer. If
Linux is to be a vibrant, mainstream, &ldquo;world dominant&rdquo; operating
system, it needs conveniences for the average user: straightforward
installation, good applications, good looks and ease of use. KDE is
a quantum step in this direction.</p></div></div>
