    This bundling
    deal is believed to be the first time for a major PC manufacturer
    to offer Linux preinstalled on desktop computers.

this column, I found one spurious rumor that Hitachi would be using
Linux and one true rumor that Pacific HiTech and Panasonic were
becoming partners. This is good news indeed for the Linux community
in general and for the Japanese community in particular. Our cover
is a Panasonic computer running Pacific HiTech's Linux in Japanese.
The following information was provided by Lonn Johnston and Craig
Oda of Pacific HiTech.
</p><p>Panasonic, one of the world's largest consumer electronic and
computer vendors, will be installing Pacific HiTech's TurboLinux
operating system on high-end Panasonic desktop computers. This
bundling deal is believed to be the first time for a major PC
manufacturer to offer Linux preinstalled on desktop
computers.</p><p>Pacific HiTech (PHT) is the largest Linux company in Japan
with more than 50 percent market share. In December 1998, PHT Linux
products outsold Microsoft's Windows NT in Japan, according to
Japan's Computer News, an industry analyst firm.</p><p>In March, PHT will announce two high-performance Linux server
products for the United States market for corporate Intranet and
Internet applications. It will also announce a high-end TurboLinux
product that will push Linux to new levels of mission-critical
deployment. PHT will back its products in the United States with
national support from one of the world's largest corporate call
centers and training companies. It already has this support
infrastructure well established in Japan.</p><p>Panasonic is already offering its 275,000 employees the
option of ordering their computers preinstalled with TurboLinux and
has quietly been shipping TurboLinux to corporate customers on
Panasonic computers since December 1998. Pacific HiTech will be the
exclusive supplier of the Linux operating system to
Panasonic.</p><p>The TurboLinux option will be offered on Panasonic desktop
computer models using Intel Pentium processors at 400 to 450MHz.
While the computers will be sold under the Panasonic brand, the
machines will actually be built by Proton under an OEM arrangement.
Proton, one of Japan's largest desktop manufacturers, is a
subsidiary of Ado Denshi, a high-technology Japanese company. The
units will initially be available only in Japan.</p><p>The Pacific HiTech and Panasonic deal is a key international
development, which will help drive Linux into the corporate
mainstream, both in Japan and the United States. Corporate chief
information officers have been deploying Linux in selected
applications for several years but have been reluctant to embrace
the upstart operating system throughout the information technology
infrastructure until support and other mission-critical issues have
been resolved. By bundling TurboLinux in volume preinstalled
desktop machines, Panasonic is addressing many of those issues and
bringing credibility to Linux as a viable corporate operating
system for the desktop, Internet and Intranet, as well as
mission-critical applications.</p><p>Pacific HiTech has a long list of software, hardware and
distribution partnership agreements with leading companies around
the world, including Oracle, Adaptec, Accton, Panasonic, Corel and
DDI, Japan's second largest telephone company.</p><p>PHT invests significant development resources in its
TurboLinux product suite to simplify installation and offer the
most stable, robust and powerful Linux operating system on the
market. PHT believes customers are better served by Linux as an
operating system of choice if they also receive commercial software
bundled with Linux. By offering Oracle bundled with TurboLinux, for
example, customers gain many benefits: easier installation,
performance improvements and one-stop support.</p><p>TurboLinux was chosen by Panasonic not just for its
technological advantages and Pacific HiTech's support
infrastructure, but also for its programming design that easily
accommodates languages other than English. TurboLinux is available
in three languages: English, Japanese and Chinese (more versions to
be announced). While most systems administrators around the world
have adopted English as the Lingua Franca of computing, there are
major advantages in administering systems using one's native
language. For less technical computing audiences, vendors have no
choice but to offer local language support. TurboLinux easily
accommodates different languages from installation and graphical
user interface all the way through to network administration tools.
It is a customer-friendly approach consistent with Linux as an
international operating system.</p></div></div>
