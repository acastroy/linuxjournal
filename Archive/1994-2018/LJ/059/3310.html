looking all over the web and have found no documents about
this. &mdash;Luis David Cardenas, luisdav@liza.net.mx</p><p>The answer will depend upon which kind of modem you have
(Plug-n-Play, winmodem etc.). If your modem has these switches
(also called jumpers), configure it to use an IRQ/Com (IRQ3, Com 2
for example) and simply create a link (as root) to it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /dev
ls -s /dev/cuaX /dev/modem
</pre><p>where the X is directly related to the Com port you
have chosen (Com1 = cua0, Com2 = cua1 and so on). If your modem is
Plug-n-Play, you will have to create an /etc/isapnp.conf file and
configure it accordingly. &mdash;Mario Bittencourt,
mneto@buriti.com.br

to see that my Internet connection no longer works. I set up my PPP
connection through Network Configurator. I have no problem dialing
and logging in, but when I pinged one of the sites, e.g.,
www.idl.net.au, I got this message:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ping: unknown host www.idl.net.au
</pre><p>Which is strange, because it used to work under 5.1. &mdash;Genesis
Elliott, genesis@mail.idl.net.au
</p><p>I suppose your ping is just a test and other things that used
to work also stopped working (I am saying that because DNS might
not be working, or the host you are pinging could have
disappeared&mdash;I have seen that happen). Let's suppose your problem
is truly linked to the upgrade. Make sure that /etc/resolv.conf
still has correct values
<b  >(netstat&nbsp;-nr;&nbsp;ifconfig)</b>, or else make
sure you cannot ping hosts by their IP addresses (rather than host
name). Then, if that fails, under interfaces/ppp/communication
check the debug box, and do a <b  >tail -f
/var/log/messages</b>. Bring the connection up, and the
messages from syslog in /var/log/messages should give you a clue as
to what is wrong. &mdash;Marc Merlin marc@merlins.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b36580.0x1c2e5b0"></a>Chinese Big-5 Display</h2></div></div><p>How do I display a Chinese charactered document under xterm

display Kanji under Linux, and it offers several ways to input
Chinese. Netscape can also be configured to display Mandarin in the
View/Encoding menu, both simplified Big5 encoded Kanji and
traditional Kanji as used in Taiwan.</p><p>You should read the Chinese Linux HOWTO

various options. Is there a way to do a sort of reverse lookup to
find out which options were picked at compile time? This is needed
in order to determine which options were compiled into a particular
kernel I have floating around but for which I don't have the
accompanying config file. &mdash;Ian Gilchrist,
ian.gilchrist@mail.com</p><p>This information is not saved as any type of text data
specifically, but if you are creative you can find other ways to
get this information. Each time Linux is compiled, a map file is
also created. It contains the function names in the kernel, and
with some work, you can probably figure out from there what you
need to know.</p><p>It is a good idea to save the .config file with each compiled
kernel. It has all the information you need; I often compress it
with <span   class="bold"><b>gzip</b></span> and save it in the
directory where I store my kernels. This is much handier than you
may think. There is nothing worse than trying to compile a kernel
for a two-year-old system with a really old LAN or SCSI card, when
you cannot remember how you got it to work the first time. &mdash;Chad
Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b36580.0x1c2ea28"></a>Accessing Home Pages via FTP</h2></div></div><p>We are a small ISP and have used Windows NT, WebTEN and
MachTEN for our services. We have now changed to Linux.</p><p>We have set up Linux, and we want our customers to be able to
use ftp to put their home pages on the server. This works fine, but
they also are able to go up the tree to see the /home/dir, and even
more, the whole hard drive. I want to change it so that they can go
into their /home/$USER and no further. I have tried to use the
<b  >guestgroup</b> option in /etc/ftpaccess to no
avail.</p><p>How do I do it? What is the proper syntax? Can anyone send me
a working line out of the /etc/ftpaccess and the /etc/passwd
file? &mdash;A.H.J. Mittendorff, gr0upe@technologist.com</p><p>The easier way is to create an FTP group (let's call it
ftponly) in /etc/group and change your creation script to add the
users with this group. Then edit your /etc/ftpaccess and add
<b  >guestgroup ftponly</b>. Now, if you try to log on
using ftp, you should be able to see only your directory. Note that
since FTP will <span   class="bold"><b>chroot</b></span> to the
user's directory, you will also have to add a /bin directory with a
statically linked <span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span>
version.</p><p>Also, check that your /etc/ined.conf has a line like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ftp stream tcp nowait root /usr/sbin/tcpd in.ftpd -l -a

have been unable to find an answer. How can I set up
<span   class="bold"><b>kermit</b></span> or Linux so that they can
talk to each other? I am trying to use ckermit 6.0.192 to dial a
pager, and I get the message &ldquo;Warning: terminal type unknown ...&rdquo;
each time I start up kermit.</p><p>Once I get to kermit and try to dial a number, I get the
error message &ldquo;unable to initialize modem&rdquo;. I have used
<span   class="bold"><b>minicom</b></span> to dial my modem and it
works fine, but the application (Big Brother) which uses the modem

I may be doing wrong. Here is my problem:</p><p>I am trying to install Red Hat on my machine, which currently
has Windows 95 on it. I have a 6.4GB hard drive and I have used
Partition Magic to free up about 2GB of space. Windows 95 is on
three partitions; one of those is an extended partition. I decided
to use Disk Druid to make the Linux partitions because I am not
totally familiar with <span   class="bold"><b>fdisk</b></span>. I
first made a root partition, which worked fine, but if I try to
create any other partitions, I get an error with unallocated
partitions and the reason is &ldquo;no free primary&rdquo;.</p><p>I don't really want to format my hard drive, but if it comes
to that, so be it. &mdash;Ben Barth, bebart@dave-world.net</p><p>You may only have four primary partitions on your hard drive.
If you need more, you can make an extended partition instead of a
primary. Under DOS, this is how logical drives are created. Linux
has no problem residing on an extended partition, so you should be
able to install it once you create the extended partition. Remember
that you will probably want to make two: one for the file system
and one for the swap space (usually about twice your system RAM in
size). &mdash;Chad Robinson, chadr@brt.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b36580.0x1c2f4d0"></a>Getting Started with Applications</h2></div></div><p>How do I run a new application or install it into X? For
instance, my Red Hat bundle had a CD with lots of software on it. I
used RPM to install Word Perfect 7.0. Now I have an /opt directory
with a /wp70 directory under it and a bunch of subdirectories under
it. Which one is the executable? What magic word or process am I
missing to make WP run? All the files seem to be there. This is the
first question I haven't figured out, and I have spent a lot of
time trying. My system is working great but this is just too
nebulous for me.  &mdash;Sean Wyatt, wyattcfi@compfuture.com</p><p>Usually, applications that install in /opt install a link to
their binary in /opt/bin. So, all you should need to do is put
/opt/bin in your PATH. In the /etc/profile file, you can
add:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
PATH=/opt/bin:$PATH
export PATH
</pre><p>Should the executable be absent from /opt/bin, you
can locate it using:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
find /opt/bin -follow -type f -perm -700
</pre><p>then create a link yourself and add whichever directory
it lies in, to your PATH. &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc@merlins.org

of:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe: cannot find net-pf-4
modprobe: cannot find net-pf-5
</pre><p>at various times. It does not seem to affect the behavior of
the system, but I would like to know what it means and what I
should do about it. &mdash;Frank McCabe, fgm@fla.fujitsu.com
</p><p><b  >net-pf-4</b> and <b  >net-pf-5</b>
refer to support for IPX and AppleTalk, respectively. You can avoid
the modprobe messages from appearing at boot time by including
aliases for each in /etc/modules.conf (or /etc/conf.modules), i.e.,
add these lines to the file if they are not already there:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
alias net-pf-4 off
alias net-pf-5 off
</pre><p>Most of this information can be found in
/usr/src/linux/Documentation and I would recommend becoming
familiar with the resources in this directory. Note: /usr/src/linux
is just a symbolic link to your current source tree of the Linux
kernel. &mdash;Andy Bradford, andyb@caldera.com
