day, I am always looking for the best way to solve different
problems. Recently, I was given the chance to apply a Linux
solution in a new market for us. A longtime Linux client asked me
what I'd recommend for a point-of-sale system. Of course, I knew if
he was asking me, he probably wanted a reliable solution based on
Linux. After a little searching on the Web, I found LinuxPOS from
Linux Canada, Inc. Their web site said LinuxPOS was still in beta
but a demo copy was available, so I downloaded it. The beta
installed easily and in a few minutes I saw the POS login screen. I
was impressed immediately.
</p><p>One of the strongest features of this program is its
client/server nature. Once the registers are up and running
properly, the server can actually be taken off-line for backups,
maintenance, hardware upgrades, etc. When the server is back
on-line, the registers synchronize with the server and the cashiers
never notice a thing. This type of configuration makes this
application great for remote stores where phone lines may not be
100% reliable.</p><p>LinuxPOS is the front end to a powerful Unidata-based program
called Retailer's Choice ($599 US), also from Linux Canada.
(UniData Server, $885 for a 3-user license, can handle up to six
lanes of POS.) RC can handle all the accounting and inventory needs
for a single store as well as multiple locations. Written as a
text-based application, RC is easy to navigate and simple to
understand. You can access it through an xterm window, the Linux
console or a terminal such as a PC with a modem. The report writer
is a real plus for managers who want to query the system for
specific reports not already available in RC.</p><p><a href="3287f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Screen
Shot</b></span></a></p><p>The server I set up to run the Unidata database is a Pentium
II 400 with 128MB of RAM and two 6.4GB Fujitsu hard drives, housed
in a RAID1 full bay enclosure from MicroPal Corporation
(http://www.MicropalCorp.com/). Backups are handled by a Seagate
DAT drive connected to an Advansys SCSI card. Red Hat 5.2 with iBCS
re-compiled handles the OS needs, since the database is not yet
native to Linux. Network connectivity is handled through a 10/100
Intel Pro NIC.</p><p>The registers also run Linux, of course. AMD K6 266
processors with 32MB RAM and a 2GB hard drive make up the
registers. Symbol scanners and Star printers were added to handle
the specific POS needs. I believe it is very important that any
Linux system sold includes some sort of reliable, fast backup and
restore process. These registers are no exception. With a floppy
disk in hand, a store manager can walk up to a crashed register and
restore it in five minutes while typing only one command. This type
of restore is possible due to the 100T network and
etherboot.</p><p>Another great feature of this system is its technical
support. Beside the on-site support provided by myself, the folks
at Linux Canada were always there, ready to solve any problems we
couldn't quickly fix on our own with the help of the manuals.
Support can be a tough thing for small companies to provide, since
so much effort is consumed in actually writing and enhancing a
great program&mdash;these folks have found the perfect balance.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3287f2.jpg"></div><p>While it appears that LinuxPOS can do everything a
storekeeper would want, there was one place where I had to find
another solution&mdash;employee time cards. Sure, you can have them
punch a card in and out every day, but with all this processing
power, there is a better way. At first I thought I had found it
through a great little application called TimeClock, but after
contacting them, I discovered they are having internal difficulties
and could not provide us with what we needed. So what's a good
Linux consultant to do? Simple; I wrote a series of scripts called
lxTimeClock (http://www.TexasComputers.com/) and released them
under the GPL, free to all. Support is very limited, but once you
get things installed, it really doesn't need much attention at all.
</p><p>With a little ingenuity and a few years of Linux experience,
I was able to deliver a strong, reliable solution without much
custom programming. Many people get stuck on how free Linux is and
toss a computer together from old or cheap parts. This is fine for
testing it out at home or in your office, but when it comes to
delivering solutions, quality parts make all the difference in the
world. So the next time someone asks you &ldquo;Can Linux do...?&rdquo;,
search the Web&mdash;the answer is most likely there. LinuxPOS was just
sitting out there waiting for a great opportunity like this
one.</p></div></div>
