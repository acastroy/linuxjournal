    If you need to graph data, there are two packages available
    for Linux under X: Gnuplot and Xmgr.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119a580.0x1292500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Graphing data is one of the oldest uses
for a computer, dating back to FORTRAN programs producing character
graphics on line-printers. Fortunately, things have advanced
somewhat, and modern computers are capable of producing much nicer
graphs. Several graphing packages are available for Linux under X
and SVGALIB. Two of the most prominent packages are gnuplot and
xmgr (a.k.a. ACE/gr). Xmgr is oriented towards graphing and
manipulation of externally produced data sets, while gnuplot is
used more for plotting data and mathematical functions.
</p><p>Gnuplot's primary authors are Thomas Williams and Colin
Kelley, with many others contributing. Although gnuplot was written
independently of the Free Software Foundation, the FSF does
distribute it. Gnuplot was written with portability in mind,
supporting about four dozen output devices and formats under a
dozen operating systems. Under Linux, it will run under both X and
SVGALIB. Modifying gnuplot to support a new device involves writing
a few device-dependent subroutines that are linked in with the main
program.</p><p>Xmgr, on the other hand, is tied to X. Developed by Paul
Turner, it also runs on many platforms besides Linux, but it
outputs only PostScript. In the latter stages of development, Linux
was the primary development platform. Development has recently been
spread around to a loose organization of interested people.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119a580.0x12926b8"></a>Gnuplot</h2></div></div><p>Gnuplot has a command-line interface with a mixture of emacs
and Unix command line editing similar to the bash shell. Gnuplot
may be run in batch mode, where the commands are taken from a file.
The <b  >plot</b> command causes a plot to be sent to the
currently selected device. In the case of the Linux svgalib driver,
a graphics mode is selected and a graph is drawn in the current
virtual console. When a key is hit, the display changes back to
text mode for an additional command. Under X, a new window is
created for the graph, while commands are entered in the original
shell window.</p><p>Gnuplot has a comprehensive on-line help facility that can be
accessed by typing <b  >help</b>. The basic help command
lists arguments of the help command by topic. Some subjects, like
the <b  >set</b> command, have many sub-topics. The
documentation itself is well written and has many valuable examples
of working commands.</p><p>A datafile containing points to plot is identified by the
file name in single or double quotes. Each line has a two or more
space-separated numbers that correspond to a point that is to be
plotted. For example, suppose we had a file named &ldquo;hits&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Monthly hits on our web site
1   13
2   23
3   66
4   75
5   74
6   82
7   377
8   442
9   512
10  756
11  874
12  946
</pre><p>The command <b  >plot "hits"</b> would plot a graph
of the data in the file named hits. Lines in a data file beginning
with a <b  >#</b> character are treated as comment lines.
Blank lines are not treated as comments. Instead, they indicate
where a line should not be drawn between a pair of points.</p><p>Although our example has the x data listed in the first
column and the y in the second, gnuplot can handle cases where this
is not so. The command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
plot "hits" using 2:1
</pre><p>would cause the x data to be read from the second column and
the y data from the first column.</p><p>Plots can be embellished in many ways. Each comma-separated
file or mathematical expression (shown later) to plot has two
attributes that can be specified by the user: a title and a style.
A gnuplot &ldquo;title&rdquo; is a string that is displayed with an example
of the plot style that labels that data; this is usually called a
&ldquo;legend&rdquo; by other programs. The style of the plot is selected
from several possible ones, including &ldquo;points&rdquo;, which displays a
symbol at each data point, &ldquo;lines&rdquo;, which draws lines between the
points, and &ldquo;linespoints&rdquo;, which draws both the lines and the
symbols. The color of the line and symbol as well as the type of
symbol (plus sign, cross, box) are normally assigned in series by
gnuplot to make each distinct, but these can be overridden by the
user.</p><p>For example, the command <b  >plot "hits" title 'Hits on
Website' with linespoints 3 4</b> plots our data file using
lines of type 3 and points of type 4. At the top right will be the
string <b  >Hits on Website</b> next to a short example
of type 3 lines and type 4 points. What you actually see depends on
the output device being used&mdash;lines that are colored on a color
display can come out dashed and dotted on monochrome devices (like
most PostScript printers).</p><p>Our plot is looking better, but it is still not perfect. We
want to put labels on the x and y axes to further clue the reader
in on what we are looking at. Axis labels are setable parameters,
as is the graph title:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set xlabel "Month"
set ylabel "Hits"
set title "Hits on the Website"
replot
</pre><p>Experimentation is easy to do in gnuplot by using the
<b  >replot</b> command, which repeats the previous plot
command. Not only does this save keystrokes, but the author has a
friend who likes to type <b  >replot</b> repeatedly to
display a file being appended to by another job he is running,
which gives a running display of results as they are
calculated.</p><p>Our graph is almost finished. Gnuplot's default algorithm for
deciding where the x tick marks appear is showing only every other
x point. We can make it show them all by:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set xtics 1, 1
replot
</pre><p>The first number causes the tick marks to start at x=1, and
the second causes them to be spaced one unit apart. We could have
included a third comma-separated parameter to indicate where the
last tick mark should be plotted, but it is unnecessary in our
example.</p><p>We can do better than month numbers:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set xtics ("Jan" 1, "Feb" 2, "Mar" 3, "Apr" 4,
    "May" 5, "Jun" 6, "Jul" 7, "Aug" 8, "Sep" 9,
    "Oct" 10, "Nov" 11, "Dec" 12)
replot
</pre><p>We have arrived at a graph worthy of being shown to the boss.
The result is shown in <a href="1218f1.html" target="_self">Figure
1</a>.</p><p>All that remains is to print it out. Gnuplot treats printers
and plotters as just another output device. Executing the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set terminal PostScript
</pre><p>tells gnuplot to generate PostScript of the graph instead of
console graphics. It is not enough to set the type of terminal.
Typing <b  >replot</b> now will cause gnuplot to spew
PostScript to the user terminal. The command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set output "graph.ps"
replot
</pre><p>will cause PostScript to be sent to the file graph.ps. If the
first character of the filename is a vertical bar, gnuplot
interprets the rest of the string as a program that will accept
gnuplot's output as its standard input. So a command like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set output "|lp"
replot
</pre><p>sends the output to the system's default printer.</p><p>Plots of mathematical functions are easy to produce:
<b  >plot 2*x</b> will produce a plot of a line with a
slope of two on the default range of -10.0 to +10.0. The y-axis is
automatically scaled by default so that all points are visible. For
a mathematical function, the x range is taken from a default range.
Multiple plots can be overlaid, with separate expressions separated
by a comma.</p><p>A wide variety of common mathematical functions can be used
in expressions&mdash;trigonometric, exponential and logarithmic as well
as less common functions such as bessel functions and error
functions. Expressions are based mostly on C-style expressions
including the logical AND (<b  >&amp;&amp;</b>) and OR
(<b  >||</b>) operators with the notable addition of the
FORTRAN power operator (<b  >**</b>).</p><p>Ranges are specified by a pair of numbers separated by a
colon enclosed in square braces. Either or both numbers may be
omitted to avoid affecting the current default. The first number
specifies the range to begin and the second specifies the end. If
we wanted to look at several graphs with the same range, the
default range can be changed with the command <b  >set xrange
[1:2]</b>. If we wanted to change the range in only one plot,
a range can be specified before the first function being
plotted.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119a580.0x12936e0"></a>Advanced Gnuplot</h2></div></div><p>Three dimensional surfaces can be generated with the
<b  >splot</b> command, which has syntax almost identical
to plot. An additional range specifies the range of the y variable
and the <b  >set view</b> command lets the user control
the orientation of the plot in space. A simple example would
be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
splot x*x-y*y title "Hyperbolic Paraboloid"
</pre><p>Gnuplot also supports hiding lines that are behind other
lines with the <b  >hidden3d</b> parameter: <b  >set
hidden3d</b>.</p><p>Gnuplot can plot &ldquo;parametric&rdquo; functions. A parametric
function is one in which both the x and y coordinates are functions
of a third variable, which in Gnuplot is t. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set parametric
plot 2*sin(t), 2*cos(t)
</pre><p>produces a circle of radius 2. The command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set trange &lt;range&gt;
</pre><p>sets the values of t that are evaluated. Parametric plots are
also valid while doing a three-dimensional splot. In this case, the
independent variables under gnuplot are u and v.</p><p>Gnuplot can also take data points from the standard output of
a Unix command specified on gnuplot's command line. This allows the
display of points generated from almost any source. The command
should be specified like a filename, preceded by a
<b  >&lt;</b> character.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119a580.0x1293c60"></a>Xmgr</h2></div></div><p>Xmgr is oriented more towards plotting data created from an
external source, as opposed to plotting a given mathematical
function. Xmgr normally reads files, but can also take input piped
from its standard input. Once data has been read into an xmgr set,
it can be displayed, scaled, and manipulated in many ways.</p><p>Xmgr also has an on-line help. When the &ldquo;help&rdquo; menu is
selected, xmgr runs your favorite HTML browser (Mosaic by default)
with the xmgr documentation as input. Several sites on the internet
have this page on-line. If you don't have a browser, you end up
having to read raw html. Having a program's documentation as a
hypertext document is quite nice, as you can jump from subject to
subject as well as being able to do text searches. A gallery of
graphs produced by xmgr is also included with the xmgr
distribution, which gives the user a visual look at the wide range
of effects possible with xmgr.</p><p>The first step in graphing some data is to read the data into
xmgr. The &ldquo;Read Sets...&rdquo; option under &ldquo;File&rdquo; produces a file
browser from which a file can be selected. Several types of data
can be read in, but the two column &ldquo;XY&rdquo; format is the most
common. The format of the data is much the same as in
gnuplot&mdash;individual points on lines by themselves separated by
spaces or tabs. Lines beginning with <b  >#</b> are also
considered comment lines, and lines without numeric data (like a
blank line) separate sets. Lines beginning with the
<b  >@</b> symbol can control the actions of xmgr
separately from the user.</p><p>Xmgr data sets are somewhat like registers, in that only a
fixed number are available (fixed at compile time), and they are
referred to by number. Once the data is in a set, it is displayed
immediately. The left hand side of the xmgr window contains a
number of buttons that provide shortcuts for various
operations.</p><p>Most of the shortcut buttons let the user change the
appearance of the graph interactively. A set of four arrow buttons
scrolls the data in all four directions&mdash;tick marks and tick labels
are automatically updated. The &ldquo;Z&rdquo; and &ldquo;z&rdquo; buttons allow
uniform zooming in and out. Arbitrary zooms in are accomplished by
using the magnifying glass button. This prompts the user for a
rectangle that becomes the new limits of the graph. A text line at
the top of xmgr's window constantly displays the current position
of the mouse, in the coordinates of the graph. A crosshair
extending the length and breadth of the window may be toggled to
help position the mouse within a pixel of the desired point.</p><p>The &ldquo;autoO&rdquo; button provides an autoscaling feature. The
cursor changes to a crosshair, which when clicked at some point
selects the set nearest to the clicked point. The graph is rescaled
such that all points in this set are visible. The &ldquo;autoT&rdquo; button
immediately rescales the tick marks that can get cramped while
doing a zoom.</p><p>Each data set has several attributes that control how the set
is displayed&mdash;which symbol is used for points, the color of the
symbol, whether the symbols are connected by lines or not, the
color and style of the lines, the legend associated with the data
set, and more. One rather packed menu controls all these
options.</p><p>The user has a great deal of control over how the graph is
displayed. Major and minor tick marks chosen by xmgr can be
overridden. Simple box and line graphics as well as text strings
can be drawn at arbitrary locations. All strings can be displayed
in a variety of fonts and sizes, with subscripts, superscripts and
some special characters available.</p><p>To repeat the earlier example using gnuplot,
<a href="1218f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2</a> shows the xmgr display
immediately after loading the hits file.
<a href="1218f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3</a> shows the symbols and
legends menu used to control the appearance of the set and the
set's legend respectively, while <a href="1218f4.html" target="_self">Figure
4</a> shows the results. <a href="1218f5.html" target="_self">Figure
5</a> shows us getting ready to fix the X-axis by replacing the
numbers with month names with the result in
<a href="1218f6.html" target="_self">Figure 6</a>.
<a href="1218f7.html" target="_self">Figure 7</a> is after the final
touch-up, adding a title, giving the Y-axis a name, getting rid of
the tenths digit in the tick labels and expanding the X-axis to
fill the entire bottom of the graph.
<a href="1218f8.html" target="_self">Figure 8</a> is the final PostScript
output.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119a580.0x128abd0"></a>Advanced Xmgr</h2></div></div><p>Once it is in an internal set, the data can be manipulated in
many ways. Sets may be edited, deleted, and saved. Arbitrary
mathematical functions can be typed in to transform one set to
another. Regression, sometime referred to as &ldquo;curve-fitting&rdquo;, can
be done on a variety of standard curves&mdash;polynomial, logarithmic
and exponential. Histograms can be created from sets with
user-definable bin widths. Many other mathematical operations are
supported. Individual data sets (as well as complete graphs) can be
saved and loaded.</p><p>Xmgr also allows the user to define &ldquo;regions&rdquo; entered as
polygons determined by mouse clicks. Data points within a region
can be extracted from data sets into other data sets or removed
from data sets. The regression options may also be set to operate
only on the inside or outside of a particular region.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x119a580.0x128ad30"></a>More Information</h2></div></div><p>Gnuplot has its own Usenet newsgroup, comp.graphics.gnuplot.
The current version is 3.5. Gnuplot can be downloaded from Gnu ftp
sites like prep.ai.mit.edu and its mirrors.</p><p>The gnuplot 3.5 distribution comes with a tutorial written in
LaTeX. The regular gnuplot documentation can be compiled into
several different formats, one of which is the on-line help file.
Other formats are a VMS .hlp file, a TeX document, nroff/troff
format and an .rtf rich-text format. A man page is also provided,
which talks about invocation options and X-resources that are
used.</p><p>The current version of xmgr is 3.01. Xmgr has a home page
located at
<a href="http://www.teleport.com/~pturner/acegr/index.html" target="_self">www.teleport.com/~pturner/acegr/index.html</a>.
FAQs, on-line documentation, source and binaries are there. Other
pages still have some dangling pointers to the old xmgr home page
at ogi.edu, where the mailing list is still hosted.</p></div></div>
