    If you've recently set up fvwm and are using the default
    system.fvwmrc, you'll find that clicking the left mouse
    button anywhere in the root window brings up a pop-up menu.
    Not all of those entries will be valid for your system.
    Here's how to change them.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16c7580.0x17bf500"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you've recently set up fvwm and are
using the default system.fvwmrc, you'll find that clicking the left
mouse button anywhere in the root window brings up a pop-up menu.
What you may also quickly discover, to your dismay, is that many of
these program items don't <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> anything, either
because the program doesn't exist or is incorrectly set up.
</p><p>Because of this, you'll probably want to remove these menu
entries. Also, sooner or later, you'll install programs that you'd
like to add to the pop-up menu. Or you may decide that you want to
reorganize the menu into categories, such as Editors, Graphics,
Viewers, Network Apps, and so forth. Whatever the reason,
configuring the pop-up menus is easy and a huge amount of fun. So
let's look at how it's done.</p><p>Suppose you do a lot of text-editing or programming and have
several editors you enjoy using. You now want to organize the
pop-up menu by program category and want to put all your favorite
editors under one pop-up sub-menu, called Editors.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity, we'll leave out a discussion of
using command line options for things such as geometry, foreground
and background colors, fonts, and so forth. We'll use fairly simple
examples and assume that you can go back later and customize the
command line options.</p><p>Be sure you've made a backup copy of your current
<span   class="emphasis"><em>working</em></span> version of .fvwmrc. After that, load
up your favorite editor and open the file used to define the pop-up
menus, .fvwmrc. This will include entries such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Popup "Applications"
  Title "Applications"
  Exec  "Wingz"     exec Wingz &amp;
  Exec  "Xmgr Plot" exec xmgr -g 780x730+362+3 &amp;
  Exec  "Ghostview" exec ghostview &amp;
  Exec  "Seyon"     exec seyon -modem /dev/modem &amp;
  Exec  "SciLab"    exec scilab &amp;
  Exec  "X3270"     exec x3270 &amp;
  Exec  "Xfilemanager" exec xfilemanager &amp;
  Exec  "Xfm"       exec xfm &amp;
  Exec  "Xgrab"     exec xgrab &amp;
  Exec  "Xxgdb"     exec xxgdb &amp;
EndPopup
</pre><p>Your .fvwmrc will probably look a bit different than this, so
find the section of the file that defines <b  >Popup
"<i><tt>name</tt></i>" ... EndPopup</b> stanzas.
Without fully understanding how things work, you could probably use
an entry such as the above as a template and modify the entries to
include the programs you want. What you'll discover, however, is
that this isn't hard to understand.</p><p>An important point to keep in mind is that you must define
sub-menus first, before you define the main menu. The reason for
this is actually quite simple: when fvwm starts it reads the
.fvwmrc configuration file from beginning to end. If you define the
main menu first, it encounters references to menu items (your
sub-menus) that haven't been defined yet, and so it is unable to
correctly set up the menus. Also, sub-menus can be nested to any
depth. Once you have a list of editors to add to a sub-menu, and
you've worked out the command line options you intend to use,
you're ready to start.</p><p>The basic entry for a menu takes the form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Popup "<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>"
  Title  "<span   class="emphasis"><em>title</em></span>"
  Exec  "<span   class="emphasis"><em>program</em></span>"  exec <span   class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> &amp;
  Exec  "<span   class="emphasis"><em>program</em></span>"  exec <span   class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> &amp;
  Exec  "<span   class="emphasis"><em>program</em></span>"  exec <span   class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> &amp;
  Nop   ""
  Exec  "<span   class="emphasis"><em>program</em></span>"  exec <span   class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> &amp;
  Exec  "<span   class="emphasis"><em>program</em></span>"  exec <span   class="emphasis"><em>command</em></span> &amp;
EndPopup
</pre><p>Let's briefly look at each part of the entry. The entry
begins with the word <b  >Popup</b> and a
<b  >"<i><tt>name</tt></i>"</b> which is used
to refer to this menu itself (we'll see how this is used in a
minute when we talk about adding a sub-menu to the main menu). The
next line, beginning with the word <b  >Title</b>,
specifies the title that appears at the top of the menu. Notice
that the title is enclosed in double quotes. Next are a series of
familiar <b  >Exec</b> stanzas, each of which is used to
launch a program. This time, however, the word following Exec and
enclosed in double quotes is the name that will appear on the menu.
A stanza for the xedit editor might look something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
  Exec "XEdit" exec xedit -font 9x15 -g +5+20 &amp;
</pre><p>The menu would then include an entry with the name XEdit:
clicking on this would launch the xedit program with the font and
geometry options that are specified on the command line. Don't
forget the ampersand (<b  >&amp;</b>) at the end of the
entry.</p><p>You'll also notice a line which begins with the word
<b  >Nop</b>, which, as its name suggests (to some
people, anyway), performs &ldquo;no operation&rdquo;. It does, however, allow
you to create separator lines between menu items.
<b  >Nop</b> followed by a pair of double quotes with
<span   class="bold"><b>no spaces between them</b></span>
(<b  >""</b>) creates a separator line. This is very
useful for visually separating a list of items in the menu.
However, if <b  >Nop</b> is followed by double quotes
<span   class="bold"><b>with a space between them</b></span>
(<b  >" "</b>), an empty entry is created between menu
items instead of a line. Try both and see the difference.</p><p>Finally, the reserved word <b  >EndPopup</b> is
used to indicate that the menu has been defined. Pretty simple, eh?
Once you understand how menus are defined, you can easily use an
existing menu definition as a &ldquo;template&rdquo; for creating one of your
own.</p><p>One more quick point to mention: it is possible to launch
fvwm modules from a pop-up menu. As with the
<b  >InitFunction</b> entries mentioned last month, these
are really quite simple and use the same form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Module  "<span   class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>"  <span   class="emphasis"><em>module</em></span>
</pre><p>For example, to start up the FvwmPager, you would add
something like the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Module  "Pager"  FvwmPager
</pre><p>Notice two things: the menu item name for the module can be
anything you want&mdash;it doesn't have to be the same as the module
name. Second, you do not put an ampersand
(<b  >&amp;</b>) at the end of the command line.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16c7580.0x17c0840"></a>Putting It All Together</h2></div></div><p>So, now that we've touched on the basics, let's put all of
this together and create a sub-menu for our editors. Supposing that
we wanted the menu title to be
<span   class="bold"><b>Editors</b></span> and the Popup itself to be
referred to as <b  >editors</b>, then we could create
something similar to the example given below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Popup "editors"
  Title "Editors"
  Exec  "XE&amp;dit"      exec xedit &amp;
  Exec  "X&amp;Coral"     exec xcoral &amp;
  Exec  "GNU &amp;Emacs"  exec emacs -g 84x47 &amp;
  Exec  "&amp;XEmacs"     exec xemacs &amp;
  Exec  "XW&amp;PE"       exec xwpe -font 9x15 &amp;
  Exec  "X&amp;WE"        exec xwe -font 9x15 &amp;
  Exec  "&amp;aXe"        exec axe -noserver &amp;
  Exec  "&amp;NEdit"      exec nedit &amp;
  Exec  "E&amp;Z Editor"  exec ez &amp;
EndPopup
</pre><p>So far so good, eh. What's that? What are those ampersands
doing in the menu item name entry? Fvwm allows you to define
keyboard shortcuts to use with menus. Placing an ampersand in an
item name causes the letter following the ampersand to be
underlined. Then, when the menu is displayed, hitting that
underlined letter causes the program item to be executed.</p><p>In the menu defined above, the letter &ldquo;d&rdquo; in XEdit would be
underlined and would appear as &ldquo;XEdit&rdquo;. Once the menu has been
displayed, hitting a &ldquo;d&rdquo; launches xedit. It goes without saying
that you should avoid defining the same hot-key for two items in
the name menu.</p><p>Ok, we're almost done. Now that we've created a sub-menu,
let's add this to the main menu. An entry for a sub-menu takes the
form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
  Popup  "Editors"  editors
</pre><p>Pretty easy, huh? The syntax should start to look pretty
familiar to you by now. The line begins with the word &ldquo;Popup&rdquo;
indicating the the item is a sub-menu of some kind. Following this,
and enclosed in double quotes, is the item name that will appear on
the menu. Finally, the last argument is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>name of the
pop-up menu itself</em></span>. Remember that we decided to call the
pop-up <b  >editors</b>? This is the name by which the
sub-menu is called. Be careful not to mix up the name of the pop-up
menu with the title (e.g., &ldquo;Editors&rdquo;) that the menu uses.</p><p>Well, congratulations! You should now be well on your way to
customizing and configuring. There are many more things that can be
included on a pop-up menu although programs, modules, and sub-menus
are probably the the ones you'll use the most. Once you get
comfortable creating menu entries, skim over the fvwm manual page
and take a look at the sample fvwmrc file that comes with the fvwm
distribution to get ideas about what else can be done.</p><p>As a final word of exhortation let me suggest that
&ldquo;moderation in all things&rdquo; is probably sage advice. It is
unnecessary and unwise to create an entry for every program on your
system. Add programs that you frequently use and make them
accessible. Nesting sub-menus beyond one or two deep is likely to
make getting at them more of a chore than it is worth. Also, more
than 15 to 20 items on a single menu will probably make it a bit
unwieldy. [Actually, experts in human-computer interaction suggest
that the human mind is less efficient when dealing with more than 7
items (or groups of items) together.  &mdash;ED] Use your discretion and
divide things up if you need to. Most of all, though, have
fun!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16c7580.0x17b75f8"></a>Color Customization</h2></div></div><p>By now you should start feeling pretty good about fvwm.
You've learned the basics of creating a start up desktop and you've
re-organized and customized your pop-up menus. This is pretty good,
eh? One of the next items on the customization to-do list is
invariably colors. Like most everything associated with fvwm,
colors are extensively customizable. Doing this, however, can be
just a bit tricky, not because it's all that difficult, but because
several entries govern how colors are applied to various programs
and windows. Once you track all of these down, and understand a few
simple concepts about how colors are defined, the rest is play. At
the outset, however, it is helpful to know something about how fvwm
views windows (no, not <span   class="bold"><b>that</b></span>
Windows...).</p><p>Fvwm recognizes and makes a distinction between a couple of
different &ldquo;types&rdquo; of windows. These include the &ldquo;selected&rdquo;
window&mdash;that which has the input focus&mdash;&ldquo;unselected&rdquo;
windows&mdash;those which do not have the input focus&mdash;and &ldquo;sticky&rdquo;
windows&mdash;those which &ldquo;stick to the glass&rdquo; as it were. It is
possible to customize the color scheme for each type of window.
Parenthetically, let me also point out that it is easy to change
the color of the root window or to use a bitmap or pixmap image in
the root window as the &ldquo;wallpaper&rdquo;. In Part 1 of this series we
saw that the xsetroot program allows you to change the color of the
root window (see the sample .xinitrc file). There are much more fun
and entertaining ways to change the root window, but I'll leave
that up to you for the moment (hint: <b  >man xpmroot</b>
and <b  >man xv</b> should give you some
ideas...).</p><p>So, back to customizing the various windows. Fvwm allows you
to individually customize selected, unselected, and sticky windows
as well as menus and the pager. These are set using the following
reserved words:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
StdForeColor
StdBackColor
StickyForeColor
StickyBackColor
HiForeColor
HiBackColor
MenuForeColor
MenuBackColor
MenuStippleColor
PagerForeColor
PagerBackColor
</pre><p>ForeColor stands for the foreground color and BackColor
stands for the background color. This is quite typical of how
colors are designated under X&mdash;using a foreground/background
combination to set the color scheme. A brief explanation of each of
these is as follows:</p><p><b  >StdForeColor</b> foreground color for menus
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>non-selected</em></span> window titles</p><p><b  >StdBackColor</b> background color for menus
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>non-selected</em></span> window frames</p><p><b  >StickyForeColor</b> foreground color for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non-selected sticky</em></span> window titles</p><p><b  >StickyBackColor</b> background color for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non-selected sticky</em></span> window frames</p><p><b  >HiForeColor</b> foreground color for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>selected</em></span> window's title</p><p><b  >HiBackColor</b> background color for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>selected</em></span> window frame</p><p><b  >MenuForeColor</b> foreground color for
menus</p><p><b  >MenuBackColor</b> background color for
menus</p><p><b  >MenuStippleColor</b> color for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>shaded-out entries</em></span> in a menu</p><p><b  >PagerForeColor</b> foreground color for
pager</p><p><b  >PagerBackColor</b> background color for
pager</p><p>Setting up the color scheme you want is a matter of adding an
entry such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
StdForeColor    black
StdBackColor    wheat
</pre><p>This would set the foreground (text) color to black and the
background color to wheat.</p><p>Armed with this new knowledge, you head off to customize
colors, and find an entry that looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
StdBackColor    #8a4510
</pre><p>If you're having a little trouble closing your eyes and
visualizing just what the color #8a4510 might look like... ...keep
reading.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16c7580.0x17b8570"></a>Xcolorsel to the Rescue!</h2></div></div><p>The color designated by the entry #8a4510 (which, for the
curious, happens to be SaddleBrown) is in hexadecimal notation. As
of X11 Release 5, there are several means for specifying color: two
commonly used formats are RGB color names (such as SaddleBrown) and
RGB hexadecimal values (such as #8a4510). The acronym RGB stands
for &ldquo;Red, Green, Blue&rdquo; and has to do with how colors are
generated.</p><p>Recall from your school days that all colors can be produced
by a combination of primary colors&mdash;cyan, magenta, and yellow.
Technically speaking, these are the &ldquo;subtractive&rdquo; primary colors
of paint; when you put them all together, they subtract
<span   class="bold"><b>all</b></span> the light and make &ldquo;black&rdquo;
(it really turns out brown). It is also possible to create colors
using a combination of red, green, and blue &ldquo;additive&rdquo; primary
colors of light&mdash;when you put them all together, they add up to
make white. Hence, the RGB designation indicates the amount each of
red, green, and blue light which make up a color. To see what
colors are available to you under X, you can view the file
/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt. This file contains a listing of all of the
named colors on your system. This might contain a listing such
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
...
139  69  19             saddle brown
139  69  19             SaddleBrown
160  82  45             sienna
205 133  63             peru
222 184 135             burlywood
245 245 220             beige
245 222 179             wheat
...
</pre><p>Each line contains the color name and three columns of
numbers which represent the relative contribution of red, green,
and blue values based on a scale from 0-255&mdash;the range of numbers
that can be stored in 8 bits, or one byte. Pretty clever, eh? For
reference sake, white contains the maximum value of red, green, and
blue and has a value of 255, 255, 255. Black is defined as 0, 0, 0.
This still doesn't answer the question of what #8a4510 looks like,
until you know a bit about hexadecimal.</p><p>The hexadecimal system uses a base 16 place order system with
&ldquo;digits&rdquo; including the numbers 0-9 and the letters a-f
(representing decimal values 10-16). Knowing that an RGB
designation must have an entry for each of the base colors, you can
quickly surmise that by breaking 8a4510 into three hexadecimal
numbers and converting them to decimal, that you could find their
value in the rgb.txt file above (which uses decimal values for the
red, green, and blue values). Converting from hex to decimal by
hand isn't very difficult, but here's an even easier way to do
it:</p><p>Enter <b  >bc</b> at the command line to start the
bc online calculator, and enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ibase=16
</pre><p>This sets the input to base 16 (hexadecimal). Now, enter the
numbers that you want to convert to decimal separated by a
semicolon:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
8A;45;10
</pre><p>You <span   class="bold"><b>must</b></span> use capital letters
for hexadecimal input. The output should look something
like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
138
69
16
</pre><p>Do ctrl-D or type <b  >quit</b> to exit bc.</p><p>Thus, the red value is 138, green is 69, and blue is 16.
Going back to the sample rgb.txt entry above, we can see that this
is very close to the entry for SaddleBrown (the blue value in
rgb.txt is 19 instead of 16) and this is, in fact, what our color
turns out to be.</p><p>Now, if all of this seems needlessly complex, rest assured
that there are easier ways of viewing and handling colors under X.
There are a few must-have configuration utilities that make using
and customizing X-Windows a lot easier, and a color viewer such as
xcolorsel is one of these. You should be able to find a copy of
this very useful program at sunsite.unc.edu (or preferably one of
the mirror sites) in the /pub/Linux/X11/xutils/colors/ directory.
This very handy program:</p><p>1. Shows a color patch and the rgb.txt entry for each
color.</p><p>2. Displays the color entry in any of 16 different formats,
including the hexadecimal notation we've just looked at.</p><p>3. Lets the user &ldquo;grab&rdquo; a color off the desktop and
displays the rgb entry that most closely matches it.</p><p>4. Lets the user &ldquo;preview&rdquo; what a certain
foreground/background color combination might look like using its
<b  >Set foreground</b> and <b  >Set
background</b> features.</p><p>When you start up xcolorsel, you are initially presented with
a display window containing color patches, their corresponding rgb
values in decimal notation, and the color name&mdash;just as they appear
in the rgb.txt file. Clicking on the <b  >Display
format</b> button presents you with a menu of different
formats&mdash;choosing <b  >8 bit truncated rgb</b> from this
menu lets you view SaddleBrown with its rgb hex value of #8a4510!
So, now you can easily see what each color name looks like and, if
you're curious, what the hexadecimal notation would be. Thus, the
following entries are equivalent:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
StdForeColor    SaddleBrown
StdForeColor    saddle brown
StdForeColor    #8a4510
</pre><p>Keep in mind that hexadecimal notation requires the pound, or
hash sign (<b  >#</b> ) prefix.</p><p>Use the <b  >Grab color</b> feature to quickly find
out what a color's rgb entry is. To do this click on the
<b  >Grab color</b> button&mdash;the cursor will change to a
small magnifying glass. Then, position the cursor over any color on
your desktop and click once; xcolorsel will display along the
bottom status line how many matches or near-matches there are and
will highlight the closest entry in the color display
window.</p><p>Finally, if you want to see what a particular
foreground/background color combination might look like, try this:
using the mouse pointer, highlight a color you want to use as
either the foreground or background color and then hit either the
<b  >Set foreground</b> or <b  >Set
background</b> buttons at the bottom. The foreground or
background colors of the color display window will then be changed
to this value. Hitting the <b  >Default colors</b> button
reverts the window to its original color scheme.</p><p>Now that you've got a bit of a feel for how colors are
defined, you can easily create your own customized &ldquo;window
treatments&rdquo;. However, if you've made changes, started up fvwm, and
things still aren't <span   class="emphasis"><em>quite</em></span> the way you'd
expected, there still a couple more things you need to know
about...</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16c7580.0x17b9388"></a>A Word about Styles</h2></div></div><p>One powerful feature of fvwm is that it allows the user to
define Styles for any or all applications. The idea is actually a
fairly simple one: you can designate how an application window
appears and several of its behaviors by setting up a style for it.
This can include such things as whether it has a title bar, the
size of the window border, whether it has resize handles, what icon
it is associated with, and so forth. One such style option, as you
might imagine, is color.</p><p>The syntax for a Style entry is actually quite simple and
might look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Style "xterm"  Title, Handles, HandleWidth 7, Icon rxterm.xpm
</pre><p>That is, it begins with the word Style and is followed by the
name of the program enclosed in double quotes&mdash;in this example, the
xterm program. What follows is a comma-separated list of the
various style options that you may wish to apply to the
program.</p><p>Let's suppose you wanted to change the color of an
application window to a simple black text on gray background.
Simple enough, although it's important to make two points: first,
the Styles color entry only sets the colors of the decorative
window frames that fvwm puts around the program window&mdash;it doesn't
change the colors of the application itself. Second, the colors are
used when the window is <span   class="emphasis"><em>non-selected</em></span> (that is,
it doesn't have the input focus). When the window is selected, the
HiForeColor / HiBackColor combination set the color scheme. That
said, to change the color scheme when the application window is
non-selected you could add an entry such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Style "xterm"  Color black/gray, Title, Handles, Icon rxterm.xpm
</pre><p>The syntax is simply the reserved word Color followed by the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>foreground</em></span> color name or hex number, a forward
slash, and the <span   class="emphasis"><em>background</em></span> color name or hex
number. You could also designate each color using the reserved
words ForeColor and BackColor:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Style "xterm"  ForeColor black, BackColor gray, Icon rxterm.xpm
</pre><p>Either method will work.</p><p>One more quick point about modules and we're done! As
previously mentioned, fvwm allows additional functionality to be
added using modules such as FvwmPager or the GoodStuff modules. The
foreground and background colors of the modules themselves (and not
just the decorative window frames as we've been discussing up until
this point) can be set using an entry such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*GoodStuffFore    black
*GoodStuffBack    turquoise
</pre><p>Configuration lines for modules must begin with the asterisk
(<b  >*</b>) character, as seen in the example above. To
specify the foreground color the module name is given with the
<b  >Fore</b> suffix. The background color designation
uses the <b  >Back</b> suffix. In the example above you
can see we've changed the color combination to black text on a
turquoise background. Again, you can use either the color name or
the hexadecimal notation for specifying the color to use.</p><p>Well, that should get you going! Obviously, there is a
<span   class="bold"><b>lot</b></span> more to color customization
than the brief overview presented here. For the curious and
adventurous, let me refer you to the manual pages for X and fvwm,
and the excellent book <span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Windows System Administrator's
Guide</em></span> (volume 8 in the X-Windows series) by O'Reilly
&amp; Associates publishing. Chapter 6 of this fine reference has a
fuller discussion of color and the X-Windows system, including the
X-Windows Color Management System (Xcms) that was implemented
beginning with release 5. Enjoy!</p></div></div>
