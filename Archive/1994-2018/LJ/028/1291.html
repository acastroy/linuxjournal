    Open up your Unix toolbox and you will see a complete set of

    separate, simultaneous processes and direct their input and

Paradigm</b></span> is described (by me at least) as taking some of
a true operating system's most beautiful characteristics and
bending, twisting, folding, spindling, and mutilating them into
obscenely obtuse and imperfect tools. That these characteristics
can be bent, twisted, etc., and still work is, of course, what
gives them their beauty.
</p><p>Open up your Unix toolbox (/usr/bin for you gnubies), and you
will see a complete set of tools, ready for use. Much as the
discovery of a basic technology distinguishes one epoch of human
history from another, redirection and job control under Unix create
a golden age of computing in contrast to the iron-age toils of
MS-DOS. Because of the simple ability to differentiate separate,
simultaneous processes and direct their input and output at your
discretion, there are few limits to the ways in which you can use
these tools to assemble simple Unix processes. This ability, and
the will to use it, constitute the shell paradigm.</p><p>But where power resides lies danger. How much
<b  >|</b> <b  >&amp;</b> and
<b  >popen()</b> can a single process take before it
disintegrates into a heap of intractable spaghetti code? How many
different programming contexts can we use before our simple program
hurtles out of control towards the nether-regions of &ldquo;Kernel
Panic: Out of memory&rdquo;? [A lot&mdash;ED]</p><p>This article will describe to you how to mix and match I/O
streams to and from executables in different environments. If you
are hacking a Perl script and want to throw a little
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> in for good measure, go right
ahead; it's possible. Finally, we will discuss the limits to and
wisdom of these techniques.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249d580.0x25958c8"></a>The Shell</h2></div></div><p>The capability to have processes communicate easily among
themselves is inherent in the design of Unix systems, so the
appellation &ldquo;shell paradigm&rdquo; is somewhat of a misnomer.
Nonetheless, the shell is the context in which most people are
familiar with I/O redirections, so we will start there. As we will
later see, all these facilities can be easily recreated in places
other than at the shell prompt.</p><p>There are several ways to use process redirection within the
shell. You can take the output of a process and direct it to a
file, for example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd ~; ls &gt; /tmp/ls.file
</pre><p>Alternatively, you can append output to existing
files:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd ~/bin; ls &gt;&gt; /tmp/ls.file
</pre><p>You can also take the output of a process and redirect it as
the input of another process:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd ~; ls | grep lj.article
</pre><p>Within most shells, including the Bourne-compatible bash and
zsh, you can integrate the output of your command within other
commands. For example, if you wanted to generate a file with
yesterday's time appended to the end, you could do the
following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
touch /usr/acct/atlanta/data.`
  date --date '1 day ago' +"%Y%m%d"
 `
</pre><p>which just generated a file named data.19960503 for me. What
you get depends on how quickly you read your <i  >Linux Journal</i>. It also depends on which free OS you are
running; FreeBSD's version of date does not offer the <b  >1
day ago</b> facility, so you will have to get and compile
gnu-date if you are silly enough not to run Linux (or if your
employer uses FreeBSD.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249d580.0x2595d98"></a>C</h2></div></div><p>External-command inclusion is nice in C when you need a
function already implemented as a Unix tool which you don't want to
recode. For example, if you need to sort a stream of data or
compress an output file, using
<span   class="bold"><b>sort</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>gzip</b></span> rather than coding it
natively is an efficient way to accomplish the task. There are two
ways to use external programs under C: <b  >system()</b>
and <b  >popen()</b>.</p><p>If you have a large amount of data in strings that you want
to sort using the <span   class="bold"><b>sort</b></span> program,
you can use <b  >popen()</b> to call the sort program,
sort the data and read the result back from the program. If you
just want to compress a file, you can use the simpler
<b  >system()</b> function. Neither function is
unfamiliar to a C programmer, but if either is unfamiliar to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>, Look in the Linux man pages, where they
are documented. If you want more explanation, you can read
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment</em></span>,
by W. Richard Stevens.</p><p>However, if you need to <span   class="emphasis"><em>interact</em></span> with
the program you call, it is possible to do this with a C library
that comes with a tool called &ldquo;Expect&rdquo;, which is described later
in the Tcl section.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249d580.0x25962c0"></a>Mother of Perl</h2></div></div><p>Whereas there are a number of different ways to manipulate
process I/O within the shell, there is really only one within Perl:
as a filehandle. This is actually a testimony to the beauty of
Perl's design; kudos to Larry Wall for making it so simple.</p><p>You can include other processes from within Perl in several
different manners, all with the <b  >open ()</b> command.
For example, if you wanted to open a process
<span   class="bold"><b>bottle</b></span> to which the output of your
Perl script should be sent, you would use</p><pre     class="programlisting">
open (BOTTLE, "| ~&lt;bin/bottle"
</pre><p>to direct the output. Similarly, if you wanted to read the
input of bottle, you would do much the same thing, adding the pipe
symbol (<b  >|</b>) at the end:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
open (BOTTLE, "~&lt;bin/bottle |")
</pre><p>In the first case, you could only write to filehandle bottle,
whereas in the second case, you could do nothing but read.</p><p>Commands opened in this manner can also get fancy. Everything
within the quotation marks is executed from within a subshell, so
commands like either of the following will work:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
open (BOTTLE, "cd ~; /bin/bottle |")
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
open (FIND, "cd /home/tlewis; find . -name $string -print |")
</pre><p>At this point many people ask, &ldquo;What if I want to do both
reading and writing?&rdquo; You can't do this with the <b  >open
()</b> command, so Perl is broken, right? No, not really. The
fact that you can't easily open a two-way pipe is a design
decision. As explained in the Unix FAQ:</p><p>The problem with trying to pipe both input and output to an
arbitrary slave process is that deadlock can occur, if both
processes are waiting for not-yet-generated input at the same
time.</p><p>Again, it is possible to do this with Expect, as we'll see
later.</p><p>A short example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/Perl
open (ACCT, "(cd /usr/acct/;".
  "for i in `ls | grep -v admin`; do; ".
  "cat $i/date.19960503; done) | sort |");
while (&lt;ACCT&gt;) {
     chop;
     ($A,$B,$C) = split;
     print "$C $A $B\n";
}
</pre><p>This would take the data in a limited subset of the
/usr/acct/ directory, sort it based on the first entry in each line
of each file, reformat the data and print it to standard output. By
mixing Perl and shell tools, this job becomes a lot easier.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249d580.0x25969f8"></a>Tcl/Tk</h2></div></div><p>Tcl is a simple scripting language designed as a command
language which could easily be applied to various C programs for
smooth configuration and user interaction. Tk is a language which
grew out of Tcl in which graphical user interfaces can be
constructed. One usually refers to them together as Tcl/Tk.</p><p>Tk has gained much popularity recently as an extremely easy
way to construct graphical interfaces under X-Windows. If you have
used <b  >make xconfig</b> when compiling any of the
recent (since 1.3.60) development kernels, you have used Tk. The
program Tkined, a network management tool for Linux, uses Tk; it is
based on Scotty, a Tcl extension offering various network functions
such as access to SNMP data.</p><p>In accordance with its original design goals, Tcl allows you
to interact with external processes in a fairly intuitive manner.
Simple commands may be executed under Tcl with a simple
<b  >exec</b> command. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
exec ls | grep -v admin
</pre><p>returns exactly the same result as it did in the previous
Perl example, but prints it to standard output, much like the
<b  >system()</b> command in C.</p><p>If you wish to interact with the output of a process or
direct information to its input, you need to associate it with a
filehandle, much as in Perl. This is done via the
<b  >open</b> command, as in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set g0 [open |sort r+]
</pre><p>This opens the command <span   class="bold"><b>sort</b></span>
for input. You would send data to the handle <b  >g0</b>
elsewhere in the program using <b  >puts</b> and then
read from the output using <b  >gets</b>. The
<b  >r+</b> switch means that you can both write data to
the process (data to be sorted) and read data from the process
(sorted data). If you just wanted the data to be sent to standard
output, you would use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
set g0 [open |sort w]
</pre><p>giving you write access to the process.</p><p>Wait, you say, this means that I can both read and write from
a process? Yes, it does. Doesn't the Unix FAQ say this is a bad
thing? Yes, it does. If you use this functionality to construct
webs of interlocking, self-feeding processes, then you are
<span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> asking for trouble. Keep it simple if
you are going to do this at all.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249d580.0x258da70"></a>Expect</h2></div></div><p>While it is potentially dangerous, people went so wild over
this feature of Tcl that an extension to Tcl called Expect, a
programming environment in its own right, was invented and has
soared to new heights of popularity among certain users.</p><p>For example, ftp is a fairly simple program. You interact via
a command line with a local program which then executes your
commands. Because this uses the simple Unix STDIN/STDOUT method of
interaction, you can write shell scripts to ftp files; I use such a
script to retreive RFCs from the Internet automatically. However, a
program like telnet is virtually impossible to script because you
are not sending data to the program itself&mdash;you are sending data
through a network connection to be interpreted on a remote machine.
So, if you need to maintain a large number of routers, and if the
only way to configure or check on these routers is via telnet, you
are in trouble.</p><p>Expect solves this problem by using Unix's pseudo-tty
mechanism. With Expect, you can script dialogues between your
program and another one in which your program responds
intelligently to the other. Think of a dialer program like dip or
chat, except you can script dialogues with other programs instead
of modems.</p><p>Expect is the height of inter-program communication, short of
socket-based or sysV-ipc. (If you don't know, don't ask.) While it
originally started as a Tcl extension, it has also been rendered
into a C library; you can access its features from within C
programs or from other environments which can use C libs, such as
Perl.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249d580.0x258dc80"></a>Smooth Sailing, But Rocks Ahead</h2></div></div><p>In the introduction to his book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit</em></span>, John Ousterhout mentions that even though Tcl
was originally designed to be a simple scripting language where all
programs would have at least &ldquo;some new C code&rdquo;, the simplicity of
the environment which they gave the programmer proved too enticing.
&ldquo;Most Tcl/Tk users never write any C code at all,&rdquo; Ousterhout
writes, &ldquo;and most Tcl/Tk applications consist solely of Tcl
scripts.&rdquo;</p><p>This is either a good or a bad thing, depending on whether
your criteria are ease-of-use or efficiency/power. Responding to
the rise of Tcl in his typically understated manner, GNU Luminary
and urban legend Richard Stallman posted a USENET article entitled
&ldquo;Why you should not use Tcl&rdquo;:,</p><p>Tcl was not designed to be a serious programming language. It
was designed to be a &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo;, on the assumption that
a &ldquo;scripting language&rdquo; need not try to be a real programming
language. So Tcl doesn't have the capabilities of one.</p><p>The ability to interact with other programs in new,
unorthodox and some would say dangerous ways is what makes Tcl so
appealing to some and so appalling to others. This is typical of
the dilemma in using Unix tools from within non-shell
programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x249d580.0x258dee8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>It usually comes down to a matter of time. If you're trying
to enter your code in the country fair, these techniques aren't
going to win you a blue ribbon. If, however, you want to get it
done by 7 PM so you can go to the fair, these might do the
trick.</p><p>In an age of near-gigaflops-speed chips in home computers, a
few wasted cycles here and there aren't going to kill anyone,
especially for a program that will be run once or twice and then
thrown away. Extending the shell philosophy to development work is
also an attractive option&mdash;the speed with which you can hack
together workable programs makes these techniques alluring to
programmers on a tight deadline. Tcl/Tk is a perfect example of
extending the shell philosophy to speed up development cycles. Of
course, the inefficiencies of this approach are the cause of nearly
all of the intense debate over the merits of Tcl/Tk.</p><p>Whether it be Tcl, shell, Perl, or C, no matter what your
programming technique of choice might be, there is usually an
option whereby tools from other programming environments can be
imported for your use. If Richard Stallman writes you a nasty
letter criticizing you for it, though, don't say you weren't
warned.</p></div></div>
