    As your shell
    scripts get more complex, you'll need to put a directive at the
    beginning to tell the operating system what sort of shell
    script this is.

lpr weekly.report
Mail boss &lt; weekly.report
cp weekly.report /floppy/report.txt
rm weekly.report
</pre><p>You found yourself repeating the same few commands over and
over: print out your weekly report, mail a copy to the boss, copy
the report onto a floppy disc, and delete the original. So it was a
big time saver when someone showed you that you can place those
commands into a text file (&ldquo;dealwithit&rdquo;, for instance), mark the
file as executable with <b  >chmod +x dealwithit</b>, and
then run it just by typing its filename.</p><p>But you'd like to know more. This script you've written is
not very robust; if you run it in the wrong directory, you get a
cascade of ugly error messages. And the script is not very flexible
either&mdash;if you'd like to print, mail, backup, and delete some other
file, you'll have to create another version of the script. Finally,
if someone asks you what kind of shell script you've
written&mdash;Bourne? Korn? C shell?&mdash;you can't say. Then read
on.</p><p>Last question first: what kind of shell script is this?
Actually, the script above is quite generic. It uses only features
common to all the shells. Lucky you. As your shell scripts get more
complex, you'll need to put a directive at the beginning to tell
the operating system what sort of shell script this is.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
</pre><p>The <b  >#!</b> should be the first two characters
of the file, and the rest should be the complete pathname of the
shell program you intend this script to be run by. Astute readers
will note that this line looks like a comment, and, since it begins
with a <b  >#</b> character, it is one, syntactically.
It's also magic.</p><p>When the operating system tries to run a file as a program,
it reads the first few bytes of the file (its &ldquo;magic number&rdquo;) to
learn what kind of file it is. The byte pattern
<b  >#!</b> means that this is a shell script, and that
the next several bytes, up to a newline character, make up the name
of the binary that the OS should really run, feeding it this script
file.</p><p>Paranoid programmers will make sure that no spaces are placed
after the executable name on the <b  >#!</b> line. You
are paranoid, aren't you? Good. Also, notice that running a shell
script requires that it be read first; this is why you must have
both read and execute permission to run a shell script file, while
you need only execute permission to run a binary file.</p><p>In this article, we will focus on writing programs for the
Bourne shell and its descendants. A Bourne shell script will run
flawlessly not only under the Bourne shell, but also under the Korn
shell, which adds a variety of features for efficiency and ease of
use. The Korn shell itself has two descendents of its own: the
POSIX standard shell, which is virtually identical to the Korn
shell; and a big Linux favorite, the Bourne Again shell. The Bourne
Again shell (&ldquo;bash&rdquo;) adds mostly interactive features from the
descendants of the C shell, Bill Joy's attempt to introduce a shell
that would use C-like control structures. What a great idea! Due to
a few good reasons, most shell programming has followed the Bourne
shell side of the genealogical tree. But people love the C shell's
interactive features, which is why they too were incorporated into
the Bourne Again shell.</p><p>Let me rephrase: do not write C shell scripts. Continue to
use the C shell, or its descendant tcsh, interactively if you care
to; your author does. But learn and use the Bourne/Korn/bash shells
for scripting.</p><p>So here is our shell script now:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
lpr weekly.report
Mail boss &lt; weekly.report
cp weekly.report /floppy/report.txt
rm weekly.report
</pre><p>If we run this script in the wrong directory, or if we
accidentally name our file something other than &ldquo;weekly.report&rdquo;,
here's what happens:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lpr: weekly.report: No such file or directory
./dealwithit: weekly.report: No such file or directory
cp: weekly.report: No such file or directory
rm: weekly.report: No such file or directory
</pre><p>and we get a bunch of &ldquo;Permission denied&rdquo; messages if we
run the script when the permissions on the file are wrong. Bleah.
Couldn't we do a check at the beginning of the program, so that if
something is wrong we can avert all these ugly messages? Indeed we
can, using (surprise!) an <b  >if</b>.</p><p>It occurs to us that if <b  >cat weekly.report</b>
works, so will most of the things our script wants to do. The
shell's if statement works just as this thought suggests: you give
the if statement a command to try, and if the command runs
successfully, it will run the other commands for you too. You also
can specify some commands to run if the first command&mdash;called the
&ldquo;control command&rdquo;--fails. Let's give it a try:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
if
    cat weekly.report
then
    lpr weekly.report
    Mail boss &lt; weekly.report
    cp weekly.report /floppy/report.txt
    rm weekly.report
else
  echo I see no weekly.report file here.
fi
</pre><p>The indentation is not mandatory, but does make your shell
scripts easier to read. You can put the control command on the same
line as the if keyword itself.</p><p>This new version works great when there's an error. We get
only one &ldquo;No such file or directory&rdquo; message, an improvement over
four, and then our helpful personalized error message appears. But
the script isn't so hot when it works: now we get the contents of
weekly.report dumped to the screen as a preliminary. This is, after
all, what cat does. Couldn't it just shut up?</p><p>You may know something about redirecting input and output in
the world of Unix: the <b  >&gt;</b> character sends a
command's output to a file, and the <b  >&lt;</b>
character arranges for a command to get its input from a file, as
in our Mail command. So if only we could send the cat command's
output to the trash can instead of to a file... Wait! Maybe there's
a trash can file somewhere. There is: /dev/null. Any output sent to
/dev/null dribbles out the back of the computer. So let's change
our cat command to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat weekly.report &gt;/dev/null
</pre><p>Because you are paranoid, you may be wondering whether
sending output to the trash can will affect whether this command
succeeds or fails. Since /dev/null always exists and is writable by
anyone, it will not fail.</p><p>Now our script is much quieter. But when cat fails, we still
see the</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat: weekly.report: No such file or directory
</pre><p>error message. Why didn't this go into the trash can too?
Because error messages flow separately from output, even though
they usually share a common destination: the screen. We redirected
standard output, but said nothing about errors. To redirect the
errors, we can:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat weekly.report &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null
</pre><p>Just as <b  >&gt;</b> means &ldquo;Send output here,&rdquo;
<b  >2&gt;</b> means &ldquo;Send errors here.&rdquo; In fact,
<b  >&gt;</b> is really just a synonym for
<b  >1&gt;</b>. Another, terser way to say the above
command is this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat weekly.report &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre><p>The incantation <b  >2&gt;&amp;1</b> means &ldquo;Send
errors (output stream number 2) to the same place ordinary output
(output stream number 1) is going to.&rdquo; By the way, this
<b  >2&gt;</b> jazz only works in the Bourne shell and
its descendants. The C shell makes it annoying to separate errors
from output, which is one of the reasons people avoid programming
in it.</p><p>You may be saying to yourself: &ldquo;This cat trick is fun, but
isn't there some way I can just give a true-or-false expression?
Like, either the file exists and is readable, or not?&rdquo; Yes, you
can. There is a command whose whole job is to succeed or fail
depending on whether the expression you give is true or not: test.
This is why your test programs called &ldquo;test&rdquo; never work, by the
way. Here is our program, rewritten to use test:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
if
    test -r weekly.report
then
    lpr weekly.report
    Mail boss &lt; weekly.report
    cp weekly.report /floppy/report.txt
    rm weekly.report
else
    echo I see no weekly.report file here.
fi
</pre><p>The test command's <b  >-r</b> operator means,
&ldquo;Does this file exist, and can I read it?&rdquo; test is quiet
regardless of whether it succeeds or fails, so there's no need for
anything to get sent to /dev/null.</p><p>Test also has an alternative syntax: you can use a
<b  >[</b> character instead of the word test, so long as
you have a <b  >]</b> at the end of the line. Be sure to
put a space between any other characters and the
<b  >[</b> and the <b  >]</b> characters! We
can make our if look like this now:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -r weekly.report ]
</pre><p>Hey, now <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> looks like a program! Even
though we're using brackets, this is still the test command. There
are lots of other things test can do for you; see its man page for
the complete list. For example, we seem to recall that what lets
you delete a file is not whether you can read it, but whether the
directory it sits in gives you write permission. So we can re-write
our script like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
if [ ! -r weekly.report ]
then
    echo I see no weekly.report file here.
    exit 1
fi
    if [ ! -w . ]
then
    echo I will not be able to delete
    echo weekly.report for you, so I give up.
    exit 2
fi
# Real work omitted...
</pre><p>Each test now has a <b  >!</b> character in it,
which means &ldquo;not&rdquo;. So the first test succeeds if the
weekly.report is not readable, and the second succeeds if the
current directory (&ldquo;.&rdquo;) is not writable. In each case, the script
prints an error message and exits. Notice that there's a different
number fed to exit each time. This is how Unix commands (including
<b  >if</b> itself!) tell whether other commands succeed:
if they exit with any exit code other than 0, they didn't. What
each non-zero number (up to 255) means, other than &ldquo;Something bad
happened,&rdquo; is up to you. But 0 always means success.</p><p>If this seems backwards to you, give yourself a cookie. It
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> backwards. But there's a good design reason
for it, and it's a universal Unix-command convention, so get used
to it.</p><p>Notice also that our real work no longer has an if wrapped
around it. Our script will only get that far if none of our error
conditions are detected. So we can just assume that all those error
conditions are not in fact present! Real shell scripts exploit this
property ruthlessly, often beginning with screenfuls of tests
before any real work is done.</p><p>Now that we've made our script more robust, let's work on
making it more general. Most Unix commands can take an argument
from their command lines that tells them what to do; why can't our
script? Because it has &ldquo;weekly.report&rdquo; littered all through it,
that's why. We need to replace weekly.report with something that
means &ldquo;the thing on the command line.&rdquo; Meet
<b  >$1</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
if [ ! -r $1 ]
then
    echo I see no $1 file here.
    exit 1
fi
if [ ! -w . ]
then
    echo I will not be able to delete $1 for you.
    echo So I give up.
    exit 2
fi
lpr $1
Mail boss &lt; $1
# and so forth...
exit 0
</pre><p><b  >$1</b> means the first argument on the command
line. Yes, <b  >$2</b> means the second,
<b  >$3</b> means the third, and so on. What's
<b  >$0</b>? The name of the command itself. So we can
change our error messages so that they look like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo $0: I see no $1 file here.
</pre><p>Ever noticed that Unix error messages introduce themselves?
That's how.</p><p>Unfortunately, now there's a new threat to our program: what
if the user forgets to put an argument on the command line? Then
the right thing for $1 to have in it would be nothing at all. We
might be back to our cascade of error messages, since a lot of
commands, such as rm, complain at you if you put nothing at all on
their command lines. In this program's case, it's even worse, since
the first time $1 is used is as an argument to test -r, and test
will give you a syntax error if you ask it to test -r nothing at
all. And what does lpr do if you put nothing at all on its command
line? Try it! But be prepared; you could end up with a mess.</p><p>Fortunately, test can help. Let's put this as the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very first</em></span> test in our program, right after
the <b  >#!/bin/bash</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if [ -z "$1" ]
then
    echo $0: usage: $0 filename
    exit 3
fi
</pre><p>Now if the user puts nothing on the command line, we print a
usage message and quit. The <b  >-z</b> operator means
&ldquo;is this an empty string?&rdquo;. Notice the double quotes around the
<b  >$1</b>: they are mandatory here. If you leave them
out, test will give an error message in just the situation we are
trying to detect. The quotes protect the nothing-at-all stored in
<b  >$1</b> from causing a syntax error.</p><p>This if clause appears at the very top of many, many shell
scripts. Among its other benefits, it relieves us from having to
wrap <b  >$1</b> in quote marks later in our program,
since if <b  >$1</b> were empty we would have exited at
the start. In fact, the only time quotes would still be necessary
would be if <b  >$1</b> could contain characters with a
special meaning to the shell, such as a space or a question mark.
Filenames don't, usually.</p><p>What if we want our script to be able to take a variable
number of arguments? Most Unix commands can, after all. One way is
clear: we could just cut and paste all the stuff in our shell
script, so we'd have a bunch of commands that dealt with
<b  >$1</b>, then a bunch of commands that dealt with
<b  >$2</b>, and so forth. Sound like a good idea? No?
Good for you; it's a terrible idea.</p><p>First of all, there would be some fixed upper limit on the
number of arguments we could handle, determined by when we got
tired of cutting, pasting, and editing our script. Second, any time
you have many copies of the same code, you have a quality problem
waiting to happen. You'll forget to make a change, or fix a bug,
all of the many places necessary. Third, we often hand wildcards,
like <b  >*</b>, to Unix commands on their command lines.
These wildcards are expanded into a list of filenames before the
command runs! So it's very easy to get a command line with more
arguments than some arbitrary, low limit.</p><p>Maybe we could use some kind of arithmetic trick to count
through our arguments, like <b  >$i</b> or something.
This won't work either. The expression <b  >$i</b> means
&ldquo;the contents of the variable called i&rdquo;, not &ldquo;the i'th thing on
the command line.&rdquo; Furthermore, not all shells let you refer to
command-line words after <b  >$9</b> at all, and those
that do make you use <b  >${10}</b>,
<b  >${11}</b>, and so forth.</p><p>So what do we do? This:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
while [ ! -z "$1" ]
do
    # do stuff to $1
    shift
done
</pre><p>Here's how we read that script: &ldquo;While there's something in
<b  >$1</b>, we mess with it. Immediately after we finish
messing with it, we do the <b  >shift</b> command, which
moves the contents of <b  >$2</b> into
<b  >$1</b>, the contents of <b  >$3</b> into
<b  >$2</b>, and so forth, regardless of how many of
these command-line arguments there are. Then we go back and do it
all again. We know we've finished when there's nothing at all in
$1.&rdquo;</p><p>This technique allows us to write a script that can handle
any number of arguments, while only dealing with
<b  >$1</b> at a time. So now our script looks like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
while [ ! -z "$1" ]
do
    # do stuff to $1
    if [ ! -r $1 ]
    then
        echo $0: I see no $1 file here.
        exit 1
    fi
        # omitted test...
    lpr $1
    Mail boss &lt; $1
    # and so forth...
    shift
done
exit 0
</pre><p>Notice that we nested <b  >if</b> inside
<b  >while</b>. We can do that all we like. Also notice
that this program quits the instant it finds something wrong. If
you would like it to continue on to the next argument instead of
bombing out, just replace an <b  >exit</b> with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
shift
continue
</pre><p>The <b  >continue</b> command just means &ldquo;Go back
up to the top of the loop right now, and try the control command
again.&rdquo; Thought question: why did we have to put a shift right
before the continue?</p><p>Here's a potential problem: we've made it easy for someone to
use this program on files that live in different directories. But
we're only testing the current directory for writability. Instead,
we should do this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
if [ ! -w `dirname $1` ]
then
    echo $0: I will not be able to delete $1 for you.
    # ...
</pre><p>The dirname command prints out what directory a file is in,
judging from its pathname. If you give dirname a filename that
doesn't start with a directory, it will print &ldquo;.&rdquo;--the current
directory. And those backquotes? Unlike all other kinds of
quotation marks, they don't mean &ldquo;this is really all one piece
ignore spaces.&rdquo; Instead, backquotes&mdash;also called &ldquo;grave
accents&rdquo;--mean &ldquo;Run the command inside the backquotes before you
run the whole command line. Capture all of the backquoted command's
output, and pretend that was what appeared on the larger command
line instead of the junk in backquotes.&rdquo; In other words, we are
substituting a command's output into another command line.</p><p>So here is the final version of our shell script:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
while [ ! -z "$1" ]
do
    if [ ! -r $1 ]
    then
        echo $0: I see no $1 file here.
        shift
        continue
    fi
    if [ ! -w `dirname $1` ]
    then
        echo $0: I will not be able to delete $1 for you.
        shift
        continue
    fi
    lpr $1
    Mail boss &lt; $1
    cp $1 /floppy/`basename $1`
    rm $1
    shift
done
exit 0
</pre><p>An exercise for the reader: what does <b  >`basename
$1`</b> do?</p><p>Now there are only two other techniques you need to know to
meet the vast majority of your scripting needs. First, suppose you
really do need to count. How do we do the equivalent of a C for
loop? Here's the traditional Bourne shell way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
i=0
upperlim=10
while [ $i -lt $upperlim ]
do
    # mess with $i
    i=`expr $i + 1`
done
</pre><p>Notice that we did not use the <b  >for</b>
keyword. <b  >for</b> is for something else entirely.
Instead, here we initialize a variable <b  >i</b> to 0,
then we enter and remain in the loop as long as the value in
<b  >i</b> is less than 10. (Fortran programmers will
recognize <b  >-lt</b> as the less-than operator; guess
why <b  >&gt;</b> is not used in this context.) The
rather mysterious line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
i=`expr $i + 1`
</pre><p>calls the expr command, which evaluates arithmetic
expression. We stuff expr's output back into <b  >i</b>
using backquotes.</p><p>Ugly, isn't it? And not especially fast either, since we are
running a command every time we want to add 1 to
<b  >i</b>. Can't the shell just do the arithmetic
itself? If the shell is the Bourne shell, no, it can't. But the
Korn shell can:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
((i=i+1))
</pre><p>Use that syntax if it works, and if you don't need
portability. The bash shell uses something similar:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
i=$(($i+1))
</pre><p>which is a bit more portable (it even works in the Korn
shell), since it is specified by POSIX, but still won't work for
some non-POSIX bourne shells.</p><p>So what does <b  >for</b> do? It allows you to wade
through a list of items, assigning a variable to each element of
the list in turn. Here's a trivial example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for a in Larry Moe Curly
do
    echo $a
done
</pre><p>which would print</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Larry
Moe
Curly
</pre><p>Less trivially, we can use this to handle the case where we
want to do something for each word in a variable:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mylist="apple banana cheese rutabaga"
for w in $mylist
do
    # mess with $w
done
</pre><p>or for each file matched by a shell wildcard pattern:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for f in /docs/reports/*.txt
do
    pr -h $f $f | lpr
done
</pre><p>or for each word in the output of a command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for a in `cat people.txt`
do
    banner $a
done
</pre><p>Here's how you can use for to simulate the C for you know and
love:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
do
    # mess with $i
done
</pre><p>Of course, it'd be very difficult to have a variable upper
limit with this syntax, which is why we usually use the while loop
shown above.</p><p>Congratulations! You've now seen what's at work in the vast
bulk of practical shell scripts. Go forth and save time!</p></div></div>
