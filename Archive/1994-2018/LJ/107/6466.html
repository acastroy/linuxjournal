    A trainable system that works with your current e-mail
    system to catch and filter junk mail.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19da580.0x1ad2500"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Spambayes Project is one of many
projects inspired by Paul Graham's &ldquo;A Plan for Spam&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html" target="_self">www.paulgraham.com/spam.html</a>).
This famous article talks about using a statistical technique
called Bayesian Analysis to identify whether an e-mail message is
spam. For the full story of how the mathematics behind Spambayes
works and how it has evolved, see Gary Robinson's accompanying
article on page 58.
</p><p>In a nutshell, the system is trained by a set of known spam
messages and set of known non-spam, or &ldquo;ham&rdquo;, messages. It breaks
the messages into tokens (words, loosely speaking) and gives each
token a score according to how frequently it appears in each type
of message. These scores are stored in a database. A new message is
tokenized and the tokens are compared with those in the score
database in order to classify the message. The tokens together give
an overall score&mdash;a probability that the message is spam.</p><p>The fact that you train Spambayes by using your own messages
is one of its strengths. It learns about the kinds of messages,
both ham and spam, that you receive. Other spam-filtering tools
that use blacklists, generic spam-identification rules or databases
of known spams don't have this advantage.</p><p>The Spambayes software classifies e-mail by adding an
X-Spambayes-Classification header to each message. This header has
a value of spam, ham or unsure. You then use your existing e-mail
software to filter based on the value of that header. We use a
scale of spamminess going from 0 (ham) to 1 (spam). By default,
&lt; 0.2 means ham and &gt; 0.9 means spam. Any e-mail between
those figures is marked as unsure. You can tune these thresholds
yourself; see below for information on how to configure the
software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19da580.0x1ad2768"></a>Why Spambayes Is Different</h2></div></div><p>Spambayes is different from other spam classifiers in three
ways: its test-based design philosophy, its tokenizer and its
classifier.</p><p>We can all think of obvious ways to identify spam: it has
SHOUTING subject lines; it tells you how to Make Money Fast!!!; it
purports to be from the vice president of Nigeria or his wife. It's
tempting to tune any spam-classification software according to
obvious rules. For instance, it should obviously be case-sensitive,
because FREE is a much better spam clue than free. But the
Spambayes team refused from the outset to take anything at face
value. One of the earliest components of the software was a solid
testing framework, which would compare new ideas against the
previous version. Any idea that didn't improve the results was
ditched. The results were often surprising; for instance, case
sensitivity made no significant difference. This
prove-it-or-lose-it approach has helped develop an incredibly
accurate system, with little wasted effort.</p><p>The tokenizer does the job of splitting messages into tokens.
It has evolved from simple split-on-whitespace into something that
knows about the structure of messages, for instance, tagging words
in the Subject line so that they are separately identified from
words in the body. It also knows about their content, for instance,
tokenizing embedded URLs differently from plain text. All the
special rules in the tokenizer have been rigorously tested and
proven to improve accuracy. This includes deliberately hiding
certain tokens&mdash;for example, we strip HTML decorations and ignore
most headers by default. Surprising decisions, but they're backed
up by testing.</p><p>The classifier is the statistical core of Spambayes, the
number cruncher. This has evolved a great deal since its beginnings
in Paul Graham's article, again through test-based development.
Gary's article, &ldquo;A Statistical Approach to the Spam Problem&rdquo;
(page 58), covers the classifier in detail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19da580.0x1ad2978"></a>Requirements and Installation</h2></div></div><p>The Spambayes software is available for download from
<a href="http://sf.net/projects/spambayes" target="_self">sf.net/projects/spambayes</a>.
It requires Python 2.2 or above and version 2.4.3 or above of the
Python e-mail package. If you're running Python 2.2.2 or above, you
should already have this. If not, you can download it from
<a href="http://mimelib.sf.net" target="_self">mimelib.sf.net</a> and
install it: unpack the archive, <b  >cd</b> to the
email-2.4.3 directory and type <b  >setup.py install</b>.
This will install it in your Python site-packages directory. You'll
also need to move aside the standard e-mail library; go to your
Python Lib directory, and rename the file email as
email_old.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19da580.0x1ad2be0"></a>Keeping up to Date</h2></div></div><p>Because the project is in constant development, things are
sure to change between my writing this article and the magazine
hitting the newsstand. I'll publish a summary of any major changes
on an Update page at
<a href="http://www.entrian.com/spambayes" target="_self">www.entrian.com/spambayes</a>.</p><p>Some of the things we're working on as I write this article
include more flexible command-line training; enabling integration
with more e-mail clients, such as Mutt; web-based configuration;
security features for the web interface; and easier installation.
I'll provide full details of these items on the Update page.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19da580.0x1ad2d98"></a>Components</h2></div></div><p>Three classifier programs are in the Spambayes software: a
procmail filter, a POP3 proxy and a plugin for Microsoft Outlook
2000. I cover the procmail filter and the POP3 proxy in this
article. A web interface (covered below) and various command-line
utilities, test harnesses and so on are also part of Spambayes; see
the documentation that comes with the software for full
details.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19da580.0x1ad2ea0"></a>Procmail-Based Setup</h2></div></div><p>If you use a procmail-based e-mail system, this is how the
Spambayes procmail system works:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>All your existing mail has a new
X-Spambayes-Trained header. The software uses this to keep track of
which messages it has already learned about.</p></li><li><p>The software looks at all your incoming mail.
Messages it thinks are spam are put in a &ldquo;spam&rdquo; mail folder.
Everything else is delivered normally.</p></li><li><p>Every morning, it goes through your mail folders
and trains itself on any new messages. It also picks up mail that's
been refiled&mdash;something it thought was ham but was actually spam
and vice versa. Be sure to keep spam in your spam folder for at
least a day or two before deleting it. We suggest keeping a few
hundred messages, in case you need to retrain the software.</p></li></ul></div><p>You'll need a working crond to set up the daily training job.
Optionally, you can have a mailbox of spam and a mailbox of ham to
do some initial training.</p><p>To set up Spambayes on your procmail system, begin by
installing the software. I'll assume you've put it in
$HOME/src/spambayes. Then, create a new database:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$HOME/src/spambayes/hammiefilter.py -n
</pre><p>If you exercise the option to train Spambayes on your
existing mail, type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$HOME/src/spambayes/mboxtrain.py \
-d $HOME/.hammiedb -g $HOME/Mail/inbox \
-s $HOME/Mail/spam
</pre>


You can add additional folder names if you like, using -g for good
mail folders and -s for spam folders. Next, you need to add the
following two recipes to the top of your .procmailrc file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
:0fw
| $HOME/src/spambayes/hammiefilter.py
:0
* ^X-Spambayes-Classification: spam
$HOME/Maildir/.spam/
</pre>


The previous recipe is for the Maildir message format. If you need
mbox (the default on many systems) or MH, the second recipe should
look something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
:0:
* ^X-Spambayes-Classification: spam
$HOME/Mail/spam
</pre>


If you're not sure what format you should use, ask your system
administrator. If you are the system administrator, check the
documentation of your mail program. Most modern mail programs can
handle both Maildir and mbox.
</p><p>Using <b  >crontab -e</b>, add the following cron
job to train Spambayes on new or refiled messages every morning at
2:21 <b  >AM</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
21 2 * * * $HOME/src/spambayes/mboxtrain.py -d
$HOME/.hammiedb -g $HOME/Mail/inbox
-s $HOME/Mail/spam
</pre><p>You also can add additional folder names here. It's important
to do this if you regularly file mail in different folders;
otherwise Spambayes never learns anything about those messages.
</p><p>Spambayes should now be filtering all your mail and training
itself on your mailboxes. But occasionally a message is misfiled.
Simply move that message to the correct folder, and Spambayes
learns from its mistake the next morning.</p><p>Many thanks to Neale Pickett for the information in this
section.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19da580.0x1ad36e0"></a>Setting Up the POP3 Proxy and the Web
Interface</h2></div></div><p>If you don't use Procmail or don't want to mess with it, or
if you want to set up the software on a non-UNIX machine, you can
use the POP3 proxy. This is a middleman that sits between your POP3
server and your e-mail program, and it adds an
X-Spambayes-Classification header to e-mails as you retrieve them.
You also can use the POP3 proxy with Fetchmail; simply reconfigure
Fetchmail to talk to the POP proxy rather than your real POP3
server.</p><p>The web interface lets you pretrain the system, classify
messages and train on messages received via the POP3 proxy, all
through your web browser. The software is configured through a file
called bayescustomize.ini. This is true of the Procmail filter as
well. There's no need to change any of the defaults to use it
out-of-the-box, but the POP3 proxy needs to be set up with the
details of your POP3 server. All the available options and their
defaults live in a file called Options.py, but you need to look at
that only if you're terminally curious or want to do advanced
tuning. The minimum you need to do is create a bayescustomize.ini
file like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[pop3proxy]
pop3proxy_servers: <span   class="emphasis"><em>pop3.example.com</em></span>
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>pop3.example.com</em></span> is wherever you
currently have your e-mail client configured to collect mail. The
proxy runs on port 110 by default. This is fine on non-UNIX
platforms, but on UNIX you'll want to use a different one by adding
this line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pop3proxy_ports: 1110
</pre>


to the [pop3proxy] section of bayescustomize.ini. If you collect
mail from more than one POP3 server, you can provide a list of
comma-separated addresses in pop3proxy_servers and a corresponding
list of comma-separated port numbers in pop3proxy_ports. Each port
proxies to the corresponding POP3 server.
</p><p>You can now run pop3proxy.py. This prints some status
messages, which should include something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Listener on port 1110 is
    proxying pop3.example.com:110
User interface url is http://localhost:8880
</pre><p>This means the proxy is ready for your e-mail client to
connect to it on port 1110, and the web interface is ready for you
to point your browser at the given URL. To access the web interface
from a different machine, replace localhost with the name of the
machine running pop3proxy.py.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19da580.0x1ad3b00"></a>Classifying Your E-mail Using the POP3
Proxy</h2></div></div><p>You now need to configure your e-mail client to collect mail
from the proxy rather than from your POP3 server. Where you
currently have pop3.example.com, port 110, set up as your POP3
server, you need to set it to localhost, port 1110. If you're
running the proxy on a different machine from your e-mail client,
use <span   class="emphasis"><em>machinename</em></span>, port 1110.</p><p>Classifying your mail is now as easy as clicking &ldquo;Get new
mail&rdquo;. The proxy adds an X-Spambayes-Classification header to each
message, and you can set up a filter in your mail program to file
away suspected spam in its own folder. Until you do some training,
however, all your messages are classified as unsure.</p><p>Once you're up and running, you should check your suspected
spam folder periodically to see whether any real messages slip
through, so-called false positives. As you train the system, this
will happen less and less often.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19da580.0x1ecbf60"></a>Training through the Web Interface</h2></div></div><p>Initial training isn't an absolute requirement, but you'll
get better results from the outset if you do it. You can use the
upload a message or mbox file form to train via the web interface,
either on individual messages or UNIX mbox files.</p><p>Once you're up and running, you can use the web interface to
train the system on the messages the POP3 proxy has seen. The
Review messages page lists your messages, classified according to
whether the software thought they were spam, ham or unsure. You can
correct any mistakes by checking the boxes and then clicking Train.
After a couple of days (depending on how much e-mail you get),
there'll be very few mistakes.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19da580.0x1ecc2d0"></a>Training Tips</h2></div></div><p>Spambayes does an excellent job of classifying your mail, but
it's only as good as the data on which you train it. Here are some
tips to help you get the best results:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Don't train on old mail. The characteristics of
your e-mail change over time&mdash;sometimes subtly, sometimes
dramatically&mdash;so it's best to use recent mail.</p></li><li><p>Take care when training. If you mistakenly train a
spam message as ham, or vice versa, it will throw off the
classifier.</p></li><li><p>Try to train on roughly as much spam as ham. This
isn't critical, but you'll get better results with a fair
balance.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19da580.0x1ecc640"></a>Possible Future Directions</h2></div></div><p>The Spambayes software is in constant development. Many
people are involved, and we have many ideas about what to do next.
Here's a taste of where the project might go:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Improving the tokenizer and classifier as new
research reveals more accurate ways to classify spam.</p></li><li><p>Intelligent autotraining: once the system is up and
running, it should be possible for it to keep itself up-to-date by
training itself, with users correcting only the odd mistake. We're
already doing something along these lines with the Procmail system,
but we're looking at ways of making it more automated and
compatible with all platforms.</p></li><li><p>SMTP proxy: to train the system from any e-mail
client on any platform, you could send a message to a special ham
or spam address. This could be a simple way to correct
classification mistakes, and it would combine well with intelligent
auto-training techniques.</p></li><li><p>Database reduction: the more you train the system,
the larger its database gets. We're looking at ways to keep the
database size down.</p></li><li><p>Integration with spam-reporting tools: the web
interface and the e-mail plugins could let you report spams to
systems like Vipul's Razor and Pyzor.</p></li><li><p>More e-mail client integration: we already have the
Outlook plugin, and we'd like to integrate with more e-mail
clients. The POP3 proxy and the web interface work well with any
e-mail client, but having a Delete as Spam button right there in
your e-mail client is much more convenient than switching to your
web browser.</p></li><li><p>Better documentation: we aim to publish
documentation on how to set up Spambayes on all the popular
platforms and e-mail clients.</p></li></ul></div><p>By the time this article is in print, some of these things
