    Whether you want to connect your home system to the Web
    while you're at work or need to view e-mail attachments on a
    remote system, the <i  >LJ</i> web site has an article about it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe56580.0xf4e3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>I am writing this article on my last day
of work before I leave; later tonight, I'll be on a red-eye flight
to Pennsylvania to spend Christmas and New Year's with my family.
Besides the chance to wake up to a snow-covered lawn, one of the
things I am most looking forward to is not having e-mail access for
two whole weeks. Oddly enough, my friends find this weird&mdash;both my
lack of access and my excitement over it. Even my friend who barely
knew what e-mail was a mere six months ago expressed shock about my
willingly going without it.
</p><p>For those of you who can sooner imagine parting with a limb
than parting with e-mail, the <i  >Linux Journal</i>
web site has some articles that should prove both interesting and
useful. First off is Nick Moffitt's advice for &ldquo;Busting Spam with
Bogofilter, Procmail and Mutt&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6439.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6439</a>).
Nick presents the macros he added to his system-wide configuration
file to make training a Bayesian spam-filtering system as easy as
deleting spam and saving or replying to interesting mail&mdash;things
you do anyway. His macros are also good for personal Mutt
configurations, so you don't need root access to start catching
spam now.</p><p>If you've ever had a need or desire to access your home
system remotely but can't SSH in because of a firewall, &ldquo;Using
E-mail as a System Console&rdquo; can help solve your dilemma. This
three-part series
(<a href="../000/6453.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6453</a>,
with links to Parts II and III) is the work of Michael Schwarz,
Jeremy Anderson, Peter Curtis and Steven Murphy from their book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Multitool Linux</em></span>. They explain how you can use
Fetchmail, Procmail and a few scripts to access information,
execute commands and even connect to the Internet strictly from
e-mail.</p><p>Writing an article rejection letter led to &ldquo;Mutt Over SSH,
but What about Attachments?&rdquo;
(<a href="../000/6511.html" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6511</a>)
by <i  >Linux Journal</i> Editor in Chief Don Marti.
Usually our rejection letters are not this extensive, but in
explaining why the article did not go far enough, Don ended up
offering some methods for viewing e-mail attachments remotely.
Reader-posted comments have continued the conversation, debating
the merits of IMAP vs. its slow speed. If you've got a better way
of dealing with viewing e-mail attachments remotely, please write
about it in the article comments section. Don really wants to know
a better way.</p><p>If you want to share the details of a unique e-mail
configuration you've designed that can, say, command your house to
clean itself or enable you to launch bottlerockets from work, drop
us a line at
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>.
Remember to check the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web site
often; new articles are posted daily.</p><p>Epilogue: So the holidays are over, and it's my first day
back at work. Over dinner last night, I told a friend that I'd be
happy if less than 500 e-mails were waiting for me. The final
count? 846.</p></div></div>
