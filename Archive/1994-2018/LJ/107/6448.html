    Mailing lists are great for discussion, and now you can take
    a vote with your mailing list too.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f4b580.0x2043500"></a></h2></div></div><p>A specialized database server for keeping
votes, combined with a conferencing system, can create a medium for
a true nonhierarchical democracy (see the Ideal Democracy Sidebar).
The work of administering the voting system would be shared by the
users and the software, not the system administrator. When the
correct architecture for the problem came to me, I could no longer
simply advocate Electronic Democracy; I built it.
</p><p><a href="6448s1.html" target="_self">Ideal Democracy Includes Both
Discussion and Voting</a></p><p>The specialized vote server, the Clerk, is written in C++ and
provides many features for voters. Anyone can initiate a poll, and
users can change their votes as long as the poll is open. Polls
also can be public, allowing all the participants to view each
other's votes, private, or if_voted, allowing us to know who voted
but not how they voted. Several poll types are supported: yes/no,
numeric and grouped. The software is easily enhanced to add new
features and poll types by extending the existing classes. The
Clerk maintains data on the fly, requiring no help from the
administrator. True to the promise of object-oriented architecture,
the addition of each new feature has made the code more
robust.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f4b580.0x2043710"></a>The Ballots</h2></div></div><p>The ballots are dynamic. When the user closes her poll and
then drops it from the conference, and when the software is
otherwise idle, the ballots are collapsed, rolling the storage
bytes for other items toward the top and making space for new
polls. The item objects recalculate their new places in the
ballots, and everything is set to continue without any intervention
from the administrator.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f4b580.0x2043818"></a>The Clerk's Communication with the Voter</h2></div></div><p>The Clerk's main() function is an infinite loop that watches
for incoming messages on the interprocess communication messaging
facility from eVote clients, i.e., user-interface processes with
live voting users. The Clerk has one permanent message queue for
incoming requests from users, and it is managed by the single
instance of the InQ class. Each eVote process has a temporary
message queue of its own for receiving messages from the Clerk.
These are instantiations of the OutQ class.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f4b580.0x2043920"></a>Shared Memory</h2></div></div><p>Although the statistics about polls and the personal
information requested by a voter are communicated via the OutQ
objects, another interprocess communication facility, shared
memory, is used for slow-moving data. The list of poll items and
their properties are stored in shared memory so that all the eVote
clients currently active in the same conference can see them.
Properties of the poll items may include public, private or
if_voted, where users can see if another voter has voted, but not
how he voted; yes/no or numeric; visible or hidden, where the
statistics are available only after the poll is closed; single or
grouped; and the title.</p><p>The conference's ItemList object is responsible for
maintaining the shared memory. When a new poll is created for a
conference, if the growing list of poll items requires a new patch
of shared memory, a message is sent to all active eVote clients.
This dynamic notification feature enables the voters to conduct
their meeting in real time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f4b580.0x2043a80"></a>Data Files</h2></div></div><p>The Clerk keeps three data files for each conference or
e-mail list and one overall data file that lists all the e-mail
addresses and a corresponding numerical ID. For the sample e-mail
list, a sample.dat with the current ballots, keyed by the voter's
numerical ID, is kept by the BallotBox object. The BallotBox also
keeps sample.bnf, which contains a hash into sample.dat and some
handy statistics. A sample.inf file storing the current map of
items onto the ballots is maintained by the ItemList object.</p><p>eVote, the user interface, keeps a petition's signatures and
comments in a flat file, one file per petition.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f4b580.0x2043be0"></a>User Interfaces</h2></div></div><p>At this time, the Clerk has two user interfaces and invites
more. The Clerk's first user interface is a simple text-based
Telnet interface, designed with conferencing systems and BBSes in
mind.</p><p>The explosion of the Internet dampened enthusiasm for
conferencing systems. E-mail arose as the dominant form of
communication, and e-mail lists became the community discussion
medium. So the e-mail user interface was built to allow e-mail
communities to make formal decisions, while still using the popular
Mailman mailing-list software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f4b580.0x2043d40"></a>The E-mail Interface</h2></div></div><p>eVote's e-mail list interface provides three levels of
participation:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Voter: users can vote and change their votes; they
also have the same power to query the data, as does the
administrator of the poll and the list's owner.</p></li><li><p>User/administrator: any user can initiate a poll.
Under ordinary circumstances, only the user who starts a poll can
close or drop it from the data.</p></li><li><p>List owner: some commands are password-protected.
These provide overriding powers so the owner can close/drop any
poll, change the voting privileges or move a participant's ballot
to a new e-mail address. The list's owner also retains the same
responsibilities and powers as owners of lists without
eVote.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f4b580.0x20440b0"></a>Five Executables</h2></div></div><p>The overall architecture of the e-mail facility is shown in
Figure 1. eVote is five programs that work together: eVote_Clerk,
the Clerk; eVote_insert, the e-mail list user interface;
eVote_mail, the mail administrator's utility interface;
eVote_petition, the interface for signers of petitions; and eVote,
the command center for controlling the Clerk.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6448f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. eVote's Mail Interface</p></div></div>
</p><p>eVote_Clerk runs continuously in the computer's background,
establishing new polls, dropping old items, accepting, tallying,
storing and reporting votes and statistics. eVote_Clerk has no
direct user interface. It is started, controlled and stopped by the
eVote executable.</p><p><a href="6448s2.html" target="_self">Many Possibilities: eVote's Poll
Types</a></p><p>The eVote_insert executable is the e-mail interface that
coordinates with Mailman, the popular open-source e-mail list
server. Mailman provides the discussion medium; eVote provides the
voting facility. This cooperation is configured in the alias file
of the mail transfer agent (MTA). Exception: if the MTA is Exim and
the listserver is Mailman, Exim's configuration file handles lists
and the cooperation with eVote.</p><p>eVote_mail allows the site administrator to synchronize the
Clerk's list of subscribers to Mailman's list. The site
administrator can use this program to block voting from a specific
address or to drop an address from all lists. Similarly, this
program can delete stale messages that have been awaiting
confirmation.</p><p>Two facilities are present in eVote's e-mail interface:
polling in e-mail lists and petition support. The petition facility
allows anyone to participate, while the e-mail list facility allows
only addresses on the e-mail list to participate. Petitions are
administered collaboratively by members of a petition list, which
is any list whose name starts with the word petition, say,
petitiona, petitionb and so on. Polls initiated in petition lists
have the option of being open to nonmembers.</p><p>The eVote executable is the command center for eVote and can
be called with various arguments. Depending on the argument, eVote
will start, stop or check the Clerk, check and synchronize data, or
flush or restart the log.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f4b580.0x2044630"></a>How eVote/Clerk Integrates with Mailman</h2></div></div><p>Mailman can be invoked by any MTA such as sendmail, Exim or
Postfix. Normally, mail directed to the e-mail list address is
piped to Mailman's wrapper program to control permissions on the
process and to limit the programs executed through the pipe. The
wrapper then calls Mailman's post script to broadcast the mail to
the list's addresses.</p><p>The alias entry for the regular Mailman list called sample
might look like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sample:         "|/home/mailman/bin/wrapper post
sample"
sample-admin:   "|/home/mailman/bin/wrapper mailowner
sample"
sample-request: "|/home/mailman/bin/wrapper mailcmd
sample"
sample-owner:   sample-admin
</pre><p>The mailcmd program needs a few new lines of code to tell it
to send e-mail notification to eVote whenever someone successfully
subscribes or unsubscribes from the list.</p><p>Mail to be broadcast to list members is piped to Mailman's
post program by the sample: alias.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6448f2.large.jpg"><img src="6448f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Mailman without eVote
</p></div></div><p>eVoting is turned on by inserting eVote_insert in the
pipe:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sample: "|/home/mailman/bin/wrapper
eVote_insert post sample"
</pre><p>Wrapper's C source code gets a few modifications so it will
allow eVote_insert to be run. Now eVote gets a first look at all
the mail coming into the list's broadcasting address. If the first
word in the incoming message is eVote, eVote_insert intercepts the
message for vote processing. Otherwise, it sends the message on to
post (Figure 3).

Figure 3. eVote Checks Mail
</p></div></div>

</p><p>Petition lists are set up exactly as other eVote lists. As
previously mentioned, eVote recognizes them as special because
their names start with &ldquo;petition&rdquo;. These are intended to be used
for collaborating on the administration of a petition. Members of a
petition list can discuss and poll themselves, and they also have
the power to set up a petition for the whole world to sign. These
petitions can include any of eVote's vote types, and they always
invite a comment from the signers.</p><p>The petition facility has an additional alias for receiving
signatures:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
eVote: "|/home/mailman/mail/wrapper eVote_petition"
</pre><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6448f4.large.jpg"><img src="6448f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>The one eVote_petition alias processes signatures for all
petition lists at the facility.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f4b580.0x203b8b8"></a>Two Enhancements for Elections</h2></div></div><p>As it is, the eVote/Clerk system is not designed for and is
not suitable for presidential elections. With two major
enhancements, however, it could be the most secure and accurate
solution. The required enhancements are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A networking layer so networked Clerks manage the
distributed data. The network would also facilitate a check on
other Clerks' data and calculations. For example, if a voter votes
with one Clerk and is sent a receipt from that Clerk, and later, a
second receipt is sent to the voter from a different, randomly
chosen Clerk, this process would ensure the integrity of all the
Clerks.</p></li><li><p>A secure encryption layer so only the software and
the voter can see that voter's ballot.</p></li></ol></div><p>With these enhancements, the Clerk could provide more
security than generalized database servers because Clerks can
redundantly and geographically distribute the votes to many small
computers running a GNU system. In addition, the individual
administrators have minimal responsibility and minimal power, and
each administrator is watched by the network of Clerks. Finally,
the Clerk involves voters in facilitating not only recounts and
redundant checks but revotes as well. With a system such as this
one, we can go confidently into our electro-democratic age.
