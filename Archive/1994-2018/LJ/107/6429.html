    No matter how many buttons an input device has or how many
    kinds of events it can generate, you can now work with it
    from user space.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xff4580.0x10ec608"></a></h2></div></div><p>In last month's article, we saw how the
Linux input subsystem worked inside the kernel, ending with a quick
mention of the event handlers. Each handler essentially provides a
different user-space API, converting input events into the
particular format that makes up that API.</p><p>One of the key aspects of the input subsystem integration
into Linux is the availability of the event interface. This
basically exposes the raw events to userspace through a collection
of character device nodes&mdash;one character device node per logical
input device. The event interface is a really powerful technique,
because it allows the manipulation of the events in userspace
without information loss. For example, legacy mouse interfaces
support only two relative axes and up to five buttons. These are
normally mapped to the two real axes and three real buttons, with
the fourth and fifth buttons logically being mapped to the scroll
wheel up and scroll wheel down events.</p><p>However, this mapping becomes a problem when trying to use a
mouse with a scroll wheel and more than three buttons, because any
additional buttons can be mapped only to an existing button. The
legacy APIs also impede use of advanced input devices, such as
space balls and other devices' with many axes. By contrast, the
event API provides full access to the devices capabilities, and it
even includes a per-device description of those capabilities and
other device characteristics.</p><p>This month's article focuses on the various ioctl
capabilities of the event interface, in addition to the normal read
and write calls.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xff4580.0x10ec818"></a>Finding the Version of the Event
Interface</h2></div></div><p>The event interface supports determining the version of the
event device code, using the EVIOCGVERSION ioctl function. The
argument is an int (32 bits) and is meant to be interpreted as a
major version (two high bytes), a minor version (third byte) and a
patch level (low byte). The same value is returned from each event
device on a machine.</p><p>An example of the EVIOCGVERSION is shown in Listing 1. The
first argument to the ioctl function is an open file descriptor for
the event device node (for example, /dev/input/event0). Notice that
you have to pass a pointer to the integer variable, not the
variable itself, as the third argument to the ioctl call.</p><p><a href="6429l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Sample EVIOCGVERSION
Function</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xff4580.0x10eca28"></a>Finding Information about the Device's
Identity</h2></div></div><p>The event interface supports retrieving information
associated with the underlying device using the EVIOCGID ioctl. The
argument is a pointer to an input_id structure; the input_id
structure is defined as shown in Listing 2. The __u16 data type is
a Linux-specific, unsigned 16-bit integer. You can safely cast it
to a standard uint16_t in your code.</p><p><a href="6429l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. iput_id Structure
Definitions</a></p><p>The bus type is the only field that contains accurate data.
You should probably consider it to be an opaque, enumerated type,
and compare it with the various BUS_x type definitions provided in
&lt;linux/input.h&gt;. The vendor, product and version fields are
bus type-specific information relating to the identity of the
device. Modern devices (typically using PCI or USB) do have
information that can be used, but legacy devices (such as serial
mice, PS/2 keyboards and game ports on ISA sound cards) do not.
These numbers therefore are not meaningful for some values of bus
type.</p><p>An example of the EVIOCGID ioctl is shown in Listing 3. This
example calls the ioctl and then prints out the results. The case
logic shows all current bus types. Here is an example of running
that code: <b  >vendor 045e product 001d version 0111 is on a
Universal Serial Bus</b>.</p><p><a href="6429l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Sample EVIOCGID
ioctl</a></p><p>In addition to the type of bus and the vendor, product and
version information, some devices can provide strings that make up
meaningful names. This can be obtained from the event interface
using the EVIOCGNAME ioctl. This ioctl provides a string and
returns the length of the string (or a negative error value). If
the string is too long to fit into the argument, it will be
truncated. An example is provided in Listing 4. If it seems strange
that the argument is not &amp;name, remember the name of an array
is the same as a pointer to the first element. Therefore, &amp;name
would be a pointer to a pointer to the first element, which is not
what we want. If you really want to use a dereference, use
&amp;(name[0]).</p><p><a href="6429l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Example Trunctated
String</a></p><p>Here is an example of running that event code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
The device on /dev/input/event0 says its name
    is Logitech USB-PS/2 Optical Mouse
</pre><p>Not all devices contain meaningful names, however, so kernel
input drivers try to provide something meaningful. For example, USB
devices without manufacturer or product strings concatenate the
vendor and product ID information.
</p><p>Although device identity and name information is often
useful, it may not be sufficient information to tell which device
you have. For example, if you have two joysticks that are the same,
you may need to identify them based on which port they use. This is
usually known as topology information, and you can get this from
the event interface using the EVIOCGPHYS ioctl. Like EVIOCGNAME,
this provides a string and returns the length of the string (or a
negative error number). An example is shown in Listing 5; running
that example will produce something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
The device on /dev/input/event0 says its path
    is usb-00:01.2-2.1/input0
</pre><p><a href="6429l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. Using EVIOCGPHYS for
Topology Information</a></p><p>To understand what this string is showing, you need to break
it down into parts. The usb part means this is a physical topology
from the USB system. The 00:01.2 is the PCI bus information for the
USB host controller (in this case, bus 0, slot 1, function 2). The
2.1 shows the path from the root hub to the device. In this case,
the upstream hub is plugged in to the second port on the root hub,
and that device is plugged in to the first port on the upstream
hub. input0 means this is the first event device on the device.
Most devices have only one, but multimedia keyboards may present
the normal keyboard on one interface and the multimedia function
keys on a second interface. This topology example is shown in
Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6429f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Keyboard Topology
</p></div></div><p>This setup doesn't help if you swap the cables on two
identical devices. The only thing that can help in this case is if
the device has some form of unique identifier, such as a serial
number. You can get this information using the EVIOCGUNIQ ioctl. An
example is shown in Listing 6. Most devices don't have such an
identifier, and you will get an empty string from this
ioctl.</p><p><a href="6429l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6. Finding a Unique
Identifier</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xff4580.0x10ed420"></a>Determining the Device Capabilities and
Features</h2></div></div><p>For some applications, it might be enough to know the device
identity, because this would allow you to handle any special cases
depending on what device is being used. However, it doesn't scale
well; consider a case where you want to enable scroll wheel
handling only if the device has a scroll wheel. You really don't
want to have to list the vendor and product information for every
mouse with a scroll wheel in your code.</p><p>To avoid this problem, the event interface allows you to
determine which features and capabilities are available for a
particular device. The types of features supported by the event
interface are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>EV_KEY: absolute binary results, such as keys and
buttons.</p></li><li><p>EV_REL: relative results, such as the axes on a
mouse.</p></li><li><p>EV_ABS: absolute integer results, such as the axes
on a joystick or for a tablet.</p></li><li><p>EV_MSC: miscellaneous uses that didn't fit anywhere
else.</p></li><li><p>EV_LED: LEDs and similar indications.</p></li><li><p>EV_SND: sound output, such as buzzers.</p></li><li><p>EV_REP: enables autorepeat of keys in the input
core.</p></li><li><p>EV_FF: sends force-feedback effects to a
device.</p></li><li><p>EV_FF_STATUS: device reporting of force-feedback
effects back to the host.</p></li><li><p>EV_PWR: power management events.</p></li></ul></div><p>These are only the <span   class="emphasis"><em>types</em></span> of features; a
wide range of individual features can be found within each type.
For example, the EV_REL feature type distinguishes between X, Y and
Z axes and horizontal and vertical wheels. Similarly, the EV_KEY
feature type includes literally hundreds of different keys and
buttons.</p><p>The capabilities or features of each device can be determined
through the event interface, using the EVIOCGBIT ioctl. This
function allows you to determine the types of features supported by
any particular device, for example, whether it has keys, buttons or
neither. It further allows you to determine the specific features
that are supported, for example, which keys or buttons are
present.</p><p>The EVIOCGBIT ioctl takes four arguments. If we consider it
as ioctl(fd, EVIOCGBIT(ev_type, max_bytes), bitfield), then the fd
argument is an open file descriptor; ev_type is the type of
features to return (with 0 as a special case, indicating the list
of all feature types supported should be returned, rather than the
list of particular features for that type); max_bytes shows the
upper limit on how many bytes should be returned; and bitfield is a
pointer to the memory area where the result should be copied. The
return value is the number of bytes actually copied on success or a
negative error code on failure.</p><p>Let's look at a couple of examples of the EVIOCGBIT ioctl
call. The first example, Listing 7, shows how to determine the
types of features present. It determines how much memory is
required for the bit array using evtype_bitmask, based on the
EV_MAX definition in &lt;linux/input.h&gt;. The ioctl is then
submitted, and the event layer fills in the bit array. We then test
each bit in the array and show where the bit was set, which
indicates the device does have at least one of this type of
feature. All devices support the EV_SYN feature type in 2.5; the
input core sets this bit.</p><p><a href="6429l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7. Determining Features with
EVIOCGBIT</a></p><p>When run, with a keyboard as the target, the example in
Listing 7 produces:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Supported event types:
  Event type 0x00  (Synchronization Events)
  Event type 0x01  (Keys or Buttons)
  Event type 0x11  (LEDs)
  Event type 0x14  (Repeat)
</pre><p>With a mouse as the target, the example produces:
<pre     class="programlisting">

  Event type 0x00  (Synchronization Events)
  Event type 0x01  (Keys or Buttons)
  Event type 0x02  (Relative Axes)

Device</h2></div></div><p>Having determined what capabilities a particular device has,
you know what types of events it will produce and what types of
events you can send.</p><p>Retrieving events from a device requires a standard character
device &ldquo;read&rdquo; function. Each time you read from the event device
(e.g., /dev/input/event0), you will get a whole number of events,
each consisting of a struct input_event.</p><p><a href="6429l8.html" target="_self">Listing 8. Checking for Busy
Spots</a></p><p>The example shown in Listing 8 does a busy loop on the open
file descriptor, trying to read any events. It filters out any
events that don't correspond to keys and then prints out the
various fields in the input_event structure. Running this while
typing on my keyboard produced:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Event: time 1033621164.003838, type 1, code 37, value 1
Event: time 1033621164.027829, type 1, code 38, value 0
Event: time 1033621164.139813, type 1, code 38, value 1
Event: time 1033621164.147807, type 1, code 37, value 0
Event: time 1033621164.259790, type 1, code 38, value 0
Event: time 1033621164.283772, type 1, code 36, value 1
Event: time 1033621164.419761, type 1, code 36, value 0
Event: time 1033621164.691710, type 1, code 14, value 1
Event: time 1033621164.795691, type 1, code 14, value 0
</pre><p>You get one event per key press and another per key release.
</p><p>This read interface has all the normal characteristics of a
character device, meaning you don't need to use a busy loop. You
can simply wait until your program needs some input from the device
and then perform the read call. In addition, if you are interested
in the input from a number of devices, you can use the poll and
select functions to wait on a number of open devices at the same
time.</p><p>Sending information to the device is a process similar to
receiving it, except you use the standard write function instead of
read. It is important to remember that the data used in the write
call has to be a struct input_event.</p><p>A simple example of writing data is shown in Listing 9. This
example turns the Caps Lock LED on, waits 200 milliseconds and then
turns the Caps Lock LED off. It then turns the Num Lock LED on,
waits 200 milliseconds, and then turns the Num Lock LED off. The
cycle then repeats (in an infinite busy loop), so you see alternate
flashing of the two keyboard LEDs.</p><p><a href="6429l9.html" target="_self">Listing 9. Sample Data Write
Function</a></p><p>By now it should be fairly clear that you receive events only
when something changes&mdash;a key is pressed or released, the mouse is
moved and so on. For some applications, you need to be able to
determine what the global state of the device is. For example, a
program that manages keyboards may need to determine which LEDs are
currently lit and which keys are currently depressed on the
keyboard, even though some of the keys may have been depressed
before the application started.</p><p>The EVIOCGKEY ioctl is used to determine the global key and
button state for a device. An example is shown in Listing 10. This
ioctl is similar to the EVIOCGBIT(...,EV_KEY,...) function in some
ways; instead of setting a bit in the bit array for each key or
button that the device can send, EVIOCGKEY sets a bit in the bit
array for each key or button that is depressed.</p><p><a href="6429l10.html" target="_self">Listing 10. Determining a Device's
Global Key and Button State</a></p><p>The EVIOCGLED and EVIOCGSND functions are analogous to
EVIOCGKEY, except that they return which LEDs are currently lit and
sounds that are currently turned on, respectively. An example of
how you would use EVIOCGLED is shown in Listing 11. Again, each bit
is interpreted in the same way as the bits in the bit array are
filled in by EVIOCGBIT.</p><p><a href="6429l11.html" target="_self">Listing 11. Using
EVIOCGLED</a></p><p>You can determine the repeat rate settings for a keyboard
using the EVIOCGREP ioctl. An example is shown in Listing 12, with
two elements to the array. The first element specifies the delay
before the keyboard starts repeating, and the second element
specifies the delay between subsequent repeats. So if you hold down
a key, you'll get one character straight away, a second character
rep[0] milliseconds later, a third character rep[1] milliseconds
after the second character and another character every rep[1]
milliseconds thereafter, until you release the key.</p><p><a href="6429l12.html" target="_self">Listing 12. Checking the Repeat
Rate Settings</a></p><p>You also can set the key repeat rate using EVIOCSREP. This
uses the same two-element array that you'd use to get the settings,
as shown in Listing 13; it sets the initial delay to 2.5 seconds
and the repeat rate to 1 per second.</p><p><a href="6429l13.html" target="_self">Listing 13. Setting the Repeat
Rates</a></p><p>Some input drivers support variable mappings between the keys
held down (which are interpreted by the keyboard scan and reported
as <span   class="emphasis"><em>scancodes</em></span>) and the events sent to the input
layer. You can determine what key is associated with each scancode
using the EVIOCGKEYCODE ioctl. An example is shown in Listing 14,
which loops over the first 100 scancodes. The value of the scancode
(input to the function) is the first element in the integer array,
and the resulting input event key number (keycode) is the second
element in the array. You can also modify the mapping, using the
EVIOCSKEYCODE ioctl. An example is shown in Listing 15; this ioctl
maps my M key to always produce a letter N. Be aware that keycode
ioctl functions may not work on every keyboard&mdash;that USB keyboard
is an example of a driver that does not support variable
mappings.</p><p><a href="6429l14.html" target="_self">Listing 14. Looping over
Scancodes</a></p><p><a href="6429l15.html" target="_self">Listing 15. Mapping
Keys</a></p><p>The EVIOCGABS function also provides state information.
Instead of filling in a bit array that represents the global state
of boolean values, however, it provides a struct input_absinfo (see
Listing 16) for one absolute axis. If you want the global state for
a device, you have to call the function for each axis present on
the device. An example is shown in Listing 17. The elements in the
array are signed 32-bit quantities, and you can safely treat them
as equivalent to int32_t. The first element shows the current value
of the axis, the second and third elements show the current limits
of the axis, the fourth element shows the size of the &ldquo;flat&rdquo;
section (if any) of the response and the last element shows the
size of the error that may be present.</p><p><a href="6429l16.html" target="_self">Listing 16. input_absinfo for an

force-feedback devices: EVIOCSFF, EVIOCRMFF and EVIOCGEFFECT. These
functions currently send a force-feedback effect, remove a
force-feedback effect and determine how many simultaneous effects
can be used, respectively. Because the force-feedback support is
still emerging and substantial work remains to be done, it is a
little premature to fully document the API. The web sites listed in
the Resources section of this article may have updated information
by the time you read this.</p><p><a href="6429s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
