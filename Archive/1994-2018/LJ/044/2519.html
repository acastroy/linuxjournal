Guide</em></span> by Jeff Tranter back in December of last year, the
same month it hit the shelves of my local computer book store. I
wrote a fairly supportive review of the text in my &ldquo;Graphics
Muse&rdquo; column in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>, right
after having put to bed my multimedia chapter for the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Unix Web Server Book</em></span>. At the time I thought I
understood multimedia fairly well, since the research for my book
had been fairly thorough.</p><p>When <i  >Linux Journal</i> contacted me about
doing a review of this text, I jumped at the chance. I figured I
could just spiff up my old review and pass it along. It took some
time to get around to doing this &ldquo;spiffing&rdquo;, and in the
intervening period, I realized that this wasn't fair. I needed to
go back and re-evaluate the review and the text. Linux users
deserve up-to-date information. Besides, I had learned quite a bit
more about multimedia.</p><p>As it turns out, most of my initial inspection was right on
the money. Jeff's book covers a wide range of material related to
the creation and use of multimedia files with respect to the Linux
operating system. The text is approximately 350 pages, including
source code listings for a number of sample multimedia
applications. As usual, O'Reilly provides copies of the source from
their ftp site. Jeff's coverage of multimedia is thorough, although
it lacks detail in a few areas and provides information on subjects
that may not be necessary for most multimedia-application
developers.</p><p>When I first discovered this book, I thought &ldquo;Rats, Jeff
beat me to it.&rdquo; Much of what Jeff covers is listed in my own Linux
Graphics mini-HOWTO (LGH); however, a number of items, such as
audio, are not covered by the LGH. There is more detail about video
formats and tools and detailed programming considerations for
various hardware (CD-ROMs, joysticks and sound devices). All of
these make the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Multimedia Guide</em></span> a good
addition to the O'Reilly family of Unix books. The text is
decidedly aimed at developers and administrators. The actual use,
from an end-user perspective, of the various applications is not
covered in any serious detail by this text.</p><p>The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Multimedia Guide</em></span> is divided
into five sections:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Introduction to Multimedia</p></li><li><p>User's Guide</p></li><li><p>A Survey of Multimedia Applications</p></li><li><p>Multimedia Programmer's Guide</p></li><li><p>Appendices</p></li></ol></div><p>The first section introduces the reader to the various
concepts involved with multimedia such as the CD-ROMs, image file
formats and sound files. The chapters are generally brief, and the
one on audio is quite informative. Jeff is the originator and
maintainer of the Linux Sound HOWTO, and his experience shows in
his coverage of audio issues. There is a discussion on audio file
formats as well as a comparison of a few popular sound cards
available for Linux.
</p><p>Section two opens with a discussion on hardware requirements
for doing multimedia on Linux systems. Most of this section centers
on either the CD-ROM driver or the Linux sound driver, known at
various times as Voxware, TASD and OSS Lite and now available
commercially from 4Front Technologies
(http://www.4front-tech.com/). There is also a short chapter on the
joystick driver.</p><p>The second longest section, &ldquo;A Survey of Multimedia
Applications&rdquo;, covers applications for the various forms of
multimedia. There are chapters on sound and music applications,
graphics and animation applications, hypermedia applications and
games. When I first reviewed this text, I hadn't really considered
games as real multimedia applications, mostly because I seldom play
games on my computer. I now realize that was a mistake&mdash;one need
only look at the big computer retail chains' shelves of MS and Mac
games to realize this fact. Games implemented as network
applications using Java, JavaScript and the new Tcl/Tk plug-in for
Netscape are not covered, but general X Windows, SVGA and
command-line style games are discussed briefly.</p><p>The third section is very similar to the LGH in that the
chapters provide the program names and URLs associated with them
(if any). The number of applications covered is less than in the
LGH, but there are better descriptions of the applications in the
book; plus Jeff covers games and audio applications that the LGH
does not.</p><p>Chapter fourteen opens the fourth section, the &ldquo;Multimedia
Programmer's Guide&rdquo;. This section is the longest in the book and
covers all the devices discussed earlier. Other chapters in this
section cover some of the available graphics and windowing toolkits
available to multimedia developers. One chapter contains three
sample applications.</p><p>I didn't say much about this section in my first review but I
need to do so now. First, the chapter on programming sound devices
is quite good and the sample programs easy to follow. If you're
going to program sound for your applications, you definitely should
read this chapter.</p><p>The chapters on programming the joystick and CD-ROM devices
are out of date (the joystick chapter) or irrelevant (CD-ROM) for
current multimedia applications. I say this because the future of
multimedia on Linux is through X Windows, not SVGA. Joysticks and
other pointing devices should be programmed through the X Input
Extension (which XFree86 3.3 now supports and the commercial X
Server vendors Metro-X and Xi Graphics are rumored to be adding
soon) and not via direct management of the device. To be fair,
Jeff's book did come out before this support was publicly released
by XFree86, and it is only recently that developers have started to
make wide use of this server extension.</p><p>A CD-ROM's association with multimedia applications is
nothing more than another file system, accessed using the usual
file system APIs. In general, multimedia-application developers do
not need to know how to write drivers for the CD drives. Device
driver information is not generally provided in texts on multimedia
for other platforms (except for unusual devices). Again, to be
fair, I'm not certain whether information on how to write drivers
for new CD drives is provided in other texts. This chapter's
appearance in the Linux Multimedia Guide is not a detriment to the
text, but it is extraneous to multimedia-application
developers.</p><p>Chapter 17's discussion on graphics and windowing toolkits
provides some good reference material but not much detail. It would
have been nice to see Jeff take a stance on which toolkits might be
most beneficial for developers to start with or at least examine
more closely. Also, Jeff missed any reference to OpenGL. Of all the
toolkits he mentions, only Java is likely to be of greater interest
than OpenGL to Linux multimedia developers. OpenGL and Java are
widely accepted standards (real or de facto) whereas most of the
other toolkits mentioned are, at best, simply multi-platform.
OpenGL is available from both commercial X server vendors (Xi
Graphics and Metro-X) using software acceleration only (with
hardware acceleration planned) and is also available via Brian
Paul's terrific Mesa/GL package.</p><p>In general, I find the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Multimedia
Guide</em></span> a good reference text with a moderate degree of
developer tutorials. Unlike many of the books available for Linux,
this text provides a detailed explanation of the various
programming interfaces; it is a useful tool beyond the simple
&ldquo;what is this and where do I get it&rdquo; that many of the HOWTOS
provide. The main drawback that I see is that, like most other
Linux texts, this text does not provide a user's perspective on any
of the tools listed. If Linux is ever to go beyond a
developers-only platform, there will need to be detailed user's
guides for well-known applications. Still, Jeff does a good job
covering the extent of a large topic. Although not likely to be of
much interest to experienced developers, I have no problem
recommending this book for the beginner or the intermediate user or
developer.</p></div></div>
