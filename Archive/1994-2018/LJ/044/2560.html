Everywhere, http://www.ssc.com/glue/) e-mail list about a
certification program for Linux. Most of the discussion is
positive. Most writers feel that a comprehensive certification will
make great strides in enabling Linux to be used in the business
sector with more confidence. I would like to know how a larger
audience feels about it. For any certification program to be
representative, it must be a cooperative effort of all the major
Linux companies. A relatively subjective organization would need to
head the testing such as the LDP or SSC.</p><p>&mdash;Bryan Coleman, Triad Linux Users

was a little negative. [&ldquo;Linux and Web Browsers&rdquo;, Issue 37] Here
is some more positive news: Sun's HotJava 1.0 browser is available
from http://java.sun.com/products/hotjava/. When you look at the
distribution formats it has versions for Windows and Solaris.
However, the browser is written in Java, just called from a
different shell script for the two platforms. Download the Solaris
version and run it under JDK 1.1.1 to get a working browser for
Linux.</p><p>Sun MicroSystems, Inc. has bundled the HotJava web browser
with the Java Runtime Library for SunOS on SPARC hardware. The
download file is now 8.5MB.</p><p>Another choice is the Plume browser (formerly Surfit!) by
Steve Ball at the Australian National University
(http://tcltk.anu.edu.au/). This runs under Tcl/Tk 8.0. It is still
under development, but Steve is actively working on it. What's
more, you get the source code so you can do things with it too. The
current version of Plume is v0.62alpha.</p><p>&mdash;Jan Newmarch jan@ise.canberra.edu.au</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cee580.0x1de6450"></a>Linux and Ham Radio</h2></div></div><p>As an avid amateur radio operator and a Linux tinkerer for
nearly a year, I'd like to say a hearty &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; for the
positive coverage you give my favorite hobby in <i  >Linux Journal</i> [&ldquo;Packet Radio Under Linux&rdquo;, Jeff Tranter,
September 1997] and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> [Issues 10
and 11]. Of course, it's great having access to the only OS that
supports the packet radio protocol. Most other big-time magazines
wouldn't bother to print such articles, but it proves the editorial
commitment you have to covering all relevant aspects of Linux:
business, technical, hobby/recreation and more.</p><p>I'm always glad to see this type of article as it introduces
ham radio to a larger audience. We're always looking for more hams
willing to push the digital RF (Radio Frequency) envelope. I invite
all interested parties to get their license and join in building a
state-of-the-art, wireless, non-commercial TCP/IP network.</p><p>&mdash;Nate Bargmann KA0RNY nfbargma@notes.up.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cee580.0x1de66b8"></a>Big Brother</h2></div></div><p>If I'm not mistaken, anyone on the Internet can execute any
command on a machine with the CGI scripts you published on page 58
of <i  >LJ</i>'s August issue [&ldquo;Big Brother Network
Monitoring System&rdquo;, Paul M. Sittler].The script executes
<b  >$TRACEROUTE&lt;\!s&gt;$*</b>, so a cracker can feed
it with a machine name such as www.tamu.edu; then type
<b  >cat/etc/passwd</b> to see the last command being
executed.</p><p>In my opinion, CGI scripts should all be written in Perl with
the <b  >-T</b> option set (<b  >-T</b> tests
that the file type is text, not binary) and should include the line
<b  >use&lt;\!s&gt;strict</b>. Strict compliance for
symbolic references, global variables and key words&mdash;violations
cause immediate program abend. The Bourne shell is especially
dangerous. At least, enclose the arguments between double
quotes.</p><p>&mdash;bortzmeyer@pasteur.fr</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cee580.0x1de6a80"></a>Security Blanket</h2></div></div><p>I don't know that I have ever written to a magazine editor
before, but Lee Brotzman's contribution to the August 1997
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, &ldquo;Wrap a Security Blanket
Around Your Computer,&rdquo; was very timely and very well
written.</p><p>One of my client's Linux systems came under the control of
hackers (who fortunately were somewhat benign in their apparent
intentions for this particular system) about the time I received
the aforementioned copy of <i  >LJ</i>. During an
intense weekend of observation and examination of various system
logs, I was able to determine how the system had been compromised.
After considering various strategies (and reading the issue cover
to cover), I used Mr. Brotzman's article as a cookbook to install a
series of TCP wrappers while continuing to watch the hacker's
activities.</p><p>Not really knowing the expertise of the hackers, I surmised
they were also &ldquo;cook-booking&rdquo; and decided to slowly cut off their
air supply, in order to see what alternative methods of access, or
back doors, they may have established. Selectively applying
TCP_wrappers enabled me to do just that, and I received quite an
education in the process. Today, thanks to <i  >LJ</i>
and Lee Brotzman, my client's system is secure, and I have greatly
increased my understanding of security from an administrative
perspective.</p><p>Once again, thanks for publishing useful, accurate
information. If you have an award for writer of the year, I would
like to nominate Lee Brotzman for his clear, concise presentation
of an important topic. If you don't, start one.</p><p>&mdash;Mel Lester meljr@connet80.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cee580.0x1de6df0"></a>Various Comments</h2></div></div><p>I would like to commend you on such a fine publication. It is
good to see a magazine published on a regular basis about Linux,
that has such excellent content. I would just like to make a few
comments.</p><p>My first comment is regarding a couple of letters to the
Editor from the September issue (Issue 41). The two letters are
&ldquo;More Novice Articles&rdquo; and &ldquo;More Technical Articles&rdquo;. I feel
that <i  >LJ</i> has a nice balance of both novice and
advanced articles, which makes it useful for the beginner, the guru
and everyone in between.</p><p>My second comment is about the article &ldquo;Robocar: Unmanned
Ground Robotics&rdquo; by Kerry Kruempelstaedter (also Issue 41). I
found this article very interesting, although I believe that many
of the pictures were missing from the article. The first figure is
Figure 5, and 1 through 4 are...nowhere in site.</p><p>And finally, I have a question regarding your article titled
&ldquo;Quota: Managing Your Disk Space&rdquo; (and again, issue 41). Towards
the end of the article January says that to give everybody on your
system the same quota use <b  >edquota -p &lt;prototype&gt;
*</b>. If this gives everybody on your system the same quota.
Wouldn't this cause some problems? It is fine that all users get
the same quota, but what about root, bin, daemon and other such
users?</p><p>Overall though, it was yet another excellent article.</p><p>&mdash;Philip Cox phil@yucc.yorku.ca</p><p>Yes, pictures were left out of the Robocar article. There was
not room for all of them, and the ones in the magazine did not get
renumbered.</p><p>It's true that you would not want to set root, etc. to the
same quota as users. In the article, Mr. Rooijackers mentions
setting soft and hard to 0 for those accounts that should not have
a quota. In the quota HOWTO, it recommends turning quota on and off
for various partitions. Thus, if all your users are on one
partition, while root is on another, you can use the above command
to set the quota for all users, while not setting it for
root.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cee580.0x1de7210"></a>London Times?</h2></div></div><p>I don't know why you invented a non-existent paper to blame
the Hewson anti-Linux article for in <i  >LJ</i> #40
[From the Editor]. You get it right in the footnote (<span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Sunday Times</em></span>), but there is no such paper as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The London Times</em></span> as in your heading.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Times</em></span>, the paper some people think
published the article, is a different newspaper from <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Sunday Times</em></span>.</p><p>Congratulations on the generally high standard of
<i  >LJ</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Keith Briggs, England kmb28@cam.ac.uk</p><p>Sorry about that&mdash;the reference to it I had said the London
Times. The editor who checked the article later and added the
footnote should also have changed the reference in the body of the
article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cee580.0x1de7630"></a>Microstation95 for Linux</h2></div></div><p>The article on Microstation for Linux, in the July issue was
nicely done and well written. The only problem is in the section
&ldquo;Installed Base&rdquo; where it states &ldquo;The review kit states that
there are over 200,000 users of Microstation...&rdquo; I am sure they
don't include academic versions in that number. If this is the
case, then none of the 200,000 are running Linux. In addition, the
academic version is all that is available for Linux and to get it
you must prove you are a student or faculty member of a
four-year-degree university.</p><p>The sad truth of the matter is that Bentley, and for that
matter most other software companies, don't get enough requests for
Linux ports of their product, to justify the production costs. To
illustrate this point, here is a portion of an e-mail I received
from Phil Chouinard, a Bentley Representative, on August 4,
1997.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>... to date, a complete commercial port hasn't
happened. About the only thing that is holding us back right now is
a commitment from the business community. Note that we do not get
involved or wrapped up in OS wars&mdash;there is no winner in such (in
fact, we've heard the same arguments from MacOS loyalists, OS/2
followers, etc.) Since we have commercial products running on these
OSes where others don't, and we have also committed to the
Internet&mdash;recently licensing Java from Sun, convincing us to do a
full -fledged port really won't convince the business community to
go to Linux, but the opposite may be true.</p></blockquote></div><p>The above, I fear, is typical of the software community as a
whole. Linux is now at an awkward moment. If business will use
Linux, software companies will write programs for it. If software
companies will write programs for Linux, business will use Linux.
Neither wants to be first. How do we get out of this catch 22?

MicroStation 95, can be obtained from their web site at

71), I tried to compile it using the author's suggested command
line. Unfortunately for me it didn't work. I received a very vexing
error from /usr/lib/libforms.so complaining of undefined functions.
After fighting it a bit more, I decided to look at forms.ps and
found a difference between the command line suggested in the manual
and the author's. To make a long story short, this command line
worked on my system:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -o xhello xhello.c -lforms
        -lX11 -lm
</pre><p>It has all the same elements as the author's, only in a
different order. I am running a Slackware '96 system with kernel
version 2.0.30, Xfree86 3.3 and xforms 0.86. I guess I'll go with
what works.

done. It is a credit to the Linux community to have such a
well-written and timely publication devoted to it.</p><p>I was wondering if any development has been done on
integrating NDS (Novell Directory Services) into Linux? Novell has
recently announced the release of the NDS source code to
developers. Sun, HP and SCO have taken the hint and announced that
each will provide NDS support in upcoming releases of their OSs. I
have yet to find a place where Linux does not have the potential to
replace a commercial operating system, and I think that support of
a commonly used directory service would give a network manager even
one more reason to use Linux instead of SCO ODT, Solaris, HP-UX or
Netware.</p><p>&mdash;Tim McQueen mcquetm@mail.auburn.edu</p><p>Caldera is in the process of porting both NDS and NetWare
File and Print services to Linux. Both these technologies currently
require Streams, so Caldera is building the necessary
infrastructure into Linux to port these technologies. For more
information, please e-mail Caldera at info@caldera.com.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cee580.0x21dffb8"></a>New Chip Technologies</h2></div></div><p>I have been unable to follow current chip discussions on the
Net on the basis of these two new technologies: AMD's K6-233MHz
with MMX processors and Intel Pentium II, 233&amp;266MHz with MMX
processors</p><p>Are these technologies compatible with Linux? Is MMX
programming likely to be taken advantage of in Linux?</p><p>&mdash;Michael T. McGurty mmgurty@ovis.net</p><p>In answer to your first question, yes. Intel and AMD design
backward compatability into all new processor chips to assure
software compatability.</p><p>As to the second, Linux programming is likely to use advanced
MMX technology sometime in the future, but I have no answer as to
when&mdash;hopefully, this year. Of course, compatablity with the
installed user base is a concern. It would have to be a kernel
option. Multimedia extensions (MMX) optimize graphical video
display (X Windows) and sound subsystems performance.</p></div></div>
