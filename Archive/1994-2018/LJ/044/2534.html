many books released in the last year on the Common Gateway
Interface. CGI enables HTTP servers to return not just the contents
of an HTML file, but also the HTML-formatted text output from a
program. (Like many other books on the subject, this book appears
to have been rushed out.) There is a lack of attention to detail
and the example programs are not well structured and are poorly
presented.</p><p>Overall, I thought that the book was fairly well-organized,
although a number of sections were of questionable value. Books
cannot possibly explain all things to all people, and while
descriptions of client-server programming, of thin vs. fat clients
and of HTTP were all worthwhile, I felt that an explanation of how
different types of firewalls work was probably unnecessary.</p><p>I disliked the authors' programming style, which used very
few subroutines. If the authors were writing short programs, the
lack of subroutines would seem reasonable, but there were several
five-page program listings that lacked even a single subroutine.
(In addition, there were too many unbroken blocks of code in the
book.) True, the programs contain extensive comments&mdash;some of them
holdovers from when the code was discussed and improved on the
Internet, and others useful explanations of what the code is
doing&mdash;but I would have preferred to see them designed as well as
they were documented. Given that the front cover claims that the
book demonstrates good software design, it would have been nice to
see more modular code, perhaps broken up into reusable
libraries.</p><p>The authors purposely ignored the existing CGI libraries for
Perl, preferring to process CGI-related data on their own.
Moreover, the authors explicitly decided against using Perl 5 (in
favor of Perl 4), because of its object-oriented features; because
it &ldquo;would have required the explanation of the use of modules and
OOP in Perl&rdquo; and because &ldquo;the folks supporting some of the Perl
code shown here are not Perl programmers.&rdquo; Even non-Perl
programmers can and should learn about Perl's error-checking and
security mechanisms, which trap problems and make CGI programs
safer and easier to debug.</p><p>Indeed, very little space was dedicated to the tricky problem
of debugging CGI programs or of how to construct error messages
that make it easy to find problems in CGI code.</p><p>One of the chief benefits of the CGI standard is its
portability across platforms. However, as experienced CGI
programmers know, portability is guaranteed for the standard
itself, not for the languages or operating systems in which CGI
programs are written. I appreciated the author's note on the first
page of the preface, in which they acknowledge that &ldquo;this text is
a bit Unix-centric&rdquo;&mdash;but that understates the non-portable nature
of most of the code in the book. True, every program can be
modified so that it will run on other platforms, and they require
far fewer modifications than would be necessary if the programs
were written in C. However, to claim that the programs are portable
is a bit far-fetched, given their reliance on external Unix
utilities.</p><p>A number of editing and production issues also bothered me: a
large number of typographical errors and misspellings, a poor
choice of font in program listings, explanatory notes printed on a
dark background that makes some words almost illegible and an index
that is far too small. There was also no mention of DBM files or
relational databases, two data-storage technologies that every CGI
programmer will probably use at some time.</p><p>There were several nice parts to the book. The program for a
monthly-activities calendar was quite good, especially since it
allowed for two different views of the same data. There is an
extensive treatment of server-side includes, which contained a
listing of variables specific to SSIs. Also, a mention of how to
write CGI programs that retrieve data left by system utilities in
flat files is useful information. The authors explicitly named the
requirements for each project before embarking on it&mdash;something
that I wish more software engineers would do in today's
bug-infested world.</p><p>Overall, $50US seems a bit steep for this book, given that
the programs are often similar to those you can find on-line, the
explanations contain bugs and inaccuracies and the code is poorly
organized. With some serious editing, this book could have been
quite interesting&mdash;but in its current incarnation, the book is too
weak to stand on its own.</p></div></div>
