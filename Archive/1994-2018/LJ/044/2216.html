are essential. BRU 2000 for X11
(<span   class="bold"><b>xbru</b></span>) is a user-friendly
graphical interface for EST's BRU backup software. It is targeted
for users who want to easily back up their computer without having
to learn the command-line interface for their backup software. To
use the more complex options of BRU 2000, you still need to learn
BRU's command-line interface.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>xbru</b></span> came with BRU 2000;
however, I downloaded the newest version (as of July 1997) of xbru
from EST's web site. <span   class="bold"><b>xbru</b></span> is
freely available, but it does require BRU 15.0 which is sold by EST
Inc. <span   class="bold"><b>xbru</b></span> also requires Tcl 7.6
and tk 4.2, which are freely available (see Resources).</p><p>I had one problem during the installation procedure for
xbru&mdash;it wanted to install its files into the /usr/local/lib/bru
directory, but, unfortunately, on my computer, /usr/local is
mounted read-only from the NFS server. I sent e-mail to
support@estinc.com asking how to install into a directory other
than /usr/local/lib/bru. I later got a reply to my question, but
before the reply came, I had obtained permission to install xbru on
the NFS server.</p><p>Once I had root access on the server, the rest of the
installation was straightforward. I ran
<span   class="bold"><b>bru</b></span>, which was already installed,
on the X11 package from the command line using the following
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bru -xvf bru4X11.bru
</pre><p>Executing this command produced an install script to do the
installation, which I then ran.</p><p><a href="2216f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1. Main
Page of BRU</b></span></a></p><p>When you start up xbru, it asks you which device you wish to
use for backup. You can chose from the devices in your /etc/brutab
file, or you can select a file. I used a file for testing at first,
and later I tried it on a 4GB SCSI 4mm DAT tape drive. The main
screen gives a few default options that make standard backups very
easy: Full, Level 1 and Level 2. If you are root, Full does a full
backup of the entire system; otherwise, it does a full backup of
your home directory. The Level 1 and Level 2 options are more
complicated. Level 1 backs up files modified since the last Full
backup. Level 2 backs up files modified since the last Level-1
backup.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b3580.0x25abea0"></a>Help</h2></div></div><p>BRU comes with a hefty manual for its command-line software
which I didn't have time to look through thoroughly. There is a
25-page booklet for the X11 interface that is very basic and
generally easy to understand&mdash;a little more detail might have been
helpful. There is context help for the backup and restore
operations which was helpful, but would have been even more helpful
if it had included other operations and dialog boxes.</p><p>The main on-line help was more troublesome&mdash;it launched a web
browser (Netscape, by default) to look at EST's web page. Starting
the browser suspended xbru until you exited the browser. As a
result, you can't easily refer to the help page while using xbru.
You can start a web browser independent of xbru and go to EST's
page, but, of course, this solution is less convenient. Also, xbru
points the browser at EST's main web page, not a page dedicated to
help for BRU and not to a local help file. This last can be
particularly bothersome, if you are not always connected to the
Internet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b3580.0x25ac000"></a>Problems</h2></div></div><p>After resolving my problems with the /usr/local directory, I
had no other major problems. Mainly, xbru just showed a general
lack of polish&mdash;as if it had been rushed out the door in order to
be able to advertise the inclusion of a user-friendly GUI. Some of
the little problems I had were:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>I received several Tcl error messages when xbru got
confused.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>xbru</b></span> locked up
every time I did a search through the backup listings.</p></li><li><p>Whenever I created a new backup, the buttons to
restore, verify or list the backup were disabled until I restarted
the program.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b3580.0x25ac3c8"></a>User Interface</h2></div></div><p>The whole point of xbru is to supply an easy-to-use front end
for BRU, so the interface is a big part of the package. Overall I
liked the interface. The front screen was simple, with only a few
options. Unfortunately, the Full, Level 1 and Level 2 buttons are
slightly confusing to a new user who hasn't looked at the
documentation closely. The little message bar at the bottom of the
screen does explain the buttons more thoroughly; however, since
there is a lot of unused space on the front screen, labeling the
buttons &ldquo;Full Backup&rdquo;, &ldquo;Level 1 Backup&rdquo; and &ldquo;Level 2 Backup&rdquo;
would be less confusing. Also, substituting an explanatory
paragraph next to the buttons for the large EST logo would
certainly be more helpful to the new user.</p><p><a href="2216f2.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 2.
Backup Screenshot</b></span></a></p><p>The backup page was similar to other backup programs I have
used, and I found it generally intuitive.</p><p><a href="2216f3.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 3.
Restore Screenshot</b></span></a></p><p>The restore page was not quite so easy to understand. The
confusing thing about the restore page was that on the left it gave
a listing of files labeled as the current directory, but it listed
only those files I had backed up, not all of the files on my hard
drive. I could move these files to a listing labeled as the backup
device to restore the files. While it worked as I expected from
using other backup products, the labels just seemed
confusing.</p><p>The verify and list operations were relatively simple and
understandable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b3580.0x25ac7e8"></a>Extra Features</h2></div></div><p>Along with the ability to do backups on the spot, you can
also save backup definitions and schedule them to be run at any
time. This ability is essential for any long-term backup strategy.
The xbru interface for this option was very easy to understand.
Another nice option that came with xbru was a utility to configure
the /etc/brutab file. This is beta software so it isn't mentioned
in the documentation. Hopefully, by the time this review is
published, a final version of this software will be
available.</p><p>I would recommend xbru for someone who wants to do backups of
a home computer but nothing much more complicated. (Don't get xbru
confused with BRU 2000's command-line interface which is quite
powerful and robust&mdash;see below.) It is easy to use and doesn't
require you to go digging through lots of documentation before you
use it. I managed to use nearly all of its features without having
to look in the manual.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24b3580.0x25ac948"></a>About Command-Line BRU</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>xbru</b></span> is an interface to the
original, command-line BRU backup software. BRU is a very flexible
and powerful backup program. It is much more reliable than tar and
friends, supporting CRC error detection and automatic verification
after backup to ensure that you don't have a bad tape. You can
schedule backups to run automatically and even change the tapes in
an auto-loading tape drive for multi-tape backups. BRU backs up all
types of files: device files, sparse files, pipes, soft and hard
links, etc. The list of features is too long for me to cover here.

Utility&rdquo;, <i  >Linux Journal</i>, March 1995, Issue
