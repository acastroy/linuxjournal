    This article describes a Perl HTML preprocessor that takes
    the work out of building web pages.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2510580.0x2608348"></a></h2></div></div><p>When I started building my company's web
site about a year ago, I looked for a good, visual web editor, and
finding one quickly produced some nice web pages. A week later, I
had thrown the web editor away and was working on a tool to solve
some of the major difficulties I had found. In this article I'll
look at the result&mdash;a free HTML preprocessor written in Perl&mdash;that
makes mass production of web pages a feasible and economical task.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>htmlpp</b></span> was one of the first
Perl programs I wrote, and I've not regretted the choice of
language. Perl allows me to add functions to the program as fast as
I can think of them. The consequence is that htmlpp is a very rich
tool, making the task of maintaining a web site with thousands of
pages easy.</p><p>There are at least a dozen free HTML preprocessors available
today; I know of three with the name
<span   class="bold"><b>htmlpp</b></span>. Something is driving
people to write these programs, but what? Some 95% of the web pages
I produce are on-line documentation, and I dislike building these
by hand. Each page needs a standard header, footer and appearance.
When I change my mind, it takes a lot of mouse clicks to go through
each web page again, and a lot of care to make sure that every page
conforms to my preferred style.</p><p>Thus, I started htmlpp with the idea: &ldquo;take a large text
file and break it into smaller web pages, adding pretty headers and
footers, building the table of contents, cross-references and
hyperlinks.&rdquo; It would also be nice to define symbols like
<b  >$(version)</b> and place them into the text. How
about conditional blocks so that I can generate frame and non-frame
web pages from the same document, a way to share definitions
between projects, a <span   class="bold"><b>for</b></span> loop to
build structured text, access to environment variables and Perl
macros, some more hot coffee and a raisin bagel?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>htmlpp</b></span> uses the term
&ldquo;document&rdquo; to refer to the text files it inputs. This is a
&ldquo;hello world&rdquo; document:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 .echo Hello, World.
</pre><p>Here's something more involved:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 .define new-year 0101
.if "&amp;date("mm-dd")" eq "$(new-year)"
.  echo Happy New Year!
.else
.  echo Hello, World.
.endif
</pre>


If you've used C or C++, htmlpp looks very much like the C
preprocessor. You get commands like
<span   class="bold"><b>.define</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>.include</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>.if</b></span> that work in a similiar
fashion to the C preprocessor equivalents. For instance, the .if
command works at &ldquo;compile time&rdquo;, i.e., when you build the HTML
pages, not when they are displayed by the browser. Some other
htmlpp commands were borrowed from the Unix shells.
</p><p>Note how I define a symbol, <b  >new-year</b>, and
then use it in the document as <b  >$(new-year)</b>.
<span   class="bold"><b>htmlpp</b></span> provides many variations on
this theme; for example, the $(*...) form creates a
hyperlink:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
.define lj http://www.ssc.com/lj/
$(*lj="Linux Journal"&lt;\n&gt;) is the magazine of the Linux community.
</pre><p>To define a counter which runs from 0 upwards:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 .define counter++ 0
</pre>


A realistic htmlpp script uses the .page command to create HTML
pages. Listing 11 shows the template file supplied by htmlpp for
your new projects.
</p><p><a href="2448l1.html" target="_self">New Project Template</a></p><p>Each HTML page gets a header and a footer.
<span   class="bold"><b>htmlpp</b></span> lets you construct very
complex headers and footers. This footer, taken from the htmlpp
documentation, builds hyperlinks to the first, previous, next and
last pages in the document, plus an index that lets the user jump
to any page in the document.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 .block footer
&lt;HR&gt;&lt;P&gt;
| $(*FIRST_PAGE=&lt;&lt;) | $(*PREV_PAGE=&lt;)
| $(*NEXT_PAGE=&gt;) | $(*LAST_PAGE=&gt;&gt;)
.build index
&lt;P&gt;&lt;A HREF="/index.htm"&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC="im0096c.gif" WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=36 ALT="iMatix"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
Designed by &lt;.HREF "/html/pieter.htm" "Pieter Hintjens"&gt;
&copy; 1997 iMatix
&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;
.endblock
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>.build index</b></span> command
builds the index by making a list of all the pages in the document.
With an .if command, we can show the current page in relationship
to the other pages. This is how I define the index:
<pre     class="programlisting">
.block index_open
&lt;BR&gt;
.block index_entry
.if "$(INDEX_PAGE)" eq "$(PAGE)"
| &lt;.EM $(INDEX_TITLE)&gt;
.else
| $(*INDEX_PAGE="$(INDEX_TITLE)")
.endif
.endblock
</pre>


This code is beginning to get a bit complex, but the results are
well worth the effort. The symbols in capital letters (e.g.,
<b  >$(PAGE)</b>, the file name for the current HTML
page) are supplied by htmlpp. Some of these symbols, such as
<b  >$(NEXT_PAGE)</b>, require that htmlpp go over the
document several times. In fact, htmlpp will run through the
document three or more times, until all cross references have been
resolved. This multi-pass approach can be a little slow, but it is
powerful enough to handle the footer block shown above.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2448f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Screen Shot
</p></div></div>

</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>.build toc</b></span> command
builds a table of contents, a vital part of any large document.
<span   class="bold"><b>htmlpp</b></span> comes with a small file,
contents.def, that does this job. To build the table of contents,
you do the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 .include contents.def
</pre><p>The contents.def file first defines three blocks (toc_open,
toc_entry and toc_close) and then does a
<span   class="bold"><b>.build toc</b></span>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
 .block toc_open
&lt;MENU&gt;
.block toc_entry
&lt;LI&gt;&lt;A HREF="$(TOC_HREF)"&gt;$(TOC_TITLE)&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
.block toc_close
&lt;/MENU&gt;
.end
&lt;P&gt;
.build toc
&lt;HR&gt;
</pre>


<span   class="bold"><b>htmlpp</b></span> uses such predefined blocks
for headers, footers, indexes, table of contents and other
constructions. You can define your own blocks in order to pull
standard chunks of HTML text into your pages. You can also use
<span   class="bold"><b>.include</b></span> commands, but this
practice can lead to the creation of many small files.
</p><p>The key to unlocking htmlpp's real power is learning a little
Perl. When you use the .if command, for instance, you use Perl. So,
I can write something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 .if $ENV {"RELEASE"} eq "test"
</pre><p>It's also possible to run Perl programs and pipe the output
into your HTML pages or to extend htmlpp's syntax with your own
functions. Finally, since htmlpp comes with source code under the
GNU General Purpose License, you can change the tool in any way you
wish.
</p><p>At the other extreme, you can use htmlpp in &ldquo;guru mode&rdquo; to
turn a simple text file into structured HTML pages. All you need to
do is mark the section headers.
<span   class="bold"><b>htmlpp</b></span> inserts a table of
contents, breaks the document into pages, adds headers and footers,
detects numbered and bulleted lists, paragraphs, tables and so on.
This is a quick and lazy way to produce useful HTML pages without
tagging every paragraph.</p><p>To use htmlpp, you have to be happy writing HTML by hand
(unless you work in guru mode). In return, you get an economical
way to maintain large web sites without losing any control over the
quality of your work.</p><p>To install and use htmlpp, you need Perl version 4 or 5.
Download htmlpp from http://www.imatix.com/ and unpack the .zip
file. The package comes with HTML pages describing how to install
and use. If you have questions, comments or suggestions, don't
