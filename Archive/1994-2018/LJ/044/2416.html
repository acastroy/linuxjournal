    Using a Perl script and World Wide Web, Mr. Griffin shows us
    how to determine which users are hogging the disk space.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a8d580.0x1b85608"></a></h2></div></div><p>A job that most system administrators
have to perform at one stage or another is the implementation of a
disk-quota policy. Being a maintainer of quite a few machines
(mostly Linux and Solaris, but also AIX) without system enforced
quotas, I need an automatic way of tracking disk quotas. To this
end, I created a Perl script to regularly check users' disk usage
and compile a list of the biggest hogs of disk space. Hopefully, in
this way, I can politely convince people to reduce the size of
their home directories when they get too large.
</p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>du</b></span> command summarizes
disk usage for a given directory hierarchy. When run in each user's
home directory, it reports how much disk space that directory is
occupying. At first, I wrote a shell script to run du in a number
of user directories, with an <span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span>
back end to provide nice formatting of the output. This method
proved difficult to maintain when new users were added to the
system. Users' home directories were unfortunately located in
different places on each operating system.</p><p>Perl provided a convenient method of rewriting the shell/awk
scripts into a single executable, which not only provided more
power and flexibility but also ran faster. Perl's integration of
standard Unix system calls and C-library functions (such as
<span   class="bold"><b>getpwnam()</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>getgrname()</b></span>) makes it perfectly
suited to this sort of task. In this article, I will describe how I
used Perl as a solution for my particular need. The complete source
code for my Perl script is available by anonymous download in the
file ftp://ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue44/2416.tgz.</p><p>The first thing I did was make a list of the locations in
which users' home directories resided and put this list into a Perl
array. For each subdirectory of the directories in this array, a
disk-usage summary was required. This summary was obtained by using
the Perl <span   class="bold"><b>system</b></span> command to spawn
off a process running du.</p><p>The du output was redirected to a temporary file using the
common $$ syntax, which is replaced at run time by the PID of the
executing process. This guaranteed that multiple invocations of my
disk-usage script (while unlikely) would not clobber each other's
temporary working data.</p><p>All of the subdirectories were named after the user who owned
the account. This assumption made life a bit easier in writing the
Perl script, because I could skip users such as root, bin,
etc.</p><p>I now had, in my temporary file, a listing of disk usage and
a user name, one pair per line. I wanted to split these up into an
associated hash of users and disk usage, with users as the index
key. I also wanted to keep a running total of the entire disk usage
and the number of users. Once Perl had parsed all this information
from the temporary file, I could delete it.</p><p>I decided the Perl script would dump its output as an HTML
formatted page. This allowed me great flexibility in presentation
and permitted the information to be available over the local
Intranet&mdash;quite useful when dealing with multiple heterogeneous
environments.</p><p>Next, I had to decide which information I needed to present.
Obviously, the date when the script ran is important, and a sorted
table listing disk usage from largest to smallest is essential.
Printing the <span   class="emphasis"><em>GCOS</em></span> (general comprehensive
operating system) information field from the password file allowed
me to view both real names and user names. I also decided to
provide a hypertext link to the user's home page, if one existed.
To do this, I extracted their official home directory from the
password file and added the standard, user directory extensions to
it (typically, public_html or WWW).</p><p>Sorting in Perl usually involves the use of the &ldquo;spaceship&rdquo;
operator (<b  >&lt;=&gt;</b>). The
<span   class="bold"><b>sort</b></span> function sorts a list and
returns the sorted list value. It comes in many forms, but the form
used in my code is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sort sub_name list
</pre><p>where <span   class="bold"><b>sub_name</b></span> is a Perl
subroutine. <span   class="bold"><b>sub_name</b></span> is called
during element comparisons, and it must return an integer less
than, equal to or greater than zero, depending on the desired order
of the list elements. <span   class="bold"><b>sub_name</b></span> can
also be replaced with an in-line block of Perl code.
</p><p>Typically, sorting numerically in ascending order takes the
form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@NewList = sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } @List;
</pre><p>whereas sorting numerically in descending order takes the
form:
<pre     class="programlisting">
@NewList = sort { $b &lt;=&gt; $a } @List;
</pre>


I decided to make the page a bit flashier by adding a few of those
omnipresent colored ball GIFs. Green indicates that the user is
within allowed limits. Orange indicates that the user is in a
danger buffer zone&mdash;no man's land&mdash;in which they are dangerously
close to the red zone. The red ball indicates a user is over quota,
and, depending on the severity, multiple red balls may be awarded
to truly greedy users.
</p><p>Finally, I searched, using all the web-search engines, until
I found a suitable GIF image of a piglet, which I placed at the top
of the page.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2416f1.large.jpg"><img src="2416f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Disk Hog Screen Shot
</p></div></div><p>The only job left was to arrange to run the script nightly as
a <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span> job. This job must be run
as root in order to accurately assess the disk usage of each
user&mdash;otherwise directory permissions could give false results. To
edit root's cron entries (called a <b  >crontab</b>),
first be sure you have the environment variable
<b  >VISUAL</b> (or <b  >EDITOR</b>) set to
your favorite editor, then type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
crontab -e
</pre><p>Add the following single line to any existing crontab
entries:
<pre     class="programlisting">
0 0 * * * /home/sysadm/ivan/public_html/diskHog.pl
</pre>


The format of crontab entries is straightforward. The first five
fields are integers, specifying the minute (0-59), hour (0-23), day
of the month (1-31), month of the year (1-12) and day of the
week(0-6, 0=Sunday). The use of an asterisk as a wild card to match
all values is permitted, as is specifying a list of elements
separated by commas or a range specified by start and end
(separated by a dash). The sixth field is the actual program to be
scheduled.
</p><p>A script of this size (with multiple invocations of du) takes
some time to process. As a result, it is best scheduled with
cron&mdash;I have it set to run once a day on most machines (generally
during the night, when user activity is low). I believe this script
shows the potential of using Perl, cron and the WWW to report
system statistics. I have also coded a variant of it that performs
an analysis of web-server log files. This script has served me well
for many months, and I am confident it will serve other system
administrators too.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>This article was first published in Issue 18 of LinuxGazette.com,
