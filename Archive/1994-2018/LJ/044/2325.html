Manager++ (RDM++, formerly db_Vista), a database management library
for C, Raima Object Manager(ROM), a persistent class library for
C++, and the Velocis database server, which supports both the RDM++
API and ANSI SQL. All three support transaction logging and
recovery, compound keys and time stamping. The most unique feature
of the Raima line-up is the combination of pointer and relational
data navigation. I tested all three using Caldera's OpenLinux
Standard 1.1 on a DEC P-90 with 40MB RAM. I'll cover the RDM++ and
Velocis server in this review.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2909580.0x2a01a28"></a>RDM++ Installation</h2></div></div><p>The installation is a snap. Just unpack the two floppies
using <b  >tar</b> and run the
<b  >makeall</b> shell script. RDM++
compiles with no significant errors. I had one minor gripe, the
makeall shell script should ask for extra compile flags; I would
have liked to add a <b  >-O3</b> flag.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2909580.0x2a01c38"></a>The RDM++ API</h2></div></div><p>To create databases, begin with a .ddl file that defines the
schema for the database. Tables are defined in a format that is
very similar to STRUCT in C. Also, defined in the .dll file are
sets. Sets define pointers to other records in the database. So,
one record in a table can point directly to another without
joining. This combination of tables (relational data model) and
sets (network-pointer data model) is where RDM++ really shines.
Using sets to point to other records is like having a permanent
predefined <b  >join</b> between tables and
can speed up your application compared to the process of iterating
over tables to create joins at runtime. In practice, I found that
having joins built into the database produced shorter and cleaner
code than similar applications using ISAM libraries. Once the .ddl
files are built, the <b  >ddlp</b> utility
compiles a database dictionary and header files that supply
constants needed by your application from the database.</p><p>The C API for RDM++ is a snap to learn, as all the function
calls start with d_ and are very intuitive. To open a database,
just call <b  >d_open</b>; to read a
record, <b  >d_recread</b>. Don't think
that because the API is intuitive that it's not rich&mdash;there are
over 200 functions. The learning curve is very short; I was able to
produce simple C applications within a couple of hours. One of the
biggest aids in learning the API was the
<b  >dal</b> utility that allows d_ calls
to be entered at the command line, just as they are written in
sources. Almost any of the d_ function calls can be run
interactively, and the results can be seen right away.</p><p>Another great time saver is the db_QUERY utility. This allows
reports to be produced from RDM++ databases using SQL. Both tables
and sets can be accessed from db_QUERY&mdash;sets appear as SQL views.
You can use it either interactively or with canned query files. The
neatest capability is that you can embed db_QUERY inside C
applications. I used it at the command line to work out my queries.
Then with a few function calls the same report is generated inside
of my C application. For simplicity, the functions all start with
q_ and there are only twelve of them.</p><p>I found this whole system of creating a database easy to
understand and a joy to use. The only piece missing is a GUI report
writer. Raima makes a fairly good one for MS Windows, but not for
X.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2909580.0x2a02000"></a>RDM++ Runtime</h2></div></div><p>Single-user applications can just be executed; however, to
use the RDM++ multi-user mode, a lock manager is required. The lock
manager runs in a separate process and manages the file locks for
all the users of your application. The multi-user mode worked well.
Record-level locking is not enforced by the lock manager, so you'll
have to limit the number of users to 20 or less.</p><p>This is the one area in which the RDM++ falls short. If
serious multi-user applications are going to be built with RDM++,
you need record locks. I realize that there is some overhead with
this option, but it seems well worth the cost.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2909580.0x2a02160"></a>Velocis Server</h2></div></div><p>Velocis is a back office power house. It supports all of the
standard stuff that you'd expect in the best commercial database
servers: transaction processing, ACID transactions, record and
table locks, stored procedures, triggers and hot backups. It also
supports a wide set of APIs: RDM++ C API, ROM C++ API (for storing
C++ objects), ANSI 89 and most of the 92 SQL API and SQL Access
Group's Call Level Interface (SAG-CLI, which is the same as
Microsoft's ODBC level 1 API). In addition, the server is easily
extended with C or C++.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2909580.0x2a02268"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Installing Velocis was fairly easy. Once the disks are
unpacked using tar, run the
<b  >install</b> script which creates two
files: rdshome.sh and rdshome.csh. These shell scripts export all
the environment variables that Velocis needs to run. I copied the
contents of rdshome.sh to /etc/profile so that it's available
system wide. Each Velocis server (you can run multiple servers)
must have a host alias and a port of the same name defined in the
/etc/services file. Just fire up the server and you are ready to
get started.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2909580.0x2a023c8"></a>Administration</h2></div></div><p>Velocis is administered from the
<b  >rdsadm</b> command-line utility.
Velocis is fairly easy to use and understand, but the rdsadm
utility is cumbersome and doesn't do justice to the quality of the
server. Raima should supply an X windows GUI administration tool
with Velocis.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2909580.0x2a02528"></a>Unique Features</h2></div></div><p>Velocis is a dream for C programmers because the server
extension modules (EM) and user-defined functions (UDF) are all
implemented in C.</p><p>UDF are C shared libraries that contain scalar or aggregate
functions that can be called from SQL. UDF use the standard SAG-CLI
and are registered by using the SQL
<b  >create function</b> call. Once registered, UDF can be used like any
other SQL function.</p><p>UDF can be used in conjunction with the SQL
<b  >check</b> clause to create triggers. Triggers run
on the server whenever a table is changed. Thus, by using the
<b  >check</b> clause when tables are created, UDF and
built-in functions can be executed automatically on the server.
This is a great way to ensure that custom business logic is
enforced on your database.</p><p>The Velocis server can also be customized outside the SQL
system with extension modules. EM are essentially the same as
user-defined functions but are invoked by clients directly using
RPC calls. They are independent of the SQL system. As a matter of
fact the whole SQL interface is an extension module. This modular
design makes Velocis an excellent choice for vertical market
applications where heavy customization is required.</p><p>Velocis also supports stored SQL procedures with the
<b  >create procedure</b> call,
allowing a group of SQL statements to be executed with a single
function call.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2325f2.large.jpg"><img src="2325f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Conclusion
</p></div></div><p>Raima's products are all winners. I especially like the RDM++
API. The .dll set up and the d_ functions are very easy to learn
and are rich enough in features to be taken seriously. Even with
Velocis I'd be tempted to use the low level d_ functions in place
of SQL. SQL is still nice to have for reporting and system
administration. It is, after all, almost the universal database
language. Raima only misses on a couple of counts. First, the lack
of GUI tools for Velocis, an administration tool and report writer
for X Windows as a minimum are required for serious back office
use. Second, Raima needs to beef up its Internet tools. Currently,
there is only a Perl interface for Velocis. Raima should consider
doing a JDBC type 4 driver and an HTML scripting tool like PHP/FI
or Scriptease for ADABAS D. All in all Raima is a winner and worth
a look for your next project.</p></div></div>
