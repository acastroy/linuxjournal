    This report on the HP conference freatures the announcement
    by Hewlett Packard of a port of MkLinux to its HP PA-RISC
    machines.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c1580.0x2ab92f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>It may seem odd to be reading about an HP
conference in <i  >Linux Journal</i>. The fact of the
matter is that interest in Linux is growing world wide. Many
hardware vendors are interested in Linux because, quite frankly, it
scares them. Even more importantly there were a couple of events at
this conference that underscore some very important trends in the
computing industry.
</p><p>Prior to the conference I was excited to attend a white paper
presentation by Chip Richards (richards@eng.iac.honeywell.com)
called &ldquo;A Place for Linux&rdquo;, which occurred on the fourth day. His
discussion centered on the current uses of Linux at Honeywell.
Currently, Honeywell is using Linux as a design platform for
several applications that are then ported to HP-UX once the
development is completed. This approach allows them to capitalize
their investment in PC hardware while keeping development costs
down. His presentation was well received by a group that I would
estimate at approximately 100 people. The attendance was good
considering the conference had approximately 1200 attendees.</p><p>There were three very interesting keynote speakers. The first
was Stephen Wallach from Convex technologies. The second was Dr.
Ira Goldstein of Hewlett Packard and the third was Robert Cringely,
author.</p><p>The evening started off with Dr. Wallach's speech. Dr.
Wallach is not only the head of Convex, but also its founder. He
talked about the recent acquisition of Convex by HP and the
advantages the merger would bring to both companies. Also discussed
was the new HP Exemplar-class server based on Convex technology.
Dr. Wallach is a very interesting presenter who clearly didn't have
enough time for everything he wanted to say.</p><p>The second presenter was Dr. Ira Goldstein, Chief Technology
Officer, CSO in HP. His presentation dealt primarily with the
Internet and imagery. He discussed some new technologies for image
production and transport that are being developed jointly by HP,
Microsoft and Kodak. The presented ideas seemed sound and would
minimize many of the performance problems that we have today when
downloading images from the Internet. This new technology would not
only improve the ability to download quickly, but also allow you to
resize images dynamically with very little loss in quality.</p><p>The most astounding revelation came during Dr. Goldstein's
presentation&mdash;he discussed a new port of the Linux operating system
to the HP PA-RISC architecture. He and his development team had
decided to port the Carnegie Mellon Mach kernel to HP PA-RISC in
order to use it for their imagery work. Once the port was finished
they began looking for an OS layer. Since HP-UX is bound tightly to
its monolithic kernel, it was excluded from consideration. Knowing
that last year Apple helped produce a Linux layer that would
interoperate with the Mach kernel (MkLinux), they decided to go in
that direction for their operating system. Goldstein's team went
one porting step further and took the actual Apple Linux source
code and ported it easily to the new HP environment. The results
are a new port of Linux that will run on
<span   class="bold"><b>any</b></span> PA-RISC based machine.</p><p>Goldstein went on to question the audience about how many
people might be interested in this port. I would say that about 50
hands went up. The reality is that companies can't always replace
their computing base after three years, even with hardware
obsolescence. Those companies that cannot afford new hardware want
to get the best usage possible from the machines they have.
Sometimes this comes through the use of sources such as Linux.
Additional information on this project and Hewlett Packard's
sponsorship can be found at http://www.gr.osf.org/mklinux/.</p><p>The final presenter was Robert X. Cringely. Cringely is the
author of the book &ldquo;Triumph of the Nerds in Silicon Valley&rdquo; that
was recently produced as a PBS special for television. By and
large, this was a very entertaining presentation. Cringely is a
sleeper. He was introduced as a writer and TV personality. What we
didn't find out until well within the presentation is that he is a
computer consultant, that he was employee #12 at Apple, that he
owns and directs a company building Internet-based software and
that he is a very entertaining presenter. He discussed his beliefs
for the near-term growth of the computer industry and answered many
questions from the audience, sharing the stage with Steve Wallach
for the Q&amp;A session.</p><p>Afterwards, I had an opportunity to speak with both Dr.
Goldstein and Mr. Cringely. Dr. Goldstein indicated that once his
team had completed their work, HP had been more than willing to
freely give the port without formal support to the Internet
community (see URL above). He also indicated that in the future if
there is a good showing of interest in this port, someone from HP
might upgrade the Mach kernel and Linux environment as changes
arise. Dr. Goldstein also went on to suggest that many companies
might be interested in this port to help them leverage their
existing technology. While not necessarily interested in providing
Linux, HP is still interested in keeping their workstations on the
desktop as long as possible. The bottom line is that the
workstation still says HP no matter what OS it is running. This
concept provides a way for the company to keep the customer
interested in the lean times when equipment budgets are low.</p></div></div>
