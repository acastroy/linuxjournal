includes an e-mail about the product review of Bentley Systems'
MicroStation95 [July 1997] that I found quite interesting. In
particular, in the last paragraph the writer, Dave Blondell, says:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Linux is now at an awkward moment. If business

That is exactly the question that we all must answer if Linux is to
continue to expand in use and become a major player in the OS game.
</p><p>While there is probably more than one answer to this
question, one of the best and easiest is marketing. When we, as
at-home Linux users, promote Linux in our workplace as an
efficient, reliable and inexpensive alternative to the other
available operating systems, we take the first step in solving the
conundrum posed above.</p><p>Each month <i  >LJ</i> includes a &ldquo;Linux Means
Business&rdquo; article for the express purpose of letting the world
know the many ways in which Linux is being used in the workplace.
Bentley Systems might be interested in the fact that Linux is being
used to design items as diverse as clothing [&ldquo;Using Linux at
Lectra-Syst&egrave;mes&rdquo;, Pierre Ficheux, April 1997] and
integrated circuit boards [&ldquo;An Introduction to IC Design Under
Linux&rdquo;, Toby Schaffer and Alan W. Glaser, July 1997]. These
articles and others [e.g., &ldquo;IMEC/NIT&rdquo;, Erwin Glassee and Rudi
Cartuyvels, December 1996] show that there are companies doing CAD
work using Linux that would provide a market for products such as
Bentley's MicroStation95.</p><p>Last month, Martin Sjolin provided us with a great way to
promote Linux at work [&ldquo;Linux Expo at UBS&rdquo;, November 1997]. Mr.
Sjolin along with other Linux users put on an Expo at the Union
Bank of Switzerland where they are employed. His description of the
steps they took to put on the Expo serves as a blueprint for others
to follow.</p><p>In June of this year, the Atlanta Linux Enthusiasts
(http://www.ale.com/) joined with Linux International to put on a
successful, national trade show devoted exclusively to Linux: The
Atlanta Linux Showcase. An article describing how your group can
organize a successful show like A.L.S. appeared in Issue 19 of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>
(http://www.ssc.com/lj/issue19/trade.html): &ldquo;User's Groups and
Trade Shows, Lessons from the Atlanta Linux Showcase&rdquo; by Andrew
Newton. This paper can also be found on the G.L.U.E. (Groups of
Linux Users Everywhere) web site at http://www.ssc.com/glue/. This
example makes the point that users' groups and Linux Advocacy teams
are always a good resource for inventive ideas for promotion&mdash;join
one today.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1027580.0x111f500"></a>Kelper's Day Parade</h2></div></div><p>On Sunday August 31, <i  >Linux Journal</i>
helped spread the word about Linux by sponsoring a float in the
annual Kelper's Day Parade in Pacific Beach, Washington. Now, I
have no idea what a Kelper is&mdash;a gatherer of kelp perhaps?&mdash;but I
had a lot of fun participating in the parade. My favorite float was
a front-loader with a dummy in the scoop and a sign that read:
&ldquo;Call 911. We Scoop and Run.&rdquo;</p><p><i  >LJ</i>'s contribution was a huge
<i  >Linux Journal</i> banner followed by Phil's old
blue Mercedes with a computer fastened to the top. A bunch of us
employees walked (and rode on the front fenders) the two-mile
parade route giving out Linux stickers, magazines and candy. (The
kids liked the candy the best.) Phil took pictures and, after the
parade, fed us barbecued salmon and beer&mdash;he's a nice guy, after
all. Next year he has offered to feed all the Linux geeks that show
up.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1027580.0x111f768"></a><i  >Linux Journal</i> CDs</h2></div></div><p>And now, for a little self-promotion&mdash;<i  >Linux Journal</i> has put together a CD containing a browser and
all of the 1996 issues in HTML format. This CD is a nice,
convenient way to keep all that great Linux information at your
fingertips in an easy-to-search format. It also takes up a lot less
space on your bookshelf than 12 printed magazines. Get yours
