    Mr. Bandel tells us all about users/groups, UIDs/GIDs,
    permissions and security. In short, how to successfully
    manage your users.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc514a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Once your system is installed and most of
the services configured, it's time to add users. You may not have
given this task much thought yet, but you should.
</p><p>If you're like many Linux beginners, you may not understand
the implications of giving someone access to your system. Perhaps,
for some time, you've been using a Unix variant, in which the basic
decisions have been handled for you. Indeed, some installation
programs, such as Caldera's <span   class="bold"><b>LISA</b></span>
(Linux Installation and System Administration), start the process
for you by adding a user during the install process and then allow
you to continue using it to add and delete users from the system.
So what else is there to know?</p><p>For starters, adding users entails thinking about how you
wish to administer the system overall. Security is directly
affected by such things as groups and passwords. Their
administration shouldn't be left to chance or the whims of the
installation program&mdash;at least, not without exploring their
impact.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc516b8"></a>/etc/passwd</h2></div></div><p>When you add a user, however you do it (I'll mention some
programs later), you add an entry to the /etc/passwd file. This
file consists of seven colon-separated fields, specified all on one
line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
col:JkH7XmXwH6e/E:100:100:Bandel:/home/col:/bin/bash
</pre><p>The fields are: user login name, password, UID, GID, comment
(gecos) field, user's home directory and user's default shell.
</p><p>If you decide to edit the /etc/passwd file manually, please
be sure to make a backup copy first, so that if something goes
wrong, you can start over. In general, I recommend using one of the
programs specifically designed to edit the /etc/passwd file.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc518c8"></a>1. Login Name</h2></div></div><p>The first field is fairly self-explanatory. The system
matches this entry with the next field as the user's login
name/password pair. Each name must be unique. This is the only
field required to be unique; I will explain the implications of
keeping certain other fields unique below. Beyond that, making the
user name meaningful helps to quickly identify who sent a 10MB file
to the printer when the boss needs a hard copy of his budget for a
Board of Directors meeting in ten minutes. In most Unix variants,
including Linux, the login name is limited to 8 characters.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc519d0"></a>2. Password</h2></div></div><p>The second field is the password. This field can contain any
of a number of things, but normally contains an encrypted password.
The encrypted password must be 13 characters in length, composed of
a two character seed plus the encrypted password. Other entries
often seen in the password field include: &ldquo;*&rdquo;,&ldquo;LOCKED&rdquo; and
&ldquo;VOID&rdquo;. If you see an &ldquo;x&rdquo; in this field, you'll want to read
about shadow files below. These, or any other incorrect entries,
effectively lock this user out. If you wish to lock a user out
without losing the password they are using, you can insert an
apostrophe as the first character. An apostrophe can never be used
as part of the &ldquo;scrambled eggs&rdquo;, so apart from being illegal as
part of a seed, you have also made the field size 14 characters. To
allow the user access, just remove the apostrophe.</p><p>Also note that this field might be empty. Always check the
/etc/passwd file to ensure that the second field is not empty. A
field is defined as empty or NULL if the two colons delineating
this field are next to each other with nothing in between, not even
a space. If it is empty, no password is required to log in. The
implications of this are obvious.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc51b30"></a>3. UID</h2></div></div><p>The third field is the UID (user identification). Valid UID
ranges are from 0 to 65534. A UID of 0 has a special significance
to the system; it is the omnipotent &ldquo;superuser&rdquo;, a term derived
from the <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> (substitute user)
program normally used by a normal user to become root. When invoked
without an argument (user name) or with only a hyphen
(<b  >-</b>), root is the default.</p><p>A UID of 65534 is commonly reserved for &ldquo;nobody&rdquo;, a user
with no privileges as opposed to a non-privileged user. This UID is
often used for individuals accessing your system via FTP or
HTTP.</p><p>Custom dictates that the numbers 1 to 99 are reserved for
system users, such as wheel, daemon, lp, operator, news, mail, etc.
These numbers are more than sufficient for most system
requirements. Also, you may want to reserve 100 to 999 for
semi-privileged (for lack of a better term) users. These users are
administrators who don't need total root powers, but who do some
administration and thus need more privileges than those given to
non-privileged users. Reserve 1000 to 9999 for local users and
10000 to 65534 for remote users (if any).</p><p>Reserving groups of numbers for particular users helps if you
ever need to search through logs for suspicious user activity. Some
distributions, like Caldera, start UIDs at 100, others, like Red
Hat, at 500, and still others, like Debian, at 1000 for
non-privileged users. Just decide on a scheme and stick to it.
Since each distribution does its own thing, in order to mix
distributions within an organization, you have to intervene
manually if the systems are networked. This is particularly true if
you want to use NIS or NFS to mount common directories (e.g.,
/var/spool/mail, /home).</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, the UID field does not have to be
unique. In fact, one method that keeps &ldquo;wanna-be&rdquo; system crackers
busy is to use the technique discussed above and put an apostrophe
as the first character in the password field for root. Then create
another entry, perhaps tuber, with a UID of 0. Some systems require
the root entry to exist and be the first entry.</p><p>But beware: a non-unique field can cause problems. For
example, if you are logged in as tuber (UID 0) and activate a
password-protected screen lock, when you attempt to unlock it, you
will find you've outsmarted yourself. The kernel knows you by your
UID; it looks up UID 0 beginning with the top of the /etc/passwd
file and finds it as the first entry corresponding to
&ldquo;root&rdquo;--that's where it stops; it doesn't look any further. But
root's password has been locked with an invalid entry. At this
point, your choices are to telnet in and kill the screen-lock
process or to reboot the machine. The other possibility for getting
out is to use an unlocked virtual terminal if you have one running
to which you can switch. (Sometimes, the &ldquo;extra&rdquo; virtual
terminals come in handy.)</p><p>Before I leave UIDs, here are two more things to think about.
First, if you have any &ldquo;rhosts&rdquo; files with references to other
systems outside your own network, make sure your user names are
unique not only in your system, but between systems. If you have a
jonesd (for Donna Jones) and the other system has a jonesd (for
Danny Jones), and they use <span   class="bold"><b>rlogin</b></span>
to remotely log in to each other's systems, they'll have access to
each other's files (as the other person). These files can cause
many problems and probably should not be used.</p><p>The second thing is the <span   class="bold"><b>find</b></span>
command, which is used extensively by systems-administration
programs and can be used to find user's files for deletion or
changing owners (<span   class="bold"><b>chown</b></span>) before (or
after) the files become orphaned. Learn this command, and
incorporate it into your tool box. See the side bar &ldquo;A Few Words
About the Find Command&rdquo;.</p><p><a href="2403s1.html" target="_self">A Few Words about the Find
Command</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc52108"></a>4. GID</h2></div></div><p>The fourth field is the primary GID (group identification)
number. Every user belongs to a group. Some distributions use a
common group such as &ldquo;users&rdquo; to which everyone belongs. Others
create &ldquo;private groups&rdquo; and assign each user to his own private
group as their primary or default group. Caldera uses a common
group, while Red Hat and Debian use private groups. I would
recommend reading the Red Hat Users Manual, available via anonymous
FTP from ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/redhat-4.1/Users-Guide/ in
various formats. A discussion of private groups as they relate to
easing the system administration burden can be found in this
manual.</p><p>To discover the groups they belong to, users can type
<b  >groups</b> at the command prompt. The first group
name returned is the default group. Files saved by that user will,
by default, have the group identifier set to the first value
returned unless the subdirectory has the &ldquo;setgid&rdquo; bit turned
on.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc522c0"></a>5. Comment</h2></div></div><p>The fifth field is a comment, which usually contains the
user's full name. You may see this field referred to as a gecos
(General Electric Comprehensive Operating System) field. Shadow
files sometimes use this field for something other than a user's
name, but only under special circumstances.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc523c8"></a>6. Home Directory</h2></div></div><p>The sixth field is the user's home directory. The
<span   class="bold"><b>cd</b></span> command given with no argument
or with the tilde (~) as an argument will move the user to this
directory. This directory must have a full path name, i.e., start
at the root and go down. One notable exception to this rule is the
system user &ldquo;bin&rdquo;, which has a relative path of bin as the home
directory, because several bin directories exist on the
system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc52528"></a>7. Default Shell</h2></div></div><p>The last field is the user's default shell. Most Linux
distributions (in fact, all of those I am aware of) default to
bash, the Bourne Again Shell. For most users, this is probably the
best overall shell. C programmers tend to like the syntax of one of
the C shells (csh or tcsh), but for writing scripts, most users
will do better with bash. If you need a user to have a system entry
for any purpose (perhaps a WWW database account), but don't want
him to be able to log in, you can specify /bin/false as his shell
(as is usually done with the nobody account). The shell can also be
a program that runs when the user logs in, but it would be the only
thing the user could do&mdash;exiting the program would log him out. If
you choose this option, be aware that some programs allow users to
start a shell from within the program. If the program &ldquo;shells
out&rdquo; to a true shell, then the user has a back door into the
system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc52630"></a>Shadow Files</h2></div></div><p>A complete discussion of shadow files is beyond the scope of
this article. However, just to give you some idea of what they are
and why they were created, I offer the following. The /etc/passwd
file is &ldquo;world&rdquo; readable; anyone can make a copy of it. &ldquo;So
what,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;the passwords are encrypted and can't be used.&rdquo;
Not true. Most users, in particular those who choose their own
passwords, choose passwords that can be guessed or broken by a
&ldquo;dictionary attack&rdquo; --that is, by using a program such as
<span   class="bold"><b>cops</b></span>, an attacker can run a
dictionary through <span   class="bold"><b>crypt</b></span> using the
seed from the password to see if they get a match.</p><p>When the shadow file is used to maintain passwords, it is not
world readable and cannot be copied off the system. An &ldquo;x&rdquo; in the
password field tells you that this system uses shadow passwords.
The shadow file also contains information about when the password
was last changed, if the user will be forced to change it and how
often (password expiration date), etc. Periodic forced password
changes reduce risks posed by users who do not guard their
passwords well.</p><p>Most recent Linux distributions include the PAM (pluggable
authentication modules) libraries. PAM doesn't require applications
to be &ldquo;PAM aware&rdquo; in order to function correctly, but these are
only libraries and do require programs written with them. The
shadow suite requires numerous programs to be recompiled or
replaced with shadow-aware applications. If you need this kind of
security, you need to do some serious reading.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc52898"></a>/etc/group</h2></div></div><p>The /etc/group file is also a colon-separated list consisting
of only four fields: group name, group password, GID and members.
The group name/password pair works the same as the /etc/passwd
file. However, groups usually don't have passwords associated with
them. A quick look at your /etc/group file will reveal the second
field doesn't have an entry. Adding passwords to groups doesn't
normally enhance security, since users are even more lax about
group passwords (why not, everyone knows it) than their own.</p><p>The original group implementation in Unix allowed a user to
belong to only one group at a time, and they changed group if
required. Now, belonging to several groups at a time is common, so
this has little relevance in most situations. Files are saved as
the users' primary group, but can be changed manually using the
<span   class="bold"><b>chgrp</b></span> command or via the setgid
bit on the directory. The third field is the group-identification
number and is functionally equivalent to its /etc/passwd UID
counterpart. The fourth field consists of a comma separated list of
group members (no spaces are used following the comma).</p><p>One last note on the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.
Several distributions I've worked with lately have been adding a
line to the bottom of the file like this: +:::::: (The /etc/group
file will only have four colons.) This line is added so that NIS
databases are appended if no matching entries are found for
user/password pair. This <span   class="bold"><b>must</b></span> be
the last line in the file. Entries following this line are not
read. I highly recommend that if you are not using NIS, you delete
this line and use <span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> to change
permissions on <span   class="bold"><b>ypbind</b></span> so that it
is not executable. If you run ypbind without a properly set up NIS
server and the proper databases, you are vulnerable to someone who
can trick your machine into binding to his server and reading his
NIS maps to gain unauthorized access to your system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0xc52bb0"></a>Adding and deleting users/groups</h2></div></div><p>All of the Linux distributions come with facilities for
automating the process of adding, modifying and removing users. All
include shell scripts or programs such as
<span   class="bold"><b>adduser</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>useradd</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>usermod</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>userdel</b></span>. Some distributions,
notably Caldera and Red Hat, come with additional programs to do
the job. Caldera uses its <span   class="bold"><b>LISA</b></span>
program to handle adding and deleting users. Red Hat's
<span   class="bold"><b>usercfg</b></span>, for use in a graphical
(X11) environment, not only handles user additions and deletions,
but also helps manage groups.</p><p>All accomplish certain basic chores beyond just adding a line
to the /etc/passwd file and appropriate entries to the /etc/group
file. Given the sensitivity of the /etc/passwd file and the
consequences of corrupting this file, that alone would warrant its
use. A system no one (not even root) can log into isn't much use.
In fact, if you do edit /etc/passwd with an editor, you shouldn't
keep it open long. This file is accessed by numerous programs for
login and authentication purposes, and holding this file open
(especially if another user decides to change his password) could
cause system instability.</p><p>All these scripts and programs prompt you through the
information needed to create the new account. If you need to add or
delete group accounts, the
<span   class="bold"><b>groupadd</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>groupdel</b></span>
(<span   class="bold"><b>delgroup</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>addgroup</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>groupmod</b></span>, etc.) programs can be
found on most systems to accomplish this task.</p><p>The use of Network Information Services (NIS), formerly known
as the Yellow Pages (a trademark of British Telecom) and still
carrying the &ldquo;yp&rdquo; prefix on the programs, will necessarily change
some of the procedures I've discussed, but the basics remain the
same. NIS is used at larger sites to ease the administrative burden
of pushing changes to each machine. But accounts still need to be
set up. NIS just centralizes and distributes files from the master
server instead of changing files on each machine individually. If
you do work at a large site that uses NIS, you'll still have some
normal accounts set up on each machine for those times when
maintenance requirements dictate bringing the machine up in single
user or non-networked modes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0x104b3d8"></a>Security</h2></div></div><p>Since I've been mentioning security from the beginning of
this article, I thought I would mention a few programs to help you
maintain security on your system.</p><p>The first program, <span   class="bold"><b>npasswd</b></span>
(no relation to the file created by reversing the shadow password
conversion), does some sanity checking when users change their
password. This program is used in place of the regular
<span   class="bold"><b>passwd</b></span> program by renaming the
passwd binary (/usr/bin/passwd not /etc/passwd) to something like
passwd.orig and creating a link to npasswd from passwd.</p><p>Another program you may be interested in is
<span   class="bold"><b>pwgen</b></span>. This program generates
random passwords containing mixed upper and lower case characters,
numbers and legal (for a password) punctuation. Personally, I find
these passwords too difficult to remember, and since writing them
down is a security no-no, I devise my own (hopefully) secure
passwords.</p><p>I mention the <span   class="bold"><b>pwdutils</b></span>
package only for those using NIS. This package contains NIS
compatible programs. Those contemplating using NIS or shadow files
need to ensure that the programs they use for system administration
(particularly user administration) work with NIS or the shadow
suite. Above all, before you begin installing either NIS or the
shadow suite, RTFM&mdash;read the fine manual (and keep an emergency
boot disk handy).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0x104b748"></a>/etc/skel</h2></div></div><p>Among the myriad things you can do that will make your life
easier as a systems administrator is to maintain certain files and
subdirectories. One such subdirectory that is often overlooked is
/etc/skel. This subdirectory is the skeleton used by all (that I'm
aware of) scripts and programs to create the new user's $HOME
directory. You've seen how administration programs add users to
/etc/passwd. You've noticed that at the same time a /home/$USER
subdirectory is created with proper permissions and a few common
files, such as .bashrc, .cshrc, etc. All this is done by copying
/etc/skel with all its files and subdirectories to the user's new
home directory and changing the ownership (chown) to the new user.
Use the /etc/skel directory to keep all the files you wish new
users to have&mdash;maybe a default .fvwmrc for their X sessions or some
changes to their .bashrc files. Then the new user will be ready to
start working as soon as you've run the
<span   class="bold"><b>adduser</b></span> program.</p><p>If you view some of the programs I've discussed, you'll note
some are binaries and some are scripts. I prefer to use a modified
adduser script in which I have included a couple of lines for
something I occasionally forget. My Caldera boxes run a modified
<span   class="bold"><b>fvwm</b></span> (from LST) that writes to the
file /var/run/xlaunch/$USER/background-:0.0. While not a fatal
error if the directory doesn't exist, I don't like to see error
messages scrolling through my console box. So, my modified script
includes two lines to create this subdirectory and then
<span   class="bold"><b>touch</b></span> the file name. You can
modify your scripts in a similar manner.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb59580.0x104b9b0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Once set up, user administration is not that difficult. The
necessary tools are installed by default, and some nice GUI
programs make the task almost enjoyable. A well-thought out
user-administration policy will help you enhance security while
making the system friendlier and easier to use for both you and the
users. Create some accounts and introduce your friends to the joys
of &ldquo;Linuxing&rdquo;.</p></div></div>
