    This article is an introduction to a second CGI module,
    CGI_Lite, that is not as feature rich as CGI but is much
    smaller in size and therefore more efficient for use in
    small-scale projects.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1697580.0x178f3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>This month, we will look at CGI_Lite, a
Perl 5 module written by Shishir Gundavaram. CGI_Lite is one of
several modules available for CGI programmers; the best known of
the bunch is CGI.pm, written by Lincoln Stein. Indeed, I have used
CGI.pm in nearly every &ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo; column, as well as in many
programs over the last few years, on many web sites.
</p><p>While CGI.pm is useful and rich in features, it is also
large, weighing in at a hefty 153KB. On my Red Hat 4.2 system with
40MB of RAM, starting Perl 5 and loading CGI.pm uses about 2.7
percent of the physical memory&mdash;over 1MB&mdash;before I have even
allocated any data structures. On a popular Web server, it is easy
to imagine how many CGI programs running simultaneously would lead
to a heavy load, both on the CPU and on the server's memory,
leading to a significant slow-down.</p><p>There are a number of solutions to this problem, including
using a language other than Perl for CGI programs. This month,
though, we will look at another solution: CGI_Lite.pm, a module
that does less than CGI.pm but is much smaller and faster.
CGI_Lite.pm takes a mere 17KB on disk, and when loaded into memory
along with Perl 5, takes only 2.0 percent of the physical memory on
my system, about 800KB. This is still a relatively large amount of
memory, but given that invoking Perl 5 uses about 560KB, it strikes
me as a reasonable trade-off.</p><p>CGI_Lite.pm is not a panacea; it leaves out a number of
useful features that have made their way into CGI.pm over the
years. However, if your CGI programs require only a limited set of
features and you would like to keep your programs as trim as
possible, you might want to consider using CGI_Lite in at least
some of your programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1697580.0x178f608"></a>Getting Started with CGI_Lite.pm</h2></div></div><p>Before you can use CGI_Lite, you need to get a copy from CPAN
(the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network), a set of FTP and web
servers that make Perl code, documentation and utilities available
to the public for free. As of this writing, the latest version of
CGI_Lite is 1.8, meaning that you can retrieve it from the URL
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/CGI/CGI_Lite-1.8.tar.gz.</p><p>If CGI_Lite has been updated by the time you read this, you
might need to change the numbers in the last part of the URL. Once
you have retrieved the module, you can unpack it with the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -zxvf CGI_Lite-1.8.tar.gz
</pre><p>which uncompresses (<b  >-z</b>) verbosely
(<b  >-v</b>) the file (<b  >-f</b>). This
action creates CGI_Lite-1.8 on my system. Then perform the standard
Perl module installation as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install
</pre>


Note that you may have to be logged in as root in order to install
CGI_Lite on your system.
</p><p>Once the module is installed, you can use it in any program
by including the line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use CGI_Lite;
</pre><p>at the top of your program.
</p><p>Of course, including a module is the easy part&mdash;learning how
to use it can be a bit more complicated. Let's see how to use
CGI_Lite.pm by creating a simple program, one which expects to
receive a user's first name from an HTML form. When the form is
submitted, the program prints a short personalized greeting to the
user. If you are wondering why we are starting with an HTML form
and the POST method, rather than the simpler GET method, stay
tuned&mdash;it is harder than you might think.</p><p><a href="2557l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. HTML Form with Single
Text Field</a></p><p>Listing 1 is a simple HTML form, containing a single text
field called <span   class="emphasis"><em>firstname</em></span>, that we can use for
our test. When a user clicks on the submit button in this form, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>firstname</em></span> text field is sent via the POST
method to the program called /cgi-bin/hello.pl. Listing 2 shows one
way in which we might write
<span   class="bold"><b>hello.pl</b></span> using CGI_Lite.pm.</p><p><a href="2557l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Initial Version of Perl
Program hello.pl</a></p><p>In short, this program executes the following actions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Imports the CGI_Lite module.</p></li><li><p>Creates an instance of CGI_Lite.</p></li><li><p>Retrieves the HTML form elements into a hash, also
known as an &ldquo;associative array&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Uses the value of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>firstname</em></span> form element to return a string to
the user.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1697580.0x1790160"></a>Dissecting hello.pl</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have gotten an overall picture of what is
happening in the above program, let's look at this in greater
detail, with a bit of attention to some of the differences between
CGI.pm and CGI_Lite.pm.</p><p>In CGI.pm, we can retrieve form elements using the
<span   class="bold"><b>param</b></span> method. When invoked in a
scalar context, param allows us to retrieve the value of a single
HTML form element. For example, if we have defined
<span   class="bold"><b>$query</b></span> to be an instance of CGI,
we can place the value of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>firstname</em></span> field
in the <b  >$firstname</b> variable with the following
statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $firstname = $query-&gt;param("<span   class="emphasis"><em>firstname</em></span>");
</pre><p>If we invoke param in an array context, then we get a list of
all form elements that were submitted to the program. For example,
if we want to put the names of all HTML form elements into the
array <b  >@names</b>, we can do so with the following
statement:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my @names = $query-&gt;param;
</pre>


We can then iterate through <b  >@names</b> to retrieve
and print the value associated with each form element, as in:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $element = "";
    foreach $element (@names)
    {
        print "&lt;P&gt;$element = ",
         $query-&gt;param($element), "&lt;/P&gt;\n";
    }
</pre>


We can accomplish this with CGI_Lite.pm, but in a slightly
different way. CGI_Lite.pm has a single method for retrieving form
elements, one which uses hashes rather than a mixture of scalars
and arrays. To retrieve form elements, we use the method
<span   class="bold"><b>parse_form_data</b></span>, which returns its
results in a hash. Retrieving individual form elements is thus a
two-step process. First we put all of the elements into the hash,
and then we retrieve the one in which we are interested:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my %FORM = parse_form_data;
my $firstname = $FORM{"firstname"};
</pre>


If we want to get a list of the form elements that were sent, we
can use the keys function. Thus, to put the names of the form
elements in the array <b  >@names</b>, we can type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my @names = keys %FORM;
</pre>


We can even get them in alphabetical order, by prefacing keys with
a call to sort:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my @names = sort keys %FORM;
</pre>


We can print the names and values of all form elements by iterating
through <b  >@names</b> and retrieving the values in
which we are interested:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $element = "";
foreach $element (@names)
{
print ",&lt;P&gt;$element = ", $FORM{$element},
        "&lt;/P&gt;\n";
}
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1697580.0x17908f0"></a>Creating Variables from Form Elements</h2></div></div><p>If we know that we want to put one or more of the form
elements into scalar variables (and not keep them in the hash), we
can do so by calling the method
<span   class="bold"><b>create_variables</b></span>. For instance, in
our example above, we first had to use parse_form_data in order to
get the form elements into the hash %FORM. Then we had to assign
<b  >$firstname</b> in a separate step. If we had wanted
to assign 10 variables based on the contents of the form, we would
have needed to make 10 separate assignments, which is rather
inefficient.</p><p>To get around this problem, we can use the
<span   class="bold"><b>create_variables</b></span> method, which
automatically creates local variables for us. If we want to turn
each form element into its own variable, we can simply
invoke:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$query-&gt;create_variables(\%FORM);
</pre><p>When this method returns, we have a new variable defined for
each element that was in the submitted form. Thus, if we have a
form element named <span   class="emphasis"><em>firstname</em></span>, the value
associated with that element is now available via the variable
<b  >$firstname</b>. The backslash in front of %FORM
gives us a reference to the hash, a new feature in Perl 5
documented in great detail in the Perl manual pages (available by
typing <b  >man perlref</b> on most Linux systems).
</p><p>There is one potential problem with create_variables, namely,
your program might define variables with the same names as one or
more form elements. For example, Listing 3 is a version of hello.pl
in which we give the variable <b  >$firstname</b> a value
and call create_variables on the submitted form that included an
element named <span   class="emphasis"><em>firstname</em></span>.</p><p><a href="2557l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Second Version of Perl
Program hello.pl</a></p><p>When <b  >$firstname</b> is set to the value NOT
CHANGED, as in Listing 3, the value of the HTML form element
<span   class="emphasis"><em>firstname</em></span> is ignored when we call
create_variables, and we get a greeting to NOT CHANGED, rather than
the user's first name. If we comment out the line defining
<b  >$firstname</b> as NOT CHANGED, create_variables does
its job just fine, creating a variable named
<b  >$firstname</b> and giving it the value that the user
provided. This behavior is a good idea in terms of web security,
but the silent failure of one or more variable assignments strikes
me as a possible pitfall.</p><p>CGI.pm offers similar functionality with its
<span   class="bold"><b>import_names</b></span> method. In this case,
the authors encourage users to import names into a separate name
space, ensuring that there are no name conflicts with existing
variables.</p><p>Notice that in the Listing 3 version of hello.pl, I have
removed the <b  >use strict</b> line. This was to avoid
possible conflicts when commenting out the line that defines a
default value for <b  >$firstname</b>. The
<span   class="bold"><b>strict</b></span> module requires that you
define variables before using them; however, if we are referencing
variables that are created by create_variables, this is
impossible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1697580.0x1787b20"></a>GET and POST</h2></div></div><p>CGI_Lite.pm is smart enough to grab form elements passed by
either of the two methods: GET or POST. POST is generally
considered to be the better method of the two, since it passes the
contents of the form to a CGI program via standard input (stdin),
rather than as part of the URL. However, if we were interested in
passing a name to hello.pl as part of the URL, we could do so as
follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://localhost/cgi-bin/hello.pl?firstname=Reuven
</pre><p>Of course, if you are testing this program from a computer
other than the web server, you need to replace
<b  >localhost</b> with the name of a server. For
example, if your server runs on www.fictional.edu, you could use:
<pre     class="programlisting">
http://www.fictional.edu/cgi-bin/hello.pl?firstname=Reuven
</pre>


Notice how we can set the variable's value after the question mark,
known in CGI lingo as the &ldquo;query string&rdquo;. The query string is
part of the URL, and URLs may not contain white space or other
&ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; characters that might be misinterpreted by the
browser and/or the server. For these reasons, certain characters
must be sent in &ldquo;percent-hex&rdquo; format, in which the character's
ASCII value in hexadecimal is prefaced by a percent sign.
Obviously, the percent sign itself (ASCII value 0x25) must be
encoded in this way. Thus, if my &ldquo;first&rdquo; name were actually two
names, I could send the string as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
http://www.fictional.edu/cgi-bin/hello.pl?firstname=J%20Edgar
</pre>


Since the &ldquo;space&rdquo; character is ASCII 0x20 (32 in decimal), we can
insert a space into the URL by sending a <b  >%20</b>.
CGI_Lite.pm automatically translates the percent-hex encoding into
the ASCII codes we want.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1697580.0x1787e38"></a>Getting the Query String</h2></div></div><p>While GET can be used to send name,value pairs, it is often
used to send simple text strings. For example, it might be nice to
send a name without assigning any value, as in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://www.fictional.edu/cgi-bin/hello.pl?J%20Edgar
</pre><p>This technique is often useful when CGI programs have to
receive a user's unique ID in a relational database running on the
web server. If we send the identifier as part of the query string,
the program can grab that value and use it as the index into a
table in the database, producing a personalized home page or
otherwise unique output customized for the user.
</p><p>Several on-line booksellers use this method. When I go to
Amazon.com to check the status of my latest order, I go to a URL
that looks like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
https://www.mybookstore.com/cgi-bin/order.pl?1234-5678-9012
</pre><p>What I would like is a simple way of retrieving this string.
CGI.pm allows you to get the string by pretending that the contents
of the query string are assigned to the variable named keywords, so
if we are using CGI.pm, we can type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $id_number = $query-&gt;param("keywords");
</pre>


Now, the variable $id_number contains the value &ldquo;1234-5678-9012&rdquo;.
</p><p>If we are using CGI_Lite.pm, things get a bit more
complicated, because the module expects the query string to only be
used for sending name,value pairs, not individual text strings.
Thus, when we send the above query string, CGI_Lite.pm assumes that
what we are actually setting the form element named
&ldquo;1234-5678-9012&rdquo; to a null value&mdash;not quite what we might expect,
but something which we can manage.</p><p>One possible method is to load parse_form_data to turn the
received name,value pairs into a hash. The hash contains a single
key, corresponding to the data that was passed in the query string,
which CGI_Lite.pm thinks is a variable name. We can then retrieve
that key by getting the list of keys in our hash. Listing 4 is code
that accomplishes that feat.</p><p><a href="2557l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Using Hash
Keys</a></p><p>This is not the most efficient way to get the information,
but it does do the trick. We could simply read the information from
the QUERY_STRING environment variable&mdash;but that would introduce
another problem, namely, the translation of characters sent in
percent-hex encoding. By using the built-in facilities of
CGI_Lite.pm, we ensure that the translation is done
correctly.</p><p>If you find this somewhat confusing, you're not alone. Many
of my own programs take advantage of the query string, and having
to pretend that my data is really a variable name strikes me as a
bit odd. Perhaps a future version of CGI_Lite.pm will handle this,
although adding too many features would eventually turn it into
CGI_NoLongerLite.pm.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1697580.0x1788360"></a>Debugging</h2></div></div><p>Debugging CGI programs is often difficult because the
execution takes place behind the scenes. In contrast with more
typical programs, which allow us to interact with them while they
are running, CGI programs are invoked by Web servers, with input
coming from the user's Web browser (via the Web server, which hands
that data to the program), and with output returning to the user's
browser (again, via the Web server).</p><p>CGI.pm offers two good aids to debugging CGI programs. A
<span   class="bold"><b>dump</b></span> method that prints out the
contents of all HTML form variables as they are received, and a
command-line interface that allows programmers to enter variable
assignments without invoking the program from an HTML form.</p><p>In keeping with its light-weight philosophy, CGI_Lite.pm does
not offer the command-line debugging interface, which might make
debugging large programs difficult. However, it does offer a way to
check the data that was received from the user's web browser. The
<span   class="bold"><b>print_form_data</b></span> method sends all
of the known name-value pairs to stdout. If your program does not
work correctly and you want to check the values of the input data,
you can add the following line to your program:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$query-&gt;print_form_data;
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1697580.0x1788620"></a>Which Should You Use?</h2></div></div><p>With the above discussion in mind, which module should you
use when writing your CGI programs? In most cases, I would tend to
stick with CGI.pm, for a variety of reasons.</p><p>First of all, I tend to use CGI.pm's command-line debugging
interface quite a bit, and the fact that CGI_Lite.pm lacks such an
ability is a major hindrance for me. It is certainly possible to
get around this problem, since I wrote CGI programs for a while
before CGI.pm appeared on the scene, but it never hurts to have
another debugging tool in your arsenal, particularly when writing
large, complicated programs.</p><p>A second reason why I would tend to favor CGI.pm is because I
often have to work with other people on projects, and using two
different interfaces to the CGI standard might make life difficult
for them. (We have enough problems as is; we don't also need to try
to remember whether we should be using param or parse_form_data in
order to retrieve information.)</p><p>Third, I find it useful to have extra functions that take
care of the small parts of producing HTML. I used to constantly
forget to put two newline (<b  >\n</b>) characters at the
end of MIME headers; with CGI.pm, I no longer have to
remember.</p><p>At the same time, I find it somewhat irresponsible to write
small CGI programs that use over 1MB of RAM before they even begin
to perform any calculations or allocate any data structures. For
small projects in which I want to use Perl (rather than a compiled
language, such as C) but in which I want to maximize efficiency, I
use CGI_Lite.pm. I also like the use of hashes, which strikes me as
a natural way to store and retrieve form elements. Also, the fact
that CGI_Lite.pm does almost everything I wish, including such
advanced items as HTTP cookies and the uploading of files, makes it
rather attractive for small-scale projects.</p><p>In an era of software bloat and programs that try to do more
and more, it is refreshing to find a module that tries to do less
and does it well. CGI_Lite.pm is not appropriate in all cases, but
it is useful, well documented and efficient. If you are trying to
squeeze the last few ounces of memory and CPU time from your web
server, consider using CGI_Lite.pm in your next program&mdash;and enjoy
the extra RAM for other projects.</p></div></div>
