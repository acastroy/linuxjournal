    How do you keep unwanted visitors out of your network while
    still giving your users the Internet access they rely on?
    The answer is a firewall equipped with a proxy server.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f3580.0x23eb500"></a></h2></div></div><p>Proxy servers are software applications
that run on your firewall machine in order to provide indirect
Internet access to your network. The firewall can be either a
&ldquo;single-homed&rdquo; host or a &ldquo;dual-homed&rdquo; host. A single-homed host
is a machine with one network card. This configuration relies on
the Internet router to block all packets to any machine except the
firewall. A dual-homed host is a machine with two network cards
that has routing capabilities disabled. Computers behind the
firewall can talk to the dual-homed host, and computers on the
Internet can communicate with the dual-homed host. However, since
routing between the network cards is disabled, the computers behind
the firewall cannot talk directly to the computers on the Internet.
</p><p>The proxy server is used to allow Internet access from inside
the protected network through either the single or dual-homed host
firewall. The client applications speak directly to the proxy
server and the proxy server in turn speaks directly to the Internet
hosts on behalf of the client, thusacting as a proxy. This
interaction allows Internet access to all clients on the internal
network, but leaves only one machine, the firewall, directly
vulnerable to attacks from the Internet.</p><p>The proxy server takes a packet from inside your network that
is bound for the Internet and changes the &ldquo;from&rdquo; address to its
own address. It then forwards the packet to the destination host.
The beauty of the proxy server is that the destination host thinks
it is talking only to the firewall. When the firewall receives the
response from the destination host, the proxy server sends the
packet back to the original requesting machine. The client has the
illusion that it has been communicating directly with the host on
the Internet. The host on the Internet has the illusion that it is
only dealing with the firewall.</p><p>This method is a big advantage when you access FTP sites that
do double-reverse lookups. These sites, as a security measure, want
to ensure you are truly coming from the address you've given. The
host name of the requesting IP address is looked up in the DNS
records. The server then does a lookup of the host name it
received. If the IP address it receives from this last lookup does
not match the requesting one or if the DNS lookup failed to find
any entries, the server denies access.</p><p>If you are denied access to one of these sites, there is most
likely a problem with your DNS setup. When you have to manage
several machines across your network, keeping all the entries up to
date can be a daunting task. With a proxy server in place, your
entire network appears to come from the IP address of the proxy
server, thus reducing the total number of properly configured DNS
entries you need.</p><p>Another advantage of using a proxy server is that since all
outbound traffic must pass through the firewall, as an
administrator, you can monitor which types of Internet activity are
occurring. The proxy server has very robust logging capabilities
which allow you to see who is accessing what on the Internet.
Attempted access from the outside is also logged closely.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f3580.0x23eb7c0"></a>Setting up the Linux box</h2></div></div><p>I will not go into the details of setting up a
packet-filtering router, since that type of information is vendor
specific. However, I will give you the basic information on setting
up a dual-homed host firewall. Assuming you use a Linux machine for
your host, you will need to have two network cards installed in
your machine. Read the &ldquo;Multiple-Ethernet&rdquo; mini-HOWTO located at
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/. I used two 3Com509 cards.</p><p>Auto-sensing the modules to load is a common problem when
using two identical cards, so I compiled the drivers into a
monolithic kernel instead of a modular one. I also added the
following line to my /etc/lilo.conf file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
append="ether=11,0x300,eth0 ether=10,0x270,eth1"
</pre><p>This ensures that the proper parameters are passed at boot
time.
</p><p>Configure your kernel to keep it from routing IP packets (see
Listing 1). To further ensure protection and anonymity, use one of
the &ldquo;bogus&rdquo; class addresses (see Table 1) as per RFC1918. These
IP addresses are set aside by the INTERNIC for use behind a
firewall. Any packet with one of these IP addresses is dropped by
the Internet backbone routers. See Figure 1 for an example of a
network topology with a dual-homed host firewall. The example
configuration files in this article are based on this basic
topology. Our protected network is assigned the &ldquo;bogus&rdquo; Class C
address 192.168.50, and we assume that the valid IP address of the
Internet side of the firewall is 111.222.333.1.</p><p><a href="2408l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p><a href="2408t1.html" target="_self">Table 1</a></p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2408f1.large.jpg"><img src="2408f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

http://www.socks.nec.com/. There are several advantages to using
the Socks5 server. Many TCP/IP applications have support for Socks5
proxies built in. There is an INTERNIC RFC for it (RFC1928). It
proxies all services through one port, allowing you to block
incoming packets on most other ports. Finally, it has support for
the most commonly used services that your users will want: HTTP,
FTP, TELNET, finger, archie, whois, ping and traceroute. Unix
clients are included and compiled with the source distribution. A
client application for Win 3.11, Win95 and WinNT is also available
for download. If you have custom applications, you can use the
Socks5 library to compile Socks5 support into your
application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f3580.0x23ebe48"></a>Compiling</h2></div></div><p>I was able to compile the source distribution for Socks5
correctly the first time. A configure script is used to set up all
the necessary flags, parameters and Makefiles for your system.
Afterward, it's as simple as executing <b  >make</b> and
then <b  >make install</b> to put all the binaries and
man pages into the /usr/local/ directory tree. The following are
the steps required to build and install the Socks5 software:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xvzf socks5-beta-0.17.2-exportable.tar.gz
cd socks5-beta-0.17.2-exportable
./configure
make
su
make install
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f3580.0x23ec058"></a>Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The server can be started via
<span   class="bold"><b>inetd</b></span> or run as a daemon. Running
as a daemon has the advantage of increased performance to the user.
Running via inetd leaves the firewall less burdened when not in
use. If your site is like mine, there is never a time when the
Internet is not being accessed. I configured the Socks5 server to
run as a daemon and added the command to start the server to my
/etc/rc.d/rc.local file.</p><p>Configuration of the firewall is done in two steps. First,
there is a configuration file on the server that must be set up
specifically for your site. The default file is /etc/socks5.conf
(see Listing 2). The man page gives information on the appropriate
syntax, and there are also example configurations at
http://www.socks.nec.com/v5examples.html. Second, there are
configurations that must be done on each of your client
workstations. On Unix clients, this is the /etc/libsocks5.conf file
(see Listing 3).</p><p><a href="2408l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p><a href="2408l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>On your Win-based machines, several different things need to
be done. If all of your users limit their Internet usage to the
Web, you can keep your configuration limited to the options
available in both Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet
Explorer. For Netscape Navigator, the appropriate settings are
located in &ldquo;Options&rdquo;<b  >-&gt;</b> &ldquo;Network
Settings&rdquo;<b  >-&gt;</b>&ldquo;Proxies&rdquo;. Select &ldquo;Manual
configuration&rdquo; and then enter the Socks5 server IP address with
port 1080 (note: this is the default port, and can be configured
differently at compile time). For Netscape Navigator 4.0, the
settings are found under
&ldquo;Edit&rdquo;<b  >-&gt;</b>&ldquo;Preferences&rdquo;<b  >-&gt;</b>&ldquo;Advanced&rdquo;<b  >-&gt;</b>
&ldquo;Proxies&rdquo;. The remainder of the configuration is the same as
above. For MS Internet Explorer, select
&ldquo;View&rdquo;<b  >-&gt;</b>&ldquo;Options&rdquo;<b  >-&gt;</b>&ldquo;Connection&rdquo;.
Select &ldquo;Connect through a proxy server&rdquo;. Enter the IP address of
your Socks5 server as well as the port 1080.</p><p>If your user's demands go beyond simple Web access, the
download site for the Socks5 software also contains two versions of
SocksCap, the Windows redirector: SocksCap16 and SocksCap32. The
SocksCap16 software is used for Windows 3.11 clients while
SocksCap32 is used on both Win95 and WinNT. The SocksCap16
application only needs to be running at the same time as the
Winsock application in order to proxy the application. The
SocksCap32 application, however, must be started first, and the
Winsock application launched from within SocksCap32. Alternately,
you can create a shortcut to the desktop or the &ldquo;Start&rdquo; menu that
calls the Winsock application profile from the command line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
C:\Program Files\SocksCap\sc32.exe ws_ftp
</pre><p>Both versions of SocksCap require you to enter the
appropriate IP address and port to your server when you start the
application for the first time.

is another widely-used, freely-available, proxy-server solution.
The TIS firewall toolkit provides very specific proxies for each
service, giving you the ability to set up just an HTTP proxy
server, for example, if you wish to limit your users to just that
service. When the package builds, the proxies that are built
include an HTTP (http-gw), FTP (ftp-gw), TELNET (tn-gw), rlogin
(rlogin-gw), X (x-gw) and generic proxy (plug-gw). Also included is
a secure replacement for sendmail (smap) as well as an
authentication module (authsrv). The generic proxy gives you the
ability to configure proxies for specific machines and ports.
Possible uses for this proxy could be proxying Usenet news as well
as accessing e-mail through the POP3 protocol. (Socks5 does not
include support for either News or POP3.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f3580.0x23ec840"></a>Compiling</h2></div></div><p>The TIS fwtk builds fairly easily. I had to apply the http-gw
patch in order to get the HTTP proxy to build. If you are building
this toolkit on a system other than Linux, make sure you use
<b  >gmake</b> instead of <b  >make</b>. I ran
into this problem when I tried to build this package on an SGI.
Doing this may require you to first acquire and build GNU
<b  >make</b>, which is available at
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/.</p><p>There is no configure script available with the TIS fwtk.
Instead, there are several versions of the Makefile.config. Simply
apply the http-gw patch, move Makefile.config.linux to
Makefile.config, run <b  >make</b> and then run
<b  >make install</b>. Note that in order to build the
x-gw X proxy, you need the Motif libraries. The easiest way to get
them is to download <span   class="bold"><b>lesstif</b></span>, a
Motif clone available at http://www.hungry.com/products/. The
following are the steps required to build and install the fwtk
software:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvzf fwtk-2.0.tar.gz
cd fwtk
chmod -R 755 *
tar xvf ../http-gw.patch.tar
mv Makefile.config Makefile.config.orig
ln -s Makefile.config.linux Makefile.config
makea
su
make install
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f3580.0x23ecc08"></a>TIS fwtk Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The binaries are placed in the /usr/local/etc directory, a
location not likely to be affected by system upgrades. The proxies
can be configured to run as daemons or by inetd. Take careful note
of the man pages. There are specific command-line arguments that
must be invoked in order to get the proxy to run as a daemon. As I
mentioned above, you can configure as many or as few of the proxies
provided. The configuration is much more complicated than for the
Socks5 server. The configuration file is called
/usr/local/etc/netparam and is parsed based on the proxies. Each
line starts with the name of the proxy followed by a colon and then
by the options (see Listing 4).</p><p><a href="2408l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>The client configuration is different from the Socks5
configuration. For the two browsers mentioned above, simply leave
the Socks5 entry blank and fill in the HTTP proxy and port, as well
as FTP and TELNET entries, if you have set these services up on the
firewall. Good news for those using a browser other than Navigator
and Explorer&mdash;you can use the TIS fwtk http-gw proxy with any
browser. Simply prefix all web addresses with
http://<span   class="emphasis"><em>IP-or-name-of-firewall-host</em></span>/. For FTP,
you first FTP to the proxy-server host. When prompted for the user
name, enter anonymous@ftp.ftpsite.com; the proxy then goes out and
makes the appropriate connection. For News, you must configure the
plug-gw as illustrated in the configuration file (see Listing 4).
Accessing news is as simple as configuring your news client to
point to the proxy server instead of the real news server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f3580.0x27e50c0"></a>Integrating both packages</h2></div></div><p>When I first set out to construct a firewall/proxy server
solution where I work, I initially chose the Socks5 server. (I had
downloaded them both, but the Socks5 server compiled without
errors, thus sealing my choice.) Within a day, I had figured out
which settings I needed for my network and had the server running
as a daemon.</p><p>Getting users excited about using the proxy server as opposed
to direct Internet access is not easy. Recently, a user approached
me ranting about how he could not stream video in from the
Internet. After he calmed down, I asked him which URL he was trying
to access. Then I quickly found a FAQ for the particular plug-in he
was using with an entry similar to &ldquo;How do I stream video through
a firewall.&rdquo; After reading the FAQ and looking at the available
options, I found that this particular plug-in did not have Socks5
support. It did, however, have support for general HTTP proxying.
So, I turned my attention back to the TIS fwtk I had abandoned 10
months before. I found a newer version, applied the http-gw patch,
executed <span   class="bold"><b>gmake</b></span> and had the toolkit
running later that day. The video streaming worked
beautifully.</p><p>This story illustrates the fact that you do not have to make
an either/or decision about Socks5 or the TIS firewall toolkit. The
two packages can be used together to give your users a wide variety
of Internet access.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f3580.0x27e52d0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Setting up a proxy server is a great way to give your users
Internet access while still protecting your network from Internet
attacks. Between both the Socks5 server and the TIS firewall
toolkit, you can give your users as much or as little Internet
access as you want.</p><p><a href="2408s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
