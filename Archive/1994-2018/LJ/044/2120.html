    This article describes an implementation of a
    user-authentication API: the
    Pluggable-Authentication-Modules API (PAM for short).
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af3580.0x1beb558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Have you ever wondered how much work it
would be to modify login to work the way you want it to? Perhaps
you want it to refer to shadowed passwords or you don't want to let
users log in during certain times of the day. Perhaps your policy
is to ensure that root cannot log in anywhere other than at the
console; maybe, root should never log in when the system is
connected to the network. You might implement MD5-secured
passwords, or passwords secured with RIPEMD-160 or SHA? Perhaps you
have decided passwords are insufficiently secure for your needs,
and instead you would like a user to insert their identity card in
a slot to log in. Further, you would like to integrate your system
into a network security environment like Kerberos; the primary
login of a user would need to activate their identity with respect
to the Kerberos server. The variations and combinations are
endless. There is no perfect solution. There never will be.
</p><p>Given sufficient incentive to implement a new
user-authentication scheme, the traditional solution has been to
amend, or rewrite, all of the system-access applications (login,
su, passwd, ftp, xdm, ... )--this takes time and resources. An
annoying by-product of such an upgrade is that modifying one
application requires you to simultaneously upgrade other
applications to maintain a consistent entry policy for your system.
Unless you write the applications yourself, it is not easy to
simply insert the code and be sure you have filled all the
holes.</p><p>The revision of a system's security policy also suffers from
the following potential weakness: people who write appealing user
interfaces are not always paranoid enough to write
<span   class="emphasis"><em>secure</em></span> software. This point relates to both
access-oriented (login, etc.) and information-security (e-mail
encryption, etc.) software.</p><p>Current thinking on computer-related security is to separate
the security policy from the service offered by an application.
This allows the author of a security-dependant application to use
an application programming interface (API) to take care of the
security-related issues and concentrate their efforts on writing a
good (robust but user friendly) application.</p><p>An API is typically defined by a document describing a set of
functions that an application programmer can
<span   class="emphasis"><em>rely</em></span> on. For example,
<span   class="bold"><b>libc</b></span> is an implementation of a
number of APIs. Collaborative organizations, such as ANSI, POSIX or
X/Open, produce a document defining the API and then
<span   class="emphasis"><em>vendors</em></span> (or enthusiasts in the case of Linux)
implement it. Security-related APIs exist for tasks like user
authentication and data encryption.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af3580.0x1beb920"></a>What is PAM?</h2></div></div><p>Prompted by a comment on the linux-security e-mail list, Ted
Ts'o asked the following question: &ldquo;Has anyone thought of
implementing PAM?&rdquo;, and thus, he launched the Linux-PAM project.
Marc Ewing (of Red Hat Software) quickly coded a framework for most
of the library in January 1996. Since then I have been maintaining
the Linux-PAM distribution. Thanks to the combined efforts of a
number of people (I've included a &ldquo;mostly&rdquo; complete list at the
end of this article), I'm proud to say Linux-PAM is now a reality.
Better still, people are using it.</p><p>The document defining PAM is a request-for-comments paper
(RFC) that was written by Vipin Samar and Roland J. Schemers III of
SunSoft, Inc. Specifically, it is OSF-RFC 86.0, October 1995,
&ldquo;Unified Login with Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)&rdquo;. The
Linux-PAM URL at the end of this article contains a pointer to this
document.</p><p>The PAM-API breaks the business of authentication into four
independent management groups. These four groups are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Authentication/credential acquisition</p></li><li><p>Account management</p></li><li><p>Session management</p></li><li><p>Authentication token (password) updating</p></li></ol></div><p>Typically, a login application would need to use each of
these groups when granting a candidate user access to a system.
Applications like <span   class="bold"><b>passwd</b></span> only
require access to the last of these groups.
</p><p>The novelty and power of the PAM-API resides in the leading
&ldquo;P&rdquo; for pluggability. It may surprise the reader to note that
this is the part of PAM that is irrelevant from the point of the
login- application writer. Instead, it introduces a role for the
system administrator in the process of choosing an authentication
scheme for login.</p><p>Veteran Linux users will remember all the hype that
surrounded the move to ELF from the older a.out system binary. A
desirable feature of this transition was the introduction of a
library function, <span   class="bold"><b>dlopen(3)</b></span>. This
function call provides a reliable method for a running program to
dynamically load some code for the purpose of execution. Its
sibling function, <span   class="bold"><b>dlclose(3)</b></span>, is
used to unload, or discard, such code when it is no longer
required. Implementations of PAM utilize these functions to
dynamically bind an application program to locally specified
authentication modules. That is, the pluggability of PAM is dynamic
and thus at the discretion of the local system
administrator.</p><p>With a PAM-based login application, the system administrator
can completely change the authentication scheme the application
uses <span   class="bold"><b>without</b></span> modifying or
recompiling it. In principle, this can even be done without
rebooting the computer. However, before a new authentication scheme
is fully deployed, the best approach is to isolate a computer from
any network and test it under controlled conditions to ensure the
new arrangement is robust.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af3580.0x1bec0b0"></a>Some details</h2></div></div><p>In the remainder of this article, I will give a brief
overview of how to write and use a PAM-based application. Potential
authors and interested administrators should see the Linux-PAM URL
(at the end) for more complete details. The intention of this
article is to provide only a taste of what you can do with
Linux-PAM. In particular, I will not address the issue of how to
write an authentication module. For those details you should
consult the full documentation available from the Linux-PAM
URL.</p><p>Let us consider a generic login-type application. We will see
which responsibilities are delegated to the PAM-API and which
responsibilities are retained by the application. Finally, we will
cover how a local administrator can configure the application to
suit local taste.</p><p><a href="2120f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a> is a graphic
protraying the three components to a working PAM-based application.
On the left is the application which is linked to the libpam.so
shared library. In the middle we have the PAM library which parses
the configuration file(s) and uses the entries listed there to load
the configured selection of authentication modules
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>PAMs</em></span>). Additionally, the application supplies
a <span   class="emphasis"><em>conversation function</em></span> which provides a means
for the modules to talk directly with the user.</p><p>In <a href="2120l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> the skeleton of
a login-type application is shown. It can be compared with the
sample application given in the OSF-RFC defining PAM. The
differences reflect enhancements to PAM since the RFC was written.
Note, the listing is not very secure; it pays little attention to
possible errors returned by the framework and is intended only to
orient the reader.</p><p>The application initializes the library with a call to
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_start()</b></span>, which silently parses
the configuration file and loads those authentication modules that
are appropriate to this application. It then enters a loop that
attempts to authenticate applicant users. This process is repeated
until a user is correctly authenticated, or the loaded
authentication modules indicate that their patience has been
exhausted.</p><p>Once a user has been authenticated, the
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_acct_mgmt()</b></span> function is used
to establish if the user is permitted to log in at this time.
Modules of account-management type can be used to restrict users
from logging in at certain times of the day/week or for enforcing
password expiration. This latter case is intercepted, and the user
is prevented from gaining access to the system until they have
successfully updated their password with the
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_chauthtok()</b></span> function.</p><p>The user's login session is surrounded with two sets of
function calls. The outer function calls,
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_open_session()</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_close_session()</b></span>, mark the
beginning and end of the PAM-authenticated session. Session
initialization and termination typically include tasks such as
making a system resource available (mounting the user's home
directory) and establishing an audit trail. The inner function
calls, <span   class="bold"><b>pam_setcred()</b></span>, first
establish and finally release the PAM-configurable identity of the
user. These can include credentials like access-tickets and
supplementary group memberships.</p><p>Following logout, the user's PAM-configurable credentials are
deleted, and the session is closed with a call to the
pam_close_session() function.</p><p>Finally, with a call to
<span   class="bold"><b>pam_end()</b></span>, the login application
breaks its connection to the PAM library. The PAMs are unloaded,
and the dynamically allocated memory is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>scrubbed</em></span> and returned to the system.</p><p>This simple application demonstrates most of the
functionality provided by the PAM paradigm. The conversation
mechanism flexibly leaves the mode of direct interaction with the
user entirely at the discretion of the application. In this way, it
is possible for modules to be used simultaneously with
graphically-based programs (<span   class="bold"><b>xdm</b></span>
etc.) and their text based equivalents
(<span   class="bold"><b>login</b></span> etc.).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af3580.0x1bec9a0"></a>Configuring an Application</h2></div></div><p>Having obtained a PAM-based application, it is necessary to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>attach</em></span> authentication modules to it. At the
time of this writing there is an old way and a new way of doing
this. The old way corresponds to the method advocated in the RFC
and is based on a the contents of a single PAM configuration file:
/etc/pam.conf. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> method is to break up
the entries for the separate services into independent
configuration files that are each located in the /etc/pam.d/
directory. The name of the file containing the configuration for a
given application is the service name (in lower-case
letters).</p><p>The function of the configuration file(s) is to provide a
mapping from the application's service name to a selection of
modules that provide authentication services to the raw
application. In the case of the source program of Listing 1, the
service name is simply &ldquo;login&rdquo;. (This is the first argument of
the pam_start() function call.)</p><p>Along with similar entries for each of the PAM-aware services
present on your system, the old configuration file (/etc/pam.conf)
might contain entries of the following form:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
...
# Here is the module configuration for login as it
# might appear in "/etc/pam.conf"
#
login   auth    requisite       pam_securetty.so
login   auth    required        pam_unix_auth.so
login   account required        pam_unix_acct.so
login   session optional        pam_cfs.so      \
        keys=/etc/security/cfs.keys
login   session required        pam_unix_sess.so
login   password        sufficient      pam_unix_passwd.so
login   password        required        pam_warn.so
#
...
</pre><p>The first four fields are: <span   class="emphasis"><em>service-name</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>module-type</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>control-flag</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>module-filename</em></span>. The fifth and greater
fields are for optional arguments that are specific to the
individual authentication modules.
</p><p>The second field in the configuration file is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>module-type</em></span>, it indicates which of the four
PAM management services the corresponding module will provide to
the application. Our sample configuration file refers to all four
groups:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >auth</b>: identifies the PAMs that
are invoked when the application calls pam_authenticate() and
pam_setcred().</p></li><li><p><b  >account</b>: maps to the
pam_acct_mgmt() function.</p></li><li><p><b  >session</b>: indicates the mapping
for the pam_open_session() and pam_close_session() calls.</p></li><li><p><b  >password</b>: group refers to the
pam_chauthtok() function.</p></li></ul></div><p>Generally, you only need to supply mappings for the functions
that are needed by a specific application. For example, the
standard password changing application, passwd, only requires a
<b  >password</b> group entry; any other entries are
ignored.
</p><p>The third field indicates what action is to be taken based on
the success or failure of the corresponding module. Choices for
tokens to fill this field are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >requisite</b>: Failure instantly
returns control to the application indicating the nature of the
first module failure.</p></li><li><p><b  >required</b>: All these modules are
required to succeed for <span   class="bold"><b>libpam</b></span> to
return success to the application.</p></li><li><p><b  >sufficient</b>: Given that all
preceding modules have succeeded, the success of this module leads
to an immediate and successful return to the application (failure
of this module is ignored).</p></li><li><p><b  >optional</b>: The success or failure
of this module is generally not recorded.</p></li></ul></div><p>The fourth field contains the name of the loadable module,
pam_*.so. For the sake of readability, the full pathname of each
module is not given. Before Linux-PAM-0.56 was released, there was
no support for a default authentication-module directory. If you
have an earlier version of Linux-PAM installed, you will have to
specify the full path for each of the modules. Your distribution
most likely placed these modules exclusively in one of the
following directories: /lib/security/ or /usr/lib/security/.</p><p>The equivalent functionality for our login application can be
obtained with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> configuration
arrangement via an independent login configuration file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#%PAM-1.0
#(The above "magic" header is optional)
# The modules for login as they might appear in
# "/etc/pam.d/login" this configuration is
# accepted by Linux-PAM-0.56 and higher.
#
auth    requisite       pam_securetty.so
auth    required        pam_unix_auth.so
account required        pam_unix_acct.so
session optional        pam_cfs.so      \
        keys=/etc/security/cfs.keys
session required        pam_unix_sess.so
password        sufficient      pam_unix_passwd.so
password        required        pam_warn.so
# end of file.
</pre><p>The newer configuration file is distinct from the old in that
it is missing a <span   class="emphasis"><em>service-name</em></span> field. This field
is not needed, as the name of the service-specific configuration
file is by definition the <span   class="emphasis"><em>service-name</em></span> of the
application.</p><p>It should be noted that the content of an /etc/pam.d/
directory takes precedence over the contents of any /etc/pam.conf
file.</p><p>Note that the example contains more than a single module
mapping for the <b  >auth</b>, <b  >session</b>
and <b  >password</b> management groups. This feature is
referred to as <span   class="emphasis"><em>stacking</em></span> and enables a single
application to make use of more than one module at a time. The
order in which the modules are stacked is the same as the order in
which they are invoked.</p><p>The two stacked <b  >auth</b> modules are used to
pam_authenticate() the user. The first module (pam_securetty.so)
checks to see if the user is root and prevents root from logging in
from an insecure terminal. The value <b  >requisite</b>
for <span   class="emphasis"><em>control-flag</em></span> is used to force immediate
authentication failure if the <b  >securetty</b> module
fails. If this occurs, no more of the <b  >auth</b>
modules are executed. This has the benefit of preventing root from
mistakenly typing a password over an insecure terminal line.
Another popular module that can be used to prevent log in attempts
like this is pam_listfile.so. It can be configured to perform many
types of access control based on a list of tokens in a specified
file.</p><p>When a non-superuser, <b  >joe</b> for example, is
successfully evaluated by the <b  >securetty</b> module,
control is passed to the next module in the stack,
pam_unix_auth.so. This module performs standard Unix
authentication. It prompts for a password and checks it against
that stored in the local system. Providing your libc can handle it,
it works on both shadowed and non-shadowed systems. An enhanced
alternative to pam_unix_...so is the pam_pwdb.so module. This
module makes use of the password database library, libpwdb.so, and
can do things like MD5 passwords and offer RADIUS support. The
important point is that the system administrator is the one
deciding which authentication policy to implement by simply
<span   class="emphasis"><em>plugging in</em></span> the corresponding module.</p><p>The <b  >auth</b> module also supplies a binding
for the pam_setcred() function. It is linked to the authentication
process because the method by which a user is authenticated is
strongly tied to the user's identity. Kerberos, for example,
requires a network-based authentication and yields a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ticket</em></span> (the user's credential) with which they
can obtain network services, such as remote login and print
requests.</p><p>The <b  >account</b> module line in our
configuration file is used to check that the user is permitted to
login. This is different from establishing whether the user is who
they say they are. Account management deals with enforcing the
expiration of passwords and preventing logins during system time.
Our login example uses the standard pam_unix_acct.so module to
enforce shadow password aging. Here, it is used (in conjunction
with the <b  >password</b> module type) to force the
renewal of a user's password.</p><p>For experiments in this area, the administrator might like to
try pam_time.so. This module can be configured to permit or deny
access to users based on their terminal line, the time they are
logging in and what they intend to do.</p><p>Next, we come to the session modules. The first in the stack,
pam_cfs.so does not currently exist. (Because of ITAR export
restrictions, I will not be writing it.) However, I have included
it to illustrate the PAM session concept. At the start (and end) of
the user's session on the system, this module would mount/unmount
the user's cryptographically-secured home-directory, obtaining the
user's home-directory/key-mapping information from the cfs.keys
file. With PAM, someone could make a single module available, and
that module could be used in any PAM aware application. The use of
the value <b  >optional</b> for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>control-flag</em></span> ensures that the user can log in
even when no such directory is available.</p><p>The second module, pam_unix_sess.so, logs a message with
syslog(3) to announce the user's entry to and exit from the
system.</p><p>Finally, we come to the <b  >password</b>
management group. Here, the stacked modules are invoked when users
change their <span   class="emphasis"><em>authentication token(s)</em></span>.
Traditionally, this change could be for updating their password,
but it has the potential to be extended to refreshing a smart card
or a yearly update of an employee's retinal scan. In the case of
the login example, we simply request a replacement for the user's
Unix password. Because the pam_unix_passwd.so module is marked as
<b  >sufficient</b>, a warning is logged by the
pam_warn.so module only in the case that the user fails to
successfully enter a new password.</p><p>In addition to configuring specific service names, there is
also a default mapping, given the service name
<b  >other</b>. It can be used to ease the integration of
new services by providing a default selection of modules
appropriate to the local security policy. Instead, it can be used
to deny access to any application that does not have a specific
pam.conf entry. This is the recommended usage, for example, we can
make use of the pam_deny.so (always deny access) and pam_warn
(syslog(3) an informative warning) modules as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#%PAM-1.0
#(The above "magic" header is optional)
# The modules for defaulting services as defined
# in "/etc/pam.d/other" this configuration is
# accepted by Linux-PAM-0.56 and higher.
#
auth    required        pam_deny.so
auth    required        pam_warn.so
account required        pam_deny.so
session required        pam_deny.so
password        required        pam_warn.so
password        required        pam_deny.so
# end of file.
</pre><p>This configuration always denies user access to an
application. As before, the pam_warn.so is used to send a warning
message to syslog(3) for administrative action. This configuration
can be used to make sure that only specific services are available
on your system. Note, if you write an application that uses PAM and
this configuration file is not sufficient to block service from it,
your application is not using PAM in the correct manner.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af3580.0x1be5018"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>Thanks to the people at Red Hat, many applications are
available that have been modified to support the PAM approach to
user authentication. In this area, however, more work needs to be
done. Indeed, some important applications are still without
support. Most notably, the application
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> should be ported. Work is
currently underway to provide a flexible X-based conversation
function, and it is my feeling that this will lead immediately to a
number of more friendly uses for PAM integration, such as popular
games.</p><p>Most of the current Linux-PAM development is focused on the
production of more powerful and varied modules. At last count more
than twenty were written and the number is increasing&mdash;reflecting
the variety of authentication schemes people use within the Linux
community. You can be sure that with access to the corresponding
hardware, someone out there will write an authentication module for
a retinal scanner.</p><p>Recent work on the central PAM library, libpam.so, is
directed at testing the security of our implementation. Due to a
simple design that is well documented in the OSF-RFC and a friendly
dialogue with those maintaining the Sun implementation, this is not
proving to be an arduous task. In the six months it has been
available, only one or two significant security problems have come
to light. Currently, Linux-PAM is in beta-test (although the folks
at Red Hat are doing an admirable job of offering production-level
support for it). In particular, libpam.so.1.00 may even be
available by the time you read this article.</p><p>Before getting to version 1.00, libpam will also have support
for pluggable <span   class="emphasis"><em>password-mapping</em></span>, a method for
chaining a number of different passwords together in a secure
fashion. This concept (in a non-pluggable form) is discussed in the
RFC, however, the X/Open group have since revised it, and we will
implement their eventual specification in the coming months.</p><p>Further ahead, after releasing version 1.0, we will be
modifying the syntax of the PAM configuration file. Current ideas
relate to enhancing the <span   class="emphasis"><em>control-flag</em></span> field to
be a great deal more flexible. Other changes are likely to be
suggested and adopted as the number of administrators using PAM
increases.</p><p>Finally, is Linux-PAM the only implementation of PAM? Is
Linux alone? The answers to these questions are yes and no. At the
time of this writing, the Linux implementation of PAM is the only
fully functional version of PAM publicly available. This has been
the case for at least half a year. However, a partial
implementation of PAM is internally present (no /etc/pam.conf file)
in Sun's Solaris 2.5. Rumors indicate that Solaris 2.6 will contain
a complete, configurable implementation which should be available
this year. The Sun implementation for PAM has been contributed to
the X/Open group so look for it in other Unix variants in the
coming years. If being cross-platform compliant is important to
you, you should consult your vendor for more information.
Alternatively, all of the source for Linux-PAM is freely available,
so if your need is urgent, just read Linux as a synonym for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> and try Linux-PAM on your other platforms
now.</p><p><a href="2120s1.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p><p><a href="2120s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="2120s3.html" target="_self">Update</a></p></div></div>
