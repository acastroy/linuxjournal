relational database management system from Oracle Corporation. It
includes a set of administration tools, and precompilers for most
programming languages. This article will cover how to install and
configure an Oracle database on Linux.
</p><p>The installation file for Oracle 8.0.5 Enterprise Edition is
named Oracle8051EE_Intel.tgz. It can be downloaded from
<a href="ftp://technet.oracle.com" target="_self">ftp://technet.oracle.com/</a>.
If needed, the glibc patch file glibcpatch.tgz can be downloaded
from
<a href="ftp://ftp.oracle.com/pub/www/otn/linux" target="_self">ftp://ftp.oracle.com/pub/www/otn/linux/</a>.</p><p>Oracle currently uses glibc 2.0 rather than glibc 2.1. Oracle
has supplied a patch which, when combined with compatibility RPM
packages, allows it to run on Red Hat 6.0. I chose to use the
Linux-Mandrake 6.0 distribution for this installation. If you are
not using 6.0, you can skip the steps for installing the
compatibility RPMs and the glibc patch. It is possible to install
Oracle on other distributions, but since Oracle uses Red Hat for
its development, Red Hat (or some variation of Red Hat) is
preferred.</p><p>The C Development package must be installed when you install
Linux. If you want to install Oracle's Intelligent agent, you must
have tcl-8.0.3-20.i386.rpm installed. To install the JDBC drivers,
you must define a path to your classesxxx.zip file.</p><p>I recommend creating a minimum of three partitions for
Oracle. This allows you to use Oracle's Optimum Flexible
Architecture (OFA) standard. Using OFA gives you the capability to
segregate data from indexes and have multiple control files. The
partitions should be named u01, u02 and u03. You can create more
partitions if you have the disks to support them. I have two disks
on my machine, so I created a partition of 1GB for /u01 and 150MB
for /u02. I then created a directory called /u03 to give me the
equivalent of another mount point. The first partition (/u01) is
where the Oracle executables and all associated files will be
placed during the installation process. The remaining mount points
will be used for data files, indexes and control files.</p><p>A multitude of directories are created during the
installation process. Some of the more important ones are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>$ORACLE_HOME/bin contains the executables for the
database and administrative software.</p></li><li><p>$ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin contains the SQL scripts
used to create the catalog, and other useful scripts too numerous
to cover here. Refer to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oracle Database
Administration Manual</em></span> for an explanation of the scripts
contained in this directory.</p></li><li><p>$ORACLE_BASE/admin/SID/bdump contains the alert log
for the instance. The name of the alert log is alert_SID.log, where
SID is the system identifier for the instance (i.e., alert_greg.log
for this installation). This file is extremely important in
determining where problems lie. Any time you have an error or
database crash, this is the first place to look for information on
what might have happened to cause the problem.</p></li><li><p>$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin contains the
tnsnames.ora and listener.ora files. Both of these files are
described in the section on modifying configuration files.</p></li><li><p>$ORACLE_HOME/precomp/demo/proc contains several
Pro*C example programs.</p></li></ul></div><p>The data files, indexes and control files will be placed in
/oradata/SID, where SID is the system identifier for the instance
(i.e., /u01/oradata/greg, /u02/oradata/greg and /u03/oradata/greg
for this installation).
</p><p>The installation is broken down into 8 steps:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Pre-installation sets up the groups and users, and
performs all the tasks prior to actually installing the
software.</p></li><li><p>Software installation is the process of installing
the software.</p></li><li><p>Documentation installation is the process of
installing the on-line documentation for Oracle. This must be done
in a separate step due to a bug in the installation process.</p></li><li><p>Binary patching is the process of applying the
glibc patch supplied by Oracle.</p></li><li><p>Database creation creates the initial
database.</p></li><li><p>Post-installation is the process of running a
post-install script as root.</p></li><li><p>Configuration file modification is the process of
identifying and modifying the configuration files used by the
database and Net8.</p></li><li><p>Testing and automation is the final process of
determining that the database is installed and configured properly,
and setting the instance up to start automatically when the machine
is rebooted.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173e580.0x18372c0"></a>Pre-installation Steps</h2></div></div><p>Download the compatibility RPMs from Red Hat. The necessary
RPMs are compat-binutils-5_2-2_9_1_0_23_1_i386.rpm,
compat-glibc-5_2-2_0_7_1_i386.rpm,
compat-egcs-5_2-1_0_3a_1_i386.rpm,
compat-egcs-c++-5_2-1_0_3a_1_i386.rpm and
compat-libs-5_2-1_i386.rpm. Issue the following commands to install
the RPMs:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ivh compat-binutils-5_2-2_9_1_0_23_1_i386.rpm
rpm -ivh compat-glibc-5_2-2_0_7_1_i386.rpm
rpm -ivh compat-egcs-5_2-1_0_3a_1_i386.rpm
rpm -ivh compat-egcs-c++-5_2-1_0_3a_1_i386.rpm
rpm -ivh compat-libs-5_2-1_i386.rpm
</pre><p>Edit /etc/passwd for root and change the shell from /bin/bash
to /bin/sh. This will make the installation scripts supplied by
Oracle run without errors.
</p><p>Create the groups and users used by Oracle. At a minimum, you
will need a group called <b  >dba</b> for the oracle
user. You may also want to create a group called
<b  >oper</b> for the operation of the database. Refer to
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Database Administrator's Guide for Oracle</em></span>
to determine whether you want to create this group. In the
following example, I used only the <b  >dba</b> group,
with a group ID of 601. You may need to use a different group ID if
601 is already in use on your system. Be sure to change the
password for the <b  >oracle</b> user.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
groupadd -g 601 dba
useradd oracle -g 601
passwd oracle
</pre><p>Edit /etc/passwd as root to change the default shell.
</p><p>Create the directories for your mount points if you didn't
create them as partitions. Repeat the commands for all three mount
points if necessary.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /u01
chown -R oracle.dba /u01
</pre><p>Change to the directory where you have unpacked the
Oracle8051EE_Intel.tgz file (this is your staging directory for the
installation process), and run the script to create the /etc/oratab
file. This file is used by Oracle's startup script to determine
which instances are running on the machine, and whether they should
autostart when the machine is rebooted. More on this file later.
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /home/oracle/orainst/orainst
ORACLE_OWNER=oracle; export ORACLE_OWNER
sh oratab.sh
</pre>


See <a href="3572f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a> for prompts and their
replies.
</p><p>Log out as root and log in as <b  >oracle</b>. Make
sure <b  >umask</b> is set to <b  >022</b> by
typing <b  >umask</b>. If it is not set to
<b  >022</b>, you will need to add a line to your
.profile file. Set the following environment variables in oracle's
.profile:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle
ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/8.0.5
ORACLE_SID=greg #(replace with your system

  ORACLE_TERM
export PATH TMPDIR
umask 022 #(only if the umask is not already
          #set to 022)
</pre><p>Log out, then log back in as <b  >oracle</b>. Make
sure the environment variables are set by using the
<span   class="bold"><b>env</b></span> command, and that
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin is in your path.

installer.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /home/oracle/orainst/orainst
./orainst /c
</pre><p>Select the custom install (see <a href="3572f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure
2</a>). Read the preamble.txt file and press return to
continue. Read the README.FIRST file and press return to continue.
Select Install, Upgrade or De-install Software (see
<a href="3572f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3</a>). Select Install New
Product&mdash;Do Not Create DB Objects (see
<a href="3572f4.jpg" target="_self">Figure 4</a>). Make sure the
<b  >ORACLE_BASE</b> and <b  >ORACLE_HOME</b>
environment variables are set correctly (see
<a href="3572f5.jpg" target="_self">Figure 5</a>). Press return to accept
the defaults for your log files. It's a good idea to make a note of
their locations, too. If anything goes wrong during the
installation process, you may need to look at them. It is also a
good idea to look at them even if everything works fine in order to
learn more about the installation process (see
<a href="3572f6.jpg" target="_self">Figure 6</a>). Select Install from
Staging Area (see <a href="3572f7.jpg" target="_self">Figure 7</a>); make
sure the staging area is set correctly. In my example, I used
/home/oracle/orainst (see <a href="3572f8.jpg" target="_self">Figure
8</a>). Select your language (see
<a href="3572f9.jpg" target="_self">Figure 9</a>). Press return to
acknowledge the location of the root.sh post-install script. The
default location is /u01/app/oracle/product/8.0.5/orainst/root.sh.
Select the following products to install (see
<a href="3572f10.jpg" target="_self">Figure 10</a>):
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Client Software</p></li><li><p>Net8</p></li><li><p>TCP/IP Protocol Adapter</p></li><li><p>Object Type Translator</p></li><li><p>Oracle ConText Cartridge</p></li><li><p>Oracle8 Objects Option</p></li><li><p>Oracle8 Partitioning Option</p></li><li><p>Oracle Unix Installer</p></li><li><p>Oracle8 Enterprise (RDBMS)</p></li><li><p>PL/SQL</p></li><li><p>Pro*C/C++ (precompiler for C and C++)</p></li><li><p>SQL*Plus</p></li></ul></div>

Use the space bar to select/deselect the products. Do not install
the documentation. We will do that in a later step. After selecting
all the products you want to install, tab to the Install prompt and
press return. You will receive a warning about
<b  >ULIMIT</b> not being set. You can ignore this by
pressing return (see <a href="3572f11.jpg" target="_self">Figure 11</a>).
Select <b  >dba</b> as your DBA group (see
<a href="3572f12.jpg" target="_self">Figure 12</a>). If you decided to
create a separate group for operation of the database, enter it for
the <b  >OSOPER</b> group (refer to snapshot
<a href="3572f13.jpg" target="_self">Figure 13</a>). For this install, I
used the <b  >dba</b> group as the
<b  >OSOPER</b> group.
</p><p><a href="3572f14.jpg" target="_self">Figure 14</a></p><p>At this point, the installer will begin copying the software.
This is a good time to take a break, since this could take a
while&mdash;how long will depend on the speed of your machine.</p><p>When the software installation process is complete, you
should get a message that says &ldquo;The requested action has been
performed for selected products.&rdquo; (See
<a href="3572f15.jpg" target="_self">Figure 15</a>) Press return to
acknowledge the message, tab to Exit, then press return. tab to
indicate Yes on the Confirmation and press return to exit the
installer. The installer should exit with the message &ldquo;Result:
Success&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x173e580.0x1c31140"></a>Documentation Installation</h2></div></div><p>Make the directory where the on-line documentation will be
installed (<b  >mkdir&nbsp;/u01/app/oracle/doc</b>). Link
the directory to correct a bug in the install process:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s /u01/app/oracle/doc /u01/app/oracle/product/8.0.5
</pre><p>Start the installer from your staging directory
(<b  >./orainst&nbsp;/c</b>). Select custom install.
Click on OK to bypass the README files. Select Install, Upgrade or
De-install software. Select Add/Upgrade Software. Press enter to
acknowledge the environment variable setting for ORACLE_HOME. Press
enter to acknowledge the location of the log files. Select Install
from Staging Area. Press enter to acknowledge the path of the
staging area. Select the appropriate language. Select Append to
append to the root.sh script created during the software
installation process. This is done because we haven't run the
script yet, and we don't want to overlay the script created in the
previous step. Press return at the Information screen, which gives
the location for the root.sh script. Select the Intel LINUX
Documentation and tab to install. Press return to begin the
installation process. Press return to acknowledge the location of
the on-line documentation (see <a href="3572f16.jpg" target="_self">Figure
16</a>). Select the format (HTML or PDF) you want for the
on-line documentation (see <a href="3572f17.jpg" target="_self">Figure
17</a>). Once again, we're looking for the message, &ldquo;The
requested action has been performed for selected products.&rdquo; Press
return to acknowledge the message, tab to Exit, then press return.
Select Yes from the Confirmation screen to exit the installer.
Again, we hope to see the installer exit with a message of
&ldquo;Result: Success&rdquo;.

where SID is the system identifier for the instance, file is
located in the $ORACLE_HOME/dbs directory. This file is read by
Oracle when the instance is started. It is used to set parameters
for the instance, such as the amount of memory reserved for the
database. There are too many parameters to go over in this article.
Refer to the Oracle database administrator's guide for an
explanation of the parameters and their recommended settings. You
will probably be fine with the default values. However, if you have
a large amount of memory on your machine, you may want to uncomment
either the medium or large settings of the parameters in the
initSID.ora file.</p><p>The oratab file is located in the /etc directory. This file
is read by the dbstart file which we will use to automatically
start the instance when the machine is rebooted. There are comments
in the oratab file which explain the three fields and what they
contain. Change the last field to Y for instances in which you want
to start when the machine is rebooted. The file should look
something like Listing 1.</p><p><a href="3572l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>The listener.ora file is located in the

Linux (8.1.5 or Oracle8i) is slightly different. The installer has
been rewritten in Java so the look and feel along with some of the
responses are different. This section will cover the differences in
the new install process.</p><p>You still need to create your dba group, oracle user,
directories and mount points.</p><p>Download and install JRE (or JDK) 1.1.6 v5 from
<a href="http://www.blackdown.org" target="_self">http://www.blackdown.org/</a>.
Create a symbolic link for the directory in which you installed
JRE.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ln -s <span   class="emphasis"><em>jre_install_location</em></span> /usr/local/jre
</pre><p>Mount the CD-ROM which contains the Oracle8i software:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
</pre>


Log on as oracle and change directories to the CD-ROM and start the
installer:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /mnt/cdrom
 ./runInstaller
</pre>


</p><p>You should see a welcome screen like
<a href="3572f29.jpg" target="_self">Figure 29</a>. Click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;. You
will be prompted for the location of the installation jar file and
your Oracle home directory. Make any necessary changes and click
&ldquo;Next&rdquo; (<a href="3572f30.jpg" target="_self">Figure 30</a>). Enter the
dba group you created in the previous step
(<a href="3572f31.jpg" target="_self">Figure 31</a>) and click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;.
You will be prompted to run /tmp/OraInstall/orainstRoot.sh
(<a href="3572f32.jpg" target="_self">Figure 32</a>). After you run it, you
should see the following lines of output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Creating Oracle Inventory pointer file (/etc/oraInst.loc)
Changing group name of /u01/app/oracle/product/oraInventory to dba.
Return to the pop-up window and click Retry.
</pre><p><a href="3572f43.jpg" target="_self">Figure 43</a>
</p><p>You will be prompted to install the Oracle8i Enterprise
Server, Oracle8i Client or Oracle Programmer. Select the
&ldquo;Enterprise Serveri&rdquo; (<a href="3572f47.jpg" target="_self">Figure 47</a>)
and click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;. You will be prompted for the type of install.
Select &ldquo;Custom&rdquo; (<a href="3572f33.jpg" target="_self">Figure 33</a>) and
click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;. You will be prompted for which products you want to
install (Figures <a href="3572f34.jpg" target="_self">34</a>,
<a href="3572f35.jpg" target="_self">35</a>,
<a href="3572f36.jpg" target="_self">36</a>). After you have selected the
products to install, click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;. You can change the locations
the products will be installed in or click &ldquo;Next&rdquo; to take the
defaults (<a href="3572f37.jpg" target="_self">Figure 37</a>). You will be
prompted to create the database using the Oracle Database
Configuration Assistant (DBCA). Select &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;
(<a href="3572f38.jpg" target="_self">Figure 38</a>). You will be prompted
for the Global Database Name and the SID. Modify the screen capture
to reflect your names (<a href="3572f39.jpg" target="_self">Figure 39</a>).
You will be prompted for the location of your database files. In my
example, I used the mount point /u01
(<a href="3572f40.jpg" target="_self">Figure 40</a>). You will prompted to
select which network protocol(s) to install based on which
protocols are present on your machine
(<a href="3572f41.jpg" target="_self">Figure 41</a>) click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;. You
will see a summary of your install options. This will allow you to
use the &ldquo;Previous&rdquo; button to change any settings that are
incorrect (<a href="3572f42.jpg" target="_self">Figure 42</a>). When you
are ready to begin the install process click &ldquo;Install&rdquo;. The
install screen will list where the log file from the install is
being written (<a href="3572f44.jpg" target="_self">Figure 44</a>). This
information will come in handy if something goes wrong during the
installation. When the install is complete, you will see a pop-up
window (<a href="3572f45.jpg" target="_self">Figure 45</a>). Note the
location of the script to run as root, change to the directory
where the root.sh script is located and run it. You may have to
change the permissions on it to make it executable.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /u01/app/oracle/product/8.1.5
export ORACLE_OWNER=oracle
export ORACLE_SID=greg
chmod 700 root.sh
 ./root.sh
</pre><p>After the root.sh script successfully executes (expected
output in <a href="3572f46.jpg" target="_self">Figure 46</a>) return to the
pop-up message and click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;. At this point the installation is
complete, and you can click &ldquo;Next&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Exit&rdquo;. The testing
and automation procedures are the same as in the previous section
for Oracle 8.0.5.</p><p>All listings referred to in this article are available by
