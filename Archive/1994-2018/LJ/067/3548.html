    Linux is flourishing in Brazil. There is a Brazilian
    distribution, several high-traffic mailing lists, articles
    on mainstream newspapers and many users. Now, they have
    their first Linux User's Association.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2202580.0x22fa3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>As in the rest of the world, Linux is
doing quite well in Brazil, thank you. The rapid increase in the
number of users is stimulated by the availability of a Red
Hat-based Brazilian distribution
(<a href="http://www.conectiva.com.br" target="_self">http://www.conectiva.com.br/</a>)
with translated documentation, internationalized programs and an
installation manual in Portuguese.
</p><p>There are several Linux-related mailing lists, the largest of
which
(<a href="http://linux-br.conectiva.com.br" target="_self">http://linux-br.conectiva.com.br/</a>)
has, as of May '99, more than 2000 subscribers. Linux is receiving
extensive coverage in the Brazilian media, from technical
publications to mainstream newspapers and business-oriented
magazines.</p><p>Since Linux users tend to wander in herds, many Linux Users
Groups (LUGs) can be found throughout the country. From time to
time, there's discussion about a national LUG, a difficult task on
which no concrete actions have been taken so far. Or hadn't until
April 24th, when the first official S&atilde;o Paulo Linux User's
Association (LinuxSP) meeting took place. We hope it was the first
step toward a national association.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2202580.0x22fa608"></a>What is LinuxSP?</h2></div></div><p>LinuxSP is the first Linux users association in Brazil. Its
home is S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil's biggest city.</p><p>In Brazil, creating an association requires much paperwork
and usually the payment of some fees. LUGs, therefore, are
&ldquo;informal&rdquo; in the sense that they are not registered anywhere.
With all the trouble it takes to register an association, why did
we bother?</p><p>Certain advantages of an association appealed to us. To begin
with, it sounds respectable. With Linux rapidly taking over the
business world, companies want a name they can rely on. Reporters
want a phone number to call (or an e-mail address to contact) when
they need to write about Linux. In short, we intend to be a
reference for Linux-related subjects in S&atilde;o Paulo and in
Brazil. As an association, we can also legally receive donations
and register domains (such as linuxsp.org.br), which can be done
only by registered &ldquo;entities&rdquo; (associations, corporations,
etc.).</p><p>Apart from that, LinuxSP is basically a LUG; we'll promote
installfests, lectures, Linux courses, etc. Above all, we want to
put Linux users in contact with each other. It is not our intention
to &ldquo;rule the Brazilian Linux universe&rdquo;. We'll support the LUGs as
much as we can with the infrastructure we've built&mdash;not replace
them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2202580.0x22fa818"></a>A Bit of History</h2></div></div><p>The original idea for LinuxSP started in late '97, with an
unsuccessful meeting of Linux users in S&atilde;o Paulo. To put it
simply, four people showed up. We formed a small LUG of our own and
started meeting regularly. In '98, we decided to try again, this
time with much more success (over 100 people came). Our next
&ldquo;enterprise&rdquo;, an installfest, succeeded in bringing many people
and failed in every other respect, except we learned a hard lesson
about organization.</p><p>Finally, after another meeting, we gathered a group of people
interested in leading the creation of a Linux users association.
After much discussion on all aspects of having an association, it
was finally legally created. As a landmark, we called a meeting to
be LinuxSP's first official one. We estimated around 500 people had
passed through during the day. When we counted our guest book, more
than 850 had been present! That showed us LinuxSP had come just in
time. As far as we know, it was the biggest Linux event in Brazil
up to that time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2202580.0x22fa978"></a>How LinuxSP Works</h2></div></div><p>The association is based on work groups. Every member of the
association can join one or more groups, each of which focuses on a
certain area, such as events, development, documentation, etc.
Access to work groups is not limited to members; anyone who wishes
can join the groups. LinuxSP was created for the Linux community,
not just its members.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2202580.0x22faa80"></a>What Now?</h2></div></div><p>LinuxSP was very well received in S&atilde;o Paulo and
elsewhere in Brazil. Many people signed up for membership at the
first meeting, and e-mails just keep coming. If you're planning on
starting something similar, have everything ready for twice as many
people as you expect to show up. We were surprised by the response
to LinuxSP, and that caused a bit of delay in some changes we
needed to make in order to accommodate all the people who wanted to
join us.</p><p>The next step now is actually getting things done. The work
groups are starting to get organized and we hope to have the
association walking on its own feet (as opposed to having the 12
founding members organizing everything) very soon. The Brazilian
Linux community has accepted us.</p><p>For more information, visit
