    Using Linux and the ACEDB database system makes easy work of
    local area network management.

efficient design and implementation of specialty tools for specific
tasks. On a data network, engineers and administrators appreciate
the ease and flexibility with which Linux can be implemented as a
platform for data collection, analysis and processing. In this
article I'll demonstrate techniques for implementing ACEDB (an
object-oriented database) and a few other tools to provide
comprehensive access to administrative data that you might already
be collecting from your network.
</p><p>The management of TCP/IP local area networks often entails an
enduring struggle to control address space. Workstations, servers
and managed subsystems (routers, firewalls, etc.) are all added to
and subtracted from the network as the shape of the organization
and the flow of data changes. However, remembering which machine is
assigned to a particular IP address is not always as simple as
keeping an up-to-date list of IP address to node assignments.
Sometimes network architecture changes without proper documentation
even under the best of circumstances&mdash;DHCP, BOOTP, ubiquitous SNMP
and managed repeater ports included. Yet, keeping track of IP
address assignments is important. Since the logical address space
of an IP subnet is limited to a finite number of usable addresses,
recycling IP addresses is a must. It's also useful to know the kind
of machine responsible for a particular instance of packet
generation when performing data-analysis on a LAN (metrics
collection, troubleshooting, security audits, etc.). Automating the
collection of and access to this information would go a long way
toward reclaiming lost or unknown administrative data.</p><p>If you haven't yet discovered Arpwatch (available via
anonymous ftp at ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/arpwatch.tar.Z), please allow
me to introduce you. From Arpwatch's man page, &ldquo;Arpwatch keeps
track of Ethernet and IP address pairings. It syslogs activity and
reports certain changes via e-mail.&rdquo; Arpwatch uses the libpcap API
(ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/libpcap.tar.Z) to listen for and capture ARP
(address resolution protocol) requests and replies on a local
Ethernet interface.</p><p>RFC 826 introduces the origins of the address resolution
protocol, but you may find a more up-to-date description in your
favorite networking handbook. For the purposes of this column, ARP
is the method by which any machine on a logical TCP/IP subnet
determines the Ethernet address (sometimes called a hardware or MAC
(mandatory access control) address) of any other machine on the
same logical subnet. ARP with respect to unicast data
communications on a LAN provides a &ldquo;sending node&rdquo; with the
Ethernet address of the &ldquo;receiving node&rdquo;--information essential
to the successful completion of a communications transaction. The
sending node generates an ARP request, a broadcast heard by all
machines on the network asking for the machine assigned a specific
IP address to respond with its Ethernet address. An ARP reply comes
from the machine owning the particular IP address and contains its
own Ethernet address as an answer to the query.</p><p>Arpwatch listens to the ARP conversations taking place
between the machines on a network, extracts Ethernet address, IP
address pairings from the dialogue, and stores the results with a
timestamp in a local table. As ARP happens over time, this table
grows to represent an accurate list of the available nodes on a
network. Arpwatch cross references a machine's Ethernet address
against a list of vendor descriptions of network interfaces,
formats a report of its findings, and finally, e-mails the report
or prints it to STDERR, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
From: arpwatch (Arpwatch)
To: root
Subject: new station (node.yourdomain.com)
   hostname:  node.yourdomain.com
   ip address:  192.168.10.10
   Ethernet address:  0:a0:24:56:c4:3a
   Ethernet vendor:  3com
   timestamp:  Sunday, May 9, 1999 11:16:57 -0400
</pre><p>Arpwatch only processes information collected from the same
logical network that the interface it listens on participates in.
This is true even if the LAN has been designed so that different
subnets share the same physical wire for data transmission.
Collecting data from multiple logical subnetworks requires the
execution of separate instances of Arpwatch, one for each logical
subnet, each tied to an autonomous network interface. Since Linux
allows multiple network interfaces to reside in the same system
(reference the &ldquo;Mini-HOWTO on using multiple Ethernet adapters
with Linux&rdquo;), this can be conveniently accomplished in a single
box. A modest PC with one Intel 486 DX-2 66 processor and an ISA
bus can easily collect data from several busy subnetworks.
Conversely, since Linux and Arpwatch are both readily obtained,
multiple Arpwatch collection stations, one for each subnetwork, can
be established if preferred.
</p><p>Typically, Arpwatch is configured to distribute the
information it collects via sendmail. This functions well as an
alert mechanism with respect to changes within or additions to the
network infrastructure, yet the utility of an Arpwatch report is
therefore limited to the expression of this information in a static
e-mail message. Sure, these reports can be searched and archived,
but wouldn't it be useful to process and funnel the information
collected by Arpwatch into a database? In this way Arpwatch's
reports could be supplemented with a description of the node's
responsible individual, its physical location, its operating
system, its primary function or any number of other useful
attributes.</p><p>The ACEDB database system was created by Richard Durbin and
Jean Thierry-Mieg to provide a flexible and dynamic storage medium
for a complex data set in support of their biological research.
ACEDB is flexible in that it allows for a wide variety of different
kinds of data to be stored. It is dynamic in that the structure of
the database is easily modified as the data either comes to be
understood differently over time or as it changes shape, such as
through the addition of a new attribute or a new data type. ACEDB
is also object-oriented, meaning that organization of data within
the system preserves the real-world uniqueness and autonomy of each
individual data object. Data within an ACEDB database is easily
accessible because it is not sliced up into constituent parts and
stored within relational tables. This provides for more intuitive
access to data than is typical within many classic relational or
object-relational database management systems. Don't get too
hung-up on ACEDB's &ldquo;object-oriented&rdquo; tag. ACEDB's flair for
objects simply means that it is easy to create and understand
complex relationships between different kinds of data.</p><p>ACEDB is easily implemented within Linux. You'll find the
latest distribution in the index at
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/acedb/ace4/. Fetch a copy of
the INSTALL script and examine the NOTES and README files for news
and installation instructions. Download binary distributions of the
ACEDB database and server, each of which has been precompiled for
libc6.</p><p>Like Linux, ACEDB has enjoyed the benefits of collaborative
engineering and development that are characteristic of an
open-source software product. One of the major contributors to the
ACEDB project is Lincoln Stein, perhaps best known for his work as
the author of the CGI.pm module for Perl-based CGI scripting. Mr.
Stein has created Jade, a Java-based interface between ACEDB and
the Java programming language. He's also written an award-winning,
object-oriented Perl interface for ACEDB called AcePerl. AcePerl
provides functionality for connecting to and updating ACEDB
databases, performing queries, fetching objects and other
administrative tasks. To compliment AcePerl Mr. Stein has created
and released AceBrowser, a small set of CGI scripts which work with
AcePerl to provide for the easy creation of a web-browsable
interface to any ACEDB database. In this column, we'll use both
AcePerl and AceBrowser to build, view and modify the database of IP
host data collected by Arpwatch. You'll find links to the latest
versions of AcePerl and AceBrowser at http://stein.cshl.org/.
Download these distributions and make sure your local Perl is up to
date (<b  >perl -v</b> should report version 5.004_04 or
higher). One goal of this project is to make the data stored in the
ACEDB database available via the Web, so you'll also need a web
server. Of course, the Apache web server is freely available from
http://www.apache.org/. Finally, AceBrowser references CGI.pm, so
make sure you've got version 2.46 or higher installed. CGI.pm is
available at http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/software/CGI/.</p><p>We're going to use Linux to build a single system that
functions as an Arpwatch collection station (a platform for storing
the collected data in an ACEDB database), an ACEDB server and a web
server for providing natural access to this data from anywhere on
the network.</p><p>Install the ACEDB distribution via the INSTALL script. ACEDB
comes with both a graphical (<span   class="bold"><b>xace</b></span>)
and a text-based (<span   class="bold"><b>tace</b></span>) front end,
each of which provide easy access to the system. Accessing an ACEDB
database is as simple as running the
<span   class="bold"><b>acedb</b></span> script from the top-level
directory of an ACEDB installation and using the GUI to navigate
through the data structure. Though ACEDB is powerful and highly
customizable, a few other things must be known before getting
started.</p><p>In an ACEDB installation, content of the files in the /wspec
directory defines the ACEDB environment&mdash;everything from the
appearance of xace's GUI interface and the allocation of cache
space on the local disk to the internal definition of data
structures. Rely on the default values presented in these files and
verify that your user name is included in the passwd.wrm file in
the list of authorized users. The key to understanding and getting
started with ACEDB comes from an examination of the models.wrm,
file also known as the &ldquo;Model File&rdquo;. The Model File is a template
that defines both the structure of objects within the database and
relationships that exists between objects. Each object in an ACEDB
database has both a class and a name. An object's class describes
the type of object that it is, and an object's name serves to
uniquely identify it. Using ACEDB jargon, I could describe myself
as an object of class &ldquo;person&rdquo; with the name of &ldquo;Joe&rdquo;. Or, if I
were building a personnel database for a company, it might be more
useful to describe myself as an object of class &ldquo;Engineer&rdquo; with a
name of &ldquo;NasalJS&rdquo;, for example. I could make the object
&ldquo;NasalJS&rdquo; more useful still by attaching a tag called
&ldquo;Full_name&rdquo; to it with a value of &ldquo;Joseph S. Nasal&rdquo; and a tag
called &ldquo;Birthday&rdquo; with a value of &ldquo;06June1969&rdquo;, so that people
who use my database will know some additional information about
&ldquo;NasalJS&rdquo;. ACEDB objects are built like this with a tree-like
hierarchy of tags and values. The object file's content, called the
schema, represents the generic structure (or form) of each object
class within an ACEDB database including the tags used to build
objects and give them meaning.</p><p>The schema can be complex (as it is with the databases of
genome sequences for which ACEDB was originally written) or simple
depending on the data and the requirements of the application.
We'll begin with a very simple schema to represent the data
collected via Arpwatch. We can use the format of an Arpwatch report
to suggest the structure of our ACEDB objects and create a schema
that looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
?Host   host_name UNIQUE Text
   ip_address UNIQUE Text
   ethernet_address current_ea UNIQUE Text
                         previous_ea Text
   ethernet_vendor  current_ev UNIQUE
      ?EtherType XREF participating_nodes
                         previous_ev Text
   timestamp current_ts UNIQUE Text
                  previous_ts Text
                  delta_ts Text
?EtherType   participating_nodes ?Host XREF
   ethernet_vendor
</pre><p>This schema defines two classes of objects,
<b  >Host</b> and <b  >EtherType</b> (classes
are identified using the syntax <b  >?Classname</b>). In
the <b  >Host</b> class, the <b  >host_name</b>
tag has been constructed to contain a text value which is further
described by the capitalized directive <b  >UNIQUE</b>.
Therefore, in an object of class <b  >Host</b> the
<b  >host_name</b> tag will contain text and have no more
than one data value. Similarly, the <b  >ip_address</b>
tag also utilizes the <b  >UNIQUE</b> directive and may
contain only data of type <b  >Text</b>. Notice that the
tags <b  >ethernet_address</b>,
<b  >ethernet_vendor</b> and <b  >timestamp</b>
are each complex data types which are further described by their
respective subtags.
</p><p>An ACEDB database may utilize other data types (such as
<b  >Int</b>, <b  >Float</b> and
<b  >DateType</b>, for example) but we'll keep things
simple and treat all of the Arpwatch data as plain text. Directives
other than <b  >UNIQUE</b> are also available. In this
example, the <b  >XREF</b> directive is used to establish
a cross-reference relationship between the
<b  >current_ev</b> subtag within the class
<b  >Host</b> and the
<b  >participating_nodes</b> tag within the class
EtherType. The effect of this will be to build lists of
<b  >Host</b> objects which share a common network
interface vendor.</p><p><a href="3517l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>To test this schema, we can fire-up xace via the acedb script
and load a flat file containing sample data, as shown in Listing 1.
In this example file, objects are separated by blank lines, and
each tag of every object occupies its own row. Notice that when
providing a value for complex data types, only the rightmost subtag
needs to be specified. To test the schema, save this data in a file
with an extension of .ace in the top-level directory of the ACEDB
installation. Edit the contents of the layout.wrm file in the
/wspec directory to contain two lines, the first being
<b  >Host</b> and the second
<b  >EtherType</b>, so that xace will display these
sample objects by default in the GUI. Start up xace and import the
data file by selecting &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; and &ldquo;Read an .ace file&rdquo;. After
opening the data file and reading in the data, use the GUI to
navigate through the data set. Observe how objects are presented in
accordance with the template established in the model file,
including the results of the cross-reference relationship between
objects of class <b  >Host</b> and objects of class
<b  >EtherType</b>.</p><p>In the <span   class="emphasis"><em>live</em></span> system, we'll funnel
Arpwatch records directly into the database using AcePerl. The
first step is to capture Arpwatch's output to a file. Arpwatch's
man page reads, &ldquo;Starting Arpwatch with the <b  >-d</b>
flag inhibits forking into the background and e-mailing reports.
Instead, they are sent to STDERR.&rdquo; Using redirection, we can save
Arpwatch's reports to a file, like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
arpwatch -d &gt; report.data
</pre><p><a href="3517l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>
</p><p>Perl is the perfect tool for extracting record data and
building the database. In Listing 2, you'll find code which
utilizes Mr. Stein's AcePerl modules to connect with an ACEDB
server listening at port 20000100 on the local machine. After
connecting with the server, the script drops into a loop of
fetching Arpwatch records from the data file. When a complete
record has been built, the last &ldquo;else&rdquo; condition in the while
loop calls the &ldquo;process&rdquo; subroutine to update the database.
First, the subroutine removes unnecessary whitespace and checks to
see if <b  >$host_name</b> contains the string
<b  >&lt;unknown&gt;</b> (if Arpwatch is unable to
resolve the name associated with a node's IP address it marks the
record <b  >&lt;unknown&gt;</b>). Since we're going to
use the data in <b  >$host_name</b> to name ACEDB Host
objects, the code translates <b  >&lt;unknown&gt;</b>
into a unique identifier based upon timestamp and the current
Ethernet address.</p><p>Next, the data in <b  >$host_name</b> and AcePerl's
<span   class="bold"><b>fetch</b></span> method are used to see if a
corresponding <b  >Host</b> object exists. If it doesn't,
a new <b  >Host</b> object is created using AcePerl's
<span   class="bold"><b>new</b></span> method, and the object is
built by adding value to its tags with AcePerl's
<span   class="bold"><b>add</b></span> method. Finally, the new
<b  >Host</b> object is written to the database with a
call to AcePerl's <span   class="bold"><b>commit</b></span>
method.</p><p>If it turns out that Arpwatch is only reporting some new
information about an existing <b  >Host</b> object, then
<span   class="bold"><b>process</b></span> uses AcePerl's add and
commit methods to simply update the existing object with the new
data. Finally, the new record flag is reset and the subroutine
exits back into the <b  >while</b> loop to collect more
record data.</p><p>When all of the records in the file have been objectified and
added to the database, the script pauses for five minutes, then
utilizes Perl's native <span   class="bold"><b>seek</b></span>
function to reset the end-of-file error condition. This trick
allows the code to follow and process the growing data file
(emulating UNIX's <b  >tail -f</b> command) as Arpwatch
continues to collect more records.</p><p>As easy as that, we've built an ACEDB database by turning
Arpwatch reports into objects and processing them with AcePerl.
However, we've barely touched upon ACEDB's power for data
representation and AcePerl's flexibility as an API for building and
manipulating ACEDB objects. With a little bit more coding, for
example, we could call methods within the SNMP Perl module to probe
and collect data from SNMP-aware devices on the network and add
this data to <b  >Host</b> objects as they are built or
updated. Or, we could add subclasses to the <b  >Host</b>
object based upon machine type (server, router, firewall, etc.).
Any functional modifications which require changes to object
definitions within the schema are easily handled by ACEDB. Go ahead
and make the change and then let ACEDB automatically update the
structure of existing objects within the database.</p><p>The last step is to make this database of Arpwatch records
available via the Web. Mr. Stein's AceBrowser CGI scripts provide
an easy solution. Unpack and install AceBrowser in a subdirectory
of your web server's CGI directory. AceBrowser comes with a set of
scripts for fetching, displaying and interacting with text and
static GIF images stored in an ACEDB database. AceBrowser code is
provided as an excellent starting point for creating custom web
interfaces to any ACEDB database. However, AceBrowser's
model-independent scripts can be used to display our data right out
of the box, without modification. Follow the instructions for
supplying the information in the site-specific global definitions
(the location of the ACEDB server, the HTML stylesheet, etc.) and
fire-up your web browser. I've used the
<span   class="bold"><b>simple</b></span> search script to discover
the <b  >Host</b> object presented in Figure 1. The
object is displayed using AceBrowser's
<span   class="bold"><b>tree</b></span> script and is represented
on-screen to mirror the object's structure as defined in the Model
File. Notice that the data in the <b  >current_ev</b> tag
is represented as a hotlink. The cross-reference relationship
defined in the schema creates lists of <b  >Host</b>
objects which share a common network interface vendor. In this
example, the hotlink leads to a browsable list of hosts which use
network interfaces manufactured by 3Com Corporation.</p><p>With ease and only a little bit of coding, we've used Linux
and the ACEDB database to create a powerful tool for the collection
of IP administrative data on a LAN. Linux and ACEDB are a good
match because they are both flexible enough to allow for the
invention of specialized databases on the fly and powerful enough
to ensure data integrity. Lincoln Stein's AcePerl modules provide a
powerful and friendly API for interacting with an ACEDB database,
and his AceBrowser scripts are ready-made to interface with any
ACEDB database over the Web.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? What can you make Linux and
ACEDB do?</p><p>All listings referred to in this article are available by
