the web? A better question might be, &ldquo;Why
<span   class="emphasis"><em>wouldn't</em></span> one want to link a database to the
web?&rdquo; Static HTML pages are good for many things: documentation,
hypertext books, personal pages and other unchanging information.
However, static pages present a few problems:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Static pages can be a hassle to maintain. If one is
managing a large site with thousands of pages, changing just the
&ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; of the site will involve either an inordinate
amount of work or a long evening with CGI and Perl. This gets even
nastier when the content of the site changes.</p></li><li><p>Static pages don't allow for user input, feedback
or collaboration. Suppose you want to add a message board to your
static web site. You can set up a form that mails user comments to
the webmaster, who manually puts them on a page&mdash;you can even set
up a script to do this. However, this presents a few problems, as
we shall discuss later.</p></li><li><p>Static pages don't allow you to operate a web
service. One can operate a web site with static HTML, but some of
the most useful web sites today, such as Slashdot
(<a href="http://slashdot.org" target="_self">http://slashdot.org/</a>),
CNN (<a href="http://www.cnn.com" target="_self">http://www.cnn.com/</a>)
and Amazon.com
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_self">http://www.amazon.com/</a>),
are services offering dynamic database-backed content.</p></li></ul></div>

A database management system provides uniform access to structured
data, much like an object-oriented programming language provides a
uniform way to store data and define methods to act on that data.
If you're writing a program in C++ and you need to deal with
strings, would you rather wrap all associated routines in a class
or deal with the fact that your string is really a <b  >char
*</b> each time you operate on it? With a database, one is
offered a layer of abstraction between how the data is actually
stored and how one uses it, which is quite useful for several
reasons. You could achieve the same results with C or Perl scripts,
but it wouldn't be as pretty and could get downright ugly.
</p><p>I hope this quick rundown is enough to convince you that you
really want to use a database for your dynamic web site. In this
article, I will present instructions for installing PHP3
(<a href="http://www.php.net" target="_self">http://www.php.net/</a>) and
PostgreSQL
(<a href="http://www.postgresql.org" target="_self">http://www.postgresql.org/</a>),
a little bit of theory, some instructions for using SQL and PHP3,
and an example application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0xed0920"></a>Installing the Tools</h2></div></div><p>This description assumes you are running Red Hat, but most of
these instructions will be applicable to other distributions; these
tools are fairly painless to install from source, anyway.</p><p>Here's a list of what you'll need to run the example
application and develop your own applications:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Apache 1.3 or greater. You will need at least
version 1.3, because 1.2 does not support modules, and PHP is
faster and more secure as a module. On a Red Hat system, you'll
need both the <span   class="bold"><b>apache</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>apache-devel</b></span> packages. (Make sure
you have the file apxs installed, because we're going to recompile
the PHP3 Apache module.)</p></li><li><p>The source RPM for PHP3, version 3.0 or
greater.</p></li><li><p>PostgreSQL 6.4 or greater; the example code will
not run on version 6.3 without a little editing, because 6.4 has an
SQL parser.</p></li></ul></div><p>To rebuild PHP3 for PostgreSQL support, take the following
steps:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Use <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> to become
root.</p></li><li><p>Install the source RPM for PHP3
(<b  >rpm&nbsp;-ihv&nbsp;mod_php3-3.0.5-2.src.rpm</b> on
Red Hat 6.0). This will place a &ldquo;spec file&rdquo; in the directory
/usr/src/redhat/SPECS and a tar file of the source in
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES. Since the PHP module that comes with Red
Hat doesn't have database support enabled by default, we'll have to
recompile it. RPM makes this fairly painless.</p></li><li><p>Because the PHP3 installation process assumes a
default PostgreSQL installation, not the Red Hat one, we'll need to
make some symlinks. Create a directory /usr/local/pgsql and make
symbolic links from /usr/include/pgsql to /usr/local/pgsql/include
and from /usr/lib/ to /usr/local/pgsql/lib.</p></li><li><p>Invoke your favorite editor on the spec file
(mod_php3.spec) and search for ./configure; then add the configure
option <b  >--with-pgsql</b>.</p></li><li><p>Now build a binary package with rpm:
<b  >/rpm&nbsp;-bb&nbsp;mod_php3.spec/</b></p></li><li><p>If all goes well, you'll have a binary package in
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/arch, where /arch is your architecture.
Install it, and you're ready to move on.</p></li></ol></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0xed13c8"></a>Setting up PostgreSQL</h2></div></div><p>PostgreSQL uses a different access system than the rest of
your system; oddly enough, not even root has access to the database
by default. The database system has its own user system and
passwords, and postgres is the database administrator account by
default. The advantage to the separate access system is that one
can create database users who do not have UNIX accounts; this way,
the database for your web application can specify access control
without creating a potential security hole for your system. To add
your web administrator (web) as a database user, use
<span   class="bold"><b>createuser</b></span> (as root):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# su postgres -c createuser
Enter name of user to add ---&gt; web
Enter user's postgres ID, or RETURN to use UNIX user id: 542 -&gt; 542
Is user "web" allowed to create databases (y/n) y
Is user "web" allowed to add users? (y/n) y
createuser: web was successfully added
</pre><p>Then, as web (or whatever account you used), you'll be able
to create a database with <b  >createdb foo</b> and then
try some queries on foo using <b  >psql foo</b>.
</p><p>You'll also need to set up PostgreSQL to accept incoming
TCP/IP connections so your PHP3 pages can access it. Fortunately,
System V <span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> makes this easy.
Simply open the file /etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql and change the
line</p><pre     class="programlisting">
su postgres -l -c \
 'usr/bin/postmaster -S -D/var/lib/pgsql'
</pre><p>so that it reads
<pre     class="programlisting">
su postgres -l -c \
 '/usr/bin/postmaster -S -D/var/lib/pgsql -i'
</pre>


While you're at it, you will probably want to specify a different
port from the default (5432) for security reasons. To run the
PostgreSQL back end on a different port, merely append a
<b  >-p <i><tt>port</tt></i></b> to the above
line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0xed18f0"></a>All the SQL You Need To Know (Not
Really)</h2></div></div><p>Just about every relational database in the world uses SQL
(or some extended version of SQL) as its query language. SQL allows
you to define tables, select records based on given criteria,
update values in one or many records and delete records. This is
just a brief introduction to SQL; for more complete references, see
Resources.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0xed19f8"></a>Creating Tables</h2></div></div><p>To create a table, one uses the <b  >CREATE
TABLE</b> statement. Its syntax is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE <span   class="emphasis"><em>tablename</em></span> (<span   class="emphasis"><em>field-1</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>type-1</em></span>, ..., <span   class="emphasis"><em>field-n type-n</em></span>)
</pre><p>In psql, you will need to end each statement with a
semicolon. These semicolons are not part of the SQL language, but
rather for the benefit of psql's lexer.
</p><p>You may also declare fields as <b  >NOT NULL</b>,
<b  >UNIQUE</b> or <b  >PRIMARY KEY</b>, or
specify a value as <b  >DEFAULT</b> to a field.
PostgreSQL will create an index on primary key fields.
Unfortunately, as of version 6.4, PostgreSQL does not support
foreign keys, but at least the parser will not choke on the SQL
<b  >REFERENCES</b> keyword.</p><p>Here's an example, akin to the UNIX password file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE passwd
   (username    varchar(8) PRIMARY KEY,
   -- PRIMARY KEY implies UNIQUE
    cryptedpass char(13),
    uid         int UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    gid         int NOT NULL,
    gecos       varchar(80),
    -- the GECOS field (real name, office, etc.)
    homedir     varchar(80),
    shell       varchar(50) DEFAULT '/bin/sh');
</pre><p>Note that SQL uses a double-dash to begin comments, which are
terminated by a newline.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0x12ca2d0"></a>Inserting Data</h2></div></div><p>To insert data into a table, use the
<b  >INSERT</b> statement:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO tablename (<span   class="emphasis"><em>field-1</em></span>, ..., <span   class="emphasis"><em>field-n</em></span>)
VALUES (<span   class="emphasis"><em>value-1</em></span>, ..., <span   class="emphasis"><em>value-n/</em></span>)
</pre><p>You needn't specify field names if you are inserting values
into every field. Here's an example for the table we just created:
<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO passwd (username, cryptedpass,
   uid, gid, gecos, homedir, shell)
VALUES ('fred', '37MniLTaiPLaL', 42, 500,
   'Fred Mbogo', '/home/fred/', '/bin/sh');
</pre>


Note that SQL uses single quotes for string constants. Any closet
Pascal programmers will feel right at home.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0x12ca698"></a>Retrieving Data</h2></div></div><p>The SQL <b  >SELECT</b> statement returns records
where values meet a certain criteria. Here are some examples of
<b  >SELECT</b> in action:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM passwd;
-- returns all fields of all records
SELECT username FROM passwd;
-- returns all usernames
SELECT * FROM passwd WHERE username = 'fred';
SELECT * FROM passwd ORDER BY username, shell;
SELECT * FROM passwd
     WHERE homedir LIKE '/home%'
     -- % is the SQL wildcard character
     AND   shell = '/bin/sh'
     ORDER BY username;
SELECT homedir, projectname
     FROM passwd, projects
     -- assuming we have a projects
     table
     WHERE
     -- this will return the home directory of
       passwd.username = projects.leader;
       -- each project leader for each project
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0x12ca8a8"></a>Keeping Your Data Current</h2></div></div><p>To change field values in records, use
<b  >UPDATE</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
UPDATE <span   class="emphasis"><em>tablename</em></span> SET <span   class="emphasis"><em>field-1</em></span> =
<span   class="emphasis"><em>value-n</em></span> WHERE <span   class="emphasis"><em>qualification</em></span>
</pre><p>The <b  >WHERE</b> is optional, but if you don't
specify a <b  >WHERE</b> clause, SQL will update
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the records, which is clearly the &ldquo;Wrong
Thing&rdquo;.
</p><p>Let's say Fred Mbogo wants to change his shell. This script
will do it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
UPDATE passwd SET shell = '/bin/tcsh' WHERE username = 'fred';
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0x12cadd0"></a>Deleting Records</h2></div></div><p>To delete records, simply use
<b  >DELETE</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
DELETE FROM <span   class="emphasis"><em>tablename</em></span> WHERE <span   class="emphasis"><em>qualifier</em></span>
</pre><p>Just like <b  >UPDATE</b>, the
<b  >WHERE</b> is optional, but you probably want it
anyway. Let's say Fred has offended his sysadmin one too many
times:
<pre     class="programlisting">
DELETE FROM passwd WHERE username = 'fred';
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0x12cb198"></a>All the PHP3 You Need To Know (Not
Really)</h2></div></div><p>The on-line PHP3 manual,
<a href="http://www.php.net/manual" target="_self">http://www.php.net/manual/</a>,
is an excellent reference and will be necessary reading before you
create your own database web application. Furthermore, it is a
database-backed web site and has lots of user comments. Here, we
will examine just the most basic PHP3 features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0x12cb2f8"></a>Using PHP3</h2></div></div><p>Here is a simple PHP3 program, which demonstrates some basic
features. Note the separate HTML and PHP3 blocks:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;title&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;?php
  echo("Hello, world!\n");
  echo("&lt;p&gt;\nWhat a &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; move this is!\n");
?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre><p>This program will send the following HTML to the remote
browser:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;title&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
Hello, world!
&lt;p&gt;
What a &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; move this is!
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>


A similar program, which takes an argument, would look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;title&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;?php
  echo("Hello, $name!\n");
  echo("&lt;p&gt;\nWhat a &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; move this is!\n");
?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>


You would view this page (assuming you called it hello.php3) like
any CGI script:
http://<span   class="emphasis"><em>yourhost</em></span>.net/~fred/hello.php3?name=fred.
This, of course, assumes you are named Fred and have put this file
in your /public_html directory.

databases; the best place to read up on these is
<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/ref.pgsql.php3" target="_self">www.php.net/manual/ref.pgsql.php3</a>,
and we shall examine a few of them.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

Book</h2></div></div><p>Our example application is an address book that one can
access over the Internet. A user logs in with her name and password
and is presented with a menu of options, including browsing and
searching the address book and adding a new person. For each person
in the address book, the database stores an arbitrary number of
e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, URLs and postal addresses.
This address book also has some nifty features like mailing
passwords to new accounts and automatic <b  >mailto</b>
and <b  >href</b> links for e-mail and web
addresses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0x11ddf58"></a>Design Considerations</h2></div></div><p>We have already completed the first step of the design
process&mdash;deciding what we need our application to do. What remains
is defining the data that our application will access in three
iterations:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>A high-level data model</p></li><li><p>A low-level data model</p></li><li><p>A set of views and transactions that are legal for
application users</p></li></ol></div><p>Generally, one initially models databases in an
entity-relationship diagram, which represents each table as an
<span   class="emphasis"><em>entity</em></span> with a set of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>attributes</em></span>, and a &ldquo;join&rdquo;, or query, spanning
multiple tables is represented by a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>relationship</em></span>. Even if you're not going to go
to the trouble of making up an E-R diagram, you should at least
consider these concepts; we shall examine the entities and
relationships for the address book in prose.
</p><p>The low-level model we shall be using is the relational
model, which has been around since 1970 and is the model used by
most commercial relational databases, including Oracle, Sybase and
Informix.</p><p>Finally, we shall define the ways in which our users can see
the data. Once we've completed this, we're done with the hard part
and can move on to the tedious part&mdash;the implementation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0x11de4d8"></a>Entities and Relationships</h2></div></div><p>Since the entity-relationship model is such a high-level
model, some of the hairier issues of the low-level model are not
yet apparent, and our data model looks quite simple. The main
advantage of the E-R model is that it presents a clear picture of
the database miniworld&mdash;the segment of the real world that we're
modeling&mdash;and is easily comprehensible to both laypersons and
software engineers. Entities are defined as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>user</b></span>: This
describes an address book user. This entity has a unique ID, a
login name, a password, a &ldquo;real name&rdquo; and an e-mail
address.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>addressbook</b></span>: This
is a &ldquo;weak entity&rdquo;--a set of persons for which a particular user
has information.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>person</b></span>: This
describes a person for whom address information is available. This
entity has a first name, a middle initial, a last name and a
dynastic identifier (i.e., Jr., III, etc.). A person also has one
or many of each of the following: e-mail address, postal address,
telephone number and URL.</p></li></ul></div><p>Relationships among entities are defined in this way:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A <span   class="bold"><b>user</b></span> owns
exactly one <span   class="bold"><b>addressbook</b></span>.</p></li><li><p>An <span   class="bold"><b>address book</b></span>
contains many <span   class="bold"><b>persons</b></span>.</p></li><li><p>A <span   class="bold"><b>person</b></span> is an
entry in exactly one
<span   class="bold"><b>addressbook</b></span>.</p></li></ul></div>

If you've thought about databases before, you may be asking
yourself, &ldquo;Why can't a <span   class="bold"><b>person</b></span> be
in more than one <span   class="bold"><b>addressbook</b></span>?
Can't two <span   class="bold"><b>users</b></span> know the same
<span   class="bold"><b>person</b></span>?&rdquo; That is the sort of
design decision you must make in this process&mdash;I chose to allow
each user her own, private address book and avoid the difficult
issues raised by sharing records. Allowing many people to share a
record is like allowing global variables in a C program that can be
modified by any function&mdash;you can easily get unexpected results
when one function changes the variable's value without the others
knowing about it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0x11def80"></a>Moving to the Relational Model</h2></div></div><p>Now we need to move our high-level model (which people can
understand) to a low-level model (which our database management
system can understand). This process is quite straightforward,
although the database designer still has some options at this
point, involving normalization. Normalization (see Resources) is a
formal process to quantify and measure the quality of a relational
model; as always, the tradeoff is theoretical quality versus
performance.</p><p>The quick-and-dirty algorithm for moving your data model from
the entity-relationship to the relational model is this:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Make sure every attribute of every entity is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>atomic</em></span>.</p></li><li><p>Make a table for every attribute of an entity which
can hold multiple values and define a join which ties these to the
associated entity.</p></li><li><p>Make tables for each entity, using as fields the
attributes you haven't dealt with yet. If an entity is involved in
an n:1 relationship, include the key of the record it is related to
as a foreign key.</p></li></ol></div><p>This is necessarily a simplified version of the process; it
does not deal with m:n relationships or some other details. For a
more complete discussion of data model conversion, see a textbook
on database theory.
</p><p>SQL code for the &ldquo;finished&rdquo; relational model can be found

capabilities we wish to grant users to access and update the data.
This is perhaps not as much of a problem in our database, but what
if we were designing a database of employees? It might cause great
discord in the office if everyone knew the salary of the guy who
spends every day surfing the Web and taking two-hour lunch breaks;
however, they should be able to access his name, department and
extension. Likewise, they shouldn't be able to change that
information unless they are the department secretary or
manager.</p><p>We do want <span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> protection on our
address book, so that you can type in your grandmother's e-mail
address with the peace of mind that a spammer can't get it just by
accessing your web server. We also don't want to bother the user
with implementation details like unique ID numbers on each
record&mdash;this should be a user-friendly address book. Therefore, we
will allow the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A user can retrieve records from her own address
book.</p></li><li><p>A user can insert and delete records in her own
address book.</p></li><li><p>The user will be shown only what she needs to
see.</p></li></ul></div><p>To this end, we create <span   class="emphasis"><em>views</em></span>. A view can
be just a few columns of a table or a few columns of a join. In
SQL, a view is defined with the <b  >CREATE VIEW</b>
statement, which creates a view from a <b  >SELECT</b>
statement. A view can be accessed just like a table, except you
can't perform inserts, updates or deletes on it. Some of the views
in our example application also use PostgreSQL functions to make
the final application programming easier, i.e., &ldquo;make a mailto URL
from this e-mail address&rdquo;.
</p><p>We also make note of the constraints which we cannot enforce
with views: for example, the consideration that one may view only
her own address book. We must implement these constraints in the
application program.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdd8580.0x11dfa80"></a>Implementation</h2></div></div><p>Implementation in PHP3 is quite straightforward; many things
in the example code speak for themselves, and others are
well-commented.</p><p>The source code for the example application is intended to be
more of a teaching tool than a finished product. It works well, but
you would certainly want to add features before making a
large-scale service from it. I have released it under the GNU GPL,
so feel free to modify my code and share your modifications with
others. This code is also on the FTP site shown above.</p><p><a href="3475s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
