    Database Administration got you down? Here's a tool to help
    you out.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b8580.0x16b0450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Orac is an open-source database
administration tool written in Perl/Tk. It was written primarily by
and for DBAs (database administrators). However, it will also be
very useful to developers and anyone else who wants to understand
more about how (and how well) their database is working.
</p><p>Orac provides much of the functionality that any DBA could
want. It includes scripts that help in managing physical database
files, users, database objects (such as tables, views, sequences,
etc.) and scripts that help tune the database and resolve
&ldquo;locking&rdquo; conflicts.</p><p>Orac builds on this collection of widely available SQL
scripts by providing a nice GUI and a logical organization of the
scripts. Orac is extensible, of course, in the sense that the
source code is readily available. Even better, though, Orac has an
easy method of adding support for more SQL scripts without editing
even a single line of code. So for those DBAs out there who already
have their favorite scripts, Orac is even more useful.</p><p>By the way, the Orac program was named after a supercomputer
in the BBC science fiction television series &ldquo;Blake's 7&rdquo; and in
no way takes its name from the Oracle database or the Oracle
Corporation. No affiliation with Oracle Corporation is intended or
implied.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b8580.0x16b0660"></a>Why Use Orac</h2></div></div><p>Many experienced DBAs manage databases almost exclusively
with command-line utilities. Oracle provides a number of tools such
as <span   class="bold"><b>sqlplus</b></span> for querying the
database, <span   class="bold"><b>svrmgrl</b></span> for startup and
shutdown of the database and
<span   class="bold"><b>sqlldr</b></span> for loading ASCII files.
Like the Oracle database, these simple command-line tools have
proven themselves solid, reliable and efficient.</p><p>Unfortunately, the same cannot always be said for the various
high-end database administration tools on the market. Configuration
and setup can be difficult. They are often slow, and at times it
may not be clear exactly what the tool is doing. Some commercial
DBA tools even require the use of a proprietary scripting language.
(By the way, I'm running Oracle 8.0.5, WordPerfect 8 and Orac
1.1.11 on a Pentium 75/64M, and it works just fine for single-user
experimentation.)</p><p>Orac provides an elegant way to capture and organize the
various scripts many DBAs need to do their job. It represents a
middle ground between having a bunch of ad-hoc scripts executed at
the command line and the complicated commercial tools.</p><p>There will always be a role for the commercial offerings, of
course, and you might eventually decide to purchase one. However,
the knowledge gained from having used a free tool like Orac in a
real-world setting can only be a benefit.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b8580.0x16b0978"></a>How Orac Works</h2></div></div><p>Orac is a Perl script that performs two basic tasks. It
retrieves information from the database and presents the
information to the user. A couple of important Perl modules are
used to do this work. First, DBI.pm is used to make the connection
to the database. Here is a simple code snippet that connects to the
Oracle database called ORA1 and gets a list of files that make up
the database.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use DBI;
$dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('ORA1','ADMIN','ADMINPASS','Oracle');
$sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare
   ("select file_name from dba_data_files");
$sth-&gt;execute;
while (@row = $sth-&gt;fetchrow()) {
   print "File Name: @row\n";
}
$sth-&gt;finish;
$dbh-&gt;disconnect;
exit;
</pre><p>Of course, Orac reads its SQL from a file instead of
hard-coding the statement into the Perl script, but the basic
principles remain the same.
</p><p><a href="3624l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>Once the needed data are in hand, it is fairly
straightforward to display them using the routines in the Tk
module. The script in Listing 1 is similar to the one above, but
instead of using a simple <span   class="bold"><b>print</b></span> to
send the information to standard output, it uses Tk to display the
results in the X Window System. Figure 1 shows the results from
running the Perl/Tk script.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3624f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Output Display of Listing 1
</p></div></div><p>Again, Orac uses Tk in a very flexible way. Orac loads its
menus from a text file after the program starts. To recap, Orac
loads both the SQL scripts it executes and the menus making up the
program from text files, after the program starts. Any idea where
this might lead? More on this later. Figure 2 shows how SQL gets
executed in Orac.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3624f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b8580.0x16b1058"></a>Orac in Action</h2></div></div><p>A number of common tasks are faced by DBAs, such as the
management of users, database performance, and of course, the
actual database files. We'll take a look at the last item, database
file management, to show how Orac can be used to make this task
easier.</p><p>A full explanation of Oracle storage concepts is beyond the
scope of this article. In short, though, a database is composed of
Tablespaces which can contain multiple DataFiles. A Tablespace is
composed of 1 to <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> DataFiles. Each of these
DataFiles contains the actual database information for tables,
views, stored procedures, etc. Typically, the data is segregated in
such a way that system-related information is stored in a different
Tablespace/DataFile than application-related data. Since DataFiles
are fixed in size at database creation time, DBAs must monitor the
available space and add or expand the DataFiles before they run out
of room. Newer versions of Oracle, by the way, have more
sophisticated space management techniques which alleviate some of
these problems.</p><p>Figure 3 shows a list of Tablespaces in the database and how
much free space remains. Orac has summed the total space for each
Tablespace. In other words, if a Tablespace is composed of three
DataFiles, then the total space available in the three files is
displayed. This brings up another great feature of Orac. Each
report includes a button called &ldquo;See SQL&rdquo; that displays the exact
query run to generate the report. If there is ever any question
about how a report was generated, you can get to the actual source
quickly and make the needed improvements or corrections.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3624f3.large.jpg"><img src="3624f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15b8580.0x16b1420"></a>Future Directions</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned earlier, Orac loads both the SQL and its user
interface from a text file at startup. Orac is perfectly capable of
loading a user interface and the related SQL for databases other
than Oracle. In fact, developers are hard at work on Informix, and
some work has also been done for Sybase. The Orac team would very
much like to see additional databases such as MySQL, mSQL and
PostgreSQL supported in the future, and we're actively looking for
volunteers to help out.</p><p>Another area developers are hard at work on is the
<span   class="bold"><b>dbish</b></span> (database interface shell).
This module provides the user with a way to enter ad hoc SQL into
the database. The initial module has already been coded and is
being tested now. By the time you read this, most of the bugs will
likely have been worked out.</p><p>While parts of Orac make use of Tk to draw some primitive
graphs, there is certainly room for improvement. In the near
future, Orac will make use of the functionality in the
<span   class="bold"><b>GD</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>GIFgraph</b></span> Perl modules to provide
better charting and graphing capabilities.</p><p>These are only a few of the areas where work is in progress.
The Orac team is actively soliciting feedback from anyone and
everyone who would like to make Orac a better program.</p><p><a href="3624s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
