top-quality, high-powered workstation from VA Linux Systems. In the
years since its 1993 inception, VA has earned a reputation for
producing rock-solid, dependable, performance-maximizing,
Linux-based workstations, servers and clusters. Once upon a time,
VA also built laptops and hopefully will do so again soon. VA even
has an entry-level machine, the SP, if you want to get a taste of
the &ldquo;good life&rdquo;. The XMP lives towards the upper range of
workstation machines and is indicative of a typical VA Linux
system. Most VA workstations come in the same tower, which is an
attractive, solid, heavy container with plenty of space and a
powerful fan. Beyond that, VA allows any type of customization you
want and provides an on-line system for piecing together whichever
components you like. Here's a description of the machine VA Linux
Systems sent to <i  >Linux Journal</i> for review.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1380580.0x1478b30"></a>Hardware</h2></div></div><p>The core of the system is an Intel MS440GX motherboard
featuring dual Pentium III Xeon 550MHz processors with 32KB of L1
cache and 512KB of L2 cache, 512MB of RAM and an 8.4GB SCSI drive
from Quantum. For comparison (to be somewhat up to date), current
VA workstations come with an Ms4406x or Tyan 1832 motherboard, are
available with Pentium III and Pentium III Xeon processors, and
typically have 512KB of L2 cache with the option of expanding to
2MB of L2 cache. Modern machines also have larger hard drives,
usually SCSI of 18.2GB or so and often 512MB or more of SDRAM. What
does this jargon mean?</p><p>L1 cache is &ldquo;level 1 cache&rdquo;, static RAM which sits on the
processor. When your processor asks for an instruction from memory,
it's very likely that the next instruction it will ask for is the
one right below the current instruction in memory. Likewise, when
one piece of data is loaded, the next piece of data the program
will want is probably sitting right below that. Instead of loading
the instructions individually, the processor caches 32KB or more on
the chip (usually 16KB for instructions and 16KB for data) so it
can get at the instructions and data immediately, instead of
loading them from RAM every single time. This dramatically improves
processor speed. The larger the L1 cache, the less loading from L2
cache and the faster the operation.</p><p>L2 cache is the &ldquo;level 2 cache&rdquo;, static (or sometimes
dynamic and static) RAM which sits between L1 and the memory at
large. Normal RAM is very slow (but cheap) compared to L2 cache
(which in turn is slower and cheaper than L1 cache), so the L2
cache acts as a buffer to store large chunks of memory to be
grabbed by the L1 cache, except L2 grabs 512KB or more at a time
(depending on the size of your L2 cache) compared to the usual 32KB
grabbed by L1. L2 is often considered the bottleneck in computer
performance, but VA helpfully recommends that you buy bigger cache
only if you do <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> many floating-point
operations and your application is noticeably limited by L2 cache
dependency. L1 cache loads instructions very quickly from L2 cache,
which loads instructions from RAM, so the system is a kind of
filtering pyramid to make sure the most needed instructions are
most readily accessible.</p><p>One might expect a multitasking OS like Linux, which
frequently grabs instructions and data from all over in memory, to
attenuate the benefits of cache, but the granulation of
multitasking systems is large enough that the effect is minimal,
especially on fast processors. (Granulation in this case is the
division of tasks into pieces, since multi-processing operating
systems actually execute many lines of a task before going on to
the next task in a queue, and on a 500MHz chip, many instructions
and much data can be covered in a few microseconds before moving to
the next task, hence the cache is definitely utilized.) Still, VA
Linux recommends increasing performance by adding more memory
(since we all know how well Linux takes advantage of extra memory)
or using multiple machines rather than overloading on cache, as the
most economical approach.</p><p>SDRAM, or synchronous dynamic RAM, is dynamic RAM which is
synchronized for the system bus speed (which is different from the
processor speed). That is, dynamic RAM loses its charge and
constantly requires refreshing, and if the RAM refresh is synced to
the speed of the processor's system bus, a noticeable performance
improvement can be made. VA uses SDRAM which is the most
fashionable at the moment. Although it doesn't translate into a
monstrous performance increase, especially because of the very high
speeds of L1 and L2 cache and the efficiency of this system, at the
very least it's not a weak link. The core of hardware performance
tends to be based around the CPU.</p><p>The motherboard of the VArStation contains two Intel Pentium
III Xeon 550MHz chips, though one is by no means compelled to
choose such a setup. At the moment, VA Linux offers a range of
processors starting with Intel's Celeron 400MHz and ranging up to
600MHz Pentium IIIs and 550MHz Xeons. Workstations have one or two
processors, servers are available with four, and clusters have
more. The Linux kernel can take advantage of two processors and is
said to do well with four, although it is rumored more might be
gratuitous and a bit less efficient than distributed
computing.</p><p>The difference between various chips can be confusing. Why is
a Pentium III better than a Pentium II, and what do terms like MMX
and Xeon mean? Chip design is actually quite complicated,
especially with complex instruction set chips (CISC) like the x86,
of which I'm not particularly fond. While there are issues of how a
chip manages caching of instructions (and microarchitecture
techniques such as multiple-branch prediction, data-flow analysis
and speculative execution), much of the performance increase in the
latest Pentiums and the like comes from raw speed and cache size,
and differences between chip models have to do with cache and
assembly-code instructions. For example, MMX means MultiMedia
Extensions, which is 57 extra multimedia instructions, eight new
registers, larger L1 cache and the ability to perform a single
instruction on multiple data, known as SIMD. Xeon is the futuristic
name given to the top of the Pentium line, designed for server
applications. Xeons are made for multiprocessing and use 100MHz
buses and 32KB of L1 cache via a 64-bit bus, with support for
larger addresses for dealing with big machines. Xeon 36-bit
addressing, for example, can access 64GB of physical memory, which
may be 62GB more than Linux kernels support. At the moment, VA
Linux uses Pentium IIIs for single-processor machines and Pentium
III Xeons for dual-processor workstations. Suffice it to say, III
is better than II on the whole, and Xeon is better where parallel
processing is concerned. The entry-level machine from VA, the
StartX SP, is based on the Celeron 400MHz, which has smaller L2
cache (128KB), although it is located directly on the chip for
faster results.</p><p>All in all, VA matches the right chips to the right machines
so that you get maximum performance for the price. For example, a
Celeron is good for a home computer, whereas a Xeon would be
inefficient overkill on a single-processor desktop machine. The
important thing about Linux box builders, especially VA, is that
they know how to optimize systems. VA is quite knowledgeable and
helpful in recommending how to get the best performance for the
dollar, and there really is an advantage to getting a system that's
built especially for Linux machines.</p><p>Everything else on the VA boxes is top of the line, from SCSI
drives to Ethernet cards to modems. There are no weak links in VA
boxes. My only complaint is that the sound cards are not
spectacular (for example, I would really like digital I/O), but
Linux has a way to go as far as sound support. Video, on the other
hand, is top quality and utilizes the latest Matrox cards. Of
course, VA Linux computers come optimally preconfigured for the
monitors VA sells. The keyboard is nice and heavy, although it has
three stupid Windows keys. The mouse is a Logitech (for a
right-hander, I might add). You don't have to worry about getting
cheap components on a VA system. I asked VA about this. &ldquo;We want
overall quality to be high; we will not sacrifice quality to get
the world's cheapest prices,&rdquo; I was told. As for support, VA has
24x7 support staff, but the manual is so thorough you probably
won't need support. The manual is actually a very large, thick,
technical-looking collection of hardware data for everything in the
machine. In addition, VA included Que's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Using
Linux</em></span> book, SuSE's Linux Office Suite 99, a rescue disk,
a couple of CD-ROMs for the video card and motherboard, and a
CD-ROM of the OS. The system software for VA Linux workstations is
the VA Linux OS.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1380580.0x1478fa8"></a>Software</h2></div></div><p>VA Linux OS 6.0 is actually a Red Hat-based CD-ROM which is
customized for VA machines and their hardware. Although the systems
come pre-installed, installation is quite easy and all one has to
do is select the VA Workstation option from the package selection
menu to get the VA wares. Obviously, you don't have to enter your
hardware configurations, since either Red Hat is probing
successfully or VA made sure the installer already knows.</p><p>VA Linux OS 6.0 differs from Red Hat in a number of ways, and
in my mind, is an improvement. For one thing, VA's installation
uses KDE instead of the other window managers, and regardless of
how one feels morally about the GNOME vs. KDE debate (libQt still
isn't truly free), KDE is by most accounts further developed at
this point and does support several languages. I especially liked
VA's account of why KDE was chosen:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The primary reasons were stability and
consistency of interface. This is not a judgment against GNOME or
for KDE, but merely a decision based on what is best for the novice
user. It's our belief most advanced users will already have a
preferred environment, which would not be GNOME or KDE in any
case.</p></blockquote></div><p>VA's variant of Red Hat looks quite nice; in fact, it's my
favorite of all Red Hat variants including Red Hat itself. As far
as became apparent to me, it's just a highly configured setup with
a custom kernel (2.2.7-1.15smp) for the VA box. Nevertheless, the
desktop looks very nice by default with a futuristic VA background
and cool blue borders and buttons that look rather in tune with the
whole quest to be &ldquo;space age&rdquo;, which comes with this millennium
business.
</p><p>Despite everything VA has going for it, a few small problems
exist in the VA OS 6.0. Some kernel modules are compiled with an
earlier kernel and require <b  >insmod -f</b> to force
them to load, which can lead to unresolved symbols. If you load the
modules in the right sequence, you can usually get around this,
although after I reinstalled the OS (the machine shipped with VA
Linux OS 5.2) the sound modules remained dysfunctional without a
kernel recompile. So, it seems to me that the weakest link in VA
systems is audio. Nevertheless, it's not so hard to recompile a
kernel for sound support, and these are exceedingly fast computers
so kernel compilation goes quickly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1380580.0x14792c0"></a>Benchmarks</h2></div></div><p>The <i  >Linux Journal</i> benchmarks are still
genuine vaporware, but as soon as they are developed, we'll print
the results for this excellent VArStation. Computer systems are
changing, moving from a single processor to multiple processors,
supporting larger hard drives and much more RAM, and are designed
for efficiency gains in areas often ignored by conventional
benchmarks. In addition, greater customization of hardware can take
the load off the CPU, while kernels are becoming more and more
clever. As computers are whole systems rather than individual chips
and pieces, the issue is not how well one of the processors
performs a loop of floating-point operations, sets all the bits in
memory, or scores on a bogomips test (547.23 and 545.59 for the
processors on this particular VArStation), but how well the system
as a whole performs. Overall system performance is dependent on
many things, especially the operating system itself and how well it
can manage various tasks and take advantage of hardware. Newer
Linux kernels perform better.</p><p>Speaking of kernels, the most important activity of any Linux
user is recompiling the kernel. Well, maybe not, when you've
already got an ideal kernel as on a VA box, but it's often the
biggest compilation many of us make. On a VArStation running
<span   class="bold"><b>egcs</b></span> 2.91.66, my typically
oversized kernel compiled with <b  >make bzImage</b> in
less than two minutes, with <b  >make&nbsp;modules</b>
requiring only three. <b  >make modules_install</b> took
two seconds and <b  >bzlilo</b> ran in eleven. Although
everyone's kernels are different, mine are usually too big, so
yours would probably take even less time.</p><p>The machine is a true joy to use on a daily basis. There are
no lags, no waiting, and not even Netscape manages to go awry. I
can do neat things like play two chess engines against each other,
each on a different processor&mdash;that makes for roughly 200,000
positions per second per processor. Compiling
<span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span> is a joke&mdash;it takes more time to type
<b  >tar -xzf</b>, <b  >cd</b> and
<b  >./configure; make</b>. In fact, although fast
machines are nice as servers, the amazing compilation speed would
probably save much time and money for software development firms,
not to mention improve the quality of software, as one can make far
more trials in a given amount of time. (Well, I for one am a
practicioner of the trial-and-error approach to programming.)
Besides, it boosts morale to have fast computers.</p><p>Table 1 shows the results of some common Linux benchmarks,
for those interested. Keep in mind, however, that the BYTEmark
tests check only a single processor, so practically speaking, the
results should be doubled.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1380580.0x1479840"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>The future of VA Linux is a subject of optimistic
speculation. VA seems to have adopted Sun's commitment to
top-quality hardware with Dell's business model and is already the
most famous exclusively Linux systems provider. After the Red Hat
episode, it seems like everyone hopes to get in on the next Linux
IPO, and rumors have been circulating about VA. Finances aside, the
technology that will emerge from the organization formerly known as
VA Research is bound to be impressive. Already some big names have
gone to VA, the most prominent being Theodore T'so, Leonard
Zubkoff, the Enlightenment team of Mandrake (Geoff Harrison) and
Raster (Carsten Haitzler), Nettwerk (San Mehat), the nickname-less
Michael Jennings, as well as Mark Vojkovich of XF86 fame, H.J. Lu
of GNU/Bintools and NFS, and many others who deserve more mention
than they receive.</p><p>What would you need brain power like that for? Try porting
the Linux kernel to the new 64-bit Merced chip as part of the
Trillion project, which is apparently going much smoother than
Microsoft's port of Win32. VA is also developing VACM (a cluster
manager to be released under the GPL), the Enlightenment Window
Manager, Perl bindings for GTK, the Linux kernel (in areas such as
file systems, RAID, and large memory, Ethernet, and file system
support), XFree86 and card drivers (Matrox in particular), and
apparently some work on glibc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1380580.0x14799a0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>I have had the pleasure of using this machine for a couple
months now, and it has done all sorts of things such as serving
web-based e-mail, web-site hosting, code development, graphics
programming, audio work and all the usual network things, as well
as running all sorts of distributions. (You're not stuck with Red
Hat, by the way, just copy the config files and install whichever
distribution you like.) Any software I tested in the last few
months was tested on the VAr. Modern software is made for slower,
single-processor machines&mdash;everything runs better on the
VArStation. Compilation times are short, graphic manipulation is
instantaneous and almost never leaves tracers or flickers. The
hardware stands up to everything. I even told the machine that it's
the year 2000 right now, and everything still works&mdash;such a
surprise! As far as improvements, I would like to see better audio
support and digital flatscreen LCD monitors. Also, the keyboards
feel nice, but have Windows keys and that's irritating. On a
sillier note, the color scheme is fine and all, but I'd prefer
something sinister like black. Nevertheless, whatever color it is
and however many keys it has, it is still the fastest, most stable
computer I have ever used.</p></div></div>
