    The authors present a freely available tool for monitoring
    enterprise systems through simplicity toward complexity.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xafa580.0xbf2608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Event management is a backbone of every
enterprise management system, since it is the flow of events that
describes various activities in the enterprise. By coordinating or
acting on those events, enterprise starts being managed.
</p><p>One of us, Jarra, has been contracting to a large computer
company that was deploying Unicenter TNG for monitoring outsourced
systems. Most of the systems were UNIX-based. Unicenter TNG agents,
as is well known, are SNMP-based. After a considerable amount of
time was spent tweaking the agents to come close to what he had
decided to monitor and how to go about it, he arrived at the
following conclusions:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SNMP results in thick agents that are inflexible
for dynamically changing environments.</p></li><li><p>SNMP OIDs (Object IDentifiers) are not suitable for
quick deployment of new resource hierarchies.</p></li><li><p>Without access to the source code, which is typical
of most commercial software, there is no way to extend the
functionality of existing agents.</p></li><li><p>The provided event management language is too
restrictive and just another new language to learn.</p></li><li><p>Linux is a superior management platform to Windows
NT, especially in terms of available tools and utilities.</p></li><li><p>The event console design determines the efficiency
of the whole system.</p></li></ul></div><p>We began thinking about how to accomplish system monitoring
with ultra-thin clients, while maintaining their status at the
event manager. That was when we thought of using a principal
parameter we coined &ldquo;time-to-live&rdquo;. At that very moment, EMU
(Event Management Utility) was born. Each event message sent to EMU
must have time-to-live set. It determines how long the message is
kept in the database before it is deleted. If time-to-live is
slightly more than the polling interval, the message will stay in
the database until we stop resending it. In other words, the
message will be in the database for the duration of an alarm only.
</p><p>EMU is a comprehensive event management system with no
limitations on what it can do for you. It harnesses the full power
of Linux/UNIX utilities and scripting languages. Remember, software
is here for us, and not the other way around.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xafa580.0xbf2c90"></a>Event Management System Background</h2></div></div><p>Event management systems usually consist of four components:
monitoring manager, monitoring agents, event manager and event
console.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xafa580.0xbf2d98"></a>Monitoring Manager and Agents</h2></div></div><p>Monitoring agents typically poll a resource, such as a file
system, at regular intervals in order to track its status changes.
These changes are communicated to the manager. The manager
processes incoming resource status changes and either forwards them
to the event manager or updates the business rules it maintains.
The monitoring manager can poll for resource status information as
well.</p><p>Resources may be of any kind, such as file systems,
processes, disk, swap, applications or logged-in users.</p><p>Some monitoring agents, such as Unicenter TNG, are built
around SNMP. In those systems, agents use traps to notify
monitoring managers of status changes. Traps are sent using the UDP
protocol, hence their delivery is not guaranteed. This drawback has
to be made up for by regular polling by the manager, thereby
collecting resource status independent of traps.</p><p>SNMP agents maintain status information of each resource they
monitor. This information is typically maintained by the monitoring
manager as well. Both agents and the manager keep resource status
stored in a database. This is a key design feature of SNMP-based
monitoring. Let us consider a file system example. If a threshold
is set at 90%, an alarm is raised on exceeding this threshold. The
status of the resource is changed to critical. It must stay in the
critical state until the file system is cleaned up. Then the status
is changed back to normal.</p><p>A need to maintain resource status and resource hierarchy
results in rather complex SNMP agent coding. As a result, it is not
trivial to extend existing agents. Furthermore, C coding skills and
access to the source code are necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xafa580.0xbf3000"></a>Event Manager and Console</h2></div></div><p>The monitoring agent forwards events to the event manager,
which usually performs some kind of event processing, such as
matching messages against predefined strings and triggering an
action in case of a match. Unicenter TNG provides a language for
matching messages and taking action on them. The language is
extremely simple, and thus inadequate for performing more complex
correlations and actions.</p><p>The event console is the front end for administration staff.
It allows us to &ldquo;view&rdquo; events. Its design determines its
usability and efficiency. Events representing one alarm should be
displayed as one event, rather than getting a separate visible
event at each poll. To keep track of events easily, one strives to
keep their display representations to a minimum. Otherwise, they
scroll out of view before IT staff can take note of them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xafa580.0xbf3160"></a>Problems with Enterprise Management
Offerings</h2></div></div><p>There are a few major players in the enterprise management
arena, most notably Tivoli, BMC and Unicenter TNG. All of these
strive to win support from other software and hardware vendors for
their APIs. At the end of the day, they try hard to sell all the
enterprise management components from their offerings. We find this
disadvantageous to the end customer. Enterprise management is about
using the best breed of products, from independent vendors, which
can be easily integrated. This integration should be accomplished
by either a single standard API or a command-line and script
interface. Being UNIX types, weprefer a command-line interface and
scripts. That way, we can intercept messages passed between
enterprise management components. If a new product needs to be
integrated, it can literally be plugged in.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xafa580.0xbf3268"></a>EMU Background</h2></div></div><p>EMU is a flexible and integration-ready event management tool
developed under Linux. It consists of a manager and agents. In
fact, it integrates monitoring and event manager into one program.
Agents are very simple scripts invoked by
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>. These scripts are run at
regular intervals, perhaps every five minutes. Each run scans the
resources it monitors, comparing their thresholds against a
configuration file. If a threshold is exceeded, a message is sent
to the manager.</p><p>EMU employs time-to-live, which proved to be a simple way of
maintaining resource status across agent polls. Let us suppose an
agent that runs every five minutes found a resource problem. At
each poll, it will send an alarm message to the manager. In this
case, time-to-live will be set to slightly more than five minutes
at 330 seconds. The manager will maintain the first message sent
and its updates. If no update is received within the 330 seconds
time-to-live of a particular message, the message is deleted and
the problem is assumed to have been fixed. This simple approach
allows us to write simple agents, preferably scripts, that scan a
monitored resource and send their findings on each poll. The
manager takes care of the rest. In fact, thanks to EMU, agents
consisting of a few lines of code can monitor a very complex
resource.</p><p>ASCII and Tcl/Tk interfaces to EMU are available. They
represent a console for viewing events. The console displays all
the necessary information to keep IT staff up to date. Each event
is uniquely represented by a resource ID, which consists of the
monitored system host name and object ID. All updates from the same
resource ID are treated as one displayable event, while all the
individual updates are stored in an event log file. If no updates
for a resource ID have been received within an agent-specific
time-to-live, the event message is removed from the console.</p><p>Examples of resource IDs are dumbo.company.com.au:/usr/local,
tcc2345:sendmail and brk23:tz45. The first field before the colon
designates a host name; the second field is a unique resource name.
Two resources on a single system must not have the same resource
ID, because EMU would treat them as the same resource.</p><p>The input interface to the manager is
<span   class="bold"><b>emsg</b></span>, a small utility that uses
TCP sockets to send messages to the manager. While the manager is
written in Perl, emsg is written in C to facilitate its easy
deployment on any monitored platform. In fact, Jarra is currently
contracting to a company to install emsg on Linux, Compaq Tru64
UNIX, Solaris, AIX, IRIX, Sinix, Ultrix and VMS.</p><p>The integration interface is taken to the extreme by invoking
input, delete and output scripts. Depending on the type of message,
these scripts are issued on receipt of the message, on its removal
or on its processing. All the message attributes are passed to the
script as environment variables. In this way, we have achieved
integration with Unicenter TNG event management. The TNG
console-held area is, in fact, an exact image of the EMU console,
thus making it much more usable and efficient.</p><p>EMU was built with distributed processing in mind. Multiple
managers can run on a single or several systems, thus forming a
hierarchy reflecting a company's need. Through the truly open
architecture of EMU, it is easy to synchronize multiple managers,
build fail-over configurations or extend their
functionality.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xafa580.0xbf3630"></a>Installation and Configuration</h2></div></div><p>EMU consists of a manager
(<span   class="bold"><b>gemu</b></span>), cleaner
(<span   class="bold"><b>gemucleaner</b></span>), emsg agent
(<span   class="bold"><b>emsg1</b></span>) and console/browser
(<span   class="bold"><b>eb</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>xeb</b></span>). The manager and cleaner must
run on the same node. The cleaner process manages message
expirations. In order to provide flexibility, only one option is
passed to gemu, gemucleaner and eb&mdash;the port number the particular
server is running on. Both gemucleaner and eb use emsg to send
delete messages to EMU.</p><p>A configuration file used by gemu, gemucleaner and eb is
stored in /usr/local/emu/conf/<span   class="emphasis"><em>port#</em></span>.cfg. The
configuration file describes the location of the EMU database
(DBM-based), location of log files, scan interval for gemucleaner,
etc. Each server will access its own configuration file based on
the port number. If it suits your site, put the database under
/usr/local/emu/<span   class="emphasis"><em>port#</em></span>/db. Each port/server will
have log files and action scripts stored under
/usr/local/emu/<span   class="emphasis"><em>port#</em></span> in sub-directories named
logs and actions. The binaries/scripts are shared and stored in
/usr/local/emu/bin.</p><p>One option in the configuration file is the location of emsg.
If emsg, compiled for the individual platforms on your site, is
stored in the /usr/local/emu/EMSG directory, you are ready to run
eb (EMU browser/console) locally on your workstation. This is
accomplished by exporting as read-only the /usr/local/emu
directory. This directory will be mounted on the workstation as
/usr/local/emu. By creating a symbolic link /usr/local/bin/emsg
that points to
/usr/local/emu/EMSG/emsg.<span   class="emphasis"><em>platform</em></span> and putting
/usr/local/emu/bin in your search path, eb will run locally while
displaying event messages from the server.</p><p>Depending on what actions EMU is configured to handle, the
user ID it is running under can be either &ldquo;emu&rdquo; or
&ldquo;root&rdquo;.</p><p>For the input, delete and output scripts, message attributes
(e.g., host name, message text) are passed as environment
variables. These can easily be used to trigger actions. It is a
good idea to have one launcher script that, depending on message
attributes, calls other, task-specific scripts. As a result, the
workload imposed on the manager system will be reduced. The output
script can be used to selectively forward messages to either a
higher-level EMU or a third-party system. The input script may be
used as a barrier to stop certain messages from processing based on
a calendar. If this script returns a value greater than 0, the
message is discarded. The delete message can be used for
synchronization with a third-party system.</p><p>Time to live can be specified as seconds, minutes, hours or a
fixed time in the form of HH:MM. A time-to-live of
<b  >-1</b> stands for infinity, and the associated
message will be displayed in reverse video (by eb) and the cleaner
will not expire it. The only way to put the message away is with a
delete command on the console. This allows a batch job or backup
failures to wait until they are acknowledged. Time-to-live set to
<b  >0</b> is used with so-called pass-through messages.
They are not stored in the EMU database (they are recorded in the
log file), but are intended to trigger an action.</p><p><a href="3466f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1. ASCII-Based EMU Message
Browser</a></p><p>The eb console provides a basic display of messages. A new
message is displayed in bold to draw our attention. A message can
be deleted/acknowledged or annotated. Message annotations appear
indented under each message. They serve the purpose of notifying
others about details, such as a work request that has been logged.
The message time shown on the console was the local time on the
system that sent the first message. It helps identify when a
problem occurred.</p><p><a href="3466f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2. GUI-Based EMU Message
Browser</a></p><p>EMU maintains a separate log file for each day. This log file
stores all received messages, including their attributes, e.g. host
name, message text and class. Message attributes are delimited with
a vertical bar to allow for easy processing in scripts or uploading
spreadsheets.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xafa580.0xfec118"></a>Classes</h2></div></div><p>The class option of emsg can be used in many powerful ways.
When monitoring systems, it is best used for identifying a class
hierarchy to the monitored resource; for example, /LINUX/PRO to
designate a process subsystem or /LINUX/FS to designate a file
system subsystem. In a way, it is similar to the SNMP OIDs;
however, emsg class is much more flexible and can be created
immediately as a need arises. Companies should develop a standard
document detailing the classes format to be used. It is likely to
reflect their business, resource and escalation hierarchies.</p><p>In a pure SNMP environment, a message arrives with an OID
number that many people find cryptic and impractical. With the use
of classes, the information is not only easy to read, but also
lends itself to message filtering, forwarding, actioning, etc. For
example, database messages may have a class set to /IT/ORACLE. On
receipt of such a message, the DBA may be paged to attend to the
problem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xafa580.0xfec278"></a>Agents</h2></div></div><p>In this section, a simple example agent for file system
monitoring is demonstrated. Considerations are made of important
aspects of the system along with tradeoffs. To make the example
simple, the configuration file used will ignore minimal disk space
limits for each file system. The code for this agent is shown in
Listing 1.</p><p><a href="3466l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>Once a resource is selected, we have to determine whether
there is a periodicity in the way the resource can be monitored.
For periodic monitoring, we need to know how frequently the
resource should be monitored. The shorter the interval, the more
resource-intensive the agent. However, by selecting too large an
interval, we may miss an alarm in its early stage. For our file
system agent, we will select a five-minute interval.</p><p>Next, time-to-live needs to be established. Given the poll
interval of five minutes, we will select a time-to-live of six
minutes. Remember, this must always be larger than the poll
interval to keep display of events &ldquo;continuous&rdquo;. To achieve
regular polling, the agent will be running from cron.</p><p>Once you have the agent, all that needs to be done is
deciding which user it will run under and create a cron job for
submissions in five-minute intervals. In fact, the simple code in
Listing 1 is a full-blown agent for monitoring file systems with a
10% alarm limit.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xafa580.0xfec538"></a>Actions</h2></div></div><p>Now, let us put together a simple output action script. We
are going to use EMU for monitoring a flow of events. To accomplish
this, a directory called events is created. This directory stores
files with names reflecting event names. If a file exists, it means
the event it describes is active. Once the file is removed, the
event has finished. Consider a scenario where a backup of
SAP_ORACLE must complete by 6 AM. If a backup event file is found
after 6 AM, it indicates the backup is running overtime or the
backup script crashed without an opportunity to remove the
file.</p><p>The SAP_ORACLE backup script reads as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/ksh
emsg -n emuserver -p 2345 -t 0 -s 3 -w
icecream\
-c ADD_EVENT -m SAP_ORACLE_BACKUP
# start backup
.
.
.
# backup finished
emsg -n emuserver -p 2345 -t 0 -s 3 -w
icecream\
-c DEL_EVENT -m SAP_ORACLE_BACKUP
</pre><p>The output action script that creates or removes the event
file will look as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ "$E_CLASS" = "ADD_EVENT" ];then
        touch /usr/local/emu/events/$E_MSG
fi
if [ "$E_CLASS" = "DEL_EVENT" ];then
        rm /usr/local/emu/events/$E_MSG
fi
</pre>


Another example is an input action script that stops messages from
a node called dumbo, even though the EMU password is correct. It is
necessary to mention an environment variable called
<b  >E_RHOST</b>. In order to facilitate forwarding of
messages from EMU to EMU, emsg has an <b  >-h</b> option
for changing the name of the host from which the message arrived.
This message attribute is stored in <b  >E_HOST</b>.
However, <b  >E_RHOST</b> stores the true node name from
which the message arrived. The input action script is as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ "$E_RHOST" = "dumbo" ];then
        exit 1
else
        exit 0
fi
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xafa580.0xfec958"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Event management and resource monitoring is a complex
subject, so we tried to touch on only the most important aspects of
it. We believe by providing a free tool, enterprise event
management will become a must on most sites. Linux is the best
platform for EMU, since to take full advantage of its capabilities,
an open and tools-rich environment is necessary. Check our web site
