And they asked me how I did it, and I gave 'em the Scripture
text, `You keep your light so shining a little in front o' the
next!' They copied all they could follow, but they couldn't
copy my mind, And I left 'em sweating and stealing a year and a

==Rudyard Kipling
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13b6348"></a></h2></div></div><p>In September, I suggested that the real
Linux &ldquo;threat&rdquo;&mdash;the true course of World Domination&mdash;was not an
epic battle between Linux and Windows, but the quiet transformation
of the whole software industry from one known mostly for its
vendors to one known mostly for its builders.</p><p>Since then, usage for the verb <span   class="emphasis"><em>build</em></span> and
the noun <span   class="emphasis"><em>builder</em></span> has shot up. True, web work
has always had its construction and real estate metaphors: we
<span   class="emphasis"><em>build</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>develop</em></span> a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>site</em></span> with an <span   class="emphasis"><em>address</em></span> or a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>location</em></span>. But, to borrow another real estate
metaphor, the ground is beginning to swell. In fact, it feels like
there might be a volcano under there.</p><p>One harbinger is Borland (known less well these days as
Inprise, or Borland/Inprise, or something like that). The company
already had Builder-branded tools (J Builder, C++ Builder) when it
detected the obvious fact that the server side of the Web was being
built by a huge and growing number of Linux hackers. So the Borland
folks thought they'd do a little research. &ldquo;Would Linux developers
like some Borland tools for Linux?&rdquo;, they asked on a half-dozen
popular Linux-related web sites. The answer was a word balloon big
enough to fill the sky. Twenty-four thousand programmers spoke with
one voice, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Significantly, most of those speaking called
Windows their current development platform. (Read more about it in
this month's &ldquo;upFRONT&rdquo; section.)</p><p>Even CNET's Builder.com site and Builder.com.live! trade
show, for all their Windows defaults (they still ghetto Linux
discussions into a &ldquo;Project Heresy&rdquo; section) can't ignore
developments that are manifest in their own discussion groups:
there are more than a thousand posts, talking about the two most
recent Red Hat versions.</p><p>The real magma in this volcano is demand. Inprise/Borland CEO
Dale Fuller says:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The whole business world is moving to the Net.
The new skyline of business is being built on the Web. And
constructing it will take an enormous amount of work. Lots of
builders will need lots of tools and construction materials, not to
mention architectural blueprints. That's our business, and we think
it's a good one to be in.</p></blockquote></div><p>Look at the numbers. According to International Data Corp.,
businesses bought $80.4 billion US worth of goods and services over
the Web in 1999, and consumers spent another $31 billion US. IDC
expects those numbers to reach $1.1 trillion US and $177.7 billion
US by 2003&mdash;increases of 1,418% and 574%, respectively. That's in
cash money&mdash;for real stuff. Remember how the big revenue model for
the Web was going to be advertising? Well, that will explode too,
but to &ldquo;just&rdquo; $33 billion US in 2003, IDC says.
</p><p>Now think about the infrastructure involved here.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Huge</em></span> doesn't cover it. Those numbers are just
for e-commerce. What's it going to take to build out the
infrastructure behind all that? We know it'll take two things for
sure: Linux and Apache&mdash;two well-proven building materials. Of
course, Windows 2000 will also be involved. There are just too many
people already constructing this new skyline with Microsoft tools
and building materials. The difference is that the builders
themselves help improve Linux, Apache and other open-source
products. They can't do the same for Microsoft.</p><p>One developer put it to me this way:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>When I'm building a skyscraper, I want to know
there's rebar in the concrete. With Linux, I know. With Microsoft,
I don't. In fact, NT's memory leaks prove to me there isn't rebar
in there. Since I have to work with NT for political reasons, I
just cope with it. But I know if we could see the source, we could
probably fix the problem pretty fast.</p></blockquote></div><p>It's a subtle thing, but I feel the center of gravity in the
software industry starting to shift from platforms and applications
to tools and building materials. Or, as Eric Raymond likes to put
it, from sale value to use value. The irony is, use value helps
make a bigger overall industry.
</p><p>So the next question is: If the software industry is going to
turn into another construction industry, what becomes of Microsoft?
To help find that answer, let's ask: who is the Microsoft of the
construction industry?</p><p>Is it Home Depot? With more than $8 billion US in 1999 sales,
Home Depot is the &ldquo;big box&rdquo; store for the do-it-yourself
business, and a &ldquo;category killer&rdquo; for hardware stores. But
technically, it's a retail business.</p><p>The biggest home builder in the U.S. is Centex, with more
than $5 billion US in 1998 sales. Behind Centex are Pulte and
Kauffman &amp; Broad, both in the $2.5 billion US range. But none
of those companies are household names. Equally unfamiliar is
Japan's Shimizu, which outweighs all three American leaders. Even
less memorable (and pronounceable) is ABB Asea Brown Boveri of
Switzerland, which had nearly $31 billion US in 1998 sales. That's
not only bigger than all those other construction companies, but
far ahead of Microsoft, which had less than $20 billion US in the
same year.</p><p>The big difference, of course, is that Microsoft's
earnings&mdash;its profits&mdash;approached $8 billion US, while ABB Asea
Brown Boveri barely passed $1.3 billion US. At almost 97%,
Microsoft's gross profit margin was well ahead of the industry
average of 82%, and more than double the average for the eight
thousand members of the New York Stock Exchange. Its net profit
margin (39.4%) also more than doubled its own industry (15.8%) and
was more than seven times larger than the average for all of Wall
Street (5.8%).</p><p>As I write this, Microsoft has a market value of around half
a trillion dollars. Compare that to General Motors, which is number
one on the Fortune 500 in 1998 sales of more than $161 billion US,
but which earned less than $3 billion US in the same year and
currently has a market value of less than $50 billion US. Microsoft
is simply the largest, most profitable and most durable member of
the world's most profitable major industry.</p><p>Let's put this in perspective. The total worldwide packaged
software market&mdash;Microsoft's category&mdash;was $135 billion US in 1998,
and growing at a 13.6% rate. But the worldwide outsourcing services
market was nearly as big: $100 billion US in 1998 and growing at
about the same rate. The computer services industry was $90 billion
US in 1997. And we're not even touching a raft of other hefty
categories: enterprise resource planning, security, database
management, transaction systems and so on.</p><p>Meanwhile, the construction industry in the U.S. alone is
$619 billion US. Yet the leading builder, Centex, accounts for less
than 1% of the whole industry. That's because most of the industry
is local. &ldquo;Compared to the globalization driving much of the
construction industry, the localized nature of home building seems
almost quaint. Small local contractors still account for
four-fifths of all domestic residential construction&rdquo;, writes
Hoovers (http://www.hoovers.com/). And that's just counting the
current job-holders. The do-it-yourself business is also huge, as
the success of Home Depot shows.</p><p>And that brings us back to what's really going on.</p><p>Linux and other open-source products&mdash;along with constantly
improving commercial tools from the likes of Borland/Inprise&mdash;are
equipping software architects, developers and solution builders to
take over the whole software business. If it follows the lead of
the construction business, the result will be a much bigger pie for
everybody to split, including Microsoft.</p><p>I think we'll see the software industry start to explode on
the same curve, and on the same scale as the last &ldquo;free&rdquo;
development everybody but the hackers ignored&mdash;the Internet.</p></div></div>
