the Microsoft challenge to the cracker community to break a Win2K
box with IIS. The part I found the most hilarious was Microsoft's
attempt to force these script kiddies to abide by some rules while
they performed beta security testing. I guess Microsoft won't make
that mistake again (at least not until Windows 2010). Do we need to
take a look at some security software, and a program or two to help
with the logs? From watching the LinuxPPC challenge, Linux looked
like a state-of-the-art Fort Knox compared to Microsoft. Lest we
get too cocky, remember that most distributions aren't this secure
out of the box. LinuxPPC had most services turned off.

Packet:<a href="http://redirect.to/mg" target="_self">http://redirect.to/mg/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Send Packet</b></span> will allow root
to send TCP, UDP or ICMP packets on the network with any number of
items set: source address, destination address, window size, TTL,
ICMP code, etc. Wonder how your firewall will react to certain
packets? Turn on logging and send a packet, then check the results.
This should not be used by anyone except root for obvious reasons.
It requires glibc.</p><p>adzapper:<a href="http://www.halcyon.com/adamf/adzapper" target="_self">http://www.halcyon.com/adamf/adzapper/</a></p><p>Does anyone out there remember Slashdot without the banners?
Would you like to go back? The
<span   class="bold"><b>adzapper</b></span> is a small, configurable
&ldquo;proxy&rdquo; that runs on your local machine (or any machine) to cover
up those gaudy ads. Take back control of your content. I have been
using this for a few days and will most likely keep running it.
Sufficient &ldquo;zaplets&rdquo; (small files that define URLs to filter out)
exist to clean up most sites, and you can always add your own. It
requires Python.</p><p>birthday:<a href="http://user.bene-online.de/mschmid" target="_self">http://user.bene-online.de/mschmid/</a></p><p>(Warning: this paragraph is not Y2K compliant; saving it on
your computer system could result in your cows going dry and not
giving milk&mdash;you have been warned.) Here is a simple little
reminder program. Just create your ~/.birthday file as instructed
by the documentation, put the
<span   class="bold"><b>birthday</b></span> command in your startup
file and get a message reminding you about upcoming birthdays. I
suppose as long as your birthdays are Y2K compliant, the output
will be, too. (Just don't complain to me if it doesn't remind you
of anything on 31 Feb 00.) The only glitch I noticed was it didn't
return the xterm back to its original foreground color, but left it
white instead. It is difficult to read the text on a white xterm
background. It requires glibc.</p><p>BASS:<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/data/tools/network/bass-1.0.7.tar.gz" target="_self">www.securityfocus.com/data/tools/network/bass-1.0.7.tar.gz</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>BASS</b></span> (no home page) is a
scanner to run from your local system. It has various features,
including a &ldquo;coward&rdquo; mode. When invoked in this coward mode, it
tries to hide by going to sleep when someone logs in. A normal
process listing (<b  >ps&nbsp;aux</b>) shows a blank in
the &ldquo;Command&rdquo; column. However, a <b  >ps&nbsp;auxc</b>
or use of gps (see below) shows up the command just fine. Only root
can perform certain functions, but it is unclear to me what any
user other than root would be doing running this program. It
requires glibc.</p><p>colortail:<a href="http://www.student.hk-r.se/~pt98jan/colortail.html" target="_self">www.student.hk-r.se/~pt98jan/colortail.html</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>colortail</b></span> allows you to view
files with colors for designated text. The program comes with
several configuration files for looking at log files, the very
thing I had in mind when I downloaded it. It makes scanning log
files much easier. The provided config files look much better on
the black console background than on a white xterm background, but
that problem can be easily fixed if necessary. It requires
libstdc++, libm and glibc.</p><p>dhcpxd:<a href="http://www.dhcpxd.dhs.org:50080" target="_self">http://www.dhcpxd.dhs.org:50080/</a></p><p>For those who use <span   class="bold"><b>dhcpcd</b></span>
often, this client is great.
<span   class="bold"><b>dhcpxd</b></span> has more features than
dhcpcd, including support for aliasing. Several of my clients run
dhcpcd, so I can just plug in my laptop, get an IP address for
eth0:1, and get to work. You do need aliasing support compiled into
the kernel, but that is small potatoes. It requires libstdc++, libm
and glibc.</p><p>gps:<a href="http://www.dcc.unicamp.br/~guazzibe/gPS" target="_self">http://www.dcc.unicamp.br/~guazzibe/gPS/</a></p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>gps</b></span> package does what
many <span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span> packages do&mdash;shows you a
list of processes. What makes this program a standout is that the
author logically (in my opinion) arranged the output in an order
more aligned to how people would use the columns: PID, command,
owner, state, CPU%, Size, RSS, Nice, Priority and date/time of
Start. For me, this beats the standard layout where the two things
I need most (PID and command) are on opposite sides of the table.
Buttons for SIGHUP and SIGKILL (but not SIGTERM) are included. It
lacks a way to specify columns and their display order. I look
forward to grabbing a newer copy of this software soon. It requires
libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl, libXext, libX11,
libstdc++, libm and glibc.</p><p>qutar:<a href="http://home.sol.no/~geirerni/qutar" target="_self">http://home.sol.no/~geirerni/qutar/</a></p><p><span   class="bold"><b>qutar</b></span> is a Qt interface to
run tar and gzip, bzip2 or zip. It has a nice uncluttered feel. It
is still early in development, but shows signs of being a
well-thought-out program. About the only minor annoyance is when
you do create or unpack a file, the directory windows don't update
(yet). It requires libqt (v2.0), libstdc++, libm, glibc, libXext
and libX11.</p><p>gomenu:<a href="http://www.digizen.net/members/geoffm" target="_self">http://www.digizen.net/members/geoffm/</a></p><p>Many years ago, I can remember creating .bat files for DOS
systems so that techno-neanderthals could just type in a number and
the program they wanted to run would start. Well, guess what? If
you have a Linux system with too little RAM to efficiently run X,
you can have exactly the same thing with this nice program. Talk
about bringing back memories! These menus can be edited from the
menu&mdash;very nice. Now, what did I do with that old 486-25 with 8MB
RAM? It requires bash or pdksh.</p></div></div>
