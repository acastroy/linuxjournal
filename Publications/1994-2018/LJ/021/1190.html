    How to use the versatile command chmod.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2b3b4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Do you know how to rename a file you
can't read? Better yet, do you know how other users can rename your
files? Have you ever ftp'd a program from another host and been
unable to run it?
</p><p>The subject of file permissions, and how to manipulate them
with the <span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> command, is a good
place to start learning about these situations.</p><p>First, let's create a file and examine its long listing. (In
order to fit in the magazine, all the listings in this article are
trimmed to fit.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ touch test_file
$ ls -l test_file
-rw-rw-r--   1 eric     users
</pre><p>Since I created this file, it makes sense that the third
column shows my user name as the file's owner and that the fourth
shows my group. (On some systems, the group name may be the same as
the user name.) As you follow along in these examples, you will see
your username in place of &ldquo;eric&rdquo;.
</p><p>The leftmost column of the directory listing shows the file's
<span   class="bold"><b>mode</b></span>. Mode is the term used to
refer to a file's permissions. ls displays the file's type and mode
together as a grouping of ten one-character fields:</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2b3b818"></a><p class="title"><b></b></p><table     summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><p>Type</p></td><td><p>Owner</p></td><td><p>Group</p></td><td><p>World</p></td><td><p>-</p></td><td><p>rwx</p></td><td><p>rw-</p></td><td><p>r--</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The type field has several valid values. For the sake of this
tutorial, we are only concerned with two: empty
(<b  >-</b>) for a regular file, and <b  >d</b>
for directories.</p><p>The other three columns cover the three
<span   class="bold"><b>classes</b></span> of access that are stored
for each file in a Unix-like file system. Linux (and Unix)
evaluates access in terms of user ownership, group ownership and
world (or other).</p><p>For each of these classes, rights are evaluated in terms of
three <span   class="bold"><b>operations</b></span>: reading
(<b  >r</b>), writing (<b  >w</b>) and
executing (<b  >x</b>). The permissions above specify
&ldquo;full&rdquo; access for the owner, reading and writing for group, and
only reading for world (an unusual combination used for
demonstration). Those permissions specify that</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The owner of the file is allowed to read, write and
execute the file.</p></li><li><p>Any user who is a member of the group that owns the
file is permitted to write to the file.</p></li><li><p>Any other user can only read the file.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2b3c528"></a>Changing permissions</h2></div></div><p>If test_file were a very important document that we did not
want anyone to be able to modify or delete, we would need to remove
write access from group:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod g-w test_file
$ ls -l test_file
-rw-r--r--   1 eric     users
</pre><p>We see that the <b  >w</b> for group is now
replaced with a <b  >-</b>, signifying that write
permission is denied to members of the group
<b  >users</b>.
</p><p>If test_file contained sensitive information that only
members of the group <b  >users</b> should be able to
review:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod o-r test_file
$ ls -l test_file
-rw-r-----   1 eric     users
</pre><p>Now we see that the last triplet of the mode field, which
specifies permissions for world, are all dashes. This means that
other users who do not belong to the <b  >users</b> group
have no permissions to do anything with test_file whatsoever.
</p><p>The command line usage for chmod mode looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod [<span   class="emphasis"><em>options</em></span>] <span   class="emphasis"><em>new-mode</em></span> <b  >filename</b>
</pre><p>The new mode is specified in <span   class="bold"><b>octal
mode</b></span> or <span   class="bold"><b>symbolic mode</b></span>.
We'll cover symbolic mode first. In the first example we used
<b  >g-w</b> to remove write permission for group. As you
might be able to guess, <b  >g</b> stood for group,
<b  >-</b> for remove and <b  >w</b>
represented write permission.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod g+wx test_file
$ ls -l test_file
-rw-rwx---   1 eric     users
</pre><p>This operation added permission for group to write and execute.</p><p>Let's look at an example of these permissions in
action.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod u-rwx test_file
$ ls -l test_file
----rwx---   1 eric     users
$ cat test_file
cat: test_file: Permission denied
$ cat .profile &gt; test_file
bash: test_file: Permission denied
</pre><p>We are not able to display the file's contents because we do
not have read access to our own file. When we specified
<b  >u-rwx</b> to chmod, we removed all access for the
user (the file's owner). We were also denied permission when we
attempted to add the contents of another file to it since we
removed write access. (I should note that
<span   class="bold"><b>rm</b></span> would still be able to delete
this file, although it will normally request confirmation.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod u+rwx test_file
$ ls -l test_file
-rwxrwx---   1 eric     users
</pre><p>When we specify <b  >u+rwx</b>, all permissions are
restored. Removing permissions from a file we own does not affect
our ability to restore the permissions, because the mode is
<span   class="bold"><b>not</b></span> stored in the file. It is
stored in a structure called an inode entry. Only the owner of the
file (and root) may modify this.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2f353d8"></a>Understanding chmod</h2></div></div><p>Let's look at a summary of chmod's options, and then cover
each option in depth:</p><p>User</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>u user (owner)

$ chmod a+rwx test_file
$ ls -l test_file
-rwxrwxrwx   1 eric     users
</pre><p>This demonstrates the fourth possible symbol for user when
using symbolic mode. We used <b  >a</b> to set full
permissions for all user classes at once. Let's delete the file and
start over in order to demonstrate the difference between the
<b  >=</b> operator and the <b  >+</b> and
<b  >-</b> operators. (From here on, we'll assume that
you know how to get the directory listing, and won't list the ls
command.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ rm test_file
$ touch test_file
-rw-rw-r--   1 eric     users
$ chmod g+x test_file
-rw-rwxr--   1 eric     users
</pre><p>This added execute permission for group.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod g=x test_file
-rw---xr--   1 eric     users
</pre><p>The <b  >=</b> operators set group's permissions to
execute, and in doing so removed read and write permission. While
<b  >+</b> and <b  >-</b> set or unset the
permissions specified, <b  >=</b> will set
<span   class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> the mode specified and remove any
others.</p><p>Read, write and execute modes are very straightforward when
referring to files. Read and write allow a user to examine and
modify/delete data from a file, respectively. Execute allows a user
to execute a shell script or binary program. If you ftp a program
from one host to another and then try to run it without setting
execute permission, it will fail, since ftp does not set execute
permission.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2f360e8"></a>Directories</h2></div></div><p>For directories, the rules can be a bit more
complicated.</p><p>Read permission allows a user to examine the contents of a
directory.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir test_dir
$ touch test_dir/foo
$ ls test_dir
foo
$ chmod u-r test_dir
$ ls test_dir
ls: test_dir: Permission denied
</pre><p>Write permission allows a user to modify the contents
<span   class="bold"><b>of the directory</b></span>. That means that
lack of write permission on a directory does not prevent a user
from modifying a file within the directory, if the file's
permissions allow it. It <span   class="bold"><b>does</b></span>
prevent the user from renaming, moving, deleting or creating any
file in the directory. This is because a directory is a really a
file that contains a list of filenames, and so read and write
permission control access to that list.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod u=rx test_dir
dr-xrwxr-x   2 eric     users
$ touch test_dir/bar
touch: test_dir/bar: Permission denied
$ mv test_dir/foo ./foo
mv: cannot move `test_dir/foo' to `./foo':
Permission denied
</pre><p>This property also works the other way. Since write
permission allows the modification of directory entries, a user can
move or rename a file <span   class="bold"><b>without permission to
examine the contents</b></span>. This is a very good reason for
paying attention to write access for important directories.</p><p>To demonstrate:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l test_dir
-rw-rw-r--   2 eric  users  foo
$ chmod u=rwx test_dir
$ chmod u=rx test_dir/foo
$ cat .bashrc &gt; test_dir/foo
bash: test_dir/foo: Permission denied
$ mv test_dir/foo ./foo
$ ls test_dir
<span   class="emphasis"><em>(It's empty)</em></span>
$ ls foo
foo <span   class="emphasis"><em>(It's in our present directory.)</em></span>
</pre><p>Execute permission for directories (also referred to as
search permission) is also very important. Execute permission is
necessary for <span   class="bold"><b>accessing</b></span> a
directory.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod u=rwx test_dir
$ cp ~/.bashrc test_dir
<span   class="emphasis"><em>(any text file will do)</em></span>
$ chmod u=rw test_dir
$ cd test_dir
bash: test_dir: Permission denied
$ cat test_dir/.bashrc
cat: test_dir/.bashrc: Permission denied
</pre><p>This copy of .bashrc does not do us a lot of good. However,
setting execute permission for directory and not setting read or
write can come in handy.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod u=x test_dir
$ cat test_dir/.bashrc
<span   class="emphasis"><em>(we see the contents of the file)</em></span>
$ ls test_dir
ls: test_dir: Permission denied
</pre><p>A directory that has execute permission only can be used to
&ldquo;hide&rdquo; files. Only users who know the exact file name and path
can access them; this includes both data files and programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2f368d0"></a>Conditional execute</h2></div></div><p>Let's return to test_file to examine the <b  >X</b>
option.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r test_file
-rw-r--r--   1 eric     users
$ chmod o+X test_file
-rw-r--r--   1 eric     users
$ chmod u+x test_file
-rwxr--r--   1 eric     users
$ chmod o+X test_file
-rwxr--r-x   1 eric     users
</pre><p>In the first command, we see that we can set options for more
than one class at a time by using a comma to separate the mode
specifications. Here, we set the mode so that no user has execute
permission. In the second command, we try to set execute permission
for other with <b  >X</b>. This fails, because
<b  >X</b> only works when one of the classes already has
execute permissions. When we add execute permissions for owner,
<b  >X</b> sets executable permission for other.</p><p>The <b  >s</b> option sets or removes set UID
(SUID) and set GID (SGID) mode. These modes are very important in
terms of UNIX/Linux security. When a file has SUID mode set, the
process executing it has the effective rights of the file's owner
for the duration of the program's execution.</p><p>For example, the program <span   class="bold"><b>dip</b></span>
is used to create SLIP network connections. This requires root
access, because creating a network interface device requires root
access. Instead of forcing users to become root in order to use
dip, which would require that the users know the root password, the
dip program can belong to root and have the SUID mode set.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -l /usr/sbin/dip
-r-s--x---   1 root     dip
</pre><p>The <b  >s</b> in the spot for user's execute field
indicates the SUID mode is set. Another example of a use for the
SUID mode is the passwd program, which allows users to modify the
passwd (or shadow) file.
</p><p>For security reasons, the SUID bit can affect only binary
programs; it has no effect on shell scripts in Linux.</p><p>The SGID mode sets the group instead of the owner, and is set
with (for example) <b  >g+s</b>. It also has another
purpose.</p><p>When a user creates a new file the group ownership defaults
to the user's default group, which is the one listed in the passwd
file. Sometimes users belong to more than one group and want to
share files. The SGID mode can provide a convenient method for
this. If the SGID mode bit is set for a directory, new files
created in that directory will belong to that group, regardless of
the creator's default group. If you belong to more than one group,
try this. (You can check what groups you belong to with the
<span   class="bold"><b>id</b></span> command. The default group is
listed first, and you can use the chgrp command to change the group
ownership of a file to another group you are a member of.)</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir test_dir
$ chgrp nondefault test_dir
$ chmod g+s test_dir
$ touch test_dir/foo
$ ls -l test_dir/foo
-rw-rw-r--   1 eric     nondefault
</pre><p>The SUID and SGID modes can be a security hole. However, when
used carefully, they are very valuable tools and actually enhance
system security by providing an alternative to distributing
important passwords.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2f370b8"></a>Make it simple</h2></div></div><p>Specifying user classes can be used to simplify copying
permissions.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod g=u test_file
-rwxrwxr-x   1 eric     users
</pre><p>This copied the permissions from user to group. All of the
classes can be used on the right side of the <b  >+</b>,
<b  >-</b> or <b  >=</b> operators in this way.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod o-u test_file
-rwxrwx---   1 eric     users
</pre><p>This cleared all of the permissions that user has from other.</p><p>The last mode listed above is the <b  >t</b>
option, known as the &ldquo;sticky bit&rdquo;. This mode is actually
supported on the command line for compatibility purposes with shell
scripts from older operating systems. It is not needed for Linux.
If an installation guide instructs you to use it, it actually does
nothing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2e490b8"></a>Do your math</h2></div></div><p>File access modes can also be set using octal notation. This
syntax is built by adding the mode fields together. For each user
class, the fields are calculated this way:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>4 Read</p></li><li><p>2 Write</p></li><li><p>1 Execute</p></li></ul></div><p>Full permissions for any class would be <b  >7</b>,
no permissions would be <b  >0</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod 754 test_file
-rwxr-xr-x   1 eric     users
</pre><p>The classes are passed to chmod in the same order ls displays
them. The mode we set is broken down this way:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
      Owner = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
      Group = 4 + 1     = 5
      World = 4         = 4
</pre><p>Octal mode is convenient because other utilities, such as
find, expect modes to be expressed this way.</p><p>In octal mode, SUID and SGID are set by specifying them in
another column <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the user mode. For SUID
use 4, for SGID use 2, and use 6 for both:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod 4755 test_file
-rwsr-xr-x   1 eric     users
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2e49798"></a>Power chmod</h2></div></div><p>Chmod also provides a few command line options to simplify
administrative tasks. For changing file permissions in directory
trees use <b  >-R</b>.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod -R g-w test_dir
</pre><p>This would remove write permission for group for all of the
files in and below test_dir.
</p><p>In order to control the output of messages from chmod use
<b  >-c</b>, <b  >-v</b> and
<b  >-f</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ chmod -v 700 test_file
mode of test_file changed to 0700 (rwx------)
</pre><p>This option caused chmod to display how the permissions of
test_file were set. The <b  >-c</b> option causes chmod
to display messages only when files are changed, and the
<b  >-f</b> option suppresses messages about files that
can't be changed.
</p><p>Chmod also provides a <b  >--version</b> option to
display the version and <b  >--help</b> to see a short
help message.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a43580.0x2e49d70"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>File permissions are an integral part of Linux. The same
