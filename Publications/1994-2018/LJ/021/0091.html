Humanitarian Support Operations Conference? The Center for
Excellence in Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance's
Humanitarian Support Operations Conference was held recently at the
Ilikai Hotel in Waikiki. The event drew over 170 people from 23
Asian-Pacific countries including Thailand, China, South Korea, New
Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Mongolia, Australia, the
Philippines, Indonesia and many others.
</p><p>Supporting the conference was a pair of Linux machines
providing Internet access (WWW and Mail) running NCSA's Mosaic and
the COE's Conference Home page. Attendee photos were digitized and
put online using an Apple QuickTake camera. Events included a
working session and introduction to Linux, which was a first
experience for many of these countries.</p><p>Future COE plans include travelling to these countries with
Linux laptops, as we've chosen to use the OS as our Internet
connectivity platform used with developing nations. In short,
choosing Linux gives us a cost-free method of connecting dozens of
dissimilar host sites with a similar operating environment. We'll
begin building custom database applications, namely a front end for
our Oracle SQL server (Sparc 20 based) for Linux by the first week
of October.</p><p>We're very excited about Linux, and everyone at the
conference was equally enthusiastic about seeing the &ldquo;Linux
Work-Servers&rdquo; and the power they give to otherwise blah-entrenched
x86s. One of the delegates from India asked me if his 486-100 would
be suited for such a project...I had to laugh when I told him that
the machine he was using was a 486-33! (We had 20 inch monitors on
the desk and the boxes underneath...so it looked like we had some
real powerstations going!)</p><p>If you'd like additional information about what our future
plans for Linux hold, please don't hesitate to ask.</p><p>Rob!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb43580.0xc3b3a0"></a><i  >LJ</i> Founds a University (Not!)</h2></div></div><p>In case you hadn't gotten this, I enclose the following reply
