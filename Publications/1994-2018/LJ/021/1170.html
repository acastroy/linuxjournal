    A lot of UNIX security is based on passwords, and in this first
    part of a two-part article, &AElig;leen helps explain many of thei
    issues involved in setting up and maintaining passwords on
    Linux systems. Next month's installment will cover other system
    security issues.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b1580.0x18a9500"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the most hackneyed cliches in all
of UNIX culture is that UNIX security is a contradiction in terms.
While things aren't quite as hopeless as this cynical view, it is
important to realize that a secure system is something you create,
not something you get automatically when you install any current
Linux distribution (or any other UNIX operating system for that
matter).
</p><p>This article provides an overview of UNIX security issues,
and discusses the resources and tools available to Linux system
administrators or anyone responsible for administering a Linux
system&mdash;which are not necessarily synonymous. It considers what
the most important issues are and what exists to defend the system.
And since many of the most egregious &ldquo;UNIX&rdquo; security problems are
actually vulnerabilities in TCP/IP networking and its component
protocols, we naturally consider network security issues, as well
as those relevant to an isolated computer system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b1580.0x18a9660"></a>What is Security?</h2></div></div><p>General discussions of computer security traditionally focus
on the types of losses that can result from inadequate security
measures:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Loss of equipment. The first or last threat to any
computer system (depending on your point of view) is the loss of
the computer itself. This can result from a variety of causes:
theft, fire, water, earthquakes and other natural disasters,
vandalism, and accidents (e.g., a user spilling coffee on
it).</p></li><li><p>Loss of data. This type of loss can also occur in a
variety of ways: data could be obtained by someone who should not
have it (for example, a competitor), files could be accidentally or
deliberately damaged or destroyed, or information that should have
remained private could become publically accessible or
broadcast.</p></li><li><p>Loss of use. A third type of loss can occur when
neither the equipment nor its data is damaged, destroyed or
removed, but the system is nevertheless unable to perform some or
all of its normal functions. For example, an extended power outage
could cause such a loss of use; the 1988 Internet worm incident is
an example of software rendering a computer unusable.</p></li></ul></div><p>Depending on your situation, some of these threats are
obviously more potentially hazardous to you than others.</p><p>Effective thinking about security begins by considering
potential losses rather than potential threats, because doing so
allows you to place the threats in the context of your system and
thereby make appropriate choices about how to prevent and address
them. For example, every system has the potential of being broken
into by an unauthorized person. However, the specific nature of
that threat changes depending on the sort of loss that would be its
most serious consequence&mdash;as do the corresponding measures to
prevent the loss.</p><p>A successful intruder always has the potential to alter or
destroy any file on the system, so every system needs to guard
against and have a plan for recovering from that eventuality. In
addition, for a system containing sensitive or proprietary data
(customer credit card numbers, source codes for software products
under development, and so on) one might need to consider ways of
securing such data even from the root account. On the other hand,
if loss of use is the primary loss against which a system needs to
be protected, then devising ways of quickly identifying and
neutralizing such an attack is much more important than providing
extra security for any of the data on the system.</p><p>As these scenarios suggest, security involves more than just
prevention against attacks. Equally important components of
computer security are the recovery plans which specify what to do
when something goes wrong. Computer security is not something you
think about once in a while, but rather something that is an
integral part of your thinking and actions in every administrative
activity you perform. It includes the following concerns (not all
of which will necessarily apply to any specific system):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Physical system access</p></li><li><p>Theft prevention&mdash;locks and so on</p></li><li><p>Prevention of physical and electronic
vandalism</p></li><li><p>Ensuring continuous power via an uninterruptible
power supply (UPS) unit</p></li><li><p>Fire control systems, surge suppressors, and other
devices to prevent damage from the external environment</p></li><li><p>User authentication: passwords and other
mechanisms</p></li><li><p>Modem access (dialin and dialout)</p></li><li><p>File ownership and protection</p></li><li><p>Encryption of very sensitive or private data</p></li><li><p>Network access policies and network software
configuration</p></li><li><p>NFS configuration</p></li><li><p>Procedures and policies related to building,
testing, installing and using public domain software</p></li><li><p>Backup procedures</p></li><li><p>Secure storage of backup media (including offsite
copies)</p></li><li><p>Storage of original operating system media</p></li><li><p>Disaster recovery plans</p></li><li><p>User training for good security practices</p></li></ul></div><p>A thorough discussion of all of these topics would consume
several entire issues of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, so we
focus on operating system-level protections and solutions useful
for Linux systems, in terms of both &ldquo;standard&rdquo; features and
useful additional packages. Security facilities offered by the
various Linux distributions vary considerably, but no current
distribution includes everything that a prudent system
administrator would want to have and use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b1580.0x18aa7e8"></a>Security Resources</h2></div></div><pre     class="programlisting">

Linux systems. However, the protection offered by passwords is only
as good as the passwords themselves. If a hacker decides to attack
the accounts on your system, bad passwords are almost as bad as no
passwords at all.</p><p>There are several things you can do to ensure that the
password facility is providing the best protection it is capable
of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Make sure all active accounts have passwords and
that system accounts not intended for user logins (e.g. bin) are
disabled (do this by placing an asterisk in the password field for
that account).</p></li><li><p>Secure the encoded versions of the system's
passwords by using a shadow password file.</p></li><li><p>Educate users about keeping passwords secret,
selecting hard-to-crack passwords, changing passwords as necessary,
using different passwords at different sites, and similar security
practices. Institute password aging and/or new password obscurity
checking if appropriate.</p></li></ul></div><p>The first item is self-explanatory; we look at the others in
detail.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b1580.0x1ca3538"></a>Shadow Password Files</h2></div></div><p>Shadow password files are designed to correct the security
hole resulting from the normal password file being world-readable.
Everyone needs to be able to view the contents of /etc/passwd so
that things like file ownership displays properly (UIDs are
translated into usernames). However, since the file is readable,
anyone can make a copy of it. This means someone with legitimate or
illegitimate access to an ordinary user account can copy it and
attempt to crack the passwords of more powerful accounts at his
leisure.</p><p>A shadow password file facility removes the encoded passwords
from the normal password file and places them in another file,
conventionally /etc/shadow, which can be read only by root. The
shadow package provides shadow password file capabilities for a
variety of UNIX systems including Linux. It is included in some
Linux distributions by default. It includes replacements for the
login, passwd, and su commands as well as many utilities for
creating and manipulating the shadow password file and account
entries within it.</p><p>Building the shadow package is quite straightforward. If
you've retrieved a version that has been ported to Linux, you'll
generally only have to modify the config.h file. I recommend the
following settings (culled from various points within that
file):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* Use shadow password file.      */
#define SHADOWPWD
/* Use up to 16 char. passwords.  */
#define DOUBLESIZE
/* Enable password aging checks.  */
#define AGING
/* Log events to syslog facility. */
#define USE_SYSLOG
/* Support for remote logins.     */
#define RLOGIN
#define UT_HOST
/* Data file for most recent login time records */
#define LASTFILE "/var/adm/lastlog"
</pre><p>Once the package is built and installed, the
<b  >pwconv</b> command may be used to create an initial
/etc/shadow file. It creates the files /etc/npasswd and
/etc/nshadow. The former is an altered version of the original
password file in which the password field in each entry has been
replaced by an <b  >x</b>; the latter is the
corresponding shadow password file. In order to activate them, you
must rename them by hand:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /etc
# mv passwd passwd.prev
# cp npasswd passwd
# cp nshadow shadow
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b1580.0x1ca38a8"></a>Password Aging</h2></div></div><p>Users don't like to change their passwords, and left to their
own devices they will literally never do so. The shadow package
includes an optional password aging facility which enables a system
administrator to specify how often users must change their
passwords. Whether using these features is necessary or not depends
on the needs of your site.</p><p>Entries in /etc/shadow have the following format:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span>:<span   class="emphasis"><em>password</em></span>:<span   class="emphasis"><em>change_date</em></span>:<span   class="emphasis"><em>min_change</em></span>:\
 <span   class="emphasis"><em>max_change</em></span>:<span   class="emphasis"><em>warn</em></span>:<span   class="emphasis"><em>inactive</em></span>:<span   class="emphasis"><em>expire</em></span>:
</pre><p>where the first two fields are the username and encoded
password for the account. The other fields relate to account
expiration and password aging. [Note that in the shadow file, it
cannot be continued across two lines, as we have done here to make
it fit in the magazine&mdash;ED]</p><p><b  ><i><tt>change_date</tt></i></b>
encodes the date of the most recent password change.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>min_change</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>max_change</em></span>
indicate the minimum and maximum number of days between password
changes, and <b  ><i><tt>warn</tt></i></b>
indicates the number of days before a password expires that the
user is warned of this fact.
<b  ><i><tt>inactive</tt></i></b> specifies
how many days after its password has expired that an account is
automatically disabled, and
<b  ><i><tt>expire</tt></i></b> encodes the
date upon which the account itself will expire and be
disabled.</p><p>Here is a sample entry from /etc/shadow:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chavez:XdleIqAert:9422:7:180:5:21::
</pre><p>User chavez can keep the same password for at most 180 days,
and she will be warned 5 days before her password expires. When she
does change her password, she must keep the new one for at least 7
days. If she doesn't use her account for 21 days, it will be
automatically disabled. No expiration date is set for user chavez's
account.</p><p>Once /etc/shadow is installed, it can be edited directly.
However, the shadow package also provides tools for manipulating
entries within it. Its version of the passwd command updates
passwords within the shadow password file, and the command also has
additional options for modifying the other password settings. For
example, the following command changes the minimum password
lifetime to 2 days, the maximum password lifetime to 1 year, the
warning period to 3 days, and the inactive period to two months for
user chavez:</p><p><b  ># passwd -n 2 -x 365 -w 3 -i 60
chavez</b></p><p>If you wanted to remove all aging controls from an account,
use this combination of options:</p><p><b  ># passwd -n 0 -x 99999 -i -1 angela</b></p><p>These are the default values (along with a warning period of
14 days, which is irrelevant when passwords essentially never
expire).</p><p>Account expiration dates are set with the usermod command.
The following command sets the account expiration date to January
1, 1999 for user chavez:</p><p><b  ># usermod -e 1/1/1999 chavez</b></p><p>Note that the useradd and usermod commands may also be used
to create user accounts and specify or alter these and other
account settings.</p><p>passwd's <b  >-l</b> and
<b  >-u</b>options may be used to manually lock (i.e.,
prevent logins) and unlock an account respectively:</p><p><b  ># passwd -l badboy</b></p><p>Finally, the <b  >chage -d</b> command may be used
to force a user to change his password at his next login; this
option sets the date of the last password change field. It may be
used to force a password change at a user's next login, provided
that a maximum password lifetime is also set. Here is a simple
script which accomplishes this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/csh
# force_change <span   class="emphasis"><em>username</em></span> -- run as root
chage -l $1 &gt;&amp; /dev/null
if ($status == 1) then
   echo force_change: invalid user "\$1\"
   exit 1
endif
set max=`grep ^$1\: /etc/shadow | \
  awk -F: '{print $5}'`
chage -d `date +%D` $1
set today=`grep ^$1\: /etc/shadow | \
  awk -F: '{print $3}'`
set yest=`expr $today - 1`
if ($max &gt;= $yest) set max=`expr $yest - 1`
set date=`expr $yest - $max`
chage -M $max -I 2 -W 7 -d $date $1
</pre><p>The script extracts the current maximum password lifetime
setting, sets the password change date to today, and then extracts
the equivalent integer value (the number of days since 1/1/1970).
It then sets the password change date to yesterday, reducing the
maximum lifetime if necessary so that a password expiration is
possible on that date. It also sets the inactivity period to 2 days
and the warning period to 1 week.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b1580.0x1ca4980"></a>shadow's Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>Default settings for password aging settings are defined in
the configuration file for the shadow package, usually defined as
/etc/login.defs. This file contains a variety of entries which
control various aspects of how the package functions, all
well-documented in its comment lines, and you should examine this
file carefully and select settings which make sense for your
system.</p><p>Here are some of the most important entries from this file,
along with my suggestions for their values:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Enable dialup passwords.
DIALUPS_CHECK_ENAB      yes

# Track login failures in /var/adm/faillog.
FAILLOG_ENAB            yes

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b1580.0x1ca4b38"></a>Selecting Good Passwords</h2></div></div><p>Making sure that all accounts have passwords that are changed
regularly is only part of what is necessary to get the maximum
protection from passwords. Passwords must also remain secret, and
they must be hard to guess&mdash;for either a program or a human&mdash;to
be most effective. The first of these can only be ensured by
educating users about the importance of passwords to system
security. It is possible to have a little more control over the
second.</p><p>Bad password choices include all correctly-spelled words,
proper names, and names or numbers significant to the person
choosing the password, as well as simple transformations of any of
these items: reversals, simple capitalization changes, rotations,
adding a digit at the end, and the like.</p><p>Good passwords include a variety of character types&mdash;upper
and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols, and control characters.
Longer passwords are also better than shorter ones. I strongly
recommend enabling the shadow package's double-length password
capabilities, setting a minimum length of 10 or 12 characters and
allowing up to 16.</p><p>The shadow package has only minimal capabilities for checking
the qualities of the password that users choose. However, there are
other packages which provide this function by substituting an
alternate version of the passwd command. The npasswd package can
check proposed passwords against words in online dictionaries. The
passwd+ package checks proposed passwords against one or more
dictionaries, and also tests transformations of the proposed
passwords according to instructions provided by the configuration
file. The file /etc/passwd.test can be customized by the system
administrator. Listing 1 gives some sample entries from the file
which will give you a sense of passwd+'s capabilities.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# sample passwd+ configuration file
# Test                          Error Message

(%#l&gt;5)|(%#c==0)                Must include a nonalphabetic character.
#

"%*p"=~"^%*f%*f$"               Can't use doubled first name as password.
#
{tr A-Z a-z &lt; /usr/dict/words} =~ "%*p"   Password found in dictionary.
</pre><p>Each entry lists a type of unacceptable password and gives an
appropriate error message to be displayed to the user if such a
password is proposed. The following symbols are used in the sample
rules defining unacceptable passwords (passwd+ offers many more as
well):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;%p  proposed password
&lt;li&gt;%a  alphanumeric character
&lt;li&gt;%l  lowercase letters
&lt;li&gt;%c  capital letters
&lt;li&gt;%w  numerals
&lt;li&gt;%u  username
&lt;li&gt;%f  first name

reversed proposed password)
&lt;li&gt;%*x lowercased version of x
&lt;li&gt;%#  number of x's in proposed password
(e.g. %#w = # of numerals)
&lt;li&gt;&amp;   logical AND
&lt;li&gt;|   logical OR
&lt;li&gt;==  equals
&lt;li&gt;=~  matches pattern
&lt;li&gt;^   beginning of line
&lt;li&gt;$   end of line
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre><p>The first section of the sample file checks structure of the
proposed password. The first entry rejects 8-character
all-lowercase passwords, and the second entry says that passwords
containing 6 or more lowercase letters must also contain a capital
letter.</p><p>The second section of the file tests the password against
items from the user's password file entry as well as some
transformations of them. The third section performs a
case-insensitive comparison of the password with the words in the
system's dictionary file.</p><p>By default, passwd+ is designed to be used as a stand-alone
replacement for the normal passwd command, and it is not aware of
the shadow password file. However, it is not very difficult to
modify it for use on systems with shadow passwords; one method
involves modifying the obscure routine in the shadow package to
call the verify routine in the passwd+ package.</p><p>You can also use the Crack facility to check the quality of
users' existing passwords. (Note that it is unethical to run Crack
without permission on the password file from systems where you are
not the system administrator!) Crack is easy to build and use, and
it includes a shadmrg utility (in its Scripts subdirectory) which
can reconstruct a traditional /etc/passwd-style file on a system
using the shadow package. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /usr/src/Crack*
# Scripts/shadmrg &gt; passwd.test
# Crack passwd.test
</pre><p>If you choose to use Crack, it is extremely important to
ensure that the program and all of the data and results files that
it creates are protected against all non-root access.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b1580.0x1ca5060"></a>Secondary Authentication</h2></div></div><p>In some circumstances, you may want to use some means of
determining that a user is who she says she is in addition to
standard passwords. To address such a need, the shadow package also
supports entries like the following in /etc/shadow:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chavez:XdleIqAert;@/sbin/extra:9422:7:180:5:21::
harvey:&lt;\@&gt;/sbin/extra:9233:0:99999:0:-1::
</pre><p>When user chavez logs in, she is prompted for her password,
and then the program /sbin/extra runs as a secondary authentication
program. This program, supplied by the system administrator, can
perform whatever sort of additional authentication is desired,
returning a value of 0 or 1 depending on whether the user has
passed or failed. The second entry indicates that user harvey runs
/sbin/extra as his only authentication method. In the shadow file
syntax, the @ sign introduces the alternate or additional
authentication program, and a semicolon is used to separate it from
the encoded password.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b1580.0x1bb5b28"></a>Dialup Passwords</h2></div></div><p>The final feature of the shadow package we consider is its
dialup password facility, which allows you to require an additional
password from users who connect to the system via a dialup line.
When this feature is enabled, two additional configuration files
are used, /etc/dialups and /etc/d_passwd. /etc/dialups contains a
list of special filenames for serial lines that are to be protected
with an additional password whenever someone dials into the system
(one per line), and /etc/d_passwd holds the encoded dialup
passwords.</p><p>Dialup passwords are assigned on a shell-by-shell basis, and
the dpasswd command is used to create and change them. For example,
the following command will allow you to change the current dialup
password for the shell /bin/bash:</p><p><b  ># dpasswd /bin/bash</b></p><p>Dialup passwords will not be required from users using shells
that are not listed in /etc/d_passwd.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b1580.0x1bb5d90"></a>sudo: Selective Access to root</h2></div></div><p>One of the biggest weaknesses with UNIX security in general
is its all-or-nothing approach to system privilege: root is
powerful, so it is only prudent to limit access to the root account
as much as possible. The sudo facility enables non-root users to
run specified commands as root without having to know the root
password, allowing a system administrator to provide users with
just the level of access they actually need.</p><p>A user uses the facility by prefacing the command he wants to
run with the sudo command:</p><p><b  >$ sudo mount hamlet:/data /mnt</b></p><p>:sudo will require the user to enter his own password before
completing the command. Thus, in this case, using sudo allows this
user to use the mount command without knowing the root
password.</p><p>Access to sudo is controlled by its configuration file,
/etc/sudoers. This file specifies which users can use sudo along
with the commands they are allowed to execute. Here is a small
extract from such a file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chavez  ALL=ALL
harvey  ALL=/bin/mount,/bin/umount
nelson  ALL=!/sbin/shutdown
</pre><p>Usernames are the first field in each entry, followed by one
or more access description strings which have the general form:
<b  ><i><tt>host(s)</tt></i>=<i><tt>command(s)</tt></i></b>.
Based upon these entries, user chavez can use sudo to run any
command on any system, user harvey can mount and unmount disks, and
user nelson can run any command except shutdown. Note that these
examples represent only the simplest form of this file; its actual
syntax is very flexible and powerful, allowing you to define named
groups of hosts and/or commands and thereby specify exact access
for each user-host-command combination in as much detail as
necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17b1580.0x1bb6208"></a>For More Information About System
