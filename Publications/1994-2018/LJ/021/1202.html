    Linux on Alpha AXP&mdash;Milo, The Mini-loader
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112c4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Late in 1994, I was in the US visiting my
home group in Hudson, Massachusetts, where the Alpha AXP processors
are built. On a free morning, I followed up a rumour that I had
heard a few weeks before. The rumour was that Jim Paradis was
porting Linux to Alpha. At that time I did not know anything about
Linux other than that it was a freeware version of Unix developed
by a student in Finland. When I caught up with Jim, I was in for a
surprise. Well, two surprises actually: Linux&mdash;running on an Alpha
laptop. We chatted for a while and I soon became infected (if
that's the right phrase) with Jim's enthusiasm.
</p><p>One subject that we discussed was Linux/Alpha's need for a
small loader. On an Intel PC system, the firmware that initialises
the system when it is powered on is known as BIOS. There are
several very well known providers of BIOS code, and PCs are built
to conform to a very rigid set of rules, which means that PCs are
very similar to each other in hardware terms. The equivalent
software in an Alpha-based system from Digital (and even in a
VAX-based system) is the <span   class="bold"><b>console</b></span>,
and within Digital it is known as the <span   class="bold"><b>SRM
console</b></span>, since its interface is described in the System
Reference Manual.</p><p>So, just why did Linux need the SRM console? Firstly, Linux
needs to be loaded from some media, and the SRM contains device
drivers to do just that. Secondly, Linux needed the Digital Unix
PALcode. PALcode can be thought of as a tiny software layer that
tailors the chip to a particular operating system. It runs in a
special mode (PALmode) and has certain restrictions, but it uses
the standard Alpha instruction set. In this way, the Alpha chip can
run such diverse operating systems as Windows NT, Open VMS, Digital
Unix and, of course, Linux. Finally, Jim was using the SRM call
backs in his prototype device drivers. From Linux's point of view,
though, the SRM Console does too much. It contains call back
procedures that allow the running operating system to write
messages to the console or to write environment variables and so
on. Linux makes no use of these functions; in fact, the only part
of the SRM console needed, once it loads Linux, is the
PALcode.</p><p>I volunteered to write a loader that would be small and would
do only those things that Linux needed. Like all good projects, my
one-man effort had some straightforward project goals. First and
foremost, the software would be under free licence, built and
freely distributed as part of standard Linux distributions.
Secondly, Linux drivers should be able to be used within Milo
without modification or even re-compilation. Thirdly, it should
maximize the amount of memory available to Linux. Little did I
realise quite what I was letting myself in for.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112c768"></a>Milo</h2></div></div><p>Milo contains the following functional pieces:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>PALcode</p></li><li><p>Device drivers</p></li><li><p>Linux Kernel and pseudo-Kernel</p></li><li><p>Linux Kernel interface code</p></li><li><p>User interface code</p></li></ul></div><p>Finding Digital Unix PALcode was no problem. Back in 1992
when Digital announced the Alpha processor, it also announced that
it was moving into the merchant chip market. I joined a small group
in the UK to provide engineering effort in Europe to further these
aims. We are a small offshoot of the main group, which is based in
the silicon factory in Hudson, Mass. We build evaluation boards for
the Alpha processors and PCI peripheral chips. These systems
included a very low level Evaluation Board Debug Monitor that uses
Digital Unix PALcode. The sources for the Evaluation Board Debug
Monitor and the PALcode are under free licence.</p><p>Although this PALcode is fully compliant with the interface
described in the Alpha Architecture Manual, there are some
differences between it and the SRM console's PALcode. One of the
differences between Alpha based systems is the way interrupts are
handled outside of the processor itself. There are a limited number
of interrupt signals into the CPU itself, and the number varies
from CPU to CPU, but there are typically three: timer, I/O and
non-maskable interrupt.</p><p>The way in which real device interrupts are mapped onto CPU
interrupts is system-specific. Most current Alpha systems include
an ISA bus, whose interrupts are routed through a pair of 8259s in
the same way as on x86 PCs. The SRM console PALcode handles these
differences and interprets the interrupt, passing it to the OS's
interrupt handling code as an &ldquo;SCB offset&rdquo; (described by Jim
Paradis in last month's Kernel Korner). The PALcode used in Milo
does not do this interpretation, so the OS's interrupt handling
code must do it instead. Particularly with PCI devices, there must
be code in the PCI BIOS code and within the interrupt handler that
understands how interrupts are routed in the system. One side
effect of this is that when Linux has been loaded by Milo, the
interrupt handler can handle more than one device's interrupt each
time it is called.</p><p>One interesting and useful feature of the example PALcode I
adopted from our Alpha evaluation boards is that it allows the
Evaluation Board Debug Monitor to run in 1-to-1 physical addressing
mode. Bit 0 of the virtual page table base register turns this
feature on and off. When translation buffer misses occur, the
PALcode builds a new page table entry and inserts it into the
cache. Pretty much the first thing that Milo does when it is loaded
is to swap to this PALcode in physical address mode. The last thing
that the Mini loader does is to swap to this PALcode again, this
time passing final control to the Linux kernel.</p><p>Milo must turn virtual memory mapping on as it passes control
to the kernel, because Linux expects that a control structure
called the Hardware Restart Parameter Block (HWRPB) is at the right
virtual address. Amongst other things, this describes the type of
system and how much memory is free, together with where the memory
is. As Linux was first loaded via the SRM console, it naturally
used the interface provided by the SRM, which was the HWRPB, as
described in the Alpha Architecture Manual. I could see no reason
to change this interface: there are enough interfaces in the world,
so why invent yet another one?</p><p>In order for Milo to set up the memory mapping correctly, it
must itself have a good idea of what memory is available and what
it is being used for. It finds the amount of memory available
because after the PAL reset code has been executed, the size of
memory is put into the impure area, a data structure shared between
the PALcode and the console or Evaluation Board Debug Monitor. Milo
keeps a memory map describing what each page in the system is being
used for. While device drivers are running, they allocate temporary
memory and use it. Just before control is passed to Linux, Milo
must build a correct memory cluster description in the HWRPB, and
the memory map is used to do this. Pages are marked as &ldquo;free&rdquo;,
&ldquo;allocated&rdquo; or &ldquo;temporarily allocated&rdquo; in the memory map. When Milo
builds the memory cluster descriptions in the HWRPB, it treats all
temporarily allocated memory as free, since they will be free once
Linux starts to run. In this way, the only memory that is marked as
allocated is the memory containing the PALcode (8 pages), the
memory for the HWRPB (1 page) and the memory for the level 2 and
level 3 page tables (2 pages): 11 pages in total. I think I've
succeeded in my goal of maximizing the amount of memory available
to Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112ce48"></a>Device drivers</h2></div></div><p>One of the really excellent things about Linux is the number
of device drivers that have been developed for it. It seems as if
any commercially-available card or chip set has a driver already
written for it. It therefore seemed vital that Milo should be able
to make use of those drivers. This allows companies building
Alpha-based systems to differentiate their products by having a
vast choice of possible devices.</p><p>To run the device drivers unmodified, I had to duplicate some
services of the Linux kernel. Originally, I planned not to have
real interrupts, but instead to poll the drivers. This was the way
that Milo worked in Linux 1.1.68. However, once I started to try
and get the NCR 53C810 SCSI driver working in Milo, I ended up
needing proper interrupt handling, and it seemed best to take the
interrupt handling directly from Linux, which I did.</p><p>I have tried to keep the number of Linux services that I have
had to duplicate in Milo to a minimum. After all, as Linux
progresses, these routines tend to need re-writing. A good example
is the change from 1.1.68 and 1.2.8; the floppy driver changed its
way of determining that it was running during kernel
initialisation. This caused me headaches as I figured this
out.</p><p>Maybe over time I will incorporate more of the real Linux
kernel into Milo, but it is supposed to be the Mini loader, so I do
not want to add the whole of the kernel into it. Right now, Milo
includes the PCI BIOS code, the block device code, the interrupt
handling and DMA code directly from the kernel. The scheduling
services are mine and I cannot see them changing unless I add
multi-threading support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112d058"></a>Using Milo</h2></div></div><p>The final functional piece of Milo is the part that most
users see, the user interface. Milo can operate via the serial
port, but mainly people use it via the system console. For this
reason, it must have some keyboard and VGA initialization
code.</p><p>The keyboard code is very very simple and does just enough to
take in commands correctly. Linux itself assumes that some BIOS
code has initialized the VGA device and its console device drivers
just use it; that meant that Milo had to initialize the VGA device.
There are two ways of doing this. The first is to have very simple
ISA VGA initialisation code, and this is how Milo first operated.
The second way is to include BIOS emulation code that can run the
on-board initialisation (which is Intel x86 object code) from the
different video cards. David Mosberger-Tang pulled this part of
Milo together, with the result that it can successfully initialise
a number of common ISA and PCI graphics cards.</p><p>The Milo interface is meant to be very simple and do just
enough to get the right kernel loaded and to pass the right boot
arguments to it. Typing anything other than a legal command
displays all of the commands available. Right now, Milo assumes
that all devices that it can see are available to boot from and
will attempt to use the EXT2 file system with them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112d210"></a>Loading the Loader</h2></div></div><p>Milo was developed on an Alpha evaluation board (an EB66,
which is a 21066 based system similar to the AxpPCI33). This meant
that loading and testing Milo was easy, since the Evaluation Board
Debug Monitor was running. However, for real systems like the
AxpPCI33 (Noname), Milo needs to be loaded some other way.</p><p>Alpha-based systems boot in several steps. The first step,
immediately after power on, is to clock the SROM code directly into
the I-Cache stream and then to start executing it. This code does
really basic system set up such as figuring out how many DRAM slots
are occupied, and with what size of memory. The next step varies
from system to system, but essentially that SROM code loads the
firmware code (whatever it is) into memory and passes control to it
in PALmode. This is the PALcode reset entry point for the image.
Some firmware, notably Milo, has the address of the entry point to
the user-mode firmware defaulted in the PALcode, and that is where
control is passed to when the PALcode reset code has finished
initialising the system. Other systems have this information stored
in NVRAM or infer it from jumper settings.</p><p>For a variety of reasons, Milo can be loaded from a failsafe
boot block floppy, from flash, and via the Windows NT ARC firmware.
What varies most from system to system is where the SROM code is
able to load firmware from. On the AxpPCI33, the SROM code is
capable of loading from flash, from a serial line, or from a
failsafe boot block floppy. On the AlphaPC64, the failsafe boot
block floppy is not supported. All of this is controlled by jumpers
and/or boot options saved in NVRAM (in the TOY clock in the
AlphaPC64's case). There are systems that do not support flash and
instead have ROMs. These are not easy for users to change without
access to a ROM blower. and so yet another way must be found for
Milo to be loaded. Paradoxically, you could load Milo via the SRM
console, but a more fruitful approach is to load it via the Windows
NT ARC firmware, since that is the firmware these boards ship
with.</p><p>There are a number of ways to put an image into flash, and
for this reason Milo supports running any image, so long as it is
linked to where the Linux kernel usually is. In this way, I can
build images that update the flash when loaded and not burden Milo
with knowing about the flash requirements of every different system
that it runs on.</p><p>Loading via the Windows NT ARC console is interesting. On
Alpha, Windows NT runs in &ldquo;super paged&rdquo; mode, which does not
support KSEG addressing&mdash;which is unfortunately exactly what Linux
needs for fully 64-bit operations. However, all PALcode
implementations must support the &ldquo;Swap Pal&rdquo; call, and this allows
you to change from one mode to another. The Windows NT ARC console
has within it the notion of running images and providing services
to them so long as they are built to run in the appropriate
addressing mode and run at a safe place in memory.</p><p>Thus, the Windows NT OS loader is in fact an executable image
which gets loaded in order to load Windows NT using the appropriate
call backs. I have written a very simple OS loader whose only
function is to load Milo, which in turn loads Linux. It is this
simple loader which makes the &ldquo;Swap Pal&rdquo; call which causes control
to be passed to Milo and KSEG addressing turned on. From then on,
Milo operates exactly as before with the addition that it can
execute commands passed via the [cw]OSLOADOPTIONS[ecw] environment
variable for this boot option, and thus boot directly without
pausing at the Milo prompt.</p><p>I have tried to eliminate this need for an image that is
built under the Windows NT firmware development tree; unfortunately
this is not possible, so I have kept the functionality of this part
as minimal as possible.</p><p>Of course, loading Milo via the Windows NT ARC console is one
way to get Milo running so that Milo can run the flash update
utility to put itself into flash. Alternatively, it can be a way of
running either operating system without one interfering with the
other.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1034580.0x112d580"></a>The Future</h2></div></div><p>Milo is in its infancy and I hope to see the Linux community
add into it what they need. After all, that is part of the
attraction of Linux itself&mdash;a community of able, enthusiastic
programmers adding to the effort.</p></div></div>
