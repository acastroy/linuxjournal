    Installing Linux on a machine for the first time is often a
    painful experience. There are a number of useful programs
    and techniques for running Linux on machines which run both
    DOS and Linux, some of which appeared in DOS 5.
    Understanding and using these techniques makes it possible
    to use them under DOSEMU whenever relevant.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x148e580.0x1586558"></a></h2></div></div><p>When machines come from a factory with
DOS pre-installed on them, the hard disks are normally arranged so
the whole disk is the C: drive. This is very inflexible, even if
you only want to run DOS, and unbearable if you also want to run
other operating systems. PC partition tables support the following
configurations (with a total of 4 allowed):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>One primary DOS partition</p></li><li><p>One extended partition (containing a number of
logical partitions)</p></li><li><p>One or more non-DOS partitions (good for
Linux)</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x148e580.0x15868c8"></a>Resizing Your Partitions</h2></div></div><p>In order to run Linux, you typically have to repartition your
disk, which is often a good idea whatever operating system you run
for the following reasons on (DOS or UNIX):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Flexibility</p></li><li><p>Crash resistance Typically, disk problems are
reserved to one logical disk on the media. By having more than one
logical disk on a physical device, if anything goes haywire, it is
reserved to one partition.</p></li><li><p>Control You may not want to allocate your whole
hard disk to any application. Giving sets of applications a
partition limits the amount of disk space they can use. You may get
&ldquo;out of disk space&rdquo; on partitions, but not necessarily for the
whole disk.</p></li></ul></div><p>When you want to repartition your disk, standard procedure
used to be:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Back up to floppies</p></li><li><p>Erase your hard disk</p></li><li><p>Repartition</p></li><li><p>Recover your floppies</p></li></ul></div><p>This may have worked with a few meg to back up, but now PCs
normally come with 200 Mb installed in a Microsoft Windows system,
with little documentation about what's important and what's not.
There is a very clever utility called fips, written by Arno
Schaefer, schaefer@rbg.informatik.th-darmstadt.de. It is kept on
sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/system/Install/fips12.zip.</p><p>fips non-destructively shrinks your primary partition,
leaving all your files in place. You run defrag (an MS-DOS program)
to pack all the files into contiguous sectors and then fips to
shrink your primary partition.</p><p>You can then reboot and create an extended DOS partition
(with the DOS fdisk program), and use Linux to create Linux
partitions (with the Linux fdisk program). fips is a wonderful tool
that solves a very real problem. Please read the instructions
carefully before using it; any tool which writes your partition
table, like fdisk, should be used with caution.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>N.B.:</b></span> Be very careful using
fdisk. Don't do anything destructive to your media (i.e mkfs or
format from DOS) until you are sure DOS and Linux agree on where
the partitions are. I've noticed very &ldquo;unnice&rdquo; features with the
DOS fdisk program&mdash;it read the free space as 100 Mb (which was
correct), but when I allowed it to make a partition with all the
free space, it made a 350 Mb partition (very naughty!)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x148e580.0x1587160"></a>Using Extended Partitions</h2></div></div><p>Extended partitions are a way around the 4 partition limit on
a physical disk. An extended partition can serve as a container for
more partitions, which can be DOS, Linux (native or swap) or any
other type. Remember, non-DOS partitions need to be made in a
non-DOS version of fdisk. Extended partitions are handy for
generating more than the 4 partitions normally found. I have never
seen a good discussion of adding swap space to a system&mdash;a good
way is using extended partitions.</p><p>Extended partitions are a good idea&mdash;for running DOS. Each
logical partition in the extended partition is given a letter by
DOS (i.e. D:, E: , F:). Each of these drives can then be formatted
and used under DOS. I use an application called join, which as of
DOS 6 is no longer distributed with DOS, but you can still get a
copy via ftp from ftp.microsoft.com in
/peropsys/msdos/public/supplmnt/. join essentially allows you to
&ldquo;mount drives&rdquo; so you have a single hierarchical tree (like
Linux).</p><p>For instance, I might configure a system with drive D: for
personal stuff and E: for djgpp, a port of the GNU C compiler to
DOS. Then, in my root directory on my C drive I create directories
for \marty, \gnu, and in my autoexec.bat, I have:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
join d: \marty
join e: \gnu
</pre><p>so that I don't have to deal with drive letters. I also join
A: to \a, so my floppy disks appears on the tree. But if you do
something like this you'll break the DOS format program and almost
every DOS install/setup program for commercial software. It seems
that they can't deal with anything except A:.</p><p>Unfortunately, you can't use join with network drives. More
on this later when we talk about DOSEMU.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x148e580.0x1587420"></a>Using loadlin and config.sys</h2></div></div><p>I found it effective to use loadlin, a DOS-based loader; this
has the distinct advantage of always booting a working system
before running Linux. My experience with LILO has been if you don't
do it right, your system is only useful as a paper weight. In my
MS-DOS config.sys, I take advantage of the menus, and the result is
shown in Listing 1.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
menuitem=dos
menuitem=simple.dos
menuitem=linux.1.2.8
menuitem=scandisk
menudefault=linux.1.2.8,5

[linux.1.2.8]
SHELL=C:\loadlin\loadlin.exe \loadlin\zimage.128 root=/dev/hdc2 -v ro

[simple.dos]

[dos]
DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICEHIGH=C:\MAGICS20\CDIFINIT.SYS /T:X
DEVICEHIGH=C:\MTM\MTMCDAI.SYS /D:MTMIDE01
DEVICEHIGH /L:2,12048 =C:\DOS\SETVER.EXE
DOS=HIGH
STACKS=9,256

[scandisk]
SHELL=c:\dos\scandisk.exe /all /checkonly
</pre><p>I boot Linux with a delay of 5 seconds, the advantage being
that the system can always boot DOS and will work in some capacity.
I find this preferable to using LILO and modifying the master boot
record on your hard disk (if you do anything wrong, you need to
boot from floppy to recover).</p><p>One can easily select several kernels and/or configurations
from the command line. Using loadlin, you have to make a compressed
kernel (make zImage), and then put it on a DOS partition. I find
this strategy effective even when installing Linux the first time
(instead of dealing with a boot and root floppy, the system can
boot the kernel with only a root floppy needed). You can easily add
to the menu to have several different kernels to boot from.
Remember, you can use the <span   class="bold"><b>rdev</b></span>
utility to build defaults (like the root device) into the
kernel.</p><p>In your autoexec.bat you can use the strategy:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
goto %config%

:simple.dos
PATH=C:\marty\bin;C:\gnu\bin;C:\dos;C:\
goto end

:dos
SET SOUND16=C:\MAGICS20
C:\MAGICS20\SNDINIT /b
SET BLASTER=A220 I7 D1 T4
C:\DOS\SMARTDRV.EXE 512 512 /C
C:\DOS\IMOUSE.COM
PROMPT $p$g
SET PATH=c:\gnu\bin;C:\MARTY\BIN;C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS;

SET TEMP=C:\DOS
JOIN d: \marty
JOIN f: \gnu
goto end

:end
</pre><p>The <b  >simple.dos</b> setting is conceptually the
same as booting Linux in single user mode. I find it very useful
for debugging a DOS system. If you want, you can add config.sys
menu entries to boot different kernels, boot Linux in single user
mode, boot Linux from floppies, etc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x148e580.0x15877e8"></a>The UMSDOS File System</h2></div></div><p>In the standard Linux kernel configuration, the UMSDOS file
system isn't enabled. UMSDOS has a number of major advantages if
you need file systems to be shared between Linux and DOS. It
retains full Unix semantics, so you don't have to always be
handicapped by DOS problems such as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>lack of links</p></li><li><p>restrictions of 8+3 file naming conventions</p></li><li><p>restrictions of characters in file names</p></li><li><p>one date (instead of access/change/modify
time)</p></li><li><p>lack of owner/groups</p></li></ul></div><p>Using UMSDOS you can take advantage of a file system shared
between DOS and Linux, with the appearance of being a Linux file
system when you run Linux. If you want files to be portable between
MS-DOS and Linux, restrict yourself to DOS filenames (8+3
characters). Don't use links if you want the files to appear under
DOS. With a Linux file system, it's easy do things like create
&ldquo;dot files&rdquo;, do <b  >gzip-r</b> on trees, and create
links and backup files. Any file is readable in MS-DOS; however, if
you don't conform to the MS-DOS file naming conventions, files are
&ldquo;munged&rdquo; (that is, their names are squeezed to fit within the 8+3
namespace). This munging is similar to what happens in mfs; those
who use PC-NFS are probably familiar with this.</p><p>When you start running the UMSDOS file systems, remember to
run the application called umssync, which creates consistency
between the <b  >--linux-.---</b> files and the directory
contents. You can have problems if you add or delete files under
DOS without Linux knowing about it. Call umssync from
/etc/rc.d/rc.local or /etc/rc.d/rc.M after the mount takes place,
and this shouldn't be a problem.</p><p>I've noticed a problem in UMSDOS files systems&mdash;the mount
points are owned by root, only writable by root, and the date is
the beginning of the epoch. A simple workaround is after mounting,
do chown/chmod to the mount points as appropriate (in your
/etc/rc.d/rc.local file. Also, I find it useful to occasionally run
scandisk from DOS (notice the scandisk target in
config.sys).</p><p>There is a performance penalty for DOS and UMSDOS file
systems compared to normal ext2. The penalty becomes severe if you
have several hundred files in a single directory (when you do an
ls, get a cup of coffee). What I've noticed is sequential I/O (with
a tester called Bonnie) is marginally faster on ext2 than
UMSDOS.</p><p>But UMSDOS is ideal if you're doing work with DOSEMU. You put
DOS files on UMSDOS partitions, and you can easily access them from
DOS, DOSEMU or Linux. If they keep within the DOS file system
bounds of 8+3 characters, they look the same on both DOS and Linux.
UMSDOS partitions provide a big advantage when sharing files with
DOS (much more so then the MSDOS file system, since it treats Linux
files as Linux files), but performance has to be watched.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x148e580.0x157e7b0"></a>DOSEMU's View of File Systems</h2></div></div><p>DOSEMU can access files in several different ways, which
integrate with DOS and Linux in different ways. The methods
are:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">image</span></dt><dd><p>A file which is arranged to look like a DOS hard
disk. It is a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; hard disk stored in a file.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">partition</span></dt><dd><p>Direct access to an MS-DOS partition. If the
partition is also being used on Linux, it should not be writable.
Be aware that you can use mounted partitions as DOSEMU file
systems, which can destroy the file system. It is safest if they
are both used readonly; if you want to make them writable you
should only make one of them writable at a time. In addition, if
the DOS partition is writable from DOSEMU, multiple DOSEMU sessions
can cause the same kinds of filesystem destruction.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">whole disk</span></dt><dd><p>Use the whole disk directly. Be vary careful with
this. When used, it is useful to set it [cw]readonly[ecw].</p></dd><dt><span class="term">redirected access Access any Linux directory
via a redirector. This is extremely</span></dt><dd><p>interesting&mdash;read on to learn more about
this.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Typically, DOSEMU boots off a small image file (a specially
constructed file which appears to DOSEMU like a hard disk, with its
own file system and master boot record). Floppy disks are treated
like conventional floppy disks. DOSEMU can read them&mdash;and you need
a bootable MSDOS floppy to start the process. To start setting up
the virtual hard disk as C: drive, you first boot off the bootable
MSDOS floppy, and then do:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
A&gt;fdisk /mbr
A&gt;sys c:
</pre><p>Then you can boot off the virtual hard disk C:. This is
covered more fully in the DOSEMU documentation.</p><p>The image hard disk is often used just to get DOSEMU going.
You can treat this image as a large virtual hard disk, but the
disadvantage is you can only access this disk from DOSEMU. The
other forms, which will be explained, can all be accessed from
Linux, and MS-DOS partitions can be accessed from raw
MS-DOS.</p><p>DOSEMU supports whole disk access (such as /dev/hdc) and
partition access. I have never used whole disk access and there
doesn't appear to be a good reason to do it. I have, however, used
partition access. Those partitions cannot be mounted by Linux at
the same time, since DOSEMU manipulates the physical partition,
which will confuse the kernel, and potentially destroy the
partition. DOSEMU needs to have access to the physical partitions
(you have to make sure you have the permission to read and
write).</p><p>The most interesting method I've found is the redirector.
This allows you to treat a Linux file system as a network drive. If
you redirect the root of your Linux file system, you can easily
access all your linux files in DOSEMU. If you have NFS mounts or an
auto mounter running, you can even traverse to other machines
seamlessly. Note that everything it finds it must convert to an 8+3
MS-DOS namespace.</p><p>It works well if no munging is necessary. However, you may
see this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
F:\dir a*

 Volume in drive F is s2/dist/X11
 Directory of F:\

ARCH                       05-26-95   1:01a

arena-96.tar.gz  arena.tar
</pre><p>Most of the time you can figure out what is meant. I've
noticed some problems identifying files which are spelled the same
way except for the case of some characters. On Unix they're
distinct, but DOS has no notion of case in file names (you will
have a problem with makefile and Makefile, for instance).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x148e580.0x157f258"></a>Booting DOSEMU on Linux</h2></div></div><p>You shouldn't do much on your virtual hard disk beyond
booting. I found it effective to have a directory ~/dos. My
config.sys on the virtual hard disk looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# make sure we support ems
devicehigh=c:\ems.sys
# the last drive is m, it can range up to z:
# the default is f:
lastdrive=m
FILES=40
SWITCHES=/f
# make a copy of c: drive on l:
install=c:\subst.exe l: c:\
# this is the fun part
# change the concept of c: drive
install=c:\lredir.exe  c: LINUX\fs&gt;{home}\dos
</pre><p>The last few lines are the most interesting. I'm making the
virtual hard disk accessible to dosemu through the L: drive. If you
want to &ldquo;lock down&rdquo; the virtual hard disk, you make the file
readonly with the <span   class="bold"><b>chmod</b></span> command.
Then, continue booting from the user's ~/dos directory (where an
autoexec.bat is expected). This means that autoexec.bat is just a
regular Linux file. You can edit it with any Linux editor, but you
have to remember to put <b  >\r</b> at the end of each
line (that's a control-M character; in vi do</p><p><b  >control-v-m</b>,</p><p>in Emacs do control-q-m). In my autoexec.bat I have:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
lredir f: linux\fs\${PWD}
lredir e: linux\fs\
set PATH=e:\dos\gnu\bin;e:\dos\c\dos;c:\;c:\bin
f:
</pre><p>The syntax <b  >${...}</b> allows environment
variables to be substituted. PWD is the current working directory.
Bash doesn't normally export it for you; I explicitly add</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export PWD
</pre><p>to my .bashrc file.</p><p>I just map the F: drive to my current working directory. This
is very convenient, because when I'm working with DOS files on
Linux, I can start up DOSEMU wherever I am at the moment.</p><p>I map my entire filesystem to E:. This makes almost any file
accessible under Linux also accessible under DOSEMU. This includes
NFS files.</p><p>Some programs have a problem with a redirector, since it acts
as a network drive. For these programs, you need to use either
partition access, image access or a ram disk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x148e580.0x157f888"></a>Booting from the Installed DOS System and
Win95</h2></div></div><p>Extending the above scenario further, we can actually boot
from a DOS hard disk using</p><pre     class="programlisting">
disk { wholedisk "/dev/hda" readonly }
</pre><p>This has a number of advantages&mdash;primarily the virtual hard
disk does not have to be created and maintained (note the virtual
hard disk is only readable within DOSEMU, making maintenance
cumbersome). DOSEMU allows you to select the extension for the
system files (config.sys and autoexec.bat) either in the
configuration file (using EmuSys or EmuBat) or from the environment
(using AUTOEXEC and CONFIG). This boot disk isn't writable, so
switch to a writable C: drive with lredir.</p><p>I typically have a config.sys file for DOSEMU called
config.emu. In it I just change the C: drive (from the virtual hard
disk) to a ~/dos directory, and have an autoexec.bat file there. I
also have links to commonly used DOS programs (i.e.
command.com).</p><p>Win95 throws some curves into this scheme. I've been using
Win95 since the official release and am favorably impressed with it
(anything could improve on Windows 3.1 problems). Win95 uses the
file MSDOS.SYS to control the boot process as another ASCII
configuration file. In order to activate a config.sys menu to
either boot DOS or Linux, the following works in MSDOS.SYS:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[Options]
Logo=0
BootMulti=1
BootGUI=0
BootDelay=0
</pre><p>In this case, after you run Linux, booting DOSEMU will allow
you to run DOS Version 7.</p><p>You can also run an older DOS (if this was an upgrade) if you
press F4 when it starts booting. But in this case, if you boot
Linux and then start up DOSEMU off the DOS hard disk, the boot
loader gets hopelessly confused, since it shuffles files like
msdos.sys, config.sys, and autoexec.bat between Win95 and an older
DOS system, putting the appropriate file in the appropriate place
for the appropriate DOS (Win95 config files end in .w40, and older
DOS files end in .dos). Obviously, you aren't expected to run
DOSEMU under Linux!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x148e580.0x157fbf8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>I use DOS occasionally, but do a lot of work in MS-DOS since
I'm working on DOSEMU and an alpha djgpp. I have found that you can
do very flexible things with your partitions through extended
partitions, and that Linux treats DOS filesystems quite nicely
(especially UMSDOS).</p><p>I've found cross-development of MS-DOS applications to be
ideal for DOS software development, you can write portable software
and try it on Linux&mdash;then use Linux compilers to generate .EXE
djgpp files and run the djgpp binaries in DOSEMU.</p></div></div>
