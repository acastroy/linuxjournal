    A look at the improvements and functionality of the GNOME 2
    desktop.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11fe500"></a></h2></div></div><p>The GNOME Foundation
(<a href="http://gnome.org" target="_self">gnome.org</a>) released GNOME
version 2.0 last summer and version 2.2 in January 2003. These
releases mark a move toward a standardized desktop and a commitment
to scheduled releases. GNOME has become an excellent choice for
first-time and nontechnical users. &ldquo;With the exception of some
specialized applications, one can be fully productive in business
with the GNOME desktop. That's something that has only occurred
with free software in the last 12 to 18 months&rdquo;, says Tim Ney,
GNOME Foundation executive director. With the improvements made in
GNOME 2, Linux's chances of increasing its market share rose
significantly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11fe660"></a>Changes to GNOME</h2></div></div><p>The transition for GNOME 1.x users to GNOME 2 will involve a
few minor annoyances that can be expected when upgrading a desktop.
Going from one learning curve to another is common in Linux;
however, in upgrading my personal computer to GNOME 2, I was
surprised to realize GNOME 1.4 had given me a certain level of
comfort I did not want disturbed.</p><p>The people at the GNOME Foundation told me they were looking
to streamline the desktop and cut down on the multitude of
choices&mdash;to make workstations simpler and reduce the learning
curves for new users. As a result, many minor applications,
especially redundant ones, have either been eliminated or moved to
a submenu labeled Extras. GNOME 2 also provides a more consistent
look and feel from one program to another, thanks to an improvement
in themes and fonts. &ldquo;We're trying to strike more of a
balance&mdash;setting standards while at the same time keeping the
flexibility of Linux&rdquo;, says Havoc Pennington, GNOME developer and
Foundation board member.</p><p>Despite how content some of us may be with Linux in the
rough, nontechnical users don't always appreciate the struggle. To
compete for larger markets, GNOME has simplified the desktop.
Pennington says, &ldquo;It's not about removing choices but giving you a
default choice to get you started quickly and easily.&rdquo; So, instead
of offering the user five different browsers and three different
word processors, there's one of each. If you don't like the ones
picked out for you&mdash;which were designed with the new GNOME 2
libraries&mdash;you can always find the RPM on the Web and load
it.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6469f1.large.jpg"><img src="6469f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. GNOME Desktop</p></div></div>
</p><p>Thanks to a usability study conducted by Seth Nickell of the
GNOME Project, the program menus have been nicely reorganized.
GNOME no longer buries utilities under several layers of submenus
or within other programs. It also does not require the user to make
command-line changes or to edit configuration scripts directly.
Instead, GNOME 2 provides graphical interfaces for just about all
system settings in easy-to-find places under main menus.</p><p>GNOME comes with many applications and utilities. Because I
cannot cover all of them, I review a few key components from each
section to help those new to GNOME get started. Some components are
new to GNOME 2, and others have been included in GNOME for some
time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11fead8"></a>Panels</h2></div></div><p>As is common with some desktop environments, GNOME provides
users with panels for launching and managing programs, as well as
for monitoring their systems. Panels can be placed at the top,
bottom, left and right margins of the desktop. More than one panel
per margin can be set up, and panels can be floating so that they
can be placed anywhere on the desktop. They can be configured to
remain open, to hide automatically, or they can resize themselves
as needed depending on the number of running applications. A panel
also can be set up with a button for extending and retracting the
panel.</p><p>Initially, one panel is set up along the top margin with a
menu for launching programs. Another panel is placed along the
bottom margin with icons for launching each major component of
OpenOffice, which is now the default office suite for GNOME 2. It
also has links to the web browser, Mozilla, and the default e-mail
client, Ximian's Evolution. All things considered, these are good
choices for the average Linux user and especially for nontechnical
users. If you don't like these choices, however, you easily can
remove or add program launchers to the panels. Simply right-click
on an icon and choose Remove from the panel to remove it. To add an
item, right-click on an open section of the panel, select the Add
to panel menu, and pick the application you want to add from one of
the submenus.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11fec38"></a>Workspaces</h2></div></div><p>The bottom panel initially contains a workspace switcher or
pager. This isn't unique to GNOME, but it's a useful component of
the desktop, allowing you to have multiple virtual desktops running
simultaneously. You can open a couple of related applications on
one page and have another page with another set of applications, so
you can switch between them quickly without having to minimize and
maximize. For example, when using a program like The GIMP, which
opens each image and tool in a separate window, it's handy to be
able to switch to another workspace to check for e-mail without
disturbing The GIMP windows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11fed40"></a>Applets</h2></div></div><p>Depending on your computer, certain applets already are
placed on the panels, but several others may be added. By default,
the clock applet is installed. However, the choices for faces are
now limited to a single digital one. The old GNOME provided a
half-dozen or so, including some stylish analog clock faces. For
laptops, a battery monitor applet is placed on the panel. You can
add a dictionary form, a weather report applet, a scrolling marquee
stock ticker, modem indicator lights, an e-mail box notifier, a CD
player and audio volume controls, and a floppy disk
mounter&mdash;something useful for users who don't know the mount
command to save their data.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11fee48"></a>Continuity</h2></div></div><p>One very useful feature of a fully integrated desktop
environment is the ability to copy and paste text between
applications. In recent years, this has been possible in GNOME, but
it was fairly spotty and not very dependable. However, this no
longer seems to be much of a problem. You now can copy from a web
browser to a terminal window running vi to a word processor and so
on. Resolving this bug has greatly added continuity to the GNOME
environment.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6469f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. GNOME 2.2 Really Cleans Up the Fonts
</p></div></div><p>Another continuity achievement is the improvement in screen
fonts. In the past, screen fonts had a jagged look. That's all
changed, says GNOME Release Coordinator Jeff Waugh of Sydney,
Australia:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>With GTK+ 2.0 [used in GNOME 2.0], we gained
Pango, a font layout, rendering and i18n library. But with GTK+ 2.2
[used in GNOME 2.2], it now supports new font configuration
software written by Keith Packard, fontconfig. This really cleans
up the fonts. They span all desktop applications in GNOME because
everything is based on GTK+.</p></blockquote></div><p>The result is a desktop with a consistent, professional look
throughout.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11ff268"></a>Nautilus</h2></div></div><p>An integral part of GNOME is Nautilus, a graphical interface
for managing files and configuring Linux. The simplest way to
access Nautilus is by double-clicking on the Home icon on the
desktop. Nautilus is a comprehensive drag-and-drop file manager.
You can copy and move files by key strokes, by dragging and
dropping a file's icon from one window to another or by
right-clicking on a file's icon and selecting a choice from the
pop-up menu. The pop-up menu also provides a screen for modifying
permissions and ownerships. You also can now add graphical markers
to icons associated with specific files to earmark them (e.g.,
important or personal).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6469f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Emblems Screenshot
</p></div></div><p>If, like me, you've accumulated hundreds of data files on
your computer, within dozens of directories going down several
levels, you'll appreciate Nautilus' bookmark feature. Simply browse
your way to a directory you use often, click on the Bookmarks
pull-down menu and select Add Bookmark. The next time you want to
get to that directory, click on the icon created for it in the
Bookmarks menu and you're there.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11ff580"></a>Configuring</h2></div></div><p>Nautilus is also a graphical interface for configuring both
GNOME and the underlying OS. You can reach the GNOME utilities and
configuration programs through the menus or by clicking on the
Nautilus pull-down menu labeled Go and choosing Start Here. A
window then opens with four program group icons that read,
Applications, Preferences, Server Settings and System Settings.
Incidentally, the desktop had an icon for it in version 1.4, but it
has been replaced by the configuration menus.</p><p>The Applications menu group connects to all the applications
that appear in the main menu on the menu panel. Here you can launch
programs or add application launchers to the menus. However, this
doesn't work in version 2.0, which was shipped with Red Hat 8.0. It
has been fixed in version 2.2.</p><p>Under the Preferences menu group, you can modify a variety of
settings such as the background, the default font and the mouse
settings. You can pick a different theme or change the focus
behavior of windows here. Those who are more keyboard- than
mouse-prone will appreciate the Keyboard Shortcuts utility. With it
you can create key combinations to do things like open favorite
programs or switch workspaces. Many are already set up in this
utility, but they can be modified.</p><p>The Server Settings program group provides links to utilities
for configuring server applications such as Apache's web service.
This program group will have more or fewer utilities depending on
what's installed on a system. At a minimum, though, there is an
interface to the xinetd services located in the /etc/rc.d/init.d
directory. These are the same system services that are accessible
from the old setup program.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6469f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Nautilus System Settings
</p></div></div><p>The System Settings program group has all the good stuff for
configuring a computer. Many of these utilities are coming from Red
Hat but have been developed for GNOME. This includes an interface
for date and time and a utility for changing the video display
settings. Incidentally, this is now where you adjust your X
configuration; it's no longer part of the setup program, in case
you were frustrated not to find the X configurator there. With
version 2.2, support for multiheaded display with multiple video
cards and monitors was simplified. Waugh says, &ldquo;Nautilus will
manage both desktops with the same process, and panels will be able
to display on both heads, etc. There's even support for migrating
applications between displays and such.&rdquo;</p><p>Clicking on the Network icon in the System Settings window
will open a utility (<span   class="bold"><b>neat</b></span>) for
configuring network cards and the hosts file. The printer utility
(<span   class="bold"><b>printconf-gui</b></span>) allows the user to
add printers, set print drivers and restart the printer
d&aelig;mon.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11ffaa8"></a>Accessibility</h2></div></div><p>The improvement in GNOME 2 that will most directly affect
increasing free software's desktop market share is accessibility
for people with disabilities. &ldquo;The US government can now use
open-source desktop solutions, which wasn't going to happen
otherwise because of government regulations&rdquo;, says Pennington. He
adds:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It also benefits normal users in a lot of ways.
For instance, one of the accessibility requirements is full
keyboard navigation [mentioned above]. You can do just about
anything from the keyboard now. Also, themes have been enhanced
because of accessibility regulations: color contrasts, default font
size and so on.</p></blockquote></div><p>With the accessibility barrier eliminated, Linux's target
market has been expanded greatly, and options for all users have
been improved in the process. Pennington says, &ldquo;Sun Microsystems
first brought accessibility to GNOME's attention. It was a huge
project involving a couple years of work and about 20 developers.
We're very excited about it and we're proud of what has been
accomplished.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11ffcb8"></a>Menus and Applications</h2></div></div><p>Besides the system configuration menus mentioned above, in
the main menu there are several other menus for launching
applications. A menu labeled Accessories includes a calculator, a
dictionary and a simple text editor
(<span   class="bold"><b>gedit</b></span>). Under the menu labeled
Office, OpenOffice is included along with Dia for creating
organizational charts and flowcharts, along with MrProject for
project management. The Graphics menu provides links to The GIMP
and a few other image manipulation programs. The Games menu
includes many games, some of which utilize the GNOME libraries: a
couple solitaire games, a few popular line-up-the-dots games, a
GNOME version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Minefield</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mahjongg</em></span> and several others. I can't list all
of the applications installed by default, but as you can see,
streamlining the GNOME menus did not short-change the user.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6469f5.large.jpg"><img src="6469f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 5. Ximian Evolution</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11f6968"></a>Ximian Evolution</h2></div></div><p>Probably the best application that makes use of the GNOME
libraries is Ximian's e-mail client, Evolution. It was rated by
<i  >Linux Journal</i> in November 2002 as one of
readers' favorite e-mail clients available for Linux. Evolution
allows for multiple POP and IMAP accounts. It comes with e-mail
filtering, spell checking and the ability to attach binary files.
Although it works with standard POP and IMAP servers as is, with
the addition of Ximian's proprietary Connector, users can connect
to a Microsoft Exchange server for group address books and
appointment planning&mdash;an important compatibility component.</p><p>One feature of Evolution that other e-mail programs don't
have is virtual folders. &ldquo;V-Folders allow the user more
flexibility and ease of organizing e-mails&mdash;they're contextual
views of your messages. That is something completely unique to
Evolution&rdquo;, says Christine McLellan, senior product manager for
Evolution. For example, in addition to a view of e-mail shown in
the inbox in which messages can be sorted by date, subject or
sender, a virtual folder is provided that shows only the unread
messages. This virtual folder can make working through new messages
quick and easy. Virtual folders also can be set up for messages
with certain subjects or from certain people. A word of caution
though, if you delete a message in a virtual folder, it's deleted
from all folders at the same time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1106580.0x11f6b20"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The GNOME Foundation has made fabulous improvements to the
desktop, and they have achieved much-needed consistency and
stability with GNOME 2. &ldquo;None of this would have happened without
our developers, hundreds of which aren't paid by GNOME and are not
sponsored by their employers&rdquo;, says Ney. At this point, the
Foundation's plans are to release stable updates every six months,
with the next one (v. 2.4) scheduled for June 2003. Version 2.4
will include a Nautilus drag-and-drop CD burner function and more
improvements to fonts. With their commitment to scheduled
improvements to the desktop, GNOME has become a desktop environment
that can be relied on by businesses, users and developers.</p></div></div>
