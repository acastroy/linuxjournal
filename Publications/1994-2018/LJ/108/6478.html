Book Review: <span  class="emphasis"><em>Hacker's Delight</em></span> by Henry S.
Warren, Jr.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14c1580.0x15b9608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Boston, Pearson Education, Inc.,
2003</p><p>ISBN: 0-201-91465-4</p><p>$39.99 US (hardcover)</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Hacker's Delight</em></span> is a treasure trove for
learning how to write efficient code. Over the course of 16
chapters and two appendices, fiendishly clever algorithms are
illustrated through numerous examples coded in C and with graphics,
along with the mathematical theory that supports the
techniques.</p><p>The introduction describes an instruction set and execution
efficiency model on which the rest of the work is based. This
provides a useful means for assessing computational efficiency on
most modern computers. Then the stage is set for a chapter about
many little issues surrounding bit-level representation. Next, a
chapter each is provided for algorithms involving power-of-two
boundaries and arithmetic bounds.</p><p>Efficient techniques for bit-level manipulations, such as
counting the bits in a word, are described in the next three
chapters, and the next four chapters form an &eacute;tude about
some key arithmetic operators and functions, including efficient
multiplication and two kinds of integer division. A chapter follows
covering algorithms for computing key elementary functions on
integers. This includes logarithms, exponentials, plus square and
cube roots.</p><p>In some specialized applications, alternative representations
for the meaning of the bits can offer an advantage. Unusual number
system bases and Gray codes are described in detail in two
chapters. Gray codes, for instance, are useful for enumerating
states in finite-state machines where only one bit changes per
state transition.</p><p>One chapter provides an algorithmic glimpse on a variant of
the Peano curve called the Hilbert curve, which is an interesting
related space-filling curve. The Hilbert curve is amenable to
recursive algorithms and has some bit-level computational
advantages for representing spatial distances in coordinates. These
algorithms find usefulness in image processing, rendering and
compression.</p><p>A nice summary of IEEE Std 754-1985 floating-point arithmetic
includes a procedure for comparing floating-point numbers using
only integer operations, formulas for computing the probability
density function for the number of leading digits in select ranges
of representable numbers and a handy table of miscellaneous number
values represented in hex for both single- and double-precision
floating point.</p><p>The last chapter provides algorithms for computing prime
numbers, using Willan's and Wormell's Formulas. Primes have uses in
hashing algorithms and cryptography, among other things.</p><p>Two appendices provide 4-bit arithmetic tables and a more
detailed description of Newton's Method for function approximation.
The arithmetic tables are a handy way to envision the work done in
algorithmic steps that are a fraction of a typical word length. The
bibliography also is rich, listing many original papers for
arithmetic, number theory and the techniques embellished within the
book.</p><p>You can employ these techniques to attain mastery of some
important inner-loop code, while enjoying the beauty of arithmetic
algorithms. The author is a veteran of IBM, and his programming
tricks are born of experience across four decades, from the IBM 704
through the PowerPC. The book is a wonderful collection of
techniques for any programmer looking to improve efficiency for key
algorithms in areas such as compiler development, databases,
arithmetic for image and signal processing, and code
libraries.</p><p>&mdash;Michael Baxter</p></div></div>
