    Setting up rsync modules at the filesystem level and making

server for anonymous access. Listing 1 shows the sample rsyncd.conf
file from last month, illustrating some options particularly useful
for tightening security. Returning to our example, here's a word
about setting up rsync modules (directories) at the filesystem
level. The guidelines for doing this are the same as those for
anonymous FTP chroot environments. The only exception is that no
system binaries or configuration files need to be copied inside
them for chroot purposes, as is the case with some FTP servers.
</p><p><a href="6508l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Sample rsyncd.conf
File</a></p><p>The rsync configuration file needs only a little
customization of paths and allowed hosts to start serving files to
anonymous users. But that's a pretty narrow offering. How about
accepting anonymous uploads and adding a module for authenticated
users? Listing 2 outlines how to do both.</p><p><a href="6508l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Additional rsyncd.conf
Modules</a></p><p>First, we have a module called incoming, whose path is
/home/incoming. The guidelines for publicly writable directories
(see &ldquo;Tips for Securing Anonymous FTP&rdquo; in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Building
Secure Servers with Linux</em></span>) apply, but with one important
difference: for anonymous rsync, this directory must be
world-executable as well as world-writable, that is, mode 0733. If
it isn't set this way, file uploads fail without any error being
returned to the client or logged on the server.</p><p>Some tips that apply for configuring FTP are to watch this
directory closely for abuse and never make it or its contents
world-readable. Also, move uploaded files out of it and into a
nonworld-accessible part of the filesystem as soon as possible,
perhaps with a cron job.</p><p>The only new option in the [incoming] block is transfer
logging. This causes rsync to log more verbosely when actual file
transfers are attempted. By default, this option has a value of no.
In addition, the familiar option read-only has been set to no,
overriding its global setting of yes. No similar option exists for
telling rsync this directory is writable; this is determined by the
directory's actual permissions.</p><p>The second part of the example defines a restricted-access
module named Audiofreakz. There are three new options to discuss
here. The first option, list, determines whether this module should
be listed when remote users request a list of the server's
available modules. Its default value is yes.</p><p>The other two new options, auth users and secrets file,
define how prospective clients should be authenticated. rsync's
authentication mechanism, available only when run in d&aelig;mon
mode, is based on a reasonably strong 128-bit MD5
challenge-response scheme. This is superior to standard FTP
authentication for two reasons. First, passwords are not
transmitted over the network and therefore are not subject to
eavesdropping attacks. Brute-force hash-generation attacks against
the server are theoretically feasible, however.</p><p>Second, rsync doesn't use the system's user credentials; it
has its own file of user name-password combinations. This file is
used only by rsync and is not linked or related in any way to
/etc/passwd or /etc/shadow. Thus, even if an rsync login session is
somehow compromised, no user's system account is directly
threatened or compromised unless you've made some poor choices
regarding which directories to make available using rsync or when
setting those directories' permissions.</p><p>Like FTP, however, data transfers themselves are unencrypted.
At best, rsync authentication validates the identities of users,
but it does not ensure data integrity or privacy against
eavesdroppers. To achieve those goals you must run it over either
SSH or Stunnel.</p><p>The secrets file option specifies the path and name of the
file containing rsync user name-password combinations. By
convention, /etc/rsyncd.secrets commonly is used, but the file may
have practically any name or location&mdash;it needn't end, for example,
with the suffix .secrets. This option also has no default value; if
you wish to use auth users, you also must define secrets file. This
example shows the contents of a sample secrets file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
watt:shyneePAT3
bell:d1ngplunkB00M!
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x125d580.0x1355a28"></a>Contents of a Sample /etc/rsyncd.secrets
File</h2></div></div><p>The auth users option in Listing 2 defines which users, among
those listed in the secrets file, may have access to the module.
All clients who attempt to connect to this module, assuming they
pass any applicable hosts allow and hosts deny ACLs, are prompted
for a user name and password. Remember to set the permissions of
the applicable files and directories carefully, because these
ultimately determine what authorized users may do once they've
connected. If auth users is not set, users are not required to
authenticate, and the module is available over anonymous rsync.
This is rsync's default behavior in d&aelig;mon mode.</p><p>And that is most of what you need to know to set up both
anonymous and authenticated rsync services. See the rsync(8) and
rsyncd.conf(5) man pages for full lists of command-line and
configuration-file options, including a couple I haven't covered
here that can be used to customize log messages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x125d580.0x1355b88"></a>Using rsync to Connect to an rsync
Server</h2></div></div><p>Lest I forget, I haven't explained how to connect to an rsync
server as a client. This is a simple matter of syntax; when
specifying the remote host, use a double colon rather than a single
colon and use a path relative to the desired module, not an
absolute path.</p><p>For instance, to revisit the scenario in last month's
example, in which the client system is called near and the remote
system is called far, suppose you wish to retrieve the file
newstuff.tgz and far is running rsync in d&aelig;mon mode. Suppose
further that you can't remember the name of the module on far in
which new files are stored. First, you can query far for a list of
its available modules, as shown below:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[root@near darthelm ]# rsync far::
public          Nobody home but us tarballs
incoming        You can put, but you can't take
</pre><p>(Not coincidentally, these are the same modules we set up in
this month's examples; as I predicted in the previous section, the
module Audiofreakz is omitted.) The directory you need is named
public. Assuming you're right, the command to copy newstuff.tgz to
your current working directory would look like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[yodeldiva@near ~]# rsync far::public/newstuff.tgz .
</pre>


Both the double colon and the path format differ from SSH mode.
Whereas SSH expects an absolute path after the colon, the rsync
d&aelig;mon expects a module name, which acts as the &ldquo;root&rdquo; of
the file's path. To illustrate, let's look at the same command
using SSH mode:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[yodeldiva@near ~]# rsync -e ssh \
far:/home/public_rsync/newstuff.tgz .
</pre>


These two aren't exactly equivalent, of course; whereas the rsync
d&aelig;mon process on far is configured to serve files in this
directory to anonymous users (i.e., without authentication), SSH
always requires authentication (although this can be automated
using null-passphrase RSA or DSA keys, described in Chapter 4 of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Secure Servers with Linux</em></span>). But it
does show the difference between how paths are handled.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x125d580.0x1355ea0"></a>Tunneling rsync with Stunnel</h2></div></div><p>The last rsync usage I'll mention is the combination of
rsync, running in d&aelig;mon mode, with Stunnel. Stunnel is a
general-purpose TLS or SSL wrapper that can be used to encapsulate
any simple TCP transaction in an encrypted and optionally
X.509-certificate-authenticated session. Although rsync gains
encryption when you run it in SSH mode, it loses its d&aelig;mon
features, most notably anonymous rsync. Using Stunnel gives you
encryption as good as SSH's, while still supporting anonymous
transactions.</p><p><a href="6508s1.html" target="_self">What About Recursion?</a></p><p>Stunnel is covered in-depth in Chapter 5 of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Secure Servers with Linux</em></span>, using
rsync in most examples. Suffice it to say that this method involves
the following steps on the server side:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Configure rsyncd.conf as you normally would.</p></li><li><p>Invoke rsync with the --port option, specifying
some port other than 873 (e.g., <b  >rsync --daemon
--port=8730</b>).</p></li><li><p>Set up a Stunnel listener on TCP port 873 to
forward all incoming connections on TCP 873 to the local TCP port
specified in the previous step.</p></li><li><p>If you don't want anybody to connect &ldquo;in the
clear&rdquo;, configure hosts.allow to block nonlocal connections to the
port specified in Step 2. In addition, or instead, you can
configure iptables to do the same thing.</p></li></ol></div><p>On the client side, the procedure is as follows:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>As root, set up a Stunnel listener on TCP port 873
(assuming you don't have an rsync server on the local system
already using it), which forwards all incoming connections on TCP
873 to TCP port 873 on the remote server.</p></li><li><p>When you wish to connect to the remote server,
specify localhost as the remote server's name. The local Stunnel
process now opens a connection to the server and forwards your
rsync packets to the remote Stunnel process. The remote Stunnel
process decrypts your rsync packets and delivers them to the remote
rsync d&aelig;mon. Reply packets, naturally, are sent back through
the same encrypted connection.</p></li></ol></div>

As you can see, rsync itself isn't configured much differently in
this scenario than anonymous rsync would be&mdash;most of the work is in
setting up Stunnel forwarders.
