Gtk-Perl Flash Cards:

</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f1580.0x23e93a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Flash cards have always been a good way
to go through questions. You get the question, provide a response
and see if it's correct. That's the theory behind this little
application. You can classify the question as difficult or easy,
put as many as you'd like in the data file and quiz yourself. The
application provides a way to keep track of the number of correct
and incorrect responses, total number of questions, a button to
randomize the next question and more. Requires: Perl, Perl module
Gtk.</p><p>&mdash;David A. Bandel</p><p>Checkbot:
<a href="http://degraaff.org/checkbot" target="_self">degraaff.org/checkbot</a></p><p>This is a simple, lightweight web checker. If you run it with
the --match option and match your domain name, it will not wander
off on all the sites you might be linked to. You can have it mail
the results or simply watch it traverse your site picking up the
URLs. No more broken links, no matter how complex the site&mdash;at
least none you don't know about. Requires: Perl, Perl modules
File::Basename and LWP.</p><p>&mdash;David A. Bandel</p><p>Dbmail:
<a href="http://www.dbmail.org" target="_self">www.dbmail.org</a></p><p>If you're running a large mail server with thousands of
users, Dbmail may be helpful. Users and mail are all stored in an
SQL database; system users do not need to be created. The Dbmail
program comes not only with dbmail-smtp, a receive-only SMTP
d&aelig;mon (you'll still need sendmail or another MTA for outgoing
mail), but also with dbmail-pop3d, a pop3 server, and dbmail-imapd,
an IMAP d&aelig;mon. Instructions for setup are sketchy, so you'll
need to figure it out for yourself. Fortunately, that's not too
hard to do. Configuration includes things like POP or IMAP before
SMTP. Requires: PostgreSQL or MySQL, libssl, libcrypto,
glibc.</p><p>&mdash;David A. Bandel</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22f1580.0x23e97c0"></a>diff -u: What's New in Kernel
Development</h2></div></div><p>In spite of the October 31, 2002 feature-freeze, developers
continue to hack on their favorite projects. December saw a number
of such developments, some weirder than others. In the POSIX realm,
<span   class="bold"><b>Krzysztof Benedyczak</b></span> and others
did some work on implementing <span   class="bold"><b>POSIX message
queues</b></span> to allow processes to communicate more directly
with each other. Linux always has maintained a love/hate
relationship with POSIX (and other official standards), sticking to
the principle that bad ideas should be avoided whether they have an
official seal or not. Message queues have not been particularly
controversial in the Linux arena, but the UNIX world at large has
not always agreed on the proper public interfaces for them. So
whatever the ultimate Linux message-queue implementation, there
will be permanent issues surrounding attempts to port any
applications that use the feature.</p><p>Drivers for new hardware are churned out constantly,
development series or no. December saw several new drivers for
<span   class="bold"><b>Via cards</b></span> (the 8633 AGP and 8233
onboard sound card) from <span   class="bold"><b>Nathaniel
Russell</b></span> and a framebuffer driver for the
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel 810 and 815</b></span> graphics chips
from Antonino Daplas. Overall the framebuffer code did not fare
spectacularly well in December, though many patches and
advancements were made. Part of the problem is the basic
framebuffer design makes assumptions that simply are not true for
certain hardware, and the design issues are hard to correct because
a lot of user-space code relies on the existing implementation. But
<span   class="bold"><b>James Simmons</b></span> has been quite
active in addressing the issues that can be addressed, and a lot of
work by him and others will be in the 2.6 framebuffer code,
including some fancy new APIs.</p><p>A whole new architecture saw the light of day in December.
After a month's intense labor, <span   class="bold"><b>Andrey
Panin</b></span> ported Linux to the <span   class="bold"><b>SGI
Visual Workstation</b></span>. Some might say, as
<span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> did when Andrey announced
his work, that such an effort belonged truly in the land of
dementia. After all, the VISWS was apparently a flash in the pan,
appearing briefly a few years ago and then dropping off the map.
But Alan still applied the patch.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Intel's sysenter</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>sysexit</b></span> instructions, introduced
way back with the Pentium II, finally are starting to find support
under Linux. Theoretically, they provide a quick way to perform
system calls, but in practice it proves difficult to find an
implementation that doesn't sacrifice too much of the speed the
instructions are intended to save. A lot of progress was made in
December, but this is all quite invasive work, and as Alan Cox has
said, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> appears to be
&ldquo;doing the slow slide into a second round of development work
again&rdquo;, as was the case with all other development series.</p><p>Speaking of invasive work, it looks as though
<span   class="bold"><b>Andre Hedrick's</b></span> new
<span   class="bold"><b>IDE subsystem</b></span> will be dropped
<span   class="emphasis"><em>en masse</em></span> into the 2.4 kernel. Normally such an
invasive change would be attempted only during a development cycle,
but apparently the old IDE code is too nightmarish to live. News of
the new IDE code's imminent acceptance into 2.4 was greeted with
shouts of jubilation from all sectors. Quite a different reaction
from Linus' decision to drop a new virtual memory subsystem into an
earlier 2.4 kernel.</p><p>In the final months of 2002, some folks decided to set up a
<span   class="bold"><b>Bugzilla database</b></span> to help bring
2.5 to a successful, stable conclusion as soon as possible. Not all
developers feel that Bugzilla is the best tool for the job,
however. Since the bug database was first set up, it has proven
difficult to use in certain ways. Bugs go unclaimed, and developers
have trouble finding references to bugs in their areas of interest.
In light of this, <span   class="bold"><b>John Bradford</b></span>
decided to start from scratch and implement an entirely new
bug-tracking system, designed specifically for the Linux kernel. He
chose to focus on automating much of the search facility and
enhancing the organization and presentation of bugs to streamline
the ability to find bug reports in any particular area of interest.
That said, the existing Bugzilla database has its adherents, and as
of the end of December 2002, John still had not put together a
fully usable replacement.</p><p>&mdash;Zack Brown</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6555f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

talk about installing a Linux box. Talk about installing a new file
or print server. As long as what you implement does the job and
works reliably, no one will care how it's done as long as it
works.</p><p>&mdash;Craig Sanders, Debian developer and professional system
administrator</p><p>A for-profit software company cannot compete with the
economics of open source&mdash;free is as cheap as it gets. Nor, it
turns out, can it compete with open source's quality testing
process. Though the pace of open-source development can be languid
and tends to create products less functionally rich than their
proprietary counterparts, the stuff gets tested so often and so
brutally by so many different people that most open-source programs
are judged to be more stable and reliable. In a commodity market,
low cost and reliability count more than bells and whistles.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Koch, <span   class="emphasis"><em>CIO Magazine</em></span></p><p>What I've found is that a Linux administrator who knows what
