    How to create a single CD for fast and easy customized
    installation.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x2242608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Installing Linux is a relatively easy
task. However, I was faced with the task of installing it on
multiple machines repeatedly, which is time consuming and prone to
errors. This problem affected our whole group and other groups that
relied on us. So I started using Red Hat Kickstart to automate the
installs. This helped, but there still was room for improvement.
What I ultimately wanted was an automated installation that would
fit on one CD, dynamically partition the hard drives and contain
all of the updated packages. I wanted to be able to start an
installation then walk away from the machine, returning only when
it was done. To accomplish this, I supplemented Kickstart with a
customized version of the Red Hat installation program, Anaconda.
</p><p>Although not officially supported, Red Hat has made available
several tools and documentation to assist in customizing an
installation. I describe a few of the possible ways to do this
here, which should give the reader enough information to get
started.</p><p>The following topics are covered in this article: replacing
packages with updates, reducing the installation size to fit on one
CD, utilizing Kickstart in the custom installation and creating a
custom message screen.</p><p>The reader should have a good understanding of Linux
installations in general. I also assume that no esoteric hardware
is being used, as other customizations may be needed to accommodate
such hardware.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x2242818"></a>Setting Up the Build Machine</h2></div></div><p>The first step is to prepare the build computer. Because the
installer tools are specific to a particular release, the build
computer needs to have the same Red Hat release as the one used on
the target(s). For our example, Red Hat 8.0 is being used. There
are some differences between Red Hat 8.0 and previous versions, and
you need to investigate them if you use a previous version.</p><p>Once the build computer has the correct release installed,
the Anaconda packages need to be installed. These usually are not
installed by default, so they need to be manually installed. They
are located on the second CD of the standard Red Hat distribution
and are named anaconda, anaconda-runtime and anaconda-help
(optional).</p><p>The next step is to create a directory structure where the
installation files will be located. The partition should have
adequate space available, approximately 3GB. The actual location is
based on your preference; for this article, the base directory is
located at /RH80. Under this directory, we create directories for
each of the CDs:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p /RH80/CD{1,2,3}
</pre><p>We are not concerned with the source packages, so CD4 and CD5
are not included.
</p><p>We make an additional directory where we can create the
custom installation:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /RH80/ONE_CD
</pre><p>Now we can copy the contents of the CDs to the respective
directories. Mount the first CD, then issue this command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp -a /mnt/cdrom/* /RH80/CD1/
</pre>


Repeat this step for CD2 and CD3.
</p><p>Copy the contents of the CD directories to the ONE_CD
directory, but hard link them instead of actually copying the
files. This saves space and is quicker:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /RH80
cp -al CD1/* ONE_CD/
cp -al CD{2,3}/RedHat/RPMS/* ONE_CD/RedHat/RPMS/
</pre><p>You'll get an overwrite TRANS.TBL message; you can answer no.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x2242ce8"></a>Selecting the Packages</h2></div></div><p>Next we trim down the contents of the ONE_CD directory so it
fits on one CD. I assume the CD size to be 700MB. I will not go
into detail on how to do this, as the list of files to remove from
the distribution is different from one installation to another.
However, here are some tips for trimming down the
distribution:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Don't include the source RPMs.</p></li><li><p>Remove the dosutils directory, as these will be
automated installs.</p></li><li><p>Remove any unnecessary packages. This can be
complicated, because you need to make sure that the dependencies
are still intact.</p></li></ul></div><p>You should keep a record of the files that were removed. You
can use this list in case you need to back out, and you will need
it later if you edit the comps.xml file.</p><p>For the package selection, I logged to a file all of the base
and core group packages with their dependencies (according to the
comps.xml file). In order to find this information, I used the
script getGroupPkgs.py (see Resources):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /RH80/ONE_CD/RedHat/base
getGroupPkgs.py comps.xml &gt; /RH80/pkglist
</pre><p>Any additional package names can be appended to the end of
this file. After my list was complete, I removed the packages not
on the list by using the syncRpms.py script (see Resources). The
arguments are the package directory and the list of packages is
generated from getGroupPkgs.py. This script removes the packages
not listed in the package list and prints out the package names. We
redirect that to a file so we have a log:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /RH80
syncRpms.py ONE_CD/RedHat/RPMS/ pkglist &gt; pkgs_rem
</pre>


We can monitor the installation size by using the du command. The
-h option displays the result in human readable format, and the -s
option gives a summary of the whole directory tree:
<pre     class="programlisting">
du -hs /RH80/ONE_CD
</pre>


The hdlist files actually decrease in size after they are
regenerated (see below), because we removed many of the packages.
This in turn reduces the size of the CD image.
</p><p>The tricky part about removing packages is they may break
dependencies. Even though getGroupPkgs.py resolved the dependencies
base on the comps.xml file, they are not guaranteed to be accurate.
Adding additional packages may break dependencies as well. One way
to verify their accuracy is to create a temporary RPM database, and
then do a test install on that database with the packages you have
selected:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /RH80/ONE_CD/RedHat/RPMS
mkdir /tmp/testdb
rpm --initdb --dbpath /tmp/testdb
rpm --test --dbpath /tmp/testdb -Uvh *.rpm
</pre><p>Look for any error messages regarding failed dependencies. If
any appear, resolve the dependencies by either adding or removing
files that caused the discrepancy, and repeat the above test.
</p><p>Once the package dependencies have been resolved, you can
download the package updates pertinent for your installation. Put
these files under a separate directory:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p /RH80/updates/RPMS/
</pre><p>Remove the old files from the build directory and then link
the updated files to the build directory. Do this for each updated
package (where <span   class="emphasis"><em>old_rpmfile</em></span> is the previous
version of the package):
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /RH80/ONE_CD/RedHat/RPMS/
rm
# ... remove each old rpm
cd /RH80/updates/RPMS/
cp -l
# ... do this for each rpm
</pre>


You should keep a record of the updated packages, in case you need
to back them out. It's also a good idea to check the dependencies
and size one more time, in case they changed after the packages
were updated.
</p><p>Next, we check the internal checksum of each package with the
-K option to rpm. First we need to import the key:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /RH80/ONE_CD/RedHat/RPMS
rpm --import /usr/share/rhn/RPM-GPG-KEY
rpm -K *.rpm | grep "NOT *OK"
</pre><p>This isn't strictly necessary, but because we downloaded
package updates, this verifies they are valid.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x2243630"></a>Preparing the Installation Files</h2></div></div><p>Once all of the packages have been updated, we need to
regenerate the hdlist files. They contain only the headers of the
packages, which allows Anaconda to retrieve the header information
more quickly. Because we updated packages, we need to regenerate
these files with the genhdlist tool, which is part of the
anaconda-runtime package:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/lib/anaconda-runtime/genhdlist /RH80/ONE_CD/
</pre><p>Next we need to handle the comps.xml file. This file defines
package groups and package dependencies (although they are not
guaranteed). The file structure was changed in Red Hat 8.0 to be
XML-based; in previous releases it was only a simple text file with
some obscure tags. We need to ensure that packages defined within
groups are included in our installation. We need to be concerned
only with groups we are installing. If packages are missing (or if
packages were added), we need to edit the comps.xml file (see
Resources). Because we chose all of the packages in the Core and
Base groups, however, we don't need to edit this file. We simply
need to specify those groups under the %packages directive in the
Kickstart file. See Listing 1 for an excerpt from the Kickstart
file.
</p><p><a href="6473l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Excerpt from the
Kickstart File</a></p><p>Technically, we can leave out the @Core and @Base groups, as
they are installed by default. They are included here for
illustrative purposes.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x22438f0"></a>Creating a Custom Message Screen</h2></div></div><p>We also want to create a custom message screen to give the
user special instructions. The message screens are kept in the
boot.img file (for CD-ROM installs) under the images directory.
This is a DOS filesystem, so we can mount it to get to the
contents:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /RH80/ONE_CD/images
mount -o loop -t msdos boot.img /mnt/boot
</pre><p>Looking in /mnt/boot, you see six message files: boot.msg,
options.msg, general.msg, param.msg, rescue.msg and snake.msg. We
create our own message file and call it custom.msg, an arbitrary
name. Because snake.msg isn't really used, we replace that entry
within syslinux.cfg with custom.msg. Edit syslinux.cfg in /mnt/boot
and replace F7 snake.msg with F7 custom.msg.
</p><p>A few other modifications were made to the syslinux.cfg file;
refer to Listing 2. The default entry was changed from linux to ks.
If the timeout occurs or if the user presses Enter at the boot
prompt, then the ks label is used. Additionally, the timeout value
was decreased from 600 to 60, so the installation can start sooner
if there is no input from the user. The display entry was changed
as well. Instead of boot.msg being the initial message screen, we
wanted our custom message to be displayed. For the append line
under the ks label, we added two things. The first is the keyword
text, to enable text-based installs. Then we changed the keyword ks
to ks=cdrom:/ks.cfg. This hard codes the Kickstart location so the
user doesn't have to specify it at the boot prompt.</p><p><a href="6473l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Modified syslinux.cfd
File</a></p><p>Next we create our custom.msg file. Listing 3 shows our
custom.msg. The contents of the file can be marked up, such as
adding color around words. For example, ^O09Custom^O02 changes the
color of Custom to blue, and ^O02 changes it back. See the syslinux
reference in the Resources section for more information.</p><p><a href="6473l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Custom
Message</a></p><p>Once we have composed the custom message, we need to umount
the boot image:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
umount /mnt/boot
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x223a5f8"></a>Building the CD</h2></div></div><p>Before actually creating the CD, you may want to test it by
doing a network install. See the Red Hat Kickstart documentation on
how to do this.</p><p>We want this custom installation to be automated, so we put
the Kickstart file on the CD itself. You can create the Kickstart
file with any text editor, or you can use the GUI tool called
Kickstart Configurator.</p><p>In the %pre section, add a shell script to probe the hard
drives and dynamically create the partition information based on
the number of drives. We take advantage of the fact that Kickstart
executes the %pre section and then re-reads the Kickstart file.
When it reads it for the second time, it includes the /tmp/partinfo
file where the %include directive is located (see Listing 1). The
/tmp/partinfo file is the output from the script. We use the
list-harddrives command, which lists the available hard drives and
their sizes. Having the partition created dynamically frees us from
having to create multiple Kickstart files that hard code the
partition information.</p><p>Once the Kickstart file is created, name it ks.cfg and place
it in the root directory of our installation tree (/RH80/ONE_CD/).
It is possible to create more than one Kickstart file and place all
of them on the CD. Different Kickstart files might address
different hardware configurations.</p><p>We can now create the ISO image. From our previous steps, the
distribution should be small enough to fit on one CD and contain
all of the updated packages. The mkisofs program creates the image,
and then we can copy the image to the CD. The command to create the
ISO image is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /RH80/ONE_CD
mkisofs -r -T -J \
-V "My Custom Installation CD" \
-b images/boot.img \
-c images/boot.cat \
-o /RH80/mydist.iso \
/RH80/ONE_CD
</pre><p>Refer to Table 1 for a description of the options.
</p><p><a href="6473t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Options Used for
mkisofs</a></p><p>The last parameter to mkisofs is the source directory of the
contents that need to be included in the image file (e.g., our
custom installation directory). Several other parameters are
available that you may want to use. For example, the -A, -P and -p
options add additional labeling information to the image. The -m
and -x options also allow you to exclude certain directories and
file patterns from the image. See the mkisofs man page for
additional information.</p><p>Next, add a checksum to the ISO image. This is not strictly
necessary, but it provides a way for end users to check the
integrity of the CD. The tool to add a checksum to the ISO image is
called implantisomd5. To add a checksum to the ISO image, use the
following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
implantisomd5 /RH80/mydist.iso
</pre><p>A companion tool, checkisomd5, can be used to verify the
checksum for you:
<pre     class="programlisting">
checkisomd5 /RH80/mydist.iso
</pre>


The CD also can be verified during the installation. After booting
from the CD, the user can issue this command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
linux mediacheck
</pre>


Now we can burn the image to the CD. I assume the CD writer is
already set up on your system. We use cdrecord below, but you can
use other programs as well. The command is invoked as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cdrecord -v speed=4 dev=0,0,0 /RH80/mydist.iso
</pre>


The speed and dev options depend on your system. The device for the
dev argument can be determined by using the -scanbus option to
cdrecord:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cdrecord -scanbus
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x223ac80"></a>Using the CD</h2></div></div><p>Once the image is burned onto the CD, insert the CD into the
target machine and boot the machine. You should get the custom
message that you created earlier. At this point, you can either
press Enter at the boot prompt or let it timeout. When it times out
it uses the default label, which we specified as ks
(Kickstart).</p><p>If we did everything right, the installation should proceed
without user interaction. In my experience, the installation takes
approximately ten minutes. This may differ depending on your exact
configuration.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x214a580.0x223ade0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>With a combination of Kickstart and a customized Anaconda, a
powerful and flexible installation can be created. This
installation greatly improved cycle time and reduced errors for my
project. I was able to install multiple machines, multiple times
almost effortlessly. In this article, I touched on only a few ways
to take advantage of Kickstart and Anaconda, but there are many
other possibilities. I encourage those interested to read the
documentation in the Resources section and to join the Kickstart
and Anaconda mailing lists for further information.</p><p><a href="6473s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
