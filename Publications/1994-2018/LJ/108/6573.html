    How can you create a USB device that works with the generic
    USB serial driver? Read and learn.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdfc580.0xef43a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the first part of this article
[<i  >LJ</i>, February 2003], I introduced the USB
serial layer and the basics of how to register a driver with the
layer. This article explains some of the details about how data
flows through the layer and how USB serial devices show up in
sysfs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdfc580.0xef4500"></a>Generic USB Serial Devices</h2></div></div><p>In Part I of this article, I briefly mentioned the generic
USB driver in the context of getting a USB device to communicate
through it easily, with no custom kernel programming.
Unfortunately, I didn't explain exactly how to do this, and many
people wrote in with questions.</p><p>To create a USB device that works with the generic USB serial
driver, all that is needed is two bulk USB endpoints on the device,
one IN and one OUT. The generic USB serial driver will bind those
two endpoints together into a single tty device that can be read
from and written to from user space. For example, a device with the
endpoints as described by /proc/bus/usb/devices (Figure 1) shows up
as a single port device and produces the following kernel message
when plugged in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Generic converter detected
Generic converter now attached to ttyUSB0
    (or usb/tts/0 for devfs)
</pre><p>Then any user can send data to the device through the
/dev/ttyUSB0 node.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6573f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Sample /proc/bus/usb/devices Entry
</p></div></div>

</p><p>If a device has more than one bulk IN and bulk OUT pair,
multiple ports are assigned to the device. For example, a device
with the endpoints as described by /proc/bus/usb/devices (Figure 2)
shows up as a two-port device and produces the following kernel
messages when plugged in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Generic converter detected
Generic converter now attached to ttyUSB0
    (or usb/tts/0 for devfs)
Generic converter now attached to ttyUSB1
    (or usb/tts/1 for devfs)
</pre><p>For this device, both /dev/ttyUSB0 and /dev/ttyUSB1 can be
used to communicate.
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6573f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Entry for a Two-Port Device in /proc/bus/usb/devices
</p></div></div>

</p><p>The order of the endpoints is not important, so all of the IN
endpoints could be first, followed by the OUT endpoints (unlike the
previous examples that alternate). The USB serial core will take
all of the IN and OUT endpoints and pair them up in the order they
are seen. It also will assign an interrupt endpoint to a bulk pair,
if one is present, but the interrupt endpoint will not be used by
the generic driver; it can be used only by a USB serial driver
within the kernel.</p><p>To get the generic USB serial driver to bind to the device,
the USB vendor and product IDs need to be specified as a module
parameter when the usbserial module is loaded. For example, to bind
to the previously described device with a vendor ID of ffff and
product ID of fff8, use the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe usbserial vendor=0xffff product=0xfff8
</pre><p>If the user cannot be expected to load the usbserial module
with the specific device ID, or if more than one device ID should
be used by the generic USB serial driver, a very tiny driver can be
written. An example of this is shown in Listing 1. In this driver,
no callback functions are specified, only the product and vendor
IDs of the devices that should be controlled. This is shown in the
declaration of the struct usb_serial_device_type:
<pre     class="programlisting">
static struct usb_serial_device_type tiny_device = {
    .owner =            THIS_MODULE,
    .name =             "Tiny USB serial",
    .short_name =       "tiny",
    .id_table =         id_table,
    .num_interrupt_in = NUM_DONT_CARE,
    .num_bulk_in =      NUM_DONT_CARE,
    .num_bulk_out =     NUM_DONT_CARE,
    .num_ports =        1,
};
</pre>


Specific vendor and product IDs should be listed in the id_table
pointer:
<pre     class="programlisting">
static struct usb_device_id id_table [] = {
    { USB_DEVICE(MY_PRODUCT_ID, MY_DEVICE_ID1) },
    { USB_DEVICE(MY_PRODUCT_ID, MY_DEVICE_ID2) },
    { USB_DEVICE(MY_PRODUCT_ID, MY_DEVICE_ID3) },
    { }     /* Terminating entry */
};
</pre>


</p><p><a href="6573l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. The Tiny Tiny USB Serial
Driver</a></p><p>In all, this driver contains only two functions, which are
two and three lines long, and three variable definitions. With it,
all of the generic USB serial driver functionality will occur for
the specified devices. The driver automatically will be loaded for
the device when it is plugged in to the system, which is also a
nice feature. This has to be one of the smallest working Linux
kernel drivers possible. Compile it with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo "obj-m := tiny_tiny_usbserial.o" &gt; Makefile
make -C &lt;path/to/kernel/src&gt; SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
</pre><p>The Windows operating system also supports this kind of
device interface through the Windows USB OPOS serial driver, which
will create virtual &ldquo;COM&rdquo; ports for the device. This allows
hardware vendors to create USB devices that do not require any
custom driver development for both Linux and Windows machines,
which can be highly desirable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdfc580.0xef4f50"></a>Life Cycle of a USB Serial Device</h2></div></div><p>When a USB-to-serial device is plugged in, a long series of
steps are taken to allow a specific USB-to-serial driver to control
an individual tty device. The steps are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The USB hub driver detects a new device. It assigns
a USB number to the device and reads the basic USB description from
the device, which it then populates into a struct usb_device with a
number of struct usb_interfaces that represent the whole USB
device.</p></li><li><p>The USB core takes the device and registers the USB
interfaces with the kernel driver core.</p></li><li><p>The kernel driver core looks through the currently
registered list of USB drivers to determine if any of them will
accept this device.</p></li><li><p>Because this is a USB-to-serial device, the USB
serial core accepts control of the device from the kernel driver
core.</p></li><li><p>The USB serial core builds up a single struct,
usb_serial, and calls the specific USB serial driver's probe()
function with this structure.</p></li><li><p>The USB serial driver's probe() function
initializes the device if it should and then returns control back
to the USB serial core.</p></li><li><p>The USB serial core creates the struct
usb_serial_port structures depending on the number of serial ports
on this specific device and then calls the USB serial driver's
attach() function, if present.</p></li><li><p>After the attach() function returns, the individual
struct usb_serial_port structures are registered with the kernel
driver core.</p></li><li><p>The kernel driver core calls back into the USB
serial core for every individual port.</p></li><li><p>The USB serial core calls the individual
port_probe() function in the USB serial driver for the port, if
present, and then registers the port with the tty layer, completing
the initialization process.</p></li></ul></div><p>After this process, the tty device node is bound to the
individual USB serial port. When the device node is opened by a
user, the following steps happen in the kernel:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The kernel looks up the device node and determines
that the tty layer has registered this node, so it calls the tty
layer's open function.</p></li><li><p>The tty layer looks up the device and determines
that the USB serial core has registered this node with it, so it
calls serial_open() in the drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c
file.</p></li><li><p>The serial_open() function determines what specific
USB serial driver is registered for this node.</p></li><li><p>The module count for the specified USB serial
driver is incremented in order to prevent it from being unloaded
while a user is talking to the device.</p></li><li><p>If the specified USB serial driver has an open()
function, it is called with struct usb_serial_port for the specific
port being passed to it.</p></li><li><p>The USB serial driver then can do any
hardware-specific open functionality that is needed and send off
any USB urbs that are necessary to start accepting data from the
device.</p></li></ul></div><p>When a user calls write() on the device node to send data to
the specified serial port, the following steps happen in the
kernel:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The kernel calls the tty_write() function within
the tty core. It has previously set up this pointer during the open
call, so it will not look it up again.</p></li><li><p>tty_write() calls the line discipline's write()
function for this specific tty device.</p></li><li><p>The line discipline calls the USB serial core
serial_write() function.</p></li><li><p>The serial_write() function determines the specific
USB serial driver used by this file and calls the write() function
of it.</p></li><li><p>The USB serial driver can then copy the data into a
buffer and send it out the USB connection to the device, handling
any special formatting issues the device might require.</p></li><li><p>After the data has been sent completely, the driver
can wake up the tty device in order to send any buffered data to
it. This should be done with the simple call:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
schedule_work(&amp;port-&gt;work);
</pre><p>When data is received by the USB serial driver for a specific
port, it should place the data into the specific tty structure
assigned to that port's flip buffer:
<pre     class="programlisting">
for (i = 0; i &lt; data_size; ++i) {
    if (tty-&gt;flip.count &gt;= TTY_FLIPBUF_SIZE)
        tty_flip_buffer_push(tty);
    tty_insert_flip_char(tty, data[i], 0);
}
tty_flip_buffer_push(tty);
</pre>


When a user calls read() on the device node, any data in the tty
flip buffer for this port is returned.
</p><p>When the device node is closed by the user, the following
steps occur within the kernel:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The tty_release() function is called in the tty
core by the kernel.</p></li><li><p>tty_release() determines if this is the last
reference held on this device node (remember, a device node can be
opened by multiple programs at the same time). If it is, the USB
serial core serial_close() function is called.</p></li><li><p>The serial_close() function calls the USB serial
driver's close() function, allowing it to shut down any pending USB
transfers and get into a quiet state.</p></li><li><p>The USB serial core then decrements the module
count for the USB serial driver, possibly allowing it to be
unloaded.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdfc580.0xeece38"></a>sysfs Representation of USB Serial
Devices</h2></div></div><p>In the previous description of how the USB serial device
becomes bound to a specific USB serial driver, the kernel driver
core is called a number of times. This happens because the USB
serial core is represented as a bus within the kernel driver model,
allowing multiple ports to be present on a single USB
device.</p><p>For example, the following device is an eight-port
USB-to-serial device on the first USB bus in the system. Its
location in sysfs is /sys/devices/pci0/00:09.0/usb1/1-1/1-1.1.
Within that directory are the following directories and files:
1-1.1:0/, bcdDevice, bConfigurationValue, bDeviceClass,
bDeviceProtocol, bDeviceSubClass, bmAttributes, bMaxPower,
bNumConfigurations, bNumInterfaces, idProduct, idVendor,
manufacturer, name, power, product, serial, speed, ttyUSB0/,
ttyUSB1/, ttyUSB2/, ttyUSB3/, ttyUSB4/, ttyUSB5/, ttyUSB6/ and
ttyUSB7/.</p><p>The files in this directory provide the USB-specific
information for this device, as do the files in the 1-1.1:0/
directory, which is the first interface on this device. The ttyUSB*
directories are created by the USB serial core and contain the
following files: dev, name and power.</p><p>The dev file contains the major and minor number for this
specific device, which then can be used to determine the proper
device node for talking to it. In the /sys/bus/usb directory, this
USB device is seen as being bound to the io_edgeport USB driver
(Figure 3).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6573f3.large.jpg"><img src="6573f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The /sys/bus/usb Tree
</p></div></div><p>There is also a usb-serial bus, which shows the individual
USB serial ports that are registered with the kernel (Figure 4). As
these individual ports are tty devices, they also show up in the
tty class directory (Figure 5).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6573f4.large.jpg"><img src="6573f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6573f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The /sys/class/tty Tree
</p></div></div><p>Through all of these different links back to the single USB
device, the type of USB device, how many tty ports it has and what
type of USB serial driver controls it, easily can be determined.
This is also much more information than what was shown in the
/proc/tty/driver/usb-serial file, as described in Part I of this
article.</p><p>The sysfs interface is described here only briefly, but it
contains a wealth of information about all physical and virtual
devices that are contained in a system at a given point in time.
