    Give your web site newspaper-grade content management with

Back when a webmaster was a jack-of-all-trades, doing everything
from graphic design to database programming to DNS table
manipulation? As the Web matured, however, one-person web sites
became increasingly rare. True, it's still relatively easy for a
someone to create and maintain a simple web site, but even the
smallest organizations typically split responsibility between
programmers, designers and the people who provide content.
Moreover, many organizations want different people to be
responsible for different types of content, with each having
ultimate authority over a particular section.
</p><p>Of course, this is old hat to the publishing world. Back when
I edited my college newspaper, we used a composition and
typesetting system called Atex. Atex was beloved for many reasons
but mostly because it worked the way that newspapers do. Reporters
using an Atex system would send articles to their editors by
pressing the Send button on a massive, specialized keyboard.
Editors could look at the list of articles awaiting their
attention, edit articles, send an article back to the reporter who
wrote it or send articles onto the Typesetting department. By
design, everyone was forbidden from viewing, modifying or
retrieving articles they had sent to the next person in the process
chain. The image of a reporter shouting &ldquo;stop the presses!&rdquo; might
be romantic and inspiring, but it is also unrealistic in today's
world, where newspapers are businesses with tight deadlines.</p><p>As web sites grow to resemble newspapers, we should not be
surprised to see them adopting software&mdash;known as content
management systems, or CMS&mdash;that works much like Atex used to do.
But organizing documents, people and work flow is a difficult task,
particularly if you try to put everyone's needs into a single
software package. So even though content management is crucial to
an increasing number of web sites, CMS salespeople have gained a
reputation for selling bloated, expensive software that is large on
promises and small on delivery.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf00580.0xff86b8"></a>What Does a CMS Do?</h2></div></div><p>One of the problems with content management is that every web
site has different needs. For this reason, proprietary CMS software
usually is sold in two parts. The customer first pays for the basic
software and then pays at least as much in consulting and support
services. Thus, CMS software is not only expensive but requires a
fair amount of implementation and testing time. In other words, a
CMS usually is closer to a toolkit than a finished application.
Most of these toolkits include the following functionality:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Users: if everyone on a web site is going to be
given different permissions, obviously each user will need a
different login. A CMS thus comes with user-management software,
allowing you to create, delete, edit and ban users on the system.
Most systems also make it possible for users to retrieve forgotten
passwords.</p></li><li><p>Permissions: just as Linux allows you to set read,
write and execute permissions on different files, CMS software
typically allows the site administrator to define different
permissions for each user on the system. To return to our newspaper
analogy, reporters are allowed to enter content, editors can modify
content (or return it to a reporter) and publishers can make
content publicly available (or return it to an editor).</p></li><li><p>Groups: although you theoretically can assign
permissions to individual users, this quickly becomes tedious. So,
most CMS software allows you to group users together for the sake
of assigning permissions. For example, you can indicate that Tom,
Dick and Harry can write and edit but not publish, or you can
assign these permissions to the Canonical Names group, with the
same effect.</p></li><li><p>Templates: many templating systems exist, including
JSP, HTML::Mason and PHP. The best ones separate design, content
and programming logic from each other, so designers, writers and
programmers can work on a site simultaneously without stepping on
one another's toes.</p></li><li><p>Publishing: the Web's biggest double-edged sword is
its instantaneousness. The moment you modify foo.html on your
server, everyone can see what changes you made. What if you made a
mistake? What if you want to test the file beforehand? The CMS
solution is to mark each piece of content as published when it
should be viewed by the outside world. Until an article has been
published, it is invisible.</p></li><li><p>Staging or previewing: just as newspaper and
magazine publishers want to see what the finished product will look
like before they begin to print actual copies, web publishers want
to preview their site before it is live on the Web. Thus, many
sites run staging servers, identical in most ways to their
production servers except they are hidden from the outside world.
Testing is done on these preview servers; when the editor or
publisher is satisfied, content is pushed to the production
servers. A CMS almost certainly will allow you to set up your
system in this way.</p></li><li><p>Work flow: staging is the final step in what might
be a long journey from an author's workstation to a production web
server. How content makes its way through the system is known as
work flow, and much of what a CMS does is allow you to define and
manage that work flow. Should reporters be allowed to yank stories
back from their editors? How many levels of editors do you want?
Where do designers fit in? Who gives the final send-off to content?
All of these questions are handled by the work-flow portion of a
CMS.</p></li><li><p>Publishing dates: the good news about the Web is
that things are published instantaneously. But what if your
corporation is announcing a stock split and cannot reveal that
information until 9:00 <b  >AM</b> on Monday? You could
sit next to the computer, waiting until the clock strikes 9:00 to
press the Enter key and revealing the document for everyone to see.
Or you can use a CMS, which typically allows you to specify when an
article will appear, as well as when it should expire.</p></li><li><p>Web-based editing: although a web browser is one of
the worst possible programs to use for serious text editing, most
CMS systems allow you to write some or all of your documents using
your browser. To be fair, just about every CMS also lets you upload
files from your local computer. Web-based editing comes in handy
when you're on the run or want to touch up one or two things. Of
course, any CMS that offers such editing facilities also checks
that someone trying to edit a page is authorized to do so.</p></li><li><p>Search: most CMS packages offer some sort of search
facility, so you can find documents within the system.</p></li></ul></div><p>Although this list is by no means exhaustive, it should give
you a sense of the types of problems that a CMS tries to solve. But
as you can imagine, every CMS offers a slightly different set of
features and different ways of attacking these problems.</p><p>Because a CMS spends much of its time storing, retrieving and
tracking content, it should come as no surprise that a database is
almost essential to a CMS. Commercial CMS packages typically expect
you to use a proprietary database system, such as Oracle or
Microsoft's SQL Server. As you might expect, open-source CMS
software generally is designed to work best with open-source
databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Zope's Content Management
Framework (CMF), which is a toolkit for creating a custom CMS, also
uses a database, but in this case, it's the built-in Zope Object
Database (ZODB) rather than an external relational database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf00580.0xff9000"></a>Content Management vs. Application
Development</h2></div></div><p>If you have ever developed serious web applications, you
immediately will see a large degree of overlap between the features
a CMS offers and the features you expect from a web application
server. Most CMS software sits on top of a web application server,
using its underlying infrastructure to handle HTTP connectivity,
users, groups, permissions and even the database API. In some ways,
CMS was the first popular class of application to be deployed on
the Web, much as spreadsheets were the first applications used on
personal computers.</p><p>Overall, it's a good thing CMS software is written on top of
an application server, especially in the open-source world. This
means you can add new modules to the core CMS, handle new types of
documents, change the templates, extend the database and add new
types of permissions and work-flow rules. But it's important to
remember the difference between an application server and a CMS.
The former provides the infrastructure for creating applications,
and the latter is an application you can customize.</p><p>So if you're looking to create a web-based newspaper,
magazine or corporate news site, a CMS is undoubtedly the right
type of software for you. But if you want to create a web-based
application that tracks donations to your favorite charity, a CMS
probably won't provide the flexibility you need. The difference
between web applications and web publications has always been a
murky one, but as web applications become increasingly
sophisticated, CMS software will be recognized as one type of
product you can run on a web platform.</p><p>Because content management systems normally run on top of an
application server, your choice of CMS might depend on the type of
server on which it runs. Many companies have moved to J2EE (Java 2
Enterprise Edition) as their underlying platform. Indeed, the
well-known Vignette CMS originally was designed to work with Tcl
but migrated to J2EE when the buzz surrounding J2EE became too
great to ignore. Because J2EE is a standard, rather than a product,
customers can choose application servers and CMS software
separately. You can use the open-source Tomcat/JBoss duo or the
proprietary offerings from companies like BEA or IBM.</p><p>If you dislike Java, or if your development team is more
familiar with another set of technologies, you might consider a
non-J2EE CMS. Such products do exist, and we will look at several
of them in the coming months, such as Zope's CMF, the CMF-based
Plone, Bricolage (Perl/PostgreSQL), PHPNuke/PostNuke/Xoops (PHP)
and Midgard (PHP).</p><p>Regardless of what technology you decide to use, a CMS is
increasingly necessary and useful for producing web sites. Even if
you're the only person working on your web site, moving to a CMS is
probably a wise move, if only to help standardize the look, feel
and delivery of content on your site. And, if you ever decide to
add new types of content, the CMS will probably be able to handle
it, though you might need to tinker with it somewhat.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf00580.0xff92c0"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>CMS software is probably the first type of application
designed for the Web. Most content management solutions are
expensive and proprietary, but an increasing number of open-source
options are available for those who want greater freedom and lower
cost. Given that content management systems normally need a great
deal of customizing and tuning, this is another niche for which
open-source tools are an excellent fit.</p><p><a href="6563s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
