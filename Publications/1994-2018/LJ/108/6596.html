    Looking at applications that meet the needs of business and
    standards that are bridging the gap between competing Linux
    desktops.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2487580.0x257f348"></a></h2></div></div><p>The last thing we're going to try to do
this month is answer the question, &ldquo;Is Linux ready for the
Desktop?&rdquo;, because only you can answer that. Nobody's going to
blow a whistle and make it practical for everyone at once to
install desktop Linux.
</p><p>I've been using Linux on the desktop since around the time
Netscape Navigator came out. Unfortunately, many of the
applications people use to get their jobs done aren't available on
Linux yet. So if you have a lot of data buried in some proprietary
format, you might have to keep some proprietary desktops around. In
this issue though we're going to provide as much information as
possible to help put your company or organization on the path of
freedom and self-determination.</p><p>Leading by example is Gary Maxwell, who's no Linux or UNIX
guru&mdash;just a small-business owner looking for stability in his
working environment. He's now running his whole commercial writing
firm on free software. Find out how he's doing on page 48.</p><p>If you don't like the fact that applications written with
different toolkits often don't work well together, now there's
something you can do about it. Check out our cover and read Marco
Fioretti's &ldquo;The Grand Unified Desktop&rdquo; article on page 38. Marco
received a lot of comments on our web site when he praised Red
Hat's Bluecurve desktop for mixing the best of GNOME and KDE, and
now he's taking an in-depth look at standards for things like
drag-and-drop and configuration files. Don't take sides in the
desktop war&mdash;follow standards so you can use the applications you
like.</p><p>Page 44's article comes from the &ldquo;stuff the editor wanted to
learn&rdquo; pile. Chris Schoeneman has invented what you might call a
software KVM switch. It's Synergy, a program that lets you move the
pointer to the edge of one system's display and start working on
another system. Set your laptop down next to your desktop system,
and automatically get more work space without switching
keyboards.</p><p>Setting up Linux for desktop use still has some tricky parts,
and scanning certainly qualifies. On page 54, Michael J. Hammel
goes through the intricate dance of setting up a scanner. If you
can do this, buy yourself a beverage and consider yourself ready
for most Linux tasks.</p><p>Whether you're planning to develop software for desktop
Linux, run The GIMP or design a web content management system,
there's plenty of other good stuff in this issue too.</p><p>Finally, you might not think of &ldquo;Hacking Red Hat Kickstart&rdquo;
(page 83) as a desktop Linux article. After all, the whole point
Brett Schwarz makes is you can install and configure a new system
without touching the mouse and keyboard even once. But the promise
of user control over time-consuming tasks is one important reason
people think a Linux desktop is worth the effort in the first
place.</p></div></div>
