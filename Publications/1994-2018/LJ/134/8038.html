Computer scientists have been studying artificial neural networks (ANNs) since the
1950s. Although ANNs were inspired by real biological
networks like those in your brain, typical ANNs
do not model a number of aspects of biology that
may turn out to be important. Real neurons, for example,
communicate by sending out little spikes of voltage
called action potentials (APs). ANNs, however, do not model
the timing of these individual APs. Instead, ANNs
typically assume that APs are repetitive, and they
model only the rate of that repetition. For a while,
most researchers believed that modeling the spike rate
was enough to capture the interesting behavior of the
network. But what if some of the computational power
of a biological neural network was derived from the
precise timing of the individual APs? Regular ANNs
could never model such a possibility.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25cb580.0x26c33f8"></a>
NCS: the NeoCortical Simulator</h2></div></div><p>
In 1999, the thought that ANNs were overlooking the reality of individual APs convinced Phil Goodman at the University
of Nevada, Reno, to change his focus from ANNs to more realistic spiking
neural network models. He started by looking for a program that would
allow him to conduct experiments on large networks of spiking neurons.
At the time, a couple of excellent open-source research software
packages existed that were capable of simulating a few spiking neurons
realistically; GENESIS and NEURON were two of the most popular. But these programs
were not designed to work with the networks of thousands of spiking
neurons that he was envisioning. Goodman believed that with low-cost
Linux clustering technology, it should be possible to construct a parallel
program that was realistic enough to model the spiking and cellular
membrane channel behavior of neurons, while also being efficient enough
to allow the construction of large networks of these neurons for
study. Goodman launched the NeoCortical Simulator (NCS) Project to create
such a program. Starting with a prototype program that Goodman wrote
in the proprietary MATLAB environment, a student working with computer
science professor Sushil Louis wrote the first parallel version of NCS
in C using the MPI parallel library package.
</p><p>
When I joined the research group in 2002, NCS already was undergoing
a major rewrite by another student, James Frye, who was working with
CS professor Frederick C. Harris, Jr. This time, the goal was to take
the system from prototype to streamlined and reliable production
software system. I helped with this effort, implementing a number of
optimizations that greatly improved performance.
</p><p>
I also set up the first version control for the NCS source code, using
the then-new open-source Subversion system. At the time, Subversion
still was an alpha project. Nevertheless, I was sold on several
features of the system, including the automatic bundling of an entire
set of files into a single release. After working with Subversion a
bit, the old workhorse CVS seemed cumbersome in comparison. Subversion
was evolving quickly then. More than once after a system software
upgrade, though, I had to spend hours trying to rebuild a Subversion executable
with a certain combination of component library versions that would
restore access to our version history. The Subversion user mailing
list always was helpful during these recovery efforts. Eager to take
advantage of the new features, I willingly paid the price for choosing
alpha software. Fortunately, that trade-off is no longer necessary.
Subversion now is stable and flexible, and I would not hesitate to choose
it for any new project.
</p><p>
As the NCS software matured, our cluster expanded, thanks to several grants
from the US Office of Naval Research. The initial Beowulf cluster
of 30 dual-processor Pentium III machines grew with the addition of 34
dual-processor Pentium 4s. It grew again recently with the addition of 40
dual-processor Opterons. Linux has been the OS for the cluster from the start,
running the Rocks cluster Linux release. The compute nodes are equipped with a
full 4GB of system memory to hold the large number of synapse structures
in the brain models. Memory capacity was a major motivation for moving
to the 64-bit Opterons. Administrative network traffic moves on a 100MB
and, later, 1GB Ethernet connection, while a specialized low-latency
Myrinet network efficiently passes the millions of AP spike messages
that occur in a typical neural network simulation.

Designing Brain Models</h2></div></div><p>
With NCS now capable of simulating networks of thousands of spiking
neurons and many millions of synapses, students began to use
it for actual research. NCS could be quite hard to use effectively in
practice, however, as I discovered when I began my own first large-scale
simulation experiments. Much of the difficulty in using NCS stemmed from
the fact that NCS takes a plain-text file as input. This input file
defines the characteristics of the neural network, including neuron and
dendrite compartments, synapses, ion channels and more. For a large
neural network model, this text file often grows to thousands or even
hundreds of thousands of lines.
</p><p>
Although this plain-text file approach allows a great deal of flexibility in model
definition, it quickly becomes apparent to anyone doing serious work
with NCS that it is not practical to create network models by directly
editing the input file in a text editor. If the model contains more
than a handful of neural structures, hand-editing is tedious and prone
to error. So every student eventually ends up implementing some sort
of special purpose macro processor to help construct the input file
by repeatedly emitting text chunks with variable substitutions based
on a loop or other control structure. Several of these preprocessors
were built in the proprietary MATLAB language, because MATLAB also is
useful for the post-simulation data analysis and is a popular tool in our
lab. Each of these macro processors was implemented hurriedly with one
specific network model in mind. No solution was general enough to be
used by the next student, therefore, causing a great deal of redundant effort.
</p><p>
I searched for a more general solution, both for my own work and to
prevent future students from facing these familiar hurdles as they started
to use NCS for large experiments. No templated preprocessing approach
seemed up to the task. After a bit of experimentation, I concluded that
the best way of specifying a brain model was directly as a program&mdash;not
as a templated text file that would be parsed by a program, but actually
as a program itself.
</p><p>
To understand the problem, consider that our brain models often
contain hundreds or thousands of structures called cortical columns,
each made up of a hundred or more neurons. These columns have complex,
often variable internal structures, and these columns themselves are
interconnected by synapses in complex ways. We might want to adjust
the patterns of some or all of these connections from run to run. For
example, we might want to connect a column to all neighbor columns that
lie within a certain distance range, with a certain probability that
is a function of the distance. Even this relatively simple connection
pattern can't be expressed conveniently in the NCS input file, which
permits only a plain list of objects and connections.
</p><p>
But, by storing the brain model itself as a small script that constructs
the connections, we could have a model in only a few lines of code instead of thousands of
lines of text. This code easily could be modified later for variations
of the experiment. All the powerful looping and control constructs,
math capabilities and even object orientation of the scripting language
could be available directly to the brain modeler. Behind the scenes,
the script automatically could convert the script representation of
the model into the NCS text input file for actual simulation. No brain
modeler ever would be bound by a restrictive parsed template structure
again. I gave the generalized script-based modeling environment that I
planned to develop the name Brainlab and set to work picking a suitable
scripting language for the project.

Brainlab</h2></div></div><p>
My first thought for a scripting language was MATLAB, given its prominence
in our lab. But repeated licensing server failures during critical
periods had soured me on MATLAB. I considered Octave, an excellent
open-source MATLAB work-alike that employed the same powerful vector processing
approach. I generally liked what I saw and even ported a
few MATLAB applications to work in Octave in a pinch. I was pleased
to find that the conversions were relatively painless, complicated only
by MATLAB's loose language specification. But I found Octave's syntax
awkward, which was no surprise because it largely was inherited from MATLAB.
My previous Tcl/Tk experiences had been positive, but there didn't seem to
be much of a scientific community using it. I had done a few projects
in Perl over the years, but I found it hard to read and easy to forget.
</p><p>
Then I started working with Python on a few small projects. Python's
clean syntax, powerful and well-designed object-oriented capabilities
and large user community with extensive libraries and scientific toolkits
made it a joy to use. Reading Python code was so easy and natural
that I could leave a project for a few months and pick it up again,
with barely any delay figuring out where I was when I left off. So
I created the first version of Brainlab using Python.
</p><p>
In Brainlab, a brain model starts as a Python object of the class BRAIN:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from brainlab import *
brain=BRAIN()
</pre>
</p><p>
This brain object initially contains a default library of cell types,
synapse types, ion channel types and other types of objects used to
build brain models. For example, the built-in ion channel types are
stored in a field in the BRAIN class named chantypes. This field
actually is a Python dictionary indexed by the name of the channel. It can
be viewed simply by printing out the corresponding Python dictionary:

<pre     class="programlisting">
print brain.chantypes
</pre>
</p><p>
A new channel type named ahp-3, based on the standard type named
ahp-2, could be created, modified and then viewed like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
nc=brain.Copy(brain.chantypes, 'ahp-2', 'ahp-3')
nc.parms['STRENGTH']="0.4 0.04"
print brain.chantypes['ahp-3']
</pre>
</p><p>
To build a real network, the brain must contain some instances of
these structures and not only type profiles. In NCS, every cell belongs to
a structure called a cortical column. We can create an instance of a
simple column and add it to our brain object like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
c1=brain.Standard1CellColumn()
brain.AddColumn(c1)
</pre>
</p><p>
This column object comes with a set of default ion channel instances and
other structures that we easily can adjust if necessary. Most often we
have a group of columns that we want to create and interconnect.
The following example creates a two-dimensional grid of columns in a
loop and then connects the columns randomly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cols={}
size=10
# create the columns and store them in cols{}
for i in range(size):
    for j in range(size):
        c=brain.Standard1CellColumn()
        brain.AddColumn(c)
        cols[i,j]=c
# now connect each column to another random column
# (using a default synapse)
for i in range(size):
    for j in range(size):
        ti=randint(0, size-1)
        tj=randint(0, size-1)
        fc=cols[i,j]; tc=cols[ti,tj]
        brain.AddConnect(fc, tc)
</pre>
</p><p>
Our brain won't do much unless it gets some stimulus. Therefore, we can define a
set of randomly spaced stimulus spikes in a Python list and apply it to
the first row of our column grid like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
t=0.0
stim=[]
for s in range(20):
    t+=random()*10.0
    stims.append(t)
for i in range(size):
    brain.AddStim(stim, cols[i,0])
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25cb580.0x26c3df0"></a>
Simulating the Models</h2></div></div><p>
So far, our brain model exists only as a Python object. In order to
run it in an NCS simulation, we have to convert it to the text input
file that NCS demands. Brainlab takes care of this conversion; simply
printing the brain object creates the corresponding NCS input text for
that model. The command <tt  >print brain</tt> prints more
than
3,000 lines of NCS input file text, even for the relatively
simple example shown here. More complicated models result in
even longer input files for NCS, but the program version of the model
remains quite compact.
</p><p>
By changing only a few parameters in the script, we can create a radically
different text NCS input file. The experimenter can save this text to a file
and then invoke the NCS simulator on that file from the command line.
Better yet, he or she can simulate the model directly within the Brainlab environment
without even bothering to look at the intermediate text, like this:
<tt  >brain.Run(nprocs=16)</tt>.
</p><p>
The Run() method invokes the brain model on the Beowulf cluster using
the indicated number of processor nodes. Most often, an experiment
is not simply a single simulation of an individual brain model. Real
experiments almost always consist of dozens or hundreds of simulation
runs of related brain models, with slightly different parameters or
stimuli for each run. This is where Brainlab really shines: creating a
model, simulating it, adjusting the model and then simulating it again
and again, all in one integrated environment. If we wanted to run an
experiment ten times, varying the synapse conduction strength with each
run and with a different job number each run so that we could examine
all the reports later, we might do something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for r in range(10):  # r is run number
    s=brain.syntypes['C.strong']
    s.parms['MAX_CONDUCT']=.01+.005*r
    brain.parms['JOB']='testbrain%d'%r
    brain.Run(nprocs=16)
</pre>

Toolkits for Data Analysis and Search</h2></div></div><p>
The numarray extension package for Python provides for efficient
manipulation and statistical analysis of the large NCS datasets
that result from a simulation. For graphs and charts of results, the
excellent matplotlib package produces publication quality output through
a simple yet powerful MATLAB-like interface (Figure 1). Brainlab
also provides a number of convenient interfaces for these packages,
making it easier to do the operations commonly needed for neuroscience
research. Brainlab also provides interactive examination of 3-D views of
the network models using the Python OpenGL binding (Figure 2).

Figure 2. For interactive experimentation with 3-D views, Brainlab offers
an OpenGL interface.
</p></div></div><p>
Quite often, some experimentation with a number of network parameters
is required in order to find a balanced brain model. For example,
if a synaptic strength is too high or too low, the model may not function
realistically. We have seen how Brainlab could help a modeler do a search
for a good model by repeatedly running the same model with a varying
parameter. But an even more powerful technique than that simple search
is to use another inspiration from biology, evolution, to do a genetic
search on the values of whole set of parameters. I have used Brainlab
to do this sort of multiparameter search with a genetic algorithm (GA)
module of my own design and also with the standard GA module of the
Scientific Python package, SciPy.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25cb580.0x26c4580"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Brainlab has made my complex experiments practical, perhaps even
possible. At this point I can't imagine doing them any other way.
In fact, if NCS were to be reimplemented from scratch, I would suggest a
significant design change: the elimination of the intermediate NCS input
text file format. This file format is just complex enough to require
a parser and the associated implementation complexity, documentation
burden and slowdown in the loading of brain models. At the same
time, it is not nearly expressive enough to be usable directly for any
but the simplest brain models. Instead, a scripting environment such as
Python/Brainlab could be integrated directly into NCS, and the scripts
could create structures in memory that are accessed directly from the
NCS simulation engine. The resulting system would be extremely powerful
and efficient, and the overall documentation burden would be reduced.
This general approach should be applicable to many different problems
in other areas of model building research.
</p><p>
This summer, NCS is going to be installed on a new 4,000-processor IBM BlueGene
cluster at our sister lab, the Laboratory of Neural Microcircuitry of
the Brain Mind Institute at the EPFL in Switzerland, in collaboration
with lab director Henry Markram. Early tests show that we can achieve a
nearly linear speedup in NCS performance with increasing cluster size,
due to efficient programming and the highly parallel nature of synaptic
connections in the brain. We hope that other researchers around the world
will find NCS and Brainlab useful in the effort to model and understand
the human brain.
