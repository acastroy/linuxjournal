<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #134, June 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

The <span   class="bold"><b>iswraid</b></span> driver seems to be on the fast track
into the 2.4 tree, apparently in spite of the fact
that it adds new functionality to a stable series
kernel. <span   class="bold"><b>Marcelo Tosatti</b></span> deferred to
<span   class="bold"><b>Jeff Garzik</b></span>'s
judgment on the issue, over strenuous objections
from other developers. Jeff reasoned that without
iswraid, 2.4 users would be unable to make use of
their hardware, while detractors (including <span   class="bold"><b>Arjan
van de Ven</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Bartlomiej
Zolnierkiewicz</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Christoph
Hellwig</b></span>) argued that the same could be said for all
new hardware that was not yet supported. As it stands,
the issue is Jeff's call to make, so we can expect
iswraid in an upcoming 2.4 release.
</p><p>
A number of new drivers have seen the light of day. <span   class="bold"><b>Vojtech Pavlik</b></span>
has written a driver for the <span   class="bold"><b>serial Elo touchscreen
device</b></span>, expected to
support all generations of serial Elos. Apparently this area of the kernel
is just waiting to bloom, as some folks have been supporting touchscreen
hardware for years as in-house company projects. A new <span   class="bold"><b>real-time-clock</b></span>
driver for the <span   class="bold"><b>ST M41T00 I2C RTC chip</b></span>
has been released by <span   class="bold"><b>Mark A. Greer</b></span>
and almost immediately is slated for inclusion in the 2.6 tree. Mark
also has released a driver for the I2C controller on Marvell's host bridge
for PPC and MIPS systems.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Willy Tarreau</b></span>, with blessings from Marcelo Tosatti, has started a new
hot fix branch of the 2.4 tree. The -hf branch will have the same
fixes that go into 2.4, but on an accelerated release schedule. New
drivers and updates to existing drivers will be excluded. The -hf branch
will be only for security fixes and clear bug fixes. Some might argue
that before putting out a -hf branch, Marcelo might consider a slightly
accelerated release schedule himself. But the situation seems to work
for the developers and is in tune with Marcelo's desire to affirm 2.4's
relentless drive toward stability and not to give in to any sense of
urgency in the process.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Christoph Lameter</b></span> has created a
<span   class="bold"><b>scrubd</b></span> page zeroing d&aelig;mon and related
kernel infrastructure. This is intended to help eke out the best possible
speed from the page fault handler, by zeroing pages of memory before
they are needed, rather than at the time they are requested. It's nice
to pay attention to this sort of improvement, because even though it
is not a new driver, changes no APIs and is not really visible to the
outside world, it contributes to making Linux the snappy, sleek operating
system that serves us all so well. These sorts of optimizations are the
bread and butter of Linux and should be recognized along with the hot
new drivers and fancy filesystems.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>out-of-memory process killer</b></span> (OOM Killer) continues to be one of
the tough nuts to crack in Linux development. <span   class="bold"><b>Mauricio Lin</b></span> recently
released a user-space version that he claimed worked as well as the
in-kernel version. There are many issues, however. A user-space tool runs the
risk of being the victim of an out-of-memory condition itself, like any
other program. But a kernel-side OOM killer is more difficult to tune for
a particular system. Mauricio's compromise moves the ranking algorithm
into user space, where it is more easily configurable, while leaving
the actual killer in the kernel, where it is somewhat protected
from the out-of-memory conditions it seeks to mitigate. Although it is a
controversial issue because of the many complexities of any OOM handling
tool, Mauricio's approach seems to be finding some support among top
developers like Marcelo Tosatti. Mauricio also has been working in related
areas, and he recently produced a patch to allow users to track the size of
a process' physical memory usage in the /proc directory. This also has
proven to be somewhat controversial, but <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew
Morton</b></span> favors it, and
others have proposed actual uses that would make it valuable in practice.
</p><p>
Jeff Garzik put out a reminder recently that several broken and
deprecated drivers soon would be removed from the 2.6 tree. The
iphase driver has been broken for years and won't even compile. The
xircom_tulip_cb driver is unmaintained and doesn't cover the full spectrum
of xircom 32-bit cards; the xircom_cb driver, on the other hand, works for
them all and is a fine replacement. The <span   class="bold"><b>eepro100</b></span> driver is unmaintained
and will be replaced by the e100 driver. However, users who are bumping
into issues where e100 is not yet a workable replacement can relax:
the issues will be resolved before eepro100 is removed.

If you're making maps, traveling, geocaching or
otherwise using a GPS with your Linux system, don't
let the crazy array of GPS data formats get you lost.
Robert Lipe's command-line tool GPSBabel does for GPS
data what ImageMagick does for graphics&mdash;converts
what you have to what you need. Read the fine manual
for options to convert data to and from
Garmin, Magellan and other manufacturers' formats,
along with formats that will work with Netstumbler,
Google Maps and other software.

<h2 class="title">Less Mythical Every Day</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #134, June 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

There's no shortage of Linux personal video recorders
(PVRs). Technically, TiVo is a Linux PVR. So are
lots of other set-top boxes and home entertainment
servers from vendors large and small. You can hack
one together yourself if you like. Russ Pavlicek,
my old Linux Show colleague, put one together last
summer. Look up &ldquo;Linux PVR&rdquo; on Google and Russ'
project often comes out on top.
</p><p>
Recently, however, I was a guest on The Linux Link
Tech show, where I learned from Patrick Davila
that MythTV (<a href="http://mythtv.org" target="_self">mythtv.org</a>), Isaac Richards' project (covered here
by Marcel Gagn&eacute; in his August 2003 Cooking with
Linux column, <a href="../113/6942.html" target="_self">/article/6942</a>)
&ldquo;has evolved into a major project with many
contributors&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The project is at version 0.17 at the time of this writing. Meanwhile, Freevo,
another familiar Linux PVR project is at 1.5.3, with a 2.0 release in
the works (<a href="http://freevo.sourceforge.net" target="_self">freevo.sourceforge.net</a>).
</p><p>
Patrick says, &ldquo;Install can be a bear&rdquo;, but the upside for DIY PVR
builders is a limitless variety of actual and potential services. Start
perusing those thousands of posts and threads about MythTV and it's
clear we're starting to see what motivated Isaac Richards in the first
place: a &ldquo;mythical convergence box&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;myth&rdquo; in this case is the convergence promise that the cable and
other large commercial players have never delivered in an uncompromised
form. Apple, Microsoft and other usual suspects, including the cable and
satellite TV set-top box makers, all want to move your &ldquo;digital
lifestyle&rdquo; onto their &ldquo;platform&rdquo;, rather than allow you to use and
build what you really want. The potential capabilities are limitless.
</p><p>
So far, in addition to pausing and time-shifting live
TV, MythTV features commercial skipping, multiple
codec support growing HDTV support, and a variety of
open-source applications. These include MythWeather
for local forecasts; MythDVD to copy and play DVDs;
MythGallery photo slideshows; the MythNews RSS
aggregator; MythMusic to rip, store and play back in
MP3, ogg, FLAC or WAV; a MythGame to keep your old
video game collection alive with xmame, fceultra and
zsnes; and MythPhone for voice and video using SIP.
</p><p>
In fact, MythTV is so promising that the EFF
(<a href="http://www.eff.org/broadcastflag" target="_self">www.eff.org/broadcastflag</a>) featured the project in a
call for independent builders to flesh out solutions that the &ldquo;broadcast
flag&rdquo; would outlaw if they aren't built before July 1, 2005:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We want to keep the right to time- and space-shift that the VCR has
given us (against Hollywood's protest). We want to keep the fair use
rights that let us excerpt clips from press conferences or make our
own &ldquo;Daily Show&rdquo; from the evening news. That's why we're encouraging
people to buy HDTV tuner cards now and build multifunction
receivers and recorders around them.
</p><p>
Here's where you can help. The folks at <a href="http://www.pchdtv.com" target="_self">www.pchdtv.com</a> make an
HD-capable (ATSC) tuner card with Linux drivers. The MythTV Project
has built a terrific personal video recorder (PVR) platform that
gives a GNU/Linux PC features like TiVo's pause live TV and &ldquo;season
pass&rdquo; recording. These are great for geeks, and we're looking for
volunteers to help make the combination more accessible to the
general public.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Time is running out, so get your HDTV hardware while you can.

Greg Hankins put multiport serial boards to the
test and found a Comtrol RocketPort board got the
best speed score, and a Cyclades one came in best for low
CPU usage. All of the competitors were EISA cards
and had IRQs and I/O addresses selectable with DIP
switches.

</p><p>
Before &ldquo;commercial open source&rdquo; became common,
&ldquo;commercial applications&rdquo; meant proprietary software.
A directory of commercial applications had 23 entries,
including five databases and three Motif ports.
</p><p>
One of the classic Linux books made its first
appearance. Grant Johnson reviewed the first edition
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Running Linux</em></span> by Matt Welsh and Lar Kaufman.
Besides installing Slackware, the book got readers
started with setting up a mail server and creating
a Web site&mdash;even writing HTML.
</p><p>
Galacticomm took out a full-page ad for its bulletin
board software product, The Major BBS. <i  >Linux Journal</i>
publisher Phil Hughes announced <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s
first Web site and offered advertisers links from
an on-line ad index, or &ldquo;if they don't have their
own Web site, for a nominal fee we will put their
Web pages on <a href="http://www.ssc.com" target="_self">www.ssc.com</a>.&rdquo; Out of the 47 ads in the
issue, 42 included an e-mail address, but only 13 had
a URL. (O'Reilly had e-mail, Web, telnet and Gopher
contact info&mdash;show-offs.)
