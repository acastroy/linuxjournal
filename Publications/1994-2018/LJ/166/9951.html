Linux software on Macintosh desktops with Linux renderfarms creates
Paramount movie.

A Linux-based production pipeline is a perfect choice for a major motion
picture like <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Spiderwick Chronicles</em></span>, with its many goblins and magical
creatures. Hollywood has been the realm of Linux since 1997, when the movie
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span> proved that Linux can do big computer graphics jobs like rendering
a sinking ocean liner. With an industry tradition of using UNIX-based
operating systems for high-computation jobs, and due to the better, faster,
cheaper nature of Linux, every major effects or animation movie today is
produced using Linux. Visual effects facilities ILM and Tippett Studio each
created visual effects for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Spiderwick</em></span>. Having multiple effects houses work
on the same movie became common after 2003 when <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix
Reloaded</em></span> used a
dozen effects houses.

Tippett Studio: Linux on Macintosh Desktops</h2></div></div><p>
The idea of switching Mac desktops to Linux is
new in the film industry.
The film industry routinely uses Macs running OS X for specialized tasks,
such as art department concept artwork generated using Adobe Photoshop, 
picture editing with Final Cut Pro and sound editing with ProTools.
When you scale past a few systems, the advantages of Linux for graphics
become apparent, and Linux graphics PC desktops are the norm. The
television series <span   class="emphasis"><em>South Park</em></span> is a notable exception, with Mac OS X desktops
running Maya with a Linux renderfarm. 
</p><p>
During the production of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Spiderwick</em></span>, Tippett Studio switched to Fedora
Linux running on Macintosh desktops. &ldquo;We currently have 119 Intel-based
Apple Mac Pro workstations running Linux&rdquo;, says Tippett Computer Graphics
Supervisor Russell Darling. &ldquo;We decided to go with Apple hardware running
Linux for our primary artist workstations on <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Spiderwick
Chronicles</em></span>,
although it might have been considered a risky endeavor for a show in
production. We initially had some problems with sound on Maya and a few
other minor issues, but they were resolved. We got a patch from Autodesk that
took care of everything.&rdquo; Commercial Linux software vendors work closely
with film studio clients.
</p><p>
Tippett chose Linux on Mac for many reasons. &ldquo;There's the ability to run
multiple operating systems, including Linux, OS X and Windows&rdquo;, says
Darling, and he continues, 
&ldquo;The systems are fast! That makes for more productive artists. The hardware
is quiet and energy-efficient. It's cost-effective, with a good cost per
rendermark [a renderfarm performance benchmark]. It's standardized
hardware. And, there's a good support plan. Although the majority of our
workstations run Linux, we have a handful of other systems running to
support specific software. We use the ability to boot in to other operating
systems, but the ultimate goal is to move to a simultaneous multi-OS
solution, such as Parallels.&rdquo;
</p><p>
To beat traditional alternatives, the Apple Mac Pro workstations had to
meet a specific set of Tippett requirements. They had to run Fedora FC4 and
XFS. They also had to run tools that Tippett uses, such as Maya with sound and
in-house and third-party plugins (MEL scripts), Apple Shake with in-house
and third-party plugins, SyFlex, cMuscle, RealFlow, JET, Flipper, rtTools
and cineSpace. Internally developed software uses Python, Perl and C/C++.
The platform must render frames identical to existing hardware. And, it has
to support necessary peripherals, especially tablets.

ILM: Mulgarath, Thimbletack, the Griffin, the Sprites and Stray
Sod</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;The important thing with a fantasy genre is referencing
nature&rdquo;, says ILM
Art Director Christian Alzmann. &ldquo;The Byron plumage is based on a red-tailed
hawk. We're always drawing reference from nature. I did the early design of
the Sprites with a bee next to them for scale, with two bees flying in
formation. Mulgarath is part man, part bull, part goat, part trees. The
warthog is a mean aggressive character, so we got pointy with him. And, he's
a lot more distorted. We also use scale cues, such as a Chiquita banana
sticker or Pepsi bottle cap.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;The Griffin has hair plus feathers and was rendered at 8k [images 8k pixels
wide] to get detail&rdquo;, says ILM Animation Supervisor Tim Harrington. To
achieve that level of detail meant 25- to 30-hour renders.
</p><p>
&ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Spiderwick</em></span> took 215 artists and 15
months&rdquo;, says ILM Visual Effects
Supervisor Tim Alexander. &ldquo;It has 341 shots, 30 minutes, with 224 3-D
shots.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Industrial Light &amp; Magic occupies the 865,000 square-foot Letterman Digital
Arts Center on the 23-acre San Francisco Presidio campus. Its data network
has more than 300 10GB ports and 1,500 1GB ports, with fibre
to every artist's desktop. There are 600 miles of cable throughout the four
buildings on the campus. A 13,500 square-foot data center houses a Linux
renderfarm with 3,000 AMD processors and more than 100TB of
storage. Proprietary render management tools add Linux desktop workstations
to the renderfarm pool after hours, expanding the processing capacity to
more than 5,000 processors.

Tippett Studio: Hogsqueal, the Troll, Red Cap and His Army of Goblins and
Bull Goblins</h2></div></div><p>
As Creature Supervisor for <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Spiderwick Chronicles</em></span>, visual effects
pioneer Phil Tippett oversaw the design and development of the film's
fantasy characters. &ldquo;Phil Tippett was on set with me every
day&rdquo;, says
Director Mark Waters. &ldquo;We were working on <span   class="emphasis"><em>Charlotte's
Web</em></span> when Mark Canton
gave us the script&rdquo;, says Tippett Studio Visual Effects Supervisor Joel
Friesch. &ldquo;When we saw the creatures, we had to do it. It's based on real
creatures, not fantasy. We wanted Hogsqueal. We created a bull goblin
marquette [a detailed statuette] that gave Mark something he could hold. The
bull goblin is based on toads. We brought in real toads and photographed
them. We created movies good for the animators, showing how the eyes move
and the
throat. We created a test scene with a goblin scratching the back of his
leg. That took one month of modeling and one month of animation.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9951f1.large.jpg"><img src="9951f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Tippett Studio's proprietary Creature Manager is used to
maintain a
library of creatures and animation cycles. The tool allows an artist to select and preview animation by
pressing the larger creature button, then selecting a combination of an
appropriate physical appearance for that creature from a predefined
library and placing any number of selected creatures into a Maya scene.
</p></div></div><p>
Hand animation is a challenging laborious process. &ldquo;One guy does blocking,
like moving chess pieces&rdquo;, says Tippett Studio Animation Supervisor Todd
Labonte. &ldquo;You get it approved. We watch it over and over. You can go blind.
We play it back in mirror image in our player or play it backward.&rdquo;
Labonte demonstrates playing back a scene of goblins invading the house,
shown in their Flipper playback software, which can display a mirror image
or play in reverse to help catch animation inconsistencies. Flipper is used
to view both QuickTime and image frame sequences of DPX, EXR or TIFF with
synchronized AIF audio. Flipper predates commercial Linux flipbooks, such
as
FrameCycler. At older studios, like Tippett, it's common to find proprietary
Linux tools created before commercial options were available. Tippett has a
team of eight Linux programmers to maintain and develop tools.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9951f2.large.jpg"><img src="9951f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Flipper is Tippett Studio's proprietary flipbook image viewing
tool.
 It allows an artist to view a series of individual image files as a
continuous sequence. It also can be synchronized with audio, which is
important for character animation. The artist can view the audio
waveform to help with lip synchronization, as seen in the lower part of
the screenshot. The tool also has a number of image and pixel
comparison and analysis features, as seen in the dialog on the upper
left. Post-camera moves can be previewed with Flipper before they are
actually applied in the composite stage.
</p></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Creature Picklist is a GUI-based Maya plugin for creatures that allows
animators to see visual representations of character, which they can select
for their scene&rdquo;, says Darling. &ldquo;In the case of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Spiderwick</em></span>, 'Goblin kits'
were created as combinations of variants and blendshapes. We have shots
that have more than 100 goblins. That's too many to animate using
traditional methods. The numbers are also too small to make a commercial
crowd system, such as Massive, a viable solution. We developed our own
system called Swarm. For the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Spiderwick</em></span> shots, we instanced around 150
goblins and managed animation clip data to animate them as
particles.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9951f3.large.jpg"><img src="9951f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Tippett Studio's Picklist allows an animator to select creature
variants from a library of different combinations of paint schemes and
body parts.

Figure 5. Tippett Studio's Picklist allows an animator to select specific
predefined poses for creatures, such as this bird.
</p></div></div><p>
Furocious is Tippett Studio's proprietary hair, fur and feather system.
It's a collection of plugins, scripts and executables used to place guide
geometry onto scalp surfaces, visualize fur as GL curves in Maya, and grow
procedural primitives at render/expansion time by interpolating neighboring
guides at predetermined follicle root locations.

RaveHD: Embedded Linux for Cinema Playback</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;We currently have six RaveHD systems at the studio&rdquo;, says Darling.
&ldquo;They're used to provide dailies in our screening rooms. We also use them
for smaller reviews and on-demand playback for artists in special viewing
rooms. And whenever we shoot with HD cameras on our stage, we use RaveHD to
acquire the images and bring them on-line as individual digital frame
files. We have been working with SpectSoft since 2002, before the RaveHD
product really existed. RaveHD is an awesome system. It has a really nice
design that allows it to integrate perfectly in our dailies
pipeline&mdash;very
reliable and easy to use&rdquo;. The RaveHD box is a Linux embedded system that
plays cinema-grade motion pictures at data rates that would choke a
PC.
</p><p>
&ldquo;I originally met [SpecSoft partners] Jason and Ramona Howard at a Linux
Movies meeting in Berkeley, shortly after I joined Tippett Studio&rdquo;, says
Darling. &ldquo;At that time, we were looking at developing a new dailies system.
They had developed a Linux driver for the AJA Kona HD/SD card and had
developed some DDR and editing tools. We were able to form a great
relationship with SpectSoft where we provided specifications and
requirements to them in order to help create a system that suited our
purposes.&rdquo; LinuxMovies.org is an association of Linux motion-picture
technologists founded in 2002 [by Robin Rowe, author of this article].

Tippett Studio: Linux Renderfarm</h2></div></div><p>
Tippett uses more than 1,200 processors in its renderfarm. &ldquo;Tippett
Studio has its own shading library built around the RenderMan Shading
Language. Our pipeline tools are also centered around the RIB interface. The
most important consideration for renderfarm configuration is that all jobs
submitted the night before must be finished by the next morning&rdquo;, says
Darling. &ldquo;Each morning we do dailies to review the previous day's work. If
the job is not finished, it can't be properly reviewed. There are
occasional exceptions for special shots that may run long, but for the most
part, we want everything to finish overnight.&rdquo; The Tippett renderfarm is
managed by a proprietary batch-scheduling software, so that each computer in
the farm is working on only one frame at a time. &ldquo;Our distributed rendering
system Batch-o-matic has been in use at the studio for ten years&rdquo;, says
Darling. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9951f6.large.jpg"><img src="9951f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Tippett Studio's renderfarm is managed by its proprietary
Batch-o-matic system. In its GUI interface, CPUs are represented as
circles with color-coded indications of their activity level and status.
Information about an artist's render jobs is represented by color-coded
squares indicating number of CPUs in use, as well as an overall status
bar. More detailed information is shown for a specific job, with status
for each task and frame.

Tippett Studio: Linux Python Pipeline</h2></div></div><p>
JET is a proprietary Python-based system comprising software tools and
scripts used to implement a visual effects and animation pipeline. &ldquo;A
visual effects and animation pipeline is an assembly line of software used
to organize, automate and facilitate the creation of computer-generated
imagery&rdquo;, says Darling. &ldquo;The JET tool is highly customizable, featuring
XML-based user-interface templates that can be modified to suit specific
types of artists or production needs. JET uses modular template chunks to
perform each of the tasks in the pipeline, such as rendering or
compositing. The templates are implemented as Python objects and are
centrally located. JET is not only implemented entirely in Python, but it's
also used to generate Python scripts automatically. These custom scripts
form unique pipelines for each computer graphics job to run on the renderfarm.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9951f7.large.jpg"><img src="9951f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. JET is Tippett Studio's proprietary tool for creating jobs that
are to
be submitted to the renderfarm. Each job comprises a series of
chunks (as shown in the panel on the left) that perform specific tasks,
such as making a RIB, growing fur, rendering with RenderMan and
compositing with Shake. The primary work area on the right provides an
interface for the selected chunk. 
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe1b580.0x130da60"></a>
Tippett Studio: Compositing with Apple Shake and Painting with
Photoshop</h2></div></div><p>
Tippett Studio uses Apple's Shake compositing software, which has been
discontinued. &ldquo;We took advantage of Apple's offer of selling the Shake
source code to us&rdquo;, says Darling. &ldquo;We don't plan on modifying it, but it is
good to have for an insurance policy. Shake is still very prominent in the
visual effects industry. It's useful to be able to share Shake projects
with other studios we're collaborating with. Shake has a really nice image-processing engine. In addition to standard compositing, we use it for all
kinds of image-processing solutions in our pipeline. The product is very
mature and feature-rich. It has support for plugins, which allows us to
develop and enhance compositing nodes whenever we need something new. We
don't have any current plans to switch compositing packages, but we're
always keeping an eye on what's out there.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;We use Photoshop CS as the painting interface for our texture painting, as
well as for matte paintings&rdquo;, says Darling. &ldquo;It's used directly on Windows
and Mac systems. Our goal is to use a system such as Parallels to permit
artists to run tools outside their primary operating system. Deep Paint
3D is used to paint textures for 3-D models. The actual painting is done
with Photoshop, but the interaction with the model is done in Deep
Paint.&rdquo;
Deep Paint and Photoshop are both non-Linux commercial tools. Some studios,
such as DreamWorks Animation, use Wine to run Photoshop on Linux. Another
option is to run an open-source Linux paint package that supports
industry-standard high-fidelity image formats DPX and OpenEXR (such as CinePaint).
However, Deep Paint on Wine is untried, and there's no open-source option. 
</p><p>
&ldquo;When painting in Photoshop, it is essential to be able to view the image
with the same type of color management used to produce the final rendered
image&rdquo;,
says Darling. &ldquo;Photoshop supports ICC profiles for color management. Since
we use cineSpace in the rest of the pipeline, we had a tool created that
would allow us to produce an ICC profile that matched the cineSpace
profile. We collaborated with Joseph Goldstone, who is a member of the
International Color Consortium (ICC) to create this tool.&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe1b580.0x130de28"></a>
Plentiful Commercial Linux Animation Tools</h2></div></div><p>
There are commercial Linux software tools available to Linux animators
beyond big packages like Maya. &ldquo;cMuscle is a system for simulating muscle
movement&rdquo;, says Darling. &ldquo;We used it for muscle jiggle, skin jiggle, skin
smoothing and sliding effects.
We use SyFlex for
the clothing worn by Red Cap and Hogsqueal. This system was augmented by
some custom cloth/deformation software developed at Tippett Studio.&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9951f8.large.jpg"><img src="9951f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Creature skin, muscles and skeletal structures&mdash;the green and yellow
images represent soft body jiggle maps. Along with the muscle
system, we also have what is called tension controls. These are
blendshapes of various body parts that when fired give those areas a
more flexed look, giving the illusion of the skin tightening.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9951f9.large.jpg"><img src="9951f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Creature muscles (red) and basic skeletal system (white). For this
creature, Tippett Studio's hair and fur system Furocious was used to
grow fur that had the appearance and behavior of grass, which is one of
the unique camouflaging features of this character.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9951f10.large.jpg"><img src="9951f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. Animation controls for the Troll.
</p></div></div><p>
&ldquo;cineSpace allows us to have a specific, consistent look on all viewing
devices that simulate our finaling medium&mdash;the look of the film that the
director is using for final shots&rdquo;, says Darling. &ldquo;Since film is still the
master format, this means a combination of a specific film stock and a
specific lab that is used to process and print that film. A cineSpace
profile allows us to produce an image digitally that has the same look and
characteristics of that same image if it were printed to film. It is
important that we are looking at the same thing that the director sees, as
well as what will eventually be seen in the theater.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;Tippett Studio's primary operating system is Linux&rdquo;, says
Darling. &ldquo;Open-source software is very important to us. In addition to it being a part of
our pipeline, we've contributed to a few projects over the years, such as
Pixie. Open source is also something that can enable standards. An example
of this would be the OpenEXR Project. We really needed a standardized
high-dynamic-range image format that was supported in commercial and open-source
CG software. The EXR image file format has now become a de facto standard
image file format in our industry, simply because it was
open-sourced.&rdquo;

The Creatures of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Spiderwick</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Spiderwick</em></span> all unexplained phenomena in the world are due to
fantastical creatures that are all around us&rdquo;, says director Mark Waters.
The movie is based on the best-selling series of children's books written
by Holly Black and illustrated by Tony DiTerlizzi. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Spiderwick
Chronicles</em></span> is a family adventure fantasy set at the dilapidated Spiderwick
Estate, constructed in Canada at Quebec's Cap-Ste-Jacques Nature park. 
</p><p>
The movie opens to wide release on February 15th, 2008. There's also a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Spiderwick</em></span> video game in development.
