The examples used here were not invented. This article is really, really
scary.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e6580.0x17de298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the first part of this article [<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, January 2008], we started the apparently simple journey of
navigating our way to the IP address of www.example.com and its
secure server online.example.com by traveling down the DNS hierarchy. We
finally received a referral from the gTLD .com servers pointing us to
the name servers ns2.example.com, an in-zone name server, and 
ns1.example.net, an out-of-zone (or out-of-bailiwick) name server.
</p><p>
So, let's restart our quest for the IP address of www.example.com and
assume we have verified and obtained the IP address of ns1.example.net,
which, because it is out-of-zone, we have tracked to its authoritative
source via the .net gTLD servers. Now, it's time to check all our
authoritative servers for the example.com domain to see what else we can
find. First we check the front door:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dig @ns1.example.net version.bind txt ch
</pre>
</p><p>
This command uses a legacy DNS resource record class called
CH(AOS)&mdash;Internet addresses use the IN class&mdash;to try to obtain information
about the software being used. We get this response:


<pre     class="programlisting">

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.4.1-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @ns1.example.net version.bind txt ch

...

;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 8503

;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:

;version.bind. CH TXT


;; ANSWER SECTION:

VERSION.BIND. 0 CH TXT "named 4.9.6-Rel-Tuesday-24-June-97..."


;; Query time: 25 msec

;; SERVER: 207.253.126.250#53(207.253.126.250)

...

</pre>
</p><p>
And, we got lucky. This name server is telling us the supplier and
version number of its software. If we were bad guys, we would go and look up
the alerts for this version of software and see if there were any juicy
vulnerabilities. In this case, the news is extremely good (for the bad
guys), because the server is running BIND 4, last updated in 1997!
Between 3% and 7% of all the estimated 9 million name servers in
operation still use this redundant software, which is full of bugs and
exploit possibilities. Let's assume we repeat the command, substituting
ns2.example.com&mdash;our second authoritative server&mdash;and we get back
&ldquo;my
name is Bind, James Bind&rdquo;. The administrator of this DNS has a sense of
humor and some knowledge of BIND configuration parameters. In the
options clause of BIND's named.conf file (normally in /etc/named.conf),
the following parameter will appear:

<pre     class="programlisting">
options {

...

version "my name is Bind, James Bind";

...

}
</pre>
</p><p>
You can place any text here, and it will be supplied in place of the
version number. If the statement is missing, BIND will return its version
number, as shown in the previous example. As we shall see, this may not
prevent us from discovering the information, but it does at least make it
more than a trivial one-line command. Finally, although BIND servers respond
to the above command, not all DNS software does, so we could have received
a timeout.
</p><p>
Now, it's time to move on to the next check. We're going to use the second of our
tools, fpdns, which is a DNS fingerprinting tool (see Part I of this article
for more information on fpdns). fpdns uses a range of benign techniques to try
to identify both
the software vendor and, in many cases, the release version or version
range. It is not infallible, but its accuracy is extremely good. Let's
use it to check our reluctant Mr Bind:


<pre     class="programlisting">
fpdns ns2.example.com
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e6580.0x17de920"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, we get the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
fingerprint (ns2.example.com, 10.10.0.2): ISC BIND 9.2.0rc7 -- 9.2.2-P3
[recursion enabled] 
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, this potentially is serious as well. First, the current version of
BIND at the time of this writing is 9.4.1-P1. So, we can simply check the security
alerts for the version range quoted and see whether we have some handy
poisoning possibilities. Second, this server is an open recursive
server, which means that any request for name resolution will be
accepted and acted on by this server, not only the names for which it is
authoritative. We could test this using a dig command like the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
dig @ns2.example.com some.obscure.domain
</pre>
</p><p>
Why are open resolvers a serious problem? There are three reasons. First, we
can load up the server for a simple Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack by
sending it requests for external name resolution. It will be so busy
following the referral chains that it will not have time to answer
requests for the domain for which it is authoritative&mdash;effectively taking
the domain off the air for at least a proportion of the traffic. Second,
it can be used in Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks. In this type of
attack,
requests are sent for the same name to many open name servers (there are
perhaps as many as one million open name servers on the Internet), each of
which then sends a query to the DoS target. No one single request breaks
any threshold monitoring, so it is difficult to identify all the sources. The
net effect is that the target DNS is bombarded with traffic and cannot
respond. Third, if I send a query to an open name server, I know what it
is going to do; it's going to send a query to the target domain's name
server. So, without even sniffing its traffic, I can start sending spoofed
responses, and if I get lucky, I can poison the open server's cache (there
are many documented weaknesses that I can exploit to 
increase my chances significantly). 
</p><p>
The function of a caching server is to save the
response until the Resource Record's TTL (Time to Live) expires and then
re-read the record. If the TTL for the requested RR is long (30 minutes
or more), I have a poisoning opportunity only every 30 minutes or
more, but if the TTL is short, say, five seconds or even zero
seconds, 
my odds of getting poisoned responses into the cache shoot up
dramatically. And, of course, my poisoned response will not have a TTL of
five seconds; it will be more like five weeks, so when it's there it stays there
for a long time. 
</p><p>
Now the real place to do this cache poisoning is not at
the authoritative name server. Instead, I would go looking for an open
recursive name server at an ISP and try to poison the cache using the
same technique, so that all the ISP's clients for www.example.com will
come to my pharming site.
</p><p>
All name servers should be closed to external traffic to stop this
behavior. If you are using BIND, there are three options:
</p><p>
1) If the name server is authoritative only (best practice recommends that
you never mix caching and authoritative functions in the same DNS), add
the following line to the /etc/named.conf file in the options clause:


<pre     class="programlisting">
options {

...

// BIND's default is recursion yes;

recursion no;

...

};
</pre>
</p><p>
2) If your server does provide both authoritative and recursive services,
limit who can use them by using the allow-recursion 
statement in an options clause:

<pre     class="programlisting">
options {

...

allow-recursion {192.168.2/24};

...

};
</pre>
</p><p>
This statement limits the allowable IP addresses permitted to make
recursive requests to 192.168.2.1&ndash;192.168.2.254. It is worth pointing
out that even if this statement is present, a recursive request from
outside the defined IP range will return the correct result if it
already exists in the cache (it previously was requested by a valid
internal user). BIND 9's view clause also can be used to
provide further control and separation in a mixed authoritative and
caching configuration.
</p><p>
3) Finally, if the server only provides caching services, use the
allow-query statement instead:

<pre     class="programlisting">
options {

...

allow-query {192.168.2/24};

};
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's continue with our checks by requesting the IP address of our
target from one of its authoritative servers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dig @ns1.example.net www.example.com
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e6580.0x17df000"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, we get this in response:


<pre     class="programlisting">

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.4.1-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @ns1.example.net www.example.com

...

;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 49319

;; flags: qr rd ra aa; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0


;; QUESTION SECTION:

;www.example.net. IN A


;; ANSWER SECTION:

www.example.com. 5 IN A 10.10.0.5

www.example.com. 5 IN A 10.10.0.6

;; Query time: 61 msec

;; SERVER: 192.5.6.30#53(192.5.6.30)

...

</pre>
</p><p>
There are a couple of things to note in this response. First, the aa
flag is set, which is what we would expect. If this flag is
not set, this would be what is called a lame-server (a server defined in
the parent as authoritative for a domain but that does not return the
aa flag to a query for information in that domain). The master
(primary) and slave (secondary) name servers for a domain must return
the aa flag. There is no externally visible difference between
master and slave server responses. This means you can use two or
more slave servers to provide authoritative service and keep your master
completely hidden. The second point to note is that the ra flag is set,
thus offering a recursion service. Let's test it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dig @dns1.example.net some.obscure.domain
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e6580.0x17df210"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And bingo, we get a response&mdash;this server is also open. The reason for
using some.obscure.domain is to make sure the data is not already cached,
in which case, depending on its configuration, the name server could
return the desired results and still be closed as noted previously.
Using an obscure name minimizes the possibility of a false positive. The
corollary is also true. If we fire a request for a popular domain name,
such as google.com, to an apparently closed DNS and get a valid result,
we know this server is providing recursive services for some set of
clients&mdash;unless of course it is the authoritative server for
google.com! This knowledge gives us some, very modest, poisoning
possibilities by looking at the TTL time of the response.
</p><p>
In passing, we also should note that the site sensibly has provided
two IP addresses, albeit both on the same IP address block. This means
that browsers automatically will fail over (in 2&ndash;3 minutes). If the
first server fails, it uses a five-second TTL, which, apart from being of
great assistance to potential cache poisoners, is entirely useless as
Microsoft's browser will attempt to refresh its browser-cached IP
addresses only every 30 minutes (one minute for Firefox).
</p><p>
So, ns1.example.net is using old, buggy software and is open. Can it
get worse? Well, yes it can, and indeed, in this case, it does get worse.
</p><p>
So far, we have been emulating what a browser does and simply looking
for ARRs; dig can be used to find any type of RR. In this case, the
absence of an AUTHORITY SECTION is a tad suspicious, so let's
experiment and try this command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
dig @ns1.example.net www.example.com ns
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16e6580.0x17df478"></a></h2></div></div><p>
And, we get this response:


<pre     class="programlisting">

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.4.1-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @ns1.example.net www.example.com ns

...

;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 49319

;; flags: qr rd ra aa; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 2

;; QUESTION SECTION:

;; ANSWER SECTION:

www.example.com. 3000 IN NS ns4.example.com.


;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:

</pre>
</p><p>
This result means that the user is trying to delegate www.example.com to
an alternate set of DNS servers, ns3 and ns4.example.com, but the
delegation is invalid, so the defined DNS servers are
not visible. The zone file probably has this construct:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ORIGIN example.com.

...

; these A RRs should not be present in the example.com

; zone file but should be present in a www.example.com zone file

www 5 IN A 10.10.0.5

www 5 IN A 10.10.0.5

; valid delegation for www.example.com

www 3000 IN NS ns3.example.com.

www 3000 IN NS ns4.example.com.

...

; required glue RRs for the delegation

ns3.example.com. 3000 IN A 10.10.0.8

ns3.example.com. 3000 IN A 10.10.0.9
</pre>
</p><p>
BIND 9 (used by ns2.example.com) correctly will interpret this as a
delegation and generate a referral to ns3 and ns4.example.com. BIND 4
(ns1.example.net) will not, and thus, approximately 50% of the traffic
will never even see the delegated servers, which if we perform our checks
using the above techniques, we would see are solidly configured and using
the latest versions of BIND (similarly with the name servers for
online.example.com).
</p><p>
In summary, this user configured and maintained his or her internal name servers
with great care and in a thoroughly professional manner but had entirely
overlooked the route by which users arrived at the site. To put it
another way, the castle was impregnable, the moat wide and deep,
the walls thick, the defenses manned, but the front door wide open.
</p><p>
This problem may look pretty far-fetched, but it was real, took less than
ten minutes to find and&mdash;in case you were wondering&mdash;is now fixed!
</p><p>
When performing this kind of analysis, you will develop your own methods
and variations, but here are some things to look for that seem to make
organizations especially vulnerable:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Multiple domain names, for instance, example.com, secure-example.com and
online-example.com, tend to make managing and monitoring more complex for
the operator and, hence, are more likely to have DNS configuration errors.
</p></li><li><p>
Backroom domains&mdash;many organizations elect to use unique domain names,
for instance, support-example.com, to perform infrastructure functions,
such as running their internal DNS systems, that are not visible to
end users. For some strange reason, many of these organizations think
end-user invisibility also applies to the DNS system.
</p></li><li><p>
Many DNS servers&mdash;the more DNS servers, the more likely it is that at least one of
them is running either badly configured or unpatched software.
</p></li><li><p>
BIND 8 and open is a very common ISP configuration. BIND 8 is pretty
buggy, represents approximately 20% of all DNS servers and is now
officially deprecated. Whoopee for the bad guys.
</p></li><li><p>
Always follow the transitive trust routes. The more there are, the more
likely you are to find a problem.
</p></li><li><p>
Outsourced DNS&mdash;there are highly professional DNS organizations to whom
many large users subcontract a provision of DNS service and whose DNS
configurations are invariably in very good shape. Many organizations use
the outsourced DNS to delegate to internal DNS systems. These users can
exhibit the exact opposite characteristics of the example case&mdash;the
internal name servers are a disaster. Further, in a surprising number of
cases, even when outsourced, there is one internal name server or that of
a local service provider on the primary authoritative list&mdash;almost
invariably this additional name server has a problem.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The techniques used here are not aggressive; for example, they do not test
for AXFR (zone transfer) vulnerability, because this not a friendly action
and is likely to generate nasty responses, quite rightly, from DNS
administrators. Treading lightly is the best technique.
</p><p>
We used a very small subset of dig's capability here. Read the man pages for
more information. If you do find something suspicious or wrong, double-check,
then either fix it immediately or, if it affects a third party, act
responsibly and inform the relevant organization (though it is
sometimes extremely difficult to get through to the right person).
Theoretically, the SOA RR of the domain in question should contain the
valid e-mail address of the right person in the organization.
</p><p>
I encourage you to experiment and modify the techniques for diagnosing
and auditing your DNS systems&mdash;it will pay dividends time and time
again&mdash;it's best that you get there before the bad guys. And, it can provide
endless hours of fun as you sleuth around.
