How to use OpenVPN to take your hosting to the next level.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1181580.0x12792f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Have you ever needed to expand your colocated servers at more than one
provider and allow applications to communicate as if they were on the
same LAN, possibly over multiple sets of firewalls and layers of NAT? Or,
maybe you've wanted to move from one hosting service to another to take
advantage of lower pricing or better uptime but would have preferred to do it
gradually instead of in a single swoop (and a weekend-long maintenance
window)? Or, maybe you've considered the Amazon EC2 cloud to host part, but not
all, of your infrastructure? If your answer to any of these questions is
yes, what you want is essentially a multisourced infrastructure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1181580.0x12794a8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>The Amazon EC2</b></p><p>
The Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a Web service that allows users
to provision new machines in an Amazon-hosted virtualized infrastructure
in a matter of minutes, using a publicly available API. Users get full
root access and can install almost any OS or application in their Amazon
Machine Images. Web service APIs allow users to reboot their instances
remotely and scale capacity quickly if necessary, by adding tens or even
hundreds of machines. Additionally, there is no up-front hardware setup
costs&mdash;Amazon charges only for the capacity you actually use; there is
no minimum fee. As more applications find their way to Amazon's virtual
computing environment, system administrators are looking for ways to
provide secure connectivity over the public Internet between new machines
in the Amazon EC2 and old machines in their regular data centers. This
article describes one such technique&mdash;how to
build a multisourced infrastructure based on OpenVPN. 
</p></div><p>
Let's take a look at a simple distributed application, which consists of
multiple services, a LAMP stack. Traditionally, you would start
with Apache and MySQL on a single server. As your site grows, you would
provision another server from your provider and add a second Apache
instance. Later, you might want to provision yet another machine to
be a dedicated database server to improve performance. This is a typical
single-sourced infrastructure&mdash;all services run within a single
physical environment, controlled and supported by a single provider.
</p><p>
In contrast, with a multisourced infrastructure, you
no longer are limited to one
provider or one data center. You are free to mix and match
hosting plans from different providers to suit your business and
architecture better, and you can use as many providers as you like. Your applications
still can communicate with one another, but instead of having a physical LAN,
it's now a virtual LAN that sits on top of public Internet links. You
can grow your services horizontally and achieve better geographic
redundancy and fault tolerance at the same time, all without
significant changes in your application. If it works in a single-sourced physical LAN, it most
likely will work in multisourced virtual
LAN as well. 
</p><p>
Additionally, you can leverage the strengths of a particular
provider for just a subset of your services. Going back to the LAMP stack
as our example, with Amazon EC2, you can provision many Apache
instances in response to the current load quickly; although you might prefer to run
MySQL on bare metal elsewhere instead of in an EC2 virtual machine. 
</p><p>
Finally, this method allows you to expand your corporate infrastructure
outside your current data center or allow outside services to use
applications in your corporate data center. Consider a remotely hosted
data-crunching cluster that you rent by the hour, which uses your
corporate data warehouse system for its input. As you can see,
a multisourced infrastructure is more flexible and can accommodate various
scenarios and needs.

Figure 1. Multisourced Infrastructure: OpenVPN Virtual Links
</p></div></div><p>
In this article, I describe a particular implementation of the multisourced
infrastructure concept that we at CohesiveFT (<a href="http://www.cohesiveft.com" target="_self">www.cohesiveft.com</a>)
developed using OpenVPN and
that has been running in our production environment since mid-summer
2007. We chose OpenVPN primarily because it uses standard OpenSSL
encryption, runs on multiple operating systems and does not require
kernel patching or additional modules. The latter benefit is of key
importance. Many Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting
solutions currently provide great service with pricing that is often
better than other forms of hosting. These providers build guest OS
kernels specifically tailored for their environment and method of
virtualization. As a result, you probably want to avoid rebuilding the Linux
kernel on your VPS as much as possible. Not that it can't be done,
but you can save some time and probably get faster technical support if
you don't do it. 
</p><p>
Among the alternatives to OpenVPN, there is Openswan, a code
fork of the original FreeS/WAN Project, but it requires a kernel patch to
support NAT traversal, according to its wiki 
(<a href="http://wiki.openswan.org/index.php/Openswan/Install" target="_self">wiki.openswan.org/index.php/Openswan/Install</a>). 
</p><p>
The OpenVPN protocol
also is firewall-friendly, as it can pass all traffic over a single UDP
tunnel (the default port is 1194). That feature, coupled with SSL
encryption, makes this solution very difficult to attack when data
packets pass through the public Internet.
</p><p>
OpenVPN turned out to be a great choice and offered us all the functionality
we expected, except for one very important feature, fault tolerance.
When you use a VPN to provide corporate network access to remote users,
the solution is very simple&mdash;you deploy several OpenVPN servers and
configure each server with its own network segment (for example, <tt  >server
10.5.0.0 255.255.0.0</tt> and <tt  >server 10.6.0.0 255.255.0.0</tt>).
In a typical
scenario, the dynamic IP address assigned to a remote user will not matter
much, as long as you configure firewalls, applications and services to
allow both subnets.
</p><p>
When you build a multisourced infrastructure, however, this is not an
acceptable solution, unless you want servers to change their IP
addresses from time to time. To satisfy redundancy and fault-tolerance
requirements, we needed an active-active pair of OpenVPN servers to
share a common address space&mdash;all hosts must be able to access each other
by static IP addresses at all times, no matter which OpenVPN server
provides connectivity at either end of the communication. Then, if we lose
one OpenVPN server, the other will provide all connectivity. And, if they
are both up, both will be accepting connections from clients to share
the load. This feature was not available as a part of the OpenVPN source
distribution, so we developed a standalone dynamic routing d&aelig;mon to
facilitate active-active load balancing. You can find its source code,
along with useful links, use-case scenarios and mailing lists, at
<a href="http://www.cohesiveft.com/multisourced-infra" target="_self">www.cohesiveft.com/multisourced-infra</a>.

Building Your Virtual LAN</h2></div></div><p>
You need two machines to run the OpenVPN d&aelig;mon in server mode (we
refer to them as vpnsrvA and vpnsrvB, and let's assume their physical IP
addresses in your network are 192.168.7.1 and 192.168.17.1,
respectively) and two new private subnets: data (for example,
10.100.100.0/24) and management (10.200.200.0/24). All of your applications
and services will run in the data subnet, and vpnsrvA and vpnsrvB will exchange
runtime status and routing information in the management subnet. Think of
these two machines as virtual network switches for your virtual LAN. Also,
note that these subnets do not have to be class C; you can choose a
bigger data network, especially if you are planning to connect a large
number of hosts.

Configure vpnsrvA and vpnsrvB as OpenVPN servers for the data subnet
(Listings 1a and 1b). You may add more configuration options as needed. Note that
the &ldquo;server&rdquo; line in the configuration file is a shortcut and cannot be used
for both vpnsrvA and vpnsrvB. It actually expands to a set of commands
that would have assigned 10.100.100.1 to both servers (see
the OpenVPN man page for more details). We want an active-active
configuration; therefore, we need vpnsrvA and vpnsrvB to be in the same
subnet but to have different IP addresses. To accomplish this, we
explicitly expand the server definition for vpnsrvB and assign it
the 10.100.100.101 IP address. 
</p><p>
Another important note is that the client
configuration directory (usually called ccd) and keys directory (called
keys) need to be identical on both vpnsrvA and vpnsrvB. One of the 
easiest ways to accomplish this is to use rsync. rsync allows us to keep
it simple and avoid extra variables in the mix. Plus, we always
can switch the direction of rsync and promote either of the servers to be
the master. For now, let's assume that vpnsrvA is the master and that vpnsrvB
mirrors the ccd and keys directories from vpnsrvA using rsync. You will
create keys (preferably using the easy-rsa package that ships with OpenVPN)
and update the ccd entries on the master server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1181580.0x127a4d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
At this point, you can configure several hosts on your network as OpenVPN
clients (Listing 2). Each host will have its own certificate/key pair,
and the ifconfig-push directive in the ccd entry for this host will set its IP
address (see Resources for a link to the OpenVPN HOWTO for a detailed explanation of how to set it
up). We tie the virtual IP address to a host based on its certificate/key
pair, in much the same way as in a DHCP configuration you would tie an IP
address to a host based on its Ethernet MAC address. Therefore, each
client must have its own unique certificate/key pair. 
</p><p>
Note that we use
OpenVPN's built-in capability to round-robin between multiple servers and
reconnect after connectivity failures, which is controlled by the keepalive
option. Once this is done, you should be able to start the OpenVPN clients,
and they should at least be able to communicate with their current
OpenVPN server and refer to it by IP&mdash;10.100.100.1 or 10.100.100.101.
If your client connects to vpnsrvA and you bring down the openvpn d&aelig;mon on
vpnsrvA, the client will detect it and automatically reconnect to vpnsrvB.
</p><p>
A quick note about firewalls&mdash;in a virtual LAN, your main data interface
will be called tun0. Therefore, all the rules you used to define for
interface eth0 in a single-sourced configuration will need to be
redefined for tun0. The Ethernet interface, however, will require additional
rules to allow UDP on port 1194 (OpenVPN) from the client machines to both
vpnsrvA and vpnsrvB.
</p><p>
The setup that we already have accomplished is somewhat fault-tolerant.
If vpnsrvA becomes unavailable, all clients will reconnect to vpnsrvB,
and connectivity will be restored. In other words, this is
active-passive redundancy. But, what will happen if both vpnsrvA and
vpnsrvB are up? Let's assume that host1 and host2 run the openvpn d&aelig;mon in
client mode. host1 connected to vpnsrvA and was assigned 10.100.100.25;
host2 connected to vpnsrvB and was assigned 10.100.100.41. The routing table
on vpnsrvA is shown in Listing 3. In this scenario, when host1 attempts
to ping 10.100.100.101, its outgoing packets will be routed first to
vpnsrvA but then will go back to the same tun0 interface, because
vpnsrvA does not know about the existence of vpnsrvB. Similarly, when host1
attempts to ping host2, vpnsrvA also will send these packets back, as
indicated by the 10.100.100.0/24 route. As a result, both operations will fail.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1181580.0x127a840"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

</pre></div><p>
To address this issue, we developed a dynamic routing d&aelig;mon 
called cube-routed (download it from
<a href="http://www.cohesiveft.com/multisourced-infra" target="_self">www.cohesiveft.com/multisourced-infra</a>). It shares routing
information between vpnsrvA and vpnsrvB and adjusts routing tables
depending on which client connects to which server in near real time.
Its internal structure is not very complex. One thread connects to a
local OpenVPN d&aelig;mon process via its management interface (see
the management option in the OpenVPN configuration file) and regularly runs
the status command to update the list of clients connected locally. Another
thread publishes this information for the remote instance of cube-routed.
The third thread regularly reads a list of connected clients from the remote
instance of cube-routed. Finally, the fourth thread adjusts the local
routing table based on the following two rules: 1) adds a host route for
every host connected to the remote OpenVPN server and 2) deletes the host route for
every host connected to the local OpenVPN server.
</p><p>
cube-routed instances will exchange information over the management subnet
we selected earlier. Create a second tunnel tun1 between vpnsrvA
and vpnsrvB. vpnsrvA can be a server with IP 10.200.200.1, and vpnsrvB is
its client with IP 10.200.200.5. You can use the configuration files from
Listings 1 and 2 as a basis, but remember to adjust the IP addresses and
select a different port&mdash;for example, you could add <tt  >port
11940</tt> to
both the server and client. Start both OpenVPN d&aelig;mons, and use
<tt  >ping
10.200.200.1</tt> and <tt  >ping 10.200.200.5</tt> to verify connectivity between them.
</p><p>
Now, create configuration files for cube-routed on both vpnsrvA and
vpnsrvB, as shown in Listings 4a and 4b, and start both instances as root with the path
to the configuration file as the only parameter (note that OpenVPN must
already be running, and the tun0/tun1 interfaces on both vpnsrvA and vpnsrvB
must be up).

</pre></div><p>
Once you start everything and after several minutes of initial
convergence time, host1 from the example above will be able to communicate
with host2, even though they connected to different OpenVPN servers. 
Thus, you've achieved a fully fault-tolerant virtual LAN connectivity, with
data traffic encryption as an added bonus.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This implementation is not without its limitations. First,
applications that use broadcast or multicast will not work with
OpenVPN's tun device. You can use the same network layout as described
here, but instead of tun, experiment with OpenVPN's tap device to work
around this. Second, latency of network links over the public Internet is
significantly higher than that of Ethernet. If this is an inherent
requirement for your application, you probably should leave this part of
your infrastructure single-sourced. Third, because we use UDP-based
tunnels, OpenVPN links will tend to go up and down more often than
Ethernet, especially during times of network congestion. You can
implement data caches, avoid long-lived TCP connections, focus on
network exception-handling logic and experiment with TCP tunnels to
reduce negative impact. Finally, there are exactly two OpenVPN servers in
this setup. This generally should be sufficient, as it doesn't affect
the number of actual hosts that you have connected to your multisourced
infrastructure. If for some reason you need more than two, it becomes much
more difficult to implement route sharing among cube-routed instances.
In that case, you might want to consider a messaging system instead of
raw sockets (for example, RabbitMQ). All in all, in our case, we found
that the overall benefits of a multisourced infrastructure far outweighed
the problems caused by these limitations, particularly if you design your
architecture with these limitations in mind.
</p><p>
Multisourced infrastructure is a logical extension of its single-sourced
predecessor, similar to the distributed service-oriented architecture, which
came after monolithic applications and enabled greater flexibility,
a faster development cycle and higher availability. It can help you design
a smarter architecture and avoid a lock-in to a single hosting provider,
on top of a standard time-tested open-source OpenVPN.
