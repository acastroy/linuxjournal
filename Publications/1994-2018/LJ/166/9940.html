Strategies for reducing Linux's footprint, leaving more resources
for the application or letting engineers further reduce the
hardware cost of the device.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18e4298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;How small can you make this?&rdquo; is a question frequently heard by embedded
engineers at the start of their projects. Most of the time, the person
asking this question is concerned with reducing the RAM and Flash resources with the
goal of reducing a device's unit costs or energy requirements.
</p><p>
Because Linux, and the surrounding environment, originally was intended
for desktop or server systems, its default configuration isn't optimized
for size. However, as Linux is finding itself in more embedded devices,
making Linux &ldquo;small&rdquo; isn't as daunting a task as it once was. There are
several different approaches for reducing the memory footprint of
a system.
</p><p>
Many engineers start by reducing the size of the kernel; however, there
is lower-hanging fruit at hand. This article goes into detail about
how to reduce the size of the kernel, mostly by removing code that won't
even be used in a typical embedded system.
</p><p>
A root filesystem (RFS) can be the largest consumer of memory resources in
a system. A root filesystem contains the infrastructure code used by
an application as well as the C library. Selecting the filesystem
used for the RFS itself can have a large effect on the final size.
The standard, ext3, is frightfully inefficient on several axes from an
embedded engineer's perspective, but that's a topic for another article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18e4660"></a>
Realistically, How Small?</h2></div></div><p>
Even the smallest Linux distribution has at least two parts: a kernel and
root filesystem. Sometimes, these components are colocated in the same
file, but they're still separate and distinct components. By removing nearly
all features from the kernel (networking, error logging and support for
most devices) and making the root filesystem just the application, the
size of a system easily can be less than 1MB. However, many users choose
Linux for the networking and device support, so this isn't a realistic
scenario.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18e4768"></a>
Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux kernel is interesting in that although it depends on GCC during
compilation time, it has no dependencies at runtime. Those engineers
new to Linux confuse the initial RAM disk (so-called initrd) with a
kernel runtime dependency. The initrd is mounted first by the kernel,
and a program runs that interrogates the system in order to figure out what
modules need to be loaded in order to support the devices, so that the
&ldquo;real&rdquo; root filesystem can be mounted. In fact, the two-step mounting,
the initrd followed by the real root filesystem, rarely finds its way into
embedded systems as the gain in flexibility in a system that does change
isn't worth the additional space or time. But, this topic falls under the
rubric of the root filesystem and is discussed later in this article.
</p><p>
Most of the effort in reducing kernel size lies in removing what's not
needed. Because the kernel is configured for desktop and server systems,
it has many features enabled that wouldn't be used in an embedded system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18e4978"></a>
Loadable Module Support</h2></div></div><p>
Kernel loadable modules are re-locatable code that the kernel links
into itself at runtime. The typical use cases for loadable modules are
allowing drivers to be loaded into the kernel from user space (typically
after some probing process) and allowing the upgrade of device drivers
without taking down the system. For most embedded systems, once they're
out in the field, changing the root filesystem is either impractical or
impossible, so the system's designer links the modules directly into
the kernel, removing the need for loadable modules. The space-saving in
this area isn't limited to the kernel, however, as the programs managing
loadable modules (such as insmod, rmmod and lsmod) and the shell script to load
them aren't necessary.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18e4a80"></a>
Linux-tiny Patches</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux-tiny set of patches has been an on-again-off-again project that
originally was spearheaded by Matt Mackall. The Consumer Electronics
Linux Forum (CELF) has put effort into reviving the project, and the
CELF Developer's Wiki has patches for the 2.6.22.5 kernel (at the
time of this writing). In the meantime, many of the changes
in the Linux-tiny Project have been included in the mainline kernel.
Even if many of the original Linux-tiny patches have made it into the
kernel, some substantial space-saving patches haven't, such as:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Fine-grain printk support: users can have control over what files can
use printk. This allows engineers to reap the size benefits of excluding
printk for the kernel at large while still having access to their favorite
debugger in the places where it's needed most.
</p></li><li><p>
Change CRC from calculation to use table lookup: Ethernet
packets require a CRC to validate the integrity of the packet.
This implementation of the CRC algorithm uses table lookups instead of
calculations, saving about 2K.
</p></li><li><p>
Network tweaking: several patches reduce the supported network
protocols, buffer sizes and open sockets. Many embedded devices support
only a few protocols and don't need to service thousands of connections.
</p></li><li><p>
No panic reporting: if the device has three status lights and a serial
connection, the user won't be able to see, much less act on, panic information
that appears on a (nonexistent console). If the device has a kernel panic
failure, the user simply will power-cycle the device.
</p></li><li><p>
Reduction of inlining: an inline is where the compiler, instead of
generating a call to a function, treats it as a macro, putting a copy
of the code in each place it is called. Although the inline directive
is technically a hint, GCC will inline any function by default.
By suppressing inline functions, the code runs slightly slower, as the
compiler needs to generate code for a call and return; in exchange, however,
the object file is smaller.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The Linux-tiny patches are distributed in a tar archive that can be
applied with the quilt utility or applied individually.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18e4fa8"></a>
Additional Kernel Tweaking Recommendations</h2></div></div><p>
Although the Linux-tiny Project covers a lot of ground, 
several additional configuration changes will result in substantial
footprint reductions:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Remove ext2/3 support and use a different filesystem: the ext2/3 filesystem
is large, a little more than 32K. Most engineers enable a Flash filesystem, but don't disable ext2/3, wasting memory in the process.
</p></li><li><p>
Remove support for sysctl: sysctl allows the user to tweak kernel
parameters at runtime. In most embedded devices, the kernel configuration
is known and won't change, making this feature a wasted 1K.
</p></li><li><p>
Reduce IPC options: most systems can do without SysV IPC features
(grep your code for msgget, msgct, msgsnd and msgrcv) and POSIX message
queues (grep for mq_*[a-z]), and removing them scores another 18K.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18e5318"></a>
Seeing the Effect of Your Changes</h2></div></div><p>
The size command reports the amount of code and data in an object
file. This is different from the output of the ls command, which reports
the number of bytes in the filesystem.
</p><p>
For example, a kernel compiled with an armv5l cross-compiler reports
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# armv5l-linux-size vmlinx

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
2080300   99904   99312 2279516  22c85c vmlinux
</pre>
</p><p>
The text section is the code (discovering the historical reason the
code is in the text section is an exercise left to the reader) emitted
by the compiler. The data section contains the values for globals and
other values used to initialize static symbols. The bss section
contains static data that is zeroed out as part of initialization.
</p><p>
Although this data is revealing, it doesn't show what parts of the system
are consuming memory. There isn't a way to query vmlinux for that
information, but looking at the files linked together to create vmlinux
is the next best thing. To get this information, use find to locate
the built-in.o files in the kernel project and pass those results to size:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# find . -name "built-in.o" | xargs armv5l-linux-size 
 &#8618;--totals | sort -n -k4
</pre>
</p><p>
The output of this command is similar to the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
 189680   16224   33944  239848   3a8e8 ./kernel/built-in.o
 257872   10056    5636  273564   42c9c ./net/ipv4/built-in.o
 369396    9184   34824  413404   64edc ./fs/built-in.o
 452116   15820   11632  479568   75150 ./net/built-in.o
 484276   36744   14216  535236   82ac4 ./drivers/built-in.o
3110478  180000  159241 3449719  34a377 (TOTALS) 
</pre>
</p><p>
This technique makes spotting code that occupies a large amount of
space obvious, so engineers working on a project can remove those
features first. When taking this approach, users shouldn't forget to
do a clean make between builds, as dropping a feature from the kernel
doesn't mean that the object file from the prior build will be deleted.
</p><p>
For those new to the Linux kernel, a common question is how to associate
some built-in.o file with an option in the kernel configuration program.
This can be done by looking at the Makefile and the Kconfig file in
the directory. The Makefile will contain a line that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
obj-$(CONFIG_ATALK)     += p8022.o psnap.o
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18e57e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which will result in the files on the right-hand side being built when
the user sets the configuration variable CONFIG_ATALK. However, the
kernel configuration tool typically doesn't readily expose the underling
configuration variable names. To find the link between the variable
name and what's visible, look for the variable name, sans the CONFIG_,
in the files (Kconfig) used to drive the kernel configuration editor:

<pre     class="programlisting">
find . -name Kconfig -exec fgrep -H -C3 "config ATALK" {} \;
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18e5948"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which produces the following output:


<pre     class="programlisting">
./drivers/net/appletalk/Kconfig-#
./drivers/net/appletalk/Kconfig-# Appletalk driver configuration
./drivers/net/appletalk/Kconfig-#
./drivers/net/appletalk/Kconfig:config ATALK
./drivers/net/appletalk/Kconfig-  tristate "Appletalk protocol support"
./drivers/net/appletalk/Kconfig-        select LLC
./drivers/net/appletalk/Kconfig-        ---help---
</pre>
</p><p>
There's still some hunting to do, as the user needs to find where &ldquo;Appletalk
protocol support&rdquo; appears in the configuration hierarchy, but at least
there's a clear idea of what's being sought.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18e5bb0"></a>
Root Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>
For many embedded engineers new to Linux, the notion of a root filesystem
on an embedded device is a foreign concept. Embedded solutions before
Linux worked by linking the application code directly into the kernel.
Because Linux has a well-defined separation between the kernel and root
filesystem, the work on minimizing the system doesn't end with making the
kernel small. Before optimization, the size of the root filesystem
dwarfs that of the kernel; however, in the Linux tradition, this part of
the system has many knobs to turn to reduce the size of this
component.
</p><p>
The first question to answer is &ldquo;Do I need a root filesystem at
all?&rdquo; In short, yes. At the end of the kernel's startup process, it
looks for a root filesystem, which it mounts and runs the first process (usually
init; doing <tt  >ps aux | head -2</tt> will tell you what it
is on your system).
In the absence of either the root filesystem or the initial program,
the kernel panics and stops running.
</p><p>
The smallest root filesystem can be one file: the application
for the device. In this case, the init kernel parameter points to a
file and that is the first (and only) process in userland. So long
as that process is running, the system will work just fine. However,
if the program exits for any reason, the kernel will panic, stop running, and the
device will require a reboot. For that reason alone, even the most
space-constrained systems opt for an init program. For a very small overhead,
init includes the code to respawn a process that dies, preventing a kernel
panic in the event of an application crash.
</p><p>
Most Linux systems are more complex, including several executable files
and frequently shared libraries containing code shared by applications
running on the device. For these filesystems, several options exist
to reduce the size of the RFS greatly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18dc758"></a>
Change the C Library</h2></div></div><p>
Combined with GCC, most users don't think of the C library as a separate
entity. The C language contains only 32 keywords (give or take a few), so
most of the bytes in a C program are those from the standard library.
The canonical C library, glibc, has been designed for compatibility,
internationalization and platform support rather than size. However,
several alternatives exist that have been engineered from inception to
be small:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
uClibc:
this project started as an implementation of the C library for processors
without a memory management unit (MMU-less). uClibc was
created from the beginning to be small while supplying the same
functionality of glibc, by dropping features like internationalization,
wide character support and binary compatibility. Furthermore, uClibc's
configuration utility gives users great freedom in selecting what
code goes into the library, allowing users to reduce the size further.
</p></li><li><p>
uClibc++:
for those using C++, this library is implemented under the same
design principles. With support for most of the C++ standard library,
engineers easily can deploy C++-based applications onboard with only
a few megabytes.
</p></li><li><p>
Newlib:
Newlib grew out of Red Hat's foray into the embedded market. Newlib has
a very complete implementation of the math library and therefore finds
favor with users doing control or measurement applications. 
</p></li><li><p>
dietlibc:
still the smallest of the bunch, dietlibc is the best kept secret
among replacements for glibc. Extremely small, 70K small in fact,
dietlibc manages to be small by dropping features, such as dynamically
linked libraries. It has excellent support for ARM and MIPS.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18dcb78"></a>
Using an Alternate C Library</h2></div></div><p>
Both Newlib and dietlibc work by providing a wrapper script that
invokes the compiler with the proper set of parameters to ignore the
regular C libraries included with the compiler and instead use the ones
specified. uClibc is a little different as it requires that the
toolchain be built from source, supplying tools to do the job in the
buildroot project.
</p><p>
Once you know how to invoke GCC so it uses the right compiler, the
next step is updating the makefiles or build scripts for the project.
In most cases, the build for the project resides in a makefile with a
line that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CC=CROSS_COMPILE-gcc 
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, all the user needs to do is run <tt  >make</tt> and override
the CC variable from the command line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make CC=dietc 
</pre>
</p><p>
This results in the makefile invoking diet for the C compiler.
Although it's tempting, don't add parameters into this macro; instead, use the
CFLAGS variable.
For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make CC="gcc -Os"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18dcee8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
should be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make CC=gcc CFLAGS="-Os"
</pre>
</p><p>
This is important, because some rules will invoke CC for things other than
compilation, and the parameters will not make sense and result in an error.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18dd0a0"></a>
Back to the Root Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>
After selecting the C library, all of the code in the root filesystem needs
to be compiled with the new compiler, so that code can take advantage
of the newer, smaller C library. At this point, it's worth evaluating
whether static versus shared libraries are the right choice for the target.
Shared libraries work best if the device will have arbitrary code running
and if that code isn't known at the time of deployment; for example, the
device may expose an API and allow end users or field engineers to
write modules. In this case, having the libraries on the device would
afford the greatest flexibility for those implementing new features.
</p><p>
Shared libraries also would be a good choice if the system contained
many separate programs instead of one or two programs. In this case,
having one copy of the shared code would be smaller than the same code
duplicated in several files.
</p><p>
Systems with a few programs merit closer consideration. When only a few
programs are in use, the best thing to do is create a system each way and
compare the resulting size. In most cases, the smaller system
is the one with no shared libraries. As an added benefit, systems without
shared libraries load and start running programs faster (as there's no
linking step), so users benefit from an efficiency perspective as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17ec580.0x18dd258"></a>
Summary</h2></div></div><p>
Although there's no magic tool for making a system smaller, there is
no shortage of tools to help make a system as small as possible.
Furthermore, making Linux &ldquo;small&rdquo; is more than reducing the size of the
kernel; the root filesystem needs to be examined critically and paired
down, as this component usually consumes more space than the
kernel. This article concentrated on the executable image size;
reducing the memory requirements of the program once it is running constitutes a
separate project.
