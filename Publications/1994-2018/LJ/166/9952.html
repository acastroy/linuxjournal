Dave completes his explanation of writing a helpful interactive command-line calculator as a shell script.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18db580.0x19d3450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Ooops! Two months ago, I started exploring how you can write a simple but
quite helpful interactive command-line calculator as a shell script and
ended the column with &ldquo;Next month, we'll dig into useful refinements and
make it a full-blown addition to our Linux toolkit. See you then!&rdquo;
</p><p>
Unfortunately, last month, I got sidetracked with the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Number 23</em></span>
and started another script looking at how to do numerology within the shell
scripting environment. You'd think I was a typical programmer or something,
being sidetracked and losing a thread by picking up another one. It reminds me
of those glorious startup days from the late 1990s too, but that's an
entirely different story.
</p><p>
Anyway, numerology can wait another month. This column, I'd like to complete
the command-line calculator because, well, because it's so darn useful and
simultaneously astonishing that there isn't a decent command-line
calculator in Linux after all these years. I mean, really!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18db580.0x19d3768"></a>
When Last We Met</h2></div></div><p>
It was a while back, so let me remind you that the wicked short script to
give you the rudimentary calculator is this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh

bc &lt;&lt; EOF
scale=4
$@
quit
EOF

</pre>
</p><p>
That's it. Name it solve.sh, for example, and you
can test it, as shown here:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh solve.sh 1+3
4
$ sh solve.sh 11/7
1.5714
</pre>
</p><p>
It's easy enough to alias solve to the shell command too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias solve="sh solve.sh"
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, better:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias solve="sh ~/bin/solve.sh"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18db580.0x19d3ad8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As that'll work regardless of where you are in the filesystem
(location-dependent commands are a typical shell gaffe).
</p><p>
What I'd really like, however, is to be able to go into a
&ldquo;solve&rdquo; mode
where anything I type automatically is assumed to be a mathematical
equation, rather than have to type <tt  >solve</tt> each
time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18db580.0x19d3d40"></a>
Rapping about Wrappers</h2></div></div><p>
We've talked about shell script wrappers in the past, so you should recall
this basic structure:

<pre     class="programlisting">
while read userinput
do
  echo "you entered $userinput"
done
</pre>
</p><p>
That's too crude to use as of yet, but we easily can add a prompt so that
it looks like a real program:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo -n "solve"
while read expression
do
  echo "you entered $expression"
  echo -n "solve: "
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Look good? Actually, it's not. There's a subtle error here, one that's
another common scripting mistake. The problem is that there are two echo
commands in Linux: one that's the built-in capability of the shell itself,
and one that's a separate command located in /bin. This is important
because the built-in echo doesn't know what the -n flag does, but the
/bin/echo command does. A tiny tweak, and we're ready to test it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/bin/echo -n "solve: "

while read expression
do
  echo "you entered $expression"
  /bin/echo -n "solve: "
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's see what happens:

<pre     class="programlisting">
solve: 1+1
you entered 1+1
solve: ^D
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18db580.0x19d40b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
That's more like it.
</p><p>
What we really want though, is a script that's smart enough to recognize
whether you've specified parameters on the command line. If you have, it
solves that equation, and if you haven't, it drops you into the interactive
mode. 
</p><p>
That's surprisingly easy to accomplish by testing the $# variable, which
indicates how many arguments are given to the script. Want to see if it's
greater than zero? Do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $# -gt 0 ] ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
One more refinement before I show you the script in its entirety: I want to
have it quit if users type in <tt  >quit</tt> or
<tt  >exit</tt>, rather than force them
to type <tt  >^D</tt> to indicate end of file on standard input (which causes the
read statement to return false and the loop to end).
</p><p>
This is done with a simple string comparison test, which you'll recall is
done with = (the -eq test is for numeric values). So, testing $expression to
see whether it is &ldquo;quit&rdquo; is easy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $expression = "quit" ] ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
To make it a bit more bulletproof, it's actually better here to quote the
variable name, so that if users enter a null string (simply press Return),
the conditional test won't fail with an ugly error message:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ "$expression" = "quit" ] ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
Because I like to make my scripts flexible, I've also added exit as an
alternative to quit, which easily is done with a slightly more
complicated conditional test:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ "$expression" = "quit" -o
     "$expression" = "exit" ] ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
The -o is the logical OR statement in a shell conditional test, but I
have a feeling you've already figured that out.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18db580.0x19d4738"></a>
The Full Script</h2></div></div><p>
Here's where the script stands at this point, in its entirety:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh

if [ $# -gt 0 ] ; then
bc &lt;&lt; EOF
scale=4
$@
quit
EOF
else
  /bin/echo -n "solve: "

  while read expression
  do
    if [ "$expression" = "quit" -o 
         "$expression" = "exit" ] ; then
      exit 0
    fi
bc &lt;&lt; EOF
scale=4
$expression
quit
EOF
    /bin/echo -n "solve: "
  done

  echo ""
  echo "solved."
fi

exit 0

</pre>
</p><p>
Neat and darn useful, I'd say. If I were to continue hacking on it, the
next thing I would do is write a simple help page that I'd store in some
library folder and display on entry of <tt  >?</tt> or
<tt  >help</tt>. It simply
would explain the syntax of the expressions understood by bc (though as
we're invoking bc iteratively, we can't have persistent variables and so
forth,
so unfortunately, this approach won't let us access the full power of the
binary calculator).
</p><p>
To learn what type of sophisticated expressions you can enter, simply type
<tt  >man bc</tt>. Then, let that be your inspiration for further tweaks and mods to
this script!
</p><p>
Next month, I'll go back to the numerology script and see what strange
things we can ascertain about the apparently benign world around us.
Remember, just because I got out of sequence, doesn't mean we're not out to
get you, dear reader!
