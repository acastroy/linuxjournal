With VMware launching an IPO with no peak in sight
and XenSource a red-hot acquisition by Citrix, it's clear that
server virtualization is the flavor of the moment. But,
additional challenges are faced by all hypervisor vendors and users:
performance and connectivity to local data networks and to storage.
The answer? Virtualization 2.0&mdash;infrastructure virtualization.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd71580.0xe69298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Having been indoctrinated in the ways of virtual machines (VMs) by VMware,
where I spent the last four years, I feel like I'm committing heresy when I
say that VMs aren't the sole answer to data-center ills. Beyond that, VMs
actually can create some additional challenges, such as things to trip over
when that moving sidewalk ends.
</p><p>
Don't get me wrong. I like VMware and Xen; I'm learning to believe in
Solaris LDOMs on SPARC, and I'm a huge believer in the power of virtual
machines. I think that for development, it's hard to beat the utility of
having full multi-tier systems, virtually networked together, inside a
single physical machine. And, it's certainly convenient to have packaged
VMs to trade to other folks for easy replication of scenarios.
</p><p>
But, there are additional challenges faced by all hypervisor vendors (and
users), performance and connectivity to local data networks and to
storage.
</p><p>
An immediate aside is probably needed here. No, VMware VI3 doesn't even
touch, much less solve, these issues&mdash;something that the world is beginning
to recognize. Consider the following comments made by some well-known names
in the industry:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&ldquo;Be forewarned&mdash;as soon as companies deploy wider virtualization, a
completely new class of problems will arise. Here the market is still
failing to offer qualified solutions, solutions that largely involve more
sophisticated automation.&rdquo;&mdash;Allessandro Perilli, Virtualization.Info
(world's leading virtualization blog)
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;The ability to do server repurposing is critical for customers who want to
implement a real-time infrastructure.&rdquo;&mdash;Donna Scott, VP and Distinguished
Analyst, Gartner Group
</p></li><li><p>
&ldquo;Servers virtualized? Great! Now you need to virtualize your entire
data center. Virtualization isn't happening only within servers.
Infrastructure virtualization applies a software abstraction layer across
the entire data center.&rdquo;&mdash;Rachel Chalmers, The451Group
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In short, it's not enough to have virtualized servers. You need virtual
connectivity and real servers too&mdash;aka infrastructure virtualization.
</p><p>
But, let's consider the two challenges again, performance and connectivity
to local data networks and storage.
The performance challenge is straightforward, and therefore, it's not worth much
discussion.
</p><p>
Hypervisors take up CPU cycles, are a potential point of failure (if the
hypervisor fails, the whole set of VMs are lost), and due to the
round-robin nature of their scheduling, they actually can mask race conditions
in tests. Honest hypervisor vendors always will admit this point quite
openly&mdash;in fact, I'm proud that during my tenure, VMware quite openly
stated &ldquo;don't virtualize applications above a certain threshold CPU,
network or disk I/O level&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The point? To test and run many multi-tier production applications, such as
Citrix, SQL Server, SAP and so on, you want to run on bare metal. This,
unfortunately, raises the challenge of movement between physical and virtual
(P2V &amp; V2P), as well as raising the second challenge, networking.
</p><p>
Networking is a more subtle challenge, because it's out of box&mdash;outside
the physical machine in which a hypervisor (okay, let's be honest, it's an
operating system) lives.
</p><p>
Again, it's time for an aside: hypervisors are an operating system. A
hypervisor, like VMware ESX Server or Citrix XenSource Enterprise Server,
is installed on a bare-metal server-class computer. The computer is cabled
in to a LAN (data) network switch and a SAN (storage) switch. The computer
is turned on, boots up with the hypervisor and then can run multiple full
servers, in virtual machines, each with its own operating system and
applications (for example, Windows/Exchange e-mail server and a Linux/Apache Web server) concurrently on top of that hypervisor operating system.
</p><p>
Hypervisors, therefore, control events happening in-box, within a computer.
The moment data leaves the physical machine, bound out to another physical
box via NIC to LAN or to storage via HBA to SAN (or NIC to NAS), it has
left the hypervisor's control.
</p><p>
What does this mean or matter? Well, envision your nice multi-tier
application&mdash;Web servers, app servers, databases&mdash;built in VMs and
&ldquo;cabled&rdquo; inside single physical machine A.
Works great.
</p><p>
Now, take one of those VMs, and put it on a different physical machine
B
(running a hypervisor) that's somewhere else.
</p><p>
Unless that physical machine is on the same LAN subnet, with the same SAN
access, you've just broken your data center. The server (VM) you just moved
is reaching out to LAN and SAN paths that don't physically exist anymore,
because machine B doesn't have them.
</p><p>
Not to mention that little part about machine B already having to be
running a hypervisor. (And, if you can't get to machine B to turn it on
and install that hypervisor, such as in a DR case, then what? Don't say,
&ldquo;oh
gosh, that will all be fixed by virtual HBAs and NPIV&rdquo;, either. NPIV
requires a full data-center rollout, supported across all hardware&mdash;got
legacy switches, anyone?)
</p><p>
Virtual HBAs make a bad problem worse. Now you have even more bound HBAs.
(Heaven forfend that you're allowed to change virtual HBAs like virtual
MACs, that'd create an even worse problem, as without locking, people would
duplicate HBAs and kill off entire SANs by accident.)
</p><p>
But, what's the solution? Ideally, you'd be able to do a few things:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Move easily between physical and virtual. Enable four-minute P2V/V2P
conversions to increase hypervisor proliferation and adoption. Seamlessly
move servers from running on physical machines to running on virtual
machines&mdash;and back. This functionality provides a safety net for
applications not suited for hypervisors, allows unlike hardware to be used
for disaster recovery and high availability, and removes potential
application vendor-support issues for hypervisors by providing a vehicle to
test applications quickly on bare-metal hardware.
</p></li><li><p>
Move what was running on your physical machines around as easily as what
was running on your virtual machines. So, you could remote-start machine B,
above. (For bonus points, remote-start hypervisors like ESX Server or Xen
too.) This then provides high availability on a per-physical-machine level.
Note that the VMware VirtualCenter HA option (and the Xen equivalent) depends
on the availability of another physical machine running ESX server with the
right physical network and storage connectivity. Scalent creates such a
machine in real time.
</p></li><li><p>
Take the network topology, LAN and SAN, with you. So, no more SAN
configuration adjustments or opening all SAN LUNs to all machines (good
grief). Ideally, you'd be able to install hypervisors that could
communicate within your existing multi-tier networks and have real-time
access to storage to enable features like VMotion. (Again, VMware ESX
requires that physical machines share common pools of storage and the same
network subnet if they are to share virtual machines in a VMware ESX farm
or cluster.) This can present logistical or security concerns when
applied to current data-center architectures. A good solution would allow
VMware ESX physical machines to be in physically disparate locations&mdash;behind layers of LAN switches, in different racks or data centers,
connected to storage LUNs as needed&mdash;thus allowing a simple ESX farm or
cluster creation in existing data-center architectures.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This solution would manifest as infrastructure virtualization (IV)
software&mdash;effectively, a data-center topology manager. IV software turns on physical
computers, sets up the networks between them, sets up their connections to
storage and points them at the right software (operating system/application
package) to run.
</p><p>
For example, extending the above hypervisor example, at any time, IV
software could turn on any three physical computers, with no software
running on them and set computer one to network A/storage LUN 1, running the
Windows/Exchange e-mail server package; set computer two to network B/storage LUN 2, running the Linux/Apache Web server; and set computer
three to network C/storage LUNs 3 and 4, running a hypervisor, with the
hypervisor load of virtual machines.
</p><p>
How would this look in real life? Let's consider a disaster recovery
scenario.
</p><p>
Visualize a data center. There are many physical computers running various
operating systems (Windows, Linux, Solaris, AIX, VMware ESX, Xen and so on) on
various hardware (x86, SPARC, PowerPC), connected to various data networks
and various storage LUNs.
</p><p>
Suddenly, a rack of computers in the corner goes up in flames.
</p><p>
Luckily, the customers are running IV
software, as well as their existing automation, virtualization and
bare-metal operating systems. That infrastructure virtualization or server
repurposing software immediately realizes that the physical computers are down,
hunts around the data center and finds some computers that are off or
some that are running low-priority jobs, like print servers, that the IT
staff has designated &ldquo;repurposable&rdquo;.
</p><p>
The IV software turns on or reboots those physical machines, assigns them
the networks and storage connections of the burned machines and tells the
computers to load the software to which the IV points them.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, there are only ten new working computers&mdash;20 went
up in smoke. So, the IV software loads two of the new computers with a
hypervisor and runs six of the burned systems as virtual machines on top
of the physical computers running the hypervisor. This is possible because the IV
software set up all the necessary network and storage connectivity for all
those servers and associated them with the physical machine running the
hypervisor in real time.
</p><p>
Pipe dream, you say? Not at all. The scenario just described is alive and
well, running on Linux and controlling multiple other operating systems, in
some of the world's largest data centers today. And, disaster recovery is
only one of the benefits; others include performance, real-world test
harness automation and eased hypervisor deployment.
</p><p>
So, enjoy server virtualization. Go deploy hypervisors; they're a good
thing. But, don't be caught unaware when the sidewalk ends. There's more to
virtualization than servers. Your infrastructure is waiting.
