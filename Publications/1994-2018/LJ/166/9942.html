When it's time to convert a physical machine to a virtual one, use these
steps to make the move safely and with a small maintenance window.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd372f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You don't have to look far in tech news to see that virtualization
has become a big deal. After all, computers continue to become faster and
more powerful, and as they do, the services that run on them often use
fewer overall resources. On top of that, modern servers often need a
fraction of their predecessors' power and cooling. With virtualization,
you can get power savings and more efficient use of server resources,
and you can create servers quickly without waiting on parts to arrive.
</p><p>
Although some people start from a clean slate and create brand-new virtual
servers from scratch to replace old physical machines, you simply may not
have the extra time to invest to make the clean break to new versions
of Linux with all-new packages. In many cases, it makes more sense to
create a virtual clone of a physical server and keep all the files
and services identical. If you want to go this route, there are a number
of different methods you can use if you can handle unlimited downtime,
but if you want to keep downtime and overall disruption to a minimum (and
who doesn't?), there is a fairly simple process I've used to migrate
a large number of servers to virtual machines with around 30 minutes
of average downtime&mdash;well within most acceptable maintenance windows.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd37500"></a>
Caveats and Limitations</h2></div></div><p>
Before I get into the actual steps, there are some limitations to this
approach that I should mention. First, this method has been designed and tested to work with
VMware virtualization, specifically with its enterprise server products
(although it would also work fine with their free server product). VMware
works well for this process because it doesn't require that I modify
my current Linux kernel to virtualize it&mdash;something that isn't always
possible when you want to virtualize an old server. Having 
said that, these steps also could work with other virtual machine technologies
that can use an unmodified Linux kernel. Second, this procedure has been
tested with and is aimed at Red Hat-like distributions (Red Hat, CentOS and
so on), but with a few tweaks I discuss later, it also could work with
other distribution flavors. Finally, the actual amount of downtime you will
need for this process probably will vary from my results, especially as
you first test out each of the steps. Servers with large or slow disks
and, specifically, servers that change large amounts of data frequently
possibly will take longer to sync.
</p><p>
Along with these disclaimers, it's only fair to point out some of the
benefits to this method:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
You can do a majority of the migration work against a live server.
</p></li><li><p>
Standard Linux tools are used for the synchronization and other changes.
</p></li><li><p>
The process protects your network from both servers showing up at the same
time.
</p></li><li><p>
You safely can leave the old server on the network and access its files
while users use the new virtual machine.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now that the disclaimers are out of the way, let me summarize the
process in a few general steps. First, create a fresh virtual machine
to replace the physical host. Then, boot in to the virtual machine with a
rescue CD and partition the disk. Next, perform the main synchronization
of files from the live physical server to the new virtual machine. Take
down your physical machine and reboot in to a rescue CD, and perform a
final synchronization from the off-line server. After that, change the boot
settings on the virtual machine to suit its new environment, and then
reboot in to your new virtual machine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd37a28"></a>
Create the Virtual Machine</h2></div></div><p>
To get started, first you must create a virtual machine container to
replace your physical machine. Specific steps are different if you
use VMware Server versus Virtual Infrastructure 3, but ultimately, what
you want to do is to create a machine that mostly matches your physical
machine's specifications. The specifications don't have to match
exactly, and there actually are good reasons why you might want to tweak
the settings a bit. For instance, if your server has 2GB of RAM, but you
notice that it really needs only 1GB, now would be a good opportunity to
change it. If your server is starting to run out of storage, this is a
good time to increase it. If your physical server has a 32-bit or 64-bit
processor, however, make sure the virtual machine matches. Also, be
sure that you match the operating system version you report to VMware
with your actual OS if possible. For instance, if your server runs
RHEL 3, don't tell VMware that it runs RHEL 4. You want to ensure that
the OS will have drivers for the virtual devices that VMware presents,
specifically for the disk subsystem. For instance, I've had numerous
headaches due to RHEL 4's removal of the BusLogic SCSI module from the
base OS (a virtual SCSI device that is a commonly used by VMware along
with an LSI Logic virtual SCSI device).
</p><p>
After you set the specs for the virtual machine, edit the CD-ROM device
so that it points either to an actual rescue CD in the VMware server
or to an ISO. I prefer Knoppix for this procedure, but any live CD should
work as long as it has the rsync and chroot tools, an SSH server and
enough module support to access the disks on both the physical machine
and the virtual machine. Now, boot the virtual machine into the rescue
CD. Everything you need to do is done via the command line, so under
Knoppix, type <tt  >knoppix 2</tt> at the boot: prompt to bypass the GUI
and go straight to a command line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd37be0"></a>
Partition the Virtual Machine's Disk</h2></div></div><p>
After Knoppix boots, you need to partition, format and mount the new
partitions for this virtual machine. Use fdisk or cfdisk from the command
line to create your partitions to match your physical server. Again,
you don't have to match the partition sizes exactly, as long as there is
plenty of room to store all the files from the physical server. For
this example, I will have a physical server with a single SCSI drive
(/dev/sda) with three partitions: /dev/sda1 for root, /dev/sda2 for swap
and /dev/sda3 for /home. After you create the same partitions on the
virtual machine, format them with the same filesystems you use on the
physical machine, create mountpoints for them and then mount them:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sda1
$ sudo mkfs -t ext3 /dev/sda3
$ sudo mkswap /dev/sda2
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sda1 /mnt/sda3
$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1
$ sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd37d40"></a>
First Sync</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have created and mounted the partitions, you are ready for
the first synchronization. For this to work, your virtual machine must
have network access, and specifically, it needs to be able to access SSH
on the physical machine. By default, Knoppix will attempt to get a DHCP
lease if available, but otherwise, if your rescue disc is not able to get
on the network, you need to make the necessary changes so that it
can. This virtualization procedure reduces downtime by synchronizing the
files twice&mdash;once while the physical server is running and once after it
is off-line. The idea here is that a majority of files on most servers
stay the same, at least over one or two days. If you perform the
bulk of the file synchronization while the server is on-line, when
you take it off-line, the final synchronization can occur much faster.
</p><p>
I use rsync for the synchronization, and for it to work, you need
to allow (at least temporarily) for root SSH logins to occur on the
physical machine. If it is disabled, edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and change <tt  >PermitRootLogin no</tt> to
<tt  >PermitRootLogin yes</tt>, and restart
sshd. Otherwise, it will be difficult for rsync to copy all the files
on the system. You will run an rsync command for each partition on the
physical server, so in this example, that makes two rsync commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo rsync -avx --numeric-ids 
 &#8618;--progress physicalhost:/ /mnt/sda1/
$ sudo rsync -avx --numeric-ids 
 &#8618;--progress physicalhost:/home/ /mnt/sda3/
</pre>
</p><p>
The rsync options I use here are chosen very deliberately, so it's worth
understanding what each of them does. The -a option sets &ldquo;archive
mode&rdquo;,
which essentially turns on a number of rsync options that preserve file
ownership and permissions and other settings. The -v option makes rsync
provide more output about what it is doing, and the --progress argument
displays a progress meter so you can keep up with how long rsync
will take. The other two arguments are rather important, and if you don't
use rsync regularly, you might not come across them much. The -x argument
tells rsync to stick to one filesystem. This is important particularly
when you back up the / partition; otherwise, rsync happily will traverse
into /home or any other partitions you have and copy them all into your
local /mnt/sda1 mountpoint, which probably will not have enough space
to hold everything. The --numeric-ids argument sets file permissions
on the destination files based on their numeric ID and not the matching
user or group name. This is important as the Knoppix CD very likely has
different user and group ID mappings than your server.
</p><p>
After these rsync commands complete, you are ready to take your physical
server off-line. If you did need to schedule a maintenance window for
the physical server, just leave the virtual machine running in its
current state, and proceed to the next step when you are ready to take
the physical machine off-line. If a number of days will pass until your
maintenance window, you might want to run the above rsync commands again
once you are close to the maintenance window, just so the final off-line rsync will
happen more quickly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd380b0"></a>
Second and Final Sync</h2></div></div><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>On the Physical Server:</b></span>
</p><p>
The last synchronization happens when the physical server is
completely off-line, so you can make sure that no other files change
on you. To do this, simply take a Knoppix CD (or your preferred rescue
CD) to the physical machine and boot from it. All the commands you
run will be from the command line, so you can boot in to Knoppix's
terminal-only mode here as well. As Knoppix boots, it should 
detect your partitions automatically and create mountpoints under /mnt for
them, but if
it doesn't, just use the mkdir command to create them manually. Knoppix
will not mount partitions automatically at boot, so you need to do
that manually. In the case of this example, my physical server has two
partitions to mount:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1
$ sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I need to set a password for the root Knoppix user and then start
the SSH server on this machine so I can run the rsync:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo passwd
$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh start
</pre>
</p><p>
Keep in mind that because I booted this machine into Knoppix, it most
likely has gotten a different IP address via DHCP. Type
<tt  >/sbin/ifconfig</tt> to
check which IP address the machine currently has, as you will need it for the
final rsync.
</p><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>
On the Virtual Server:</b></span>
</p><p>
You now can start the final synchronization from the virtual server. The
commands are very similar to what you used before, except this time, I add
the --delete option so that rsync will remove any files on the virtual
machine that were deleted from the physical machine since the last time I
synced. Also notice that because the physical server is now booted in to
Knoppix, I have to change the directory paths and the IP address for
the remote host, as they changed since I booted in to Knoppix:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo rsync -avx --numeric-ids --progress 
 &#8618;--delete 192.168.1.150:/mnt/sda1/ /mnt/sda1/
$ sudo rsync -avx --numeric-ids --progress 
 &#8618;--delete 192.168.1.150:/mnt/sda3/ /mnt/sda3/
</pre>
</p><p>
These commands could take a long time or a short time, depending on
how many files have changed since the last time you ran rsync. Once it
completes, you are ready to perform the final finishing touches on your
virtual machine before bringing it into service.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd38688"></a>
Tweak Boot Settings</h2></div></div><p>
Even though the files on the virtual machine are identical to the physical
machine, the virtual machine will not boot correctly at this point until
you make some changes to the boot settings. This works best from within
a chroot environment, so type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sudo chroot /mnt/sda1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd387e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
before you run the rest of the commands. Be sure to replace
/mnt/sda1 with the mountpoint for your root partition if it is different.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd388f0"></a>
GRUB or LILO Changes</h2></div></div><p>
The first change you need to make within the chroot environment is
to restore your bootloader. If you use GRUB, look at /boot/grub/menu.lst
or /boot/grub/grub.conf. If you use LILO, look at /etc/lilo.conf. Check
for any devices that may have changed. In particular, if you switched
from an IDE to a SCSI device, from a RAID to a non-RAID or changed
the root partition order, be sure to make changes here to
reflect that. Next, if you use GRUB, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# grub-install /dev/sda
</pre>
</p><p>
Change /dev/sda to match the primary disk device from which you will boot. If
you use LILO, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /sbin/lilo
</pre>
</p><p>
After your bootloader has been installed, check /etc/fstab and confirm
that any drive, partition or device changes you made in your bootloader
config file also were changed here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc3f580.0xd38b58"></a>
Re-create the initrd</h2></div></div><p>
Many servers these days use an initrd file to load modules that are
essential for the boot process but that don't necessarily fit in the
kernel image. Often, this initrd file contains only the modules that
suit your hardware, so when you make the switch to new hardware, such as
is the case with VMware's virtual SCSI controllers, you need to create
a fresh initrd that has these new modules in it.
</p><p>
On a Red Hat system, edit either /etc/modules.conf or /etc/modprobe.conf
for RHEL 4, and remove any references to scsi_hostadapter you find
there. If you configured your virtual machine to use VMware's virtual
BusLogic SCSI controller, replace those references with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias scsi_hostadapter BusLogic
</pre>
</p><p>
If you chose VMware's LSI Logic SCSI controller, add the following lines
instead:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias scsi_hostadapter mptbase
alias scsi_hostadapter1 mptscsih
</pre>
</p><p>
Obviously, these modules are specific to VMware virtualization, so if
you want to attempt this with another virtualization technology, you
will need to look up which SCSI modules it uses and make sure they are
referenced here.
</p><p>
Now, you are ready to create a new initrd. Find the location of the initrd
your server last used from your /boot/grub/menu.lst, /boot/grub/grub.conf
or /etc/lilo.conf file, and then move it out of the way so you can 
create a new one safely. Then, run mkinitrd with the path to the initrd file to
create and the name of the current kernel. For my example server, I am
using the Red Hat 2.4.21-32.0.1.ELsmp kernel, so I would type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mv /boot/initrd-2.4.21-32.0.1.ELsmp.img 
 &#8618;/boot/initrd-2.4.21-32.0.1.ELsmp.img.bak
# mkinitrd /boot/initrd-2.4.21-32-0.1.ELsmp 
 &#8618;2.4.21-32-0.1.ELsmp
</pre>
</p><p>
As I said before, this is the method Red Hat uses to create initrd
files. Unfortunately, different distributions use different methods. For
instance, Debian's mkinitrd stores configuration files under /etc/mkinitrd,
and the mkinitrd command uses slightly different options, so you might
need to do some extra research to create a new initrd for your server's
distribution.
</p><p>
At this point, you can reboot the virtual machine. Confirm that your
physical machine no longer has its original IP address, or otherwise, simply
power it off to be safe. If your server runs a hardware configuration
service like kudzu, it most likely will prompt you at boot time because it
has detected changes in the server's hardware. Be sure to select Keep
Configuration for any old SCSI or network hardware it mentions, and
select Ignore for any new SCSI or network hardware; however, you safely
can remove old video, sound, USB and similar hardware if you are prompted.
</p><p>
Once the machine has booted completely, confirm that all system
services have started and that you are connected to the network. I
have noticed on some Red Hat systems that the network card's MAC
address has been hard-coded into the configuration file, and as
that has changed on the new virtual hardware, the network won't
resume. In this case, simply edit the configuration file for your network card under
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ (often ifcfg-eth0), and either remove
the reference to the MAC address or change it to reflect the new MAC
address. Then, restart the networking service.
</p><p>
Practice this procedure on a few test machines to be sure you have all
the steps down for your particular network before attempting it on a
live production machine. Nothing is worse than scrambling to fix strange
initrd issues on a virtual machine while the physical server is down and
your maintenance window is ticking away. You will find that the
more often you
perform these migrations, the faster you can do them&mdash;you even might be
able to stagger them and complete a few at the same time.
