Running Linux inside Windows using QEMU.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc30580.0xd28240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I recently bought an IBM ThinkPad laptop with 1GB of RAM and Windows XP
preinstalled. Because I have been using only Linux for many years,
I immediately thought about making it a dual-boot system (actually a
multiboot system, because I usually install several copies of Linux
on my computer). 
</p><p>
As I said, I mainly use only Linux, but I also keep a copy of
Windows around, because other people may need to use my
computer who are not able to use Linux. Also, being a computer
specialist, I like knowing all the ways of using a computer, not only
the best one, and as many people still use
Windows, I want to understand their
points of view.
</p><p>
So, I now can reboot and switch from Linux to Windows and
from Windows to Linux. However, I thought it would be
useful to run both systems in parallel, instead of switching
from one to the other. One of the reasons for this is the Windows XP Home
Edition that was installed on my laptop is customized by IBM
specifically for this laptop, and there are some tools developed by
IBM that make things more convenient. Another reason is that I
wanted to test a client-server network with Windows as the client
and Linux as the server. I'm sure you can think of other reasons for doing
this as well.
</p><p>
After some research and testing, I decided to use QEMU. Now I
can run any of the Linux distributions that are installed on the
other partitions on Windows. I also can access Windows from the Linux
system. I can access the Internet from the Linux system, and I can access any
of the Linux services from Windows. Additionally, I can access certain Linux
services from the network. It's like having two systems running
on the same machine at the same time.
</p><p>
Running Linux inside Windows using QEMU is not difficult; however,
doing it well requires some tricks that I didn't discover
immediately. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc30580.0xd28558"></a>
Installing and Running QEMU</h2></div></div><p>
Installing QEMU in Windows is easy. I downloaded
qemu-0.9.0-windows.zip and extracted it in D:\QEMU. I didn't forget to
read README-en.txt (always read READMEs). Then, I made a copy of the
batch file (script) qemu-win.bat and renamed it 
start-linux.bat. To access it more easily, I
created a shortcut (link) for it on the desktop by doing a right-click and
selecting Send to&rarr;Desktop. Then, I modified the last line of start-linux.bat to look like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
qemu.exe -L . -m 128 -hda \\.\PhysicalDrive0 -soundhw all -localtime
</pre>
</p><p>
The modification consists of replacing the parameter <tt  >-hda
linux.img</tt>
with the parameter <tt  >-hda \\.\PhysicalDrive0</tt>. Now, when I start QEMU by
running this script, instead of using the file linux.img as a
virtual hard disk, it uses my real hard disk and boots from it. Then,
I see the beautiful GRUB menu that is installed in the MBR of my hard
disk, and I select and boot one of my Linux systems. Isn't
it great?
</p><p>
Be careful not to boot Windows again inside Windows. According to the
documentation, using the same disk image in more than one
machine can corrupt it. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc30580.0xd28870"></a>
Running Linux</h2></div></div><p>
The system that I usually boot inside Windows is Fedora Core 6. The
parameter -m 128 tells QEMU to use up to 128MB of RAM for the
emulated system. With 128MB of RAM, Fedora isn't able to run in 
graphic mode and falls back to text mode. However, with 256MB of
RAM, it works. If you have 1GB of RAM in your machine, like me, you could
be generous and give 512MB to Linux.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9628f1.large.jpg"><img src="9628f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Fedora Core 6 Running inside Windows XP through QEMU
</p></div></div><p>
The graphical interface is important to me, but I am
quite happy with command-line Linux. In order to run Fedora in text
mode, even though it has 256MB of RAM, I pass the 3 parameter to the
kernel, which tells it to boot in run-level 3. Initially, I did this
manually, with these steps:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Select Fedora in the GRUB menu.
</p></li><li><p>
Press E to edit it.
</p></li><li><p>
Select the kernel line.
</p></li><li><p>
Press E to edit it.
</p></li><li><p>
Append 3 at the end of the kernel line, and press Enter to return.
</p></li><li><p>
Press B to boot the modified Fedora entry.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Later, I added another entry to the menu, with the 3 parameter 
appended to the kernel line in order to boot it more quickly, which looks
like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
title Fedora Core TextMode (2.6.18-1.2798.fc6)
     root (hd0,7)
     kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-1.2798.fc6 ro root=/dev/hda8 rhgb quiet 3
     initrd /boot/initrd-2.6.18-1.2798.fc6.img
</pre>
</p><p>
Sometimes I see several error messages and failures while
Linux is booting (for example, when I tried Scientific Linux), but I
ignore them. The reason for this is the hardware of the emulated
machine (which is being emulated by QEMU) is somewhat different from
the hardware of the real machine. The same thing happens
when the hard disk is taken from one machine and placed in
another. Linux autodetects the machine's devices and reports
that some devices are missing and new devices are added (for
example, network cards). I simply keep the configurations of the
&ldquo;removed&rdquo; devices and let Linux autoconfigure the new devices it
finds.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc30580.0xd291b8"></a>
Making QEMU Run Faster</h2></div></div><p>
To make the emulated system run faster, I installed
kqemu. I downloaded kqemu-1.3.0pre11.tar.gz from the QEMU download
page and extracted it inside D:\QEMU\. Then, I clicked kqemu.inf
with the right-mouse button and selected Install. Next, I added, in
start-linux.bat, the command <tt  >net start kqemu</tt> and added the
parameter <tt  >-kernel-kqemu</tt> to qemu.exe. Now, the last two lines of
start-linux.bat look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
net start kqemu
qemu.exe -L . -m 256 -kernel-kqemu -hda \\.\PhysicalDrive0 
 &#8618;-soundhw all -localtime
</pre>
</p><p>
Note: Scientific Linux 4.4 does not work at all with the parameter
-kernel-kqemu, and the problem seems to be an incompatibility of the
kernel with the BIOS file (which is named bios.bin, and I think that
represents the BIOS configuration of the emulated system). When I
replaced it with the BIOS of Puppy Linux, it worked. It is strange that the
original BIOS is 128KB and Puppy's BIOS is 64KB, which is
older as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc30580.0xd29420"></a>
Accessing Windows and the Internet from Linux</h2></div></div><p>
The default QEMU parameters for the network are <tt  >-net nic -net
user</tt>.
This means that it will emulate a virtual interface on the Windows
side and create a network interface eth0 for the emulated Linux
system. Both of these interfaces have a virtual connection between
them, allowing them to communicate with each other. The IP of the
Windows virtual interface is 10.0.2.2/24, and QEMU also creates a
virtual DHCP server connected to it. To get an IP for Linux from the
QEMU DHCPD, I log in as root and give the command
<tt  >dhclient</tt>. Then, the
Linux interface gets IP 10.0.2.15/24, gateway 10.0.2.2 and DNS
10.0.2.3. Afterward, Windows and the Internet can be accessed from Linux
without a problem.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9628f2.large.jpg"><img src="9628f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Network Diagram
</p></div></div><p>
To check the network configuration, try the commands
<tt  >ip address ls</tt>, <tt  >ip route ls</tt>
and <tt  >cat /etc/resolv.conf</tt> in Linux. Here's example
output from those commands:


<pre     class="programlisting">

[root@fedora6 ~]# ip address ls
1: lo: &lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

    inet 10.0.2.15/24 brd 10.0.2.255 scope global eth0
3: sit0: &lt;NOARP&gt; mtu 1480 qdisc noop
    link/sit 0.0.0.0 brd 0.0.0.0

[root@fedora6 ~]# ip route ls

[root@fedora6 ~]# cat /etc/resolv.conf
; generated by /sbin/dhclient-script
nameserver 10.0.2.3

</pre>
</p><p>
To test the network connection, try the commands <tt  >ping
10.0.2.2</tt> and
<tt  >wget http://www.google.com/</tt>.
</p><p>
If you try to ping www.google.com (or any other IP), it
won't work. However, the network connection is okay and working, and
you can verify it with other tools, such as wget or lftp. It simply
means that ping is not working for some reason. This has been very
misleading to me, because the usual way to check for network
connectivity is to ping something out there.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc30580.0xd29b00"></a>
Accessing Windows Files from Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Because I can ping Windows from Linux as 10.0.2.2, I also can access any
service (d&aelig;mon) that runs on Windows. In particular, I can access any
file-sharing services. Usually, I run Apache as a Web server on
Windows. It can be installed easily with EasyPHP. Then, I use wget to
retrieve any files that are accessible through the Web server.
</p><p>
Another service I use is FTP. I install and configure it using
the FileZilla FTP server. From Linux, I can access the folders
(directories) that are shared by the FTP service, using lftp (you can
use any other ftp client as well). This is better than using a Web
server, because I can transfer files both ways&mdash;from Windows to Linux
and from Linux to Windows.
</p><p>
I've even used svnserve to run a Subversion
service in Windows. From Linux, I could access the
Subversion repositories in Windows. Think of it as a way to
transfer files between Windows and Linux, as you can access
the svn repositories from both Windows and Linux, although it is not
a very straightforward way to transfer files.
</p><p>
I tried transferring files between Linux
and Windows using a fat32 partition, which can be accessed from
both systems. Theoretically, there is no reason why it should not work,
and actually it does work; however, it does not work so well. The
problem is that the modifications that are done to fat32 from Linux
are not &ldquo;seen&rdquo; from Windows until it is restarted, and the
modifications that are done from Windows are not &ldquo;seen&rdquo; from Linux
until QEMU is restarted, which makes this solution impractical and
unusable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc30580.0x1122068"></a>
Accessing Linux's httpd and sshd</h2></div></div><p>
In order to access the Web server and Linux's secure shell,
I added these parameters to the qemu.exe command: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
-redir tcp:88:10.0.2.15:80 -redir tcp:22::22
</pre>
</p><p>
The first -redir parameter makes QEMU answer any requests
to port 88. Actually, it is not going to answer it itself but 
redirects it to server 10.0.2.15, port 80, which is
the Linux Web server. I chose port 88 (different from 80) in
case I need to run any other Web service (such as EasyPHP) in
Windows, so they don't have conflicts with each other. To test
that it's working, open http://127.0.0.1:88/ in a browser.
Make sure that the Linux network interface has been
configured (with dhclient) after the Linux server has been started.
</p><p>
The second -redir parameter makes QEMU redirect any
connections to port 22 (secure shell) to Linux's port 22. If the
server IP is missing, the default value is 10.0.2.15, which
corresponds to the IP given by the emulated DHCPD to the emulated
system (Linux). To access the shell of a Linux server from Windows, I
use PuTTY by connecting 
to 127.0.0.1 port 22. Accessing the Linux shell through PuTTY is
much more convenient than accessing it through the QEMU console,
because I can open several terminals at the same time, and I can copy/paste 
between Linux and Windows. I also can
enlarge PuTTY terminals and adjust fonts and colors. It also is possible to use pscp to copy files between Windows
and Linux through SSH.
</p><p>
If you want to make these Linux services (httpd and sshd) accessible
to the network as well (so they can be accessed from other
computers on the local network), open the Windows firewall
for them: Control Panel&rarr;Windows Firewall&rarr;Exceptions&rarr;Add
Program. Then browse, select D:\QEMU\qemu.exe, and press
OK. Next, open Control Panel&rarr;Windows Firewall&rarr;Exceptions&rarr;Add
Port, and add ports 88 and 22. Also check the box
Change scope... when you add or edit a program or port.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9628f3.large.jpg"><img src="9628f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

More Complex Networking between Windows and Linux</h2></div></div><p>
I also want to access other Linux services, such as Samba and FTP.
Adding another -redir parameter for each port that I want to
access is not convenient, and it's not an elegant solution
anyway. I want to be able to access Linux from Windows without any
restrictions. It does not seem to be so easy, because all that Windows
can see is the qemu.exe process, and it has no idea what goes on
inside it. So, how can Windows communicate directly with the Linux
that runs inside QEMU? It is possible by creating a tap virtual Ethernet
adapter using OpenVPN.
</p><p>
I downloaded openvpn-2.0.9-install.exe and installed it. During the
installation, I checked only the components TAP-Win32 Virtual
Ethernet Adapter, Add OpenVPN to Path and Add Shortcuts to Start
Menu, because I didn't need the others. I changed the destination
folder to D:\QEMU\OpenVPN, because I prefer to group the related
tools together. I received some warnings that this software has
not passed Windows testing, but I continued anyway, trusting that open-source 
testing is stronger than Windows testing.
</p><p>
After installation, I selected the menu Start&rarr;OpenVPN&rarr;Add a new
TAP-Win32 virtual Ethernet adapter to create a new tap
interface. Again, I received the same warnings, 
but continued anyway. Now, in Network
Connections, I find a new network connection named Local Area
Connection 1. I right-click on it and rename it tap1.
</p><p>
Then, I modified start-linux.bat by adding these parameters to QEMU: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
-net nic,vlan=0 
-net tap,vlan=0,ifname=tap1
-net nic,vlan=1
-net user,vlan=1
</pre>
</p><p>
The parameter -net nic tells QEMU to create a new network interface
for the emulated system. Because this parameter has been used twice,
Linux is going to run in a machine that has two network
interfaces, eth0 and eth1. The parameter -net user creates a virtual
interface on the other side (the Windows side). It is the network
interface that was created previously by default (the one that has a
built-in DHCP server associated with it), even though we
didn't specify any -net parameters. The parameter -net tap tells QEMU to use
the virtual Ethernet adapter tap1, which we created previously, and
to connect it to the virtual network. The vlan options that are used
with the -net parameters tell QEMU how to connect these virtual
interfaces to each other. All the interfaces that have the same vlan
number are connected to the same virtual hub/switch. So, we 
have two switches in our virtual network that is emulated by QEMU.
</p><p>
The last two lines of linux-start.bat now look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
net start kqemu
qemu.exe -L . -m 256 -kernel-kqemu -hda \\.\PhysicalDrive0 
 &#8618;-localtime -redir tcp:88:10.0.2.15:80 -redir tcp:22::22 
 &#8618;-net nic,vlan=0 -net tap,vlan=0,ifname=tap1 
 &#8618;-net nic,vlan=1 -net user,vlan=1
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the QEMU parameter <tt  >-soundhw all</tt>
is now missing. I removed it because one of the
sound devices was creating conflicts with the network devices, so
they were not recognized properly as eth0 and eth1. If you can't do
without a sound device, at least append it at the very end of the line;
the parameters' order does matter.
</p><p>
The order of the -net parameter declarations matters as well.
I have noticed that if -net user is declared before -net tap, 
eth0 and eth1 are switched with each other, and there is also a failure
to initialize eth0 during the Fedora initialization scripts. 
Keep this in mind, in case you have any similar problems. 
</p><p>
After starting QEMU, we have a (virtual) physical network (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9628f4.large.jpg"><img src="9628f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Physical Network
</p></div></div><p>
To check the &ldquo;physical&rdquo; connections of the network, press
Ctrl-Alt-2 to switch to the QEMU monitor. Then, in the (qemu) prompt,
give the command <tt  >info network</tt>. Finally, press Ctrl-Alt-1 to get
back to the Linux console. Here's the output from the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
VLAN 0 devices:
  tap: ifname=tap1
  ne2000 pci macaddr=52:54:00:12:34:56
VLAN 1 devices:
  user redirector
  ne2000 pci macaddr=52:54:00:12:34:57
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, we need just to configure the network settings properly, such as
IPs, gateway and DNS.
</p><p>
The user redirector interface on the Windows side is configured
automatically by QEMU, with IP 10.0.2.2/24, and we don't have access
to it, so we cannot modify it. If you check in Network Connections,
you will find that the virtual interface tap1 now appears to be
connected. To configure it, right-click on it and select
Properties, then select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and
Properties again. In the configuration window, set a fixed-IP
address of 192.168.10.10 and netmask 255.255.255.0. It's just like 
a usual network interface configuration.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9628f5.large.jpg"><img src="9628f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Configuration of the Network Interface tap1
</p></div></div><p>
To check that the network configuration is okay, run
<tt  >ipconfig</tt> at the
command prompt, and you'll see this output for tap1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Ethernet adapter tap1:

        Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . : 
        IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.10.2
        Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
        Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 
</pre>
</p><p>
This output is displayed when QEMU is running; otherwise, the
information for tap1 will be something like: <tt  >Media
disconnected</tt>.
</p><p>
Now, we're done with network configuration on the Windows side. This has
to be done only once. All that is left is configuring the
network interfaces on the Linux side.
</p><p>
First, log in as root. To check that you already have two network
interfaces, run <tt  >ip addr</tt>, and it should list eth0 and
eth1. You can
configure eth0 automatically, like this: <tt  >dhclient
eth0</tt>, as we did
previously, and it will get an IP from QEMU's built-in DHCP server. Then,
you can continue with eth1's manual configuration.
</p><p>
However, I prefer to use scripts whenever possible, and I
want to make sure that eth0 always gets the IP 10.0.2.15/24, no matter
what, because this is important for the -redir parameters shown
previously. So, I do the network configuration on the Linux side
by running this script (which has to be rerun whenever the system is
rebooted):


<pre     class="programlisting">
bash# cat /usr/local/config/net-config-qemu.sh
#!/bin/bash
### configure the network when Linux is being
### emulated from Windows by QEMU

### network settings
IP0=10.0.2.15/24       ## eth0
IP1=192.168.10.10/24   ## eth1
GW=10.0.2.2            ## gateway
DNS=10.0.2.3

### configure eth0
ip link set dev eth0 up
ip address flush dev eth0
ip address add $IP0 dev eth0

### configure eth1
ip link set dev eth1 up
ip address flush dev eth1
ip address add $IP1 dev eth1

### set the gateway
ip route add to default via $GW

### set the DNS server
echo "nameserver $DNS" &gt; /etc/resolv.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
To check that the network configuration is okay, run <tt  >ip
addr</tt>,
<tt  >ip route</tt> and <tt  >cat
/etc/resolv.conf</tt>. Here's output from
these commands:

Now, all that remains is making sure the network is working
as expected. The first check is to ping from Linux 10.0.2.2. If it is
not working, it's possible that you need to switch eth0 and eth1.
Sometimes, the network interface with MAC 52:54:00:12:34:56 is
recognized by Linux as eth0, and the other as eth1, and sometimes
it is recognized as eth1 and the other as eth0. This depends on
the Linux distribution (Fedora, Slackware or whatever else). So, it is
possible that eth0 and eth1 have gotten the wrong IP addresses from the
configuration script, and in that case, the ping won't work. To solve
this problem, modify the IP addresses that are assigned to eth0 and
eth1 in the script /usr/local/config/net-config-qemu.sh, and run it
again.
</p><p>
Now that the ping with 10.0.2.2 is working, try to ping
192.168.10.2 (tap1) from Linux. In general, it doesn't work. This is
strange, because the ping to 192.168.10.10 from the command
prompt in Windows does work. The problem is with the
Windows firewall. To fix this, open the Control Panel, double-click Windows
Firewall, select Advanced tab, select tap1 and click on Settings,
then choose the ICMP tab, and here, check Allow incoming echo
request. After this, the ping to 192.168.10.2 should work.

Don't try to ping to 10.0.2.15 from the command prompt in Windows,
because it can't possibly work. Do you wonder why? Me too.
</p><p>
The next thing to try is accessing some Linux services from Windows
using the IP 192.168.10.10. Try to open http://192.168.10.10 in a
browser, and you will see the pages that are served by the Linux Web
server. Try also to log in through PuTTY to 192.168.10.10, port 22,
and you will access the Linux shell.
</p><p>
Finally, we have a first-class bidirectional network connection between
Windows and Linux, which can be used to access any
Linux services from Windows.
