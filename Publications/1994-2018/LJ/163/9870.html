I don't write code, but I do write prose. It's different, but there are
similarities and overlaps. Code writers have also supplied me with a
useful cache of metaphors. For example, I can explain my writing method
as a debugging and patching process&mdash;and not just because those are
metaphors for editing. Rather, it's because I regard most of my writing
less as finished work than as useful information that is always subject
to improvement. I'm not just here to express. I'm here to help. (Okay,
sometimes I just joke around, but that's different.)
</p><p>
My model is the most useful tome I've ever read, <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Elements of
Style</em></span>, by William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White. Better known
just as &ldquo;Strunk
and White&rdquo;, the book's 1.0 version
(<a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style" target="_self">en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style</a>) was written in
1918 by Strunk alone, when he was a professor of English at Cornell
University. It was privately published and only 43 pages long.
It began:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This book is intended for use in English courses in which the
practice of composition is combined with the study of literature. It
aims to give in brief space the principal requirements of plain
English style. It aims to lighten the task of instructor and student
by concentrating attention (in Chapters II and III) on a few
essentials, the rules of usage and principles of composition most
commonly violated. The numbers of the sections may be used as
references in correcting manuscripts.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The book is a model of brevity and pith. The paragraph above is first of
the five that make up Chapter I, which fits on a single page. Here is
Strunk's outline for Chapters II and III:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>II. Elementary Rules of Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
1. Form the possessive singular of nouns with <span   class="emphasis"><em>'s</em></span>.
</p><p>
2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use
a comma after each term except the last.
</p><p>
3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.
</p><p>
4. Place a comma before <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>but</em></span> introducing an independent clause.
</p><p>
5. Do not join independent clauses by a comma.
</p><p>
6. Do not break sentences in two.
</p><p>
7. A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to
the grammatical subject.
</p><p>
8. Divide words at line-ends, in accordance with their formation and
pronunciation. 
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
III. Elementary Principles of Composition</b></span>
</p><p>
9. Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each
topic.
</p><p>
10. As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence; end it in
conformity with the beginning.
</p><p>
11. Use the active voice.
</p><p>
12. Put statements in positive form.
</p><p>
13. Omit needless words.
</p><p>
14. Avoid a succession of loose sentences.
</p><p>
15. Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form.
</p><p>
16. Keep related words together.
</p><p>
17. In summaries, keep to one tense.
</p><p>
18. Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Just reading that outline makes you a better writer. Digging deeper has
the same effect. Take #13 from Chapter III: &ldquo;Omit needless
words.&rdquo; It begins:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no
unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the
same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a
machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make
all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his
subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Familiar? Seems to me the same principle applies to writing code. One
difference is that writers of prose generally need to be instructed on
the value of brevity while writers of code do not. That may seem a harsh
or inaccurate statement, but I make it because code is purposeful in
ways prose does not have to be. In fact, blather is sometimes the very
purpose of prose. Garrison Keillor once called English &ldquo;the preacher's
language&rdquo; because &ldquo;it allows you to talk until you think of
what to say.&rdquo;
</p><p>
I suppose you can blather in code too. Back in the late 1990s, I was
sitting in the office of Phil Hughes, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>'s founder and
publisher. He had just come from an argumentative session with a group
of geeks in another room. Imagining I would know what he was talking
about, he threw a pile of code printout onto his desk. &ldquo;Look at
that!&rdquo;,
he said. &ldquo;Six pages of Perl! I could have done the same thing in one
page of awk!&rdquo;
</p><p>
I'm not saying Perl is blather, by the way (though Phil might). I am
saying that omitting needless words is a code-writing value for which
prose writers require help from the likes of William Strunk.
</p><p>
Version 1.5 of Strunk and White came with a 1935 revision by Edward A.
Kenny titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Elements and Practice of
Composition</em></span>. Strunk died in
1946. Far as I know, his book didn't change until 1957, when the writer
E. B. White, once a student of Strunk's, came again upon &ldquo;the
little book&rdquo;
and set about improving it with two short additional chapters and a
return to the original title. This first edition of what came to be
called &ldquo;Strunk and White&rdquo; was version 2.0 of what began as Strunk's
alone. In the 86-page 1979 edition, White explained:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
A second edition of the book was published in 1972. I have now
completed a third revision. Chapter IV has been refurbished with
words and expressions of a recent vintage; four rules of usage have
been added to Chapter I. Fresh examples have been added to some of
the rules and principles, amplification has reared its head in a few
places in the text where I felt an assault could successfully be
made on the bastions of its brevity, and in general the book has
received a thorough overhaul&mdash;to correct errors, delete
bewhiskered entries, and enliven the argument.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
White died in 1985. The 1999 fourth edition of the book has a forward by
White's stepson, Roger Angell, plus an index, a brief afterward by
Charles Osgood and a glossary by Robert DiYanni. The current entry in
Wikipedia notes, &ldquo;An anonymous editor modified the text of this 1999
edition. Among other changes, he or she removed White's spirited defense
of 'he' for nouns embracing both genders. See the 'they' entry in
Chapter IV and also gender-specific pronouns.&rdquo; In his forward, Angell
puts it more gently, &ldquo;This edition has been modestly updated...with a
light redistribution of genders to permit a feminine pronoun or female
farmer to take their places among the males who once innocently served
him. Sylvia Plath has knocked Keats out of the box, and I notice that
'America' has become 'this country' in a sample text, to forestall a
subsequent and possibly demeaning 'she' in the same paragraph.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Astute readers of Strunk, White and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> will observe that we
violate one of the former pair's original commands by putting our
punctuation outside our closing quotation marks, unless it is part of
the quotation. This complies with a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> copy-editing policy established by Phil Hughes in 1994, in
compliance with what had already become geek vernacular. One of my first
arguments with Phil was over this very practice. I lost.
</p><p>
Today if you look for <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Elements of Style</em></span> at Amazon.com, you'll find
three different books: The 1999 fourth edition, Strunk's original
edition and <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Elements of Style Illustrated</em></span>, which (Wikipedia tells
us) is the fourth edition plus illustrations by Maira Kalman. Somehow I
can't help regarding the three as &ldquo;distributions&rdquo; of Strunk's patched
kernel, each useful in its own way.
</p><p>
It's also interesting to read and compare the discussion and history
pages behind the Wikipedia entry for <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Elements of
Style</em></span>. The former
calls to mind the Linux-Kernel Mailing List (LKML), while the latter
serves as a kind of code repository. These analogies are far from
precise, but there is a common purpose in usefulness.
</p><p>
What brought me to this fresh appreciation of usefulness was a blog post
by Alan Mitchell titled &ldquo;Beyond the persuasion paradigm&rdquo;
(<a href="http://rightsideup.blogs.com/my_weblog/2007/08/beyond-the-pers.html" target="_self">rightsideup.blogs.com/my_weblog/2007/08/beyond-the-pers.html</a>).
He writes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Our modern commercial setup is organised around a persuasion
paradigm, where the driving force in commerce is companies and their
attempts to persuade individuals&mdash;so-called consumers&mdash;to buy
their products or services (and not those of their rivals).
</p><p>
We are, however, groping our way towards a personal decision-making
paradigm, whose centre of gravity is helping individuals make and
implement better decisions at lower cost (where &ldquo;cost&rdquo; includes time
and hassle cost, as well as money cost). This is being made possible
by an information age: our increasing ability to search for, gather,
store, filter, edit, slice and dice, analyze, share the information
we need to for our decision-making.
</p><p>
Better personal decision-making (and implementation) is an
era-defining shift for two simple reasons: it shifts the focus of
value creation from companies and their goals to individuals and
their goals, and it encompasses all aspects of production,
distribution and exchange (and a whole lot more)....
</p></blockquote></div><p>
There is in this a declaration of independence for individuals, in heed
of the need to equip human beings with better ways to learn, to make
choices and to exercise their autonomy. What's not clear, and needs to
be, is the role played by programmers in equipping everybody with the
freedom to escape the old persuasion paradigm, and a value system in
which the dependencies that matter most are ones where buyers rely
entirely on sellers.
</p><p>
Free and open-source code does not only express the free choices of its
authors, but it provides practical ways to expand the freedoms of those who
use and depend on that code. Before I read Alan's piece, I didn't see the
connection between proprietary code and a larger paradigm anchored in
persuasion. The problem with proprietary code in many cases begins with
motivation. It's not just about making secret bits and driving up sale
value by making those bits scarce. It's about controlling the customer.
The persuasion paradigm puts a premium on captive, dependent customers.
Worse, it restricts the usefulness of products to just what works for
the seller. This usually involves limiting choices for customers.
</p><p>
What Alan calls the personal decision-making paradigm has been supported
from Day Zero in the Free and Open Source Development world. What we
have here, I submit, is a usefulness paradigm&mdash;one that has had a
quiet and transformative influence on all it supports. Today, that
includes Linux, the Internet and countless other useful goods, all of
which support far more economic vitality and growth than we ever enjoyed
from the persuasion paradigm. (With due credit for all it did achieve in
its day.)
</p><p>
I share that observation with the intent that it will prove useful. If
it's not, we'll patch it, discard it or rewrite it. If it is, any of us
are still free to improve it.
