ASUS Eee PC 700/701</h2></div></div><p>
Fear not, gadget geeks, for in future issues we'll fully cover the new
ASUS Eee PC&mdash;so much so that you'll grumble &ldquo;enough
already!&rdquo; The Eee
PC is a new, ultraportable Linux-based laptop starting at (this is
not a typo) $259 US. ASUS is marketing the 700 model (2GB Flash storage,
256MB of RAM) to first-time/elderly computer users, low-income households
and K&ndash;12 education, while the 701 model (4GB Flash storage, 512MB
of RAM)
is mainly for PC owners seeking convenient mobility. Both models feature
preloaded Xandros Linux, Intel Celeron-M 900MHz processor, 7" display,
10/100Mbps LAN, 802.11 b/g wireless, three USB 2.0 ports, MMC/SD card reader,
VGA out, Windows XP compatibility/drivers, built-in camera (optional on
the 700) and a four-cell battery. There are no optical drives; both models
weigh in at 0.9kg/2lbs. At the time of this writing, ASUS projects that dealers should have the
Eee PC by late September 2007.

Lenovo's ThinkPad T Series Linux Notebooks</h2></div></div><p>
A year ago we saw Lenovo tepidly dip its pinky-toe into the Linux
waters by certifying and supporting its ThinkPad T60p notebook with
user-installed SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (SLED). This year finds
Lenovo frolicking in the balmy Linux Sea, offering SLED preloaded and
supported on its business-oriented ThinkPad T Series. Lenovo says that
strong demand for Linux notebooks from customers made the preload option
inevitable. Preloaded ThinkPads will be available to the general public
in Q4 2007.

Sendio's I.C.E Box E-Mail Integrity Service Appliance</h2></div></div><p>
We've been tracking the buzz surrounding Sendio's I.C.E Box, an e-mail
security appliance that reputedly blocks 100% of spam with no false
positives. Although the I.C.E. Box has been shipping for several months,
its Linux credentials recently came to our attention. Shunning the
antispam filter approach, the I.C.E. Box performs a one-time verification
that the sender of the message is someone with whom you indeed wish
to communicate. The result is an end to the junk while maintaining
legitimate communications. The appliance integrates seamlessly with
any e-mail server and LDAP environment. A built-in Kaspersky antivirus
engine also is included.

Black Duck Software's protexIP</h2></div></div><p>
Software development with open-source code is great, but it can be
complicated. This is why Black Duck Software created protexIP/development
(now v4.4), &ldquo;a platform that helps companies govern how their software
assets are created, managed and licensed.&rdquo; protexIP helps developers and
legal counsel in managing the use of code from open-source projects who
have explicitly decided to switch to GPLv3 and those that have not.
Also included is an enhanced KnowledgeBase, a library of open-source and
vendor-added code software components with detailed licensing information
for more than 140,000 components.

Storix, Inc.'s SBAdmin</h2></div></div><p>
Storix, Inc., recently released SBAdmin v6.2, touted as the first backup and
system recovery solution to integrate with IBM's Tivoli Storage Manager
(TSM). SBAdmin complements TSM's features and capabilities for Linux and
AIX systems. SBAdmin also writes directly to the TSM server, which cuts
extraneous steps, saves time and increases reliability. In addition,
the application provides TSM users with disaster-recovery capabilities,
including a feature called Adaptable System Recovery, which enables
a system restore to the same or dissimilar hardware.

Linux, and the new MOTOMAGX platform is a means for realizing that goal.

Trinity's Digital Audio Workstation</h2></div></div><p>
Here is an audio device that is not brand-new but new to me and hopefully
to you too&mdash;Trinity Audio Group's Trinity Digital Audio Workstation.
This slick, all-in-one device is a portable, professional
recording studio that allows one to do anything imaginable with
linear audio (for example, sample, edit, mix, play back and so on). Trinity does
everything your laptop with an audio interface can do, only more conveniently
and portably. Trinity runs on Linux and works with WAV, MP3 and Ogg
Vorbis files. Several core audio apps are included, such as Audacity,
Hydrogen drum machine, Ardour and more. Built-in 802.11g Wi-Fi lets
you podcast from the field.

IBM's Big Green Linux Initiative</h2></div></div><p>
Thankfully, firms like IBM are starting to look at our serious
environmental problems as challenges rather than barriers. IBM's new Big
Green Linux initiative seeks to leverage Linux and other technologies to
reduce costs and energy consumption by building cooler data centers for
itself and its customers. Big Green Linux is a subset of IBM's broader,
yet similar, Project Big Green. Specifics of Big Green Linux include
server consolidation to System x and System p platforms; new efficient
products, such as the Information Server Blade; contributions to the Linux
kernel (such as tickless low-power state) and others.

SugarCRM</h2></div></div><p>
By the time you flip to this page, SugarCRM will have its sweet
new version 5.0 ready for you. This is the ninth major release of the
popular commercial open-source customer relationship management package.

client and a Multi-Instance On-Demand architecture, are said to &ldquo;enhance

Trusted Computer Solutions' Security Blanket</h2></div></div><p>
Trusted Computer Solutions has long made security solutions for the
CIA and other spy agencies in Washington, DC, and now its new product,
Security Blanket, aims to harden your Linux system with the same fervor.

management tool that enables systems administrators to

Linux operating platform automatically&rdquo;. The product's advantage
is to simplify the

predefined ones that automate industry-standard best practices from the
National Institute of Standards and the Center for Internet Security.
Security Blanket supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.
