Push an array sort out to the sort function instead of writing
a sort routine.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ace580.0x1bc64a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I started talking about how to use some simple shell scripting
techniques to create a computer simulation of the popular dice game
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Yahtzee</em></span>. I'm not going to write the entire game (the computer
player would be darn complicated for a shell script, for one thing),
but let's spend one more column looking at some of the basics of scoring
before we move on to other topics.
</p><p>
One nice thing about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Yahtzee</em></span> as a computer game is that there
really isn't much work for the computer to do, because the game works
fine as a solitaire variation: you simply can play to try to maximize
your score and see how you do, competing against your previous high score.
</p><p>
The basic idea of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Yahtzee</em></span> is that you roll five dice up to three times
to get the best possible set of values. Those are then scored against
a fixed score pad that offers specific points for specific combinations,
ranging from one point per &ldquo;one&rdquo; in your roll up to 50 points for five
of a kind (a &ldquo;Yahtzee&rdquo;, in game parlance).
</p><p>
A quick visit to Google identifies an on-line
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Yahtzee</em></span> score sheet; take a look at it before we proceed:
<a href="http://www.gamingcorner.nl/images/sheets/yahtzee-3.pdf" target="_self">www.gamingcorner.nl/images/sheets/yahtzee-3.pdf</a>.
</p><p>
In many ways, it's five-card draw poker with dice, so the first section
of the score sheet is for sets: ones, twos, threes and so on, where
your score for each is the sum of that value on the dice. The
second section is other poker hands, including three of a kind, four
of a kind, small straight (four of the five dice have sequential values),
large straight (all five are sequential), a full house and one or more Yahtzee rolls.
</p><p>
You can get bonuses for achieving
certain levels, including a very nice 35-point bonus for attaining
at least 63 on the top section, but the score sheet itself is
straightforward.
</p><p>
The key to the game, then, is to figure out how
to score a given roll. If
you roll four ones, do you want to score that as your four of a kind or
your ones? What if they're both filled in already? Fortunately, we're
going to defer to the player for that, but that still leaves us with
the data question of how to model the different boxes on the score sheet
and the interface question of how to prompt the user to select which
box to score. Let's take a look.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ace580.0x1bc6b30"></a>
Modeling the Score Sheet as an Array</h2></div></div><p>
As with most of these types of data structures, we'll use an array to
model the score sheet. Count the boxes on the score sheet, and you'll see
13 boxes total, including the special Yahtzee box where
you can roll&mdash;and get credit for&mdash;more than one (so a game typically
has 13 rolls, but it could have more).
</p><p>
If we initialize the game by filling in all the array values with a known
stop value, say -1, then the test for whether a given box has been filled
in is easy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ scoresheet[1] != -1 ] ; then
  echo "1: Your one's" ; fi
</pre>
</p><p>
The trick is that we also want to pre-qualify these options. There's no point in
prompting players to select their roll as a Yahtzee if they didn't
get five of a kind. This proves to be a bit tricky, so as a first step,
I'm going to tweak the code to order the dice in the array
in ascending order after each roll automatically.
</p><p>
It might be a long trip to accomplish the task, but rather than write
a sorting routine in the script, I'm just going to push out the task to
the sort function, then read the results back in and fit them into the
individual slots of the dice array. Sound complicated? It is, rather:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function sortDice()
{
   sorted="$( ( echo ${dice[1]} ; echo ${dice[2]}
     echo ${dice[3]} ; echo ${dice[4]}
     echo ${dice[5]} ) | sort )"

   index=1
   for value in $sorted ; do
     dice[$index]=$value
     index=$(( $index + 1 ))
   done
}
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see here that I'm using a temp variable called sorted to store
the resultant values, and that I'm using a subshell&mdash;that's the $( )
notation&mdash;to do the actual work. The hardest part of this little
function is to figure out how to put the values back into the array once
everything's sorted properly, and that's accomplished with the for loop.
</p><p>
Notice that, by a lucky coincidence, for loops automatically step through
fields separated by white space (spaces and carriage returns), so it's perfect
for breaking the resultant sorted sequence back into individual values.
</p><p>
We're running low on space this month, and I'm afraid I've ended
up spending quite a bit of time talking, rather than coding. I'll make
it up to you, dear reader, next month!
