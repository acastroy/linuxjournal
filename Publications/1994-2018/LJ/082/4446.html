processes large satellite and aerial images for commercial
businesses. This job requires processing gigabytes of image data
through computationally expensive algorithms for three-dimensional
projections, image processing and complex data fusions. This
article describes the conversion of ImageLinks to Linux and the
resulting benefits.
</p><p>In 1996, ImageLinks was allowed to commercialize previously
classified government software. This consisted of over 5,000 source
code files of object-oriented C++ code that was developed over a
period of 15 years. The business was established on high-end SGI
and Sun platforms with associated servers. We were leasing over a
half-million dollar's worth of equipment, resulting in a monthly
payment of over $15,000. Aside from the equipment, costs there were
expensive proprietary-software licenses for compilers, tools and
libraries. At the time, even memory upgrades had to be purchased
through the vendor at a high cost so as not to invalidate our
maintenance agreements.</p><p>

CPU-bound.</p></div></div>
</p><p>Several of the technical staff were already using Linux on
home machines, and we wondered what would be involved in porting
our production software. After a discussion one day at lunch we
decided to stop by the local computer parts store, purchased what
we needed on the company credit card and started a backroom
operation to port all of the code.</p><p>We installed Red Hat 5.2 and began the porting process. Over
the next couple of months Dave Burken and Ken Melero passed the
project back and forth, finding and correcting platform
dependencies. At the time, the main roadblock was heavily templated
code that the compiler didn't handle correctly. With the release
and installation of Red Hat 6.0, the GCC compiler was able to
handle the templates directly, and the porting effort was completed
rapidly.</p><p>Our initial assumption was that a Linux port on Intel
platforms would result in a much more cost-effective solution, but
we didn't believe that the performance would match the higher-end
workstations. Fortunately, we were wrong on the second assumption.
The first indications that we would gain significant performance
improvements on the Linux platforms were observed with the
compilation times. A &ldquo;make World&rdquo; to compile all of the source
code for our software would take anywhere from 10 to 12 hours on
the SGI Indigo 2s. This same compilation was completed in less than
two hours on a dual-processor Pentium box&mdash;even more telling was
the size of the executables that was generated. The output from the
gcc tools was generating executables that were approximately half
the size of the proprietary compilers. This was an indication of
the superior code optimization that was one of the many benefits of
the open-source development tools. This performance was quite
evident when we deployed a couple of test Linux machines into
production. The most extreme example was cross-sensor image fusion
runs.</p><p>Cross-sensor fusion products are made by combining different
classes of satellite images in order to create a new product. For
example, we often combine high-resolution black-and-white imagery
with low-resolution multispectral (color) imagery. The images are
typically acquired from different points of view, at different
resolutions, scales and times. All of these factors are taken into
consideration as complex transformations are performed in
three-dimensional space to project from the satellite image to an
internal three-dimensional model of the space. Once this is
performed, intelligent resamplers traverse the three-dimensional
model to combine the pixels into the desired map projection and
scale. This involves the processing of gigabytes of digital image
data through complex image processing and three-dimensional
transforms. It was not unusual for some of these production runs to
take a weekend of processing on the proprietary workstations. With
the Linux machines, we have observed almost an order of magnitude
increase in performance on these fusions. This dramatic increase is
due to the higher performance of commodity hardware coupled with
optimized code from the software tools.</p><p>The next major benefit came from applying Beowulf clusters to
our production runs. Beowulf clusters can be simply explained as a
bunch of computers linked together with commodity networking for a
cost-effective supercomputing solution. Most installations use
Linux boxes with optimized kernels that are linked together with
Ethernet communications on a local network. One node is designated
as the master node controlling the scheduling of the slave nodes
and all communications with the outside world. In the past,
supercomputers required the software to be handcrafted for the
specific architecture of the supercomputer. Recent advances in
parallel libraries such as PVM and MPI have made this task much
more generic. With these libraries the programmers can identify
areas of the code that can be made parallel. The libraries then
take care of the details of mapping it to the super computer
architecture. Fortunately, our algorithms are extremely
CPU-intensive and coarsely parallel. In other words, the codes are
dominated by floating point mathematical computations, and the
problems can be split into parts that don't require significant
communication between the processors. Our implementation involved
segmenting the imagery into tiles and passing them out to different
boxes for processing.</p><p>We built a 14-node cluster, wired PVM into our code and
observed linear scaling in performance as we added processors to
the cluster. A trace of the execution shows that there are brief
periods of communication data passing to the nodes, then the nodes
spend a considerable amount of time performing the necessary
calculations. This turns out to be an ideal situation for the
application of clustering&mdash;to go faster and push more data we can
just add more processors. With the Beowulf cluster in place, the
complex cross-sensor fusion jobs dropped another order of
magnitude. Jobs that took a weekend on the proprietary machines,
which were reduced to hours on a single Linux machine, can now run
in minutes through the Beowulf cluster.</p><p>In addition to performance and cost, also our business has
witnessed additional benefits including improved stability,
documentation and rapid software updates.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mark Lucas</b></span> is
