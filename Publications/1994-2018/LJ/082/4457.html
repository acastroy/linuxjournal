(<span   class="bold"><b>ipconfig</b></span>) that lets you see the
current ip configuration. Is there a utility in Linux for
this?  &mdash;Skip Bigelow, sbigelow@aarp.org</p><p>Even though there are graphical tools to give the information
you've asked (including Red Hat's
<span   class="bold"><b>netcfg</b></span> command), you can always
use <b  >/sbin/ifconfig</b>. It will give you detailed
information regarding all active interfaces (ethernet, ppp,
loopback etc.).  &mdash;Mario, mneto@argo.com.br</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e1348"></a>Sharing a Cable Modem</h2></div></div><p>I have been browsing many different Linux web sites to look
for any FAQ or guide on this topic: How to share a cable modem
connection at home between a Linux and a Windows machine, which is
where the cable modem installed. I would appreciate it if you would
give me some pointers.  &mdash;Samuel Fung, samfz@hotmail.com</p><p>I would move the cable modem to the Linux machine and share
it with your other computers from there. Why? Because Windows has
no provision, off the shelf, to serve as a router, enable security
features such as packet filtering, masquerading, forwarding, etc.,
while Linux does all that quite naturally and quite well. You do
not specify the cable modem you have, but I would suggest looking
at
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org" target="_self">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</a>
for documents on networking and connecting network devices to your
Linux box. After that, look at the how-to articles on connecting to
an ISP.  &mdash;Felipe Barousse, fbarousse@piensa.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e1500"></a>Booting without Messages</h2></div></div><p>Is it possible to turn off the kernel boot-up messages?
&mdash;Nicholas, vunch@pacific.net.sg</p><p>The easiest way is to set console=ttyS3,38400n8, or something
similar, on the LILO command line to redirect console output to a
serial port.  &mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22e9580.0x23e1660"></a>Root Compromise</h2></div></div><p>When I tried to log in to my Linux box this morning, I was
surprised to find out that I was no longer able to do this. The
login prompt appears as usual, but when I type the user name and
press Enter, instead of the password prompt a new login prompt
appears. No messages appear except a line that says:
<b  >/var/hackr0x/login: No such file or directory</b>.
This line disappears so quickly that I had to repeat the procedure
of typing the user name a couple of times in order to decipher
it.  &mdash;Victor, victor@angolatelecom.com</p><p>Your machine was indeed compromised. At this point you don't
want to fix your machine, you just want to get your data off and
re-install it. You don't know what's been modified nor how. In
cases where you can't log in at all, you can always boot with
<b  >linux init=/bin/bash</b> at the LILO prompt, and
then do: <b  >mount -wno remount/mount -a
/etc/rc.d/init.d/network start</b> (if you want to back up
data over the Net). You can also boot from a rescue floppy or CD.
Once you get your machine re-installed, do not just connect it to
the Internet again without securing it properly. Make sure you have
all the updates installed; do not run any unnecesary d&aelig;mons,
and firewall the machine if possible.  &mdash;Marc Merlin,
marc_bts@valinux.com</p><p>Every major distribution has an &ldquo;announce&rdquo; list for
security updates. After you reinstall, get on the list for the
distribution you run. Also, remove unused software&mdash;it's the
cheapest, fastest security precaution you can take.  &mdash;Don Marti,

configuring one in a client organization. I found the following
lines in the script that applies the rules of the firewall
(IPCHAINS):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INT0="eth0"
IP0="192.168.1.125/24"
NET0="192.168.1.0"

NET0="192.168.1.0,192.168.10.0"
</pre><p>&mdash;Fabio Losnak, fabiolosnak@yahoo.com
</p><p>The &ldquo;/24&rdquo; in the IP number means the network 192.168.1.0
with a netmask of /24 or 255.255.255.0. You probably cannot put two
networks in the same variable but that would really depend on the
script that is parsing this.  &mdash;Marc Merlin,

7.0, Sendmail Single Switch) that acts as both an SMTP and POP3
server.</p><p>We need to be able to differentiate between local-only and
WAN e-mail accounts. Local-only accounts would be limited to local
delivery/receipt and WAN accounts would be granted access to the
world for inbound and outbound mail.</p><p>To further complicate matters, all users
should have the format of first.last@domain.com for e-mail
addresses. Is there a method of doing this within the capabilities
of Sendmail or, if not, what package(s) will allow me to do
this?  &mdash;Michael Phillips, mike.phillips@ieionline.com</p><p>There are many approaches to solve your riddle. For instance,
an easy one would be to restrict e-mail relaying with the
/etc/mail/access file on an client IP address basis. Your actual
request is not a complex one, you just need a bit of a planning on
your network layout, the addressing scheme and a bit of tuning on
the Sendmail side. Go to the
<a href="http://www.sendmail.org" target="_self">http://www.sendmail.org/</a>
site and look for all relaying-related documents. That will help
you solve your requirements.  &mdash;Felipe Barousse,

out after about five minutes.  &mdash;Jan Dubroca,
jan.dubroca@delta-air.com</p><p>You are probably Telneting outside of your network, through
an IP masquerading server that times out TCP connections after five
minutes. On Linux, the fix for this (on the firewall) is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Fix the masquerading timeouts

</p><p>I don't believe that there is a tim-eout setting for Telnet.
I assume that what's timing out is your shell. The shell time-out
can be set in <b  >/etc/profile</b>. My guess is you've
got an entry that looks something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
TMOUT=300
</pre><p>The value here is in seconds. You can change this
to give yourself more time or simply remove the line to disable
shell time-out completely.  &mdash;Paul Christensen,

</p><p>When I booted my computer from the floppy disk (Win98

Red Hat CD-ROM. Unexpected, it appeared that I had installed Linux
successfully and even configured the X Windows System well. In the

Congratulations, you have installed linux successfully,......
The system reboot....
</pre><p>And when it rebooted, this message appeared:
<pre     class="programlisting">

Then the computer stopped again.
</p><p>I have also tried Red Hat 5.0, Bluepoint1.0 and 2.0,
TurboLinux, Slackware. The results were all the same. WHY?
&mdash;ekun, xx@public1.ptt.js.cn</p><p>Apparently, you can boot Linux from
<span   class="bold"><b>loadlin</b></span> (which you did when you
started the Linux install from Windows), but, for some unknown
reason, it fails when you boot with LILO. One option is to do an
install from Windows, like you already did, and then boot from the
RH rescue CD-ROM. Copy your kernel (<b  >in/boot</b>) to
the Windows partition (which you will need to mount too). Copy and
configure loadlin (you should have them on your RH CD-ROM), and use
loadlin to boot Linux. A sample loadlin config from my system looks
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
moremagic:/drv/c$ cat linux.bat
c:\linux\loadlin\loadlin @c:\linux\loadlin\boot
moremagic:/drv/c$ cat linux/loadlin/boot
c:\linux\loadlin\vmlinuz
root=/dev/sda6
ro
</pre><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com
</p><p>I've seen this happen as the result of booting a kernel
that's optimized for the wrong processor, but if this is happening
right away after a fresh install (in fact, after EVERY install of
any of a number of distributions) you most likely have a serious
hardware problem. You should try different RAM if you have any
available. I can't say for sure that the RAM is the culprit, but
that's where I'd start.  &mdash;Robert Connoy,
