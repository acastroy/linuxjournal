Hacker</h2></div></div><p>Who writes your &ldquo;THE GOOD/THE BAD&rdquo; box? Couldn't (s)he at
least read the article this is supposed to summarize? For example,
the article tells us how much better the install has gotten, and
the box says &ldquo;The worst install ever&rdquo;. Hello? Anybody at home
there?</p><p>Hmm. What does &ldquo;kernel 2.4.0test8&rdquo; do in a &ldquo;Hardware
Profile&rdquo;? And why is it mentioned at all? Nothing in the rest of
the article talks about that, and there's certainly no such
pre-alpha kernel in the distribution.</p><p>I see that &ldquo;several packages are in need of updating&rdquo;, but
no specific package is mentioned. Somehow, I'm not particularly
surprised.</p><p>Now <span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> is truely offensive. If you had
bothered to actually look, you'd have noticed that none of the
compatibility libraries are needed for Debian-compiled programs:
they're there for compatibility with foreign binaries. There's even
support for compiling to old libraries for people who need that,
though libc5 support may finally vanish in the next version unless
our users tell us that they <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> want us to
retain it.</p><p>&ldquo;There is a plan to remove the boot floppy altogether from
future distributions&rdquo;. Nope, no such plan. There
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a plan to replace the installer on those
floppies with a modularized version.</p><p>&ldquo;Debians package management system is also incredibly
cryptic.&rdquo; Hmm, well, what I've seen of rpm so far certainly didn't
impress me as any less cryptic, and though most Debian developers
agree dselect needs replacement with something more modern, I've
seen users praise it more than once. Of course, that's all personal
opinion, but my impression is that a number of people only find the
stuff cryptic because they were told to expect it to be cryptic.
Personally, I think a typical Windows-like GUI installer is
horribly cryptic.</p><p>&ldquo;...a URI, which is similar to an URL&rdquo;. Ouch. Short
tutorial follows: A URI (Universal Resource Identifier) can be
either a URN (Universal Resource Name) or a URL (Universal Resource
Locator). It's a URN if it's &ldquo;stable forever&rdquo;, such as
urn:isbn:0-345-38851-8; it's a URL if it tells you how to find the
named resource, such as
<a href="/" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/</a>. It can be
both.</p><p>You know there's a saying that one should judge publications
by how they talk about a subject one is familiar with? By that
measure, this issue makes for a pretty steep drop in credibility.
OTOH, I've seen better articles before, so I'll just chalk this one
up to a sort of one-off.</p><p>&mdash;MfG Kaikaih@khms.westfalen.de</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1301580.0x13f9608"></a>Retro Linux</h2></div></div><p>Don Marti's &ldquo;Building the Ultimate Linux Workstation&rdquo;
brings back fond memories of a similar article about 17 years back.
&ldquo;80 Micro&rdquo; ran a feature comparing a couple of custom-built
screamers. At about $3,000 apiece, I could only dream about buying
one of those state-of-the-art machines.</p><p>Those blazing hot TRS-80 Model-III-compatible systems boasted
an unbelievably fast 5MHz Z80B CPU, 128K of bank-switched RAM (the
Z80 had the on-chip hardware to address only 64K), and get this, a
5 Meg hard drive, enough to store most people's entire collection
of floppies. Eat your heart out, fellas.</p><p>Those folks lucky enough to have one of these rockets stored
in their attic need to start putting the pressure on for porting
the kernel to the Z80 chip. For that matter, there is a shameful
lack of drivers for such critically important legacy hardware as
the Friden Flexowriter, magnetic core memory, reel-to-reel tape
drives, the KSR-33 teletype terminal and the paper tape
reader/punch (much better to save cartons of punched tape than all
those tacky CDRs). Hey, get on the stick, Linus. We want
retro-Linux and we want it now!</p><p>&mdash;Mendel Cooperthegrendel@theriver.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1301580.0x13f9818"></a>Exploiting Explorer</h2></div></div><p>Upon opening the November, 2000 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> to page 199, I almost fell out of my chair.
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, the premier magazine for the
Linux community, had an advertisement (for Axis Communications)
with a screen shot of a Microsoft Internet Explorer window. Is it
really so much about the mighty dollar that you have no
restrictions as to the content of your advertisers' ads? At a
minimum, you could have made it look like a Netscape window. I
truly enjoy <i  >Linux Journal</i>, and usually read it
in its entirety, on the same day it is delivered. The last thing I
want to see is an advertisement for a product (that runs on just
about any platform) being depicted running in the Windows
environment.</p><p>Thanks for a great magazine,</p><p>&mdash;Jerry Readjerry@jread.net</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1301580.0x13f9ad8"></a>Be Specific</h2></div></div><p>Through my letter box came a smoking issue. I loved the cover
and the feature articles on building an Ultimate Linux Workstation
(or even a lower budget version). I coveted all of these
configurations, which were better than the surplus Celeron-based
system I'd just commissioned as my personal Linux workstation to
replace a failed 486-based Linux box (don't laugh&mdash;that 486-based
workstation gave better performance than many high-price Windows
boxes).</p><p>As I read these articles though, a long-running frustration
of mine resurfaced. Many years ago I studied AI and expert systems
when the computing science literature was full of talk about a
hardware configuration system at Digital (now Compaq). Their
system, known as either R1 or xcon, would check that a hardware
configuration was viable. If not the system would remind the
engineering team what needed to be added and finally generate a
detailed list for the installation engineer to follow so that
boards were plugged into the correct bus slots. With all the
hardware options for Linux I've long thought that a similar expert
system was necessary.</p><p>Obviously such a system needs a database containing what
motherboard has what features, what hardware is necessary for a
server and what is needed for a low-end/high-end workstation, etc.
Specific issues with hardware options could be highlighted, e.g.,
what EIDE drives to avoid and why, what ASICs don't work correctly,
whether to use Intel or AMD processors, whether Alpha or PowerPC
chips would be more appropriate, what video cards have only partial
support in XFree86, what software need not be installed on a
workstation and what is required on a server, how many fans are
needed and where should they be mounted, even down to issuing
reminders to the installer of applicable CERT advisories.
Extensions could help configure Beowulf clusters, firewalls,
diskless workstations, laptops and many other useful setups.</p><p>I wanted a summary at the end of the Ultimate Linux box
article of the various suggested hardware configurations. A simple
spreadsheet (gnumeric of course) helped to collate all that advice
and price it. In that respect the following article on the cheaper
workstation was a better source of information. But being able to
feed these configurations into an R1/xcon-like system would have
been really helpful&mdash;especially if it held up-to-date price
information. Then I'd know which supplier to buy which components
from so I could get that ultimate workstation at the lowest
cost.</p><p>If anyone is working on such a configuration tool I'd love to
hear from them and/or to read about it in <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>&mdash;Trevor Jenkinstrevor@suneidesis.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1301580.0x13f9df0"></a>What about Tapeware?</h2></div></div><p>I just finished reading the Readers' Choice Awards and find
it interesting that no one mentioned Tapeware from Yosemite
software for backup.</p><p>We have used both tar and BRU but find Tapeware to be far
superior to either. It is a distributed application (in the class
of Arkei, I suppose?) and runs seamlessly distributed across both
Windows and Linux platforms. The GUI is QT-based, which makes it
look and feel exactly the same between Windows and Linux.</p><p>Just thought I'd mention this product since no one seems to
know it exists.</p><p>&mdash;Bud Millwoodbudm@weird-solutions.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1301580.0x13fa000"></a>Uses for CueCat</h2></div></div><p>Good job with the CueCat article!</p><p>Living in Europe, I wondered why so much buzz about a bar

backward engineering efforts by publishing both the method and the
results. At least it makes life a bit more uncomfortable for

&ldquo;Building the Ultimate Linux Workstation&rdquo; and came across a
couple of quotes from Darryl Strauss that I thought shouldn't have
been there. He states: &ldquo;The up-and-coming board to watch is the
Radeon&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Performance is about the same as the GeForce2, and
they want to do open-source drivers. It's just not out for Linux
yet&rdquo;</p><p>I would like to focus on the &ldquo;they want to do open-source
drivers. It's just not out for Linux yet&rdquo; part. Let me spare
anyone from the hell that I have gone through with ATI in the past
and I ask that a little research be done on ATI specifically before
the readers and subscribers of <i  >Linux Journal</i>
are recalling where they got the idea to buy the damn thing to
begin with.</p><p>ATI has promised 3-D drivers for their cards under Linux for
almost two years now. When an actual 3-D driver that is usable (and
when I say usable thats exactly what I mean; drivers that make
quake3 actually run a bit faster than the couple pixels a second
you get, try for yourself) has yet to be seen. UTAH-GLX is not
developed by ATI or anyone they've hired. They've hired the
guys/gals at Precision Insight sometime ago
(<a href="http://www.precisioninsight.com" target="_self">http://www.precisioninsight.com/</a>),
and they (ATI) promised to have ATI 3-D drivers available in Q1 of
2000. Needless to say Q1 of 2000 came, and they had no usable
drivers; Q2 came, still no drivers. Q3 came, you get the
idea.</p><p>They consistently boast on their web site that they have 3-D
drivers for the Rage 3-D pro cards, which is correct but it's not
their drivers; and it's not supported by ATI. You can find them
here (UTAH-GLX)
<a href="http://utah-glx.sourceforge.net" target="_self">utah-glx.sourceforge.net</a>.
The Rage 128 3-D drivers are available here at dri.sourceforge.net,
which happens to be Precision Insight's DRI project. Mind the
Precision Insight drivers don't do much and aren't usable. So
whatever you do, PLEASE do not buy the ATI Radeon before the
drivers are completed and usable. DO NOT make the same mistake I
made when I bought this ATI rage fury. Personally I'll never buy
another ATI card again; not because of the hardware, which is of
high quality, but because they don't support their hardware with
drivers.</p><p>&mdash;Christopher Warnerchristopher.warner@mvbms.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1301580.0x13faa50"></a>Ada's Shortcomings</h2></div></div><p>I work with Ada quite a bit at work and enjoyed seeing the
article on Ada in the latest issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I have to agree that many programmers should
take a serious look at the language. It is highly structured, and I
would guarantee that novice programmers will decrease their
debugging time and their frustrations tremendously by using the
language. Many C++ programmers could learn a great deal of
discipline sorely lacking in that language by taking the time to
learn Ada.</p><p>With that said, I do have to take issue with some of the
statements made in the article. First, Ada does not provide a full
suite of operator overloading/overriding capabilities. It does not
allow overriding of the assignment operator nor the array indexing
operator. Also, you cannot specify a return by reference in Ada.
The latter two difficulties can be a great hassle when developing
container classes, since it makes the specification used by clients
clumsy. The language also does not support type promotions, which
can again lead to unnecessarily clumsy interfaces.</p><p>Ada does not have inferred templates (known as &ldquo;generics&rdquo;
in Ada). Generics must be instantiated explicitly, and each
instantiation, even if based on the same parameters, represents a
new class incompatible with other instantiations. This can be a
roadblock to software reuse. The language also lacks a notion of
&ldquo;protected&rdquo; in the sense that C++ and Java have; nor does the
language have a construct for declaring an object's attributes
constant over the lifetime of that object. (You should see how
JGNAT works around these issues when providing an Ada-equivalent
API to the Java core classes; it's not pretty.)</p><p>Perhaps one of the biggest drawbacks to the language is that
the compilation of the code requires it to be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; before it
is linked. The binding process creates additional code needed to
elaborate software modules (in the correct order). This prevents
dynamic loading of code at runtime; in other words it prevents
&ldquo;plugins&rdquo;. I believe technologies are now coming out to allow Ada
plugins, but it is not clear that they faithfully adhere to the Ada
standard.</p><p>In short, the article could have done a better job at
pointing out some of the disadvantages as well as some of the
advantages in programming in Ada. Do you have any plans for an
article on Eiffel, another highly disciplined language?</p><p>&mdash;Johnjohn.rusnak@mindspring.com San Jose, CA</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1301580.0x17f2fb8"></a>Errata</h2></div></div><p>The opening paragraph in the January 2001 issue (81) of Doc
Searls' Linux for Suits article, &ldquo;The Morlock Market&rdquo;, is
actually a quote from Neal Stephenson and should have been
separated from the article text and noted as such.</p><p>Listing 2 of John Hall's &ldquo;A Crash Course in SDL&rdquo;, issue 81,
reads, beginning at line 15:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
value= ((red &gt;&gt; fmt-&gt;Rloss) &lt;&lt; fmt-&gt;Rshift) +

           ((blue &gt;&gt; fmt-&gt;Bloss) &lt;&lt; fmt-&gt;Bshift);
return value;
}
</pre><p>But should have read:
<pre     class="programlisting">

           ((green &gt; fmt-&gt;Gloss) &lt;&lt; fmt-&gt;Gshift) +
