    Another potential market widens for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x16ef580.0x17e74a8"></a></h2></div></div><p> With Internet traffic doubling every six
months, networking is one of today's hottest markets. Linux has
always played a key role in servers, but now the door is open for
Linux to penetrate the heart of the Internet: the high-speed
router. These devices, made popular by Cisco Systems, create the
Internet by moving data from place to place.
</p><p>Today, Cisco owns about 80% of the router market. Its
products use a proprietary software stack called IOS to handle all
of the routing functions. But, as the router market continues to
grow rapidly, many new companies are attempting to dethrone Cisco.
Rather than designing their products entirely from scratch, many of
these vendors use a new model that relies on third-party hardware
and software.</p><p>The catalyst for the new model is the network processor. This
new device burst onto the scene a year ago and has already racked
up more than 100 design wins with routers and other networking
equipment. It replaces the custom silicon that Cisco and others
painstakingly develop for each new product. Intel, Motorola, IBM,
AMCC (through its recent purchase of MMC Networks), Lucent and
Vitesse have all jumped into the network-processor market, and
several start-ups are also developing products.</p><p>Internally, network processors are much like standard CPUs,
but their architectures are optimized for handling the packet data
that passes across the Internet. They bring the advantage of
programmability to routers, allowing network equipment vendors to
add features more rapidly to their systems, even in the face of
quickly evolving standards. Buying standard silicon can eliminate
the expensive and time-consuming design cycle for custom
chips.</p><p>This model greatly reduces the barriers to entry that have
helped Cisco repel invaders for the past several years. In this new
world, the router market will begin to look like the PC market,
with many new vendors jumping in building equipment using
off-the-shelf silicon. This competition will reduce Cisco's
dominance and provide router customers with more choices and lower
prices.</p><p>To enable a more PC-like market, however, standard hardware
must be joined by standard software. This is where Linux can play a
role. Linux would not run on the network processor itself, which
executes a fairly limited set of code at high speeds. But every
router contains one or more control processors that oversee the
system and perform any complicated or unusual tasks. For example,
the control processor updates the routing table, an ever-changing
map of the Internet, and translates any packets that are not in the
standard protocols or formats.</p><p>For the control processor, many router vendors use internally
developed software, such as Cisco's IOS, or a real-time operating
system such as VxWorks. But some are moving toward Linux as a more
open environment. For example, MMC recently joined with MontaVista
Software to demonstrate an open-router platform running Hard Hat
Linux. The platform was based entirely on standard silicon from MMC
as well as open-software from MMC and MontaVista. Using these
products as a starting point, an OEM could quickly develop and
deploy a networking system that competes with Cisco's products.
Even with the emergence of off-the-shelf hardware and software, the
router market won't become as commoditized as the PC market. PCs
are customized by their application software, whereas router
vendors must develop all of the software that their equipment will
use. Off-the-shelf products can greatly accelerate time-to-market,
but OEMs will still add features and customize the product to gain
an advantage in a competitive market. Most of this customization
will be in the control-processor software. For this application,
Linux has the advantages of a robust toolset and source-code
availability.</p><p>As the networking market expands, more opportunities emerge
for Linux. As the Internet grows, much of the new traffic is
coming, not from corporate networks, but rather from DSL modems,
cable modems and wireless connections. Network processors are
starting to play a role in the aggregation points for these
connections (known as DSLAMs, cable head-ends and cellular base
stations, respectively). Where off-the-shelf hardware leads, open
software is likely to follow.</p><p>Linux does not have an open path in this market; traditional
RTOS vendors are also pushing their products. But, the networking
community is certainly familiar with the cost and time-to-market
benefits of Linux. Control-processor software can reach millions of
lines of code, so software development becomes a critical issue in
networking products. Smashing through $10 billion in annual
revenue, the router market presents another sizable opportunity for
Linux.</p></div></div>
