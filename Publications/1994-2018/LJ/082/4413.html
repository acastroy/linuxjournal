its simplest two functions: encrypted remote shells and encrypted
file transfers (which is as far as we got last month in this
column). That's fine; there's no point in learning features you
don't need. But many of you highly self-motivated readers
doubtlessly stand to benefit from at least some of SSH's other 99
uses. So let's get down to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> cool
features of SSH, specifically those of OpenSSH.
</p><p>Note: throughout this article I'll use &ldquo;SSH&rdquo; to refer to
Secure Shell generically, i.e., &ldquo;the Secure Shell system&rdquo;.
Specific Secure Shell processes will be displayed in fixed-width
font and in lowercase, e.g., <b  >ssh, sshd,</b> etc.
This is consistent with my other articles: if it looks like
something you'd see typed at a console-prompt, it probably
is.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275f580.0x28577c0"></a>Public-Key Cryptography</h2></div></div><p>A complete description of public-key cryptography (or &ldquo;PK
crypto&rdquo;) simply won't fit in an article that's supposed to be
about OpenSSH. If you're completely unfamiliar with PK crypto, I
highly recommend the RSA Crypto FAQ (available at
<a href="http://www.rsasecurity/rsalabs/faq" target="_self">http://www.rsasecurity/rsalabs/faq/</a>)
or, even better, Bruce Schneier's excellent book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Applied
Cryptography</em></span>.</p><p>For our purposes here, it's enough to say that in a
public-key scheme each user has a pair of keys. Your
<span   class="bold"><b>private key</b></span> is used to digitally
sign things, and to decrypt things that have been sent to you. Your
<span   class="bold"><b>public key</b></span> is used by your
correspondents to verify things that have allegedly been signed by
you and to encrypt data that they want only you to be able to
decrypt.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4413f1.large.jpg"><img src="4413f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Public-Key Cryptography
</p></div></div><p>Along the bottom of Figure 1 we see how two users' key pairs
are used to sign, encrypt, decrypt and verify a message sent from
one user to the other. Note that Bob and Alice possess copies of
each other's public keys but that each keeps their private key
secret.</p><p>As we can see, the message's journey includes four different
key actions: (1) Bob signs a message using his private key; (2) Bob
encrypts it using Alice's public key (NOTE: aside from the fact
that Bob has probably kept a copy of the original message, he can
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> decrypt this message&mdash;only Alice can); (3)
Alice receives the message and decrypts it with her private key;
and (4) Alice uses Bob's public key to verify that it was signed
using his private key.</p><p>Compared to block ciphers such as blowfish and IDEA, in which
the same key is used both for encryption and decryption, this may
seem convoluted. Unlike block ciphers, for which secure
key-exchanges ensure that both parties obtain the key without
exposing the key to eavesdropping or other attacks, PK crypto is
easier to use securely.</p><p>This is because in PK schemes two parties can send encrypted
messages to each other, without first exchanging any secret data
whatsoever. There is one caveat: public-key algorithms are slower
and more CPU-intensive than other classes of cryptographic
algorithms such as block ciphers and stream ciphers (e.g., 3DES and
RC4, respectively). As it happens however, PK crypto can be used to
securely generate keys that can be used in other algorithms.</p><p>In practice, therefore, PK crypto is often used for
authentication (&ldquo;are you really you?&rdquo;) and key-negotiation
(&ldquo;which 3DES keys will we encrypt the rest of this session
with?&rdquo;) but seldom for the bulk encryption of entire sessions
(data streams) or files. This is the case with SSL, and it's also
the case with SSH.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275f580.0x2857e48"></a>Advanced SSH Theory: How SSH Uses PK
Crypto</h2></div></div><p>Key-negotiation is one of the very first things that happens
in any SSH transaction, and the thing that enables a relatively
weak form of authentication (username/password combinations) to be
used. How the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol works is both
beyond the scope of this article and complicated (for more
information, see the Internet Draft entitled
&ldquo;draft-ietf-secsh-transport-07.txt&rdquo;, available at
<a href="http://www.ietf.org" target="_self">http://www.ietf.org/</a>). You
need only to know that the result of this large-prime-number
hoedown is a session key that both parties know but which has not
actually traversed the as-yet-unencrypted connection.</p><p>This session key is used to encrypt the data fields of all
subsequent packets via a &ldquo;block cipher&rdquo; agreed upon by both hosts
(transparently but based on how each SSH process was compiled and
configured). Usually one of the following is used: Triple-DES
(3DES), blowfish, or IDEA. Only after session-encryption begins can
authentication take place.</p><p>But before we dive into RSA/DSA authentication, let's pause
for a moment and consider how key-negotiation can be transparent,
given that it uses PK crypto and that private keys are usually
passphrase-protected. SSH uses two different kinds of key pairs:
<span   class="bold"><b>host keys</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>user keys</b></span>.</p><p>A host key is a special key pair that doesn't have a
passphrase associated with it. Because it can be used without
anybody needing to enter a passphrase first, SSH can negotiate keys
and set up encrypted sessions completely transparent to users. Part
of the SSH installation process is the generation of a host key
(pair). The host key generated at setup time can be used by that
host indefinitely, barring root compromise. And Because the host
key identifies the host, not individual users, each host needs only
one host key. Note that host keys are used by
<span   class="bold"><b>all</b></span> computers that run SSH
regardless of whether they run only the SSH client (ssh), SSH
d&aelig;mon (sshd), or both.</p><p>A user key is a key associated with an individual user and is
used to authenticate that user to the hosts he or she initiates
connections to. Most user keys must be unlocked with the correct
passphrase before being used.</p><p>User keys provide a more secure authentication mechanism than
username/password authentication (even though all authentication
occurs over encrypted sessions). For this reason, SSH by default
always attempts PK authentication before falling back to
username/password.</p><p>When you invoke SSH, SSH checks your $HOME/.ssh directory to
see if you have a private key (named &ldquo;id_dsa&rdquo;). If you do, SSH
will prompt you for the key's passphrase and will then use the
private key to create a signature that will send, along with a copy
of your public key, to the remote server.</p><p>The server will check to see if the public key is an allowed
key (i.e., belonging to a legitimate user and therefore present in
the applicable <b  >$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys2</b>
file). If the key is allowed and identical to the server's
previously stored copy of it, the server will use it to verify that
the signature was created using this key's corresponding private
key. If this succeeds, the server will allow the session to
proceed, possibly after also performing username/password
authentication.</p><p>(Note: the above two paragraphs refer to the DSA
authentication used in SSH Protocol v.2; RSA authentication is
slightly more complicated but, other than using different
filenames, is functionally identical from the user's
perspective.)</p><p>PK authentication is more secure than username/password
because a digital signature cannot be reverse-engineered or
otherwise manipulated to derive the private key which generated it;
neither can a public key. By sending only digital signatures and
public keys over the network, we ensure that even if the session
key is somehow cracked, an eavesdropper still won't be able to
obtain enough information to log on illicitly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275f580.0x2858420"></a>Setting up and Using RSA and DSA
Authentication</h2></div></div><p>Okay. You're ready to enter the next level of ssh-geekdom by
creating yourself a user key pair. Here's what you do.</p><p>First, on your client system (the machine you wish to use as
a remote console) you need to run <b  >ssh-keygen</b>.
You've got some choices: among other things, you can specify either
RSA or DSA keys; key-length; an arbitrary &ldquo;comment&rdquo; field; the
name of the key-files to be written; and the passphrase (if any)
the private key will be encrypted with.</p><p>Now that RSA's patent has expired, choosing the algorithm is
somewhat arbitrary. On the other hand, the SSH protocol v.2, which
is the version submitted to the IETF for consideration as an
Internet Standard, uses DSA keys. If you don't care either way, I
recommend DSA. But if for any reason you want RSA then go for it.
The <b  >-d</b> flag sets DSA as the algorithm, otherwise
RSA is the default.</p><p>Key-length is a more important parameter. Thanks to Adi
Shamir's &ldquo;Twinkle&rdquo; paper (which describes a theoretical but
plausible computer capable of brute-force-cracking RSA/DSA keys of
512 bits or less), I highly recommend you create 1024-bit keys; 768
is okay, but not noticeably faster to use than 1024. However, 2048
is definitely overkill: it isn't significantly more secure, and
slows things down noticeably. The default key-length is 1024, but
you can use the <b  >-b</b> flag followed by a number to
specify a different one.</p><p>The &ldquo;comment&rdquo; field is not used by any ssh process: it's
strictly for your own convenience. I usually set it to my e-mail
address on the local system. That way, if I encounter the key in
<b  >authorized_keys</b> files on my other systems, I
know where it came from. To specify a comment, use the
<b  >-C</b> flag.</p><p>The passphrase and file names can, but needn't be provided in
the command line (using <b  >-N</b> and
<b  >-f</b>, respectively). If missing, you'll be
prompted for them.</p><p><a href="4413l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Generating a DSA User-Key
Pair</a></p><p>In Listing 1, I'm creating a DSA key pair with a key length
of 1024 bits and a comment-string of mbauer@sprecher.enrgi.com. I
let <b  >ssh-keygen</b> prompt me for the file to save
the key in. This will be the name of the private key, and the
public key will be this name with &ldquo;.pub&rdquo; appended to it.</p><p>In this example I've accepted the default filename of id_dsa
(and therefore id_dsa.pub). I've also let
<b  >ssh-keygen</b> prompt me for the passphrase. The
string of asteriks (&ldquo;******************&rdquo;) won't actually appear
when you enter your passphrase&mdash;I inserted those into the example
to indicate that I typed a long passphrase that was not echoed back
on the screen.</p><p>By the way, passphrases are &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; propositions:
your passphrase should either be empty (if you intend to use the
new key as a host key or for scripts that use SSH) or should be a
long string that includes some combination of upper- and lower case
letters, digits and punctuation. This isn't as hard as it may
sound; for example, a line from a song with deliberate but
unpredictable mispellings can be easy to remember but difficult to
guess. The more random the passphrase, the stronger it will
be.</p><p>That's all that must be done on the client side. All that
needs to be done at each remote machine you wish to access from
this host is to add the new public key to
<b  >$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys2</b> (where &ldquo;$HOME&rdquo; is
the path of your home directory).
<b  >authorized_keys2</b> is a list of public keys (one
per very long line) that may be used for login by the user whose
home directory <b  >authorized_keys2</b> resides
in.</p><p>To add your public key to a remote host you have an account
on, simply transfer the file containing your public key
(<b  >id_dsa.pub</b> in the above example) to the remote
host and concatenate it to your <b  >authorized_keys2</b>
file. How you get the file there doesn't matter a whole lot.
Remember, it's your <span   class="emphasis"><em>public</em></span> key, so if it were
to be copied by an eavesdropper en route, there would be no need
for concern. But if you want to be paranoid about it, simply do a
<b  >scp ./id_dsa.pub
remotehostname:/your/homedir</b>--see last month's column for
<b  >scp</b> instructions. To then add it to
<b  >authorized_keys2</b>, log on to the remote host and
enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cat id_dsa.pub &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys2
  (assuming you're in your home directory)
</pre><p>That's it! Now whenever you log in to that remote host using
SSH, the session will look something like what you see in Listing
2.
</p><p><a href="4413l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. Logging in Using DSA
Keys</a></p><p>Notice that when I invoked <b  >ssh</b> in the
listing, I used the <b  >-2</b> flag: this instructs SSH
to try SSH Protocol v.2 only. By default Protocol v.1 is used, but
v.1 only supports RSA keys and we just copied over a DSA key. Note
also that the key is referred to by its local path/filename: this
is a reminder that when we use RSA or DSA authentication the
passphrase we enter is only used <span   class="emphasis"><em>locally</em></span> to
&ldquo;unlock&rdquo; our locally stored private key and is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> sent over the network in any form.</p><p>There's one last thing I should mention about the simple
example above. It makes two assumptions about the remote server:
(1) that I have the same username as I do locally and (2) that the
remote server recognizes SSH Protocol v.2. If the first assumption
isn't true I need to use the <b  >-l</b> flag to specify
my username on the remote host. (Alternatively, I can skip
<b  >-l</b> and instead use scp-style username@hostname
syntax, e.g., mick@zippy.pinheads.com.)</p><p>If Protocol v.2 isn't supported by the remote
<b  >sshd</b> d&aelig;mon I'll have to try again without
the <b  >-2</b> flag and let SSH fall back to
username/password authentication, unless I've got an RSA key pair
whose public key is registered on the remote machine.</p><p>To do all this with RSA keys we follow the same steps but
with different filenames:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Create an RSA user-key pair with
<b  >ssh-keygen</b>, for example:</p></li></ol></div><pre     class="programlisting">
ssh-keygen -b 1024 -C mbauer@homebox.pinheads.com
</pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>On each remote host you wish to connect to, copy
your public key onto its own line in the file
<b  >authorized_keys</b> in your
<b  >$HOME/.ssh</b> directory. (The default filenames for
RSA keys are identity and identity.pub.)</p></li></ol></div><p>Again, if you run <b  >ssh</b> without the
<b  >-2</b> flag, it will try RSA authentication by
default.
</p><p>What happens if you forget your RSA or DSA key's passphrase?
How will you get back into the remote machine to change the
now-unusable-key's authorized_keys file? Not to worry: if you
attempt RSA or DSA authentication and fail for any reason, SSH will
revert to username/password authentication and prompt you for your
password on the remote system.</p><p>If you wish to disable this &ldquo;fallback&rdquo; mechanism and
maintain a strict policy of RSA/DSA logins only, change the
parameter <b  >PasswordAuthentication</b> to &ldquo;no&rdquo; in
<b  >sshd_config</b> on each remote host running
<b  >sshd</b>. As long as we're talking about the
server-side of the equation, note that by default
<b  >sshd</b> allows both RSA and DSA authentication when
requested by an <b  >ssh</b> client process. The
<b  >sshd_config</b> parameters to explicitly allow or
disallow these are <b  >RSAAuthentication</b> and
<b  >DSAAthentication</b>, respectively.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275f580.0x2850570"></a>Making Strong Authentication Simpler with
ssh-agent</h2></div></div><p>Establishing one or more user keys improves authentication
security and harnesses more of SSH's power than username/password
authentication. It's also the first step in using SSH in shell
scripts. There's just one small obstacle to automating the things
we've done with PK crypto: even though the PK crypto-based
authentication is transparent, the preliminary key-authorization
isn't. How can we safely skip or streamline that process?</p><p>There are several ways. One is to create a key with no
passphrase, in which case none will be prompted for whenever the
key is used. (We'll talk about passphrase-less keys in a moment.)
Another way is to use <b  >ssh-agent</b>.</p><p><b  >ssh-agent</b> is, essentially, a
private-key-cache in RAM that allows you to use your private key
repeatedly after entering its passphrase just once. When you start
<b  >ssh-agent</b> and then load a key into it with
<b  >ssh-add</b>, you are prompted for the key's
passphrase, after which the &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; private key is held in
memory in such a way that all subsequent invocations
<b  >ssh</b> and <b  >scp</b> will be able to
use the cached, unlocked key without re-prompting for its
passphrase.</p><p>This might sound insecure, but it isn't. First, only a
<b  >ssh-agent</b> process' owner can use the keys loaded
into it. For example, if &ldquo;root&rdquo; and &ldquo;bubba&rdquo; are both logged in
and each have started their own <b  >ssh-agent</b>
processes and loaded their respective private keys into them, they
cannot get at each other's cached keys; there is no danger of bubba
using root's credentials to run scp or ssh processes.</p><p>Second, <b  >ssh-agent</b> listens only to local
<b  >ssh</b> and <b  >scp</b> processes; it is
not directly accessible from the network. In other words, it is a
local service, not a network service per se. There is no danger,
therefore, of an outside would-be intruder hijacking or otherwise
compromising a remote <b  >ssh-agent</b> process.</p><p>Using <b  >ssh-agent</b> is fairly straightforward:
simply enter <b  >ssh-agent</b> and execute the commands
it prints to the screen. This last bit may sound confusing, and
it's certainly non-instinctive: before going to the background,
<b  >ssh-agent</b> prints a brief series of
environment-variable declarations appropriate to whichever shell
you're using that must be made before you can add any keys. Simply
select these commands using your mouse and right click to paste
them at a command prompt to execute them (see Listing 3).</p><p><a href="4413l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. Invoking
ssh-agent</a></p><p>In Listing 3, I'm one third of the way there: I've started a
<b  >ssh-agent</b> process, and
<b  >ssh-agent</b> has printed out the variables I need
to declare using BASH syntax.</p><p>All I need to do now is select everything after the first
line above and before the last line (as soon as I release the left
mouse-button this text will be copied), and right click over the
cursor on the last line (which will paste the previously selected
text into that spot). I may need to hit the enter key for that last
<b  >echo</b> to be performed, but that echo isn't really
necessary anyhow.</p><p>Note that the above cut and paste will work in any xterm, but
for it to work at a tty (text) console <b  >gpm</b> will
need to be running. If all else fails, you can always type the
declarations manually.</p><p>Once <b  >ssh-agent</b> is running and
SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID have been declared and exported,
it's time to load your private key. Simply type
<b  >ssh-add</b> followed by a space and the name (with
full path) of the private key you wish to load. If you don't
specify a file, it will automatically attempt to load
$HOME/.ssh/identity. Since that's the default name for an RSA
user-private-key, if yours is named something else or if you wish
to load a DSA key you'll need to specify its name, including its
full path, e.g., <b  >ssh-add
/home/mbauer/.ssh/id_dsa</b>.</p><p>You can use <b  >ssh-add</b> as many times (to load
as many keys) as you like. This is useful if you have both an RSA
and a DSA key pair and access different remote hosts running
different versions of SSH (i.e., some that only support RSA keys
and others that accept DSA keys).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275f580.0x2851280"></a>Passphrase-Less Keys for Maximum
Scriptability</h2></div></div><p><b  >ssh-agent</b> is useful if you run scripts
from a logon session or if you need to run <b  >ssh</b>
and/or <b  >scp</b> repeatedly in a single session. But
what about <b  >cron</b> jobs? Obviously,
<b  >cron</b> can't perform username/password
<span   class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> enter a passphrase for PK
authentication.</p><p>This is the place to use a passphrase-less key pair. Simply
run <b  >ssh-keygen</b> as described above, but instead
of entering a passphrase when prompted hit the enter key. You'll
probably also want to enter a filename other than &ldquo;identity&rdquo; or
&ldquo;id_dsa&rdquo;, unless the key pair is to be the default user key for
some sort of special account used for running automated
tasks.</p><p>To specify a particular key to use in either an
<b  >ssh</b> or <b  >scp</b> session, use the
<b  >-i</b>. For example, if I'm using
<b  >scp</b> in a <b  >cron</b> job that copies
logfiles, my <b  >scp</b> line might look like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
scp -i /etc/script_dsa_id /var/log/messages.*
   scriptboy@archive.g33kz.org
</pre><p>When the script runs, this line will run without requiring a
passphrase: if the passphrase is set to &lt;Enter&gt;, SSH is smart
enough to not bother to prompt the user.
</p><p>But remember, on the remote-host-side I'll need to make sure
the key in <b  >/etc/script_dsa_id.pub</b> has been added
to the appropriate <b  >authorized_keys2</b> file on the
remote host, e.g.,
<b  >/home/scriptboy/.ssh/authorized_keys2</b>.</p><p>CAUTION: always protect <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> private

discuss a simple feature of SSH that is especially important for
scripting: remote commands. So far we've been using the command
<b  >ssh</b> strictly for remote shell sessions. However,
this is merely its default behavior; if we invoke
<b  >ssh</b> with a command line as its last argument(s),
SSH will execute that command line rather than a shell on the
remote host.</p><p>For example, suppose I want to take a quick peek at my remote
system's log as seen in Listing 4.</p><p><a href="4413l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. Running cat on a Remote
Host</a></p><p>As shown in Listing 4, the host &ldquo;zippy&rdquo; will send back the
contents of <span   class="emphasis"><em>its</em></span>
<b  >/var/log/messages</b> file to my local console.
(Note that output has been piped to a <span   class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span>
<b  >more</b> process.)</p><p>Two caveats are in order here. (1) Running remote commands
that require subsequent user interaction is tricky and should be
avoided&mdash;with the exception of shells, <b  >ssh</b> works
best when &ldquo;triggering&rdquo; processes that don't require user input.
Also, (2) all authentication rules still apply: if you would
normally be prompted for a password or passphrase, you still will.
Therefore, if using SSH from a <b  >cron</b> job or in
other noninteractive contexts, make sure you're either using a
passphrase-less key or that the key you are using is first loaded
into <b  >ssh-agent</b>.</p><p>Before we leave the topic of SSH in scripts, I would be
remiss if I didn't mention &ldquo;rhosts&rdquo; and &ldquo;shosts&rdquo;
authentication. These are mechanisms by which access is
automatically granted to users connecting from any host specified
in any of the following files: <b  >$HOME/.rhosts,
$HOME/.shosts, /etc/hosts.equiv</b>, and
/etc/shosts.equiv.</p><p>As you might imagine, rhosts access is incredibly insecure
since it relies solely on source-IP addresses and host names, both
of which can be spoofed in various ways. Therefore, rhosts
authentication is disabled by default. shosts is different:
although it appears to behave the same as rhosts, the connecting
host's identity is verified via host-key-checking; furthermore,
only root on the connecting host may transparently connect via the
shost mechanism.</p><p>By the way, <span   class="emphasis"><em>combining</em></span> rhosts access with
RSA or DSA authentication is a very cool thing to do, especially
when using passphrase-less keys. See the <b  >sshd(8)</b>
man page for details on using rhosts and shosts with SSH, with or
without PK authentication.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x275f580.0x2b65950"></a>TCP Port-Forwarding with SSH: VPN for the
Masses!</h2></div></div><p>And now we arrive at the payoff (and the section for which I
saved room by sacrificing a more complete discussion of
rhosts/shosts): port-forwarding. <b  >ssh</b> gives us a
mechanism for executing remote logins/shells and other commands;
<b  >scp</b> adds file-copying. But what about X? POP3?
FTP proper? Fear not, SSH can secure these and most other TCP-based
services!</p><p>Forwarding X applications back to your remote console is
extremely simple. First, on the remote host edit
<b  >/etc/ssh/sshd_config</b> and set &ldquo;X11Forwarding&rdquo;
to &ldquo;yes&rdquo; (in OpenSSH version 2x, the default is &ldquo;no&rdquo;). Second,
open an <b  >ssh</b> session using the authentication
method of your choice from your local console to the remote host.
Third, run whatever X applications you wish. That's it! Needless to
say (I hope), X must be running on your local system; if it is, the
remote application will send all X output to your local X
desktop.</p><p><a href="4413l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5. Forwarding an xterm from
a Remote Host</a></p><p>After the <b  >xterm &amp;</b> command is issued, a
new xterm window will pop up on the local desktop. I could just
have easily (and can still) run Netscape, the GIMP or anything else
my local X server can handle (and which is installed on the remote
host, of course).</p><p>X11 is the only category of service that SSH is hard-coded to
automatically forward. Other services are easily forwarded using
the <b  >-L</b> flag. Consider the session shown in
Listing 6.</p><p><a href="4413l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6. Using ssh to Forward
FTP</a></p><p>The first part of the <b  >ssh</b> line looks
familiar: I'm using SSH Protocol v.2 and logging on with a
different username (mbauer) on the remote host (zippy) then locally
(mick@homebox). The <b  >-f</b> flag tells
<b  >ssh</b> to fork itself into the background after
starting the command specified by the last argument, in this case
<b  >sleep 20</b>. This means that the
<b  >ssh</b> process will sleep for 20 seconds instead of
starting a shell session.</p><p>Twenty seconds is plenty of time to start our tunneled FTP
session, which is actuated via the magic following the
<b  >-L</b> flag. <b  >-L</b> defines a &ldquo;local
forward&rdquo;: a redirection from a local TCP port on our client system
to a remote port on the server system. &ldquo;Local forwards&rdquo; follow
the syntax <b  >local_port_number</b>:
<b  >remote_hostname</b>:
<b  >remote_port_number</b> where
<b  >local_port_number</b> is an arbitrary port on your
local (client) machine, <b  >remote_hostname</b> is the
name or IP address of the server (remote) machine, and
<b  >remote_port_number</b> is the number of the port on
the remote machine you wish to forward connections to.</p><p>Note that any user may use <b  >ssh</b> to declare
local forwards on high (greater than or equal to 1024) ports, but
only root may declare them on privileged ports (less than 1024).
Staying with the above example, after <b  >ssh</b> &ldquo;goes
to sleep&rdquo; we're returned to our local shell prompt and have 20
seconds to establish an FTP connection. Note that in Listing 6 I'm
using <b  >ncftp</b>: this is because
<b  >ncftp</b> supports the <b  >-p</b> flag,
which allows me to tell it to connect to my local-forward port of
7777. Note also that I give <b  >ncftp</b> the name of my
<span   class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span> system rather than the remote host's;
<b  >ssh</b> will take care of routing the connection to
the remote host.</p><p>After 20 seconds the <b  >ssh</b> process will try
to end, but if an FTP session using the local forward is still
active, then <b  >ssh</b> will return a message to that
effect and remain alive until the forwarded connection is closed.
There's nothing to stop us from opening a login shell rather than
running a remote command (we'll just need to omit the
<b  >-f</b> flag and then use a different virtual console
or window to start FTP, etc.). If we do use <b  >-f</b>
with <b  >sleep</b>, we are not obliged to sleep for
exactly 20 seconds&mdash;the sleep-interval is unimportant (as long as
it leaves enough time to start the forwarded connection).</p><p>For that matter, you can run any remote command that will
achieve the desired pause, but it makes sense to use
<b  >sleep</b> because that's the sort of thing
<b  >sleep</b> is for. One more tip: if you use a given
local forward every time you use ssh, you can declare it in your
very own configuration file in your home directory,
<b  >$HOME/.ssh/config</b>. The syntax is similar to that
of the <b  >-L</b> flag:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LocalForward 7777 zippy.pinheads.com:21
</pre><p>In other words, after the parameter name &ldquo;LocalForward&rdquo; you
should have a space or tab, the local port number, another space,
the remote host's name or IP address, a colon but no space and the
remote port number. You can also use this parameter in
<b  >/etc/ssh/ssh_config</b> if you wish it to apply to
all <b  >ssh</b> processes run on the local machine.
</p><p>Those are some of the advanced uses of SSH and OpenSSH. For
now I must bid you adieu and refer you to the man pages for further
details and still more features. Go forth and encrypt!</p></div></div>
