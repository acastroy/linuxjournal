Is there a need for another book on Python? That was the question I
asked myself when I picked up this 800-page monster. My conclusion
is, yes, there is.
</p><p>This is one of those rare cases when the book title seems to
match the book content. I certainly consider the book a handbook,
and it is udoubtedly aimed at developers.</p><p>The book is divided into seven parts, each one of which
contains from one to five chapters. The parts are titled &ldquo;Basic
Programming&rdquo;, &ldquo;Advanced Programming&rdquo;, &ldquo;Network Programming&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Graphical Interfaces&rdquo;, &ldquo;Developing with Python&rdquo;, &ldquo;Python and
Java&rdquo; and &ldquo;Appendices&rdquo;.</p><p>Part one is 200 pages long and gets you up and going. After a
quick introduction that includes comparative information showing
how Python stacks up against C/C++, Perl, Tcl, Smalltalk and Java,
the chapters go on to cover the language itself, libraries and
exception handling. One particularly good part of this coverage is
that functions specific to particular platforms (UNIX, IRIX, Sun
OS, MS Windows and Macintosh) are broken out and covered. Even if
you only intend to develop for one platform, understanding the
specifics of all platforms is useful.</p><p>I particularly like the presentation of the material in this
part. For example, descriptions of functions include a basic
explanation and the syntax but are also generally followed by an
example. If the concept is complicated, more space is dedicated to
the example.</p><p>Part two begins where part one leaves off. It covers
&ldquo;Extending and Embedding Python&rdquo;, &ldquo;Objects Interfacing and
Distribution&rdquo;, &ldquo;Working with Databases&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other Advanced
Topics&rdquo;. &ldquo;Extending&rdquo; does an excellent job of showing you how to
integrate C code with your Python project. Again, liberal use of
examples makes everything very clear. &ldquo;Objects&rdquo; deals primarily
with COM, using examples to keep you on track.</p><p>&ldquo;Databases&rdquo; covers the use of flat files, DBM, Python's own
marshal and shelve, and SQL. This section is fairly short and
doesn't go into real detail, but choices such as PostgreSQL, Gadfly
and MySQL are introduced, and you are given URLs to find more
information. I don't consider this last part a shortcoming of the
book as database design and access could (and should) be a book of
its own.</p><p>&ldquo;Other Advanced Topics&rdquo; addresses image manipulation,
sound, regular expressions and threads. This chapter has enough
information for a serious programmer to get going but could be a
little brief for someone new to these concepts. The chapter ends
with examples that illustrate the concepts that were
presented.</p><p>Part three, with over 150 pages, has a lot of meat (tofu?).
After a basic introduction to networking that covers HTTP, FTP,
SMTP and more, you are off to web development. This chapter covers
web server configuration and then goes on to talk about
applications such as Zope and Mailman and site management tools.
The next chapter is dedicated to scripting and addresses such
issues as security, sessions and cookies. The final chapter of part
three deals with data manipulation and covers an assortment of
topics from XML to PythonPoint.</p><p>Part four consists of two chapters. The first chapter
introduces graphical interfaces including stdwin, PyKDE, PyGTK and
a lot more. The second chapter deals specifically with Tkinter and
really gets down to the nuts and bolts.</p><p>Part five takes you back from the low-level design stuff and
looks at the concepts of development. Again, there is thorough
coverage of development strategy, integrated development
environments and development and debugging tools on a variety of
platforms.</p><p>The last body part is on JPython. JPython is a new
implementation of the Python interpreter and libraries written in
Java. Coverage seems complete.</p><p>The final part includes the appendices of the book. The first
is documentation on the Python/C API. Coverage is thorough. Next is
a chapter on platform specifics. It covers Win32, MacOS, UNIX, OS/2
Windows 3.1, DOS, BeOS, VMS, Psion, Windows CE and even a clue for
anything that might have been missed. The final chapter is just the
related licenses and copyright information.</p><p>Besides covering the language, this book fills in all the
blanks. When something is difficult, examples are used to help you
out. When the subject is larger than could be covered in this
general book, references are given. All in all I found this to be
an excellent and accurate book well worth the space it will take on
a Python programmer's bookshelf.</p></div></div>
