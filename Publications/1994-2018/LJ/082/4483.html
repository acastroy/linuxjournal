<span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span> the production studio Digital Domain
used Linux on a network of more than a hundred DEC Alpha machines
to render the special effects. However, they used 350 SGI machines
running IRIX and a hundred DEC Alphas running Windows NT for the
artistic aspects of the production. Linux was judged not-ready in
1997 for the video desktop. What's developed with Linux as a
desktop operating system for video production in the last few
years?
</p><p>For Linux to be a player in the realm of television and
motion picture production it must have stunning graphics
capabilities, high-performance disk I/O with support for the very
large file sizes video needs, integration with analog and digital
video input/output devices, and the actual video applications
themselves. As these capabilities are becoming available on Linux,
the companies that develop video applications (including the
company I work for) are looking at Linux in a new way.</p><p>Because Digital Convergence seems like too much of a mouthful
for a title, and Linux Multimedia too lame, we'll call the column
Media/GFX. GFX is an abbreviation of &ldquo;graphics&rdquo; used in
television news rundowns and scripts, a term I picked up years ago
as technical director for news production at an NBC television
station. Media/GFX will tell about our travails with Linux over the
next year as we install multimedia applications and make progress
on the programming front and will discuss what it is like to
develop multimedia applications for Linux from scratch. My own area
of expertise is video software design using C++ and Java, and
that's always interesting (and frustrating) on any platform. Video
applications are always some of the most challenging because of the
demands they make on the CPU, disk and I/O systems.</p><p>Companies that develop software for their livelihood need to
be practical in the operating system they choose. It needs to be
popular, capable and not too hard to develop software for. Every
few years that platform tends to change. For example, during the
past four years my software development has been mainly on Windows
NT, with some code ported to Solaris and Alpha for servers. A major
motivation to use Windows is the vast array of relatively
inexpensive hardware available for it, including MPEG-1 and MPEG-2
video compression cards. Before my switch to WinNT it was Sparc20
Solaris with a Parallax Motion-JPEG card, and before that a simple
SGI Indigo running IRIX. If you are a video software developer it
is best not to get too attached to an operating system.</p><p>The Macintosh was perceived as the graphics platform of
choice for many years but has been eclipsed by the sheer popularity
of Windows. Windows 98 and Millennium Edition versions are the
dominant platforms for games utilizing high performance graphics.
However, stability and security concerns with DOS-based Win9x tend
to preclude its use in high-reliability broadcast scenarios. For
the same reason, Win9x is broadly prohibited for Department of
Defense users. The DoD is a major consumer of graphics systems,
usually WinNT or Solaris. Windows NT/2000 is also a major player in
video workstations. An OS design influenced by VMS (which was also
created by the same architect), WinNT/2k is more like UNIX than the
DOS-based Windows versions, even to POSIX compliance. In the
high-end, SGI with its IRIX flavor of UNIX has long dominated
motion picture production video workstations. However, WinNT/2K has
made inroads.</p><p>Earlier this year SGI announced they are moving to Linux in a
major way. The big news is graphics, the area SGI has built its
reputation upon. In collaboration with video chip manufacturer
NVIDIA, SGI Intel-based Linux workstations models 230, 330 and 550
can, according to SGI, draw over 17 million triangles per second
and up to 540 megapixels per second. Their VPro graphics subsystems
are 32MB or 64MB DDR AGP 4X boards. Perhaps like me, you're not
ready to rush out and buy an SGI workstation. You don't have to.
The graphics improvements have been made open source and rolled
into XFree86. The graphics capabilities of Linux have taken a
quantum leap forward!</p><p>Another area of video capability where SGI is making a
significant contribution is file systems. A DV IEEE-1394 Firewire
video transport stream moves at about 30MBs (typically advertised
as just 25MBs, but that's counting video only, not audio). At that
bit rate you will bump up against the 2GB file size limit in Ext2
in less than nine minutes. To contain one 22-minute television
program you need to create a 5GB file. For a 100-minute movie, make
that 23GB.</p><p>XFS is a high-performance journaled file system capable of
handling files as large as 9,000 petabytes that would hold a DV
file lasting 837 centuries. XFS has been ported from SGI IRIX to
Linux and was released in September in beta. Journaled file systems
treat disk activity as database transactions and are able to roll
back to a stable configuration if interrupted by a crash or
power-down. No fsck. XFS isn't the only high-performance Linux file
system available. Other journaled file systems (not from SGI)
include JFS, ReiserFS and Ext3FS. Journaled file systems don't have
to handle large files. In fact, Ext3FS, built upon Ext2, isn't
suitable for large video files because it inherited the same 2GB
limit.</p><p>SGI GLX is the glue code that connects the board-level OpenGL
graphics language with the X Windows System. The GLX Client Library
presents the popular OpenGL API to applications, performs indirect
rendering via X11 network protocol, and high-performance direct
rendering where the client display and server are the same machine.
The Precision Insight implementation is called the Direct Rendering
Infrastructure (DRI) and uses GLX, Mesa 3.1, XFree86 4.0 and Linux
kernel modifications. The work of porting GLX to Linux was carried
out by Precision Insight, sponsored by SGI and Red Hat.</p><p>OpenGL is a platform-independent scene description language,
implemented in the hardware of most high-performance graphics cards
and even in cheap PC cards costing less than $100 today. It is the
most widely available 3-D API (Linux, Mac, Win32 and others),
beating Microsoft Direct3D and 3dfx Glide. OpenGL enables 3-D
application programmers to get their software to work on any
hardware without writing their own drivers for every 3-D board out
there. Being a standard 3-D API of course means that OpenGL can be
used for 2-D as well.</p><p>A game designer uses OpenGL to describe what to draw as a set
of graphics primitives (shapes in space) and texture maps (images).
Having hardware handle these 3-D calculations can vastly speed up
screen rates in virtual reality interactive games such as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Quake</em></span>
(<a href="http://www.quake3arena.com" target="_self">http://www.quake3arena.com/</a>).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4483f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Screen Shot from Quake III
</p></div></div><p>SGI's reference implementation of the OpenGL API is widely
used to develop hardware drivers for their systems. Mesa, a 3-D
graphics library with a work-a-like API similar to that of OpenGL,
is the glaring exception. Mesa
(<a href="http://www.mesa3d.org" target="_self">http://www.mesa3d.org/</a>)
was developed independently to circumvent the OpenGL commercial
license. SGI has since made OpenGL, GLX and XFS open source. SGI
Open Inventor is a popular object-oriented 3-D toolkit based on a
3-D scene database, also now open source. Open Inventor is built on
top of OpenGL and supports PostScript printing. See the SGI
open-source web site at www.sgi.com/developers/oss/.</p><p>With high-performance graphics only now becoming available,
graphics applications for the Linux platform are still catching up
with their SGI IRIX and Windows NT counterparts. The GIMP, of
course, is highly regarded as a replacement for Photoshop. But, did
you know you can use GIMP to overlay graphics in Broadcast2000 [see
Adam Williams' &ldquo;Moviemaking on a Linux Box? No Way!&rdquo; in the
January 2000 issue&mdash;Editor], a Linux video nonlinear editor?
Broadcast2000 manipulates uncompressed 720x480 video captured using
a Video4Linux-compatible video card such as the inexpensive
Haupaugge WinTV or cards from Linux Media Labs. Audio is 48K stereo
sound from an OSS-compatible audio card. Starting with kernel
version 2.2, Linux supports the DV IEEE-1394 Firewire
protocol.</p><p>Many graphics programs are available for the Linux platform
in addition to the GIMP. Blender is a popular animation package to
create stunning three-dimensional graphics. Houdini was the first
major commercial 3-D animation package available on Linux. Ported
from SGI IRIX, Side Effects Software's Houdini has been used
extensively for effects animation at Digital Domain and other major
studios. It was used for effects in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Titanic</em></span>
and in <span   class="emphasis"><em>X-Men</em></span>. At $17K US, Houdini is not free,
but a 30-day evaluation version is available.</p><p>During the coming months we will investigate every Linux
multimedia-related item we can:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Video4Linux with a Haupaugge WinTV card</p></li><li><p>2-D and 3-D graphics and video programming using

All-in-Wonder)</p></li></ul></div><p>An expert with Linux might be able to cover these easily but
not with the same point of view. With almost no experience with
Linux personally (although quite a bit with Solaris and Windows) we
can expect to make some of the dumb goofs that any Linux newbie
would make. By going through this process from the start, we can
learn together.
</p><p>We are right at the start of our Linux multimedia
installation. A few days ago a new Maxtor 20GB 7200RPM hard drive
was still in the box next to my desk waiting for a fresh install of
Win98, Win2k and Debian Linux on it. We're creating a triple-boot
system because we still have our regular Windows development work
to do for our existing products. Also, it is our perhaps na&iuml;ve
plan to develop the same applications across Windows and Linux from
a single-code base. That will be some trick given the differences
between the X and Win32 GUI APIs.</p><p>Our PC contains a WinTV card for watching/capturing
television and a PyroDV IEEE-1394 Firewire card to interface with a
digital camcorder. When we get all that working right we will add
an ATI All-in-Wonder and maybe a Compaq iPAQ handheld that we want
to do some multimedia development with. (We too saw the PocketLinux
iPAQ running at the San Diego USENIX convention, very cool. See
<a href="http://www.handhelds.org" target="_self">http://www.handhelds.org/</a>.)</p><p>Linux continues to excel as a network server. The BBC uses
Linux to serve web pages, RealMedia and their digital text service.
Victoria's Secret relied on VA Linux servers to stream their Cannes
2000 Fashion Show, one of the largest live webcasts in Internet
history, more than two million viewers worldwide. With support from
SGI, NVIDIA, Red Hat, Side Effects Software and many others, Linux
is expanding beyond network servers and animation render farms into
desktop video production. Next month we'll boot our new system and
start finding out just how good the Linux is becoming as a video
desktop.</p></div></div>
