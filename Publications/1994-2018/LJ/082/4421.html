    Coding for portability to Linux: examples from the ACRT land
    vehicle port.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc3580.0xcbb660"></a></h2></div></div><p>Linux is a superset of the POSIX
(Portable Operating System Interface for X) specification. It runs
on commodity PC hardware, MIPS systems, Suns, Macintoshes and even
IBM mainframes. It's sufficiently UNIX-like that much UNIX code can
be ported over with little change.
</p><p>The Advanced Concepts Research Tool (ACRT) is a descendant of
the ARPA Reconfigurable Simulator Initiative (ARSI). It's primarily
IRIX but has NT versions for many of its modules. ACRT is a vehicle
simulator that can be reconfigured into different vehicles.
Raytheon supplies the land vehicle simulators, which currently are
the M1A1 and M1A2 tanks, M2 armored personnel carrier, M113, M577,
HMMWV and the Future Scout. Reconfigurability is done by using
&ldquo;Erector Set&rdquo;&reg; type hardware, soft panels for controls,
serial line inputs for grips and a common set of core
software.</p><p>The Erector Set hardware looks like a scaled-up version of
its namesake. This allows the crew seats, controls and monitors
that can be placed in a variety of positions to emulate the vehicle
interiors.</p><p>We use the term soft panels to refer to touch-screen
activated control panels that are used in place of the real buttons
and switches in the actual vehicles. These are designed to place
the controls as close as possible to the real vehicle. This
minimizes the amount of hardware that is vehicle-specific
(currently only grips).</p><p>Grips are either actual crew station hardware from the
vehicle or copies with simplified interior wiring. These provide
switches and analog outputs used to control some vehicle functions.
The outputs from these are converted to voltages in the range of
zero to five volts DC and fed through a BG Systems Cereal Box. The
Cereal Box acts as an analog to the digital converter and feeds
values through serial lines to the host computer. Finally, the core
set of software used by all vehicles makes it easier to develop a
new vehicle or modify existing vehicle-specific modules.</p><p>At startup, the system runs different software modules on
different hosts. These different modules include things like ground
motion (how does the vehicle move), weapons models (how does a
weapon behave, where does the round go) and control panels for the
crew to interact with. The system is kicked-off from a single host
and then starts up process managers (host_mgr) on other hosts
through the UNIX <span   class="bold"><b>rsh</b></span> command.
These host_mgr processes then parse through configuration files to
see what runs on their local host.</p><p>The system uses message passing to move information between
the different modules. Between modules on the same host, the
messages are buffered in a memory-mapped file as a form of shared
memory. Between hosts, UDP sockets are used to pass information. A
gateway system translates between Defense Interactive Simulation
(DIS) messages and the internal vehicle messages. This allows the
simulator to interact with other simulators using the DIS protocol
(see Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4421f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc3580.0xcbbb88"></a>Objectives:</h2></div></div><p>A) Demonstrate an image generator using Performer Linux
(Mongoose)</p><p>What started this project was SGI's release of its Performer
visualization/simulation tool for Linux (this version is called
&ldquo;Mongoose&rdquo;). Since our simulator's image generator (the part of
the system that draws the out-the-window and sensor views) is based
on Performer, the largest part of the work for a Linux port was
done for us. What remained was to port the code that used
Performer, the libraries and tools common to all vehicles (known as
the Tiger core), and enough of the vehicle so that it can interact
with its environment (to move, see other vehicles and utilize
special effects like weapons fire and detonation).</p><p>B) Dual-compile whenever possible to shrink codebase</p><p>To make it easier to maintain, we decided to maximize the
amount of code that would compile under either IRIX or Linux. This
shrinks the codebase to a more manageable size. The theory is that
each module would have a directory containing source code and under
it would be subdirectories for architecture-specific items
(compiled object files, libraries and executables). A Makefile in
with the source files uses the OSNAME environment variable to
bounce any <span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> commands to the
correct subdirectory depending on the architecture of the host (see
Figure 2).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4421f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2
</p></div></div><p>C) Arrange files so that machines of different architectures
use the same directories</p><p>To keep the configurations as similar as possible across
platforms, the files are arranged so that machines of different
architectures use the same directories. For distinctions that can
be made at compile time, there are different directories for
compiled libraries with which modules link and where the
executables are kept. Using environment variables for the BIN and
LIB directories that incorporate the architecture name can help
with that. For instance, on the IRIX systems, the binary directory
(stored in $ARSI_BIN) might be
<b  >/apps/projects/ACRT/bin/IRIX64</b>. On Linux
systems, it might be
<b  >/apps/projects/ACRT/bin/Linux</b>. Since the path is
stored in the same environment variable, scripts and Makefiles can
use it without regard for which type of system they are running
(see Figure 3). Environment variables are also available at runtime
to allow code to make decisions that can't be made at compile time.
By embedding environment variables in configuration files, we can
use the same configuration file for different architectures.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4421f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3
</p></div></div><p>Portability of source files was an issue for the include
files and modules that dual-compiled IRIX/NT. For IRIX to use the
files, they had to be in UNIX format (the CR/LF issue) instead of
DOS format. Fortunately, MS Studio accepts files in UNIX format, so
we settled on that. Adding Linux didn't change this equation since
Linux handles both DOS and UNIX formats. Note, however, that shell
script files must be in UNIX format.</p><p>D) Overcome incompatibilities</p><p>We first tried to use POSIX functionality. When that was not
applicable, we opted for the greatest common denominator.</p><p>E) Simplify maintenance</p><p>To keep maintenance simpler, we tried to avoid convoluted
#ifdef-ed regions of code, be careful about variables used and set
in each branch of code and verify that the flow of control was not
drastically different between branches. When possible, #ifdef-ed
code was moved to a separate file to minimize the scope of its
effect on variables.</p><p>Finally, different compilers are sensitive to different
things. A condition that goes unremarked on one compiler may cause
a warning on another. Investigate and understand your compiler's
warnings. They may lead you to an error (in which case it's easier
to fix at compile time than to track down at runtime). Warnings may
show you where intent differed from implementation. Warnings can
also hide errors. Picking out the serious message in the midst of a
page of warnings about unused variables is harder than taking out
the unused variables.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc3580.0xcbc4d0"></a>Software and Hardware Used</h2></div></div><p>This section reflects what we did in March of 2000. See the
Afterward section for more current information.</p><p>A) Red Hat 6.1</p><p>The KDE Workstation installation option provides most of the
packages you need.</p><p>B) Metrolink Motif</p><p>We experimented with Lesstif. While it works well for
Performer and lets us compile our other tools, it didn't handle
updating some of our scrolling windows correctly. The developer's
console (a tool for tracking messages) has a scrolling window that
should update with message traffic even without mouse interaction.
The Lesstif version didn't, but the Motif version did.</p><p>C) Mesa Graphics Library</p><p>We used the Mesa Graphics Library as an OpenGL look alike.
Make sure that you follow their directions for making the widget
set after you install Mesa.</p><p>D) Viper V770 Graphics Card.</p><p>We used the Diamond Viper V770 graphics card and the hardware
accelerated Mesa drivers and libraries. At that time (January 2000)
the GeForce 256 card was supported under Linux, but there were no
hardware accelerated OpenGL drivers for it. More recently, XFree86
version 4.0 is out and while hardware-accelerated OpenGL is
available for the GeForce card, setting it up can be tricky.</p><p>E) XFree86 Drivers for Hardware Acceleration</p><p>We used the XFree86 SVGA server and the
XFree86-rivaGL-3.3.3.1-49riva drivers in January. OpenGL Linux
drivers for the GeForce card are available from nVidia (see
Resources).</p><p>F) SGI's Performer Package</p><p>Downloaded and installed per their instructions (see
Resources web pages).</p><p>G) ACRT Version 1.06 (our simulator)</p><p>See Specifies for details about architecture and
operation.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc3580.0xcbcaa8"></a>Tool &ldquo;Equivalents&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p>SGIs generally offer a cushier environment than Linux.
They're also working on porting more of IRIX's tools and features
to Linux. For those accustomed to the SGI environment and new to
Linux, here are some of the corresponding tools that we used when
porting:</p><p>A) Xdiff -&gt; Mgdiff</p><p>Do a Web search for this one. My recollection is that it
requires Motif, and Lesstif won't work.</p><p>B) dbx -&gt; gdb</p><p>Your basic command-line debugger.</p><p>C) cvd -&gt; xxgdb</p><p>SGI Casevision debugger has a nice graphical interface to a
whole suite of tools. While there is no Linux equivalent for
Casevision, the xxgdb front end for dbx provides a similar
debugging environment. There is also a tool called &ldquo;DDD&rdquo; (the
data display debugger) available that we didn't use because we're
already familiar with xxgdb.</p><p>D) gr_osview -&gt; xosview</p><p>SGI's system monitoring and status tool,
<span   class="bold"><b>gr_osview</b></span>, encompasses more than
<span   class="bold"><b>xosview</b></span>, but xosview is similar in
the ability to see processor and memory status, system load,
etc.</p><p>E) editors, shells, etc.</p><p>Emacs, vi, edit, tcsh, bash and the like are all pretty much
what you'd expect (I imagine there are some differences in the dark
corners of the shells, but our system didn't use enough of them to
run into the differences).</p><p>F) xwsh -&gt; xterm</p><p>I can only say &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; here with the proviso that the
xwsh &ldquo;-hold&rdquo; option (which causes the window to persist even
after the command running in it with &ldquo;-e&rdquo; has ended) is not
available for xterm.</p><p>G) PCNFS -&gt; SAMBA</p><p>The original system shared files over NFS (requiring an
add-on package for NT). In this work we shared files between Linux
and IRIX over NFS and used SAMBA to share with the NT
systems.</p><p>H) Lint</p><p>The lint debugging tool is bundled as part of IRIX but is not
bundled with Linux, though commercial versions of lint are
available for Linux. There is also a package called LCLint that
seemed like overkill for our work (porting legacy code). For our
purposes, we used gcc and its options for better debugging and
error detection:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -ansi -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
        -Wmissing-prototypes \
        -fsyntax_only -pedantic -O2
</pre><p>Larch C Lint is available for Linux and does have better
debugging than this, if you want to go the extra mile (see
Resources).
</p><p>I) ICS' Builder Xcessory (BX PRO)</p><p>The C-code generated by the IRIX version 4 (and probably
newer versions) of ICS's BX GUI builder compiles on Linux. Code
generated by older versions needs to be tweaked. There is also a
Linux version of BX available (see Resources).</p><p>J) Virtual Prototypes' VAPS</p><p>VAPS is a control panel building tool. There is no Linux
version yet but VAPS does have an NT version. So my group ported
IRIX VAPS panels to NT, but that is a separate story.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc3580.0xcb3c80"></a>Specifics</h2></div></div><p>A) Scripts and Shell Environment</p><p>It looks like Linux (or the tcsh shell) resets the processes
limits when you &ldquo;rsh&rdquo; to another host. This kept me from getting
core files. To get around this, I added a few lines to my .tcshrc
file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
limit coredumpsize 1000000 kbytes &lt;----
source ~/environment
setenv PATH ${PATH}:.
</pre><p>The environment file referenced here is a collection of
environment variables for the simulator that is set at shell start
up. [Due to the length of Listing 1 it could not be printed here,
but is available for downloading at our FTP site:
<a href="../listings/082/" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue82</a>.]
</p><p>Using the results of uname, we can transparently point
environment variables at the architecture-specific directories for
binaries. Scripts, Makefiles and programs can then use those
environment variables without each having to check the architecture
type themselves. When we added Linux into the mix, we had to add
some additional variables:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
* $ARSI_SERIAL_PORT_ONE, $ARSI_SERIAL_PORT_TWO
</pre><p>The names of the serial port devices differ between IRIX and
Linux. IRIX <b  >/dev/ttyd[N]</b> roughly corresponds to
Linux <b  >/dev/ttyS[N-1]</b>,
<pre     class="programlisting">
* $ARSI_CTDB_FILE_SUFFIX
</pre>


the suffix of a binary data file that is different between
big-endian (SGI MIPS) and little-endian (Intel X86) systems.
</p><p>B)Makefiles</p><p>Makefiles are the part of the system that got beat up the
most with this port. The IRIX Makefiles are moved from the
directory with the source code to the IRIX64 subdirectory, and
VPATH is added to point back up to them.</p><p>VPATH (&ldquo;view path&rdquo;) in a Makefile is like the
<b  >-I</b> directives that tell the compiler where to
look for include files. VPATH tells make where to look for source
files&mdash;in our case, up one level. Another consequence of moving the
Makefiles is that you probably have to change directories before
some of the regular shell commands in Makefile (cp, lint, etc.)
that operate on the source files will work.</p><p>We recommend using SGI's
<span   class="bold"><b>smake</b></span> for the IRIX Makefiles that
need to use VPATH. We'd started using <span   class="bold"><b>GNU
Make</b></span> hoping to integrate it with NT. However MS Studio
uses <span   class="bold"><b>Nmake</b></span> instead, so that payoff
never occurred. Smake understands VPATH and the common IRIX
Makefile macros. The only anomaly we can report is one that occured
with some of the <span   class="bold"><b>clean</b></span> options. If
the <span   class="bold"><b>make clean</b></span> option is set up
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
clean:
    -rm -f *.o $(TARGET) *.a *~*
</pre><p>and <span   class="bold"><b>rm</b></span> can't find anything
to remove, smake will sometimes (incorrectly) exit with an error
about &ldquo;exit badly formed number&rdquo;. We don't know why it does that,
but adding an explicit &ldquo;exit&rdquo; statement fixes the problem:
<pre     class="programlisting">
clean:
    -rm -f *.o $(TARGET) *.a *~* ; exit 0
</pre>


IRIX has a handy feature that lets you specify an alternate make
program to run. The name of the program is put on the first line of
the Makefile following a &ldquo;#!&rdquo; (much like the way script files
name their interpreters). So making the first line of the IRIX
Makefile:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#! smake
</pre>


will cause the default make program to invoke smake to process the
Makefile.
</p><p>Dependencies are also tracked differently between IRIX
Makefiles and GNU Makefiles. The IRIX Makefiles generate a single
Make.depend file that lists all the dependencies for all the source
files. In the version of GNU make that ships with Red Hat 6.1,
dependencies are kept in separate files for each source file. For
instance, if you have a file ground_motion.c, there will be a
corresponding dependency file ground_motion.d. These can be
automatically generated with a .d.c rule. (See the GNU Make
documentation for details and how you can combine the .d extentions
into a Make.depend file.)</p><p>Compiler options are also different between the IRIX and GNU
compilers. Here's the changes we made:</p><p>For IRIX: Use GNU: Purpose: --------- --------
--------fullwarn -Wall -Extra warnings, error checks-MDupdate -MD
-Update dependencies-xansi -ansi -Support ANSI C</p><p>Using the <b  >-g</b> option with the compiler for
debugging is serious now. The IRIX debugger was still able to give
you information even if the <b  >-g</b> option wasn't
specified. For GNU, you really need to include the
<b  >-g</b>. On the Linux side, -D_BSD_SOURCE may be
needed if you're doing something that uses BSD functions (like
<span   class="bold"><b>strncasecmp</b></span>).</p><p>The permitted ordering of compiler options is different. IRIX
seems to like the libraries to be last, gcc doesn't seem to
care.</p><p>One of the handiest Makefile macros, $$(@F), is only
partially available under GNU make. Make allows you to use $(@F) to
extract the file name of a target. IRIX make and smake allow you to
use $$(@F) on the dependency line of the Makefile. GNU make allows
this only in the action clause, but it does allow you to use the
pattern-matching macros to get the same effect (compare the IRIX
and Linux Makefiles in Listings 2 and 3, which can be seen at
<a href="../listings/082/" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue82</a>).</p><p>There are some additional directories in Linux for libraries,
and they include files that may need to be added to your
Makefile:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>X libs in /usr/X11R6/lib</p></li><li><p>X headers in /usr/X11R6/include</p></li><li><p>OpenGL in /usr/include/GL, /usr/X11R6/GL</p></li></ul></div><p>Make sure that CFLAGS has <b  >-c</b> if you have
separate compile and link steps. Otherwise GNU defaults to trying
to do it in one step. If you get &ldquo;storage size not known&rdquo; error
when compiling, try removing the <b  >-ansi</b> specifier
from the command line.
</p><p>You can use the same Makefiles for IRIX and Linux, use xmkmf
to generate architecture-specific Makefiles in both IRIX and
Linux.</p><p>Let's turn our attention from Makefiles to C source code. As
a general rule, the SGI compilers are more tolerant than the GNU
compilers. Expect your code to have to be closer to the standard to
pass the GNU compilers.</p><p>The following are items we modified from the IRIX code when
porting to Linux.</p><p>1. Bstring.h, bcopy and bzero are not POSIX. We replaced them
with their POSIX counterparts:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bstring.h -&gt; string.h
bcopy(a, b, nbytes) -&gt; memcpy (b, a, nbytes)
bzero(a, nbytes) -&gt; memset(a, 0, nbytes)
</pre><p>GNU does have these in string.h instead of bstring.h, so this
is not strictly necessary (though if you don't, you'll need to
conditionally include &ldquo;bstring.h&rdquo;). Note that IRIX keeps
&ldquo;select&rdquo; in bstring.h, while Linux puts in unistd.h.
</p><p>2. Here are some things that generate warnings. Since the GNU
compiler is more vocal than the IRIX, we fixed these:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Main should return int.</p></li><li><p>Watch for uninitialized vars.</p></li><li><p>Parenthesize defensively.</p></li><li><p>Format specs in printf/scanf: args not matching var
types -scanf using the wrong type can get you in trouble</p></li><li><p>sprintf(astring, "") -&gt; astring[0] = 0;</p></li><li><p>2D array initializers need braces to be ansi -int
a[2][2] = { {1, 2}, {3, 4} };</p></li></ul></div><p>3. There is no &ldquo;recalloc&rdquo; in POSIX:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Replace recalloc with realloc and use memset to
zero out the additional memory.</p></li></ul></div>

4. Added NULL timezone as second argument to gettimeofday
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>gettimeofday is not POSIX, but SGI, Linux and NT
all accept it and timezone as the second argument.</p></li></ul></div>

5. Change sginap to POSIX usleep:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>sginap (hundredths) -&gt; usleep (hundredths *
10000).</p></li></ul></div>

6. Linux &ldquo;select&rdquo; decrements timeval structure:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The documentation for some other UNIX systems say
they may modify timeval in the future: with Linux, the future is
now</p></li><li><p>Don't use the same timeval struct on successive
calls to &ldquo;select&rdquo; without refreshing it.</p></li></ul></div>

7. Added __ANSI_C__ parseargs.h for Linux:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Parseargs was an argument parsing library last
maintained by Brad Appelton in 1991. It supports multiple platforms
and tries to figure out what's available on each system (sort of a
primitive precursor of the GNU configure utility).</p></li></ul></div>

8. Code involving the font manager (fmclient.h and variables of
type fmfonthandle) was commented out&mdash;I'm not sure if this was an
IrisGL holdover.
</p><p>9. Ulocks.h is commented out. Possibly another IrisGL hold
over?</p><p>10. Code involving sproc (SGI's lightweight process model) is
migrated to POSIX threads (pthreads):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use -D_REENTRANT on Linux compile.</p></li><li><p>Add library -Lpthread to link step.</p></li><li><p>Use XInitThreads() if threads are used in an X
application.</p></li><li><p>Get the patches for gdb from the LinuxThreads
page.</p></li><li><p>Be aware that the LinuxThreads Library uses SIGUSR1
and SIGUSR2 for its own purposes. If your application uses these
signals you might have to look at some other mechanism. In the
worst case scenario, use the Linux
<span   class="bold"><b>clone</b></span> function.</p></li></ul></div><p>11. Serial port handling used for grips and touch screens
migrates to the POSIX interface.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>See man termios for overview.</p></li></ul></div>

12. IRIX has a high-speed malloc library -lmalloc.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>No high-speed malloc lib on Linux (that I'm aware
of) so lmalloc is dropped.</p></li></ul></div>

13. Fabs, fsqrtf, fmod are not in math.h but are in the library.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Fabs is POSIX, fsqrtf is not</p></li><li><p>We suggest simply using sqrt</p></li><li><p>fmodf</p></li><li><p>use -D_BSD_SOURCE to get at M_PI, etc.</p></li></ul></div>

14. fabsf -&gt; fabs in Linux.
</p><p>15. fsin -&gt; sin in Linux.</p><p>16. fcos -&gt; cos in Linux.</p><p>17. fceil -&gt; ceil &amp; do math in double.</p><p>18. Socket level differences in your header files:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>ioctl in IRIX unistd.h, Linux has it in

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use &ldquo;struct flock&rdquo; on Linux.</p></li></ul></div>

23. Linux <span   class="bold"><b>mmap</b></span> doesn't autogrow.

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Unmatched button presses and releases on the root
window cause the window manager to hang&mdash;tip 'o the hat to John
Mellby for solving that</p></li><li><p>We chose not to use the built-in touch-screen
driver support so that we could interoperate with the IRIX systems
at that level. Once, when we integrated Future Scout with FBCB2
running on an SCO PC with no compiler, we were able to send the
SCO's display to a monitor and plug that monitor's touch-screen
into an IRIX system. The touch-screen inputs to xtouchmouse
generated X events that were sent to the SCO system allowing us to
interact with it.</p></li></ul></div>

30. Touch-screen calibration program that figures out the mapping
from touch-screen device coordinates to X coordinates is converted
from IrisGL to OpenGL.
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If you still have IrisGL code, try SGI's toogl
program to help with the conversion. You might have to convert to
Motif if you want to suppress the window borders.</p></li></ul></div>

31. Replace Iris GL window management with the X Windows System.
Here are some things that either the SGI compiler just let us get
away with or are a function of different versions of Motif:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>In order to use glwMDrawingAreaWidgetClass (instead
of glwDrawingAreaWidgetClass) you need to include a library that
defines __GLX_MOTIF to make sure the Motif libraries are included
or just use the glwDrawingAreaWidgetClass if no Motif functionality
is required. &ldquo;M&rdquo; indicates Motif and has the additional
functionality of Motif's XmPrimitive widget class.</p></li><li><p>In XtPopup, you cannot use NULL for second param.
Use XtGrabNone instead. This parameter specifies the way in which X
events should be constrained.</p></li><li><p>Use the X Toolkit Intrinsics method for setting up
a window instead of the X Lib method in order to create a
borderless window. The borderless window needs to use resources to
let the window manager know that it doesn't need to manage the
border. The resources are not accessible with the X Lib
method.</p></li><li><p>Remove IrisGL device.h.</p></li><li><p>Use -lMesaGLw instead of -lGLw for library in the
Makefile. This library has the OpenGL draw area widgets.</p></li><li><p>Note that there seems to be a bug in the current
(as of February 2000) alpha TNT2 drivers that keeps glColorMask
from working. If you're working on this now, I'd suggest switching
to the newer drivers for XFree86 version 4 and the latest
drivers.</p></li></ul></div>

32. Finally, if you do need to compile something conditionally,
there is an automatically defined symbol for #ifdef (no -D needed):
<pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef __linux__
    Linux specific stuff
#else
    IRIX specific stuff
#endif /* __linux__ */
</pre>


The bulk of the data our simulator dealt with wasn't a problem.
Much of the configuration files are ASCII and need only minor
tweaks (like environment variables) to be simultaneously usable on
IRIX, Linux and NT. In the case of Mongoose, the loaders did the
byte swapping for me, so it didn't matter if I was on a big-endian
SGI or a little-endian Intel box&mdash;the same visual models worked.
</p><p>There were a few cases where endianness became an issue. We
use the Compact Terrain Database (CTDB) files produced by the US
Army Topographic Engineering Center. The database files we used
were binary. Fortunately they came in big and little-endian
versions with different suffixes. We could tell the system which to
use by storing that suffix in an environment variable that's
evaluated at runtime. The S1000 libraries are not implemented in
Linux, just because they are larger and more complex than time
allowed. Our Spatial Database has a binary representation of the
shapes of different vehicles, so that needed to be converted.
Finally, we use the BG Systems Cereal boxes to read our crewstation
controls (grips). The Cereal box reads analog voltages from the
crewstation controls and transmits its data over a serial line to
the host computer. Since the data was assembled byte-wise into
floats a little bit of their library needed to be modified. BG
Systems was very helpful in that effort.</p><p>Once we had everything compiled, there were some surprises at
runtime. A runtime error from the GNU compiler helped us find a
case where we were accessing memory after it had been freed. IRIX
will sometimes let you access memory even after you have freed it
(see the IRIX mallopt function for different settings of their
memory allocator). There is a
<span   class="bold"><b>mallopt</b></span> function in Linux, though
the man pages don't list it. You'll have to use the GNU &ldquo;info&rdquo;
pages for that. Another feature of the GNU C library useful for
tracking memory errors is <span   class="bold"><b>mcheck.</b></span>
It's also detailed in the info pages.</p><p>The second thing is that the serial port device files have
different names between IRIX and Linux:</p><p>IRIX: Linux: ---- ------/dev/ttyd1 /dev/ttyS0 serial port
one/dev/ttyd2 /dev/ttyS1 serial port two... ...</p><p>The grip calibration programs decide based on architecture,
and look for the value of $ARSI_GRIP_CALIBRATE_PORT as an optional
override.</p><p>Was a case where the we had a different results from local
variables in a function. We had a string next to an array of longs.
The code contained an error where the string was overflowed. On the
IRIX systems, the code worked fine. On the Linux systems, it did
not. On further investigation, we found that the string was
terminating against bytes in the array of longs. In the bigendian
systems, those bytes happened to be zeros (making the system appear
to work properly), while on the little-endian systems, they were
nonzero, causing the string to appear to be corrupted. (Jim King
gets the credit for finding that one.)</p><p>Finally, there is an error in the Flight loader that comes
with Mongoose 2.3. MultiGen-Paradigm says that will be fixed in the
next release. (A tip 'o the hat to Karen Davidson for tracking that
one down.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbc3580.0x1245dd8"></a>Status</h2></div></div><p>Right now you can drive, shoot the weapons and interact with
DIS entities in Paradigm's Atlantis database (credit goes to John
Powers and Lori Shearer for helping with the CTDB files). The
system can talk to VAPS panels running on another host under
Windows NT (credit goes to Kay Chao, Kathy Jones and Vince

2000). ACRT can now use the newer High Level Architecture (HLA), a
successor to DIS. SGI is continuing to make contributions to the
world of Linux, including releasing the reference implementation of
OpenGL. A new version of Mongoose is out, and we're experimenting
with it now. By the time you read this, version 2.4 should be out,
unifying IRIX and Linux distributions. nVidia has come out with new
graphics cards and Linux drivers. The long-awaited XFree86 version
4 is out with direct rendering of OpenGL. (Prior versions took a
performance hit when they had to first render to X and then to the
screen.) Motif is now free on Linux systems.</p><p>A Linux version of the VAPS tool we used for soft panels is
due out in first quarter of 2001.</p><p><a href="4421s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
