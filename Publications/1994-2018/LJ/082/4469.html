    &ldquo;The Next Bang&rdquo; prophecy fulfilled.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd06580.0xdfe5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p> The cover story last September (Issue
77) was &ldquo;The Next Bang: The Explosive Combination of Embedded
Linux, XML and Instant Messaging&rdquo;. A story with a title like that
carries the burden of prophecy, so a follow up is obviously in
order at some point.
</p><p>As I write this, now is last November, and the buzz is still
bigger than the bang, though no less portentous. <i  >Linux Journal</i> gave Jabber&mdash;the XML-based, open-source instant
messaging system&mdash;an Editor's Choice Award in the Communications
Tool category. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Magazine</em></span> named it Best
Collaboration Tool. Tim O'Reilly talked up Jabber at the O'Reilly
Open Source Convention and has since joined the Jabber.com board of
directors. (Disclaimer: I'm on the Jabber.com advisory board, which
involves equity in the company.)</p><p>Jabber.com has partnering and other kinds of deals going with
VA Linux, Red Hat, Collab.net, Diamond Technology Partners and
other parties. The VA Linux agreement, for example, will work
Jabber instant messaging into SourceForge, as well as the Open
Source Developers Network (and its various sites).</p><p>But the first place Jabber is showing up in the embedded
&ldquo;space&rdquo; is a small one, thanks to its adoption by Transvirtual's
PocketLinux as an XML transport between handheld devices. Before
getting into that development, let's take a closer look at Jabber's
own progress.</p><p>Jabber is fundamentally about server software and is maturing
rapidly. Jabber.org has released version 1.2, which Jabber creator
Jeremie Miller calls &ldquo;a generational leap forward in server
technology and architecture&rdquo;. The big changes, he writes, are
&ldquo;component-based architecture and...pervasive flexibility and
extensibility.&rdquo; Here are some of the details:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The new architecture is very characteristic of a
typical component architecture. The core components are a client
socket manager, server socket manager, session manager, file-based
xdb (Jabber's interface to the file system and to databases such as
LDAP&mdash;Ed.) and dns resolver. Each component is loaded and managed
by the Jabber d&aelig;mon process, jabberd. Additional components
can be added easily, such as protocol transports, services, agents
and other utilities (note that these are not included in the core
server release). These components are all assembled together by a
master configuration file that acts almost like a programming
environment, enabling the administrator to assemble and structure
the components in a wide variety of ways. The new architecture is
also very networkable, allowing any component to be removed and
placed elsewhere on the network, duplicated or shared by a variety
of components. This new architecture is designed to allow the
server to be molded into a variety of environments and be used all
the way from devices to large server farms. It's important to note
that this architecture has been designed from the ground up to
support operation in a server farm, with work progressing on a
poll-based socket manager (tested up to 40,000 concurrent active
users already). Also related is work being done on a simple
name-based hashing extension to distribute load for a single domain
across multiple components or servers.</p></blockquote></div><p>He continues:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Through the component architecture, any piece of
the server can be transparently replaced by an external script or
application. The jabberd process knows how to execute components as
well as communicate to components via a tcp socket. With only a
small Perl or Python script, or a simple Java application,
additional functionality can be added to the server just about as
easily as a web server can be extended via the CGI interface. All
data access (vCard, roster, off line messages, etc.) can be handled
by any component and authentication and registration requests can
be redirected anywhere.</p></blockquote></div>

Jabber.org doesn't do clients, leaving that up to other groups.
But, the clients it supports include all of its own, plus ICQ, MSN,
AOL, Yahoo, IRC and others, through server transports written for
each. Jabber Central,
<a href="http://www.jabbercentral.com" target="_self">http://www.jabbercentral.com/</a>,
lists 14 clients, including:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>six for Windows</p></li><li><p>four for Linux</p></li><li><p>one for Newton</p></li><li><p>one for Mozilla</p></li><li><p>one for Mac</p></li><li><p>one for Java</p></li></ul></div>

SourceForge lists 48 Jabber-related projects, including clients,
development libraries, Perl modules, and bots one would expect to
grow around an open-source instant-messaging service. Most Jabber
projects are pre-1.0. According to voting at JabberCentral, Gabber
is the most popular client. It runs on GNOME.
</p><p>As of October 12, 2000, Jabber.com counted 50 active,
open-source projects, with 17 already available. Subprojects
included Palm, Java and HTTP clients, plus integration of the
Jabber server with Sun's Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE)
and Sun's iPlanet LDAP directory server.</p><p>But what makes Jabber most interesting, from an embedded
perspective, is outside the realm of what we might call
&ldquo;classical&rdquo; instant messaging. This is because Jabber may be best
conceived not just as an &ldquo;instant messaging system&rdquo; but as a very
efficient and scalable way to transport XML streams in real time.
In the words of Andre Durand, Jabber.com founder and general
manager, Jabber is &ldquo;an XML router&rdquo;.</p><p>The first company to put this aspect to use is Transvirtual
(see Doc's interview with Tony Fader and Paul Fisher of
Transvirtual in the January 2001 issue of <i  >Embedded Linux Journal</i>), which has been active in the embedded space
since it was founded in 1996. They recently developed the
PocketLinux development platform, which is designed for building
communications infrastructure for transporting and displaying XML
documents, primarily on handheld devices. Tony Fader,
Transvirtual's VP marketing, says PocketLinux is an &ldquo;end-to-end
system platform that allows you to write your applications in XML
and Java and then run them on Linux&rdquo;. It includes a small-device
implementation of the Linux kernel, plus Kaffe&mdash;Transvirtual's
open-source Java implementation.</p><p>Kaffe is &ldquo;really a superset of the Java specification&rdquo;,
Fader says. &ldquo;There are extensions to our abstract windowing
toolkit. We have an integrated frame-buffer graphics library. We
have extensions for supporting XML. We have extensions down into
Linux for implementing things like video for Linux and MP3-playing
and so forth.&rdquo;</p><p>What Transvirtual found in Jabber was a perfect way to
transport XML streams to and from small devices, especially
upcoming generations of handhelds, including PDAs and mobile
phones. The two development teams met at last August's LinuxWorld
Expo, where the Transvirtual guys were drawing mobs of attendees by
showing off PocketLinux on VTech's Helio PDA.</p><p>Says Fader, &ldquo;The Jabber guys kind of tracked us down at
LinuxWorld and requested that we investigate working together. We
were swamped, so we didn't get around to looking at their
technology until later. When we did, we found it to be a perfect
match. Their technology really meshes well with what we're doing.
There are other messaging systems, but they're not XML-based, or
they aren't designed for instant messaging per se.&rdquo;</p><p>The result is less a codevelopment effort than a vast
expansion in the scope of web development. Standard PDA
applications&mdash;calendar, address book, notes, task lists&mdash;no longer
need to care mostly about syncing up with a PC. &ldquo;The idea...is to
make the apps network-aware&rdquo;, says Transvirtual senior developer
Paul Fisher. &ldquo;We're moving to a world where you're constantly
connected. That's a good thing. If people need to reach you, they
can. If you need to reach somebody else, you can. Applications will
presume that you're already connected to the Internet. So they can
always grab or send the data they need.&rdquo;</p><p>The application would essentially be written for the Jabber
server, so fresh information (a change in the calendar, for
example) can be pushed down to PDAs, desktops and cell phones over
XML streams. The applications themselves wouldn't be locked into a
hardware platform, bypassing the familiar morass of
incompatibilities between all these devices. Communicating and
rendering XML data are about the only requirements.</p><p>At this writing, the Transvirtual and Jabber people have
collaborated on one demonstration project so far. It involves two
Compaq iPAQs equipped with 802.11 wireless LAN cards, exchanging
XML streams using Jabber as the transport.</p><p>&ldquo;It's still early&rdquo;, Fader says. &ldquo;I would like to point out
that not one medical app has been written for this framework yet,
not one logistics app, not one shipping, manufacturing or
warehousing app. The developmental paradigm here is to be able to
write an application that can be fitted to any number of different
sectors using this license-free framework, and this framework
allows for the rapid development of cross-platform applications.
It's extraordinarily compelling.&rdquo;</p><p><a href="4469s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
