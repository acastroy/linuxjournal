search engine both by and for the Linux community, now everybody
knows about Google. It doesn't hurt that Google now powers Yahoo's
Web searches as well as its own.</p><p>While Google remains a fine search engine, the company's
decision to patent its search methods hasn't sat well with those in
the Linux community who don't cotton to software patents, which
include many in the Free and Open Source Software
communities.</p><p>Well, there are also other search engines with Linux and UNIX
credentials. One is Fast Search and Transfer ASA (FAST)
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com" target="_self">http://www.alltheweb.com/</a>,
a Norwegian company with offices in the US and a partnership with
Dell. The two companies jointly and publicly intend to build the
world's largest and deepest search engine.</p><p>Early last year, Lycos made a substantial investment in FAST
and now co-brands FAST's four basic search engines: FAST Web
Search, FAST FTP Search, FAST MP3 Search and FAST MultiMedia Search
(all of which can be found at
<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com" target="_self">www.alltheweb.com</a>
and <a href="http://www.lycos.com/" target="_self">www.lycos.com/</a>&mdash;they use the same engines).</p><p>FAST's engines run on FreeBSD and are reportedly developed on
a mix of FreeBSD and Linux machines. In fact, FAST's first engine,
FTPsearch, was developed under the Free Software Foundation's GPL.
You can still download the GPL version of that software at
<a href="ftp://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/pub/ftpsearch" target="_self">ftp://ftpsearch.ntnu.no/pub/ftpsearch/</a>.
Search results are presented by Apache and PHP.</p><p>We also understand that some of FAST's people have been
involved in PHP's development for a long time, and many of FAST's
R&amp;D people in Norway come from one UNIX-oriented computer club
at the University in Trodheim. It's called
&ldquo;Programvareverkstedet&rdquo;, or PVV
<a href="http://www.pvv.org" target="_self">http://www.pvv.org/</a>.</p><p>The products FAST sells are closed-source along with the
search engine itself, which is also the case for every other search
engine at this point (or at least that we know of&mdash;correct us if
we're wrong).</p><p>For more about FAST's technologies, click the &ldquo;Technology&rdquo;
tab on the company's home page.</p><p>In another significant search engine development, Yahoo began
in November to charge businesses to hurry their listings into
Yahoo's &ldquo;Business to Business&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shopping and Services&rdquo;
areas within the &ldquo;Business and Economy&rdquo; category. For $199,
Yahoo's Business Express program fast-tracks submissions for review
and possible inclusion in Yahoo's listings in either of those two
areas. According to the FAQ
<a href="http://docs.yahoo.com/info/suggest/faq.html" target="_self">docs.yahoo.com/info/suggest/faq.html</a>,
&ldquo;...any site submitted to these areas will be reviewed and either
added or denied within seven business days. If your site is denied,
you will be told why and will have a chance to appeal the
decision.&rdquo;</p><p>Meanwhile, the Open Directory Project
(<a href="http://www.dmoz.org" target="_self">http://www.dmoz.org/</a>)
continues to grow at an explosive rate. A cursory set of searches
shows the two services are highly competitive. The question now is,
how do they scale?</p><p>There's not much you can do to help Yahoo other than work for
the company or pay for a listing. But there's a lot you can do to
help the Open Directory Project&mdash;mainly as an editor. Just navigate
down to a topic that obsesses you and sign up to become an editor

(<a href="http://www.omahasteaks.com" target="_self">http://www/omahasteaks.com/</a>)
believed would be the start of their busiest on-line shopping time
of year, the 2000 holiday season, they decided to revamp their web
site to accommodate an estimated one million customers. eOne Group
(<a href="http://www.eonegroup.com" target="_self">http://www.eonegroup.com/</a>),
an Omaha-based eCommerce software and service provider, worked with
Omaha Steak's internal IT department to build a web site that could
be hosted on-site, integrated into back-end systems as well as
provide advance delivery schedules and multiple ship-to-address
options.</p><p>As the basis of the new web site, eOne used their Java-based,
hardware-independent development application called jCommerce.
Being an open-architecture application, jCommerce runs on almost
any platform and can be customized for each individual customer and
situation. As jCommerce provided the database-driven features Omaha
Steaks wanted, including easily customized XML and XHTML tags and
accessible userinterfaces, the software choice seemed easy enough;
the real decision centered on what platform to use.</p><p>Chad Bukowski, chief architect at eOne, characterizes Omaha
Steaks as a traditional, family-owned and operated business since
1917. He was unsure how receptive the company would be of the
open-source philosophy and business model Linux offered, the
platform eOne actively supports for their jCommerce software. But
he also knew that their final decision would be based on price and
performance and not necessarily the name attached to the platform.
The benchmark stress and load tests were done on RS/6000 M80 IBM
systems, their current AS/400 system and Dell Intel boxes running
Red Hat Linux 6.2. During the test, the AS/400 system slowed when
the number of separate, simultaneous customer orders headed toward
50; the RS/6000 topped out around 150-200 orders. The Dell boxes,
according to Bukowski, processed 250-400 orders with little
taxation.</p><p>Impressed by the benchmark results of Linux, its scalability
and because Omaha Steaks &ldquo;wanted something that wasn't tied to
IBM&rdquo;, Bukowski said that they were eager to launch their new web
site running on Linux. Jeff Carter, CTO of Omaha Steaks, said that
four main considerations made Linux the most viable option: price
performance of the Dell servers versus the IBM offerings ($8,000
per machine for Dell vs. $250,000 per machine for RS/6000, plus
licensing fees); overall acceptance and performance of Linux in the
Internet space; stability of Linux versus NT on the Intel platform;
and easy integration of Linux with legacy systems.</p><p>The new site went live in fall 2000, after a 60-day setup
period. So far, both Omaha Steaks and eOne are pleased with the
results. Reboots are nonexistent, and Bukowski says the system &ldquo;is
singing right along&rdquo;. Customers are satisfied with the simplified
and versatile ordering procedure, and Omaha Steak employees have
had no problems adapting to the new system. Carter underlines the
importance of having a system that can be maintained with internal
resources: no Java programming is necessary to maintain the
parameter-driven site. Of Omaha Steak's relationship with eOne
Group, jCommerce and Linux, Carter says, &ldquo;No one else in the
marketplace had all of these thing to offer.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235a580.0x284c7f8"></a>Apache Extends the Plateau</h2></div></div><p>Netcraft's monthly survey
(<a href="http://www.netcraft.com" target="_self">www.netcraft.com</a>)
of hosts providing HTTP service has told the story of Apache's
long-running leadership ever since the survey began in mid-1995
when Apache weighed in with a share of just a few percents. Late
that year, Apache, NCSA and &ldquo;other&rdquo; were all tied at around 30%.
This was also when Microsoft's IIS came on the scene. Since then
Apache and IIS have gained and held the leading two positions, with
Apache taking the majority share by a wide margin. While IIS
overtook &ldquo;other&rdquo; to assume second place in December 1997, with
about 20% of all sites surveyed, Apache was already moving past a
50% share.</p><p>The story told since late 1998 has been a pretty stable one.
Apache holds a strong 59.67% (down from 60.02%). Microsoft is up
from 19.56% to 20.17%. Sun's iPlanet (which includes all the old
Netscape servers) is down from 7.15% to 6.92%. But those are just
shares of a total that is up for all three. Here are the
gains:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Apache: up 590,305&mdash;from 12,705,194 to 13,295,499</p></li><li><p>Microsoft: up 352,960&mdash;from 4,140,977 to 4,493,937</p></li><li><p>iPlanet: up 27,169&mdash;from 1,514,106 to 1,541,275</p></li></ul></div><p>The rising tide lifts even the most competitive boats.
</p><p>The most interesting news coming out of Netcraft's latest
survey concerns uptime. &ldquo;Hosting locations with at least five
popular sites queried several times each week are reported in order
of average uptime, and a league table of the fifty sites with the
highest uptimes on the Internet is also maintained&rdquo;, Netcraft
reports. The resulting graphs are pretty interesting. We see that
Slashdot was rebooting almost daily going into late 1999 when
uptime began to move past 60 days. One server has been up since May
of this year (we're writing in November). Slashdot right now has a
very respectable maximum uptime of almost 190 days and a 90-day
moving average of over 120 days. Netcraft reports that Slashdot is
running &ldquo;Apache/1.3.12 (UNIX) mod_perl/1.24 on Linux&rdquo;. By
contrast, Microsoft has a max of 75.22 days and a 90-day moving
average of 18.76, running &ldquo;Microsoft-IIS/5.0 on Windows 2000&rdquo;. To
be fair, however, we can point to Starbucks, which now is past 215
days of uptime since moving to Windows 2000. This is also &ldquo;the
longest uptime of any Windows 2000 site we've seen on the
Internet&rdquo;. The overall record-holder is www.charite.de, which has
been up 836.49 days or more than 2.5 years. It's running
&ldquo;Netscape-Commerce/1.1 on IRIX&rdquo;.</p><p>By far the largest hosting site is Exodus Communications,
which has 548 sites at just one &ldquo;netblock&rdquo; in Santa Clara,
California. The four longest-running servers are all for Zope and
all run Linux. They're averaging an uptime of 384 days, which also
happens to be the entire measured period. Three run
&ldquo;Zope/(unreleased version) ZServer/1.1b1&rdquo;. The other runs
&ldquo;Apache/1.3.4 (UNIX)&rdquo;. Also on the Exodus list are smellygig.com
(Apache on Solaris, 277 days), cluetrain.com (Apache on Solaris,
258 days), mysql.com (Apache on Linux, 183 days), whitehouse.com
(yes, the XXX site, Apache on BSD, 162 days) and slashcode.com
(Apache on Linux, 190 days).</p><p>Another interesting Netcraft observation concerns &ldquo;how good
the vendors are at running their own kit&rdquo;. Among the list of
hosting locations with the longest uptimes, VA Linux is in sixth
place. Sun is at ninth. Microsoft is at 25th.</p><p>Netcraft's latest survey information is available at

<a href="http://www.searchrequests.weblogs.com" target="_self">http://www.searchrequests.weblogs.com/</a>)
is a &ldquo;collaborative weblog dedicated to misleading search
requests&rdquo; that mines the veins of irony found in both site
referrer logs and search-engine results derived from link-loving
bots and engine algorithms that give maximum value to the most
highly linked sites. So, DSR continues,</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>If you write a weblog on a regular basis, chances
are you're going to post quotes from other sites, opinions from
other people, etc. But since weblogs are highly linked to and from,
they get indexed very well by search engines. So, even if you only
once wrote about your hamster, and on the same day mentioned you
were wearing a three-piece suit, Google just might list you as No.
1 for &ldquo;hamster suit&rdquo;. Now just imagine that you check your
referrer logs and you find a query from a search engine, looking
for &ldquo;hamster suit&rdquo;. This is where this site kicks in.</p></blockquote></div><p>For example, Dave Bug of Geeklife (http://www.geeklife.com/)
found that &ldquo;Where are all the nice girls?&rdquo; was not only a search
request in his log files, but brought up The Value of Psychotic
Experience
(<a href="http://deoxy.org/w_value.htm" target="_self">deoxy.org/w_value.htm</a>)
as a result on Google.
</p><p>At this writing (November 20), there seems to be agreement
among threads both within and linked to DSR, that Google and Yahoo
(which uses the Google engine) sometimes exclude DSR from its
findings. So we just typed &ldquo;Disturbing Search Results&rdquo; into
Google, punched the &ldquo;I'm feeling lucky&rdquo; button and went straight
to the site. Guess this isn't one of those times.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235a580.0x284d140"></a>A New Linux Site for the Spanish-Speaking Linux

wireless and telecommunications companies were concentrated. In the
midst of the Internet Appliance pavilion was a booth for Be, Inc.,
the operating system company that has recently retooled itself to
go after the Internet appliance business. While Be was making a
valiant effort, the big news was quietly evident in other booths
all around the floor, where Linux had quietly soaked into
everything.</p><p>A company called Internet Appliance showed racks of servers
featuring advanced failover technologies, dynamic content
screening, browser-based setup and administration and other goodies
one would hope to find in &ldquo;a complete Data Center for less than
$30,000&rdquo;. Does it run on Linux? Yes. Is that fact a big deal?
No.</p><p>While Be hustled for every bit of visibility it could muster,
Linux was quietly demonstrating its new default status as commodity
OS infrastructure. Here are just a few of the Linux-powered devices
I encountered at the show:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Sony VAIO C1 PictureBook notebook computer (running

(also with a Transmeta Crusoe), which won &ldquo;Best Consumer Product&rdquo;
from ZDNet and CNet judges</p></li></ul></div><p>When I spoke with these companies in their booths, most
didn't even give me reasons why they built their boxes with Linux.
It was as if I asked why they used a TCP/IP stack or plastic in
their cases.
</p><p>Embedded Linux has become viral. Even when it isn't the
subject at hand, the fact of Linux's rapid spread into embedded
devices still comes up. While I was talking with a couple of guys
at the Micronas booth (Micronas is a German company whose
multimedia chips are in pretty much everything), they told me about
a company called NetGem that makes Linux-based appliances that use
televisions as monitors&mdash;very big in Europe, they report.</p><p>No doubt Be has a lot to offer. But it has to be sold. At
this point, embedding Linux isn't even much of a brainer anymore.
At some point in recent history, the question shifted from &ldquo;why&rdquo;
to &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; Clearly there are fewer reasons every day.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235a580.0x284dfb0"></a>They Said It</h2></div></div><p>The seven worst words in cyberspace are &ldquo;You just don't get

<span   class="bold"><b>rinetd</b></span> on the IP Masquerding box
available at

(Also available as a package; check your distribution's web
site.)</p><p>If you let other people run Perl scripts on your machine,
make a symlink from /usr/local/bin/perl to the real location of
Perl so they don't complain, &ldquo;Hey, you don't have Perl.&rdquo;</p><p>Another thing that shouldn't make any difference but
sometimes fixes weird problems: switch PCI cards around in their
slots.</p><p>If you have a complicated
<span   class="bold"><b>crontab</b></span>, do a <b  >crontab -l

mark. For example, with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
( some text [ some more stuff
another line

} )
</pre><p>If you position the vi cursor on any of the marks, in command
mode the % will move the cursor to the matching mark.
</p><p>You can use this method in comments in a programming or
scripting language to allow quick fast-forward and fast-backward
over large blocks of code, as well as use it to find boundaries of
functions in languages like C which use one of these marks to
delimit functions.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235a580.0x2760b20"></a>Mapping</h2></div></div><p>Map an unused key to change files in vi. For example, if your
.exrc or .vimrc has <b  >map , :e#^M</b> when you've
edited two files, for example, by giving</p><pre     class="programlisting">
vi file1 file2&lt;Enter&gt;
:n&lt;Enter&gt;
</pre><p>so that you're in file2 and in command mode, typing
<b  >,</b> (no Enter required) will switch you back to
file1. Use it again, and you switch to file2 and so on.

the election results, even before the election, have affected job
figures. While the number of jobs offered has fallen since April,
the decline has leveled off. Chart #1 shows the normalized job
trends over the last 11 months. Ordinarily, things that don't
change are not very interesting. But in this case, the fact that
things have leveled off is good news.</p><p>(Note: Chart #1 is normalized for the number of jobs in
January of this year. That is, the number of openings in January
2000 has been taken as 1.00.)</p><p><a href="4451f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure #1</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x235a580.0x2760ff0"></a>Platform Demand</h2></div></div><p>Over the last 18 months, a number of platforms have competed
for dominance. One of the interesting aspects of this is how fast
demand for the main platforms has been growing or shrinking. Demand
is defined as the rate of acceleration/deceleration in the trend
line for the period shown. From Chart #2, we can see that demand
has been slowing for the older platforms, while the newer ones,
like Windows 2000 and Linux, have accelerated faster than all
others.</p><p><a href="4451f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure #2</a></p><p>Again, the exception to the rule is Solaris. It is right up
there with the newbies. This indicates that Sun is increasing its
dominance of its markets. These demand lines are positive at the
moment because of the long period of expansion. Over the last 30
days, demand for all platforms has followed the general trend and
decelerated. However, the short term has not yet outweighed the
long-term demand.</p></div></div>
