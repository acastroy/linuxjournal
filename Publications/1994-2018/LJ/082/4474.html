and the ugly specrte of a Linux registry. But we have to live with
Microsoft (at least for the near term) for other incompatibilities
as well. One of those is in printing. The Microsoft way is for
every client to know everything about the printer it will be using,
instead of the print server, which, under Microsoft, only queues
jobs to the printer but doesn't format them. So what happens if you
have to change out the printer (or upgrade to a newer one)? Well,
you have to track down those several hundred clients and change
each one individually. Linux allows you to do this silliness, if
you really want to, with raw printers (no print filter usage). But
you don't have to. If all Linux boxes that are print servers do the
document formatting from generic postscript files, printing becomes
a no-brainer. Just tell Word Perfect, et. al., to use a passthrough
postscript driver. Windows systems can use the Apple 1200
postscript driver. Now you can print to any printer in the
UNIX/Linux world, to fax machines and even send postscript files to
friends to read and print (or turn into PDF files). No need to
juggle 600+ printer drivers for all the world's printers on every
client. Simplicity beats Microsoft because who needs more
headaches?
</p><p>pam_watch:
<a href="http://frida.fri.utc.sk/~behan/devel/pam_watch" target="_self">http://frida.fri.utc.sk/~behan/devel/pam_watch/</a></p><p>Do you need to snoop on terminals? Perhaps show someone from
afar how to accomplish a particular task? This utility will allow
two users to watch and use the same terminal at one time, even
continents apart. When used as a login session, pam_watch creates
two pipes, one for input and one for output, that someone (usually
root) can attach to. The only downside is that it won't work on
ptys (used in X sessions and ssh sessions) or sessions spawned from
the terminal. Requires: libpam, libdl, glibc.</p><p>multiscan:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/multiscan" target="_self">http://sourceforge.net/projects/multiscan/</a></p><p>I think we all know that nmap is good. But it's not fast, and
it's a little heavy. If you need a quick scan of your own network
to see which ports are open on which systems, and you need it
yesterday, multiscan will tell you. I watched it rip through a
Class C private network in no time. Granted, unreachable hosts
slowed it down a lot, but reachable hosts showed all open ports at
a pace of two hosts per second. That's fast. Requires:
glibc.</p><p>phpopenmonitor:
<a href="http://www.edomex.net/phpopenmonitor" target="_self">http://www.edomex.net/phpopenmonitor/</a></p><p>Do you need to be able to check a number of systems for open
ports (running services) often and quickly? This utility won't take
the place of nmap&mdash;you can't search for open ports. But if you list
ports you want to be sure are open (or closed) and enter those next
to the host name, you can see at a glance if all is well. It's
quick and easy to set up and autorefreshes every five minutes (feel
free to change that). Requires: web server, php4, web browser
(capable of color output).</p><p>SQL-Ledger:
<a href="http://www.sql-ledger.com" target="_self">http://www.sql-ledger.com/</a></p><p>After looking at this particular application, all I can say
is Wow! Someone was reading my mind (now that's a scary thought).
Take a PostgreSQL server, a little Perl, mix in a web server and
all the ingredients for a good accounting program, and you have:
SQL-Ledger. Okay, so I haven't checked to see if it's compliant
with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures), and it's been
years since my last accounting class, but this is good. It still
lacks a few details, like POS (point-of-sale), but they're on the
to-do list. With a program like this, who needs Quick Books?
Requires: PostgreSQL, web server, Perl and Perl modules: DBD-Pg,
DBI.</p><p>CCC:
<a href="http://www.noguska.com/ccc" target="_self">http://www.noguska.com/ccc/</a></p><p>CCC is not a general accounting program (although it could be
used as one with some modifications); it does an excellent job of
quantifying work for a computer maintenance shop. You can track
jobs, technicians and systems. You can use the information to bill
clients. If you need a simple job tracking/invoicing system, this
could be what you need. Requires: MySQL, web server with PHP and
MySQL support, web browser.</p><p>tvguide:
<a href="http://www.cherrynebula.net/tvguide.html" target="_self">www.cherrynebula.net/tvguide.html</a></p><p>Sound and video aren't usually my thing. Okay, so when I'm
working on something I might listen to a little Pink
Floyd&mdash;&ldquo;Comfortably Numb&rdquo; is good music to concentrate on a
problem with. But I do like to keep an eye on the news, or
whatever, something to do while a build (or two) is in progress.
With tvguide, I can grab what's on the site quickly, grep it (or
just read it) and tune in something interesting on my TV card.
Might be a waste of good cycles, but they're often idle anyway. At
least I don't miss as many football games. Requires: Perl.</p><p>pkgbuild:
<a href="http://www.linuxsupportline.com/~davin" target="_self">http://www.linuxsupportline.com/~davin/</a></p><p>If you need to build RPM packages, this little GUI tool can
help you. While you still have to know how to build one, this
utility makes a good aid. I will warn you that some particular
incantations within the spec files are rejected. But if you start
with a good template (that pkgbuild likes) you can go easily from
there. This tool will not make you an RPM wizard, but it will force
you to relook at how you structure your spec files (if you consider
that a plus). Requires: libm, libSM, libICE, libXext, libX11,
glibc.</p><p>sniffer:
<a href="http://stev.org" target="_self">http://stev.org/</a></p><p>This utility will show you a great deal about what's
happening on on your network in terms of the bandwidth you're
consuming per minute, etc. You can see stats of TCP, UDP, ARP and
other packets. You can switch between different displays. While
only root can run it (unless you permit users to open raw sockets),
it is a very handy tool. You can also see MAC addresses and a good
guess of the Ethernet card brand. Requires: libpthread, libncurses,
glibc.</p><p>Until next month.</p></div></div>
