century!) you are the squad commander of an elite assault force of
huge humanoid battlefield vehicles called &ldquo;Gears&rdquo;. Using
carefully planned tactics and sophisticated futuristic weaponry,
you lead your squadron through an engaging story line directed
against your people's arch nemesis, Earth.</p><p>It's a step in the right direction if the direction you want
to go is away from the same old boring first-person shooters.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear II</em></span> is addictive, with a nice sci-fi
story line, good multiplayer capability, enough single-player modes
to keep you interested for days and game play that allows extremely
fine control of your in-game combat experience but retains a strong
arcade feeling. It features stunning graphics with picturesque
landscapes (and spacescapes) and excellent accompanying audio.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear II</em></span> isn't perfect; extended game
play will begin to expose interesting quirks that tend to become
irritating at times, and there are some technical issues that could
probably have been handled better (and some that apparently have
yet to be resolved). Overall, however, this game's fun factor seems
to win out in the end, and the game has little difficulty consuming
one's evening hours and free time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a5580.0x259dce8"></a>The Story</h2></div></div><p>Developed around the Dream Pod 9 game system of the same
name, <span   class="emphasis"><em>HG2</em></span> is Activision's follow-up to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear</em></span>, and its story line picks back up
about two decades after the end of the the first
<span   class="emphasis"><em>HG</em></span>. To summarize, an interpolar war on your
home planet, Terra Nova, (a former Earth colony but now
independent) has come to a halt in the face of an explosive and
cataclysmic event that appears to herald the return of invasion
forces from Terra Nova's former arch-enemy: Earth. The governments
of both poles of your planet have agreed to cease hostilities
toward each other in order to confront this age-old enemy. As their
first step toward the defense of your world they have formed of an
elite fighting unit, composed of the best Gear pilots on the
planet. You, of course, being the cream of the crop, white-hot ball
of Gear-piloting fighting prowess that you are, have been chosen as
the team's squad commander. Your mission, basically, is to take
your team of combat specialists behind enemy lines to discover what
attack plans Earth has in mind for your world and determine their
tactical strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>What does this all mean to you as a player? Although the
story line is relatively simple, it tends to grow on you as it
progresses and, unlike many first-person shooter story lines, seems
to add quite a bit to the overall feel of the game play. Moreover,
the various dialogs and briefings direct your strategy toward
different goals as the story line progresses. This gives you a nice
change from the seemingly endless begin/fight/kill/end cycles of so
many other first-person games. Based on where you are in the story,
you'll have to use different tactics to succeed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a5580.0x259df50"></a>Overview</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear II</em></span> has been plagued since its
release by comparisons to its competition, <span   class="emphasis"><em>MechWarrior
3</em></span>. Though based on similar themes, these games are
actually quite different. Gears are physically different from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>MechWarrior</em></span>'s robots, and the game play style
of the two games varies accordingly. With a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mech</em></span>, you are a walking battleship, a massive
hulking behemoth, with more firepower than a division of M1 A1
Abrams tanks, and could probably find camouflage in a futuristic
skyline&mdash;as a building. Gears, on the other hand, while still large
and extremely powerful, are typically a fraction of the size, the
largest being only about 15 feet tall. With a Gear, one must use
tactics and wits to a much greater degree than with its larger
cousins. Gears are small enough to be sneaky and to use stealth as
a valid tactic. In fact, their smaller stature also means, unlike
their 20-story counterparts, they cannot stand in battle and just
take the abuse given. Therefore, hiding, setting up ambushes and
the like are widely used and often mandatory since you'll be sorely
outnumbered from time to time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a5580.0x259e1b8"></a>Game Play</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear II</em></span> isn't simple. This isn't
something you can install from your CD and immediately jump into
action. <span   class="emphasis"><em>HG2</em></span> seems nearly flight simulator-like
in complexity when one first sits down to it. In fact, to become
thoroughly acquainted with all the controls and modes of game play
requires a full seven-course meal of rather involved training
missions and should probably include the convenient placement of
the included keyboard-shortcut command placard just to keep track
of the myriad commands used in the game. The payoff, however, is
extraordinary; the level of control a player has in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>HG2</em></span> is amazing. For instance, even general
movement consists of several axes of control, as one must
coordinate the separate movements of the upper torso of your Gear
to work in concert with the lower portion of your body. In turn,
your lower body has several modes of operation, including jump
jets, walking, kneeling, crawling and even, in Gearspeak, an SDS or
&ldquo;Secondary Movement System&rdquo;, which deploys what amount to
all-terrain rollerblades from the soles of your Gear's feet to
allow you to, quite literally, skate into battle (or away from it)
at high speed. Radar modes allow one to scan actively for nearby
enemies, increasing the likelihood that they will be able to detect
your Gear's presence. Or, you can enhance your Gear's stealth by
switching to a passive-only mode. Your Gear is equipped with
maneuvering thrusters for control in the weightlessness of space,
and the act of accurately space-maneuvering a Gear in all its
possible axes of motion while in a combat situation seems as
difficult as neurosurgery the first few times at bat.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4456f2.large.jpg"><img src="4456f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. <span  class="emphasis"><em>HG2</em></span>'s Gear Lab Boasts More
Customization Options Than You Can Shake a Vibroaxe at.
</p></div></div><p>The amount of customization possible in the game is
unparalleled. Since you're fighting for two wealthy governments,
your budget isn't really limited; you can have anything you want
and as much of it as you can carry. The list of possible Gear
models is seemingly unending (by my count about 70 primary models)
and divided into four main categories: Light, Medium, Heavy (of
course) and Assault. There are typically several base
configurations for each primary model, and the Gear lab has the
functionality to create and save your own custom configurations as
often as you like. As for guns 'n ammo to attach to your Gear,
again, the list is truly huge; just the <span   class="emphasis"><em>names</em></span>
of weapons in the vast array at your disposal take a few minutes to
read and a detailed study to understand fully. To create some
modicum of balance in the game, a system of &ldquo;threat levels&rdquo; has
been implemented. Missions have a maximum total threat level that
the entire team can have, as well as the maximum total threat level
for any single Gear in the team, and you are forced to configure
the weapons and equipment of each Gear on the mission so that
neither of these limits are exceeded. Added to the mix is a complex
system of &ldquo;Perks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Flaws&rdquo; that can be assigned to alter the
threat profile of each Gear (Perks increase the threat score, Flaws
decrease it) and make it truly unique on the battlefield. If you're
into this sort of highly detailed customization, you won't be
disappointed.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4456f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear</em></span> Missiles
</p></div></div><p>So, does all of this preplanning and detailed control pay off
in superior game play? Well, kind of: it's enough fun to keep you
up all night. However, it also has some problems. Activision
redesigned the entire game engine for <span   class="emphasis"><em>HG2</em></span> (the
so-called &ldquo;Dark Side&rdquo; engine) and, though it's very nice at
times, it seems less robust and has poorer effects than some of its
non-Linux-ported competition. The scenery is completely
indestructible, allowing no cratering or deformation of any kind
except for the exact targets that <span   class="emphasis"><em>HG2</em></span>'s
programmers thought you should be blowing up (which are typically
only the handful of final goal targets, not just any ol' tree or
rock along the route). There is also some curious clipping issues
with the engine that can cause your Gear to, at times, slide right
though mountains, rocks and even walls as though they don't exist.
The AI is basically pathetic; although you have a great deal of
control of your teammates through the relatively simple
team-control commands, these guys are often as brain-dead as hockey
pucks. On several occasions, squadmates become stuck in various
landscape features, and I once had to destroy an entire base's
defenses just to get to a single enemy Gear who was stuck against a
wall, trying to go through it to get to me. The landscapes,
although a bit dark, are quite spectacular at times, but the
clipping distance is too short and, without the fogging effects
activated, you can often clearly see the edge of the world dropping
off on the horizon or appearing abruptly in the distance as you
walk along. Again, these issues, while unsightly, aren't really
enough to ruin the fun of the game, but they seem to leave a bad
aftertaste at times.</p><p>There are several modes of game play available in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear II</em></span>. The campaign mode is very cool,
the missions are short enough to keep you glued to the action, and
the story line is compelling and unfolds in briefings and creative
cut scenes that use the game engine to draw the action. Also
available is a &ldquo;Historical&rdquo; mission section, which lets you
relive and refight some of the greatest battles in Terra Novan
history. For those of you who simply want basic combat, and want it
right now, there is an &ldquo;Instant Action&rdquo; mode of play available
that does just what it should; it puts you in the thick of your
choice of a wide variety of highly customizable combat situations.
There are several missions in the single-player training mode
(which this reviewer highly recommends) and, last but not least,
the multiplayer mode. <span   class="emphasis"><em>HG2</em></span>'s multiplayer mode
includes several types of game play: a one-on-one duel-type game;
the traditional multiplayer &ldquo;death match&rdquo; free-for-all; a &ldquo;steal
the beacon&rdquo; game where players accumulate points for the length of
time they are able to hold onto the &ldquo;beacon&rdquo; before someone blows
them to bits; a &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; variant where players form teams and
attempt to destroy their opponents' bases; and, lastly, the classic
&ldquo;capture the flag&rdquo;. Unfortunately, there are no cooperative
multiplayer campaign-style modes in <span   class="emphasis"><em>HG2</em></span>. I
think this would have added a great deal of fun to the game.
However, I've heard that the historical missions were originally
intended to be cooperative, but a scarcity of in-game resources
forced the game designers to abandon the idea and make them
single-player instead.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4456f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a5580.0x259ecb8"></a>Linux Issues</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear II</em></span> was originally written in
the Direct3D API (from that company in Redmond). It was the first
Direct3D game to be ported to OpenGL for Linux and, as such, is a
terrific accomplishment by Loki. For my money, they did a great
job. Unfortunately, there are issues with the game that are, by and
large, not really Loki's fault. This game has many of the same
problems in every platform. On my G400-based VA Linux box, things
worked fine, though I did experience some of the interesting
clipping issues mentioned earlier. However, the closed-source
drivers on my NVidia GeForce GTS-based Debian system went belly-up
every time I went from 3-D mode back to the 2-D menus and
debriefings, which made it impossible to use the single-player
campaign modes at all on that machine. Loki's support gave me some
interesting suggestions and patches to try to alleviate this
problem, but none were successful in the end. I've since heard that
this is a known issue with the NVidia cards and this particular
game.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24a5580.0x25956a8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear II</em></span> is a great game, and it's
highly addictive once you get past the steep initial learning
curve. The story isn't just a few cut scenes used to break up the
action; it's fun to watch unfold and holds your interest. The
overall feel of the game is fast-paced and fun, nearly arcadelike
at times; however, the game play problems are hard to ignore. I
can't help but feel as though this game was picked from the vine a
bit before it had ripened fully. That said, I'd certainly recommend
giving <span   class="emphasis"><em>Heavy Gear II</em></span> a try, especially if,
like me, you really enjoy simulator-style games with some strategy
and tactics required. However, if you want a simple and
easy-to-learn first-person shooter, you should probably pass on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>HG2</em></span>.</p><p><a href="4456s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
