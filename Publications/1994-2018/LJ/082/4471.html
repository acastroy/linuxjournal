    Corbic and Mandelstam discuss the structure and user interfaces
    to the WANPIPE drivers as they have evolved and currently exist.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b9a710"></a></h2></div></div><p>From the start, Linux has been the
operating system of choice for network appliances&mdash;devices that
provide services such as network address translation (NAT),
firewalling, virtual private networks (VPN), mail services and web
caching. It was therefore a natural requirement, from the earliest
days, that Linux provide internal support for wide area network
(WAN) connectivity.
</p><p>In 1994, Sangoma began developing its WANPIPE code and
utilities for Linux to supplement drivers that had been written by
third parties to support Sangoma WAN cards.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b9a870"></a>Intelligent Adapters</h2></div></div><p>WANPIPE supports the Sangoma S series. Included in this
series are cards such as the S514 PCI and S508 ISA&mdash;intelligent
adapters that support most WAN protocols in firmware, including
Frame Relay, PPP, HDLC, X25 and BiSync.</p><p>Because protocols are supported in firmware, design of the
device driver is much simpler. It is easier to port to a new
operating system as there are fewer chances of failure and CPU load
is kept to a minimum. These characteristics enable a relatively
slow machine like a 486 to use a Sangoma adapter and Linux to
create a powerful T1 router.</p><p>With protocols isolated on the board, it is possible to test
and certify the protocol implementations of one operating system
and know that they will work identically on any other operating
system. If necessary, a protocol update can be installed on the
fly, without recompiling the driver or the kernel.</p><p>Sangoma adapters can have two different physical interfaces,
T1 (CSU/DSU on board) or serial V.35/X.21/EIA530/RS232. The card
with the T1 interface allows the server to connect directly to the
T1 line without an external CSU/DSU.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b9aa80"></a>WANPIPE Device Drivers</h2></div></div><p>Sangoma S514 and S508 cards support up to four high-speed
sync lines, each carrying a multichannel WAN protocol. The driver
architecture was based on the following requirements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Multi-adapter support, where each adapter can have
up to four physical links</p></li><li><p>Each link can have a maximum of 255 logical
channels</p></li><li><p>Control and configure each link separately</p></li><li><p>Control and configure each logical channel
separately</p></li><li><p>Support multiple protocols: Frame Relay, CHDLC,
PPP, X25, SDLC, etc.</p></li><li><p>Easily expandable (future protocols)</p></li><li><p>Support for both Routing and API applications
simultaneously</p></li><li><p>Secure socket for API applications (No silent
packet dropping allowed)</p></li><li><p>Local and remote debugging support</p></li><li><p>SNMP Support</p></li><li><p>Fast Tx and Rx paths</p></li><li><p>Proc file system support: statistics and
debugging</p></li><li><p>Driver Message/Event Logging</p></li><li><p>Easy updates and upgrades</p></li></ul></div><p>The following design rules were adopted in developing the
driver:
</p><p>1. WANPIPE drivers map each active physical link to a
separate device in the kernel. Each physical line can be
configured, restarted or debugged without conflicting with other
sync lines. WANPIPE drivers can support up to 16 devices, four
cards with four physical links.</p><p>2. Since WAN protocols can have many logical channels on a
single physical link, each channel is mapped to a network
interface. WAN protocols, such as Frame Relay or X.25, support
one-to-many connections through the use of logical channels. For
each physical line, WANPIPE supports up to 255 logical channels for
X.25 and 100 logical channels for Frame Relay. Each logical channel
can be restarted or reconfigured without bringing down all other
channels on the same physical link.</p><p>3. Management/debugging interface calls are user datagram
protocol (UDP) based and OS independent. Sangoma adopted a common
UDP-based interface for collecting statistics and managing WAN
links to provide an alternative to SNMP-based tools that are often
complicated and costly. Sangoma felt that users should be able to
easily interrogate and manage the system remotely, using tools that
are included in the WANPIPE package.</p><p>The system developed is UDP-based and operating system
independent so that, for instance, a Windows GUI application can be
used to monitor a remote Linux system. The system is password-free
but can be made to operate in a highly secure manner.</p><p>4. Each network interface can support either API or ROUTING
mode. Aside from IP routing, many of Sangoma's customers use the
Sangoma S series as communication building blocks for their own
applications, using our published applications program interfaces
(API). These applications include such diverse uses as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Providing unidirectional broadcasts of financial
information and newscasts over satellite links.</p></li><li><p>Monitoring cellular switch information using
X.25.</p></li><li><p>Emulation of IBM mainframes or controllers over
SDLC, X.25 or BSC.</p></li><li><p>Controlling military hardware using HDLC
LAPB.</p></li></ul></div><p>For maximum flexibility, the architecture was designed so
that API calls and standard IP routing traffic can coexist on any
physical port. For instance, a set of X.25 logical channels can be
used to provide standard IP connectivity between a series of
locations while other channels are used to exchange point-of-sale
(POS) credit card swipe information that is not IP-based. The
driver can accept API or routing packets simultaneously, depending
on the network interface setup.
</p><p>5. No API packets to be dropped by the stack. IP stacks are
designed to silently discard packets when congested. This is
accepted behavior in the IP world, where data integrity is ensured
by higher-level TCP protocol. However, in the case of
error-correcting protocols such as BSC, HDLC LAPB, X.25 and SDLC,
it is assumed that once a packet has been acknowledged at the link
level, delivery to the application is guaranteed. Therefore, it was
absolutely necessary that the WANPIPE raw socket stack would not
silently drop packets.</p><p>6. WANPIPE device drivers should be loaded as modules into
the Linux kernel.</p><p>Using modules, rather than compiling the kernel, makes it
easy to update the driver. Also, because only the modules need to
be compiled, no reboot is needed.</p><p>Employing the above design rules, WANPIPE device drivers
maximize the utility of the S series cards. Clearly defined data,
debugging and (re)configuration paths enable simultaneous
multiprotocol operation to be efficient, configurable and
manageable. The design of the driver is shown in Figure 1.</p><p>

the Linux Kernel</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b92700"></a>WANPIPE and the Linux Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Figure 1 shows how the WANPIPE device driver fits into the
Linux kernel architecture. Linux is divided into two operating
regions, the user space and the kernel space. All applications,
d&aelig;mons and utilities execute in the user-space, while kernel
and device drivers execute in the kernel space. Communications
between user space applications and the kernel are facilitated
through system calls such as ioctl.</p><p>Device drivers, an integral part of the Linux kernel,
interface hardware components to the operating system. Drivers are
usually compiled into the kernel or provided as independent,
separate modules that can be dynamically loaded or unloaded at run
time.</p><p>Sangoma used modular drivers in WANPIPE because modules can
easily be updated and reloaded while the kernel is running,
eliminating the need for costly system reboots.</p><p>WANPIPE, being a network device driver, uses network
interfaces to bind to the Linux kernel stack. The network
interfaces contains Level 3 protocol information (IP) as well as
driver entry points, enabling the Linux kernel stack, via the
network interface, to control driver operation: interface shutdown,
startup, statistics and data communications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b92910"></a>WANPIPE Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The WANPIPE configuration process starts with creating a
detailed configuration file that outlines the hardware, protocol
and IP options as well as location of the adapter firmware. Once
completed, WANPIPE driver modules are loaded into the kernel. The
initial module load allocates necessary resources, initializes and
sets up the proc file system directories and enables the ioctl
system calls. Since loaded modules do not have enough information
to completely configure the card, ioctl system calls are used to
pass the contents of the configuration file to the driver. The
final step in WANPIPE configuration is to configure and start up
network interfaces using the ifconfig() command. The sequence is
shown in Table 1.</p><p><a href="4471t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Configuring and Starting up
Network Interfaces</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b92ac8"></a>WANPIPE and Routing</h2></div></div><p>The kernel IP layer provides a packet transfer service; that
is, given a packet complete with addressing information, it will
take care of the transfer. In conjunction with the IP layer, the
routing table (see Table 2) determines the forwarding order of all
incoming packets.</p><p><a href="4471t2.html" target="_self">Table 2. Kernel IP Routing
Table</a></p><p>Once the WANPIPE network interface (wp1_fr16) is up and
running, the kernel routing table is updated with the interface's
IP information. The wp1_fr16 interface has two entries. The first
one specifies the destination network and the second indicates a
default route, meaning that all IP addresses not specified in the
above routing table will be forwarded to wp1_fr16 interface.</p><p>Upon successful driver configuration, network interfaces and
routing tables can be viewed and modified from the user space using
the standard Linux commands:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>ifconfig&mdash;display or modify network
interfaces</p></li><li><p>route&mdash;display or modify the routing table</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b92ee8"></a>WANPIPE and the APIs</h2></div></div><p>An API is used to send and receive custom RAW, non-IP packets
to and from the card. Since data is not communicated in IP format,
the network interface is configured without the IP address. This
effectively removes the kernel routing table entry and unhooks the
IP routing stack from the WANPIPE driver. Non-IP communication is
achieved using the RAW socket calls to the driver. As the name
implies, packets are transferred without any modification.</p><p>To ensure that packets that had been acknowledged at the card
level were never lost, a secure socket solution was developed: a
custom WANPIPE socket that guarantees delivery in both upstream and
downstream directions. The WANPIPE socket is based on the Linux RAW
socket, developed by Alan Cox and others.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b93048"></a>Developing with the WANPIPE Secure Socket:
X.25API</h2></div></div><p>We provide the following as an example of working with the
WANPIPE API set. We have chosen X.25 as a line protocol because it
is probably the most complicated, involving call set up and
tear-down, logical channel management and exception condition
handling. X.25 is a packet-switched WAN protocol that (generally)
uses a public packet-switched network to route packets to different
end points. In operation, it appears to be similar to TCP/IP,
although the underlying mechanisms are quite different. Line speeds
are almost always below 256KBps, usually below 64KBps. Its
operation is analogous to a telephone. A call must be initiated,
and once the call is accepted, data can be transmitted. When data
transmission is over, the call is cleared. Using the WANPIPE secure
socket, X.25API programming is very similar to TCP/IP
programming.</p><p>To continue our example, we assume that the WANPIPE drivers
are configured and successfully started, and that the X25 link is
up and running (see Listings 1 and 2 at our FTP
site&mdash;<a href="../listings/082/" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue82</a>).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b93200"></a>WANPIPE Debugging</h2></div></div><p>WANs, by their nature, are quite complicated. There are
usually several players, including one or more Telcos, often a
public network provider and often a separate ISP that adds to the
confusion. The inevitable line teething problems and ongoing line
debugging can often denigrate into futile finger-pointing
exercises.</p><p>For this reason, a major part of the WANPIPE development has
been devoted to debugging. Sangoma's philosophy is to provide
customers with enough debugging information so that the customers
can solve most problems by themselves. Furthermore, if support is
necessary, Sangoma tech support must have enough information to
solve the problem remotely.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b93360"></a>The xPipemon Programs</h2></div></div><p>Each WAN protocol has its own debugging utility that is used
to determine the status of the driver and physical line, obtain
protocol state and statistics, as well as raw and interpreted line
traces. The data transfer involved in the monitors is UDP-based.
Remote systems can be debugged via the Internet, without logging
into the user system, while system security can be tightly managed.
UDP calls are OS-independent, meaning that a remote Linux machine
can debug a WANPIPE card running in a FreeBSD or Windows
machine.</p><p>Since system security is an important issue, the UDP
debugging commands can be turned off by setting the UDPPORT to 0,
or better yet, by setting the TTL (time to live) value to a small
one. By setting the TTL value to one, for example, only users that
are logged into the machine or located in front of the first router
will be able to operate the debugger. The TTL and UDPPORT values
are configurable in the WANPIPE configuration file.</p><p>A current list of monitors and typical commands is given in
Table 3. Under Windows, X and other graphic environments, the
complicated command lines are replaced by simple GUI
applications.</p><p><a href="4471t3.html" target="_self">Table 3. Monitors and Typical
Commands</a></p><p>The driver receives management requests via the UDP/IP stack.
All received requests are then forwarded into a low priority queue.
A low priority thread handles requests and sends the results back
up the stack, to the originating IP address. UDP debug requests can
also come from the network where the request is sent back through
the line. Management connections through the network interface are
treated differently from traffic from &ldquo;above&rdquo;. Only statistics
are available through the network, while access from above allows
the user to also reconfigure, test and set up the CSU/DSU and run
line traces.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b93620"></a>Proc File System</h2></div></div><p>The proc file system is a memory mapped virtual directory
structure that is used to provide driver and kernel information.
Management systems, such as SNMP, use the proc file systems to
obtain kernel/driver statistics and states. The WANPIPE driver
binds into the proc file system by setting up /proc/net/wanrouter
directory. This directory contains virtual files for each WANPIPE
device. WANPIPE configuration and statistics can be obtained by
reading/opening supported /proc files. To display tx, rx and error
statistics for, say, the wanpipe1 device, use this command:
<b  >cat /proc/net/wanrouter/wanpipe1</b></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa2580.0x1b93780"></a>Log Messages</h2></div></div><p>All WANPIPE events are logged via the syslog d&aelig;mon, in
the /var/log/messages file. Note, syslog can be reconfigured to
forward messages to a different location. To view the messages log
continuously, execute: <b  >tail -f
/var/log/messages</b>.</p></div></div>
