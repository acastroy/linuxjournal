Company</p></li><li><p>E-mail: info@thinknic.com</p></li><li><p>URL:
<a href="http://www.thinknic.com" target="_self">http://www.thinknic.com/</a></p></li><li><p>Price: $199 US</p></li><li><p>Reviewer: Bill Ball</p></li></ul></div><p>Larry Ellison is well known as one of the first persons to
coin the term &ldquo;Network Computer&rdquo;, a much-heralded promise of
low-cost network appliances and terminals for corporate America.
His latest spin-off venture, The New Internet Computer Company, may
become known for fulfilling that promise by actually producing and
selling the lowest-cost Internet and network capable computer on
the market today&mdash;the NIC, or New Internet Computer.
</p><p>At $199 for a main box, speakers, keyboard and mouse, the NIC
provides a surprising host of features. A color-matched $129
15-inch monitor is optional. Perhaps the best feature of all is
that the NIC runs Linux! All the software you need to start surfing
the Web is included on a bootable CD-ROM that sports a Linux 2.2.15
kernel, Netscape Navigator, and connection software for dial-up
ISPs, DSL, cable modems or an internal network. This means that you
can get to work right away.</p><p>As if the price point on this piece of hardware wasn't low
enough, you can also use free ISP service from NetZero with your
NIC. You're not locked into using the offered service, though, so
if you want to use your existing ISP, your company's LAN, or your
at-home DSL or cable modem, go ahead.</p><p>Linux is finding its way into the computer industry in an
ever-increasing variety of platforms, ranging from &ldquo;Big Iron&rdquo;
servers the size of refrigerators to embedded devices and web
servers that fit inside a box of matches. You'll find that the NIC
provides a simple, inexpensive way to browse the World Wide Web,
use electronic mail and read Usenet news.</p><p>You must order your NIC on-line at
<a href="http://www.thinknic.com" target="_self">http://www.thinknic.com/</a>.
You'll receive e-mail confirmation of your order, and you can track
the shipping through NIC's web site. You'll then receive a box
containing the NIC, a keyboard, mouse, mouse pad, amplified
speakers, NIC software on CD-ROM, power cords, phone cable,
warranty information and a short, ten-page user guide. You'll also
get free Internet service from NetZero. This means no confusing
service agreements, obfuscated rebates or other insidious deals
aimed at enticing consumers to the Dark Side's network.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f4580.0x13ecb30"></a>Initial Impressions</h2></div></div><p>The NIC is a single-board computer sporting a 266MHz Cyrix
CPU, 64MB RAM and a CD-ROM drive. The front of the unit sports a
power and reset button. On the back, you'll find two USB ports, two
PS/2 ports for the NIC keyboard and mouse, a video out connector
for a monitor, an RJ-45 jack for built-in 10MBps Ethernet, two
RJ-11 jacks for the NIC's built-in 56K modem and a (curiously)
nonfunctional joystick port. You can orient the NIC horizontally
or, if you prefer, vertically using two detachable feet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f4580.0x13ecc38"></a>Getting to Work</h2></div></div><p>My initial intent was to hook the new NIC to my LAN, as I use
Linux, DSL and IP masquerading for Internet access. I unpacked the
NIC, plugged in all the cables, connected the NIC to a nearby hub
and turned on the computer. I then inserted the NIC CD-ROM, pressed
Enter, saw an initial splash screen on my spare monitor and
then...nothing! The screen cleared, and a small, flat blinking
cursor appeared on the upper-left corner of my monitor as the
CD-ROM spun down.</p><p>With a sinking feeling in my gut, I called NIC's technical
support line and was connected to a help technician in less than
ten minutes. After describing my problem, Rod, the technician, told
me to turn off the NIC, then power it up and tap the keyboard's
Delete key twice to access the NIC's built-in Award BIOS. After
loading the default CMOS and system setups and saving the changes,
the NIC rebooted, brought up Linux and displayed its initial
configuration screen in 65 seconds. You may need to do this if you
change the NIC's monitors between boot-ups.</p><p>When you first start the NIC, the system will boot Linux,
load X11 and bring up a desktop running Netscape with a
configuration screen, as shown in Figure 1.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4475f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The NIC's default application and configuration tool is
Netscape Navigator, version 4.72.
</p></div></div><p>There are a number of ways to access the Internet using the
NIC. You can set up a free Internet account with NetZero using the
built-in modem, configure the NIC to dial up and connect with your
current ISP, or configure the NIC to use your LAN and a default
gateway for Internet access or use as an X11 terminal. For those
unfortunate users without local calling access to an ISP or
NetZero, you can also set up the NIC to access BamNet at $0.06 US
per minute. When you start the setup, you'll see a dialog, as shown
in Figure 2.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4475f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. You can use NetZero's free service, your current ISP or
an existing Ethernet LAN for Internet access.
</p></div></div><p>After making sure a phone line was plugged into the back of
the NIC, I then signed up for NetZero's free Internet service.
After filling out several dialogs, the NIC dialed into NetZero and
I was surfing. This took about about 15 minutes. Unfortunately,
NetZero requires a floating advertising bar on your screen, or
you'll be disconnected.</p><p>I also connected using my local backup ISP and was able to
create the account and dial in within a few minutes. Connection
speed was nearly 56KBps using the NIC's internal modem.</p><p>Setting up Ethernet and using a default gateway on my LAN
gave me Internet access in less than 30 seconds. All settings are
saved in the NIC's flash memory. You should know that the NIC's
system does not offer Netscape Messenger for mail or Netscape
Discussions for browsing Usenet news. You'll also find that the
Preferences menu item under the Edit menu is grayed out and
inaccessible. To use electronic mail or other services, you'll need
to use remote web sites or local server software.</p><p>Sound is supported, and Real's RealPlayer G2 for Linux is
included. This means you can browse to your favorite Internet news
radio, TV or movie sites and hear stereo sound. The NIC's external
speakers are small but amplified and feature a 3-D sound push
button.</p><p>The fact that the NIC only offers Netscape and Internet Relay
Chat when used as a basic Internet workstation could be viewed as a
limitation. However, if you select the NIC's tools button on the
local &ldquo;Meet the NIC&rdquo; web page (http://localhost), you'll find a
button labeled &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; that brings up a desktop window with
folders for a Windows Citrix client, assorted solitaire and board
games, a secure shell terminal, Telnet terminal, ATT's vncviewer
client and a simple IRC client. This is the extent of the software
available on the NIC's CD-ROM.</p><p>I was also able to quickly turn my NIC into a networked X11
workstion and run clients from my server by first clicking the
NIC's Xhost+ utility, starting a telnet session, then exporting the
NIC's DISPLAY variable like this (I named the NIC &ldquo;nic&rdquo;, of
course):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ export DISPLAY=nic:0
</pre><p>I then ran numerous clients, as shown in Figure 3.
</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4475f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. The NIC also performs admirably as a
networked workstation.</p></div></div>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f4580.0x13ed688"></a>Under the Hood</h2></div></div><p>If you have the temerity to undo three screws on the back of
the NIC, you can quickly access its innards, as shown in Figure 4.
A quick peek shows a single-board computer, fan-cooled CPU, small
power supply (with fan) and a CD-ROM drive. A 64MB PC100 DIMM
provides system memory. A flash memory chip is used to save
configuration settings and other items. Ethernet is provided by an
SiS 900 chip set.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4475f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The NIC is a simple, single-board computer with few
parts.
</p></div></div><p>The NIC is a bargain considering the current street price of
a single 64MB PC100 DIMM. Compare the NIC to Compaq's $499 iPAQ,
IBM's $699 NetVista and ClearCube's $1,395 C3, and you'll see that
the NIC is the least expensive, uses the same or smaller footprint
and only lacks a hard drive. Linux hardware hackers will want to
take a much closer look at the NIC's Award BIOS and IDE interface.
Software wizards may want to explore modifying the Linux CD-ROM and
perhaps building a custom system to support external storage USB
devices. One could, at the very least, burn a new CD with
additional X11 clients.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f4580.0x13ed9a0"></a>Hacking the NIC</h2></div></div><p>Obviously, the NIC is most easily used in a straightforward
manner, either as a dial-up Internet appliance or a browser station
attached to an existing LAN. Aside from playing some solitaire or
pegboard games, the NIC's main function is to provide Netscape as a
window to the Web.</p><p>The first thing you'll want to do is mount the NIC's CD-ROM
in another computer and take a peek at the 200MB Linux file system.
Don't bother booting the CD on another computer&mdash;you'll only get a
kernel panic for your effort. After perusing the CD, you'll soon
see that the NIC runs a Linux system stripped of nearly all
software and services. Does this mean that you can't get a bit more
functionality out of the system or modify the default folders and
software?</p><p>Certainly not! After looking around, I found that I was able
to launch nearly any X11 client from the CD-ROM while the NIC was
running by using Netscape and a convenient launching client named
<span   class="bold"><b>launchapp</b></span> in Netscape's URL field.
For example, to pop up an rxvt terminal window with root access,
you can use a URL like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://localhost/cgi-bin/launchapp?/usr/X11R6/bin/rxvt
</pre><p>By the way, although not initially obvious, windows under the
default Blackbox window manager are resizable. You have to put your
pointer on the extreme lower-right corner of a client's window,
then click and drag to resize. The grab area is small&mdash;about 20
pixels high by five pixels wide.
</p><p>Once I had a root access terminal window, it was easy to
start poking around while the NIC's file system was running. I next
turned my attention to the NIC's desktop features. The NIC's tools
folder is stored in flash memory under the /flash directory. Under
the /flash/desktop directory, I found directories containing the
Blackbox configuration files for the default games, clients and
other utilities.</p><p>All I then needed to do was create my own entries to add
additional programs to the desktop. However, I searched the file
system in vain for any text editor, such as pico, jed or vi. Would
any Linux hacker give up at this point?</p><p>Definitely not! Every Linux system includes a text editor,
even if no text editors are installed. I navigated to the
/flash/desktop/XTerminal directory, then used the cat command,
along with output redirection, to create a desktop entry for the
rxvt client:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# cat &gt;rxvt.desktop&lt;\n&gt;
desktop_entry:
        name = rxvt
        icon = /img/telnet.gif
        comment = rxvt
        exec = /usr/X11R6/bin/rxvt
        terminal = false
        type = application
</pre><p>After pressing Enter at the last line, I then pressed Ctrl+D
to save the file. Reopening the tools and desktop folder revealed
the new entry. But what happens if you make a mistake or
misconfigure your NIC's flash memory?
</p><p>Don't worry. Just be happy that there's a &ldquo;special&rdquo; cgi-bin
script you can use to upgrade or reset your NIC to factory status.
Use the following undocumented URL:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
http://localhost/special.html
</pre><p>You'll see a screen that allows you to update the system
using a CD-ROM from The New Internet Computer Company or wipe your
system clean of its configuration.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f4580.0x13e47b0"></a>What's Missing?</h2></div></div><p>Although the current NIC software distribution is labelled
version 1.1, the only supported USB device happens to be the only
supported printer&mdash;the Epson Stylus Color 740 printer. Considering
the unused disk space available on the CD-ROM, I'd expect expanded
printer support and many additional games, utilities or X11
clients. Also missing is a working help system or even a local copy
of the users guide in HTML. Considering that the main NIC
application is Netscape, the default home page should at least be
set to an index for a small help system. The default Blackbox root
menu should be modified to provide additional virtual desktops and
window handling. Keeping in the spirit of open source, The New
Internet Computer Company graciously provides links to all the
source and patches used to build the NIC's CD-ROM. Browse to
<a href="http://www.thinknic.com/gpl.html" target="_self">www.thinknic.com/gpl.html</a>.
You'll find links to every software package, including a link to an
ISO9660 image of an updated version 1.2 system CD-ROM!</p><p>Despite some small initial limitations, the fact is that the
NIC works very well. This appliance represents the first, best and
least expensive of the new breed of affordable Internet and network
appliance computers. Viewed in the context of its design, this
device is a bargain. And considering that the NIC runs Linux, this
device offers a tantalizing opportunity for Linux hardware and
software hackers.</p><p><a href="4475s1.html" target="_self">The Good/The Bad</a></p></div></div>
