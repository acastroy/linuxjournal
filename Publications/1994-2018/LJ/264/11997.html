Linaro Announces Software Reference Platform for ARM</h2></div></div><p>
With the launch of its Software Reference Platform for ARMv8-A processors,
Linaro is proud to enable both a complete end-to-end open-source server
software stack and access to enterprise-class ARM-based server hardware for
developers. The build for the Linaro Enterprise Group is a complete
reference implementation for ARM servers, including open-source boot
software and firmware implementing the ARM Trusted Firmware, UEFI and ACPI
standards, a Linux 4.4 kernel, tested latest Debian and CentOS
distributions, OpenStack, OpenJDK, Hadoop and Spark. A build for the Linaro
Mobile Group also is available. Linaro expects the platform to be utilized
by Linaro members and the wider community for enterprise products and
cloud-instance development and deployment. During 2016, the Linaro Software
Reference Platform releases will provide market-segment-specific application
stacks to support an increasing range of data-center, networking and
home-gateway applications.

Kolab Systems AG and Collabora's CloudSuite</h2></div></div><p>
The chemistry created by the Kolab Systems-Collabora Productivity
partnership enabled CloudSuite, the first 100% open-source, enterprise-grade
cloud office suite. Kolab Systems' contribution is its Kolab open-source
groupware and collaboration framework; Collabora Productivity is the
architect behind LibreOffice Online, the cloud-based office productivity
suite. The integration of CloudSuite into Kolab allows users to work on
documents simultaneously using a full-featured on-line office suite.
Collaboratively, they can compose text documents, fill spreadsheets and
design presentations, even from different locations. Documents can be saved
in Microsoft-compatible and Open Document formats. The CloudSuite offering
also includes Collabora Office, a professional LibreOffice distribution, for
off-line use on the desktop. An important motivation for both firms in this
effort involves a desire to move away from closed and insecure solutions to
ones that respect users' freedoms, protect their privacy and
guarantee their work will not be locked away in proprietary formats.

AdaCore's SPARK Pro</h2></div></div><p>
With this new version of the SPARK Pro toolset, AdaCore comes one step
closer to its goal of making the writing of proven software both efficient and
pleasant. As part of its new SPARK Pro 16 integrated development and
verification environment, AdaCore further simplifies software engineers'
transition to greater reliance on static verification and formal proofs sans
need for expertise in mathematical logic. SPARK Pro 16 also provides
enhanced coverage of the SPARK 2014 language features and now supports the
Ravenscar tasking profile, thus extending the benefits of formal
verification methods to a safe subset of Ada 2012 concurrent programming
features. This new SPARK Pro can generate counter-examples to verification
conditions that cannot be proved, making it easier for developers to
find defects in the functional code or in the supplied contracts. Finally,
SPARK Pro 16 also improves the handling of bitwise/modular operations, and
the product's proof engine now includes the Z3 SMT solver.

Canonical and BQ's Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition Tablet</h2></div></div><p>
Canonical's broad vision for Ubuntu Linux is to offer a single,
converged personal computing experience across devices. This vision has
taken a leap forward with the launch of the Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition
tablet, &ldquo;the first fully converged Ubuntu device&rdquo; released by
Canonical together with its European partner, BQ. As a converged
device, the Aquarius M10 with dynamically adaptive user experience is
capable of providing both a true tablet and the full Ubuntu desktop
experiences. The former becomes the latter by simply plugging in a monitor
via the HDMI port or connecting a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth.
Canonical hopes to offer customers everything they have come to expect from
an Ubuntu PC, now on the tablet. Ubuntu is already the preferred desktop OS
for more than 30 million users worldwide, and the first Ubuntu phones have proven
successful as well. With this latest software release and the launch of the
Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition, Canonical notes that Ubuntu is now the only
platform that runs both a mobile-based full-touch interface and a true PC
experience from a single smart device. Hundreds of apps and scopes
(content-specific home screens) already are available in the Ubuntu App
Store.

Varnish Software's Hitch</h2></div></div><p>
Making life easier for the 2.2 million Web sites that deploy the Varnish
Cache HTTP engine is the point of Hitch from Varnish Software. The recently
updated Hitch is a scalable, open-source network proxy designed to
handle tens of thousands of connections on multicore machines efficiently.
Maker Varnish describes Hitch's benefits as easy to configure, a low
memory footprint and the ideal way of terminating client-side SSL/TLS for
Varnish. The deployment process for Varnish Cache is streamlined by the
support for the PROXY protocol, which lets Varnish consider the original
client's endpoints as if there were no TLS proxy in between. Hitch is tested
on Linux, but works on other *nixes as well. Hitch's features
include support for TLS1.0-1.2; SNI, with and without wild-card certificates;
support for HAProxy's PROXY protocol; seamless configuration run-time reload
support and performance of up to 15,000 listening sockets and 500,000
certificates.

ACI Worldwide's UP Retail Payments</h2></div></div><p>
As customers of global-payments solution provider ACI Worldwide retire aging
platforms, they are clamoring for Linux-based options. ACI Worldwide has
responded with a Red Hat Enterprise Linux version of UP Retail Payments, a
complete and customizable end-to-end enterprise payments solution. UP Retail
Payments, targeted at banks and processors, combines the benefits of
ACI's BASE24 and UP BASE24-eps solutions. BASE24 is ACI's retail
payment platform; UP Framework orchestrates any payment type, channel,
currency or network. ACI's approach with this solution is like a bridge
between BASE24 customers' current systems and evolving end-user demands,
enabling them to continue running some or all of their systems into the
foreseeable future. This strategy lowers risk and costs, adds ACI,
eliminating the need to &ldquo;rip and replace&rdquo; systems to address
emerging payment needs. ACI emphasizes the advantages of the new RHEL version of
UP Retail Payments, such as a 50% reduction in TCO while increasing
performance, scalability and
reliability.

EnterpriseDB's EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EDB Postgres Enterprise
Manager</h2></div></div><p>
The elegance of open source is on full display with new product releases
like EnterpriseDB's (EDB's) new PostreSQL-based database solutions.
On the heels of the significant PostgreSQL 9.5 update come two EnterpriseDB
solutions that take Postgres further, namely EDB Postgres Advanced Server
9.5 and EDB Postgres Enterprise Manager 6.0. EDB Postgres Advanced Server
integrates additional capabilities and security into Postgres that large
companies and governments require in order to use it, and this new v9.5
features the following: preconfigured integration with Hadoop and MongoDB, enhanced
security with password profiles, expanded compatibility with Oracle to ease
and speed migrations, and dramatic performance increases through vertical
scaling optimizations. Meanwhile, EDB Postgres Enterprise Manager, EDB's
single console for tuning, monitoring and administering large Postgres
deployments, adds enhancements as well in this v6.0 release. These include
Nagios support, failover management, a streaming replication wizard, audit
log alerts and an improved alert UI.

BitTorrent Inc.'s Sync</h2></div></div><p>
The Sync application from BitTorrent Inc. is simple yet powerful, offering
the ability to move large amounts of data directly between devices. The new
Sync 2.3 provides new features to support power users seeking to
unlock Sync's full potential. BitTorrent says that Sync is simple to use
in combination with a cloud provider's storage space or NAS to ensure
data redundancy for backup. Of course, having data stored anywhere on
third-party infrastructure is a serious concern. The new Encrypted Folder feature
in Sync 2.3 solves this issue by providing the ability to encrypt data at
rest on any designated location. Encrypted Folders can be shared to
read-only nodes to provide an off-site snapshot of data without providing
direct access, or users can deploy multiple Encrypted Folders to increase
the reliability of a peer swarm. Another new feature is support for moving
data to and from an SD card on Android 5+ devices. Finally, Selective Sync
support is available on all flavors of Sync for Linux. Users download only
the files they need, when they need them, without having to replicate entire
folders on their beloved Linux boxes.
