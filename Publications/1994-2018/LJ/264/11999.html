We're huge fans of open source here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, which I'm sure comes
as no surprise to anyone. The best part about Linux itself, however,
is that it's the concept of open source realized. It has permeated
every aspect of IT, and it has proven that being open doesn't equate to being
insecure. In fact, it's quite the opposite. When you have nothing to hide,
there aren't any dirty secrets waiting to be leaked. In the spirit of
&ldquo;doing things&rdquo;, this month we've got a bunch of really cool topics that
show open source in action.
</p><p>
We start with Reuven M. Lerner. Last month he talked about navigating
data, and this month he talks about Pandas. Specifically, Reuven
talks about parsing and analyzing CSV (comma-separated values) files
with Python. If you're a data nerd and want to get the most from your
CSV data files, you won't want to miss Reuven's column this issue.
Dave Taylor
follows with a look at some powerful scripting commands borrowed
from the C library. If you want to tighten your code, the printf command
is incredibly powerful and thankfully available for scripting.
</p><p>
Kyle Rankin keeps his security head firmly in place and starts a series
on Qubes this month. Qubes is a distribution focused on security. With all the publicity
encryption and privacy is getting thanks to the Apple/FBI case, it's
important to understand how security on your devices functions. Kyle
starts his series by describing how Qubes compartmentalizes applications,
isolating them from each other and the OS itself. Whether or not you want to
beef up your desktop security, his article is a fascinating look
at an awesome technology.
</p><p>
I go in a very different direction this month, and rather than talk about
security, I focus on what sometimes can be the opposite of security&mdash;convenience. I've always wanted a smart house, and thanks to SmartThings
and the Amazon Echo, I finally have one&mdash;or at least the start of one. If
you've ever wanted to talk to your house like it was the computer on
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Starship Enterprise</em></span>, you'll want to check out my
column.
</p><p>
SSH is arguably my favorite command-line tool in Linux. It's secure,
and it's so versatile. Ramon Crichlow explains how to stream video
securely through an SSH tunnel this month. Not only will you learn how to
accomplish a cool video streaming task, but along the way, you'll learn a lot
about how SSH works and what tunneling really means. You'll also learn how
to tweak it so it's not more frustrating than useful!
</p><p>
Charles Fisher follows Ramon with a very in-depth look at using stunnel
as a tool for authentication, isolation and privacy of data stored in
an Oracle database. If you've ever managed an Oracle database and had
concerns about its security implementations (even considering recent
improvements), using the open-source stunnel tool can add a solid layer
of security that is regularly updated and offers the peace of mind that
comes with FOSS.
</p><p>
Whether you want to improve the security of your desktop environment,
use Linux as a tool to accomplish a necessary function, or just turn
on your bedroom lights by talking to a Pringles-can-shaped robot, this
month is an issue worth reading. As always, it's also full of product
announcements, time-saving tips and other Linux-related goodies. Whether
this is your first issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> or you've been one of us
for years, we hope you enjoy this issue as much as we enjoyed putting
it together.
