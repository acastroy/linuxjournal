What's the Kernel Space of Democracy?

No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has
been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all
those other forms that have been tried from time to time.&mdash;Winston
Churchill
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2058580.0x2150250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Might the same be said of operating systems and Linux? In both cases
people live atop, and depend on, a deeper protected and enabling
structure. In democracies, it's government. In Linux, it's the kernel.
There are resemblances. For example, both need debugging, no matter how
much bigger and better they get. A difference (one of too many, I'll
admit) is that Linux gets debugged by contributors and maintainers,
while in democracies, users are free to mess with the government, and
vice versa, by many means. 
</p><p>
Still, although government space bears little resemblance to kernel space,
the question haunts me, because I can't help thinking democracies might
learn something from Linux.
</p><p>
It can't be easy. Politics never is. Although government runs on the form
of code we call law, those that operate on it are not compelled to obey,
or even to agree. Craig Butron highlights the difference when he says
&ldquo;all technical problems are technical and political&mdash;and you can
always solve the technical ones.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The contradictions of democracy are old news. Otto Von Bismarck
said
&ldquo;Politics is the art of the possible&mdash;the art of the next
best.&rdquo;
Yet he also said, &ldquo;Not by speeches and votes of the majority, are the
great questions of the time decided...but by iron and blood.&rdquo; While
democracy might be as old as Greece, war is as old as our species, and
perhaps even its evolutionary antecedents.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Compared to war, all other forms of human endeavor shrink to
insignificance&rdquo;, said George S. Patton.
Among those forms of human
endeavor are democracy and governance. Even the rule of law, which all
democracies strive to maintain, is suspended gladly when battle flags
are raised. In <span   class="emphasis"><em>War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning</em></span>, Christopher Hedges
writes: 
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
War makes the world understandable, a black and white tableau
of them and us. It suspends thought, especially self-critical thought.
All bow before the supreme effort. We are one. Most of us willingly
accept war as long as we can fold it into a belief system that paints the
ensuing suffering as necessary for a higher good, for human beings seek
not only happiness but also meaning. And tragically war is sometimes the
most powerful way in human society to achieve meaning.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Of course, meaning to one faction is not the same as to another.
</p><p>
Many years ago, on a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Geek Cruise (man, those were fun), I
gave a talk about political differences&mdash;for example, how one side tends
to see the market as a problem and government as a solution, while the
other side tends to see government as a problem and the market as a
solution. My main source for that talk was George Lakoff's
1996
book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Moral Politics: What Conservatives Know that Liberals
Don't</em></span>
(re-subtitled in 2002 as <span   class="emphasis"><em>How Liberals and Conservatives
Think</em></span>). Even if
you disagree with George's conclusions (or his politics), he does an
outstanding job of laying out how liberals and conservatives talk past
each other while constantly characterizing each other (sometimes
correctly), and how hard it is for both sides to see truth in the
others' framings. (Since the turn of the Millennium, George has
written many other books, mostly to give Democrats new ways to frame
debates. I believe Barack Obama would not have been elected, or
re-elected, to the Presidency in 2008 and 2012, without those books. They
mattered enormously to Obama's campaigns.)
</p><p>
After my talk, Andrew Morton
said, &ldquo;That's why the left thinks the
right is evil, and the right thinks the left is stupid.&rdquo; I still can't
think of a better summary statement.
</p><p>
I was given a similar hunk of wisdom by David Hodskins, my business
partner for two decades and one of the smartest businessmen I have ever
known: &ldquo;Republicans are the party of wealth creation and Democrats are
the party of wealth redistribution.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Consistent with that, I know Republicans who think all the good in the
world is produced by business, while I know Democrats who think nature
put a sum of money in the world and that it's the job of government to
make sure those who have too much yield some of it to those who have too
little. At one extreme, we have people who don't see how government
produces any good (besides, as Ronald Reagan put it, &ldquo;defending the
borders&rdquo;), and at the other extreme, we have people who don't respect much
of what business does, besides providing jobs.
</p><p>
Around both poles gathers homophily: &ldquo;the tendency of individuals to
associate and bond with similar others&rdquo;. Those associations and bonds
also comprise echo chambers within which even friendly and helpful
voices tend to go unheard or misunderstood.
</p><p>
For example, a few years back, I suggested at a university meeting that
we ought to define what the Internet actually is, because there is no
common definitional ground between net-heads and bell-heads (those who
see the Internet as a transcendent entity and those who see it as just a
service offered by phone and cable companies). I said the university
would do the world a service by coming up with a canonical definition. A
professor replied, &ldquo;I didn't think we were going to work on policy
this year.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Whoa! This isn't about policy. It's
about language. Linguistics. Dictionary stuff.&rdquo; But the discussion
drifted toward policy anyway, and the desire by nearly all present for
net neutrality regulation, which made sense. After all, this was an
echo chamber for netheads, including me (example: Cluetrain's
New
Clues). But I'm also a business guy, and at the time had at least
<span   class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span>
hope that a university could think in more, um, universal ways. But
universities tend to be castles, and this was an example of the one on
the left in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11992f1.large.jpg"><img src="11992f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Two Castles
</p></div></div><p>
On the right were phone and cable companies who talk about &ldquo;saving the
marketplace&rdquo; and &ldquo;keeping government out of
business&rdquo;, even though they
are regulatory zoo animals holding their keepers so captive that they
have successfully lobbied legislation restricting business to themselves
in all but a handful of states (<a href="http://www.muninetworks.org/communitymap" target="_self">www.muninetworks.org/communitymap</a>) and wouldn't know what to do in a truly
open marketplace.
</p><p>
Speaking of netheads and bellheads, it's interesting to see how net
neutrality has gone since I wrote about it in the July 2006 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8979" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8979</a>). In it, I sourced Larry Lessig, Vint Cerf and Michael
Powell, who was then a recently retired FCC chairman and is now cable's
top lobbyist. Here are a few one-liners from a talk he gave at Freedom
to Connect that year:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...be careful of inviting the legislative process when they have a very
bad understanding of the technical underpinnings. Because the secondary
consequences of their errors can be enormous.
</p><p>
I would rather try constantly to position my industry where I succeed
if government does nothing, versus positioning it in a way where I need
them to do something or I'm dead.
</p><p>
I can tell you right now, very few people in Washington (understand net
neutrality). This means you're going to get a potentially very
ambiguous, subject to massive variations in interpretation, pile of
law.
</p><p>
...government has a way of turning on people. Ask Bill Gates. It may be
about networks today, but those same principles can be used against
innovative business models and applications in other contexts. And, I
submit to you they would be.
</p><p>
Be careful because you're playing their game....The average one of these
incumbents, whether a cable or a phone company, have 40 lawyers in
Washington dedicated to this work. Resources. Ability. One hundred years
of skill....Then, let me add the judicial process. Every decision you get
from the Congress and the FCC will spend the next three and a half to
four years in court. 
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Since then, no net neutrality legislation proposed in Congress has moved
past the committee stage. But on the regulatory side, the FCC in 2010
issued the pro-neutrality Open Internet Order. In September 2011, the
FCC added a final rule titled Preserving the Open Internet. Naturally,
Verizon sued, eventually winning Verizon v. FCC in the DC Circuit
Court of Appeals, which vacated two of the three main portions of the
FCC's Order. That happened in May 2014&mdash;right in line with Powell's
estimate for time in court.
</p><p>
But the battle is hardly over. In February 2015, the FCC issued &ldquo;strong,
sustainable rules to protect the open Internet&rdquo; by re-classifying
&ldquo;broadband Internet access service&rdquo; under Title II of the
Telecommunications Act. Like everything Federal, it's complicated,
which means it met mostly with approval by netheads and disapproval with
the bellheads. Expect some of this to be worked out (and not) over the
next few years.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Linux won without going to war, even though it had lots of
opposition from the start. Microsoft hated it, as did
competing UNIX and UNIX-ish operating system camps.
</p><p>
I showed up when Linux itself was to the right of the decimal point, in
the early 1990s. I was invited by Phil Hughes, who included me in an
e-mail conversation about starting a free software magazine. This became
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> in April 1994, when Linux arrived at v.1.0. (Little known
item: the first editor was Bob Young, who left to start Red Hat.) In
those days, and to a large degree ever since, the Linux homophily has
been largely a libertarian one. Perhaps this is a manifestation of the
distinction between kernel space and userspace. The perspective of the
kernel on userspace is like that of the Earth's core toward what
happens on its surface. As Linus often says about userspace, &ldquo;I don't
care.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Yet all of us live in userspace, and we have politics here, especially
between now and November, when the US holds its presidential election.
While that's happening, I suggest we technical folks look at the process
as one that requires debugging. Here are my suggested few:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Get money as far as possible out of politics. Larry Lessig has required
reading on this (<a href="http://republic.lessig.org" target="_self">republic.lessig.org</a>).
</p></li><li><p>
Amend the Constitution to eliminate the Electoral College and allow
direct election of the President.
</p></li><li><p>
Eliminate gerrymandering, as far as possible.
</p></li><li><p>
Expand voting rights to all citizens.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
All those are simply for restoring democracy and nothing more. Like many
in our community, I not only want better government, but less of it,
especially as we work out what it means to be digital as well as analog
creatures. For particulars on that, check out what I said about Ralph
Nader here in 2000 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4316" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4316</a>). A sample:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Consumers and workers are rhetorical relics. The Net is uniting both,
and they're throwing off their chains. Industrial communism and
capitalism are both terminal. They can't survive in a networked
marketplace, where &ldquo;We the People&rdquo; means exactly what it says.
</p><p>
We have real challenges in this marketplace, not the least of which is
understanding how it's going to work, now that &ldquo;the People&rdquo; are working
both sides of the supply-and-demand handshake. What are the new social
contracts? What laws do we really need, and why are we keeping the ones
we don't? How can we truly help those who can't help themselves? What
are our agreements about privacy and anonymity, and how do we organize
them? How do we build the needed infrastructure around our new Commons,
and how do we keep those stuck with dead industrial market models from
wasting our time?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Those questions still stand. So does the one in the headline above.
