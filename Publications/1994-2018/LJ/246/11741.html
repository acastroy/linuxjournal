Two-Column Format</h4><p>
I love being able to read <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> on my laptop,
but I can't stand the two-column format that is used in the PDF version. I need to magnify the text due to
poor eyesight, and the two-column format forces me to scroll down and then up
constantly in order to read all the text on a page. A one-column format for the
PDF would make for much smoother reading and navigation.
</p><p>
Please don't suggest I read the EPUB version. EPUB is a terrible format.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Scott Randby  <br><br>
</p><p>
It's tough to come up with a perfect format. The PDF version is designed to
look like the traditional magazine version, and it looks best (I think) on a
large format color tablet. If you look back, the older PDF versions were
even more difficult to read on a computer screen, as the layout mirrored
the paper version exactly.
</p><p>
I know you said you don't like the EPUB version, but I'm not sure whether you've 
tried reading the EPUB on a computer screen or only on eReaders. Using
something like Readium (<a href="http://www.readium.org" target="_self">www.readium.org</a>), you can change the font size and
read the text in a single column. Apart from that, I'm not sure what else 
to suggest. I'm not sure what you dislike about the EPUB version, so I don't know
how to help there if Readium doesn't work for you.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Subscription Question</h4><p>
I carry two tablets, one iOS and the other Android.
If I subscribe on my iPad to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, can I also read it on my Nexus 7?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Greg   <br><br>
</p><p>
If you subscribe directly through <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, we will
send you monthly notices with download links for .epub, .pdf, .mobi and browser
versions of the magazine. You also will get access through our Android or iOS
apps. 
</p><p>
We want our subscribers to be able to access the issues in any format that is
available. 
</p><p>
If you order through Google Play or iTunes, you will receive only those
versions. Both have
subscription options, but they are pretty much a closed environment. 
</p><p>
We want you to be able to access the magazine any way you choose. If you
subscribed
through Google Play or iTunes, please send your transaction ID, e-mail
address and full mailing
address (we use that to encrypt the files) to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. Once I have that, I can add you
to our subscription database as well. 
</p><p>
The best deal I have for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> directly is 
<a href="../../index.html" target="_self">https://www.pubservice.com/Subnew2page.aspx?PC=LJ&amp;PK=M48RENN</a>.
</p><p>
I hope that helps. Sorry that it's more complicated than we would like, but once
iTunes and Android closed their subscription environments, it became impossible
to extract those orders and automatically add them to our database so
readers can receive every
format we have.&mdash;Mark Irgang, Publisher

Leap Years in Bash&mdash;or Anywhere
</h4><p>
Regarding the detection of leap years in Dave Taylor's recent articles,
there is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>very simple</em></span> way to determine whether a year
is a leap year: if it's
divisible by 4 and not 100. So a simple modulus function will suffice:


<pre     class="programlisting">

YEAR=$( date "+%Y" )
if [ $(( ${YEAR} % 4 )) -eq 0 ] &amp;&amp; [ $(( ${YEAR} % 100 )) -ne 0 ]
then
echo 'Leap'
else
echo 'No Leap';
fi

</pre>
</p><p>
For the real geek, during a century, an integer binary number can be ANDed
with 0x03, and the result is represented by the modulus of 4. If 0, the leap year.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jacques Amar  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> There are lots of ways to calculate it, for sure. I like my latest:
just type <tt  >date -d 12/31/YEAR +%j</tt>, and see if it's
365 or 366.

Counting Days</h4><p>
Dave Taylor's Work the Shell column is one of my favorites in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
However, while reading the August 2014 issue, I thought &ldquo;don't re-invent
the wheel.&rdquo; In astronomy, getting the time interval (in days and fractions
thereof) between any dates is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>daily bread and butter</em></span> issue.
The solution is the Julian Date, a consecutive count of days from
centuries ago into the future. It is a relatively simple algorithm,
although not intuitive. See, for example,
<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/JD_Formula.php" target="_self">aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/JD_Formula.php</a>.
</p><p>
Yes, the algorithm is originally coded up in FORTRAN (what else
was there in the science world some decades ago), and we still use it.
A conversion to a shell script or any other programming language
should be easy.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Norbert Zacharias  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor responds:</b></span>
Holy cow, that's awesome stuff, Norbert! I haven't dabbled in
FORTRAN since the job I had while I was an undergrad at UCSD back in the
early 1980s. As it happens, I really enjoyed FORTRAN and enjoyed reading
the code too.
</p><p>
How that formula works, however, is a bit puzzling to me, as there are some
rather mysterious constants that don't seem like they should work.
Still, it'd be easy enough to recode as a shell script&mdash;in fact, the
FORTRAN code is <span   class="emphasis"><em>almost</em></span> workable as is with just a few tweaks. My only
comment: the lack of error checking makes me get a bit anxious with such
complicated formulae in the mix.
</p><p>
Thanks for pointing that out. Good stuff!

</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Norbert responds:</b></span>
Thanks for responding to my earlier e-mail.
Those constants are determined to &ldquo;make it work&rdquo;,
accounting for the fact that different months have
a different number of days (even going
over centuries) and so on. It is hard to understand the
algorithm; however, the result is a fast, accurate
algorithm. Testing was done on sample data, and
after verification, no further tests are needed as
part of the algorithm. Of course, one needs to be
very careful when cutting/pasting lines in order not
to screw it up.
</p><p>
PS. We still code in FORTRAN partly because we
inherited a large body of code in our area of
research and partly because the code is really
easy to write and efficient&mdash;it pays off when dealing
with billions of star positions. It even still can be done
on a modern laptop!

Suggestion</h4><p>
I am working for a telecom vendor on OSS products. Lately, I've been working on
NFV-related meetings and workgroups. There is a lot going with NFV all around
telco operators, and almost all will run on Linux/KVM/OpenStack. There is
and will be a lot of work done and money spent on this issue. Operators are
pushing vendors for open source. There is OpenDaylight as well for SDN. The
vendors are big ones, such as Ericsson, Huawei, ALU, Oracle, Cisco,
Nokia, Microsoft and HP. Some other vendors are AT&amp;T, Orange and TIM. Those are
the biggest players around.
</p><p>
You are <span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> Linux magazine, yet I see almost nothing on these issues. This
disappoints me. Personally, I would like to see not only NASA's open-source
tools, but also such big enterprise issues on open source and Linux. Linux
is a serious thing that runs the Internet and many serious
applications on the enterprise level. I would like to see these improvements
in your magazine.

Photo of the Month</h4><p>
I'm writing to share this magnificent Linux laptop,
which
I believe is one of the smallest around. It's a Zipit Z2, and I'm a big
fan of
it. Thanks to Johannes from Wejp.k.vu, I'm able to host my Web site on this
beauty.
