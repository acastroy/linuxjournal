A close look at the anatomy of the U-Boot environment.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c67580.0x1d5f250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Das U-Boot is a popular bootloader for embedded systems. This
wide adoption of U-Boot is hardly surprising given the number of
architectures and platforms it supports. Additionally, U-Boot has a flexible
compile-time configuration setup. You can select different features
and drivers via config options and build a custom bootloader image
for your platform. U-Boot's flexibility is extended at runtime as
well. Using U-Boot environment variables, you can influence the program
execution flow. 
</p><p>
U-Boot comes with a CLI (command-line interpreter), which
has
basic scripting capabilities. This scripting ability combined
with the U-Boot environment variables can be used to create some powerful
booting scenarios. The ability to manipulate program behavior using
environment variables is beneficial for both development and production
setups alike. During development, people strive to test all possible paths
for loading and booting images for their platforms. So, you may try to load
a Linux kernel image from a local storage (Flash, SDcard, USB, eMMC and
so on),
or access it over the network (NFS, TFTP and so on). 
</p><p>
U-Boot simply makes your life
easier as a developer. You just need to tweak the scripts combining
environment variables in a fruitful way. Production images also need
some versatility. When a product's OS images need an upgrade, the bootloader
must be configurable to fetch the images from different sources.
</p><p>
U-Boot has a number of system variables that you can modify to achieve
your desired results. For example, on certain systems, initrd images loaded
on top of DDR may not be accessible to the Linux kernel. To counter this, you
can instruct U-Boot to load initrd at a lower DDR address. You can do this
by setting the <tt  >initrd_high</tt> environment variable.
</p><p>
Another common situation
during development is the presence of different network configurations. On
your home setup, you may be working on a static IP configuration using
NFS. But, when you are out for a demo at a client location, you only
have DHCP available with images kept on a TFTP server. U-Boot is highly
configurable for such scenarios because it provides so many options.
You
can change the network configuration, modify the IP addresses of image
servers and
gateway servers with the help of environment variables.
You could assign a console over serial port, or you could use netconsole or
usbtty if you prefer.

So, What Is This U-Boot Environment?</h2></div></div><p>
A simple answer to that question would be &ldquo;a collection of name=value
pairs&rdquo;.
Here, &ldquo;name&rdquo; refers to the name of the environment variable to which
you want to assign some &ldquo;value&rdquo;. This &ldquo;value&rdquo; could be of any type:
string, hexadecimal, boolean and so forth. Whatever type the value is, it is
converted into a string before being stored in a linearized environment data
block. Each environment variable pair (&ldquo;name=value&rdquo;) would be stored as a
null-terminated string. So, the collection of many environment variables
is nothing but a null-separated list with a double-null terminator. Figure
1 illustrates how a list of strings is actually stored. The left-hand side
is just a logical representation of environment variables, whereas
the right-hand side shows that the variables have been flattened
and written in a serialized form.

How Is the Environment Stored?</h2></div></div><p>
U-Boot has two types of persistent environments.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
1) Default Environment (Compiled-In, Read-Only):</b></span>
</p><p>
Every U-Boot binary has a default built-in environment of its own (Figure
2a). During compilation, a character array called
<tt  >default_environment</tt>
is embedded into the U-Boot image. This character array stores the
environment variables as a list of null-terminated strings with a double-null terminator. The contents of this array are populated conditionally
based on the config options selected for your board. Environment variables
that are commonly used can be enabled by defining the corresponding
CONFIGs in your board's config file (include/configs/&lt;YOUR_BOARD&gt;.h).
Figure
3 lists some commonly used options, which, once defined, would make their
way into the default environment of your board.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11725f2.large.jpg"><img src="11725f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. (a) Type 1 Persistent Environment Read-Only, Embedded;
(b) Type 2 Persistent Environment User-Supplied, Read-Write Enabled
</p></div></div><p>
Apart from the standard variables used across boards, you may want to add
certain environment variables that are specific to your board or that just are
convenient for
you. You may, for instance, want to embed the revision number of the board
into this environment. You could do that by defining all of these variables
in a macro called <tt  >CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_SETTINGS</tt> in your
board's config file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#define CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_SETTINGS \
        "board=" XSTR(BOARD) "\0" \
        "load_addr=" XSTR(CONFIG_SYS_LOAD_ADDR) "\0"
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11725f3.large.jpg"><img src="11725f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. System variables defined in your board's config become part
of the default environment.
</p></div></div><p>
Remember that the default environment is &ldquo;read-only&rdquo;, as it is part
of the U-Boot image itself. Vendors normally keep some essential system
variables as part of this environment.
</p><p>
There are some good reasons to keep a default environment as part of the image:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Because it is read-only, you always have a default state to revert to.
</p></li><li><p>
During early bootup, a user-supplied environment (defined next) may be
inaccessible or must not be used due to security concerns.
</p></li><li><p>
A user-supplied environment may be inaccessible due to
a storage device malfunction or environment data corruption.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You shouldn't keep too much data in this default environment, as it
directly adds to the weight of the binary. Keep only critical system
variables in this environment.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
2) User-Supplied Environment (Flashed in External Storage,
Writable):</b></span>
</p><p>
Typically, vendors flash an environment data image to external
storage present on your board. The format of this pre-built environment
is again the same&mdash;that is, a linearized list of strings, but there is
a 4-byte
CRC header prefixed to it. This CRC is computed over the environment
data. Figure 2b illustrates such an environment blob with CRC data,
followed by valid environment data and an invalid one after that. The total
size of this environment data is fixed to
<tt  >CONFIG_ENV_SIZE</tt> during
compilation. So, if your environment usage exceeds this size, you would
need to recompile your U-Boot binary after increasing
<tt  >CONFIG_ENV_SIZE</tt>. If
you do not increase the size, U-Boot will refuse to save the environment
variables. 
</p><p>
You may decide to keep this environment in external
storage, but you must configure the board's config accordingly. U-Boot
must know which storage method (and at what offset) will be used to hold the user
environment. U-Boot provides a number of options to configure the location of
the environment data. U-Boot has the infrastructure to access environment
data stored
in serial flashes, NVRAM, NAND, dataflash, MMC and even UBI volumes. See
the U-Boot documentation for 
more information on how to use these CONFIG options.
Since the default environment size has to be
minimized, most of the environment variables are stored here. Certain
storage technologies like raw NAND flashes are inherently unreliable.
To
combat such possibilities (including power failure), and for robustness
in general, you also can configure a redundant user environment. You
can configure the location and size of this duplicate environment data
as well in your board's config.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c67580.0x1d607f8"></a>
Saving Environment</h2></div></div><p>
Out of the two default environments (default and user), only the user is
writable. So, whenever you modify a variable and issue a
<tt  >saveenv</tt>
command, that variable ends up in the user environment.
</p><p>
When you do a <tt  >saveenv</tt>, U-Boot does the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Sorts the list of current environment variables.
</p></li><li><p>
Converts them to a linearized list of strings.
</p></li><li><p>
Computes CRC over this data and burns the env back at its fixed location in storage.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c67580.0x1d60c70"></a>
Creating a Pre-Built User Environment</h2></div></div><p>
U-Boot provides a utility named <tt  >mkenvimage</tt> that can be used to generate an environment blob suitable to be flashed.
<tt  >mkenvimage</tt> needs at least two inputs to create the blob:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Environment variables in a text file (only one env
&ldquo;name=value&rdquo; string on each line).
</p></li><li><p>
The size of the environment blob in bytes (remember, this must comply with
the <tt  >CONFIG_ENV_SIZE</tt> you have defined in your board's config).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
For example, if my env data file is called my_env_data.txt, and the size of
my desired env blob is 16384 (16 KiB), I would use the following command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$./tools/mkenvimage -s 16384 -o env_blob my_env_data.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see the dump of the env blob using the <tt  >od</tt>
command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ od -t x1c env_blob

0000000  0d  d2  49  96  62  61  75  64  72  61  74  65  3d  31  31  35

This environment data blob must be flashed at the predefined offset in
the storage device. You can use U-Boot, Linux or any other flasher to
burn this blob.

Relocation of Environment Data to RAM</h2></div></div><p>
During an early boot when U-Boot has not relocated to RAM, it uses the
linearized form of environment data (as shown in Figure 1). But once U-Boot
has relocated to RAM, this linearized form is no longer used. Instead,
U-Boot imports all such env data stored from persistent storage into a
RAM-resident hashtable. If the user-supplied environment is good (that is,
the CRC is
okay), it is imported from Flash to RAM. Otherwise, U-Boot imports the
default compiled-in environment to this hashtable. Figure 4 shows how the user
environment is imported in to the hashtable, whereas U-Boot along with its
default environment relocates to top of the RAM. If the user environment
is corrupt or inaccessible, U-Boot would import the default environment
in to the hashtable.
</p><p>
The use of the RAM-resident data structure (hashtable) is important for various reasons:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
It boosts performance, as you are manipulating variables in RAM and not in Flash.
</p></li><li><p>
You have to manipulate data only in RAM and need not access some slow Flash driver (and deal with the associated complexity).
</p></li><li><p>
It allows U-Boot to deploy type checks and access control attributes on
different variables while still keeping the persistent storage form simple
(a linear list).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once the environment has relocated to RAM (into the hashtable), all
commands operating on environment variables will be working only on
this hashtable. U-Boot does not touch the environment variables stored
in the persistent storage at all (unless it needs to save the env).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11725f4.large.jpg"><img src="11725f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The user environment is imported into a hashtable. If the user environment is
corrupt, the default environment is imported instead.
</p></div></div><p>
Each environment variable entry inside the hashtable is represented
by a data structure called a <tt  >struct entry</tt> (Figure 5). Apart from
the members <tt  >key</tt> and <tt  >data</tt>, which correspond to
&ldquo;name&rdquo; and &ldquo;value&rdquo; in
the linearized representation of data, you have members called
<tt  >callback</tt> and
<tt  >flags</tt>. <tt  >flags</tt> is of integer type and is used to implement type check
and access control. <tt  >callbacks</tt> is the callback function associated with
this environment variable. If defined, this callback handler would be
invoked whenever any operation (like add, delete or modify) is performed
on this environment variable.

How to Control/React to Environment Variable Modification?</h2></div></div><p>
At times you may want to do your own runtime
configurations. You may
want to react (accept, reject or produce some side effects) to the
changes done to some environment variable. For such use cases, U-Boot
provides a mechanism of deploying callback handlers. You can associate
a callback function with an environment variable. As a first step, you
have to register a callback handler with U-Boot. This function would be
called whenever you do any modifications to the environment variable.
Figure
6 shows sample code to register a callback with U-Boot. You
can place such handler code in your board-specific file. The macro
<tt  >U_BOOT_ENV_CALLBACK</tt> registers the callback function
<tt  >on_change_foo</tt>
with the handler named <tt  >foo_h</tt>. Your handler is now registered with
U-Boot with the name &ldquo;foo&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Now, you need to establish a link to this registered handler with an
environment variable. Take a look at the struct
entry in
Figure 6.
You can see that there is a member named <tt  >callback</tt> (a function
pointer) for each environment variable. U-Boot would invoke this handler
before committing the modified environment variable to the hashtable. You can
make this association of callback handler with the environment variable either at
compile time or at runtime. For compile-time association, you need
to define the config option <tt  >#define CONFIG_ENV_CALLBACK_LIST_DEFAULT
foo:foo_h</tt> in your board's config file.
</p><p>
You also can do runtime association as depicted in Figure 7. Here I have
created a new environment variable <tt  >.callbacks</tt>, which is a standard
U-Boot system variable to make such associations. I have deployed a
handler named <tt  >foo_h</tt> for the environment variable
<tt  >foo</tt>. Once this
registration is done, whenever you do some modification to variable
<tt  >foo</tt>,
the function <tt  >on_change_foo()</tt> would be invoked. You
now can deliver your
reaction to different types of actions
(<tt  >env_op_create</tt>,
<tt  >env_op_overwrite</tt> or
<tt  >env_op_delete</tt>).
</p><p>
U-Boot already deploys similar handlers for managing console changes,
splash images and so on.

Type and Access Control of Environment Variables</h2></div></div><p>
There are certain environment variables that you want to use but do
not want to do casual modifications. For example, say you have an environment
variable <tt  >serial#</tt>; you definitely want this variable
to be read-only, and you
want automatic rejection of any attempt to change it. Another such
example is the MAC address of the device. Again, you want to keep that
variable as read-only or, at worst, write-once. U-Boot supports different
access modifiers: <tt  >any</tt>,
<tt  >read-only</tt>,
<tt  >write-once</tt> and <tt  >change-default</tt>
(Figure 5). The U-Boot hashtable representation of environment variables has a
member <tt  >int flags</tt> (Figure 5). The member
<tt  >flags</tt> is used to keep a bitmap
specifying the access permission associated with variable. So, whenever
any modification attempt is done on variable, it must comply with the
access permission; otherwise, U-Boot will reject the changes.
</p><p>
Another problem faced by users is the basic sanity check of environment
variable type. Since the linearized form of environment keeps only strings,
U-Boot needs to make sure that it can do some kind of type check before
assigning a value to a variable. To address this issue, U-Boot makes use of
some predefined types, such as &ldquo;string&rdquo;,
&ldquo;decimal&rdquo;, &ldquo;hexadecimal&rdquo;, &ldquo;boolean&rdquo;,
&ldquo;IP address&rdquo; and &ldquo;MAC address&rdquo;. There are corresponding codes for these type
modifiers: &ldquo;s&rdquo;, &ldquo;d&rdquo;, &ldquo;x&rdquo;,
&ldquo;b&rdquo;, &ldquo;i&rdquo; and &ldquo;m&rdquo;. Again, U-Boot stores this type
information of variables in <tt  >flags</tt> as a bitmap (Figure 5).
</p><p>
You can associate &ldquo;type&rdquo; and &ldquo;access control&rdquo; to a variable either
at compile time or at runtime. For compile-time association, you need
to define a config <tt  >#define CONFIG_ENV_FLAGS_LIST_DEFAULT
foo:sr</tt> in
your board file. For runtime association, you can define an environment
variable <tt  >.flags</tt> (Figure 8). Here, I am associating an environment variable
<tt  >foo</tt> with type <tt  >s</tt> (meaning the value is a
string) and access control <tt  >r</tt>
(meaning it is read-only). Once deployed, if you try to modify the variable
<tt  >foo</tt>, U-Boot will reject your request. Also, if a value is not of
specified &ldquo;type&rdquo;, your update to the environment variable will fail.
</p><p>
Environment variables like MAC address make use of type
<tt  >m</tt>.
This will
make U-Boot do a sanity check on the value entered by the user to confirm
whether the value is indeed a valid MAC address.

Modifying the U-Boot User Environment from Linux</h2></div></div><p>
U-Boot environment variables can be added, modified or deleted from
Linux as well. U-Boot provides a set of utilities called
<tt  >fw_printenv</tt> and
<tt  >fw_setenv</tt> to do the job. First, you need to compile these utilities for
Linux. Figure 9 shows the compilation steps for the utility. Here, I am
cross-compiling it for the ARM platform. It is a multi-call binary. So,
you need to make a symlink named <tt  >fw_setenv</tt> to the binary
<tt  >fw_printenv</tt>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11725f9.large.jpg"><img src="11725f9.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. Compiling fw_printenv/fw_setenv for an armv7 Host
</p></div></div><p>
To modify the environment, you first need to boot in to Linux on the
target board. Next, you need to create a file called /etc/fw_env.config. This
file contains all the information needed to specify the location of
the environment data blob. Figure 10 shows my configuration file. I kept my
environment in an SPI Flash, which appeared as /dev/mtd0 to my kernel. My
environment blob was configured at an offset of 0x80000 from the beginning
of Flash and had a size of 0x40000. The size of each sector of my Flash
is 0x10000. This is all the information I needed to provide in order for
the environment manipulation utilities to work.
</p><p>
As soon as I keyed in the command <tt  >fw_printenv</tt>, I could see the variables
that I saved in the U-Boot user environment appearing on my console.
</p><p>
You also can set the environment variables using
<tt  >fw_setenv</tt>. As shown
in Figure 10, I make use of a text file (list.txt) containing the variables
I want to set. The format is simple. The first whitespace after a name
acts as a delimiter, and the characters until the end of line thereafter are
considered the value for the key.
</p><p>
You can verify that the variables have been set by executing
<tt  >fw_printenv</tt>. These variables now would be visible from U-Boot as well.

Restoring the Default Environment</h2></div></div><p>
Sometimes after a lot of environment variable changes, you can corrupt
the state. To restore sanity and get the original values of the default
environment, you can use the <tt  >env</tt> command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
env default [-f] var [...] 
</pre>
</p><p>
The above command would forcibly reset the specified variables to a value
from the default environment.
</p><p>
To restore the complete environment from the default, invoke the
following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
env default -a
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >env</tt> command is very powerful; you can use it import/export environment
data from/to RAM.
