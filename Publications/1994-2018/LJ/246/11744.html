Sometimes a gift just falls in your lap. This month, it came in the form of an
e-mail out of the blue from Jared Nielsen, one of two brothers (the other
is J.R. Nielsen) who created The
Hello World Program, &ldquo;an educational web series making computer science fun and
accessible to all&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.thehelloworldprogram.com" target="_self">www.thehelloworldprogram.com</a>). If it had been just that, I might not have been interested.
</p><p>
But when I looked at it, I saw it was hugely about Linux. And the human story
was interesting too. Wrote Jared, &ldquo;Working in rural Utah with minimal resources,
we combine technology and craft to make educational yet entertaining videos and
tutorials. Learn to code with our cute and clever puppets.&rdquo; So I said I'd like
to interview them, and here's how it went.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: What got you going on this?</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: Growing up, we wanted to be making creative media, such as games, videos,
animations, etc., but in the days before the Internet, training was either
difficult or expensive to find, especially in small-town Utah. We figured things
out on our own, through trial and error, visits to the library and countless
hours watching PBS. The Hello World Program is the show we wish we watched as
kids.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Do you or your brother have kids yourselves?</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: Neither of us have kids, but we are both kids at heart.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: How long have you been doing it?</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: We started kicking around ideas for an educational Web series in January
2012. Then we sat on our hands for a few months. We published our first video,
&ldquo;What Is a Robot?&rdquo; in May of that year. Since then, The Hello World
Program has significantly evolved. We introduced several new characters and
expanded our scope to include Web development and programming.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Where in rural Utah are you? (A side thing&mdash;I love Utah and have shot it a
lot from the air:
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=Utah&amp;user_id=52614599%40N00&amp;sort=interestingness-desc" target="_self">https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=Utah&amp;user_id=52614599%40N00&amp;sort=interestingness-desc</a>.)</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: Our home is Richfield, the gateway to adventure in Southern Utah.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Cool! I shot your house from the sky just this past May 4th, in fact. (Here
it is:
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/14861798514/in/set-72157646284287131" target="_self">https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/14861798514/in/set-72157646284287131</a>).</em></span>
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>So, why Linux? We love Linux here, but not all computer science education starts
with Linux, especially for kids. But you started there, which is very
cool.</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: Linux is the future! So we hope. Between the two poles of servers and
smartphones&mdash;and the ubiquity of computers&mdash;we think the majority of users
will eventually run a Linux distribution. One of our goals is to remove the
economic barrier associated with learning computer science. Not only are the
majority of Linux distros free, they are amazingly powerful and customizable and
can breathe new life into old hardware.
</p><p>
Linux is also very hands-on, and learning it is also learning how a computer
works. Other popular operating systems obscure the inner workings of the
computer from the user. With Linux, students can choose how deep they
want to dive into their machines.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: And you do all your production on Linux?</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: Yes. We have such an appreciation for this operating system that we challenged
ourselves to produce all of our media using Linux machines. We edit our videos
with Lightworks (<a href="http://www.lwks.com" target="_self">www.lwks.com</a>). Our computer graphics are rendered in
Blender (<a href="http://www.blender.org" target="_self">www.blender.org</a>). Our audio is
processed using Audacity (<a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net" target="_self">audacity.sourceforge.net</a>) and Ardour
(<a href="https://ardour.org" target="_self">https://ardour.org</a>), and our stopmotion animations are created
using Entangle (<a href="http://entangle-photo.org" target="_self">entangle-photo.org</a>) and compiled with avconv
(<a href="https://libav.org/avconv.html" target="_self">https://libav.org/avconv.html</a>).
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Why puppets? (Side thing&mdash;my daughter Colette is a college professor who
teaches puppet theater:
<a href="http://www.umbc.edu/theatre/searls.html" target="_self">www.umbc.edu/theatre/searls.html</a>.)</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: We learned about the world by watching <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sesame Street</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Muppets</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mr. Rogers'
Neighborhood</em></span>. We wanted to create a show in the same vein with a contemporary
sensibility. We loved the idea of merging analog craft with digital technology.
In addition to puppets, a lot of our new content features stopmotion and
hand-drawn animation as well as 3-D computer-generated animation.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Why Python? We can guess, but we'd rather ask anyway.</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: Python is an excellent choice for a beginner because it issues immediate
results, it's very easy to read, and it can be used for a wide variety of
applications. Best of all, it is included with most Linux distributions.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Do you teach locally as well as on-line (for example, in local
schools)? If
so, how and where?</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: We ran workshops with hacker/Makerspaces in the past, but found that our
two-man
team didn't have the time and resources necessary to teach and continue
producing new content for our site.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Do you have commercial or other ambitions besides what you're doing now?
(Such as seeing these adopted in schools?)</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: We would love to see our curriculum adopted in schools, though our ambitions are
more autodidactic. Our primary goal is to empower young people to make their own
media.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Do you have a business with this as well?</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: Yes. We're bundling our videos and selling them as a digital download. Our first
complete segment, Daisy's Web Dev Diary, is available for purchase via Gumroad
(<a href="https://gumroad.com/l/daisy" target="_self">https://gumroad.com/l/daisy</a>).
</p><p>
We're also planning to release e-books for each of the four tracks of The Hello
World Program. And we're slowly building a merchandise store, for fans to
purchase Hello World-themed T-shirts, stickers and posters
(<a href="http://www.zazzle.com/dototot" target="_self">www.zazzle.com/dototot</a>).
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: You identify on Twitter as a &ldquo;Creative media company and think
tank&rdquo;
(<a href="https://twitter.com/dotototdotcom" target="_self">https://twitter.com/dotototdotcom</a>). Tell
us more about both (especially the think tank part).</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: The Hello World Program is our first project. As a creative media company, we
are producing an educational and entertaining series of videos and tutorials
combining art and technology. As a think tank, we recognize that understanding
the basics of computer science will be a necessary skill set for the future.
Through STEM initiatives, technological literacy will be taught to students at a
younger age and eventually incorporated in standard curriculum. We're predicting
that Linux and Python will be at the forefront of this movement. We support an
open-source future and consider our current project a contribution to furthering
the cause.
</p><p>
Otherwise, we're perpetually brainstorming new endeavors beyond puppets and
video. But we're not ready to talk about them yet.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Can you give us some success stories with kids?</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: Our booth at Maker Faire Bay Area 2013 was wildly successful. It was titled
&ldquo;Robot Puppet Party&rdquo;, and we invited young makers to use our puppets to
create their own short videos. We were awarded two Editor's Choice blue ribbons.
But more important, the kids loved it.
</p><p>
We're also launching an Indiegogo campaign called &ldquo;Hands-On Computer Science:
The Hello World Program&rdquo;, which should go up in September (<a href="http://igg.me/at/hello-world" target="_self">igg.me/at/hello-world</a>).
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Good. That's just in advance of this issue of the magazine. Any other
projects?</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: We're launching a new segment, &ldquo;Superusers: The Legendary GNU/Linux
Show&rdquo;
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQbODhkyA4g&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_self">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQbODhkyA4g&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>).
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Excellent! I like Aramis the Gnu and Adalie the penguin!</em></span>
</p><p>
JN: We're also launching a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo that should be up by
the time you read this.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Where can readers follow you?</em></span>
</p><p>
