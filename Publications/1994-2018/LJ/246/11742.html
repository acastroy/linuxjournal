<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #246, October 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Kernel configuration has become more and
more complex through the years with
the proliferation of new drivers, new hardware and specific behaviors that
might be needed for particular uses. It has reached about 3,000 <span   class="bold"><b>config
options</b></span>, and that number will only increase.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jean Delvare</b></span> recently pointed out that a lot of those config options were
relevant only to particular hardware, and yet the config system presented
them to users who didn't have that hardware. This seemed like a bug to him,
and he suggested that maintainers begin requiring proper hardware
dependencies for all config options.
</p><p>
He acknowledged this would be a big task&mdash;especially for existing drivers.
But creating the requirement for new drivers would at least get the ball
rolling, and older drivers could follow along more gradually.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Josh Boyer</b></span> agreed with all this. From his
work on the <span   class="bold"><b>Fedora</b></span> project, he
had to deal with the config system intensively, and he found it difficult. He
said, &ldquo;I've gotten to the point where I can somewhat guess based on the
driver name which arch it's for (lately the majority are for ARM), but that
isn't really a great way to handle things.&rdquo;
</p><p>
There was some resistance to the idea. <span   class="bold"><b>Greg
Kroah-Hartman</b></span>, in particular,
suggested that there were existing alternatives. For example, he said
users simply could compile everything as modules. Then, they'd be
loaded into the system only as needed.
</p><p>
But, neither Jean nor Josh liked that suggestion. Jean said that in the old
days it was fine to build everything as a module, but nowadays there were
just too many modules, and that &ldquo;Saying 'm' to everything increases build
times beyond reason. You also hit build failures you shouldn't have to care
about, depmod takes forever, updates are slow as hell. This is the problem
I am trying to solve.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Greg didn't see how build times could be a problem. Building the kernel on
his laptop, he said, took about 20 minutes&mdash;with all 3,000 modules compiled
in. If that wasn't good enough, he suggested upgrading the hardware to get
a faster build time.
</p><p>
But, Jean said this wasn't a practical solution for some cases. He said,
&ldquo;We
have 34 kernel flavors for openSUSE 13.1, for example. And, every commit
potentially triggers a rebuild of the whole set, to catch regressions as
fast as possible. So every module we build, for no good reason, gets built a
hundred times each day.&rdquo; He added that it would cost a lot of money to
upgrade the hardware underneath that build system.
</p><p>
Greg said he understood the issue, but that fixing the config system was
just a hard problem to solve. It boiled down to enforcing better habits on
everyone producing patches. He said, &ldquo;If you see new drivers show up that
you don't know where they work on, ask the developers and make up
patches.&rdquo;
He added, &ldquo;Perhaps a few developers could be auditing the new
<span   class="bold"><b>Kconfig</b></span> items
of every kernel around -rc3 time frame to ensure that they don't do stuff
like this.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Jean said that -rc3 would be too late, because &ldquo;all kernel developers and
distributions have already moved to the new kernel so they have already
answered the n/m/y question for all new entries.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;It's the
reviewer's job to refuse new drivers with bad Kconfig descriptions in the
first place. This must happen as early as possible in the chain.&rdquo;
</p><p>
No clear decision came out of the discussion, but it does seem as though
there's a vast mountain of configuration options that are becoming more and
more difficult to deal with. Eventually, I think some form of clean
hardware dependencies will end up being implemented, along the lines of
Jean's suggestion.
</p><p>
With all the new devices coming out on the market, there's a big desire to
get Linux running properly on all of them. Things like <span   class="bold"><b>Intel's Quark</b></span> system
use only a few MB of RAM and have other tight hardware requirements.
Shrinking Linux down to the right size poses a challenge.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Andi Kleen</b></span> recently pointed out,
&ldquo;One problem on these small systems is the
size of the network stack. Currently enabling IPv4 costs about
400k.&rdquo; He
wanted to give users the option to prune down the Linux networking stack to
only the bare essentials and get it down to 100K per
application&mdash;competitive with <span   class="bold"><b>Adam Dunkel's
LwIP</b></span> (Lightweight IP) project.
</p><p>
Andi posted some patches to create three available options for the
networking stack: a full system with all current features, a partial
system that supported regular users but not servers or a minimal
networking system for the special userland on deeply embedded systems. The
minimal system, he said, would &ldquo;remove rtnetlink (ioctl only), remove
ethtool, raw sockets&rdquo;.
</p><p>
This seemed extreme to <span   class="bold"><b>Richard Weinberger</b></span>, who said that on such a minimal
system, even the <tt  >ps</tt> command wouldn't work. <span   class="bold"><b>Tom Zanussi</b></span> on the other hand,
said that the <span   class="bold"><b>microYocto</b></span> Linux
distribution ran okay with Andi's patches and
had decent workarounds to keep <tt  >ps</tt> working properly.
But, he added that
microYocto was &ldquo;very much a work-in-progress with a lot of rough edges, but
it is a fully functional system on real hardware&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alexei Starovoitov</b></span> felt that trying to support such a minimal system would
only create config options that led to a hacky, work-in-progress,
rough-edged system. He said that if the goal was to create a
half-functional system that was just very very small, the same thing could
be accomplished with linker hacks. Simply &ldquo;compile kernel as-is. Most
functions have a stub for mcount() already. Use it to track whether the kernel
function was called or not. Collect this data in userspace (as perf already
does), add a few more functions that had a 'notrace' attribute on them, and
feed this into a special linker that unpacks existing vmlinux, throws away
cold functions, relocates the rest and here you have tiny vmlinux without
recompilation.&rdquo;
</p><p>
But, Andi pointed out that for networking code, this wouldn't really work.
He objected, &ldquo;How would you know you exercised all the corner cases in the
TCP stack? And you wouldn't want a remotely exploitable system because some
important error handler is missing.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The discussion ended inconclusively. But, it does seem as though real
patches, and not linker hacks, will be used to support all new
hardware&mdash;even the tiny hardware that's been coming out lately.

Controlling a remote computer is something you're all familiar
with. Whether that means RDP to your corporate Windows Server (we don't
judge), Apple Remote Desktop (which is really VNC) to your OS X machine or
VNC/X11/etc. into your GUI Linux machine, it's always a pain in the rear.
</p><p>
The folks at Google are trying to make it a little easier with Chrome
Remote Desktop. It's a combination of Chrome browser app and native
binary that runs on your client machines. Once the d&aelig;mon is installed,
you can access the computer remotely from anywhere, including a really
cool Android app. The combination of available platforms is pretty
impressive too:
</p><p>
Server platform (what can be controlled):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Windows
</p></li><li><p>
OS X
</p></li><li><p>
Linux (Beta, Ubuntu/Debian for now)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Client platforms (what can be used to control the systems above):
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Windows
</p></li><li><p>
OS X
</p></li><li><p>
Linux
</p></li><li><p>
Android
</p></li><li><p>
iOS (coming soon, supposedly)
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11742androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11742androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Permissions on the d&aelig;mon can be customized for 
controlling your own computer remotely (no local permission required) or
for allowing other people in to assist you. The latter is preferred to avoid anyone
barging in on your work session. The d&aelig;mon is available for Windows
and OS X, and recently they released a beta version of the d&aelig;mon for
Ubuntu/Debian Linux! Thanks to its wonderful cross-platform approach
and smooth functionality in our testing, Chrome Remote Desktop
earns this month's Editors' Choice award! Check it out today at

Sometimes, when the clock hits 3:00am, and you've been in the server
room since 9 o'clock the previous day, you start to get a little
batty. That's the only explanation I have for programs like cowsay
in Linux. Still, I'm glad they're there, because life wouldn't be nearly
as fun without them. Here's a quick list of silly Linux programs off the
top of my head. I'd love to hear about more, so please, send me your
crazy Linux Easter eggs, and I'll follow up on the Web site showing off
the best ones.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11742cowsayf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
cowsay: install this program, and the cow will say whatever you ask
it to. (Bonus: there's a GUI version of cowsay too, called xcowsay!)
</p></li><li><p>
sl: this is a program I like to install, because it makes fun of you
when you accidentally type <tt  >sl</tt> instead of
<tt  >ls</tt>&mdash;a steam locomotive
chugs across the screen. (It also shows up if you press caps lock, and
type <tt  >LS</tt>!)
</p></li><li><p>
cmatrix: blue pill or red pill, this little program will suck you
in to the Matrix either way! (Leaving <span   class="emphasis"><em>this</em></span> matrix just requires a Ctrl-C,
thankfully.)
</p></li><li><p>
libaa-bin: install this package, and then type <tt  >aafire</tt> to stoke up
the ASCII flame. Grab your digital marshmallows!
</p></li><li><p>
Star Wars: open a terminal and type <tt  >telnet
towel.blinkenlights.nl</tt>,
and grab some popcorn. Or maybe roast some of those digital marshmallows,
because you can watch the entire <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars</em></span> movie in a terminal window.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Most of these silly things have been around for years and years, but
every so often, I learn of one I never knew about before. Send me your
favorites, and I'll be sure you get credit for slacking off at work&mdash;er,
I mean for discovering awesomeness! E-mail

<h2 class="title">EdgeRouter Lite</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #246, October 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In the September 2014 issue, I mentioned my new router, and I got a lot of e-mail messages asking
about how well it works. I can say without hesitation it's the nicest
router I've ever owned. And, it was less than $100!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11742edgef1.large.jpg"><img src="11742edgef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The EdgeRouter Lite is a business-class router based on the open-source
Vyatta system. It has been forked, and as it matures, it will become less
and less like the original Vyatta code, but for the present, it works
much the same. I purchased the EdgeRouter because my old ATOM-based
ClearOS router/firewall couldn't keep up with the traffic from my home
network. My favorite features include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Three GigE ports, each routable separately.
</p></li><li><p>
A claimed one million packets per second throughput.
</p></li><li><p>
Wire-speed routing.
</p></li><li><p>
Advanced configuration possible.
</p></li><li><p>
Price!
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I'll admit, setting up the EdgeRouter Lite was a pain in the rear end. The
basics can be done via the Web interface, but if you want any QOS for
your connection, it will be a learning experience trying to figure out the
Vyatta command and code (and concepts!) for doing so. It took me three or
four hours
to get the setup that I'm happy with, and since then, I haven't touched
it&mdash;at all. It works so fast, I never notice it, and it's been rock-solid
since day one. If you're looking for an advanced router, but don't want
to break the bank, the EdgeRouter Lite might be exactly what you're
need. Be warned, however, its setup is not for the faint of heart.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Remember Burning ISOs?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #246, October 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I was chatting with a Windows-using friend recently, and he wanted to
try Linux on one of his older computers. I always like those sorts of
conversations, and so I kept chatting, walking him through setting up
Unetbootin to create a USB installer and so on and so on. Unfortunately, he wasn't
able to get the USB drive to boot. Since we were half a country apart,
I couldn't troubleshoot locally, so we moved on to burning a CD/DVD.
</p><p>
My first instinct was to have him download the incredible
InfraRecorder. Unfortunately, there seems to be a malware-infected version
of InfraRecorder going around, and of course, that's the download link he
found. So, be sure to send folks directly to <a href="http://infrarecorder.org" target="_self">infrarecorder.org</a>
to download it.

</p></div></div><p>
Alternatively, I'm a big fan of the free-but-not-free program ImgBurn
as well. It's not open source, but it is freeware, and it has a very simple
interface. Either way you go, be sure to warn potential Linux converts
about the malware masquerading as open-source software. Remember to
send people directly to the Web site rather than having them
&ldquo;google&rdquo;
for it. The open-source InfraRecorder is at <a href="http://infrarecorder.org" target="_self">infrarecorder.org</a>,
and the freeware ImgBurn is at <a href="http://www.imgburn.com" target="_self">www.imgburn.com</a>. Once they switch to
Linux, everything they need will be an <tt  >apt-get</tt> or
<tt  >yum</tt> away!

<h2 class="title">What's Happening above Your Head?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #246, October 2014</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In the past, I've covered various astronomy packages that help you
explore the universe of deep space. But, space starts a lot closer to
home. It actually begins a few hundred miles above your head. There are
lots of things in orbit right above you. In this article, I look at one
of the tools available to help you track the satellites that are whizzing
around the Earth: Gpredict (<a href="http://gpredict.oz9aec.net/index.php" target="_self">gpredict.oz9aec.net/index.php</a>). 
</p><p>
A package should be available in most
Linux distributions. In Debian-based ones, you can install Gpredict with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install gpredict
</pre>
</p><p>
This is usually a version or two behind the latest, so if you want to have
the newest options, you always can download and build from source. 
</p><p>
Once you
have it installed, you can start it with the 
<tt  >gpredict</tt> command. When it
opens, you should see the main window, with a sample layout given by
the module named &ldquo;Amateur&rdquo; (Figure 1). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11742gpredictf1.large.jpg"><img src="11742gpredictf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When Gpredict first starts, you get an initial module
called Amateur.
</p></div></div><p>
In the rest of this article,
I take a look at all the various possible layouts and show just
how much information is available to you.
</p><p>
The core concept in Gpredict is that of the module. You can think of modules 
as documents in a word processor. They are containers you can use
to hold a number of other layout objects that display satellite
information in a number of different ways. 
</p><p>
When you first start Gpredict,
you get the default Amateur module, which contains a map view,
a polar view and a single satellite view. For some of these views,
you may notice a small down-arrow in one of the top corners. Clicking
this icon gives you an appropriate drop-down list of options. For
example, clicking the down-arrow in the map view gives you a list of
items, such as detaching the module or configuring it (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11742gpredictf2.large.jpg"><img src="11742gpredictf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Some views have drop-down lists of options.
</p></div></div><p>
The map view offers a map of the Earth, with a series of satellites
and their footprints on the Earth. When you hover over one of the
satellites, you will see an information box with the satellite's detailed
location. The single satellite view provides even more detail about one
specific satellite. You can select which satellite is being displayed
by clicking on the down-arrow in the view. 
The polar view provides an
overhead look, located at the ground station. 
</p><p>
In the Amateur module,
you get one ground station called &ldquo;sample&rdquo;. You can add more
ground stations
by clicking the down-arrow and selecting configuration (Figure 3).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11742gpredictf3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can set the configuration details for the map view here.
</p></div></div><p>
You can add another ground station by clicking the plus sign. This will pop
up a details window where you can enter a name and the location data for your
ground station (Figure 4). For the location, you can enter
the latitude and longitude manually, or if you live in a major city, you
can select it from a global list of locations. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11742gpredictf4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can add a ground station with details here.
</p></div></div><p>
One other item you will
notice when you have the configuration window open is that you
can select which satellites are displayed. This list is rather
large, but there is nothing stopping you from adding all of them to your
module. It might make the display a tad crowded, but it still should work.
</p><p>
I should take a step back at this point and describe some other
configuration options available. The first option to look at is the
menu item Edit&rarr;Update TLE. This option lets you update the Keplerian
elements for the satellites. You can update them either from the network
or from a local file. The default configuration is set up to remind
you when the TLE data is likely out of date. You then can go ahead
and update this data. For an update over the network, the default
configuration is to download NORAD data from <a href="http://www.celestrak.com" target="_self">www.celestrak.com</a>. For a tutorial on the format for TLE
data, visit
<a href="http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/tools/keps_tutorial.php" target="_self">www.amsat.org/amsat-new/tools/keps_tutorial.php</a>.
</p><p>
All
the other configuration options are available under the menu item
Edit&rarr;Preferences (Figure 5). Here, you can change options like
the number formats used or the geographical coordinates. There also is a
tab for ground stations, where you can edit or add ground stations. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11742gpredictf5.large.jpg"><img src="11742gpredictf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The preferences window lets you change all sorts of options.
</p></div></div><p>
The
modules section lets you change configuration options used in the display
of the Gpredict modules. You can change things like the refresh rate for
the displays or what map to use as the background for the map view. You
also can select what type of layout you want for a particular module. When
you select a new layout, you will see a preview of what it will look
like in the preferences window. There are nine different pre-generated
layouts available, or you can create a custom layout. When you select
the custom layout, you define what it will look like by entering the
layout code. See the user manual for details on how to define a code to create the layout you
want.
</p><p>
Gpredict also has the ability to control radios and
rotators. The key to this is the hamlib library. By using this library,
Gpredict can handle Doppler tuning of radios and tracking of antenna
rotators. When you want to connect hardware to your computer, you
should verify that hamlib can talk to it successfully. Once you have
made sure everything is working correctly, you can set up Gpredict
to talk to your hardware. This is handled in the interfaces section of
the preferences window. There are two tabs, one for radios and one for
rotators. Since hamlib communicates over network protocols, the radio
or rotator doesn't even need to be connected to the same machine. You
can define one of these pieces of hardware with a hostname, a port and
the communication details. Once you have the hardware configured,
you can control it by pulling up the radio control window, which you access
by clicking the down-arrow in the map view and selecting
Radio Control (Figure 6). You can see the details of the downlink and
uplink, as well as information about targets.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11742gpredictf6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You can control radios and antenna rotators that are defined in Gpredict.
</p></div></div><p>
Now that you know how to get satellite information for what is moving
above your head, you should be able to go outside and do some actual
observations and see all of the man-made objects travelling around. It
can be inspiring to see how much we already do in space, and how much
more we could be doing.
