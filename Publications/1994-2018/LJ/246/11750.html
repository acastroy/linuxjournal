Firewalls are great, but don't rely on them as your only network security!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f6580.0x16ee358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've written about SSH before&mdash;often even. But for the Linux user, SSH
is one of those tools that is so incredibly flexible, everyone should
know and understand it inside and out. For this article, I decided to put on
my black hat and demonstrate how convenient, and terrifying, SSH can be.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f6580.0x16ee510"></a>
Phone Home</h2></div></div><p>
Most articles on SSH start with forwarding X11 traffic or demonstrating
the SOCKS proxy feature. I want to start with something a little more
creepy and a whole lot more awesome. The premise is this: you have a
computer inside a firewalled, NAT'd network, and you want to access it
remotely. If you're the sysadmin, you can just forward a port on the
firewall into the computer. If you're not, however, you can use SSH to
open a tunnel for you automatically. This does require a few things:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
You need a server running SSH with a public IP address. I use my
co-located Raspberry Pi in Austria, but you can use your home connection
as long as you set up a Dynamic DNS entry in case your IP changes.
</p></li><li><p>
The firewalled network has to allow outgoing SSH connections. Most do,
but if you can't SSH out from inside the firewall, you might have to do
something creative like run SSH on port 443 on your server. (That port
is usually open for HTTPS traffic, and since it's encrypted, it's tougher
to sniff out your naughty deeds.)
</p></li><li><p>
You need key pairs set up for password-less logins from the
computer inside the firewall to your server with the public
IP. (Here's a demo I did back in 2009 on how to set up SSH key pairs:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R65HTJeObkI" target="_self">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R65HTJeObkI</a>.)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once you have the prerequisites in place, the process is a simple
one-liner. First, the command, then the explanation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -N -R 0.0.0.0:2222:127.0.0.1:22 user@remotehost
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >-N</tt> flag tells SSH that you don't want an
interactive shell; you
just want to establish the connection. That means in order to take the
tunnel down, you simply press Ctrl-C. It can become confusing if you have an
open terminal connected interactively to a remote server. The tunneling
still will work, but if you inadvertently type <tt  >exit</tt>, it logs you out
and kills the tunnel.
</p><p>
The <tt  >-R 0.0.0.0:2222:127.0.0.1:22</tt> portion of the command is where
the magic happens. What you're doing is creating a reverse tunnel,
which allows anyone who can access your public IP server to
<tt  >ssh</tt> in to
the server behind the firewall. In English, the command is saying,
&ldquo;Hi remote server, I'm stuck behind a firewall. Will you listen on port
2222 for anyone trying to connect, and if they do, please forward the
traffic to me on my port 22.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The command can get creepier too. In my example, I just forwarded
traffic to the public port 2222 to the internal port 22 behind the
firewall. But if you were to change the command like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -N -R 0.0.0.0:3389:192.168.1.5:3389 user@remotehost
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f6580.0x16eed50"></a></h2></div></div><p>
You've now created a public-access tunnel directly to the Windows RDP
server on 192.168.1.5 behind the firewall. Anyone on the Internet who
connects their RDP client to the remote host's IP address will get the
RDP login screen from 192.168.1.5. Freaked out yet?
</p><p>
One of the problems with this setup is the relative instability of the
Internet. If the SSH connection is severed, the tunnel collapses, and
you no longer can reach the computer inside the firewall. Thankfully,
there's a really great tool to help with that too: AutoSSH.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f6580.0x16eeeb0"></a>
AutoSSH</h2></div></div><p>
Having a diabolical tunnel to an internal network across the globe is
only awesome until it stops working. SSH is a finicky protocol, so the
smallest blip over the Internet can cause the connection to fail. If
you launch the SSH command with AutoSSH, however, it will monitor your
connection and restart it if things go wrong. AutoSSH will keep trying
too, so even if the network is down for an extended time, when it comes
back up, the SSH connection will be re-established.
</p><p>
AutoSSH is available for just about every major distribution, but it
has to be installed on the computer <span   class="emphasis"><em>inside</em></span> the
firewall, because that's
where the connection has to initiate from. How I do it is basically put
something like this in my crontab to run on @reboot:


<pre     class="programlisting">
autossh -M 41000 -f -N -R 0.0.0.0:2222:127.0.0.1:22 user@remotehost
</pre>
</p><p>
Only two of the flags are for AutoSSH; the others get handed off to
SSH itself. Basically, the <tt  >-M 41000</tt> establishes a monitor port for
AutoSSH to use. It's possible to use SSH's built-in ability to monitor a
connection, but I've had very bad luck with it. Using AutoSSH's
<tt  >-M</tt> flag
seems to work the best. It doesn't matter what port you select, as long
as it's not currently in use on either computer. The next flag,
<tt  >-f</tt>, just
tells AutoSSH to run in the background and monitor the connection. The
rest of the line is similar to what I showed typed above.
</p><p>
I used to write complex bash scripts to check for connectivity, and kill
off then restart SSH, but using AutoSSH is much more efficient and
reliable. I've been using it for years, and it is rock-solid. The most
I've ever had to do is kill off defunct SSH connections on the public
server if for some reason I can't connect. AutoSSH then happily creates
a new connection, and I'm back in business.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f6580.0x16ef380"></a>
What Good Is It?</h2></div></div><p>
I personally use this sort of setup to access internal servers that
aren't accessible directly from the Internet. I don't like to open ports
directly into internal servers if possible, so if I can grant myself
access to multiple internal servers by SSH'ing to a remote, unrelated
IP on a random port, I feel a little better about it.
</p><p>
I also use this sort of setup to expose multiple Web servers from inside
a network to the outside. Figure 1 shows the basic premise. The command
looks similar to the example above, but with multiple
<tt  >-R</tt> flags.


<pre     class="programlisting">
autossh -M 41000 -f -N -R 0.0.0.0:8001:192.168.1.10:80 \ 
-R 0.0.0.0:8002:192.168.1.20:80 user@remotehost
</pre>
</p><p>
To note, that's all on one line, I just used the backslash so it
formats better. Basically, by using multiple SSH reverse tunnels (the
<tt  >-R</tt>
flags), internal Web servers are accessible by pointing the browser to
http://remotehost:8001, http://remotehost:8002 and so on. I then use a reverse
proxy (see my column in the August 2013 issue for details) to connect to those
strange URLs with standard virtual hostnames. SSH is such a powerful,
flexible tool, that its uses are seemingly unlimited! With that great
power comes great responsibility though, because SSH allows you to do
some pretty creepy things.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11750f1.large.jpg"><img src="11750f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Although there's a lot going on behind the scenes, an end user 
accessing the virtual hosts on the left just sees a Web server.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15f6580.0x16ef850"></a>
Even Scarier!</h2></div></div><p>
You may have noticed that using an SSH tunnel provides you
only with specific access to specific ports spelled out with the tunnel
directives. It is possible to pass multiple <tt  >-R</tt> flags, but it's tough
to do that on the fly, because the command is performed on the computer
inside the firewall. If you need to access the entire network behind
the firewall, that's where sshuttle comes into play.
</p><p>
I've mentioned sshuttle in past issues of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>, but when used
in conjunction with the tunnels I just described how to create, it turns
into something that should be impossible, but isn't. Once you have the
reverse tunnel established, using the processes above, the command to
get you access to the entire firewalled network is another one-liner:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sshuttle -D -r user@remotehost:2222 192.168.1.0/24
</pre>
</p><p>
As a reminder, this runs on your home workstation, not on the computer
behind the corporate firewall. (See Figure 2 for a complete picture.)
The <tt  >-D</tt> flag tells sshuttle to run as a d&aelig;mon in the background. The
<tt  >-r</tt> flag tells it what remote server to connect
through&mdash;in this case,
user@remotehost on port 2222. Then the last part describes the internal
network behind the firewall. This is something you'll need to know
or figure out from your internal workstation. It will ask you for your
sudo password, and then establish a network route through the SSH tunnel.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11750f2.large.jpg"><img src="11750f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Using SSH tunnels and sshuttle together can provide an
incredibly scary level of network access from outside the firewall.
</p></div></div><p>
Basically, you've now not only accessed the workstation inside the
firewall, but you have full access to anything that workstation has
access to as well&mdash;from anywhere on the Internet.

We're All Doomed!</h2></div></div><p>
If you are feeling a bit like the nerdy hero in a modern espionage
film, well yeah, I get it. There are some legitimate reasons to create
tunnels like this, although admittedly an actual VPN is usually the
&ldquo;proper&rdquo; way to go about it. It's important for those of us in charge of
networks to realize how easy it is to gain access to internal systems,
however. It's possible to block access like this at the firewall level,
but honestly, there's always ways around the firewall if you're able to
initiate internally. Plus, using draconian blocking methods will just
inconvenience your users to the point of making them revolt. So what's a
network admin to do?
</p><p>
Obviously, learning about network security is crucial. The reasons VLANs
and NAC (network access control) systems exist is to prevent undesired
access to various systems. When you're designing or redesigning
your network, don't assume an external firewall will protect you from
computers outside your network. Disgruntled employees, malware victims
or nerdy employees like me will find a way to access systems from the
outside. Make sure their point of entry doesn't give them access to
systems they shouldn't have access to in the first place.
</p><p>
Today's little tutorial isn't really hacking. We're not doing anything
the protocols aren't designed to do. Heck, all the tools are available
pre-packaged in your distribution! I don't want anyone to spend too
much effort trying to block my &ldquo;attack&rdquo;, because it's not an attack
at all. It's just using the tools available in exactly the way they're
supposed to be used.
</p><p>
SSH is my favorite command-line utility. It can do so many things,
from transferring files to tunneling X11 traffic. As I described here,
you also can reroute traffic over tunnels giving you access to systems
that shouldn't easily be accessible. Ultimately, I hope learning about
SSH will get you interested in network security, because until you
understand the danger, there's not much motivation to learning and
implementing such systems. Until next time, happy tunneling!
