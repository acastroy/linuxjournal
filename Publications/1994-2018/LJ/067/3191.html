    Here's the way to develop a dial-on-demand database cluster
    in Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2185580.0x227d500"></a></h2></div></div><p>About half a year ago, we began a project
called NORA to develop an information system for a private dental
clinic in Hong Kong. The basic requirement was that the clinical
information, including patient folders, appointment books,
laboratory work, etc., could be retrieved and edited by any client
PC in the clinic. In addition, the users hoped they could access
the data from another clinic using the same system. The system is
now in beta testing. We gained some valuable experience during this
project, which may be useful for someone wishing to develop a
similar system, especially for small- to medium-sized businesses.
</p><p>We established the following requirements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a client-server database system</p></li><li><p>multi-site (de-centralized)</p></li><li><p>connectivity between LANs on demand</p></li><li><p>dial-up service</p></li><li><p>Windows 95 client</p></li><li><p>Big5 Character set support</p></li><li><p>low transaction rate</p></li><li><p>portability</p></li></ul></div><p>Since the system would be needed by several users (a dentist
and nurses) at the same time, a client-server system is expected.
The users do not know much about computers, but they do know
Microsoft. They insist on using Windows 95 as the operating system
of the client PC, so that they can use their favorite office suite
with the same machine. For the server part, they have no
preference, so we could decide. We considered both Windows NT and
Linux. After considering the stability, ease of installation, cost,
flexibility and the requirements listed above, we chose Linux. We
think we made the right choice; otherwise, the other system
requirements could not be easily fulfilled.
</p><p>The system is used by a group of several clinics. Users
wished to retrieve and update all data easily from any clinic. We
considered implementing the system on a single big server, with all
clinics connected to it by telephone line or ISDN. However, we
found that not only are the communication costs and efficiency
worse than the decentralized system (i.e., each clinic has its own
server), but also much work would be necessary if another clinic
joined the centralized system, since the data in both databases
would need to be merged.</p><p>As we chose to have one server in each clinic, the
connections between clinics should be made on demand, i.e., the
connection should be established only when needed. We could install
a modem for each client, so that one could dial the server of
another clinic to access the data independently. However, this is
not an effective method, since every client machine would need a
modem and telephone line, and most of the time they are idle. We
proposed that the connection be established by the servers, and the
clients access the data at another clinic through the servers on
demand.</p><p>We tried to use <span   class="bold"><b>diald</b></span> (dial
daemon) on Linux to provide this function. However, most of the
documentation on diald assumes the user is using it on a
stand-alone workstation or to dial an ISP to access the Internet.
The consequence is that the connection is not two-way, i.e., the
machine on the Internet cannot access the local workstations.
Moreover, the configuration in the document did not consider having
dial-in service on the same machine, and the two kinds of service
may or may not be compatible.</p><p>We found a way to configure diald and dial-in service on
Linux harmoniously. Thus, all machines in one clinic can access the
database server in another clinic based on dial-on-demand, while
the machines in the other clinic can access the database in the
first clinic at the same time.</p><p>Dial-in service is needed for the dial-in request from the
server in another clinic to connect the two LANs. Moreover, the
users want to access the data, even when they are at home, by a
stand-alone Windows 95 workstation with a modem.</p><p>As mentioned above, the users insist on using Windows 95 as
their front end. Finding proper method for connecting the client
software in Windows 95 to display the data in the Linux server was
a problem. This is because some of the database servers for Linux
do not provide this feature.</p><p>Another constraint for the server is that it must support
Big5 characters, since most of the patients use their Chinese name
and address for registration. This almost forces us to the final
choice of database server, the MySQL server.</p><p>We estimated the transaction rate of the system server and
found it should be relatively low, about ten SQL executions per
minute in the peak period. We think this property is common for
small- to medium-sized business applications, so the loading
performance of the database server is not crucial.</p><p>Finally, we always kept portability in mind. Even though the
client software is implemented on Windows 95, we hope to port it to
another platform in the future.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2185580.0x227e000"></a>Database Server Consideration</h2></div></div><p>When this article was being written, Informix-SE for Linux
was just becoming available, and Oracle had started to port their
database server to Linux. We did not consider these two popular
databases. We considered only database servers with these basic
properties:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It follows the relational model and supports SQL
(or a subset of SQL). The relational model has become a standard
for modern database servers. Our client software can communicate
with the database in the standard way using SQL. Therefore, even if
we change the database server software in the future, most of our
client code will not need to be changed.</p></li><li><p>It is free or low cost. We believe one can find
good software for free or low cost in the Linux world so we
considered the free database servers first. If none had satisfied
our requirements, we could then have considered a commercial
one.</p></li><li><p>It is open source, if possible. We wanted the
source code of our whole system including operating system,
client-server software and database server, so that our system
would not be affected by any standard or format changes by third
parties. Of course, we cannot have the code to Windows 95, which is
why we want to port the client software to another platform.</p></li></ul></div><p>The database servers were compared in four aspects: available
C API, available ODBC driver, Big5 code support and concurrency
control method. C API is important for the client software running
on Linux. The ODBC driver is for client software running on Windows
95. Big5 code support, as mentioned above, is one of the basic
requirements of our system. Since it is a multi-client system, the
method for preventing concurrent client data access from
interfering with each other is also important. We carried out a
survey of four popular database systems: PostgreSQL, Beagle SQL,
mSQL and MySQL. All source code to these systems is available. Both
PostgreSQL and Beagle SQL are free of charge. mSQL is free if you
use it in academic and registered charity organizations, otherwise
it costs $250 US for a single license. MySQL is free if you don't
sell it; otherwise, it costs $200 US per copy. The results are
shown in Table1.
</p><p><a href="3191t1.html" target="_self">Table 1.</a></p><p>MySQL was chosen as our database server. The most important
reasons were that it has an ODBC driver for Windows 95, and it
supports Big5 characters. MySQL is a multi-threaded process, with
one thread for each connection. Moreover, many support utilities
such as table repairing tools are provided. We recompiled it for
Big5 support. During beta testing, we found the system to be
stable, efficient and reliable on Red Hat 4.2. However, we found it
could not successfully compile and run on Red Hat 5.0, even when we
strictly followed the manual. We think the main reason is library
incompatibility.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2185580.0x227e4d0"></a>Client-Side Consideration</h2></div></div><p>We considered different C++ (or C) compilers for Windows 95,
and finally chose Borland (Inprise) C++Builder as our client-side
software development environment. Some visual objects are in
C++Builder (similar to Delphi and Visual Basic) to access the
content of a table in the database directly. They are supposed to
be simple and easy to use. However, when the program becomes large,
maintenance of the code with these kinds of objects is not easy,
because the behavior of each database widget is almost independent.
We decided to develop a layer of database objects to act as a
bridge between the visual objects and the database content. The SQL
statements are embedded in the database objects. In this way, the
clinical objects can be defined as database objects naturally and
consistently. Moreover, security checks can be implemented in this
layer of objects to protect the data being displayed on the visual
objects. We expect the portability of the software will be improved
as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2185580.0x227e5d8"></a>System Architecture</h2></div></div><p><a href="3191f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1.</a></p><p>The proposed system architecture of NORA is shown in Figure
1. In order to simplify the discussion, we assume the connection is
between two servers. The configuration can be generalized to
connections among several servers. For each clinic, there is a
Linux server for the database and diald. The Windows 95 clients are
connected to the local or remote database server through ODBC
drivers. <span   class="bold"><b>diald</b></span> starts the
connection to another server, if needed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2185580.0x227e7e8"></a>Configuring a Dial-Up Server</h2></div></div><p>Now we come to connection and configuration. Basically, we
will follow the FAQs and man pages on these topics. Since an agent
is needed to receive the dial-up call from another computer, we
installed <span   class="bold"><b>mgetty</b></span> to answer the
call from the modem. If the call is normal data communication,
<span   class="bold"><b>login</b></span> will be executed to prompt
the user on the other side. One of the nice features of mgetty is
that it can also act as a fax receiver if the call is a fax,
forwarding it to e-mail or printing it.
<span   class="bold"><b>mgetty</b></span> should be started by
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> and specified in
inittab.</p><p>The user on the other side can start
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> after logging in to the Linux
server. The options file of pppd should be kept in the simplest
form, i.e., IP address, netmask, etc., should not be specified.
This is necessary because this configuration is used by any
execution instance of pppd, even one started by diald. For example,
if an IP address is specified in the options file, the dial-out
connection (by diald) IP address will be fixed to the same address.
It is incorrect, since this address should be assigned by the
target server when the server dials out. A suggested PPP option
file, called options, is shown here:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
proxyarp
lock
crtscts
modem
</pre><p><a href="3191l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a>
</p><p>We leave the other configuration options to the connection
script. An example of a script for the dial-in PPP startup, called
<span   class="bold"><b>startppp</b></span>, is shown in Listing 1.
It should be noted that <b  >defaultroute</b> may not be
necessary for dial-up from a stand-alone PC, but it is necessary
for a LAN connection. Otherwise, there is no way for the dial-up
connection to route to all machines in the LAN. Moreover, we skip
the connect script for pppd since it can be found in the FAQs and
man pages.</p><p>You may check the completion of this phase by dialing in to
the server with a Windows 95 or another Linux PC using PPP. Start
PPP by executing startppp after login. The appearance should be
similar to dialing in to an ISP.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2185580.0x2676fb8"></a>Configuring a Dial-On-Demand Server</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned above, we are supposed to configure the
dial-on-demand servers in a symmetric manner, i.e., the connection
can be started by any server, and once the connection is
established, any machine on either side can access the server on
the other side, no matter where the connection started. In this
case, <b  >IPtranslation</b>, which is always mentioned
in the diald documentation for connection to the Internet, is not
needed. This will simplify the configuration of diald.</p><p>We install diald on the server and make it automatically
start up after the system boot-up. A sample of the configuration
file, diald.conf, is shown in Listing 2.</p><p><a href="3191l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a></p><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>addroute</b></span> script is
executed when diald starts. All the accesses to the remote site are
routed to the IP address that activates diald (aaa.bbb.fff.eee in
diald.conf). For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
/sbin/route add -net aaa.bbb.fff.0 \ # remote LAN
                                              # IP address
netmask 255.255.255.0 gw $4 \
window 2048 metric $5 dev $1
</pre><p>We skip the connect script for diald, since it should be
similar to the connect script for pppd. It should be noted that the
default gateway of all clients in a local LAN should be changed to
the IP address of the local server. You may check the completion of
this phase by accessing (e.g., using ping, FTP or TELNET) the
remote server from any PC in the local LAN. The modem will dial
out, and the server will successfully log in to the remote server.
However, you will receive no response from the remote server if it
has already configured diald in the same way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2185580.0x2677380"></a>System Integration</h2></div></div><p>The reason for the blocked connection between two servers
with diald can be explained in the following way. Since both
servers are ready to connect to the other side, the route tables of
both servers have a route to the IP address for activating diald if
the destination of any packet is to the other side. Therefore, for
example, serverA starts the connection to serverB and sends packets
to serverB after the connection is established. However, the return
packets cannot come back to serverA, since the default route in
serverB to serverA is to start diald in serverB. ServerA cannot
receive the return packets from serverB through the established
connection.</p><p>We solve this problem by using the
<span   class="bold"><b>ip-up.local</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ip-down</b></span> scripts of pppd.
<span   class="bold"><b>ip-up.local</b></span> is executed whenever
pppd establishes a connection successfully. So, we delete the route
table entry to serverA in serverB when pppd starts a connection.
Here is a sample of ip-up.local.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/sbin/route del aaa.bbb.fff.0 # remove remote IP
                                  # route
</pre><p>It should be noted that the script has no negative effect on
the dial-up service from a stand-alone PC. When the connection is
finished, the route table should be recovered. So the ip-down
script file, which is executed when pppd stops the connection, is
used like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
/usr/lib/diald/addroute sl0 \
255.255.255.0 \
aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd \       # server IP address
aaa.bbb.fff.eee \       # IP address will be activated
                        # by diald
1
</pre>


Basically, it is the same as the addroute script with the same
parameters as when diald starts. After this phase, you should be
able to access the remote server from any machine in the local LAN.
The remote server can access the local server at the same time.
Moreover, a stand-alone PC can dial up and access the server from
anywhere.
