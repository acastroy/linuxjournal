users and the media, as well as the traditional base of &ldquo;hackers&rdquo;
and hobbyists, it is no surprise that a plethora of introductory
books have appeared on your local bookstore's shelves. Some are
excellent, some are poor, and some fall in between.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Linux</em></span> by Arman Danesh could be one
of the good books, but due to some oversights, it doesn't quite
make it.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Linux</em></span> is a big book&mdash;928
pages; unfortunately, both its size and its title promise more than
it delivers. It is, for the most part, well-organized and
well-written, and contains much information; yet it falls short in
its promise of mastery of the subject.</p><p>According to the introduction, the book &ldquo;aims to open the
world of Linux to the average computer user.&rdquo; It recommends that
the reader be &ldquo;comfortable using a Windows or Macintosh system&rdquo;
and be conversant with using the DOS prompt. The level of writing
and the assumptions of prior computer knowledge in the book match
these initial guidelines. The writing style is clear and easy to
follow.</p><p>The book is organized into three major sections, with a large
appendix.</p><p>The first section, &ldquo;Welcome to Linux&rdquo;, covers a bit of the
history of Linux, an overview of the major distributions available,
and the minimum hardware requirements needed for a usable system.
Unfortunately, the author does not mention the large contribution
made by the GNU project. I'm not suggesting we slavishly insist on
calling Linux systems &ldquo;GNU/Linux&rdquo; or &ldquo;Linux/GNU&rdquo;, but fair is
fair. No wonder Richard Stallman gets upset these days.</p><p>Section two, &ldquo;Essential Linux&rdquo;, guides the user though a
typical installation from the supplied CD which contains a complete
Red Hat 5.1 distribution. Next, the author covers the task of
installing and configuring the X Window System and various window
managers, printers, modems and some commands and applications. I
believe the user described in the introduction should be able to
get a working Linux system set up using these instructions.</p><p>Section three, &ldquo;Linux in the Small Office/Home Office&rdquo;,
covers network configuration, Windows and Novell integration,
setting up routers, web servers and sendmail. Most users needing to
set up these types of services should have no problem using the
author's instructions.</p><p>Finally, there is the appendix. At just under 300 pages, this
is a major part of the book, but I'm not sure how useful much of it
is. For example, Appendix B (18 pages) is a listing of all the
fonts available under X (this seems to be a printout of
&ldquo;xlsfonts&rdquo;). Appendix D (26 pages) is a listing of a sendmail.cf
file. Also included in the appendices are &ldquo;The Linux Hardware
Compatibility HOWTO&rdquo; and &ldquo;The GNU Public License&rdquo;. On a positive
note, there is an excellent command reference which gives a short
overview of nearly 200 of the more common commands supplied in a
Linux distribution. In my opinion, this overview should have been
combined into the main text instead of being hidden in an
appendix.</p><p>My biggest problem with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Linux</em></span>
is it appears to be incomplete in many subjects. Being a tad
simplistic may be a virtue in a book destined for &ldquo;dummies&rdquo;;
however, something that promises you will &ldquo;learn everything Linux
has to offer your business or home office&rdquo; has to rise well beyond
the simple. In many places, the book either assumes too much of the
reader, or it stops short of truly completing the task at
hand.</p><p>Often, the book could leave the novice confused. For example,
when introducing Linux commands and file names, no mention is made
of the fact that Linux is case sensitive. To add confusion, the
sections on the various commands are introduced with the command
names in mixed-case, while the examples use the proper lowercase
names. Even though some mixed case file names are used in the
examples, presumably to illustrate that both upper and lower case
letters are acceptable in a file name, no mention of the need to
reproduce the case exactly is noted. Certainly, an experienced UNIX
user will know this, but pity the poor tyro graduating from the DOS
prompt.</p><p>At other places in the book, the instruction stops short of
the &ldquo;mastery level&rdquo; promised. The section on setting up a PPP
connection starts off using commands as root. This is fine for
getting a PPP connection established for the first time. But, the
author should have detailed methods for setting up the connection
scripts so that users other than root can use them. On a properly
configured system, there is no need to establish PPP connections
only as the root user.</p><p>Another example of not going far enough is the section on
configuring Sendmail. The author covers setting up sendmail just as
an on-line server, since it is &ldquo;a bit easier to configure and
understand than off-line servers.&rdquo; Yes, it is easier, but if I'm
mastering Linux, I really would like to do learn some of the hard
stuff as well.</p><p>The book does a good job in giving many overviews of the
different major user packages available. As two examples, Chapter 6
has nice overviews of nine different window managers and Chapter 27
overviews ten different web servers. Similar comparisons are made
throughout the book.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Mastering Linux</em></span> is not a bad book. If
anything, it is overly ambitious. It will enable a computer user
with some basic computer skills to get up and running with a Linux
installation on a PC, but I'm afraid some of its major oversights
will also leave him frustrated or rushing to buy other books. It is
useful, but don't be misled into thinking that this is the only
book you'll ever need or that you'll master Linux with it.</p></div></div>
