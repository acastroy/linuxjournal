items:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Woven Goods for Linux had the highest increase of
&ldquo;Links In&rdquo; among the resource sites: 226%. Freecode was second,

25%, respectively.</p></li></ul></div><p>As for the rest, you can draw your own conclusions. Bear in
mind the following disclaimers. These numbers were gathered on
August 21, 1999. Links In are current and updated constantly by
Alexa's 'bot. Visits are totaled over the preceding 6-month period.
Since Alexa's client software lives only on Windows and Mac
machines, visits do not (yet) include Linux or UNIX clients (see
the <i  >LJ</i> Index for some working irony on that
subject). &ldquo;SSC sites&rdquo; include the <i  >Linux Journal</i>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span>, Linux
Resources and ssc.com sites. <i  >Linux Journal</i> and
Linux Resources were combined during the survey period. Linux.com
also started in late May and was not in existence through much of
the survey period. The Slackware numbers below include all of
http://www.cdrom.com/ (of which Slackware puts up the biggest
numbers). Caldera also split into two sites (and two companies)
during this period.

Clark writes. &ldquo;We share Phil's opinion about Bill Gates, but we're
not anti-Red Hat. We just want to see them spreading some of their
newfound wealth&mdash;which is not equal to their market

Gates Wealth Clock put the man's worth at $97.6121 billion US. That
sum, however, was recently reduced by a chunk of change given to
the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, making it, at $17.1 billion
US, the largest charitable foundation in the United States.</p><p>So just how much did Mr. Bill give? Try $6 billion US. Or, by

platform to the Domino stable of platforms, he got a standing
ovation from 10,000 business partners and customers in this Disney

that now is the first time we've made code publicly

difference for you, now that you're overlapping with the
open-source world?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Don Harbison</b></span>: In the
open-source world, the technical community has the ability to
influence the direction of the OS. So the tool kit is not hostaged

of innovation. It's exciting!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fa580.0x287c190"></a>SIG OF THE MONTH</h2></div></div><p>On Bill Gates' tombstone: &ldquo;This man has performed an illegal

start-ups in the Bay Area alone. That's nearly double the money
spent in the same period one year earlier. Most of the recipients
were in the &ldquo;Internet space&rdquo;, and at least two were
Linux-related. One was VA Linux Systems, which received $25 million
US. The other was Google, which received another $25 million US.

harbinger of investments to come, look for Linux to be a prime
attractor of VC money very soon. Right now, the only thing holding
the VCs back is the same question that kept them from investing in
those Internet companies a few years back: &ldquo;If it's free and

submissions. There are pages and pages of results, which you can
read at http://www.borland.com/linux/. But none make side-by-side
comparisons of responses from programmers currently using Linux or
Windows as their primary development platform. The results are
pretty close (hey, they both want to work on Linux). One take-away
is a shared appetite for Rapid Application Development (RAD),
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Borland's own
Delphi, and&mdash;especially important to the Linux natives&mdash;IDEs that

wondered how soon the &ldquo;Linux: For IQs above 2000&rdquo; T-shirts would
show up. While I still think this has a nice ring to it, Linux has
become easier and easier, while the user base has gotten larger and
larger. One could know literally nothing about Linux, buy a machine
from VA, Penguin, ASl, Linux Laptops, NexTrend, Pogo, Telenet, DCG,
HiTech or whomever, and have it up and running in a matter of
minutes. However, if someone accidentally clicked the little
&ldquo;terminal&rdquo; icon (or, by some slip of the fingers, hit
<b  >ctrl-alt-f1</b>), how would he know what to
do?</p><p>Cyber Station's EX Linux has the answer. This company is
producing reference cards, mousepads and even software exclusively
for educating Linux users. The mousepad, for example, houses dozens
of key Linux commands for so many important things that practically
everything is covered. EZ Linux's software is an electronic
reference card, quite expanded from the mousepad, and full of all
kinds of things that will help you do anything you want on
Linux.</p><p>If you're past the point of needing a reference card to help
you mount and repair file systems, configure X and set up your
network, but you can't yet coordinate yourself well enough to buy a
Linux CD or do an ftp install, fezbox.com has the answer.</p><p>fezbox.com is an automated Red Hat installer on the Web. It's
just like installing from a CD-ROM, only the interface sits on the
Net and you get your files from an NFS server. It's still beta, and
you have to specify an NFS server, but there's probably a future in
web-based software installation. Maybe other distributions would
like to be represented on-line in this way.</p><p>Linux has been getting easier ever since its inception, and
now that the user base has expanded, it seems there is a demand to
make things even less difficult. Not so long ago, we saw the birth
of RPM, KDE, GNOME, easy auto-probing installers and numerous XF86
configuration utilities. Today, even kernel recompilation has an
easy-to-use graphical interface. Really, what's next?</p><p>&mdash;Jason Kroll</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fa580.0x287d688"></a>GAMES FOCUS--&gt;CODE WARS</h2></div></div><p>Artificial intelligence is one of my favorite topics in
computers&mdash;at the very least, it's a science-fiction fantasy which
inspires the imagination more than kernel development. A
particularly exciting subset of AI is robotics, which, when coupled
with some creative mishaps, leads to futuristic happenings as seen
in countless stories, films, computer games and toys. Computer
people often know the movies (maybe line for line), and probably
remember the computer games (such as Andrew Braybrook's immortal
Paradroid). Maybe we even had toy robots as children, though
disappointingly, they didn't go crazy and take over the
house/neighborhood/school/planet nearly as often as we might have
liked.</p><p>Hacking, &lt;\#224&gt; la Hollywood, is another topic we've
seen treated in books, movies and computer games. The mystique of
dark hackers, clad in black, hiding in basements while performing
nefarious deeds and drinking Jolt (although I have it on good
authority that real hackers drink fruit juice) probably draws many
people in (but what to do once we've dressed ourselves in black and
gone to the basement with soda pop is quite another matter). If we
can't start a global thermonuclear war (just
<span   class="emphasis"><em>try</em></span> playing &ldquo;wargames&rdquo;), at least we can
write a virus. Failing that, we'll have to play computer
games.</p><p>Fortunately for the Linux-using, aspiring ne'er-do-well,
there are a number of games available which allow us to do dark and
mysterious things like program robots to blow each other up and
code viruses to battle for RAM domination.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fa580.0x287d898"></a>Core Wars</h2></div></div><p><a href="3696lf10.jpg" target="_self">Core Wars Screenshot</a></p><p>Virus enthusiasts might enjoy this game, first developed by
the well-known computer scientist and author A.K. Dewdney in the
early 1980s as discussed in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scientific
American</em></span>. In Core War (or Core Wars, as you like), two
or more assembly code programs battle against each other in memory
with the purpose of killing off all the enemies' processes by
forcing them to execute a certain command. The assembly code is
called Redcode, which is rather simple yet wholly adequate, and the
virtual computer which runs the cores is called MARS (Memory Array
Redcode Simulator). Memory arrays can range from tiny to enormous,
and several cores can battle at a given time.</p><p>Like many pursuits, learning to play is simple, while
strategies quickly become clever and complex. I spent a great part
of my thirteenth year of life on this game, carrying a calculator
with me to work out algorithms, so be warned&mdash;it can become an
obsession. Also, it's good for young people, an easy way to teach
assembly code to kids (well, you can't let them grow up without
knowing asm, can you?).</p><p>The standards of Redcode have changed significantly since the
1980s (the initial version ultimately became rather exhausted) and
now allow for much more complex programs, although the basic
strategies remain the same. There are on-line tournaments running
all the time, so you can try your cores against the world's best. A
while ago, a friend found some of our old cores on a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>disk</em></span> (which should tell you how old they are)
and I tried them against the net-warriors&mdash;our cores got
terminated, so it appears the standards have improved.
Assembly-code devotees should do very well at this game.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fa580.0x2880160"></a>RealTimeBattle</h2></div></div><p><a href="3696lf11.jpg" target="_self">RealTimeBattle
Screenshot</a></p><p>If robots inspire your fancy more than viruses,
RealTimeBattle by Erik Ouchterlony and Ragnar Ouchterlony may be
more to your liking. Essentially, you program a robot to battle
other robots in real time. One thing that distinguishes it from
many programming games is that you can use any language you like to
program your robots, since they communicate to the server through
STDIN and STDOUT. The use of real languages allows for more
legitimate intelligence in the machinery.</p><p>Robots are physically identical and have energy, scanners,
cannons and movement devices. The world in which they operate has
gravity, friction, air resistance, bouncing, skidding and the like.
Combat arenas can be large and open or filled with walls, and can
accommodate up to 120 simultaneous robots.</p><p>Though already entirely playable, this software is in a state
of continual development. Already I can see many possibilities for
this one, such as an on-line server, massive multi-level maze-like
arenas and so on. Anyone who remembers games like Crobots on the
Amiga or RobotBattle on the unmentionable OS will probably find
this game quite an improvement.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fa580.0x28803c8"></a>Automata Zero</h2></div></div><p>There comes a time in everyone's life when a squadron of
robots isn't enough. You want an army of robots, designed and
programmed by you. Fine, with Automata Zero, you can have
them&mdash;literally an army. And, you not only design and program the
robots, you can program them to respond to real-time commands from
your terminal, and you can change code on the fly. Automata Zero's
graphics are much more advanced than those of Core Wars or
RealTimeBattle and feature aesthetic landscapes with grass, water,
trees and futuristic mechanical structures. The robots themselves
look like Mechs. The development team says graphics are a low
priority, but that's hard to believe when they look so nice. Zed is
the name of the programming language, which doesn't feature dynamic
memory allocation, floating-point operations, threads or pointers,
but does have arrays, functions and scoped variables; it is a
fairly simple mixture of C, BASIC and Matlab. Automata Zero is
still under development and needs more developers. You can visit
Automata Zero's home page at http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~sand/ to
learn how to contribute or just play the game. It's a little closer
to your typical strategic conquest-of-the-world game than the
others. Presumably, if you lose, the world will be overrun with
enemy robots who will come to your basement and blow you up, along
with whatever soda pop you may be harboring. Good luck! (May the
bitstream be with you?)</p><p>&mdash;Jason Kroll</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3696sf12.large.jpg"><img src="3696sf12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Stop the Presses: So why is Red Hat worth more than Laos?
</p></div></div><p>Six months ago, Red Hat was a &ldquo;free&rdquo; software company that
lost money on less than $11 million in sales in its last fiscal
year. By late summer, it was worth upwards of $7 billion US.
(Perspective: the gross domestic product of Laos is less than $6
billion US, according to the World Factbook.)</p><p>Don't waste your time wondering if Red Hat's valuation is
&ldquo;real&rdquo; or deserved. We're talking about a real market here: the
market for shares of a company. If that market says the smallest
piece of Red Hat is worth exactly $100, well, it is. Multiply that
by all 66,835,105 equal-sized pieces of Red Hat, and you've got a
company that's worth exactly $6,683,510,400 US. That's the obvious
part.</p><p>What's not so obvious is that only 6,000,000 of those shares
were put on the market in Red Hat's IPO (initial public offering)
in August. That's less than 10% of all the stock issues by the
company. The rest were not released to the market. When there's a
lot of demand and highly constrained supply, the price goes up. And
with that price goes the value of <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the
company's shares. Neat, huh?</p><p>Now think about all the other Linux-related IPOs that should
be coming up. We learned about Cobalt Networks and Andover.net in
September, when there were also rumors about Caldera and VA Linux
Systems. If these companies do even half as well as Red Hat, think
of what that will do for the value of every Linux business.</p><p>Welcome to the New World!</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fa580.0x2880948"></a>STRICTLY ON-LINE</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>NoSQL Tutorial</b></span> by Giuseppe
