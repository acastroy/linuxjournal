    A comprehensive look at the NoSQL database.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab9580.0x2bb14a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Some months ago I had a discussion with
NoSQL creator, Carlo Strozzi, regarding the databases.
</p><p>I should admit, I am an SQL fan! It's hot having the same
language, no matter which platform or database engine is used. He
underlined the fact that most SQL engines lack of flexibility and
waste system resources (memory and disk space) because of their
multi-platform environment (such as Oracle, DB2, Informix,
etc.).</p><p>He suggested I have a look at the white paper that inspired
him: &ldquo;The UNIX Shell As a Fourth Generation Language&rdquo; by Evan
Schaffer (evan@rsw.com) and Mike Wolf (wolf@hyperion.com).</p><p>Quoting from the above paper:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>... almost all [database systems] are software
prisons that you must get into and leave the power of UNIX behind.
[...] The resulting database systems are large, complex programs
which degrade total system performance, especially when they are
run in a multi-user environment. [...] UNIX provides hundreds of
programs that can be piped together to easily perform almost any
function imaginable. Nothing comes close to providing the functions
that come standard with UNIX.</p></blockquote></div><p>The UNIX file structure is the fastest and most
readily-available database engine ever built: directories may be
viewed as catalogs and tables as plain ASCII files. Commands are
common UNIX utilities, such as
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>sed</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span>. Nothing should be reinvented.
</p><p>NoSQL was born with these ideas in mind: getting the most
from the UNIX system, using some commands that glue together
various standard tools. Although NoSQL is a good database system,
this is not a panacea for all you problems. If you have to deal
with a 10 gigabytes table that must be updated each second from
various clients, NoSQL doesn't work for you since it lacks of
performance on very big tables, and on frequent updates you must be
in real time. For this case, I suggest you use a stronger solution
based on Oracle, DB2 or such packages on a Linux cluster, AS/400 or
mainframes.</p><p>However, if you have a web site containing much information
and more reading occurs than writing, you will be surprised how
fast is it. NoSQL (pronounced noseequel, as the author suggests)
derives most of its code from the RDB database developed at RAND
Organization, but more commands have been built in order to
accomplish more tasks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab9580.0x2bb1978"></a>Installing NoSQL</h2></div></div><p>The latest NoSQL source code can be found at
ftp://ftp.linux.it/pub/database/NoSQL, but RPM and Debian packages
are also available. At the time of writing, latest stable version
is 2.1.3.</p><p>Just unpack the source using the command
<b  >tar&nbsp;-xzvvf&nbsp;nosql-2.1.3.tar.gz</b> in a
convenient directory (such as $HOME/src), and you will get all the
code in the nosql-2.1.3 subdirectory. Enter the above subdirectory
and do the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./configure
make
make install
</pre><p>The software will put its engine into /usr/local/lib/nosql,
its documentation in /usr/local/doc/nosql and a symlink
/usr/local/bin/nosql that points to the real executable
(/usr/local/lib/nosql/sh/nosql). You can change the directory
prefix (e.g., /usr instead of /usr/local) invoking
<b  >./configure&nbsp;--prefix=/usr</b>.
</p><p>You should copy the sample configuration file to the $NSQLIB
directory (i.e., /usr/local/lib/nosql). This is not required but
it's useful for changing some parameters via configuration file
instead of variables. The commands</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp nosql.conf.sample /usr/local/lib/nosql/nosql.conf
chmod 0664 /usr/local/lib/nosql/nosql.conf
</pre><p>will copy it with the right permissions. You can optionally
have a personal NoSQL configuration file creating an
$HOME/.nosql.conf with 0664 permission applied.
</p><p>Although NoSQL installation is quite simple, I suggest you to
read the INSTALL file: the author gives some good tips.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab9580.0x2bb1d98"></a>Getting Some Steps Around</h2></div></div><p>Now that the package has been installed, let's start getting
acquainted with NoSQL commands through an example.</p><p>We are the usual Acme Tools Inc. which supplies stuffs to the
Toonies land. We would like to track our customers, so we should
create a first table in which we will list some customers details
(such as code, phone, fax, e-mail, etc...). The best way to create
tables from scratch is via template files.</p><p>A template file contains the column names of the table and
associated optional comments separated by tabs and/or spaces.
Comments may be also specified with the usual hash sign (#) as the
first character of the line. The file below, customer.tpl, is our
template for the customer table.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Acme Tools, Inc.
# Customers table
#######################
CODE    Code number
NAME    Name/Surname
PHONE   Phone no
EMAIL   E-mail
</pre><p>Most of the NoSQL commands read from STDIN and write to
STDOUT. The <span   class="bold"><b>maketable</b></span> command,
which builds tables from templates, is one of these. Issuing the
command
<pre     class="programlisting">
nosql maketable &lt; customer.tpl
</pre>


we'll get the table header on STDOUT:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CODE    NAME    PHONE   EMAIL
----    ----    -----   -----
</pre>


Great, but we should keep it in a file. We could simply redirect
the command output to a file, e.g.,
<pre     class="programlisting">
nosql maketable &lt; customer.tpl &gt; customer.rdb
</pre>


but this wouldn't be the right way. The
<span   class="bold"><b>write</b></span> command may be helpful in
this case, as it reads a table from STDIN (a simple header in this
case) and writes a file, checking data integrity.
</p><p>The resulting command would be</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nosql maketable &lt; customer.tpl |
  nosql write -s customer.rdb.
</pre><p>The <b  >-s</b> switch in the write operator
suppress STDOUT, e.g., <b  >nosql&nbsp;write</b>, similar
to the <span   class="bold"><b>tee</b></span> UNIX utility, writes
both to file and STDOUT, unless <b  >-s</b> is specified.
</p><p>Pay attention, because the write command does not do any
locking on the output table:
<b  >nosql&nbsp;lock&nbsp;table</b> and
<b  >nosql&nbsp;unlock&nbsp;table</b> must be used for
this purpose.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab9580.0x2bb2528"></a>First Editing: Using edit Command</h2></div></div><p>Now let's add our first customer with the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nosql edit customer.rdb
</pre><p>The default editor is the <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>
command, but you can use your favorite editor changing the EDITOR
environment variable. The screen below is presented to the user:
<pre     class="programlisting">

</pre>


Just fill the fields with some information, remembering to separate
values from field names with a tab. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Do not
delete</em></span> first and last blank lines, this is not a bug:
it's the way NoSQL handle lists. But I prefer to let you discover
this little feature later in this article.

Now that we have filled in the form, just write it
(<b  >ESC</b> then <b  >:wq!</b>) and the
command will check if the format is correct and write it to disk.
Wow, we have a real table and real data!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab9580.0x2bb28f0"></a>NoSQL Table Format</h2></div></div><p>Since we are curious, we will taking a look to the real file

</pre><p>First of all, is important to note the fact that all columns
are tab-separated: please keep this in mind when you want some
external program to update the table, otherwise you will break the
table integrity.
</p><p>The first line is called the <span   class="emphasis"><em>headline</em></span>
and contains column names; the second is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>dashline</em></span> and separates the headline from the
body: both are named the <span   class="emphasis"><em>table header</em></span>. The
rest is called the <span   class="emphasis"><em>table body</em></span> and contains the
actual data.</p><p>A number of commands have been build to displays these parts,
and they are simply calls to ordinary UNIX utilities:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >nosql body</b>: displays the table
body (same as: <b  >tail +3 &gt; table</b>)</p></li><li><p><b  >nosql dashline</b>: displays the
table dash line (same as: <b  >sed -n 2p &lt;
table</b>)</p></li><li><p><b  >nosql header</b>: displays the full
table header (same as: <b  >head -2 &lt;
table</b>)</p></li><li><p><b  >nosql headline</b>: displays the
table headline (same as: <b  >head -1 &lt;
table</b>)</p></li><li><p><b  >nosql see</b>: displays the
<b  >TAB</b> character as <b  >^I</b> and
<b  >newline</b> as <b  >$</b>, making much
easier to see what's wrong on a broken table (same as: <b  >cat
-vte &lt; table</b>)</p></li></ul></div><p>Once again, this shows how powerful the UNIX OS is on its
own, and how handy it can be for add-on packages such as NoSQL to
tap into this power without having to re-invent the wheel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab9580.0x2ba9e38"></a>Simple Data Insertion: Using Shell
Variables</h2></div></div><p>A fun way to fill the table is using the environment
variables. You can export variables in any way, e.g., using UNCGI
in a CGI environment or named as column names with the desirable
values as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export CODE="ACM002"
export NAME="Daffy Duck"
export PHONE="1-800-COOK-ME"
export EMAIL="dduck@looneys.com"
</pre><p>Then issue the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
nosql lock customer.rdb; env | nosql shelltotable |\
nosql column CODE NAME PHONE EMAIL |\
nosql merge CODE NAME PHONE EMAIL customer.rdb |\
nosql write -s customer.rdb; nosql unlock customer.rdb
</pre>


and the work is done&mdash;a bit cryptic? Yes, but that's the power of
NoSQL: all can be done in a single shell command. Let's explain it:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >nosql lock customer.rdb</b>: this
locks the table and ensures noone else can write in the table at
the same time we do.</p></li><li><p><b  >env</b>: prints the environment
variable.</p></li><li><p><b  >nosql shelltotable</b>: reads all
variables from the pipe and writes a single record table containing
all values to STDOUT.</p></li><li><p><b  >nosql column CODE NAME PHONE
EMAIL</b>: reads the NoSQL table containing the environment
variables from the pipe and selects column CODE, NAME, PHONE and
EMAIL in that order and writes STDOUT.</p></li><li><p><b  >nosql merge CODE NAME PHONE EMAIL
customer.rdb</b>: reads the two merging tables, one from pipe
(STDIN) and other from file, writing the merged table to stdout.
The resulting table has two records: the existing one and the new
one extracted from the above process.</p></li><li><p><b  >nosql write -s customer.rdb</b>:
reads the resulting table (merged from the above command) and
writes it to disk as customer.rdb. We already explained what switch
<b  >-s</b> means.</p></li><li><p><b  >nosql unlock customer.rdb</b>:
unlocks the table.</p></li></ul></div>

Now have a look to the resulting table using the command that reads
the table: <b  >nosql&nbsp;cat&nbsp;customer.rdb</b>.

</pre><p>Yes, you're right! This is the same way the edit command
displays data. Although list tables aren't performing at all, in my
opinion they are a good way to insert new data into tables. It's
handy creating a program that can output this fashion. An example
is shown in <a href="3294l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.
</p><p>Okay, this is not a &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; shell program, but
this example may show that the complete operation is easy with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>every</em></span> language, even the shell.</p><p>There are a couple of things I would like to emphasize about
the above code. How can a list be merged with a real table? The
command <span   class="bold"><b>listtotable</b></span> does the job
for you, as you probably guessed looking at the pipe, converting
the list format to the table one. A reverse command,
<span   class="bold"><b>tabletolist</b></span>, exists as
well.</p><p>Please notice the beginning and ending newlines, as well as
the tabs between field name and value, which appear in the print
statement: these are required in order to create the correct list
structure.</p><p>The list structure, as well as table structure, are well
documented in the Chapter 2 of the NoSQL reference you will find in
/usr/local/doc/nosql/doc.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab9580.0x2baad58"></a>Getting More from NoSQL</h2></div></div><p>Now, let's have a business example? A complete catalog was

is, of course, indices, and NoSQL obviously has its own operators
to interact with them.</p><p>Suppose our customers are increasing greatly since Acme Inc.
started, so we need to speed up our searches. Most of the time, we
look up on the CODE column, so it would be better to build the
index on it last.</p><p>The command <b  >nosql index customer.rdb CODE</b>
will create an index on customer.rdb table against the CODE column.
Index files are named by appending an x and the column name(s)
(separated by a dot) to the base name of the table it refers to. In
our case, the index file name is customer.x.CODE. If we want to
update the index without rebuilding it, we should run</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nosql index -update customer.x.CODE
</pre><p>A crontab job on our system will ensure a periodic index
update, by running the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /var/tables/acmeinc; nosql index -update
</pre>


Not specifying any index file name on <b  >nosql index
-update</b> will update all indices in the current working
directory.
</p><p>Now that indices are built, let's try a search. In order to
search against indices, you should create a small key table as
input to the <b  >nosql search</b> command, for
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo -e "CODE\n----\nACM004" | nosql search -ind customer.x.CODE
</pre><p>This command will extract the <b  >ACM004</b> value
in the CODE column using the customer.x.CODE index. Creating this
key table may not seem handy, but this ensures the maximum reuse of
commands. Suppose you extracted some data from table1, you can
search this last result on table2 easily with a single pipe. Try to
think a bit about it, this is not a bad idea at all.

configuration management tools available, it can be used for
version control of many types of files, including tables. The
command <b  >nosql edit</b>, for example, will
automatically check out a table for editing, and then check the new
version back into RCS. Other commands can utilize tables that are
under RCS control by using explicit commands like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
co  -p  table | nosql row  ... | nosql column  ... | nosql print
</pre><p>or relying upon the <span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span>
command to handle interactions with RCS automatically:
<pre     class="programlisting">
nosql cat table | nosql row  ... | nosql column  ... | nosql print
</pre>


Note that this checks out a table, sends it to <b  >nosql
row</b>, then to <b  >nosql column</b>, and
finally, prints the data with <b  >nosql print</b>. In
general, any series of commands necessary can be constructed to do
a given task even if the tables are checked into RCS.
</p><p>Now that you have RCS keeping watch for you, if the disaster
happens in real life, you can easily
<span   class="bold"><b>rollback</b></span>: the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
nosql rollback [-d <span   class="emphasis"><em>datestring</em></span>] <span   class="emphasis"><em>tablename</em></span>
</pre><p>will extract the table updated at the desired time.

permissions to files using groups: create a group for those users
who can access these files. This is a great security wall.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab9580.0x2ec0b30"></a>Performance Tips</h2></div></div><p>No matter what program you have to deal with, sooner or later
you will have to deal with performance. I'm not a developer of the
NoSQL Database System, but I can give you some useful
advice.</p><p>First of all, keep your tables small. Don't keep all the data
in a single table, this is a waste of performance. Using the method
that best suits your environment, try splitting tables into several
files and organizing them into directories. In our examples, we can
keep track of our customers creating a single &ldquo;phone directory&rdquo;
(i.e., customer.rdb), then creating a directory for each order
status (received, waiting_for_bill, archive), and last a table for
each customer (the file name will be the customer code). For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/var/tables/acmeinc/
customer.rdb
                    catalog.rdb
                    received/
                             ACM001.rdb
                             ACM003.rdb
                    w4bill/
ACM002.rdb
                             ACM003.rdb
                    archive/
                             ACM001.rdb
                             ACM002.rdb
                             ACM003.rdb
</pre><p>If you must do everything in a big table and you have to
update it frequently, there's a trick for you if it's an indexed
file: journaling.
</p><p>Create a journaling table, say customer.j, with exactly the
same header as customer.rdb, but containing only those records
which we want to insert into, remove from or append to
customer.rdb. The entries in customer.j must be in a format
suitable for the <b  >nosql merge</b> command.</p><p>Whenever we fetch data from customer.rdb we will have to do
it in three logical steps. The first step is to use
<span   class="bold"><b>search</b></span> on bigtable to take
advantage of the indices. This will produce an intermediate output
that will then be merged into customer.j, and the final output will
undergo the original query statement again.</p><p>Any updates to customer.rdb will be done to customer.j with
the syntax described in the documentation of the
<span   class="bold"><b>merge</b></span> command (there you'll find
how to use the operator to the optimum level). You will also have
to make sure that customer.j is kept sorted on its primary key
field after each update. For example, if you have an index on the
CODE column in the customer.rdb table, you should use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo -e "CODE\n----\nACM004" | nosql search -ind customer.x.CODE |\
nosql merge CODE NAME PHONE EMAIL customer.j | \
nosql row 'CODE=="ACM004"'
</pre><p>As you can see, the trick is:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Perform an indexed search on customer.rdb to
quickly obtain a much smaller (possibly empty) subset of the
table.</p></li><li><p>Merge the first output with customer.j on the fly
during the query.</p></li><li><p>Do a sequential post-query on the final
output.</p></li></ol></div>

If that's not enough, another trick to improve speed is to make
your AWK use the <span   class="bold"><b>ash</b></span> (by Kenneth
Almquis) for <span   class="bold"><b>system()</b></span>'s and pipes,
since this shell is small and fast at startup. Suppose your AWK is
/usr/bin/mawk and your shell is /bin/ash (a fairly common case,
especially on Debian GNU/Linux), then you can do something like
this:
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Create the following hard link: <b  >ln
/bin/ash /bin/ah</b></p></li><li><p>Modify AWK to make it use /bin/ah as opposed to
/bin/sh, and write the modified AWK to /usr/local/bin/nsq-mawk: sed
's/\/bin\/sh/\/bin\/ah/g' /usr/bin/mawk\&gt;
/usr/local/bin/nsq-mawkchmod 755 /usr/local/bin/nsq-mawk</p></li><li><p>Modify the NSQAWK value in the config file
(/usr/local/lib/nosql/nosql.conf or $HOME/.nosql.conf) to
/usr/local/bin/nsq-mawk. This will speed up your queries !</p></li></ol></div>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab9580.0x313d2b8"></a>Going to the Web</h2></div></div><p>Using NoSQL on the Web is a matter of seconds. Let's suppose
that Acme Tools Inc. now has a web site, and you want your customer
to search on database for their pending orders. We first create a
small input form, the file getname.html show in
<a href="3294l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>, on which we ask for
customer name. I did not use any security at all in this example,
but at least password should be asked in a production
environment.</p><p>Since we are not good at graphics, we create a small template
(result.html) that can be modified easily. This template,
result.html, is shown in <a href="3294l3.html" target="_self">Listing
3</a>.</p><p>In this template, some keywords are substituted by the CGI:
our standard keywords start and end with a double hash (#) sign,
for example ##KEYWORD##.</p><p>A special section of the template, named stanza, will be
repeated as many times as the number of query rows. The stanza
starts and ends with special comments that will be recognized by
the CGI.</p><p>Now is the time for writing the CGI:
<a href="3294l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>, result.pl, is a perl
script that should perform the queries based on the input name and
then creates a resulting page based on the previous template. Most
of the queries used in this CGI are those used in previous
examples, so we won't repeat them. Just have a look to the main
query:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
@cusdata = `nosql cat $datafile | nosql join -j PROD - $ctlgfile |
nosql addcol SUBTOTAL | nosql compute 'SUBTOTAL = QTY*PRICE' | nosql
column PROD DESC QTY PRICE SUBTOTAL | nosql body`;
</pre><p>The thing to notice is the array that will contain query
rows: each row contains a tab separated list of fields, as the
NoSQL table row specification. In fact, in the stanza keyword
substitution, a <span   class="bold"><b>split</b></span> function
against tab is used:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my ($prod, $desc, $qty, $price, $subtotal) = split(/\t/, $data);
</pre>


All queries run with back ticks that, instead of the
<span   class="bold"><b>exec()</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>system()</b></span>, return the STDOUT of the
program. This output may be reused in the program using variables.
A negative fact of this is security: you cannot run this program in
tainted mode (<b  >-T</b> switch in the perl command
line), but this can be avoided with some tricks such as the ones I
used. First of all, you should avoid buffer overruns by using a
substring function <b  >($cusname = substr($cusname, 0,
50))</b>, then keeping out some escape characters (such as
&gt; Once the queries have been executed and we have all the
necessary values, we load the template file and associate it with
the default input and pattern-searching space. The template file,
in which we transformed new lines and multiple spaces into a single
space, is now divided into three parts using pattern matching: the
header, the body (aka stanza) and the footer.
<pre     class="programlisting">
/(.+)&lt;\s*!--\s*here\s+starts\s+nosql\s+stanza\s*---&gt;(.+)&lt;\s*!--\s*here
\s+ends\s+nosql\s+stanza\s*--\s*&gt;(.+)/i ;
</pre>


This search will identify the stanza into the template, using the
keyword <b  >&lt;!-- here starts nosql stanza --&gt;</b>
as the beginning and <b  >&lt;--! here ends nosql stanza
--&gt;</b> as the end. As you can notice, these are simple
HTML comments, so can be introduced easily by our graphic experts.
All items before the beginning comment is considered the header,
while the rest is the footer.
</p><p>Before entering the keyword processing in the body, we will
do it in the header and footer in order to set proper customer name
and total amount due:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$header =~ s/##NAME##/$cusname/;
$footer =~ s/##TOTAL##/$total/;
</pre><p>The final part is the keyword substitution in the stanza.
Here we will swap the original variable
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>$body</em></span>) with a temporary one
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>$tmpbody</em></span>), in order to leave the first
unchanged for next loop. Here the fields are split using the method
I described earlier, then substituted for the keywords in the
template file. Of course, there are thousands of way of writing
down this kind of CGI, be it in Perl or other languages. Write one
in your favorite language and let your imagination be your guide:
databases are plain ASCII files, so you can process them as you
like, and you will get great results.

revealed to me some news on ongoing development of the
RDBMS.</p><p>The first minor modification you will see at a glance is the
version number: kernel release schema has been introduced, so even
numbers are the stable ones, while odd ones are unstable (current
unstable is 2.3.1).</p><p>The major modification is the
<span   class="bold"><b>rel</b></span> command. It checks table
reference integrity before an update/insert/delete, but won't take
any action: it only advises you if something will be broken , so
you should use it in your program before you do any table
operation.</p><p>Other minors enhancements are some commands such as
<span   class="bold"><b>insert</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>delete</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>tabletoperl</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>perlencode</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>tabletom4</b></span> that are quite useful in
a programming environment as well as on the command line. At
present, no official reference for those commands, but comments in
the source code will easily let you understand how to use
them.</p><p>Mr. Carlo Strozzi told me that the next stable release,
2.4.0, will be available around November of 1999.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2ab9580.0x313e078"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>NoSQL is a great database system for web-based applications,
