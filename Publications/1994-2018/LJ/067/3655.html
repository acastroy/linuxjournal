Expo in San Jose, California, I had the privilege of having lunch
with Linus Torvalds. While we had met briefly before, this was the
first time I had talked to him face-to-face rather than by e-mail.
He turned out to be a very personable young man&mdash;very self-assured
and articulate. At his keynote the night before, he had exuded this
same calm presence, answering questions with aplomb and the
confidence that comes from knowing his subject well. He surprised
me at lunch by admitting to being nervous about public speaking&mdash;it
certainly does not show&mdash;so I guess he is human after all! I
steered clear of the normal topics (Linux and Transmeta), hoping to
give you a picture of who exactly Linus is. Here's our
conversation.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Let's start at the
beginning. Where were you born? When?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Helsinki, Finland,
December 28, 1969.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Practically a
Christmas birthday!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Yeah, it isn't a good
time to be born if you like getting presents. You always get
combination presents, but it turned out okay for me. It's a good
day. In Finland, it is known as the day of &ldquo;the children without
fault&rdquo;&mdash;not exactly &ldquo;without fault&rdquo;, more &ldquo;almost
perfect&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Looks like it's
true. Did you grow up in Helsinki, or did you move around?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I lived in Helsinki
all my life, until two and a half years ago. I was as much of a
city kid as you can be in Helsinki. It is not a big city&mdash;it has
half a million people. I basically lived in the central parts of
Helsinki all my life. I wouldn't know nature if it jumped out and
bit me.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Oh, you never did
the outdoors thing&mdash;go to the mountains, or...?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: No, I never did the
outdoors thing. Moving out here to Silicon Valley was like moving
out into the suburbs&mdash;very different. I am used to living in a
five-story building. Here, having a small house with a back yard
feels definitely rural.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Well, people here
don't consider living in a house rural.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: No, I mean it's very
different the way people think about living. Cities in the U.S. are
much more sprawling because people want to live in their own
houses. European countries are older; most people live in&mdash;not
skyscrapers&mdash;but certainly buildings with five, six or seven
stories.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How about brothers
and sisters?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I have one sister who
is sixteen months younger than I am, and I have one half brother
who is nine years younger&mdash;he is twenty now. I actually have two
half brothers in addition to that who are younger than my older
daughter. My dad is very virile&mdash;more virile than is good for him!
What can I say?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Well, it happens.
Did you have a fairly happy childhood?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I'd say I had a
happy, fairly normal childhood. My parents got divorced when I was
small. I lived with my mother and also my grandparents. My mom was
a working mother, so I ended up being at my grandparents' house for
a large portion of the time&mdash;fairly normal years. Probably what
happens is you grow up to be fairly independent when you come from
a family like that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: That could be. Your
parents are both journalists, right?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: My whole family is
journalists. Everybody&mdash;my mom, my dad, my sister is getting into
the journalistic thing, my uncle, my grandfather on my father's
side&mdash;everybody.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Wow&mdash;what kind of
influence did that have on you?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: It doesn't make much
of a difference because they are all different kinds of
journalists. My mom was a translator; she wasn't the kind of
journalist who goes out and searches for stories. She worked for
the Finnish newspaper doing translations and news graphics. My dad
was more of an &ldquo;out there&rdquo; radio journalist, so he was really
excited when the Chechnyan war was going on. So he went there and
had to wear a bullet-proof vest&mdash;he is that kind of
person&mdash;remember, virile. My uncle works for Finnish TV.. My
grandfather used to be the Editor in Chief of a newspaper. Mainly,
the whole family had a kind of book-learning experience. It was
considered good to know English and important to read well. So it
was very natural to go to university and stuff like that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Did it make you more
political? Are you interested in politics?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I'm absolutely
uninterested in politics. Probably because&mdash;I don't know&mdash;it was a
fairly political family, so I may have reacted against that by
being non-political. I'm not very interested. I'm much more to the
left than the right in the U.S. kind of political sense. I'm fairly
liberal, but at the same time, I really don't want to go into
politics. My parents in the sixties were kind of radical
people&mdash;they have calmed down a lot! They are not political
anymore, but I grew up in a fairly political environment.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3655f2.jpg"></div>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: The sixties were
pretty much like that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I still meet people
who say, &ldquo;Oh, I knew your Dad! And I remember when you were
crawling around under the kitchen table at your home when they had
student meetings!&rdquo; or whatever.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How about
religion?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Hmmm, completely
a-religious&mdash;atheist. I find that people seem to think religion
brings morals and appreciation of nature. I actually think it
detracts from both. It gives people the excuse to say, &ldquo;Oh, nature
was just created&rdquo;, and so the act of creation is seen to be
something miraculous. I appreciate the fact that, &ldquo;Wow, it's
incredible that something like this could have happened in the
first place.&rdquo; I think we can have morals without getting religion
into it, and a lot of bad things have come from organized religion
in particular. I actually fear organized religion because it
usually leads to misuses of power.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: As in holy
wars?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Yeah, and I find it
kind of distasteful having religions that tell you what you can do
and what you can't do. Catholicism is an example of that kind of
non-permissiveness, and I think that is very easy to get into if
you are an organized religion. Religion is a very strange area. In
Finland, nobody cares. Many people are religious in Finland, but
it's not a political issue. Over here, religion has become
politicized, so you have the fringe people in the news. And then
people are afraid to talk about it because it has political
implications, and that's usually not true in most of Europe.
Religion is a personal matter, but does not matter for anything
else. That's how I think it should be done.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Yes, we were founded
to keep the two separated. Then the Moral Majority found out what a
large constituency they had, and...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Yeah, it's kind of
ironic that in many European countries, there is actually a kind of
legal binding between the state and the state religion. At the same
time, in practice, religion has absolutely nothing to do with
everyday life. Maybe the taxes to the church, but that's it. They
don't have any political power.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Here it's called
tithing, not taxes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Actually, in Finland
they call it taxes&mdash;you pay taxes to the church. If you are a
member of the church, you pay 2% tax to the church. And that's the
amount of legal binding between the church and the state. Apart
from that, they are completely separate. In the U.S., church and
state claim to be very separate, but you still see the church has a
lot of power in politics.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: So, were you shy as
a child? Or an extrovert?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I was an absolute
geek&mdash;no social graces whatsoever.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: None, eh?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: None!</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3655f3.jpg"></div>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Not popular with the
girls?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: No, I can't claim I
was. I was a complete nerd. I was not unpopular; I wasn't alone or
unfriendly or anything like that. But I was certainly not one of
the people known by everyone.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: So you liked going
to school?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Yeah, I liked it. I
also liked the social parts. Especially at university, my studies
were probably less important than being part of the student
organization and going to parties and stuff like that. But
especially before university, I had my own thing, which was
computers and that is what I did.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: When did you start
using computers?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I started when I was
like ten or eleven. Fairly early on, and it was early enough that
you didn't have computer classes because there weren't enough
people who had computers in the early '80s. I don't know, not even
here probably. If you did computers, you mostly did it on your own.
Maybe I had one or two other people in a class who used computers,
and I met them once a week to compare notes and stuff like that. I
was never into BBSs or anything like that or the Internet,
either.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How did you get a
computer that early, then?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: My grandfather on my
mother's side owned one. He was a professor of statistics at
Helsinki University. He got a computer because, to him, it was a
programmable calculator. This was a home computer and not a very
powerful one, but compared to a calculator at the time, it was
light-years ahead. He did his own programs and had me kind of help
him. Although I wasn't much help, he liked having me around. I was
typing in programs&mdash;stuff like that. He probably wanted me to
learn, but I didn't realize that at the time. And I was doing some
playing. He wasn't interested in the games. I was reading the
manuals that came with the computer and doing simple things: typing
in example programs and expanding on those, like people did. It
didn't start off like, the first day I saw the computer I was
instantly in love. It was more like, over the years, I just spent a
lot of time on the computer until it was apparent that it was my
hobby.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3655f4.jpg"></div>
 <span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Did
you have a motorcycle when you were a kid?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Nope, I didn't have a
motorcycle. I had a bike. I don't have a motorcycle now, either.
I'm afraid of the damn things.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Are you?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Well, you feel so
unprotected on them. They are so hard to control. Just like you
have to learn to ride a bicycle, you have to learn to use a
motorbike, and I haven't.</p><p>Mopeds are really big out in the countryside. That's the way
people get around. Before you get a driver's license, you can still
get a moped. But I always lived in the absolute center of Helsinki,
so I could walk anywhere, take public transportation and whatnot.
So I never got into cars or mopeds or anything like that, and I
never owned a car until I moved here. Most places in Helsinki, a
car is more bother than it is worth. Unless you need it for some
specific reason, like transporting a kid. If we had had children
then, we probably would have bought a car.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How about sports?
Did you play football?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: No, I didn't. I was
not really bad at sports, but it was never something I found
interesting. I played basketball for a while, which was ludicrous
because I was always one of the shortest guys in my class. Whatever
I am&mdash;5 foot 8&mdash;I'm not going to be a basketball player! I played
basketball basically because my dad thought I should play a
sport.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Oh, the virile thing
again...</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Yeah, he was more of
an action kind of person. He's very intelligent, too. In fact, he
is one of the more intelligent people I know, but he has his
quirks. I was never much of a sports fan.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How about
music?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: The same. The way I
listen to music still is that I put on a radio station that is
basically classic rock most of the time.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What do you consider
classic rock?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: '60s, Beatles,
whatever. Perhaps the Beatles is a bit before what I consider
classic rock, but it's kind of borderline.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Where did you go to
university?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Helsinki University.
There are two of them: one is the Helsinki University of
Technology, which is actually not inside Helsinki but just on the
border outside. Then there is the real University of Helsinki,
which is the kind of old-fashioned, European-like university where
you have lots of courses like philosophy and languages. They do
have a technical department, too, but it's not about technology.
For example, computer sciences is really computer
<span   class="emphasis"><em>science</em></span>&mdash;it talks about complexity analysis
and things like that. I went to the real University, so I went
through all the complexity analysis, what NT completeness means and
the spherical side. That was kind of fun, and people always
wondered why I wasn't at Helsinki University of Technology which is
much more engineering-oriented. I just liked going&mdash;I also liked
math, so I fit right in at Helsinki University, and at the same
time, I had Linux as a side project&mdash;the practical side.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: When did you start
working on Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Spring of 1991&mdash;eight
and a half years ago. I had taken a course in UNIX and C, the fall
semester before. The first time I actually touched UNIX was fall
1990, when I had a UNIX course at Helsinki University. Actually, it
was the first UNIX course they ever had at Helsinki University,
because it used to be a VAX and VMS place. They had just gotten a
UNIX machine for trying out that newfangled thing, and it turned
out to be a huge success. Within a few years, they had switched
over everything to UNIX. But that first machine was used for this
small course in UNIX and C, and I immediately felt that this was
what I wanted to have. It made sense. Then when I bought a PC, I
wanted UNIX on it, and the rest is kind of history.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Was there a
particular professor who influenced you?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: There were a lot of
people who kind of had a large influence, but none who were really
fundamental. I mean, apart from my grandfather, I usually did my
own thing. I wouldn't recommend my method of study to anybody else,
as it is not very organized. It basically took me eight years to
get a degree.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: It was a master's,
right?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: It was my master's,
but it should not take people eight years to get a master's! But,
the way I study!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: So you were having
fun, right?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Hmmm, yes.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Well, social life is
important too.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Yeah. In Finland, you
can afford to take your time because universities are essentially
free, and you get subsidies from the government to study. So you
can actually live on that subsidy, even though you won't be living
well. I was also teaching at the university, being a T.A. at first,
and then a junior research assistant, then a junior research
person&mdash;slowly moving up the ranks. By the time I was starting to
get my degree, I had long since realized that I actually didn't
like writing papers. I had a hard time writing my thesis, and I
decided I couldn't stay at the university forever. Because if you
don't like writing papers, then you really don't want to stay at a
university. So, that's when I said, &ldquo;Okay&rdquo;, and started thinking
about something else, and the result was moving to the U.S.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3655f5.jpg"></div>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Well, having
computers as an early interest gives you a wide range of choices as
far as what you might do.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Well, even two and a
half years ago when Linux was new&mdash;it wasn't known like it is now;
it was known only in technical circles&mdash;I had my share of
interesting job offers. Most people, who get out of university in
Finland and go to work, start small&mdash;Nokia is obviously very big in
Finland as an employer. I had the choice of a number of very
interesting and exciting places.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How did you decide
on Transmeta?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: The timing was good.
They flew me over and gave me a tour after I signed an NDA. After
the first day, I just thought these people are crazy&mdash;they were so
far out. Then I went back to the hotel and basically slept on the
issue. By the time I came in for the second day of interviews, I
had just decided that, &ldquo;Hey, if I wanted to work for a place that
did something exciting, it had better be a bit crazy!&rdquo; Nobody else
was doing anything as exciting. At Transmeta, I had the feeling
that, &ldquo;Okay, this is a company that is doing something nobody else
in the world is doing.&rdquo; And I still think that. Even though I
can't say <span   class="emphasis"><em>what</em></span> it is, Transmeta is still a
good company to work for. You feel that, hey, we're doing something
that if it works, it will make a large difference.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Where did you and
Tove meet?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: We met at university;
she was already a kindergarten teacher, which is her real job. She
had a degree in child care, a bachelor's. She was thinking of not
necessarily being a kindergarten teacher all her life, so she was
doing other stuff too. And computer science was actually just an
interesting sideline, so we met up at University of Computer
Science. That's how we met&mdash;not very romantic&mdash;no exotic cruising
in the Mexican Gulf.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Ahh. When did you
meet her?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: About six years ago.
It was after Linux got started, but certainly long before it made a
difference to anyone else.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Was it love at first
sight?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: No.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: It's usually not,
right? Seems to me I heard something about her being a martial arts
champion or something?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Yeah, for six years
running she was the Finnish champion in karate, but she basically
stopped doing that after a while. She was into the Kata, the
forms&mdash;she was doing some fighting too&mdash;but Kata is actually doing
the forms of karate, correctly, at the right speed, with precision,
stuff like that. The competitions she went to were basically
showing what she could do.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What about the kids?
Tell us their names and ages.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Patricia is the older
one. She was born in Finland just two months before we moved, so
she is two years and eight months. Daniella is the younger one; she
is fifteen months. She was born here.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: They are very pretty
and well-behaved!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Yeah! They are very
well-behaved, and they are used to traveling. Partly because we
moved here, we didn't have grandparents to take care of them, so
wherever we go, we always take them with us. So they are used to
being outside with people and being at restaurants.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Are you planning on
having more children?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: My wife is&mdash;she is
still working on me. I'm kind of resigned to having a third one. I
like kids. There already will be more time between the second and
third than there was between the first two. I think we should wait
a bit. Life has been quite hectic with two little kids.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Is Tove wanting a
boy?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Well, she always
mentions it as a boy, and I bet that if she has another girl, she
will start talking about a fourth one!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: You better plan on
that boy, then!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I am happy with two
girls! Maybe when they've grown up a bit, I'll be ready for
another.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What about school
for the kids? Are y'all going to stay here in the states for them
to go to school?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Well, that used to be
kind of a major worry between us. We've seen some strange things.
Tove was off looking for preschools, because you start so early
here in the U.S. I looked closer at one of the papers she brought
home, and found it mentioned L. Ron Hubbard. I started asking
around about the place, and it turns out they are a scientology
school, and they don't mention the fact that they are associated
with scientology anywhere in their literature. And that kind of
makes me nervous. I don't want to put my child in a scientology
school by mistake. We have Patricia enrolled in a school with a
good name in the area, and we will see how that goes. She is
actually starting preschool this year. Assuming it all works out,
we won't have to worry about school that much, not like we used
to.</p><p>The difference between the U.S. and Finland is just huge in
that area. In Finland nobody worries about school, nobody even
thinks about it because it's obvious that you go to public school.
People who don't send their kids to public school have some
particular reason, like their kid needs special attention. There
are a few private schools that specialize in languages and stuff
like that, but it is uncommon for kids to go to those&mdash;normal
people usually don't do that. Here, you have to really think about
the issue. There are a lot of bad schools and a lot of really good
schools&mdash;it's more of a decision. Just that difference made us
nervous, so we will see.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: So you are happy
here in the U.S.?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: We are happier now.
My wife is very happy here too, though she was not at first. She
has a much closer-knit family, so our telephone bills used to be
totally horrendous. We like the area. I like it from a purely
technical standpoint, as well as the weather and things like that.
And my wife has just grown to like the area. So we'll see. We are
definitely staying here for a few more years, unless the INS puts
us out.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Well, I doubt
that!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Well, I don't
know.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: As long as you are
gainfully employed, I thought they left you alone.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: They do have certain
rules, like for example, the visa we have is for three years and we
can renew it once. In the meantime, we are trying to get a green
card, and we are supposed to be real close now, but &ldquo;real close
now&rdquo; to the INS might mean a week or four years.</p><p>This area is the worst in the entire U.S. The INS is just
completely backlogged. They've had cases where they just lost
files, and because they lost them, people who have been waiting for
a year or two find themselves starting over with the INS saying,
&ldquo;I don't actually know about you.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What do y'all do for
fun?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Usually we are so
busy, that we just take the kids out to nearby parks during the
week. On weekends, we sometimes go to a small petting zoo close by;
we are members, so we get in free. Sometimes we go to these natural
reserve areas and just walk. Most of the time, we just stay home
and go shopping and stuff like that.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: You don't even go to
movies?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: We have not been to a
movie in two and a half years!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Is this because of
the children?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: It's because of the
kids. They are just now becoming the age where we are starting to
say, &ldquo;Hey, one of these days we could go to a kid's
movie.&rdquo;</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: They have a nanny,
right?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: We have a few
babysitters; we get out sometimes. But again, we don't have
grandparents close by who would take them for an evening at the
last minute. Instead, we have to decide a week in advance to go out
next Friday and get the babysitter&mdash;basically, that never
happens.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How about fame? You
seem to handle it very well.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: It doesn't affect me
much.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: You don't get
bothered a lot?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: No. I only notice it
during the conferences. Otherwise, it happens maybe three or four
times a year&mdash;other than that, not at all.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What about all the
people like me bothering you for interviews?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: My e-mail box is a
complete disaster area! It's grown over the years from about ten
messages a day to a hundred messages a day. I've just gotten used
to it. It can be painful; going on vacation for a week means you
know beforehand that when you come back, you are going to have to
spend two days just reading e-mail.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Do you read it
all?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: No, but I try to
glance through most of it. I handle technical mail better than
non-technical mail. They are much easier! You can glance and tell
it's important and put it aside or handle it on the spot, and that
is a fairly straightforward decision to make. But for non-technical
e-mail, you say, &ldquo;Hmmm...what should I do about this?&rdquo; You don't
have time to decide and handle it right then, so you just put it
aside and forget about it.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: I think that's the
only kind of e-mail I get&mdash;the ones that need decisions. Many
people in the community think of you as a hero, a role model. Who
is yours?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I don't have any. I
never had any teen idols or anything like that. I mean, if I had to
pick anybody it would have to be my granddad. And then maybe more
of the scientist kind of people, like Einstein, people like him. I
thought that quantum physics was just the most interesting thing
when I was small. But then, that was not very personalized&mdash;there
wasn't just one person.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What kind of
influence did your granddad have on you?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I don't know; he got
me into math and computers. He was the kind of &ldquo;absent-minded
professor&rdquo; type, so often, even when he was there, he wasn't
necessarily there mentally! But at the same time, he was probably
one of the closest people to me. He died when I was 15. He was
there mainly during my early school years rather than later.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Okay, a couple of
silly questions. If you could have any car in the world, what would
it be?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Oh, God! We are
actually looking at buying a car and have picked a minivan. Yes,
it's not the sexy sports car. We're getting a lot of friends and
family over from Finland and whenever we go somewhere, we have to
take two cars and that is just a pain. So we are getting to be a
&ldquo;real American family&rdquo;, and we will have a minivan. But that was
not the answer you were looking for!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: That's okay! Would
you rather have a Porsche?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: No, I never liked
that kind of muscle car&mdash;the Corvettes, I didn't like. I find those
to be uninteresting&mdash;a toy car. I like the Miata, but it's too
small; however, the BMW Z3&mdash;that kind of car&mdash;that, I like. But
it's just too impractical when you have two kids. We have
considered maybe getting a convertible. When we moved here, we
didn't think about that, but actually in California it does make
sense much of the time. But we have to get a four-seater anyway, so
even then it's not going to be one of the really &ldquo;fun&rdquo; cars; it's
going to be one of the practical ones.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Do minivans come
with sun roofs?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Maybe sun roofs, yes,
but not convertible!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What's your favorite
color?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: It was blue when I
was small&mdash;the classic boy color. I think it's yellow now. Yellow
is a hard color, okay? You can do it too light and it just looks
pee-colored. Or you can do it too dark and it becomes too orange,
so you have to be careful&mdash;blue is safer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What message would
you like to give our readers?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Linux didn't start
out as a message to the masses. Unlike Richard Stallman, I really
don't have a message. He has one and can go on about it forever.
I'm just an engineer. Let's see: Do things well! Do them with
heart! What other strategies can I come up with...?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: That will do. Thanks
very much for taking the time to talk to me.</p></div></div>
