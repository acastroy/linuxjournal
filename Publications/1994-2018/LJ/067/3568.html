Creek for the Slackware 96 CDs. When I received the four-CD set, it
came with a tiny installation manual which I followed to the last
detail. A few hours later, I had Linux (kernel 2.0.0) running on my
PC. Since that eventful day, I have not reinstalled Linux on my
main system, so I'm still running the same system. Thus, I have a
bias toward Slackware, as it is what I use.</p><p>I have played with other distributions. Red Hat is no harder
or easier to install, and SuSE comes with a much more
novice-friendly manual. I'd recommend Slackware to those who have
more than a passing knowledge of computers and operating
systems.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Configuration &amp; Installation</em></span>
is an enhanced version of the pamphlet which is shipped with the
Walnut Creek distributions&mdash;a much enhanced version. The 560-page
book comes with two CD-ROMs. The first is the standard Slackware
installation with the 2.0.34 kernel&mdash;not the latest and greatest,
but certainly a stable version. The second CD has a number of other
packages, mostly with full source. Unlike previous versions of
Slackware in which you need to create boot disks, you can now boot
directly off the CD for your initial installation if your BIOS
supports this, and most newer ones do. The CD can also be used as a
rescue disk.</p><p>Chapter 1 (a full 43 pages) covers the hardware requirements
for a successful installation. I'm sure if your hardware problem
isn't covered here, you'll have great difficulty finding it
anywhere else. I should also point out that this version of Linux
is only for an Intel PC architecture.</p><p>Chapters 2 and 3 cover the actual installation of Linux on
your PC and configuring the X Window System. Again, a good amount
of detail is presented. In Chapter 4, the authors detail advanced
issues: recompiling a custom kernel, printers and
networking.</p><p>If you are using a laptop, you'll find Chapter 5, &ldquo;Portable
Computing Devices&rdquo;, very useful. There is not a lot of text in
this chapter; essentially, it just tells you that Linux works with
most laptops. The useful part is a list of over 500 models and
brands of laptops known to be compatible, and problems you can
expect with some combinations. Many web resources are listed for
optimizing specific models.</p><p>The remainder of the book, Chapters 6 to 9, covers Internet
issues, a summary of basic Linux commands and applications and
basic system administration.</p><p>My only complaint is some of the detail in the first half
becomes almost painful to wade through. You may find it useful in
certain situations, and as such, it is a good resource. I loaned
the book and CDs to a friend who isn't a computer guru, but is
mildly interested in trying out Linux. He's installed Windows 95/98
dozens of times, so has some knowledge. He spent a bit of time
reading the book, decided it was all too complicated, and never
even bothered trying to boot from the CD. I think my friend is more
typical than many readers of this magazine might care to admit. I
understand other distributions are addressing the fear of
installation much better than Slackware.</p><p>The second part of the book, the various overviews, are an
excellent introduction for people who haven't yet earned any UNIX
merit badges. It will not make a wizard out of a new user, but
should start them out on the correct path. I'm sure that if my
friend had simply booted the disk, followed the on-screen
instructions, then used this part of the book as a reference, he
would have managed the install quite successfully. Quite correctly,
the authors mention they are only touching on many topics and
recommend further resources.</p><p>One actual weakness I discovered in the book was the way
printers are handled. Setting up Ghostscript is covered in a short
section, but there isn't any advice on handling some fairly basic
and, to the new user, difficult problems. I can only assume the
authors had an expensive PostScript printer hooked up to their own
Linux boxes and were spared learning how to write &ldquo;stair-step&rdquo;
filters and custom printcap files. Many printer problems are easily
handled with print filters, but no mention of this is made.</p><p>Even though this book covers installation of a Slackware
Linux distribution, I do think it contains much that will benefit
new users as well as advanced users installing different
distributions. I will certainly keep it as a reference. The authors
certainly know their subject, but I have to wonder if all this
detail is necessary.</p></div></div>
