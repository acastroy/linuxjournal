for Linux is IBM's DB2. You can obtain DB2 by visiting IBM's web
site. You can order a 60-day trial, DB2 Universal Database
evaluation CD-ROM for free. There is also a Personal Developer's
Edition which is not time-limited and is also free when downloaded.
The downloads are rather large, however; the latest version's core
download is 59MB, with separate downloads for extras such as
PostScript documentation. If you don't have a fast connection to
the Internet, you would be better off ordering the evaluation
CD-ROM or pay for the Personal Developer's Edition CD-ROM, which
costs approximately $39 US.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185e580.0x1956a28"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>The version I tested was the IBM DB2 Universal Database for
Linux, Version 5.2. (Version 6.1 is now available.) It consisted of
the following products:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>DB2 Universal Database Workgroup Edition</p></li><li><p>DB2 Client Application Enabler</p></li><li><p>DB2 Software Developer's Kit</p></li></ul></div><p>as well as two books in HTML format directly on the CD-ROM:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>DB2 Quick Beginnings for
Linux</em></span></p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Installing and Configuring DB2
Clients</em></span></p></li></ul></div>

A wealth of documentation can be installed on your hard drive, not
just for installation and configuration, but for application
development and database administration.
</p><p>DB2 was developed under the 5.1 Red Hat distribution, but
should work under any distribution with the following
prerequisites.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux Kernel 2.0.35 and above&mdash;I tested on a 2.0.36
kernel, and it is reported to work on 2.2 kernel versions as
well.</p></li><li><p>A pdksh shell is required to run the DB2
command-line processor.</p></li><li><p>rpm-2.5.5</p></li></ul></div><p>IBM also recommends a minimum of 64MB of RAM and 128MB of
swap space, as that is the minimum configuration they used for
testing. I was able to function with the recommended 64MB on my
server and only 32MB on my client node.
</p><p>The installation process was relatively straightforward. You
need to install with superuser privileges. First, mount the CD-ROM
and change to the directory where it is mounted. Then enter the
command <b  >./db2setup</b> to start the installer
program. I recommend using the <b  >-d</b> flag, which
will generate a trace file called /tmp/db2setup.trc, which you can
examine in case anything goes wrong. A db2setup.log file will also
be generated in either case. My first attempt failed because the
installation program assumed that /usr/sbin was in my superuser
path. This might not be the case if you log in as a normal user and
issue the <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> command. You can fix
this by temporarily adding this directory to your path. Under bash,
for example, you would issue the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin
</pre><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>db2setup</b></span> program is a
menu-driven ncurses-type install. You should decided before hand
which components you plan on installing, depending on whether you
are installing a database server or just a client.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185e580.0x19575d8"></a>Going for a Test Drive</h2></div></div><p>The simplest situation is when the client and server are both
installed locally. You need to log on to the system as the user you
created when you made a DB2 instance during the installation. This
is most likely db2inst1, if you accepted the defaults. Move to the
/home/db2inst1/sqllib directory and execute the
<span   class="bold"><b>. db2profile</b></span> script if you are
using a bash or pdksh shell. If you are using csh, then execute
<span   class="bold"><b>.db2cshrc</b></span>. This will set up some
environmental variables. You can append this script to your
.profile file to run automatically upon login. If you haven't
created a sample database during the install process, move to the
/home/db2inst1/sqllib/misc directory and execute
<span   class="bold"><b>./db2sampl</b></span>, which will create a
test database called &ldquo;sample&rdquo;. This can take a few minutes. Now
you're ready to connect to the database and interact with it. One
way to do this is to use the Command Line Processor. You can do
this in Command Line Mode simply by prefacing all your commands
with <b  >db2</b>. An advantage to using this mode is you
remain in your shell. You can also enter the Interactive Input
Mode, by entering the <b  >db2</b>. For example, in the
Command Line Mode enter <b  >db2 connect to sample</b>.
If everything is configured correctly, you should see this on your
console:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Database Connection Information
 Database server        = DB2/LINUX 5.2.0
 SQL authorization ID   = DB2INST1
 Local database alias   = SAMPLE
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185e580.0x1957948"></a>Do It with a Java-Based GUI</h2></div></div><p>If your client is connected to the server over TCP/IP, you
can use a Java applet from your browser to access the database. To
do so, you need to use the Command Line Processor to catalog the
remote node for the client. After that, you can open the applet in
your browser by selecting Open Page from the File Menu and choosing
/home/db2inst1/java/prime/db2webcc.htm.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185e580.0x1957a50"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>I've tried to provide enough information to get you started.
One of the best things about this database is the huge amount of
information IBM provides in the on-line books as well as at their
web site. There were a few features not available in the 5.2 beta I
tested, and these were documented in README.linux. Support from the
big-name database providers removes yet another barrier to the
widespread use of Linux in corporations, and DB2 on Linux looks
like a winner.</p></div></div>
