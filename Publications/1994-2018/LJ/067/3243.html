    The persistent nature of Java servlets makes them ideal for
    database/web technology. Mr. McDonald takes a look at using
    servlets with PostgreSQL and JDBC.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1355580.0x144d3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) has
and continues to be the most commonly used method for creating
dynamic and responsive web pages. The main problem with CGI (that
stems from the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol) is that each new
client request results in a new instance of the CGI executable
being forked by the HTTP daemon. This can lead to considerable
resource consumption on web hosting machinery. Many solutions exist
to address this problem, most focusing on keeping the executable
persistent between client requests. This has the added benefit of
holding open costly resources like database and socket connections.
</p><p>Java is one of the newest kids on the block, but as a C and
C++ coder I really like some of the features of this language. Its
object model is nice, it is (relatively) portable, and the class
libraries available from both Sun and third parties are extensive.
Servlets, a rather fanciful name, is the Java answer to the CGI
problem. Servlets are Java classes, loaded and kept resident by the
HTTP daemon. When the servlet is loaded, it is initialized by a
method call; at that point, database connections can be established
and held between client requests. In addition to this, there are a
number of useful classes which facilitate the more complex
server/browser interactions such as cookies. Unfortunately, the
Servlet classes from Sun are still in a fluid state and, therefore,
code written now may be broken by future releases. This is a fact
of programming life and since this is a small application, not much
harm is likely.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1355580.0x144d558"></a>Apache and JServ</h2></div></div><p>Since my site has been running the ubiquitous Apache web
server, it was an easy choice to stick with this software. The
Servlet part was the more tricky decision. I decided to play it
safe and get the Apache-Java solution
(<a href="http://java.apache.org" target="_self">http://java.apache.org/</a>).
This is not a finished product, but it certainly looked acceptable,
and I wanted to have access to the source if anything broke.
Alternatives include Live Software's JRun and IBM's Servlet
Express. JRun is able to work with a number of web servers
including Apache and Netscape, and the code is available under a
fairly lenient license. Servlet Express is more of an unknown
quantity&mdash;that is, I did not even evaluate it since it is only
available for Apache 1.2.</p><p>The source code for JServ is available for download from the
Java-Apache site, and the version I used was 0.9.11. Unpack the
code using <span   class="bold"><b>tar</b></span> into a suitable
directory (/usr/local/lib/JServ on my machine) and read the
documentation carefully. A Makefile does most of the magic. The
Makefile does need to be edited to modify the installation
directory&mdash;alas, no <span   class="bold"><b>autoconf</b></span>. A
recent JDK is required&mdash;I used Steve Byrnes 1.1.6-5 which I have
found to be both fast and stable. I also have the
<span   class="bold"><b>tya</b></span> 1.1-3i JIT (Just In Time
Compiler) which quite transparently super-charges the execution of
Java code, but it is not necessary. Make the JServ code to compile
the Java source files to a local directory. Included in the JServ
package is the requisite Servlet code from Sun. Both the Sun
Servlet code (in the form of a jar file) and the JServ code need to
be added to your <b  >CLASSPATH</b> variable for both
development and Apache.</p><p>Now it's Apache's turn. Get a nice, recent copy&mdash;I have
1.3.1, which I find to be a splendid creation&mdash;and unpack the
source code into another directory. The magic of building an
external Apache module is described in the INSTALL file in the root
of the /apache directory. In order to compile the Apache daemon, it
is first necessary to &ldquo;configure&rdquo; the Apache build environment.
This is done through the wonderfully arcane autoconf-produced
script <span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span>. You merely need
to add the following to the ./configure line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
--add-module=/usr/local/lib/jserv/mod_jserv.c.
</pre><p>This will produce a Makefile that will copy the mod_jserv.c
file to the ./src/modules/extra directory and compile it into
Apache. Note that merely copying the mod_jserv.c file into the
extra directory will <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> accomplish anything.
In order to make this new module shared (assuming DSO in apache is
configured), add the following line to the configure command line:
<pre     class="programlisting">
--enable-shared=jserv
</pre>


This option will produce a .so shared object which is dynamically
linked to Apache when necessary.
</p><p>Obviously some care is required. I cribbed most of the
details from the apache.spec file from the apache SRPM; I advise
you to get this file and install it. Make the changes in the spec
file and rebuild the RPM (<b  >rpm -ba apache.spec</b>),
then install the new RPM. This applies only to RPM-based systems
(Red Hat, SuSE, Caldera, etc).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1355580.0x144db30"></a>Configuring and Testing Apache/JServ</h2></div></div><p><a href="3243l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>A number of tags need to be added to your httpd.conf file.
This is situated in /etc/httpd/conf in my only slightly modified
Red Hat 5.1 machine. Listing 1 is an excerpt from my file. All tags
in Listing 1 are covered in the JServ documentation, and the
JAVA_COMPILER is really only applicable to systems which have a JIT
installed. Notice that all the relevant classpaths are included:
there is no need for Swing and other such visual classes to be
present. I also set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the Java shared objects.
If your Java code relies on shared libraries not located in the
directories listed in your /etc/ld.so.conf file, then you must add
these directories to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Additionally the JServ error
log (ServletErrorLog) is an important configuration item. It is in
this file that all JServ-related errors and exceptions are dumped.
Keep an eye on the regular httpd ErrorLog file, too. During
testing, I run the command <b  >tail&nbsp;-f</b> on the
JServ error log file.</p><p>Your current Apache daemon must now be restarted. How you do
this will vary depending on your distribution, but for Red Hat
systems simply use the SysV scripts to do the magic:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd stop
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start
</pre><p>In general, it should be possible to merely kill all
instances of the httpd daemon and then rerun the new executable:
<pre     class="programlisting">
killall httpd
/usr/sbin/httpd
</pre>


Now let's get a little servlet to test the current functionality of
the JServ-enabled Apache. The Java servlet in Listing 2 illustrates
the benefits and simplicity of the servlet model. This code keeps a
counter (hits) that is reset to zero when the servlet is
initialized. Every time the servlet is invoked by Apache, the
counter is displayed and incremented. Notice that no effort is made
to keep the servlet and its data persistent.
</p><p><a href="3243l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2.</a></p><p>Every servlet must provide a
<span   class="bold"><b>service</b></span> method which gets called
whenever Apache needs to serve the URL
http://roger.dodger.org/servlet/ServletOne. The two arguments
passed, <b  >HttpServletRequest</b> and
<b  >HttpSerletResponse</b>, encapsulate the HTTP
connection. Information on HTTP-specific data such as cookies can
be manipulated with these two objects. The method
<span   class="bold"><b>init</b></span> is called only once when the
class is first loaded (or reloaded) by Apache. This initialization
method can be used to set up long-lived and potentially costly
resources. From this simple example, it can be seen that the class,
once loaded by Apache, remains persistent until it is reloaded. The
<span   class="emphasis"><em>hits</em></span> variable is initialized once (in the init
method), and is then incremented each time service is called. JServ
will reload the class if it has been modified since it was first
loaded. Sometimes it is necessary to reload the class if a change
is made to the property file; in this case,
<span   class="bold"><b>touch</b></span> the class file. This happens
quite transparently.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1355580.0x144e1b8"></a>PostgreSQL and JDBC</h2></div></div><p>Servlets are most often mentioned in the same context as
database connectivity, and rightly so. Servlets and their
persistent nature make for ideal database/web integration
technology. My first forays into this led me quickly to the
conclusion that CGI scripts were too slow for anything but
large-scale processing with databases&mdash;where the initial setup of
the database connection matched (or even exceeded) the actual
database operations. Since I was familiar with PostgreSQL which
came with my Red Hat 5.1 installation, I decided to use that RDBMS
for experimentation. I also had some experience with developing
Java database client software. The Java Database Connectivity
(JDBC) classes in the JDK (Java Development Kit) are easy to use
and somewhat portable between databases. The JDBC classes are
comprised of database-independent code (the java.sql.* classes,
part of the JDK) and database-specific code. The JDBC classes for
PostgreSQL are part of the later distributions and are necessary
for this application.</p><p><a href="3243l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3.</a></p><p>All this can be clearly demonstrated by a small JDBC example.
In order for this to be a useful example, it is necessary to have a
working PostgreSQL installation. Listing 3 is a rather dense
example that illustrates a number of JDBC issues. First, the setup
of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver (<b  >loginJdbc</b>) and
the login to the database (<b  >loginUrl</b>,
<b  >loginUser</b> and <b  >loginPasswd</b>).
The variable <b  >loginUrl</b> is often tricky to get
right (especially when learning). The last part, in this case
&ldquo;dbname&rdquo;, is the name of the database to which the connection is
being made. The latter two constants (<b  >loginUser</b>
and <b  >loginPasswd</b>) need to be changed to reflect
your database environment. Setting the permissions to the database
involves executing the command
<span   class="bold"><b>createuser</b></span> (as user postgres) and
then <span   class="emphasis"><em>granting</em></span> the needed permissions to the
user. Once the connection is established, the SQL SELECT statement
is executed and the result set is captured by the variable
<span   class="emphasis"><em>rs</em></span>. Meta-data for this result set
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>rsmd</em></span>) is then used to determine the number of
columns returned and to display the column names. The result set is
then iterated through, printing each row as strings. This example
is very simple-minded and is intended only for SQL SELECT
statements because of the result set. Be prepared for exceptions;
e.g., an exception is thrown if no columns are returned.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1355580.0x144e790"></a>The Guest Book Application</h2></div></div><p>My first guest-book application was a Perl CGI script that
kept all the guest entries in a formatted text file that was
displayed or added to as the parameters dictated&mdash;simple and
effective. Unfortunately, I wanted to do more with that
information, including linking back to the Apache log files and
maybe even handing out cookies to monitor usage. The script, which
started small and lean, began to choke on the file processing
necessary. It was also a little distressing, since I had a very
functional RDBMS installed and ready to use. I studied the
alternatives (<span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span>) and
decided to go with Servlets. The first step was to design the
tables. The most important table holds each guest-book entry on a
row.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE guest_book (
        entryid         INT NOT NULL,
        response        CHAR(8),
        name            VARCHAR(32),
        addr            VARCHAR(48),
        email           VARCHAR(24),
        time            DATETIME,
        comment         TEXT,
        PRIMARY KEY (entryid)
)
</pre><p>Each row in the guest-book table is uniquely identified by
the <b  >entryid</b> column which has an implicit index.
Additionally, the handling of these keys is handled by a key table,
a convenience in a small application but almost essential in larger
applications.
<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE key_table (
        id                      INT NOT NULL,
        val             INT DEFAULT 0,
        PRIMARY KEY (id)
)
</pre>


The key table is able to keep track of any number of keys within
the range of the <b  >int</b> type, which in my case is
[-231,231-1]. In order to get a new key, the current key must be
retrieved and then incremented. This must be atomic, i.e., the
operation must take place in a transaction. This is illustrated in
the <span   class="bold"><b>getKey</b></span> method. Ideally, a
stored procedure would handle all these details (the key-table
concept should not be visible to application developers in an ideal
world), but this level of detail with PostgreSQL involves C shared
libraries and Database APIs&mdash;something with which I did not want to
get involved.
</p><p>An additional problem that needed solving was how to provide
servlets with property files in a consistent fashion. Property
files provide a convenient way of placing data that would otherwise
be hard-coded into the application. This is done by providing a
property on the command line to JServ called base.dir which points
to a world-writable directory (but is
<b  >chmod&nbsp;+t</b> so that user's may not stomp on
other users files). This is specified in the httpd.conf file in the
<b  >ServletBinaryArgument</b> tag. In this directory you
can store property files which may be loaded by servlets. I am sure
this can be done in a smarter fashion.</p><p>The main processing entry point is the service method. From
here, either the list of entries is displayed
(<span   class="bold"><b>listEntries</b></span>), a form is displayed
(<span   class="bold"><b>showForm</b></span>) or a new entry is made
(<span   class="bold"><b>addEntry</b></span>). The code for the Guest
Book application is not shown due to space considerations, but is
included in the archive file at
<a href="../listings/067/3243.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue67/3243.tgz</a>.</p><p><a href="3243l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4.</a></p><p>Listing 4 is the property file used to set up the various
parts of the servlet. I moved a number of the HTML header and
footer strings into this file along with the JDBC configuration
parameters.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1355580.0x1445758"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The servlet/JDBC/PostgreSQL proved to be a powerful and fast
technology. Most of the problems I encountered were configuration
problems that required me to carefully read the associated
documentation. Unfortunately, technical documentation on Servlets
is scarce and I would urge further experimentation. The next step I
took with this application was to install Sybase ASE for Linux, a
RDBMS with which I am comfortable. I then coded a number of stored
procedures that allowed the Servlet to delegate most of its data
manipulation to the database, where it rightly belongs. If you are
going to replace PostgreSQL with Sybase, it is necessary to get the
jConnect JDBC classes from the Sybase web site. Of course, this can
be done with PostgreSQL, but learning the details of an RDBMS C API
was tangential to the exercise.</p><p>All listings referred to in this article are available by
