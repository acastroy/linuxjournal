to write regarding a problem I see looming on the not-too-distant
horizon.</p><p>The other night while I was trawling the Internet checking
the availability of drivers for new hardware, I discovered
something that gave me great cause for concern&mdash;the state of Linux
support for the sleeping dragon that is USB.</p><p>Like most devices in the Linux world, support takes time,
since dedicated coders often write drivers in their spare time. The
speed of support for a given device is often directly related to
the number of people needing that device. At present, Linux support
for USB appears to be zero. This is not worrying in itself, but the
development effort going into USB drivers also appears to be
virtually zero, which is worrying.</p><p>Ironically spurred on by Apple's iMac and proper support in
Windows 98, the USB has finally taken off big-time&mdash;witness the
number of USB peripherals in the shops, with new ones being
released almost daily. Again, this is not a particular problem, but
soon manufacturers will be selling PC machines without serial or
parallel ports, and probably without keyboard or mouse ports
either, relying instead on the USB versions of such devices.</p><p>Apathy in the development of USB support may yet do what the
combined might of Microsoft's strong-arm tactics has failed to
do&mdash;relegate Linux back into the pack of &ldquo;also-runs&rdquo;, as people
find they cannot use Linux on their increasingly standard
machines.</p><p>&mdash;Nick Eller bysolo@cableol.co.uk</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e10580.0x1f083a0"></a>IGEL</h2></div></div><p>In the June issue interview with me, the web address for IGEL
in Germany was misprinted. The correct addresses for our companies
are:</p><p>Americas and Canada: http://www.igelusa.com/ and
Infomatec IGEL Labs GmbH: http://www.igel.de/Infomatec AG:
http://www.infomatec.com/</p><p>Thank you very much for your continued support. Keep up the
good work!</p><p>&mdash;Hans L. Knobloch President &amp; CEO, IGEL LLC</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e10580.0x1f085b0"></a>Tech?</h2></div></div><p>Is this a technical magazine or a sales pitch? Try putting in
a few technical articles among the endless ads and Open Source flag
waving.</p><p>Each issue is getting less and less informative. You are
starting to look like <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC Magazine</em></span>. I had to
ditch <span   class="emphasis"><em>Byte</em></span>, then <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sys
Admin</em></span>. Is <i  >Linux Journal</i> next? Is
the magazine going to grow up or grow stale?</p><p>&mdash;Aaron C. Springer a.conrad@ix.netcom.com</p><p>It is true&mdash;the number of ads is rising along with the
popularity of Linux. However, the proportion of content pages has
remained about the same, because we have increased the size of the
magazine to accommodate both more content and the ads. The October
issue was 132 pages &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e10580.0x1f08920"></a>Wow!</h2></div></div><p>I have been an avid reader of your publication for almost
four years now, and you never fail to amaze me. This (August '99)
issue of <i  >LJ</i> blasts away all the other issues I
have read. In fact, I just may re-subscribe (I hope the past
problems with your fulfillment service have been resolved). What
strikes me the most from this issue is the addition of
&ldquo;upFRONT&rdquo;&mdash;very interesting and informative in a light fashion.
Keep up the extraordinary work.</p><p>&mdash;David Comeau davitron@vl.videotron.ca</p><p>Thanks for the good words. As for the subscription
fulfillment problems, we have taken subscriptions back in-house
(announced in the October issue). Things should be working much
smoother by the time this issue is out &mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e10580.0x1f08b30"></a>&ldquo;Focus on Software&rdquo; Column</h2></div></div><p>You mentioned a package called &ldquo;Ministry of Truth&rdquo; that you
reviewed in an earlier issue, which has since morphed into a
job-tracking system. Could you give me a URL for the product? I
might have a need for its new incarnation.</p><p>Thanks for the help, and thanks for the great column&mdash;it's my
favorite!</p><p>&mdash;Chris Sherbak csherbak@tuc.com</p><p>It's at http://tomato.nvgc.vt.edu/~hroberts/mot/. The package
I was talking about is the version 2 stuff. I've already used it to
create a database of systems that I work on. Happy Linuxing.</p><p>&mdash;David A. Bandel david@pananix.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e10580.0x1f08d98"></a>1024 Cylinders</h2></div></div><p>In response to a tech support question in the August issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, Mario Bittencourt said:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Using the installation's fdisk (or disk druid),
create the partitions you will need with the first one for
DOS/Windows. Then separate a small (64-128MB) partition for swap
and the rest for Linux. When you finish your installation, make
sure you pick &ldquo;MBR install&rdquo; for LILO.</p></blockquote></div><p>No dice; that won't prevent the problem. The kernel has to be
in the first 1024 cylinders, and with your solution, it will be
there only by coincidence. Build a new kernel on a very full drive,
and it'll wind up outside the first 1024 cylinders&mdash;blammo, not
bootable.
</p><p>The other solution posted (creating a /boot partition in the
first 1024 and putting your kernels there) is the best one I've
managed to come up with. I usually go for 10MB instead of 8, but 8
is good too.</p><p>&mdash;Shawn McMahon smcmahon@eiv.com</p></div></div>
