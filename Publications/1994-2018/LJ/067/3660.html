invented in the 1970s. Their technology might be old, but databases
play a crucial role in our increasingly information-laden world.
They are designed to store and retrieve information easily, quickly
and reliably.</p><p>With the growth of the World Wide Web, many more people have
begun to realize how useful a relational database can be.
Personalized web pages, shopping carts, calendar/diary sites, stock
portfolios and book recommendations are all possible because of the
marriage between databases and the Web.</p><p>While creating and publishing a web site is relatively
inexpensive, databases are normally expensive to buy, require
costly hardware, and occupy one or more full-time database
administrators. No wonder companies can charge outrageous sums of
money for a database&mdash;anyone who can afford to install and maintain
one can also afford the five-digit purchase price.</p><p>The tide is beginning to turn, however, and MySQL &amp; mSQL
are two at the forefront of a movement to popularize database use.
They can be installed within minutes, require low maintenance, and
have outstanding performance. Moreover, they support most of the
standard SQL (Structured Query Language) syntax used on larger
databases. This means anyone trained on a larger database system
will be able to apply that knowledge with MySQL &amp; mSQL. The
reverse is also true; MySQL &amp; mSQL allow someone to learn the
basics of a relational database before working with Oracle, Sybase,
DB2 and other large-scale products.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>MySQL &amp; mSQL</em></span>, new from O'Reilly and
Associates, is a good book for someone looking to use one or both
of these products. It has an excellent introduction to the theory
behind relational databases and explains data normalization&mdash;a
crucial aspect of good database design&mdash;in a relatively clear and
concise way. It describes SQL data types, giving frequent examples
of how they could be used. I normally use MySQL, and thus, the mSQL
portions of the book were irrelevant to my day-to-day work.
Nevertheless, I found it useful to see how the two differ and what
I might gain or lose by switching. Someone inexperienced with
database programming would find it hard to decide between the two,
based on the coverage given in this book.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>MySQL and mSQL</em></span> begins by describing
databases in general, and then concentrates on these two database
products in particular. The book continues with a look at database
programming from a number of perspectives, including a wide variety
of languages (C, C++, Java, Perl, Python and PHP). Finally, it
provides a reference to SQL and several language-specific
APIs.</p><p>That said, several things about <span   class="emphasis"><em>MySQL &amp;
mSQL</em></span> troubled me. I was surprised that the example CGI
programs did not use the <b  >-T</b> (taint) flag, which
can significantly increase a program's security. I would also have
preferred to see a longer description of Perl's DBI (database
interface), instead of using space for a description of the old
Mysql.pm module.</p><p>I am starting to learn Python and was happy to see that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>MySQL &amp; mSQL</em></span> included a chapter on the
subject. Unfortunately, the book did not tell me where a MySQL
module for Python could be found or which module was used in the
examples. After an hour of searches, downloads and failed installs,
I gave up. The authors could certainly have given clearer
instructions on this subject.</p><p>I was surprised that the
<span   class="bold"><b>DESCRIBE</b></span> command, which I use
extensively in my work, had only one mention in the index&mdash;and that
pointed to an empty entry in the book's SQL reference.</p><p>Beginning users probably need a short, step-by-step
demonstration of how to <span   class="bold"><b>CREATE</b></span> a
table, <span   class="bold"><b>INSERT</b></span> a row into it,
<span   class="bold"><b>UPDATE</b></span> one of its columns,
<span   class="bold"><b>DELETE</b></span> the row, and finally,
<span   class="bold"><b>DROP</b></span> the table. <span   class="emphasis"><em>MySQL
&amp; mSQL</em></span> describes such commands in great detail, but
gives few examples of interactive database commands.</p><p>Perhaps my biggest problem with <span   class="emphasis"><em>MySQL &amp;
mSQL</em></span> is its lack of attention to potential problems when
using these low-end databases. I have been using MySQL for several
years, and will continue to use it for many applications, both for
myself and my clients. But it lacks useful items such as triggers,
stored procedures and nested <b  >SELECT</b> statements.
More importantly, it lacks transactions and constraints, which help
to ensure data safety.</p><p>Relational databases typically require much horsepower and
maintenance, and the authors would have been wise to give a longer
indication of why this is the case. In particular, it would have
been nice to read more about transactions, and under what
circumstances the added expense of Oracle or Sybase pales in
comparison with corporate liability.</p><p>Despite its flaws, <span   class="emphasis"><em>MySQL &amp; mSQL</em></span> is a
welcome book. It provides far better documentation than has
previously been available for these products, and gives a push in
the right direction to programmers who are new to relational
databases. If you are interested in writing applications that use a
database, <span   class="emphasis"><em>MySQL &amp; mSQL</em></span> is a good place to
start.</p></div></div>
