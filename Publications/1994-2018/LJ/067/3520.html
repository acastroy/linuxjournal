    Configuring Linux as a dual-purpose user environment.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2335580.0x242dc38"></a></h2></div></div><p>In an era of decreasing budgets and
increasing costs, it is sometimes impossible to follow standard
wisdom and use distinct computer systems to achieve different
goals. The East Tennessee State University (ETSU) Department of
Computer and Information Sciences confronted this problem in spring
1997, when course requirements suggested the need for two computer
laboratories:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a stable computer laboratory that would support
standard classroom use, and</p></li><li><p>an experimental, Linux-based computer laboratory
(LBCL) that would allow students to change operating system source
code.</p></li></ul></div>

The obvious solution, which involved establishing separate
laboratories, could not be implemented due to space and budgetary
limitations. Therefore, ETSU system administrator Luke Pargiter
decided to establish a single networked laboratory that would
operate as an experimental or a stable platform.
</p><p>Pargiter's strategy for supporting a dual-purpose laboratory
partitioned the available computers into one trusted PC and a set
of client PCs. The trusted PC, known as the <span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel
server</em></span> PC, acted as a secure file server for the network
as a whole. The client PCs were set aside for user development.
Users were directed to use only client PCs, and to boot these PCs
according to how they intended to use the systems:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Those who wanted to use the standard Linux kernel
would use a designated bootstrap floppy that directed a user PC to
download the standard Linux kernel from the kernel server.</p></li><li><p>Those who wanted to use an experimental Linux
kernel would bootstrap their PCs from the local hard drive, where
they could store experimental kernels.</p></li></ul></div><p>Pargiter's dual-boot strategy ensured the integrity of the
standard network file system, while making it easier for an
experimental user who created a bad kernel&mdash;and, consequently,
rendered a PC unbootable from the local hard drive&mdash;to recover by
rebooting from the kernel server PC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2335580.0x242e1b8"></a>Configuration Difficulties</h2></div></div><p>Configuring the six-station network posed two key challenges.
The first one stemmed from the need to use surplus PCs with Micro
Channel Architecture (MCA) buses&mdash;a type of bus the standard Linux
2.0 kernel does not support. The MCA problem was solved by using
Chris Beauregard's MCA kernel patch from the Micro Channel Linux
home page.</p><p>A second configuration-related challenge arose from the need
to conserve disk space on the kernel server PC. Configuring the
kernel server PC as a trusted server would help ensure the
integrity of the kernel server's file system in the face of random
kernel changes applied to satellite PCs. The server, however, would
then be required to host one copy of the Linux operating system for
every networked PC, leaving little room for user home
directories.</p><p>The Linux kernel &ldquo;disk bloat&rdquo; problem was solved by
observing that most of the files in the Linux distribution could be
stored once on the server and shared among multiple PCs. This set
of shared kernel files included system-independent files like
/etc/passwd, which remain constant across the configuration, and
satellite-independent files like /etc/exports that need to be
configured only twice: once for the kernel server and once for all
client PCs.</p><p>Since Linux distributions are not ordinarily partitioned into
system-dependent and system-independent files, system-dependent
configuration files were moved to a new directory, /adm. Most of
the relocated files were originally stored in /etc. For each file
moved to /adm, a corresponding soft link pointing to that file was
created in each client's /etc directory. Trial and error was used
to determine whether a configuration file could be moved to
/adm.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2335580.0x242e3c8"></a>Server Mass Storage Device Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The principal goal of the mass storage device configuration
was to provide adequate disk space for system executables and
files, while reserving the greater portion of disk space for user
files. Initially, three mass storage devices were found on the
kernel server: a CD-ROM, a 320MB hard drive and a 545MB hard
drive.</p><p>The 320MB hard drive was configured as the default boot drive
/dev/sda. This drive was partitioned into a 50MB swap partition,
/dev/sda1, and a second partition, /dev/sda2, for the server's root
file system. The first 80MB of the 545MB hard drive, /dev/sdb1,
were reserved to house the client's operating system images,
/tftpboot/Client_IP_Address, and the directory containing shared
operating systems file, /tfpboot/adm. The remainder of the drive,
/dev/sdb2, was set aside for the server's /usr/local directory. In
retrospect, it would have been better to have partitioned /dev/sda
into three logical disks, reserving the third partition for
temporary files such as those found in the /var directory since the
demand for temporary file space changes in response to a system's
tasks.</p><p>The CD-ROM drive was included in the server's initial
hardware configuration to simplify and speed up the Linux
installation. One of the last configuration steps was to replace
the CD-ROM with a 320MB hard drive. This third hard drive,
/dev/sdc, was initialized with one partition, /dev/sdc1, intended
for user home directories, /home. The CD-ROM was then placed on a
client system, lin2, and exported to allow other clients and the
server to utilize the device.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2335580.0x242e580"></a>Server Base System Installation</h2></div></div><p>The MCA Slackware 3.1 installation boot floppy was used to
initiate the server's installation. Basic Slackware 3.1
installation instructions were followed. The standard Linux 2.0
kernel series does not provide support for the MCA bus
architecture; therefore, the kernel image residing on the MCA
Slackware 3.1 installation floppy was installed on the new system.
Upon completion of the Linux installation, the system was booted
and the MCA Linux kernel patch applied to the kernel source code.
The modified kernel source was then configured, compiled and
installed. Finally, the server was rebooted to load the new kernel
image.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2335580.0x242e688"></a>Network Preparation/Configuration</h2></div></div><p>The basic network setup was configured during the Slackware
3.1 installation as with any standard Linux system. At the time,
the Linux 2.0 kernel series did not support token-ring adapters.
However, token-ring adapter support was provided via the MCA kernel
patch. During the kernel configuration process, the following
networking support and network device support options were
selected:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>TCP/IP networking</p></li><li><p>drop source routed frames</p></li><li><p>reverse ARP</p></li><li><p>allow large windows</p></li><li><p>network device support</p></li><li><p>token-ring driver support</p></li><li><p>IBM tropic chipset-based adapter support</p></li></ul></div><p>The Slackware network initialization script,
/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1, was edited to set up the token-ring interface
(tr0). This was done by replacing the default network interface
argument Ethernet, eth0, supplied to the
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> command with tr0.
</p><p>A non-standard shell script,
<span   class="bold"><b>rarptab</b></span>, was created and placed in
the /etc directory. This script initialized the RARP (reverse
address resolution protocol) table with mappings from 48-bit MAC
(mandatory access control) addresses to IP addresses. The script
compensated for the Slackware RARP's failure to respond to clients
named in standard Linux initialization scripts. The rarptab script
consists of a single command for each client of the form</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rarp -a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Client_IP_Address</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>Client_MAC_Address</em></span>
</pre><p>The rarptab script was invoked at system boot from
/etc/rc.local, using the command
<pre     class="programlisting">
sh -c /etc/rarptab
</pre>


The server's /etc/exports file was modified to give client PCs
access to the following directories:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/adm: shared files moved from /etc</p></li><li><p>/home: user home directories</p></li><li><p>/root: superuser's home directory</p></li><li><p>/shlib: loadable libraries</p></li><li><p>/usr: system tools and user directories</p></li><li><p>/var/X11R6: XFree86 shared libraries</p></li><li><p>/var/openwin: Sun Window system shared
libraries</p></li></ul></div>

Client PCs were given read-write access to /home and /root
directories. Access to all other directories was restricted to
read-only. Entries added to /etc/exports had the following format:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Shared <span   class="emphasis"><em>Directory</em></span>  Client <span   class="emphasis"><em>Hostname</em></span> \
        (rw, no_root_squash)
Shared
        (ro, no_root_squash)
</pre>


The <b  >no_root_squash</b> option specified above is
important for diskless operation. This option allows a client's
SETUID programs to gain access to root-only accessible system
files.
</p><p>The <b  >tftp</b> entry in the file /etc/inetd.conf
was uncommented and the following line inserted in the file
&ldquo;/etc/services&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tftp 68/tcp #TFTP server
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2335580.0x2425ff0"></a>Client Base System Installation</h2></div></div><p>A directory, /tftpboot/Client_IP_Address, was created on the
server to house the files for a single client system. A soft link,
lin2, pointing to the Client_IP_Address directory, was created in
/tftpboot for convenience. The /tftpboot/adm directory was then
created to hold cross-system configuration files. Slackware's
installation routine setup was invoked, and /tftpboot/lin2
specified when prompted for an installation target. Only packages
from Section A (base Linux) and Section N (networking) were
selected. During the configuration of the client's system files,
redundant packages from Sections A and N were removed with ease.
The setup routine option for installing the Linux kernel was
refused, since kernels, by design, are loaded from specially
prepared boot floppies. The setup option to run LILO was also
refused.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2335580.0x24260f8"></a>Client System Files Configuration</h2></div></div><p><a href="3520l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1.</a></p><p>The file /etc/fstab is used to determine which file systems
are to be mounted at system boot. Remote clients on the LBLC share
the common fstab file shown in Listing 1.</p><p>Sharable system files residing in /tftpboot/lin2/etc were
removed, and soft links made to their counterparts in the
/tftpboot/adm directory. The file /tftpboot/lin2/rc.inet1 was
edited to ensure initialization of the token-ring interface (tr0).
All file system integrity checks were then removed from
/tftpboot/lin/2etc/rc.d/rc.S. The server must ensure file system
integrity, since the <span   class="bold"><b>fsck</b></span> utility
cannot be used by the client PCs to check file system integrity at
system boot; at the time such a check would occur, the file systems
have already been mounted.</p><p>Selected directories in which the contents were to reside
only on the server (NFS mounted) were removed from
/tftpboot/Client_IP_Address, using the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rm -rf /tftpboot/linwin2/var/X11R6/*
rm -rf /tftpboot/linwin2/user/*
rm -rf /tftpboot/linwin2/root/*
</pre><p>As discussed earlier, only a limited Linux installation was
placed in /tftpboot/lin2; therefore, the following directories were
created to serve as mount points to allow lin2 to import these
directories from the server:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>/tftpboot/lin2/var/openwin</p></li><li><p>/tftpboot/lin2/shlib</p></li><li><p>/tftpboot/lin2/man</p></li><li><p>/tftpboot/lin2/info</p></li></ul></div>

lin2's /etc/exports file was then edited to allow lin2 to export
the CD-ROM that would later be placed on that machine. The
following lines were added to lin2's /etc/exports:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/cdrom   lin1(rw,no_root_squash)
/cdrom     lin3(rw,no_root_squash)
/cdrom   lin4(rw,no_root_squash)
/cdrom   lin5(rw,no_root_squash)
</pre>


The <b  >chmod -R +r /tftpboot/lin2</b> command was used
to make all files in the lin2 directory tree readable by
<span   class="bold"><b>tftp</b></span>, a protocol that,
essentially, can access only world-readable files. The
configuration for lin2 was then used to configure lin3 through
lin5. A duplicate of the lin2 configuration was created for each of
the remaining clients with the commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /tftpboot/Client_IP_Address
ln -s /tftpboot/Client_IP_Address\
/tftpboot/"lin3 through lin5"
cp -Rpd /tftpboot/lin2\
/tftpboot/"lin3 through lin5"
</pre>


A few of the system configuration files were then modified to make
these files specific to their target hosts. The most notable
changes involved modifications to
/tftpboot/Client_IP_Address/etc/rc.d/rc.inet1. Specifically, two
lines in the rc.inet1 file were modified to reflect the remote
system's IP address and gateway:
<pre     class="programlisting">
IPADDR="Client_IP_Address" GATEWAY="Client_IP_Address"
</pre>


Additionally, the file /tftpboot/Client_IP_Hostname/etc/HOSTNAME
was modified to reflect each remote system's correct host name.
Finally, the file /etc/exports was modified such that the /cdrom
directory was no longer exported.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2335580.0x2426938"></a>Creation of Floppy Disks for Remote
Bootstrapping</h2></div></div><p>A two-step procedure was used to generate remote bootstrap
floppy disks for client machines. First, the kernel source residing
on the server was recompiled to include &ldquo;root file system on NFS
(Network File System)&rdquo; support. Once compilation was complete, the
newly created kernel image was moved from
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage to
/tftpboot/adm/client_boot_image_remote. A new disk was labeled and
inserted in the server's floppy drive. A dummy device, /dev/boot22,
was created with the <span   class="bold"><b>mknod</b></span>
utility. The <span   class="bold"><b>dd</b></span> utility was used
to copy <b  >client_boot_image_remote</b> to the floppy
disk. The <span   class="bold"><b>rdev</b></span> utility was then
used to set the root device for the kernel residing on the floppy
image to the dummy device /dev/boot22. The following sequence of
commands was used to create the remote bootstrap floppy
disk:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mknod /dev/boot255 c 0 255
dd if=/adm/client_boot_image_remote/zImage of=/dev/fd0
rdev /dev/fd0 /dev/boot255
</pre><p>Finally, this procedure was captured in a shell script and
used to create additional remote bootstrap floppy disks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2335580.0x2426c50"></a>Local Client Configuration</h2></div></div><p>All client systems included a hard disk configured to provide
a single 50MB swap partition, /dev/sda1. This would allow
experimental users to partition the remainder of the drive to suit
their needs when installing Linux on their systems. Because the
only CD-ROM resides on lin2, any installation of Linux to a client
system other than lin2 has to be done via NFS. To make such an
installation possible, modifications to the MCA Slackware 3.1 boot
floppy were necessary. The boot floppy was mounted under the /mnt
directory using the command</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t minix /dev/fd0 /mnt
</pre><p>The file /mnt/etc/networks was updated, changing LOCALNET to
IP address 151.141.99.0. The MCA Slackware 3.1 boot floppy assumes
that if a network installation is being conducted, the network is
of type Ethernet. Therefore, it was necessary to edit the file
/mnt/usr/lib/set/INSNFS, changing all occurrences of eth0 to tr0.
As with the remote bootstrap floppy, a script was written to
automate the above operations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2335580.0x2426e08"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The declining cost of disk drives, together with concerns
about system security, have made diskless workstation operation and
remote protocols like RARP less attractive. &ldquo;Relatively
inexpensive&rdquo;, however, is still not quite &ldquo;free&rdquo;. We described a
strategy for implementing a Linux-based laboratory that, in effect,
uses diskless operation to support regular as well as standard
users, at no additional cost.</p><p>ETSU's Linux-based computer lab has not been fully integrated
into the ETSU curriculum, due primarily to unforeseen delays
including equipment outages caused by a thunderstorm. The lab,
however, is operational. Two students used the lab in spring 1998
to develop a serial line driver for a senior-level operating
systems course. Currently, plans are being made to use the
laboratory as a tool for teaching graduate operating systems and
undergraduate networking courses in the coming academic
year.</p></div></div>
