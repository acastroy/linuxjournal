    From personal tool to a popular Apache module, it is now in version 4
    beta.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x144b580.0x15433f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>If you've never heard of PHP, you're
certainly not alone. However, you've probably visited one of the
many sites driven by PHP, such as the widely popular Linux
application portal Freshmeat.net.
</p><p>PHP is a server-side HTML-embedded scripting language that
allows developers to build web applications. PHP's features are
comparable to Microsoft's ASP (Active Server Pages) and VBScript.
Both PHP and ASP are interpreted scripting tools that allow HTML
and code to be mixed in the same file. Both have effective APIs for
building database-driven applications. However, unlike ASP, PHP is
open source and cross-platform. PHP can run on Windows NT under
Microsoft's IIS web server or on any UNIX variant as an Apache
module or CGI.</p><p>PHP, which stands for &ldquo;Personal Home Page&rdquo;, was originally
developed by Rasmus Lerdorf as a macro tool for tracking visitors
to his home page. It grew from its simple roots into a complete
tool for building web applications by version 3. Released in June
1998, PHP version 3 (often referred to as &ldquo;PHP3&rdquo;), was primarily
developed by Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski.</p><p>Since then, PHP has continued to grow in popularity. It's not
possible to determine exactly how many PHP-powered sites there are,
but NetCraft's survey data suggest that over 500,000 web sites are
running PHP. Additionally, E-Soft's Apache module survey shows over
100,000 PHP-enabled Apache servers. E-Soft anticipates PHP will
become the leading add-on module for Apache, ahead of extensions
for FrontPage and <span   class="bold"><b>mod_perl</b></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x144b580.0x1543660"></a>PHP 4.0 and Zend</h2></div></div><p>Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski began working on version 4 in
November 1998. Version 4 is a complete rewrite of PHP's scripting
engine. Unlike PHP 3.0, the new &ldquo;Zend&rdquo; scripting engine bundled
with PHP 4.0 is a separate product. Eventually, Zend will be used
for other scripting applications. (Incidentally, the name &ldquo;Zend&rdquo;
is derived from the the developers' names: Zeev and Andi.)</p><p>The most significant change in version 4 is a dramatic
increase in speed. The Zend team posted preliminary benchmarks of
PHP/Zend and ASP/VBScript. Due to the similarities in concept, ASP
is considered PHP's greatest source of competition. The various
test cases show PHP/Zend running significantly faster than ASP on
identical hardware under Windows NT/SP4 and IIS.</p><p>Performance was not the only design issue with Zend. Asked
what other design goals he had for PHP/Zend, developer Zeev gave
the following list:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Complete platform independence&mdash;in both operating
system and web server.</p></li><li><p>Modular design&mdash;PHP 4.0 is well split into
components that communicate with each other through standard
interfaces (compiler, executor, web server abstraction layer,
function modules, etc.)</p></li><li><p>Stability and scalability (an almost direct result
of the modular design).</p></li><li><p>New extendibility through object-oriented (OO)
overloading support. For example, PHP 4.0 natively supports OO
syntax for accessing Windows COM objects and is likely to support
CORBA components in the future.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x144b580.0x1543b30"></a>New and Improved</h2></div></div><p>PHP 4.0 includes a variety of new features. A command-line
interactive debugger will be included that supports break points
and stepping through scripts. The debugger has not yet been
released as of PHP 4.0 Beta 2.</p><p>Support for Windows COM objects has also been added, giving
developers access to the wide variety of available Windows server
components.</p><p>Because of the new automatic resource deallocation, resources
don't need to be freed within the script, since they are freed as
soon as they are deallocated. This is similar to Java's garbage
collection. Note that PHP 3.0 will also free resources
automatically, but not until after the script is finished
processing.</p><p>New syntax changes include support for a
<b  >foreach</b> loop. Additionally, the terms &ldquo;true&rdquo;
and &ldquo;false&rdquo; are now predefined. Pointers can now be implemented
allowing two variables to represent the same variable.</p><p>New output buffering allows developers to abort a page after
processing has begun. This simplifies proper error handling in
scripts.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x144b580.0x1543df0"></a>The Roadmap</h2></div></div><p>In March of this year, a closed beta was released to PHP
developers and a handful of other sponsors. The first public beta
of PHP 4.0 was released in July, followed by Beta 2 in
August.</p><p>Feedback from the first beta release was very positive. The
official word from Zeev Suraski on the release date for 4.0:
&ldquo;We'll release PHP 4.0 once it is stable enough for users.&rdquo; The
remaining work is checking all the PHP modules to make sure they're
PHP 4.0-compatible. After this is complete, PHP 4.0 should be ready
for release. Most likely, this will be before the end of the
year.</p><p><a href="3649s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
