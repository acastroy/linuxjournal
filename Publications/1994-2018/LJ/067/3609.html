        A look at the MySQL database&mdash;where it's been, where it is now, and where it's going.
      </p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3609f1.jpg"></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b3580.0x22ab710"></a></h2></div></div><p>MySQL's history goes back to 1979 when
TcX, the company that developed MySQL, started working with
database programs. This first version was a screen
builder/reporting tool written in BASIC. At that time,
state-of-the-art computers had 4MHz Z80 processors and 16KB of RAM.
This tool was moved to UNIX and further developed during the
following years. In the mid-1990s, we started having problems with
customers who liked the results the tool produced but wanted
something they had heard about before (a buzzword was needed). So
we started looking at making an SQL (an appropriate buzzword) front
end to our low-level libraries. We found mSQL, but it did not work
for our purposes. So we started to write an SQL engine from
scratch. However, since the mSQL API was useful, we used it as the
basis for our own API. This made it easy to port some applications
we needed that were available for the mSQL API.</p><p>Since this tool would be usable by others, we decided to
release it according to the business model pioneered by Peter
Deutsch at Aladdin Enterprises with Ghostscript. This copyright is
much more free than the mSQL copyright and allows commercial use as
long as you don't distribute the MySQL server commercially.</p><p>It is not perfectly clear where the name MySQL came from. We
have used the prefix &ldquo;my&rdquo; for libraries and path names since the
mid-1980s. The main MySQL developer's daughter is named My&mdash;a
fairly common name among Swedish-speaking Finns&mdash;so naming our
database MySQL was very natural.</p><p>In May 1996, MySQL version 1.0 was released to a limited
group of four people, and in October 1996, MySQL 3.11.1 was
released to the public as a binary distribution for Solaris. A
month later, a Linux binary and the source distribution were
released. The MySQL release included an ODBC driver in source form.
This also included many free MySQL clients ported to MySQL.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b3580.0x22ab920"></a>Platforms</h2></div></div><p>The initial version of MySQL worked only on Linux and
Solaris. The biggest problem in porting to other platforms was that
MySQL needed a working POSIX thread library; in January 1997 a
modified version of MIT-pthreads was included in the
distribution.</p><p><a href="3609t1.html" target="_self">Table 1.</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b3580.0x22abad8"></a>MySQL Language APIs</h2></div></div><p><a href="3609t2.html" target="_self">Table 2.</a></p><p>To be able to use MySQL from your favorite language, you need
an API. The first MySQL version included only C and Perl APIs. Now
there are many (see Table 2). With the exception of the Java API,
all of these use the C API to communicate with the MySQL server.
So, as you can see, MySQL can be used from many popular
languages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b3580.0x22abc90"></a>MySQL Benchmarks and crash-me</h2></div></div><p>When we had gotten a nice working system, we wanted to test
it against old versions and against other databases, so we started
looking for good benchmarks. We found that most benchmarks (like
the TCP ones) represent an SQL server's performance as a single
number, often as transactions/second. We regard these to be almost
worthless, since comparatively few users run applications that do
the same thing as these benchmarks. There is usually no way to
determine your application's performance from the numbers given by
this type benchmark.</p><p>The MySQL benchmarks are designed to show how fast a SQL
server is for common operations, such as establishing a connection,
performing simple inserts or joining two tables using a key. This
also makes it possible to calculate loads on a web site when you
know the mix of operations. Of course, you need to actually
understand your own application to judge its performance with any
database.</p><p>Over time, we got many requests on the MySQL mailing lists
about MySQL's features and how it compares feature-wise with other
databases. As Michael (the main developer) didn't want to dig into
old inaccurate reference manuals to find this out, he thought of a
program that automatically detects what a SQL server has to offer.
He also thought it would be a nice test of how stable the MySQL
code is when you start to send it &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; queries.</p><p>While working with the benchmarks, we needed a list of
capabilities for all supported databases. Since doing this by hand
was <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> tedious, we made a tool to do it
automatically. While trying early versions of this tool on some
different servers, bad things happened&mdash;the servers crashed. All
this crashing led us to name this tool
<span   class="bold"><b>crash-me</b></span>. In fact, the only SQL
server that has gone through this testing without crashing is
Oracle. Of course, all bugs found in MySQL were fixed
immediately.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>crash-me</b></span> (and the
benchmarks) are implemented as a Perl DBI/DBD program that sends
thousands of queries to a database to find out how things work in
real life. By doing this, it finds many limits in the server, such
as the supported column/query/variable/index lengths.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>crash-me</b></span> is also a nice tool
for helping you write portable SQL, since it can provide a list of
which functions, types and limits exist in the server you wish to
use. Currently, we have crash-me results from Adabas-D, Access,
DB2, Empress, Informix, MS-SQL, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Solid
and Sybase. As the crash-me table is big and very detailed, we will
not include it here, but it is available at
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/crash-me-choose.htmy" target="_self">http://www.mysql.com/crash-me-choose.htmy/</a>.</p><p>What operations does the benchmark test? First and foremost,
the basic SQL operations are tested: <b  >INSERT</b>,
<b  >UPDATE</b>, <b  >DELETE</b> and
<b  >SELECT</b>. Other tests include a connect followed
by a select, and creation of tables and indexes.</p><p>The individual tests should give a good indication of how
fast an SQL server is for that specific operation. Do not use the
&ldquo;total time&rdquo; as an overall measure of the value of an SQL server.
This is because the tests are not weighted against each other. Some
tests are run more times with different options and numbers of
rows. An SQL server may be extremely bad at some &ldquo;unimportant
things&rdquo;, while it's very good at the things for which you actually
intend to use it.</p><p>We use the total time to compare things like the same
database engine on different operating systems. We also use it to
see how new versions of MySQL stack up against old ones.</p><p>Since all benchmark tables take even more space than the
crash-me results, we include only a few observations on how well
MySQL runs on different platforms.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Linux 2.2 is much faster than Linux 2.0 on a
multi-CPU machine. This is because the Perl and the MySQL server
run on different processors and the new SMP code is faster.</p></li><li><p>Linux is 7% faster than Windows 98 and 49% faster
than NT on the same machine.</p></li><li><p>Windows 98 is 27% faster than NT on the same
machine.</p></li><li><p>A Pentium II 400MHz machine running Linux 2.2 is
much faster than a Sun Ultrasparc 2/CPU 400MHz machine running
Solaris 2.7. The primary reason for this difference is that Linux
caches the file system much better than Solaris; this result might
be different under higher load. We will include a threaded test in
the next generation of benchmarks to test things like this.</p></li><li><p>If you do many inserts on Solaris, you will get
only a 22% speed increase by upgrading your processor speed by
100%.</p></li><li><p>The overhead of using MyODBC, and probably any ODBC
driver, is at least 19%.</p></li></ul></div><p>Note that while benchmarking, it was still possible to work
on the Linux machine without any problems. However, NT became so
slow that it was impossible to do any other work, even simple
editing. It took about 30 times longer to start up a new DOS
window, and we had to wait 10 seconds or so before typed characters
showed up.
</p><p>There are still many things to be done for both crash-me and
the benchmarks. For example, we would like crash-me to report if
there are identical functions that do the same thing (such as,
instead of <span   class="bold"><b>CONCAT</b></span> one can use
&ldquo;||&rdquo;). Also, many new tests should be added to test which
sub-select constructs an SQL server allows. Of course, the
documentation and presentation of the results could be much
improved.</p><p>Both these tools give invaluable information to any developer
who uses more than one SQL server. If they do not test the feature
you need, please contribute a new test. More test results can be
found at
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/benchmark.html" target="_self">www.mysql.com/benchmark.html</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b3580.0x22ac9f8"></a>Why MySQL Is Fast</h2></div></div><p>If you checked out the benchmark page above, you will notice
that MySQL is many times faster than the competition on almost
everything. Why is this so? Some of the speed comes from things
that are not supported in MySQL, such as transactions, foreign keys
and triggers.</p><p>Because the MySQL server is coded mainly by one person with
many years of coding experience, very little redundant code is in
it. Most of the basic algorithms also come from an era of slow CPUs
and small amounts of memory. The algorithms have mostly been
extended to use larger caches if there is available memory.</p><p>As a result, MySQL has a compact fast design (the code size
of the server is less than 1MB on an i386) which normally uses very
little memory, but can be configured to take advantage of large
amounts of memory.</p><p>MySQL has many useful optimizations for maximum speed. Some
examples are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Most joins are done in one sweep.</p></li><li><p>Very few normal joins require temporary tables.
Joins involving a <b  >GROUP BY</b> and an <b  >ORDER
BY</b> on something other than the
<b  >GROUP&nbsp;BY</b> part will create a (usually
memory-based) temporary table.</p></li><li><p>Memory-based temporary tables have dynamic
hashing.</p></li><li><p>MySQL has a user configurable key cache and a
record cache to quickly scan tables. Open tables are cached in a
table cache.</p></li><li><p>An index optimizer quickly finds which possible
index to use with a specific <b  >WHERE</b>
clause.</p></li><li><p>A range optimizer finds the range for an index
which will then be used to find the matching rows. The range
optimizer can optimize queries that use a combination of
<b  >&gt;=</b>, <b  >&gt;</b>,
<b  >=</b>, <b  >&lt;=</b>,
<b  >&lt;</b> and <b  >LIKE</b> (of type
&ldquo;keyword%&rdquo;) on a key column. When many possible indexes can be
used, the range optimizer will choose the index that matches the
smallest number of rows.</p></li><li><p>A join optimizer rearranges the tables in a
<b  >SELECT</b> statement in the optimal order. In the
rare case the MySQL join optimizer gets this wrong, one can force
the optimizer to join the tables in a particular order with the
<b  >STRAIGHT_JOIN</b> keyword.</p></li><li><p>For each sub-join, a simple
<b  >WHERE</b> is constructed to get a fast
<b  >WHERE</b> evaluation for each sub-join and to skip
records as soon as possible.</p></li><li><p>A <b  >WHERE</b> optimizer removes
constant conditions.</p></li><li><p>Early detection finds invalid constant expressions.
MySQL quickly detects that some <b  >SELECT</b>
statements are impossible and returns no rows.</p></li><li><p>SQL functions are implemented through a highly
optimized class library. Almost all parsing and calculating is done
in a local memory store. No memory overhead is needed for small
items, and the normal slow memory allocation and freeing is
avoided. Memory is allocated only for unexpectedly large strings by
using <span   class="bold"><b>malloc</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>free</b></span>.</p></li><li><p>In queries of type
<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT ... WHERE col IN (a,b,c,d,e,f,...)
</pre>

</p></li><li><p>the <b  >IN</b> part is sorted and
checked through binary searching.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>MIN</b></span>/<span   class="bold"><b>MAX</b></span>
on an indexed column is done with one key fetch.The MIN/MAX
optimizer can also find the best value when one has specified all
preceding index columns in the <b  >WHERE</b> condition:
<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT MAX(index_part2) FROM tbl_name WHERE
index_part_1=constant;
</pre>

</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>COUNT(*)</b></span> on a
single table without a <b  >WHERE</b> is retrieved
directly from the table information.</p></li><li><p>If all used columns for some table are numeric and
form a leftmost prefix for some key, the values may be retrieved
from the index tree rather than the data file for greater
speed.</p></li><li><p>Indexes are used to find rows matching
<pre     class="programlisting">
WHERE index_column LIKE "prefix%".
</pre>

</p></li><li><p><b  >GROUP BY</b> and
<b  >DISTINCT</b> are optimized by creating a temporary
<b  >HEAP</b> table with the <b  >GROUP BY</b>
(or whole row) as a unique index.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>INSERT DELAYED</b></span>
inserts rows in a queue to the SQL server, which is useful if you
are using MySQL for logging and can't afford to wait until the
INSERT is completed.</p></li><li><p>Index compression is used to get smaller and faster
indexes.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b3580.0x26a6770"></a>No Transactions and Many Simultaneous
Users</h2></div></div><p>One of the design decisions that has resulted in the greatest
number of questions is the lack of transactions. There are, of
course, applications that require transactions to work, but a wide
range of applications work very well without them.</p><p>Some people believe that since MySQL does not support
transactions, it cannot support many simultaneous users. Each MySQL
client gets a dedicated thread in the MySQL server, which allows
different users to access the same tables at the same time. All
MySQL operations are atomic: no other users can change the result
for a running query.</p><p>When designing MySQL, we had a greater need for speed than
for transactions. It's no use having transactions if the SQL server
becomes so slow it's unusable for what you need to get done.</p><p>Another common misunderstanding is that transactions provide
extra robustness through the redo logs. This extra security can be
had by simple means in MySQL. That is, do normal backups and then
apply the update log to the backup. The update log is a file
containing all SQL statements that change any data.</p><p>MySQL also has external utility programs to check, optimize
and repair individual tables.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b3580.0x26a69d8"></a>MySQL User Base</h2></div></div><p>As MySQL has about 50 mirrors over the world, and we don't
get download statistics from them, it's hard to tell how many MySQL
installations are out there.</p><p>The WWW and FTP log at
<a href="http://www.mysql.com" target="_self">http://www.mysql.com/</a>
gives us the information shown in Tables 3 and 4; all counts are
based on the number of distinct IPs.</p><p><a href="3609t3.html" target="_self">Table 3.</a></p><p><a href="3609t4.html" target="_self">Table 4.</a></p><p>In the Linux community, many sites use MySQL as a back end
for dynamic web pages. Among those are
<a href="http://slashdot.org" target="_self">http://slashdot.org/</a>,
<a href="http://freshmeat.net" target="_self">http://freshmeat.net/</a> and
<a href="http://www.linux.com" target="_self">http://www.linux.com/</a>.</p><p>On linux.com, every page does somewhere between 10 and 20
queries to the database. And linux.com does anywhere between 500K
and 800K page views per day. They run MySQL on its own server, a
dual Xeon system with huge amounts of RAM and hard-disk
space.</p><p>While writing this, I asked <i  >Linux Journal</i> what they use as a web back end, and learned
they also use MySQL. Among the awards we have been given, we highly
value the &ldquo;Most Used Database&rdquo; 1998 award we got from
<span   class="emphasis"><em><i>Linux Journal</i>'</em></span>s readers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b3580.0x26a7008"></a>Where MySQL Is Today</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Client/server</p></li><li><p>Multi-threaded, multi-user and very fast</p></li><li><p>APIs to many different languages</p></li><li><p>A good, free ODBC driver</p></li><li><p>Very portable</p></li><li><p>Many different column types which support all ANSI

Over
time, MySQL will be 100% ANSI 92 compatible. As we still want MySQL
to be fast, we will always give the user the option of specifying
the removal of features which make a normal SQL server slow.</p><p>As an example, the GRANT system will not have any speed
impact unless you use this to restrict table or column
access.</p><p>The current &ldquo;TODO&rdquo; list can be found in the MySQL manual at
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/doc.html" target="_self">www.mysql.com/doc.html</a>.
Everything in this list is in the order we plan to implement
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21b3580.0x25b9a70"></a>The MySQL License</h2></div></div><p>We have worked many years with GNU/BSD and other programs
from the Net and have always believed that programs should be
available in source. Because of this, we chose to use the same
license as Aladdin GhostScript for the MySQL server on UNIX, and we
made the client's completely free.</p><p>By the time this article reaches publication, there should be
an old version of MySQL (3.20) with a GPL copyright available. We
will continue releasing old versions under the GPL.</p><p>This means that for normal (even commercial) internal use on
UNIX systems, MySQL costs nothing. You do not have to pay us if you
do not want to. A license is required only if:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>You sell the MySQL server directly or as a part of
another product or service.</p></li><li><p>You charge for installing and maintaining a MySQL
server at some client's site.</p></li><li><p>You include MySQL in a distribution that is
non-redistributable, and you charge for some part of that
distribution.</p></li><li><p>You use MySQL on a Win32 (Windows 95, 98, NT or
Windows 2000) system.</p></li></ol></div><p>For circumstances under which a MySQL license is required,
you need a license per machine that runs the
<span   class="bold"><b>mysqld</b></span> server. However, a
multiple-CPU machine needs only one license, and there is no
restriction on the number of MySQL servers that can run on one
machine, or on the number of clients concurrently connected to a
server running on that machine.
</p><p>The following points set forth the philosophy behind our
licensing policy:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The SQL client library should be totally free so
that it can be included in commercial products without
limitation.</p></li><li><p>People who want free access to the software into
which we have put much work can have it, as long as they do not try
to make money directly by distributing it for profit.</p></li><li><p>People who want the right to keep their own
software proprietary, but also want the value from our work, can
pay for the privilege.</p></li><li><p>That means normal in-house use is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span>. But if you use MySQL for something
important to you, you may want to help further its development by
purchasing a support contract or by contributing documentation,
code samples or something else.</p></li><li><p>Our policy is that no one should have to pay for
normal upgrades. In the future, we may require a new license for
major upgrades with major new features (like transaction support).
This means that in the long run, MySQL will be a very good
investment compared to other databases.</p></li></ul></div><p>As Win32 is a highly commercial OS with very high development
costs (and development pains), we see no other alternative than to
provide MySQL-Win32 only to paying customers, users who have helped
us with MySQL in some way or users who think they can contribute to
any part of MySQL. If we did this in any other way, we could not
afford to continue developing MySQL on Win32 or even keep this
version up to date with the UNIX version. In effect, we let users
who run Win32 pay for the development of tools of our other
operating systems.
