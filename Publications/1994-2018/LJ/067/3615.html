piece of software that everyone is dying to see. Before you
release, however, you want to get rid of as many bugs as possible.
You know you have a certain bad habit you learned in C, the one you
have to go back and fix time, after time since you keep forgetting
you're writing in C++ now.
</p><p>Enter <span   class="emphasis"><em>CodeWizard</em></span> by ParaSoft, a tool
that searches through your code for violations of good C++ coding
standards. Based on programming ideas from Scott Meyers' books
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Effective C++</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>More Effective
C++</em></span>, CodeWizard automatically enforces thirty-five
descriptive rules or &ldquo;items&rdquo; for effective C++
programming&mdash;standards that significantly reduce the number of
errors in your code. In addition to Meyers' rules, ParaSoft has
included a list of thirty-six additional items.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3615f1.large.jpg"><img src="3615f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Rule Violation Message
</p></div></div><p>What kind of rules are we talking about? First of all, the
items have each been given a rating according to the severity of
the rule. The five ratings, from least serious to fatal, are:
Informational, Possible Violation, Violation, Possible Severe
Violation and Severe Violation (see Figure 1). An example of an
Informational rule is item 2 under the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Effective
C++</em></span> list: &ldquo;Prefer iostream.h to stdio.h.&rdquo; So, for
instance, if you include stdio.h in your code, one of the warnings
that will come up will explain that you shouldn't use stdio.h when
coding in C++ (see Figure 2). A Possible Violation is rule #17:
&ldquo;Check for assignment to self in operator=.&rdquo; Item #22 catalogs a
Violation: &ldquo;Pass and return objects by reference instead of by
value.&rdquo; A Possible Severe Violation is something like, &ldquo;Don't try
to return a reference when you must return an object.&rdquo; Severe
violations can prove to be fatal to your program. Rule #10 is a
good example: &ldquo;Write delete if you write new.&rdquo; Seems obvious, of
course, but you may forget it and thus cause ugly memory leaks. The
items are divided into different categories, such as &ldquo;Shifting
from C to C++&rdquo;, &ldquo;Memory Management&rdquo; and &ldquo;Inheritance and
Object-Oriented Design&rdquo;.</p><p><a href="3615f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2. C++ Code that Violates a
Rule</a></p><p>CodeWizard came with some instructions on installation and
basic usage. The distribution file is a tar file&mdash;it's up to you to
manually copy it over from the CD and unpack it. A graphical
installation program would come in handy for less experienced users
(although you probably won't be using the UNIX version of
CodeWizard, if you aren't familiar with a UNIX shell and basic
commands). You can configure CodeWizard as either root or a regular
user&mdash;both ways worked fine for me. A license is required, which
must be obtained from ParaSoft. The
<span   class="bold"><b>pslic</b></span> program, the ParaSoft
License Manager, will give you a machine ID and a network ID, which
you give to ParaSoft. In return, you'll receive an expiration date
and a password which will unlock CodeWizard. I'm sure there's an
easier way to manage licenses, one that doesn't require contacting
ParaSoft, but this method minimizes pirating (which is, of course,
a concern only for commercial software vendors&mdash;the GPL is
beautiful in that it completely shatters software piracy).</p><p>You use CodeWizard in place of your compiler on the command
line. Instead of typing</p><pre     class="programlisting">
g++ project.c -o project
</pre><p>you would use
<pre     class="programlisting">
codewizard project.c -o project
</pre>


You can set the compiler for CodeWizard to use in a configuration
file. CodeWizard then scans your code for any of the violations in
its rule set. On a side note, you can suppress any of the rules (in
case some of them make no sense when applied to your particular
project), or you can add your own rules using RuleWizard (see
Figure 3). There is a Motif GUI program, Insra (see Figure 4), that
displays the error messages and allows you to open the source
files, make any necessary changes, rebuild the program and retest
the code for violations. If you want to keep everything strictly
console-based, however, you can do that as well.
</p><p><a href="3615f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3. Rule Wizard
Screen</a></p><p>All in all, I'd have to say that CodeWizard can be an
incredible help in C++ coding. A Java version is available as well,
and with the ability to add your own rules, you could foreseeably
use it for almost any other language as well. Though it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> expensive, if you're serious about your
C++, this would be a wise investment.Version 3.0 is due out in
September.</p><p><a href="3615f4.jpg" target="_self">Figure 4. Motif Program
