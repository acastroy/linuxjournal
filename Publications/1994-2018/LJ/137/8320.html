802.1x on Linux with xsupplicant</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">

Many of the well-known problems in 802.11 security are quite old and
can be addressed by using 802.1x appropriately. Here's the client side.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6c348"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When WEP's flaws became apparent, the wireless
industry started developing new protocols to address
the published weak points. These new protocols grew
up around the IEEE 802.1x framework, which is a way
of using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
and all of its methods on a LAN link. 802.1x client
software programs, called supplicants, were brought
to market by operating system vendors as well as by
third-party developers.
</p><p>
Linux, however, initially was left out of the
802.1x frenzy. Network administrators who supported
power users were forced to rely on manual WEP-based
solutions with MAC address filtering or VPNs to secure
Linux before supplicants were widely available.
Happily, now two open-source supplicants are
bringing high-quality wireless security to Linux.
This article describes the process of setting up
xsupplicant, which is also known as Open1X.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6c4a8"></a>
Wireless Extensions</h2></div></div><p>
The wireless extensions API originally was designed
to provide a unified way of having programs interact
with drivers. Like any API, it saves developers
from having to know the details of how to interact
with every card. 802.1x supplicants, for example,
are able to use a wireless extensions system call to
set keys, rather than using card-specific calls for
every card that exists.
</p><p>
The wireless extensions interface has gone through
several versions. WPA support was added in wireless
extensions version 18 (WE-18). Some distributions
using the 2.6 kernel already have WE-18 support.
Older kernels need to be patched, however. My test
laptop runs Slackware, which still is using the 2.4
kernel. The 2.4 kernel has support for version 16
of wireless extensions, but patches are available for
version 2.4.30. Patch download locations appear in
the on-line Resources for this article.
Begin by applying two patches to the kernel source:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# patch -p1 ~/iw249_we17-13.diff
patching file include/linux/netdevice.h
patching file include/linux/wireless.h
patching file include/net/iw_handler.h
patching file net/core/dev.c
patching file net/core/wireless.c
# patch -p1 ~/iw240_we18-5.diff
patching file include/linux/wireless.h
patching file net/core/wireless.c
</pre>
</p><p>
To keep modules straight, I often find it helpful when patching kernels
to edit the Makefile to include an extra version number in addition to
the patch level. My wireless extensions 18 kernel is built as 2.4.30WE18.
</p><p>
The most common tools used with wireless extensions are the wireless toolset, and the most common tool you will use is iwconfig. Wireless tools
version 28 is the current version and supports WE-18. Grab the source
code from the Web site (see Resources). A simple
<tt  >make</tt>
command builds the tools.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6c768"></a>
Getting the Driver Going</h2></div></div><p>
Many cards are supported under Linux, but a handful
of drivers have captured the bulk of the popularity:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
MADwifi, the Multi-band Atheros Driver for Wi-Fi:
Atheros-based cards have some of the best hardware
support for 802.11a networking. Chances are good
that if your card supports 802.11a, it uses an
Atheros-designed chip.
</p></li><li><p>
Intel IPW drivers for Centrino chipsets: Intel
sponsors open-source driver development projects for
the various Centrino chipsets. Due to the sheer number
of Centrino chipsets on the market, these drivers
are widely used.
</p></li><li><p>
orinoco_cs: the first widely used 802.11 card was
the Orinoco Gold card, based on the Hermes chipset.
These cards were sold under a variety of names,
and they all performed quite well in their day. Although the
radio performance and throughput of these cards is
no longer cutting-edge, the driver is well
understood and often serves as a testbed for new
ideas.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This article is not meant to be a definitive treatment
of working with drivers. I use Atheros-based cards
because I have an 802.11a network at home and want
a dual-band card for packet analysis. Therefore,
I am writing about MADwifi.
</p><p>
MADwifi has not released any packaged source files.
To use the driver, you must download the code from
CVS. The build files distributed with MADwifi
use your current kernel. If you have patched
the kernel to update wireless extensions, reboot
before building MADwifi:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:
&#8618;/cvsroot/madwifi co madwifi
$ cd madwifi
$ make

root@bloodhound:/home/user/madwifi# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Atheros-based cards do not use firmware. Instead,
they have a binary-only object called the hardware
abstraction layer (HAL). Atheros has interpreted
FCC regulations in such a way that requires the
HAL to be kept closed-source. The HAL serves the same
purpose as firmware on other cards&mdash;it implements
low-level operations for the driver. The HAL
is distributed as a uuencoded file, so you must
install the uudecode program to install the HAL.
It probably is in the shell archive utilities package
for your distribution, but the location may vary.
The OpenBSD Atheros driver includes an open-source,
reverse-engineered HAL, but it has not been ported yet
to Linux.
</p><p>
The kernel modules built as part of the process are
installed in your modules directory. The driver
includes its own 802.11 support layer composed of
the modules wlan, wlan_wep, wlan_tkip and so on.
The hardware-specific part of MADwifi is composed of
modules that begin with the prefix ath_: the driver
ath_pci, the HAL ath_hal and rate adaptation algorithms
(ath_rate_*). All the modules are installed in the
net/ directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6cc90"></a>
Testing the Driver</h2></div></div><p>
In addition to having up-to-date wireless support in
the kernel, you need to have a properly configured
wireless networking subsystem. Many &ldquo;wireless&rdquo;
problems encountered when dealing with 802.1x on Linux
are PC card configuration problems. When the
card is inserted, you should get a high-pitched beep
indicating that Card Services has loaded the right
driver. A second beep is used to communicate the
status of the card configuration, so a second lower
beep is fine because the configuration of the card
hasn't been set up yet.
</p><p>
If the card is recognized and the right driver
is loaded, try firing up a wireless network with
no encryption and no authentication. Configure
association to the network with iwconfig, and bring up
the card with ifconfig. The MADwifi driver creates
interfaces that begin with the prefix ath, so my
interface is ath0. Depending on the driver you use,
your interface may be different. When the card first
comes up, you can see it scan for the
network as the frequency reported by iwconfig changes.
When the card successfully associates to a network,
it reports the access point MAC address as well as
the operating frequency. At that point, you should
be able to ask the network for an IP address, using
whatever tool is favored by your Linux distribution:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# iwconfig ath0 essid "clearnet"
# ifconfig ath0 up
# iwconfig ath0
ath0  IEEE 802.11g  ESSID:"etherclear"
      Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.412 GHz  Access Point: 00:0B:0E:2F:0A:40
      Bit Rate:12 Mb/s   Tx-Power:50 dBm   Sensitivity=0/3
      Retry:off   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
      Power Management:off
      Link Quality=39/94  Signal level=-56 dBm  Noise level=-95 dBm
      Rx invalid nwid:107  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0
      Tx excessive retries:22  Invalid misc:22   Missed beacon:0
# dhcpcd -d -t 10 ath0
dhcpcd: MAC address = 00:20:a6:4c:ca:4b
dhcpcd: your IP address = 172.16.199.84
</pre>
</p><p>
If you can associate to a network, your card is
functional. Although it is not necessary to find out
if you can obtain an IP address from an unencrypted
network, it is helpful to know that the frame handling
and network stacks are working and that DHCP service
is configured correctly on the network. With the
wireless network system having basic functionality,
we can move on to providing security for it.

xsupplicant</h2></div></div><p>
Two major supplicants exist for Linux: xsupplicant, also known as Open1X,
and wpa_supplicant.
This article discusses only the former. Before
getting to work on xsupplicant, check the version
of OpenSSL on your system. xsupplicant requires
OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later to provide transport layer
security (TLS) support. All the commonly used 802.1x
authentication protocols require TLS, either for
authentication directly with digital certificates
(EAP-TLS) or as a protective tunnel for some other
form of authentication (TTLS or PEAP). You need a
development version of the packages to get
the expected headers.
</p><p>
Download the source code from SourceForge (see Resources)
At the time of this writing, the current
release is 1.2pre1:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ tar -xzf Xsupplicant-1.2pre1.tar.gz
$ cd xsupplicant
$ ./configure --with-madwifi-path=~/madwifi
. . .
Adding MADWIFI WPA support.
. . .
$ make

# make install
</pre>
</p><p>
As a result of the build, three executables are installed. The only
one you are likely to use is /usr/local/sbin/xsupplicant.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6d108"></a>
Certificate Wrestling</h2></div></div><p>
Secured EAP authentication generally depends on
digital certificates. Certificate data is encoded
using either the privacy-enhanced mail (PEM) format or
the distinguished encoding rules (DER). My experience
is that xsupplicant likes its certificates in PEM
format, but many certificate authorities hand
out certificates in the DER format. Fortunately,
OpenSSL is quite good at converting between formats:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# openssl x509 -inform DER -outform PEM \
-in MyCA.der -out MyCa.pem

</pre>
</p><p>
To see the actual data encoded within the certificate, you can use the
openssl command to print textual output:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# openssl x509 -in MyCA.pem -text
</pre>
</p><p>
How exactly you obtain the certificate is up to your network
administrator. Many certificate authorities make the root certificate
available on a Web page.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6d370"></a>
Configuring xsupplicant</h2></div></div><p>
When run, xsupplicant searches for its configuration file in /etc. The
config file, /etc/xsupplicant.conf, is not installed by default,
but it's easy enough to copy over:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cp xsupplicant.conf /etc/xsupplicant.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
Specify the user identity, possibly the password
and the root CA certificate in the configuration
file. Each network can have its own configuration
by bracketing the entire network configuration.
A simple configuration for a network that uses PEAP
with MSCHAP-V2 for inner authentication might look
something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dynamic-wep
{
  allow_types=all
  identity = testuser
  eap_peap {
      root_cert = /usr/local/etc/myCA.der
      random_file = /path/to/random/source
      allow_types = eap_mschapv2
      eap-mschapv2 {
        username = testuser
        password = "testpw"
      }
  }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Linux has two random number devices, /dev/random
and /dev/urandom. Both pull random numbers from a
system entropy pool, but the former device returns
only strong random numbers. As a result,
I highly recommend using /dev/random as the random
number device file. Many 802.1x implementations can
cope with relatively large delays while waiting for
a response. At the Interop Labs in Las Vegas in
May 2005, we authenticated a user account through
a multi-hop global distributed RADIUS system, so
end-to-end latency was much higher than on most
networks.
</p><p>
For testing purposes, certificate validation can be disabled by setting
the root_cert location to NONE. Although useful for testing purposes,
disabling certificate authentication removes the protections provided
by the certificate and should not be done for normal deployments.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6d630"></a>
Running xsupplicant</h2></div></div><p>
Once xsupplicant is configured, you finally can
authenticate to the network. Start by connecting to
the network that you want to attach to with iwconfig
and bringing up the interface. I have found that it
helps to give xsupplicant a dummy WEP key so it knows
that it will be connecting to an encrypted
network as well. Three commands do the trick:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# iwconfig ath0 key 12345678901234567890123456
# iwconfig essid "batnet"
# ifconfig ath0 up
</pre>
</p><p>
The wireless interface name is driver-dependent.
My interface is ath0, but yours may not be.
</p><p>
In the current version of xsupplicant, it is mandatory to
supply an interface with the -i option. When
testing, I generally find it helpful to log debug
messages with -d and keep the process in the
foreground with -f. To see a full list of what can
be printed, use --help:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# xsupplicant -w -dasic -i ath0 -f
</pre>
</p><p>
Debug messages print out each frame that is
sent and received, as well as provide processing
information with each sent or received frame. At the
end of the process, the key information is processed.
For example, a dynamic WEP key looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Processing EAPoL-Key!
[INT] Key Descriptor   = 1
[INT] Key Length       = 13
[INT] Replay Counter   = 41 2F BB 2D 00 00 00 D6
[INT] Key IV           = 66 15 69 E2 B2 8C 0E 89 7C D3 94 8C 93 25 43 1B
[INT] Key Index (RAW)  = 80
[INT] Key Signature    = 49 C1 15 B8 E9 D0 87 53 A6 FD 5D 76 CB 51 9D 65
[INT] EAPoL Key Processed: unicast [1] 13 bytes.
[INT] Using peer key!
[INT] Successfully set WEP key [1]
[INT] Successfully set the WEP transmit key [1]
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d74580.0x1e6d948"></a>
Configuring and Using WPA</h2></div></div><p>
WPA is triggered by a command-line option and is configured by two
options in the global section of the configuration file. WPA allows
you to specify the type of encryption used for unicast (pairwise)
and broadcast or multicast (group) frames. Both options can be set
in the configuration file and can take values of wep40, wep104, tkip,
ccmp or wrap. At this point, however, only the RC4-based ciphers&mdash;WEP
and TKIP&mdash;work reliably. Set up the two lines of configuration like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wpa_pairwise_cipher = tkip
wpa_group_cipher = tkip

network-config
{
  . . .
}
</pre>
</p><p>
To use WPA at run time, you must have configured
support in the driver for your card as well as the
main configuration file. WPA is not simply the new
encryption routines of TKIP and it does affect the
association process and key distribution. Due to the
level of driver support required, you need to specify
a driver with the -D option, and you must use a driver
that has WPA support compiled in:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# xsupplicant -dasic -i ath0 -D madwifi
