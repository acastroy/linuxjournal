Your wireless network might need a security
overhaul, but that beats the alternative.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18f1580.0x19e92f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I booted up my new Cingular wireless phone, and
the default item on the main menu is &ldquo;Media Mall&rdquo;.
How nice&mdash;they want to sell me $1.99 &ldquo;ring tones&rdquo;
enough to make that the number one item on the menu.
And even though the phone is a much better computer
than my first Linux box was, the selection of apps I
can install, and networks I can connect to, is locked
in by Cingular.
</p><p>
On the other hand, when I booted up my Linux box,
I got LILILILILILILILI...oh wait, let me fix that.
Much better. A standard Web browser, able to connect
to anybody. Able to do business with anyone's store
and connect through any ISP. No, I didn't get the
computer &ldquo;free&rdquo; with my Internet connection, but free
as in cell phones is no bargain when it means being
locked out of fun stuff.
</p><p>
Phil Salkie has a great example of why on page 48.
Can't listen to your favorite Internet radio show at
the time it's on? Or want to capture it to listen
somewhere you don't have Net access? Time-shift it!
What Phil did to make things run extra smoothly
is to turn Net radio shows into RSS feeds
that work as podcasts. You can use any one of a
growing assortment of clients to play them on your
own schedule. Before the next road trip I have to
take, I'm definitely setting up a podcast client on
a laptop for the car, and I'll use Phil's script to
snarf some radio shows to listen to.
</p><p>
Speaking of devices that let you listen on the road,
Dovid Kopel tried out the Archos PMA400. If you're
looking for a combined PDA and music player, check out
this Linux-based unit on page 74. And save yourself
some bandwidth and time snarfing all those podcasts
with the thorough compression tools overview from
Kingsley G. Morse Jr. on page 62.
</p><p>
Security-wise, today's wireless networks are where
the Internet was in the 1980s, before the 1988
Morris Worm helped create the network security scene
as we know it. We all know that people can do bad
things with all those open access points, but the bad
things aren't happening. Many of you could &ldquo;borrow&rdquo;
a departing Starbucks customer's identity to get a
free Net connection, but you're not. Thank you.
</p><p>
But it's only a matter of time before all our nice
little access points start getting clobbered by
spammers, phishers and new categories of naughty
people we don't even have cool words for yet.
So please read our two articles on wireless security
technology&mdash;John L. MacMichael's on page 56 and
Matthew Gast's on page 68. Combined with Mick Bauer's
series from earlier this year, this issue will get
you up to speed on how to make your wireless network
run smoothly.
</p><p>
Finally, is &ldquo;identity&rdquo; just a directory server that
has its own fancy conference? Instead of letting
big companies decide among themselves what to do with
your personal information, Doc Searls ventured into
the lairs of some mighty scary beasts and came back
with the beginning of a plan, from a strange source.
See page 40 if you dare.
