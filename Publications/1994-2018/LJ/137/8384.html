Painting</h4><p>
Well, it's rather an image. My daughter, Liv Helene, seven
years old, has used Tux Paint to make a picture of a
painting Tux. She has not told me what he is painting,
though. My guess is that it is a kernel image.

My niece, Addison Lotspaih, really seems to like
penguins. I think she was wondering &ldquo;where's the
Easter Penguin?&rdquo; in this picture. Future Linux guru? I
hope so.

Historic Linux Distribution</h4><p>
After trying out several different Linux
distributions, my baby Molly decides Caldera Network
Desktop version 1.0 is just right. Should I be
worried that she might become a lawyer instead of
a hacker?

&ldquo;Wrong Sed Fred&rdquo;</h4><p>
Thanks to Larry Richardson for an enlightening
overview of the sed command [July 2005]. I've been using
it for years, but did not know about its pattern
matching (//command) capabilities.

<i  >LJ</i> Cover Okay for US Government Offices</h4><p>
Anyone that thinks the May 2005 cover is &ldquo;smut&rdquo;
is a complete idiot and doesn't deserve to read your
excellent publication. I work in a Federal Government
installation, and since the woman on the cover is
clothed, I don't see any sexual harassment potential.

Another Cover Photo Fan</h4><p>
I just got the latest <i  >LJ</i> and was shocked at reading
two of the letters to the editor concerning the
May 2005 cover. I work at a software company
that displayed the issue on the magazine rack for
a full month. Not one person mentioned the cover
image. Don't listen to the backward, foolish idiots
who would have us stay in 1920.
Good job, <i  >LJ</i>. Don't stick to men and/or hardware on
the cover. Keep branching out.

Millions for iSCSI, Not One Cent for <i  >LJ</i></h4><p>
The article on ATA over Ethernet [June 2005] has got to be the
perfect example of the kind of crap that stops me
from buying the magazine again. Great eye-catching
title. Excellent introduction to a SAN alternative
(we use a Hitachi that cost several million so I like
to see what the alternatives are).
</p><p>
Halfway through the article I find out that the setup
requires a vendor-specific piece of hardware that
I'm sure not so coincidently is the advertisement
facing page 26 of the article. If you're going to
have multipage advertisements disguised as articles,
then state it up front. I buy this magazine for
Linux solutions (like iSCSI target and host on Linux)
primarily. I don't mind seeing vendor stuff, but don't
dress it up as something else. It wastes my time.

GB: the New MB?</h4><p>
In the third paragraph of the July 2005 &ldquo;diff -u&rdquo;
section, it states: &ldquo;Of course, because SquashFS
is a compressed filesystem, this really amounts to
about 8MB of actual data.&rdquo; This should probably be
8GB of data instead of 8MB.

Yay, Monarch</h4><p>
I was reading your July 2005 issue, and I saw an ad for
Monarch Computer. I wanted to drop you a note to tell
you that I have been buying from them for five years
now. My company buys all of our systems from them,
I have never heard of a company that bends
over backwards for their customers like Monarch does.
They have over-nighted me parts at no charge, along with
a number of other amazing things.

Linux Now on Tour</h4><p>
It is sad to see the ignorance and prudishness in
some of letters published in the June 2005 issue with
regards to the cover of the May 2005 issue.
</p><p>
Belly dancing has been a form of improvisational
dance from the Middle East, for both women and
men, dating back thousands of years. The dance is
not inherently sexual in nature, and while the image
on the cover does display a fair amount of belly,
it is far less than what one would see at a swimming
pool or at the beach.
</p><p>
I found the cover to be very tasteful and artistic.
The article was quite interesting and already has
proven useful in helping to spread Linux to several of
my friends who are about to start touring with their
(non-belly dancing) shows. Lastly, it was very nice
to see a cover that explodes the male-computer-geek
stereotype so effectively. My wife even picked up
my copy just to read the cover article. Keep up the
good work.

Bad Advertiser, Bad, Bad</h4><p>
I would like to register my protest against the
publishing of the advertisement that appeared on page
7 of the July 2005 issue.
</p><p>
I'm not a member of any identifiable minority&mdash;obese, ethnic,
physically or mentally handicapped&mdash;but I strongly disapprove of the use of photos such
as the one in the advertisement. I hope that I don't
need to explain why.
</p><p>
For several years I have been a regular buyer of <i  >Linux Journal</i> and a proud owner of two of Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s
books. Any remote idea of ever buying a Carinet
server has now been banished from my mind, forever.
</p><p>
May I suggest that you publish some sort of apology
in the next issue?

Everyone's Favorite Magazine</h4><p>
I wanted to send you a picture for your next issue. We
get <i  >LJ</i> sent to our office every month, and between the
developers and sysadmins it is a race to crack into
the magazine first; however, we all lost this time.
The newest addition to our development team got to
it first. Keep up the good work <i  >LJ</i>.

Tux over My Hammy</h4><p>
I have been an avid <i  >LJ</i> reader for a couple of years
now and always look forward to receiving my monthly
dose of Linux news updates from you all. Here
is a picture of a 72 processor Linux cluster install
at Florida International University. On a funny
note, I won the stuffed Tux out of one of those prize
machines during a 4 AM run to Denny's on the last
day of the install.

Reply to July &ldquo;Vendor Troubles&rdquo; Letter</h4><p>
Monarch apologizes for the inconvenience to the valued
customer [Letters, July 2005]. We take pride in taking
care of our customers. Upon receiving his contact
info, we contacted him immediately and are pleased to
say he has been taken care of to his satisfaction.
</p><p>
We checked our Web/voice-mail logs and found no trace
of receiving a message related to this customer's
problem, which is why there was not an immediate
response to the customer's inquiry. Monarch handles
over 250k customers a year, more than 700 per day,
and has the highest rating for customer service based
on volume at <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com" target="_self">www.resellerratings.com</a>;
unfortunately,
this one got through the cracks. We thank <i  >Linux Journal</i> for bringing this to our attention.

GIMP and nvu on Ubuntu</h4><p>

Multimedia Lock-in?</h4><p>
It appears that law-related issues are starting
to crack down on the Linux multimedia scene.
According to the MPlayer site, &ldquo;Multimedia is a
patent minefield.&rdquo; I would like to know where we (the
Linux people) stand with the patent rights and all the
other hub-a-baloo with DVDs and the like. I think the
Linux community would embrace such a writeup.
What direction do we see the &ldquo;Multimedia scene&rdquo;
going for Linux? Are we going to be out cold?

You can create your own media in patent-free formats
you can use on any OS. See xiph.org for details.
In the USA, the infamous Digital Millennium Copyright
Act lets the non-Linux OS vendors lock in their
customers with multimedia formats. Join eff.org to
support legal reform to let people legally switch OSes
without losing access to content they bought.  &mdash;Ed.
