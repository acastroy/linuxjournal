<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #137, September 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

The <span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span> phenomenon continues. Self-hosting
and fast as lightning at three days old, git and
its favored set of wrapper scripts <span   class="bold"><b>Cogito</b></span> have
continued to improve and have already had a huge
impact on kernel development. Projects left and
right are migrating from BitKeeper to git. <span   class="bold"><b>Net
driver</b></span>
development and <span   class="bold"><b>libata</b></span> development have
switched. <span   class="bold"><b>JFS</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>NTFS</b></span> have switched. And the
<span   class="bold"><b>stable</b></span> w.x.y.z kernel
tree, maintained by <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>Chris
Wright</b></span>, has also converted recently to git. Some
kernel hackers find git to be such an improvement over
BitKeeper that they are able to produce much more work
than they had before, to the point that <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span>
is having to rethink the way he handles patches in
order to accommodate them. BitKeeper documentation
has been removed from the kernel sources, and mailing
lists such as bk-commits-head that originally
were intended to receive announcements of new BitKeeper
changesets, receive git kernel patch notices instead.
</p><p>
However, git is not for everyone. When asked, <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> said
he did not intend to use git for his -mm kernel tree, because his set
of patching scripts are still sufficient for his needs. Also, <span   class="bold"><b>Matt
Mackall</b></span> has been working on his own fast-as-lightning version-control
system, <span   class="bold"><b>Mercurial</b></span>. This is also an excellent tool and shows itself
to be the equal of git in a number of ways, especially speed. In fact,
as Linus has pointed out, the two are actually quite similar in their
underlying behaviors. Clearly, both of these tools represent an entirely
new look at version control, and projects like arch that had previously
been in the lead are finding themselves struggling to catch up.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Markus Klotzbuecher</b></span> has produced an interesting new virtual filesystem
called <span   class="bold"><b>mini_fo</b></span> (fanout overlay). It allows users to write to files on
read-only filesystems, by creating a writable area elsewhere and layering
the user's changes from that area on top of the read-only data. To the user,
the effect is transparent. What had been read-only, now appears writable,
although in fact the read-only data is never actually modified. The mini_fo
tool is intended to allow software upgrades on embedded systems, but other
uses have already been found and more undoubtedly will appear.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Bartlomiej Zolnierkiewicz</b></span>, two big-time <span   class="bold"><b>IDE</b></span> developers, are
having trouble pooling their efforts. While Bartlomiej is the current IDE
maintainer, Alan did much of the initial work to convert the old IDE code
into a maintainable state from the unutterable corpse-strewn nightmare it
had been for years. Although Alan has been somewhat out of the Linux picture
lately, he returned to check on the progress of IDE and didn't like some of
the changes Bartlomiej had made. There does seem to be some bad blood
between them, as there seems to be between any developers who have at one
time or another worked on IDE. Bartlomiej invited Alan to fork the code
and do things differently if he pleased.
</p><p>
It's sad that IDE is still able to inspire enmity
among developers. For this we should blame the
IDE disk industry itself, which has so warped and
destroyed any possible standard, creating exception
upon exception upon exception, compounding all of
it with trade secrets and proprietary documentation,
that anyone would have to be insane even to attempt
to maintain the IDE kernel code. That folks like
Bartlomiej and Alan, and those that came before them,
like <span   class="bold"><b>Mark Lord</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Andre Hedrick</b></span>, have done
so is a tribute to their generous natures. Without
the IDE code, most of us would not find Linux nearly
as useful.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Benjamin LaHaise</b></span> recently tried to simplify
and make more maintainable the implementation
of <span   class="bold"><b>semaphore locking</b></span> across kernel
architectures. The current code is complex and
difficult to read, with many architecture-specific
details. These nuances have grown with
the number of supported architectures, and the
natural inclination is to create a generic semaphore
system that compiles and works on all architectures
uniformly. However, semaphores run deep, and the
need for blinding speed in that code is difficult
to compromise on. Given that any slowdown would
have a noticeable impact on kernel performance,
it's likely that any attempt at code unification
will meet strong resistance by the maintainers of the
various architectures. This is in fact how Benjamin's
work was received. And so, while some improvements
certainly may be made, it seems unlikely that the
semaphore code will ever become truly generic and
simple. Speed is just too strong an incentive.

<h2 class="title">A Report from the Linux Audio Conference 2005</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Dave Phillips</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #137, September 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

Linux audio developers and musicians came together
for the third annual Linux Audio Conference, held
April 21&ndash;24 at the Zentrum fur Kunst und
Medientechnologie (ZKM, the Center for Art and Media
Technology) in Karlsruhe, Germany. This event included
topic presentations on sound and music software, such
as hard-disk recording, sound synthesis languages,
music composition, softsynths, MIDI technologies
and audio-optimized Linux distributions, along with
two concerts and two more music programs.
The entire conference was broadcast and recorded in
audio and video formats.
</p><p>
Ivica Bukvic stressed the need for a coordinating
effort to ally developers with
manufacturers, vendors and possible sponsors more closely,
while Christoph Eckert focused on the need for
greater concern for usability issues. The conference also included an update from Maarije Baalman
regarding her WONDER software and a report from Georg
Bonn on free software for music composition.
</p><p>
A presentation on FireWire as an audio interface
created quite a stir among developers, particularly
since no manufacturer has yet disclosed driver code
for any available FireWire audio interface. Track
2 covered software, including the MusE audio/MIDI
sequencer, the ZynAddSubFX synthesizer and the Ardour
digital audio workstation.
</p><p>
Linux sound and music applications have become a
real choice for musicians and sound researchers,
and the music at both concerts put the issue to
rest. Participants and guests also enjoyed Linux
Sound Night, during which developers of Linux
music performance software got to show us what
their programs could do. The Sound Night shaded
imperceptibly into Linux Chill Night, ending an
exhilarating day with more music, dancing, drinks
and conversation.
</p><p>
Standout presentations included the FireWire and
Ardour demos already mentioned, as well as Julian
Claasen's presentation on his text-based studio.
The Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora audio and video streams
were set up and managed by conference stalwart Joern
Nettingsmeier and newcomer Erik Rzewnicki. The A/V
streams were themselves a demonstration of the power
of free and open-source software. I am happy to
announce that LAC2006 will be held again at ZKM.

<h2 class="title">GUADEC 2005</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Robert Love</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #137, September 2005</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

GNOME users and developers alike descended on
Stuttgart, home of Porsche in southern Germany, for
the sixth annual GUADEC&mdash;the GNOME User and Developer
European Conference&mdash;to discuss the future of GNOME
development, hear about business and government
migration to Linux desktops, marvel at the latest cool
applications and cunning hacks, and witness Nokia's
awesome announcement of its GNOME-powered 770
Internet Tablet and developer's program.
</p><p>
Keynote speakers at the May 29&ndash;31, 2005 conference included
Miguel de Icaza, GNOME founder and Vice President
at Novell; Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical founder
and one-time cosmonaut; and Nathan Wilson, Software
Lead at DreamWorks Animation Studios. Miguel gave,
as usual, a rousing talk on the future of GNOME,
Mono and Linux as a whole, and Nathan discussed
DreamWorks' transition to a GNOME-based Linux
desktop. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Madagascar</em></span>, DreamWorks' next animated feature
film, was made with GNOME!
</p><p>
Quality speakers abounded too, including Owen
Taylor, Gtk maintainer; Keith Packard, X supreme
commander; and Jon Trowbridge, Beagle maintainer. Anna
Dirks and Pete Goodall, both of Novell, presented
results from their in-depth Windows Migration Study.
Glynn Foster of Sun gave a moving introduction to the
GNOME Project. They even let me speak, against better
judgment, on optimal GNOME programming techniques.
</p><p>
The most valuable part of the conference, however, was the informal
hallway chatter and the widely attended hackfests, where GNOME hackers
could meet (many for the first time), debate hot topics and then sit
down and hack out elegant solutions.
</p><p>
GUADEC veterans such as Nat Friedman remarked that &ldquo;this may be the
best GUADEC ever.&rdquo; While I was without reference&mdash;this was my first,
but hopefully not my last GUADEC&mdash;it was certainly time well spent,
in a beautiful city with some smart folks.

Matthew Gast, author of this month's article on xsupplicant, spent part
of his summer co-teaching a class in Australia with Chris Hessing, lead
developer of the xsupplicant Project. Lucky for us, the
<i  >LJ</i> Web site got an &ldquo;Interview with Chris Hessing,
Lead Developer of xsupplicant&rdquo; article out of the deal (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8388" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8388</a>). Read what Chris had
to say about developing one of the two major 802.1x client packages for
Linux, including some of the challenges of developing on Linux, keeping
up with the relevant standards and why it is difficult to build
WPA(2)/802.11i support for Linux.
</p></li><li><p>
In an upcoming article, Michael George will be covering &ldquo;Building a Call Center with
LTSP and KPhone&rdquo;, including some of the problems he ran into when
installing and configuring KPhone, such as a configuration option
that doesn't seem to change anything and icons not
being found. Because of these factors &ldquo;Building
kphone was a bit more complicated&rdquo;, and our Editor in Chief asked Michael
to follow up with the KPhone developers by submitting a bug report. In
his <i  >LJ</i> Web site article &ldquo;Filing a KPhone Bug
Report&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8389" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/8389</a>),
Michael updates us on what, if any, progress has been made.

The lack of any concrete numbers at all shows the
typical academic hand-wavy &ldquo;our asymptotic is good,
we don't need to worry about reality&rdquo; approach. Good
asymptotics are one thing, but constant multipliers
can be killer, and it's necessary to work out
constant multipliers for all potentially problematic
constants, not just the easy ones like CPU.
