Worse than a fallen souffl&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;is a wireless card with
no Linux driver. Save the dinner for your guests with a few handy utilities.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1967580.0x1a5f3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Yes, Fran&ccedil;ois. The access point by the fireplace is much better
for you to connect to. The ESSID? It's cmfireplace. You'll
see it in the list if you scan for it. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi? Mon
Dieu</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois, you aren't actually editing a script, are you?
Although I admire your desire to get comfortable with the shell, it would
be much easier for you to select the scan for the access point, select,
click and go.
</p><p>
Ah, I see! The Linux driver for your card doesn't support scanning. Yes,
I had a similar problem with mine, but I have a solution. I'll show
you in a little while, but time is short and our guests will be here
any moment. To the wine cellar, Fran&ccedil;ois. Head to the South wing of the cellar and bring
back the 1983 Batard Montrachet. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span>
</p><p>
Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, home of exceptional Linux fare, fine wines and wonderful
guests, of course. Before you
arrived, my faithful waiter and I were discussing some problems we have
experienced with our wireless cards. My own notebook's wireless
card worked fine on my home network, but it worked only so well. The standard
Linux Orinoco driver that supported the card didn't allow for things
such as scanning. Every month, I went down to the TV studio to record a
show, and every month I had to ask which wireless router I could use,
because I had to enter the information manually into the network
configuration file, ifcfg-eth2. </p><p>
Of course, the Windows driver for the wireless network card supported
these features, and as sometimes happens, manufacturers aren't 100%
forthcoming with information or specifications to make full Linux support
easy. I truly admire the incredible talent and energy of Linux developers
who provide Linux with excellent drivers while working in a vendor black
hole. Nevertheless, this lack of information was the impetus for the
NdisWrapper Project, which makes it possible to use Windows Ndis drivers
by way of a loadable Linux kernel module.
</p><p>
Here's how it works. First, you'll need to get a copy of NdisWrapper from
the project's Web site (see the on-line Resources) to guarantee you use the latest version. That said, if you have a recent
Linux distribution, check your CDs first. You may find you already have
the software. Second, you need the Windows drivers that came with your
card, specifically the INF file for that card.
</p><p>
Here's an example from my own Presario notebook, which came with a
built-in LanExpress card. Under Linux, connectivity was supported by
the Orinoco driver, but as I mentioned, scanning did not work. Because
I never actually installed Windows on my notebook&mdash;it was there,
but I put in a Linux CD before I ever booted the unit, so I never had
Windows working on it&mdash;I went to the HP Web site and downloaded the
driver file in a self-extracting EXE file. I used CrossOver Office
to extract the package and then navigated to the folder where the package
was located. Using NdisWrapper, I installed the driver by way of its INF
file; this must be done as the root user:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ndiswrapper -i NetWlan.INF
Installing netwlan
</pre>
</p><p>
Looking at the output above, it doesn't look like a lot has happened. By
using the -l option, we can find out what drivers have been
loaded and the status of those drivers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ndiswrapper -l
Installed ndis drivers:
netwlan driver present, hardware present
</pre>
</p><p>
The next step is to load the driver into the running kernel, which is
done by loading NdisWrapper itself:

<pre     class="programlisting">
modprobe ndiswrapper
</pre>
</p><p>
The net result of this can be seen
by looking at the output of the dmesg command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ndiswrapper version 1.2rc1 loaded (preempt=no,smp=no)
ndiswrapper: driver netwlan (LAN-Express,01/18/2002,1.07.29.20118) loaded
ACPI: PCI interrupt 0000:00:09.0[A] -&gt; GSI 10 (level, low) -&gt; IRQ 10
ndiswrapper: using irq 10
wlan0: ndiswrapper ethernet device 00:02:8a:a9:e6:eb using driver netwlan,
configuration file 1260:3873.5.conf
ndiswrapper (set_auth_mode:584): setting auth mode failed (C0010015)
wlan0: encryption modes supported: WEP
</pre>
</p><p>
Excellent, we now have the Windows driver loaded into our Linux system
and are ready to go. To have all this happen magically at boot time,
I added the steps, minus the dmesg, to my rc.local file.
</p><p>
Now, you could get a list of wireless access points near you by using the
<tt  >iwlist</tt> command with the scan option. Assuming a wireless
interface at eth2, the command would be <tt  >iwlist eth2
scan</tt>. I then could use the iwconfig command to attach to my network
of choice, assign an IP address and so on. However, it also would be
nice for the whole desktop experience to have a graphical alternative,
one that could scan for networks, report on the quality of the signal
and then offer a means of connecting to the service you choose. The notebook,
after all, also is a desktop tool.
</p><p>
One of the best such tools I've found is Pawel Nawrocki's Wireless
Assistant. This is a great-looking little program that lets you scan
for available wireless networks and then connect to them with a single
click. Each identified network is identified by factors such as link
quality and encryption. The application can be configured to handle WEP
keys automatically, ignore various types of networks (ad hoc or encrypted),
automatically run a script upon connection and more. Figure 1 shows
the application in action.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8355f1.large.jpg"><img src="8355f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Wireless Assistant is a tool to scan for and attach to wireless
networks.
</p></div></div><p>
The Wireless Assistant Web site (see Resources) has source code available
as well as binary packages for several distributions. By the way, I must
mention right now that the SourceForge site has only code available. If
you want to track discussions on the package, the KDE-Apps.org (see
Resources) site is the better place to look for that information. Building
the application from source is a classic extract-and-build five-step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xjvf wlassistant-0.3.9.tar.bz2
cd wlassistant-0.3.9
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
The actual program name is wlassistant. When the package first
starts, it automatically checks for your active network device. If it
doesn't, click the Detect button. If you still are having problems, it is
possible that the path to the wireless tools hasn't been set properly.
Click the Configure button and a configuration dialog appears.
In the left-hand sidebar, categories of options are listed while the
actual changes take place in the larger right-hand window. Click the
Paths button to confirm the pathnames to the wireless tools commands
(Figure 2). You can either enter them manually or click the Detect button.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8355f2.large.jpg"><img src="8355f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Use Wireless Assistant's configuration dialog to set the pathnames
to the wireless tools.
</p></div></div><p>
While you are in the configuration dialog, take some time to examine the
other options at your disposal. When you are happy with the settings,
click OK to return to the main Wireless Assistant window. If you haven't
already done so, click Rescan to locate your available access points
(Figure 1). As you can see from the image, a handful of networks are
available for me to choose from. The display also shows whether
an access point uses WEP encryption; this is always a good idea unless
you actually want to provide open access to whomever comes your way.
</p><p>
Click the entry of your choice and a box appears so you can enter
the root password (Figure 3). Your connection now is established. That's
all there is to it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8355f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Before switching your network settings, you need to
provide the root password.
</p></div></div><p>
When I was visiting clients and tying into a variety of networks,
I created a little script that copied ifcfg-ethX and
network back and forth, depending on the site I was visiting
that day. It worked, but it wasn't the most elegant solution. In the
world of wireless connections, this hasn't changed. If you are moving
from access point to access point, office to office and then back home,
you're going to want some kind of help in maintaining all those different
profiles. This is true whether you are dealing with wireless or one of
those old-fashioned wired connections, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non?</em></span>
</p><p>
This is the idea behind Per Johansson's netGo (Figure 4).
netGo is a great little application that lets you create
network profiles of all kinds and then switch between them with a single
click. When not in use, the application docks into your system tray.
The program itself is a Qt application, but it works equally well with KDE or GNOME and others.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8355f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. netGo makes it easy to set up and maintain a number of
network profiles.
</p></div></div><p>
To get your copy, head to the netGo Web site (see Resources). If you choose
to build from source, this is your basic extract-and-build five-step,
so nothing too scary here. To run the application, run the command
<tt  >netgo</tt>. You are asked to provide the root password at this
point so that you can make network address changes later.
</p><p>
At first, the main window doesn't contain any profiles. To start the
process, click the Add profile button and a new window appears
(Figure 5). At the top, enter the profile name, for example, HomeLAN or
CoffeeShop, and then choose an interface card; many notebooks have a
built-in 10/100
Ethernet card in addition to the wireless card. For connections that
require a static IP address, fill in the information in each of the
fields for IP address, Netmask and so on.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8355f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Entering connection details for a netGo profile.
</p></div></div><p>
When you are done, click the OK button to save your profile. If the
connection you are setting up is wireless, click on the More options
button. There, you can enter the network mode&mdash;ad hoc, managed,
none&mdash;the ESSID and the WEP key. Notice also the Custom script field. This
provides a means of automatically executing a series of commands, such
as a custom firewall script, when bringing up the interface. Click the Back
button to return to the main configuration screen.
</p><p>
Continue adding as many profiles as you need in the same manner. To
activate a profile and apply your network settings, click on the profile
name and then click the button labeled Go! to apply the changes. A status
window then appears displaying the new settings (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="8355f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. netGo reports back on the changes that were made as the profile
executes.
</p></div></div><p>
The only real drawback I've found to netGo is it doesn't currently
provide for taking down your second interface, so this still needs to
be done manually if needed. But according to Per's Web site, this
feature is in the works as I write this column.
</p><p>
It would appear, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, that closing time has arrived, if
that clock on the wall is to be believed. Nevertheless, I'm sure that
Fran&ccedil;ois won't mind if we keep the doors open a little longer; time
enough to refill your glasses one last time. We even can bring out a
little of that double-butter Brie to accompany the wine. As we all
are running wireless tonight, perhaps everyone can carry their notebooks
outside to the patio where we can enjoy the evening before we all head
home. Please raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink
to one another's health.
