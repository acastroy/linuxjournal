Hughes in the July 1997 issue. Mr. Hughes indicated that SSC is
using Slackware 96, but is changing to the Debian distribution.
Here are a few questions:</p><p>1. Why are you considering a change to Debian?; 2.
Is there a problem with the Slackware 96 distribution?3. What are
the advantages/disadvantages of Debian?4. What are the
advantages/disadvantages of Slackware 96 and other versions?</p><p>I would also like to see articles on the following if it is
possible:</p><p>1. Comparing the RDBMS products such as Solid, Empress, mSQL,
Postgress and etc products.2. Comparing the Motif and other GUI
development tools such as Xforms.3. Many articles stressing the
important uses of Linux in the Real World &mdash;Edmund P. Morgan Senior
Software Analyst Emorgan@cup.net</p><p>While Slackware has been reliable, its upgrade management
tools are lacking. Debian (and Red Hat) offer an installation
system that includes dependencies. In addition, Debian offers a
menu choice to upgrade all installed packages. When you are
managing the software on 25 systems, good configuration management
can save you substantial amounts of time. We are planning to do an
article comparing the various distributions next year in our June
issue.</p><p>You must be reading our Editorial calendar for next year: our
focus for the February 1997 issue is databases, for March, it is
GUIs and for April, it is Business Solutions. In past issues we
have done reviews of most of the databases as well as addressing
GUI development tools; we have also covered Tcl/Tk and Xforms and
present a monthly &ldquo;Linux Means Business&rdquo; column. &mdash;Phil Hughes,

Education</h2></div></div><p>I was on your web page and saw the cover for the October
Education issue. I was a college professor when I felt my life most
had meaning, and because of that, I always enjoy working with
college students. Your cover brought that feeling home to me
again.</p><p>It looks like a good issue, and I expect to enjoy reading
it. &mdash;Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall maddog@zk3.dec.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d2f580.0x1e27558"></a>My First Issue</h2></div></div><p>Yesterday I received my first issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> in my mailbox. I have not put it down since.
This is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>best</em></span> source of information for
Linux I have found. I run a production Linux network/Internet site,
and I am always looking for information about new tools and other
Linux information. <i  >LJ</i> has already helped me
solve the problem of how to monitor my Linux servers. I've been
using Linux since 0.99.something and have completely converted from
other partial Unices. Keep up the good work. The only thing I can
see that would help <i  >LJ</i> is if it came out once
a week instead of once a month. I can dream... &mdash;Darren
Young youngd@cirrusnet.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d2f580.0x1e277c0"></a>Bridging the Generation Gap</h2></div></div><p>My parents just left with two copies of <i  >Linux Journal</i> (#38 and #39, #40 appeared in the mail
today)--in spite of the fact that up until now, they have only used
MS-DOS for their computing needs.</p><p>In Dutch we have this proverb: &ldquo;Je bent nooit te oud om te
leren&rdquo;--you're never too old to learn. So, who knows ... &mdash;Toon
Moene, The Netherlands toon@moene.indiv.nluug.nl</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d2f580.0x1e27978"></a>Choices</h2></div></div><p>After reading Mr. Temple's letter to the Editor in the August
1997 issue, I must disagree. The popularity of Linux has exploded
in the past year, not because of people who want to see how a true
preemptively-multi-tasked operating system works, but because
people want to use this operating system to accomplish tasks (i.e.,
real work).</p><p>I can find my way around a kernel; in fact, hacking the Minix
kernel was required in my Operating Systems class in college.
However, my main interest in using Linux is to do my job. To that
end, I've used Linux on a surplus 386 SX/20 to build a company
firewall/gateway and e-mail server/router. Using IP masquerading,
sendmail and a few custom Perl scripts, this throw-away machine is
now responsible for routing both incoming and outgoing e-mail and
for firewalling our Intranet over a single dynamic PPP line. To me
and to a lot of other readers of <i  >LJ</i>,
networking is the main draw to Linux. One of the beauties of Linux
is that it has something for everybody.</p><p>Keep &ldquo;Kernel Korner&rdquo;--I read it&mdash;but keep on including the
networking articles. Linux is too diverse for
<i  >LJ</i> to resemble <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC
Magazine</em></span>. &mdash;T.J. Harrell

been collecting your articles related to webmastering and running a
network/web server. This spans the gamut from creating/using CGI
scripts to how to use &ldquo;TCP Wrappers&rdquo; (August 1997). I've got
quite a selection now, and it's occurred to me that others may have
the same need.</p><p>So, may I suggest <i  >LJ</i> package reprints of
all the pertinent articles from years past, add an index and
perhaps some advertising, then sell it for a reasonable/nominal
price, perhaps $5.95US (myself knowing nothing about the
publishing, especially the money).</p><p>As an alternate, perhaps you could put up a page on your web
site with an index to the articles, with each a link to a summary
page or the actual text, if available. This might encourage people
to then buy the back issues. &mdash;Scott
Daniel sscott@blueghost.npt.nuwc.navy.mil</p><p>I'll put it on the &ldquo;wish&rdquo; list. We do put articles on the
web site after a time, but it's never certain as to when someone
will have the time to do the HTML. We are also planning to start
putting past issues on CD-ROMs and sell them in that format. The
1996 issues are in the works now.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d2f580.0x1e27ef8"></a>Lotus Notes for Linux</h2></div></div><p>Half a year ago, I'd asked on the Caldera mailing list what
kind of applications people would want on Linux that weren't yet
available. The two most-requested applications were an accounting
package and Lotus Notes. With the Appgen announcement, one of those
is now covered. As for the other...</p><p>I was in conversation recently with someone who has been
talking to IBM (at an appropriately high level) about porting Notes
to Linux. That person told me that <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span>
testimonials about potential end-users who would buy Notes for
Linux would be instrumental in convincing IBM to make it happen.
There are no technical issues; this is only a matter of marketing
and convincing the sales folk.</p><p>While I have no use for Notes, I believe its availability for
Linux would be both an important application and yet another
validation of Linux's suitability for corporate use.</p><p>Please e-mail me any relevant information and I promise to
pass it on ASAP&mdash;added to a few stories of my own... &mdash;Evan
Leibovitch, Ontario evan@telly.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d2f580.0x1e28160"></a>Really Push League</h2></div></div><p>I read Doc Searls article, &ldquo;Shoveling Push Media&rdquo;, in
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, June 1997. I threw out my TV
six years ago; if push ever comes to shove, I'll do the same with
my computer systems, too.</p><p>I've been in this business for fun and profit since the days
of CP/M, designing circuit boards, programming, etc. and on the
Internet for about a decade. &mdash;Max Southall max@prninfo.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d2f580.0x1e28318"></a>Zombie Processes</h2></div></div><p>In the August 1997 issue (just received), I have spotted what
I believe to be an error. On page 40, In the column &ldquo;Best of
Technical Support&rdquo; there is a footnote to the paragraph headed
&ldquo;Mysterious Zombie Process&rdquo; which states, &ldquo;When a parent process
dies or is ended, any child process started by the parent becomes a
zombie process.&rdquo;</p><p>The condition described is that of an orphan process, not a
zombie. Orphan processes are created when their parent process
terminates, and all orphans are automatically adopted by the
scheduler process (process 1).</p><p>A zombie process, on the other hand, is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> process that has terminated but not yet
been cleaned out of the process table. In some of the original Unix
literature from the folks at Bell Labs, they comment that a zombie
process can only be resurrected by the use of arcane magic.</p><p>In the voodoo religion, a zombie is a dead person who has
been reanimated via magic, so the appellation when applied to a
Unix (or Linux) process is not quite appropriate, but it comes
close.</p><p>As to the problem experienced by Scott (the author of the
note), I would venture to guess that the process he is invoking
(<span   class="bold"><b>netcfg</b></span>) performs a fork( ), exec(
) combination, and the parent process then exits. This is a typical
hack used to prevent the invocation of a program from hanging up
the terminal if the user forgets to use the &amp; character to run
it in the background.</p><p>Since the parent has terminated, the terminal is again
available for command input. The child process will still be
running in the background, however. For whatever reason, the parent
process is not able to be cleaned out of the process table (perhaps
until the child processes all terminate?), and so it shows up as a
zombie. &mdash;Harry Gross harry.gross@ix.netcom.com</p><p>The footnote in question is almost a direct quote from
&ldquo;Unix: An Open Systems Dictionary&rdquo;, William H. Holt and Rockie J.
Morgan, Resolution Business Press, 1994. This dictionary also
defines an orphan process as being synonymous to a zombie process.
I wanted something short for the footnote, and the Dictionary gave
me that sentence&mdash;perhaps, I need to buy an updated version.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d2f580.0x1e286e0"></a>U.S. Domain</h2></div></div><p>In regard to the article, "Registering in the U.S. Domain
(For Free)'', by R. K. Owen, July 1997, the title is very
misleading. The era of free US domain registration is over. Most of
the incorporated cities of the US domain have been delegated to
entities which usually charge a yearly fee for registration and
maintenance.</p><p>The assignment of delegation was done by Jon Postel and done
without any public notification or bidding on administrating. That
is, there is no indication of why an administrator acquired the
domain, but whoever they are, they have no reason to not charge any
amount they wish.</p><p>Those domains not covered by incorporated cities, which are
still administered by ISI direct will shortly be farmed out as
well, as Postal claims ISI (Information Sciences Institute, USC) is
shutting down such services.</p><p>Even worse, previously delegated domains down to one's own
personal name are transferred, and those now holding such domains
may be liable for the fee or lose their database references. &mdash;John
