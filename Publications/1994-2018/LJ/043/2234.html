Where to, Why to. It's all available in repetitious detail. Only a
few aspects of the Web aren't overdone. Server administration is a
big one (a WWW book catalog is another). A good book with
background and information on the various choices of server
software would be a boon. Such a book is <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Unix Web
Server Book</em></span> by R. Douglas Matthews, Paul Jones, Jonathan
Magid, Donald A. Ball and Michael J. Hammel. It is well-written and
informative, fills a gap in available books, and its authors bear
impeccable credentials.</p><p>Setting up a web server is not a difficult task (given a
stable Internet site), but it is one that requires a unique set of
tools. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Unix Web Server Book</em></span> was written to
allow someone with little or no experience with the Web to set up a
server. This is perhaps something of an anomaly, since anyone
capable of administering a Unix system is likely to have enough
basic knowledge to configure a web server using software
documentation. Still, there is a necessary background that this
book attempts to fill.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Unix Web Server Book</em></span> assumes no
prior knowledge of the World Wide Web and so begins with a brief
history. Chapter two, &ldquo;The Basic Pieces&rdquo;, is summed up by the
chapter legend &ldquo;What is this http:// stuff?&rdquo;. Chapter three
compares servers and recommends Apache, a freeware server available
for many platforms. An introduction to web security follows. In the
next ten chapters, introductions are given to the elements of
developing web pages, including HTML, importing documents, images,
multimedia, searching, forms, advanced CGI, Java and HTML checkers.
Finally, &ldquo;Fitting in: Joining the Virtual Community&rdquo; finishes up
the book. It's all at a pretty basic level, but the sum is a hefty
book with voluminous references to on-line resources.</p><p>Included with the book is a CD-ROM containing many of the
tools and programs necessary to get a web server up and running,
including the Red Hat Linux distribution, Apache web server, HTML
utilities, graphics programs, CGI packages and more, all arranged
by chapter of discussion. The collection makes an excellent
beginning to a web site (&ldquo;beginning&rdquo; since no true webhead is
ever content).</p><p>When I received a copy of the book, I was hopeful of an easy
installation of the latest version of Red Hat Linux. Unfortunately,
the version included is not supported by either Red Hat Inc. or the
publisher of this book. Moreover, the CD-ROM directory structure is
incorrect; although the distribution is complete, the install
program expects a specific directory structure that is not adhered
to on the CD-ROM. It is possible to copy the files onto a hard disk
(about 300MB total) and install. However, a better option is to
splurge and buy the latest version of a Linux distribution. This
has the added benefit that many of the CD-ROMs available contain
software useful for web sites.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The Unix Web Server Book</em></span> is a solid
guide for someone new to the Web who is charged with developing not
only a web site, but also a web server. More advanced readers may
find the book too basic and may often be frustrated at the
tantalizing hints of deeper truths. Fortunately, the book is a gold
mine of annotations to web resources for everything covered&mdash;right
back to Vannevar Bush's ground- breaking 1945 article &ldquo;As We May
Think&rdquo; on the electronic linking of documents. Future server
administrators may find this book useful depending on their network
experience. More likely, they'll gain more from a book that is
dedicated to whatever task is at hand. Finally, one group who will
find this book of interest is the experienced web surfers looking
to understand how the Web works, but who aren't actually going to
set up a server. And don't overlook that CD-ROM&mdash;if you don't have
fast access to the Internet, having all the basic web software at
your fingertips is very nice indeed.</p></div></div>
