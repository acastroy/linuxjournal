    Promoting Linux in the workplace...
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd3a580.0xe322f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>During the summer of 1997, employees of
the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) put on a one-month expo to
showcase Linux. This article describes how and why we did it.
</p><p>The Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) is one of Switzerland's
three largest banks, with offices world-wide and 30,000 employees.
Currently, UBS has 25,000 PCs running mainly Windows 3.11, 800-900
Novell NetWare servers (3.11 or 4.11), around 800 applications
servers, around 1,000 workstations running Solaris and at least
3,000 printers.</p><p>I work in the system development section (SYBS&mdash;System and
Basic Services) where we mainly use workstations and servers
running Solaris 2.5.1. We produce our own &ldquo;repackaged&rdquo; Solaris
release, named OpenLAN, which is used on the production Unix
servers. The OpenLAN release includes Perl, tcl/tk, et al.&mdash;the
normal set of Unix tools in a package format. Notice the world
&ldquo;package&rdquo; above. All software is delivered in a Solaris (Sys V)
package for easy installation and removal.</p><p><a href="0230f1.jpg" target="_self">Figure 1</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd3a580.0xe32558"></a>Why Linux?</h2></div></div><p>Quite a few of the employees have a PC at home and for those
working with or on the Unix side, it is (or would be) quite natural
to install Linux at home. Linux provides an ideal environment for
learning more about Unix in general, system administration and Unix
tools. Also, a Linux system is neither resource hungry nor
expensive to set up. Today it is possible to buy a shrink-wrapped
installation on a CD-ROM, and you do not need to be technical
expert to install Linux on your machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd3a580.0xe32660"></a>Preface</h2></div></div><p>In the building where our section is located, there is an
area which is used for one-month expositions about different
subjects. The subjects range from information about different parts
of UBS, security policies or employees' personal interests:
astronomy, model plane flying, etc. The available area is
approximately four by four meters with two panels for
posters.</p><p>Last summer, Alois Camenzind thought that a small Linux expo
would be a good idea. This would enable us to spread information
about Linux and its uses&mdash;let others know that Linux is a &ldquo;real&rdquo;
Unix system. After getting the &ldquo;Okay&rdquo;, Camenzind contacted
employees within the section who had expressed both knowledge and
interest in Linux. We formed an unofficial workgroup to prepare the
Expo. The main work was producing posters with information about
Linux and Linus Torvalds, getting resources (machines), setting up
the machines and contacting interested companies for information
and products.</p><p><a href="0230f2.jpg" target="_self">Figure 2</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd3a580.0xe32870"></a>The Linux Expo</h2></div></div><p>We ended up with two Intel 486 Compaq boxes which were set up
running Linux kernel version 2.0.12 (the latest stable release at
that time). We used the Red Hat Rembrandt Beta II distribution
provided to us by Red Hat. A SPARCstation 5, running kernel version
2.0.16 with the SPARC Red Hat distribution, was also on display to
show multiple platform support.</p><p>We set up an Apache 1.1.1 WWW server running on of one of the
Compaq machines. This WWW server had a preloaded cache with HTML
pages from the SSC web site, http://sunsite.unc.edu/, the Swiss
Linux User Group and other interesting Linux-related web sites.
Since we were behind a firewall, we opted to load the cache on an
Apache proxy server to make information generally available during
the Expo.</p><p><a href="0230f3.jpg" target="_self">Figure 3</a></p><p>The same machine also served as an NFS server for the smaller
Compaq on which we stored the binaries and sources. The NFS server
made it possible for interested people within UBS to obtain more
information via HTTP or to mount the exported file system via NFS
to get up-to-date kernel sources.</p><p>X11 was running on all machines, as well as a subset of the
application packages provided in the distribution as an example of
what kinds of software are included in a typical Linux
distribution. To show an example of a commercial application
running under Linux, we installed a demonstration copy of
Applixware. We configured the machine to start Netscape whenever a
user logged in, displaying our WWW server home page with pointers
to the cached pages and other collected material. This was our
invitation to the user to start browsing and discover more
information about Linux.</p><p><a href="0230f4.jpg" target="_self">Figure 4</a></p><p>Behind the machines (see photographs) were the panels with
posters about Linux (all in German): &ldquo;What is Linux?&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Information sources for Linux&rdquo;, &ldquo;The GNU General Public License
(GPL)&rdquo;, &ldquo;Linux Development History&rdquo;, &ldquo;Linux Time Line&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Who is Linus Torvalds&rdquo;. We also made information provided by SSC
and Red Hat available beside the machines.</p><p>During display, anyone could just walk up to one of them and
log in. Then (s)he could playing with the system, start X
applications or just browse the local web via Netscape. We also
provided a mirror of the latest release of the kernel as well as a
Linux distribution which the user could copy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd3a580.0xe32c90"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>The machines and materials were on display without anyone
from the workgroup watching or being there, other than during lunch
time or coffee breaks. The whole idea was to have a display which
invited people to sit down and explore the Linux systems.</p><p>Walking by the area at different times during the day (or for
some of us&mdash;nights or evenings), there were always people playing
with the Linux machines. Taking into account that most of the
material (SCC flyers, etc.) put on display had to be renewed every
week, we felt people were quite interested in what Linux had to
offer.</p><p>Most of our time was spent getting the information about
Linux and its history from the Net, preparing the demonstration
machines, making the presentation panels and setting up the WWW
cache. Once everything was in place, we only had to update the
mirror material and occasionally reboot the machines to insure
proper operation.</p><p><a href="0230s1.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
