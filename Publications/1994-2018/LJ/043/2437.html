contains the source code (kernel versions up to 2.0), and CD 2
contains the installation files. A quick scroll through the book
gives the impression that a lot of time was spent to put it
together. It has a nice overall layout (including the cover), and
catchwords are printed in the left or right margin. My first
impression of the book was good; I was ready to discover what the
text would bring me.</p><p>The book contains nine chapters and a reference section. It
begins with a brief history of Linux that is not so deep as to
become boring for a new Linux user. Chapter 2 consists of 2 pages
and gives a summary of the most important features of the Linux
distribution included on the CD-ROM: X Window System Version 6, GNU
utilities and programs, a complete Unix development environment and
many other tools. One important thing to mention is the smart
CD-ROM cache&mdash;more on this later. A 1-page chapter follows to
explain the new features in Linux 2.0. Chapter 4 explains to the
reader which hardware is required to run Linux and includes a long
list of supported hardware&mdash;from SCSI adapters and sound cards to
PCMCIA adapters. The ATI Mach 64 video adapter is supported, but I
still had problems with it and with the Slackware release.</p><p>Prior to the installation chapter, there is a chapter which
explains the various methods of installation: a fixed installation
or an installation using the smart file cache. The smart file cache
method keeps the software on the CD until it is invoked for the
first time, then the file cache copies it to your hard disk. On the
next invocation, the program starts directly from hard disk. As a
result, your hard disk will only be filled with software that you
actually use. The same chapter explains how to partition your hard
disk.</p><p>In chapter 6 the installation procedure is presented. The
reader is guided through the installation via very clear pictures
of the graphical user interface (GUI). Additional boot options are
explained in Chapter 7 of the book. During my installation of the
distribution, I had problems with the configuration of my ATI Mach
64 video card; to solve this I made use of the Metro-X software
already in my possession. I think it would be nice for the next
release to include Metro-X, particularly since it is usually
included in the Slackware distribution anyway.</p><p>The next 2 chapters describe the fundamentals of Linux and
system administration. In the fundamentals chapter, the reader
learns how to mount a CD, change directory, change permissions for
file/directory, copy, move and remove, print and many other
techniques. If the reader has a problem, he can invoke the on-line
documentation, which is included on the CD as well. It is not
necessary to read the whole chapter to get to a specific topic, you
can just jump to the desired paragraph.</p><p>The administration chapter defines administration and
explains the powerful <span   class="bold"><b>xadmin</b></span>
program. The book makes use of this program for all administration
jobs. Also in this chapter, the configuration of X11 is
explained&mdash;from a detailed description of the XF86Config file to
the configuration of the window manager (FVWM) file.</p><p>The reference section is the last part of the book. This
section explains a lot of Unix commands with their associated
options clearly and concisely.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Universe</em></span> offers a useful start for
the newcomer to the Linux world. The text is clear and very
readable; the examples are good and well explained with figures.
The GUI (graphical user interface) makes it very easy to install
this distribution, and the xadmin program brings a lot of benefits.
All of the installation documentation and the publications of the
Linux Documentation Project are present. For me, the best of all is
the ability to install Linux via the cache mechanism.</p></div></div>
