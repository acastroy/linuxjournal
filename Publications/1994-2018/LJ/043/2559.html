dispute over ownership of the Linux operating system trademark has
just been resolved. As a result of litigation brought by a group of
five Linux companies and individuals against William R. Della
Croce, Jr. of Boston, Massachusetts, Della Croce has assigned
ownership for the registered mark to Linux Torvalds, the original
author of Linux, as part of the a settlement agreement.</p><p>The plaintiffs in the suit were Linus Torvalds; Specialized
Systems Systems Consultants, Inc. (<i  >Linux Journal</i>) of Seattle; Yggdrasil computing, Inc. in San
Jose; Linux International, Amherst, NH; and Work Group Solutions of
Aurora, CO. Non-plaintiffs Red Hat Software, Inc., Metro Link Inc.
and Digital Equipment Corporation supported the litigation and
contributed to the cost of the litigation.</p><p>The five plaintiffs brought suit against Della Croce in the
U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeals Board, in November 1996. Della
Croce had obtained registration of the Linux mark in September
1995, which created a storm of protests by the Linux community, who
felt the mark belonged to Torvalds or the Linux community and not
to any individual. In an attempt to correct the situation, the
plaintiffs retained the internationally known intellectual property
law firm of Davis &amp; Schroeder of Monterey, California, who
handled the case on a greatly reduced fee bases, as a service to
the Linux community.</p><p>The five plaintiffs, through their attorneys, announced today
that (1) the matter has been settled by the assignment of the mark
to Linus Torvalds, on behalf of all Petitioners and Linux users,
and the dismissal with prejudice of the pending PTO Cancellation
Proceeding; and (2) that Respondent was reimbursed for his
trademark filing fees and costs by Petitioners. The other terms of
the Settlement Agreement are confidential.</p><p>All inquiries should be referred to Petitioners' law firm,
Davis &amp; Schroeder at 408-649-1122 or by email at
ggd@iplawyers.com. A copy of the original Cancellation Petition
filed in the TTAB, can be found at
