an understanding of the basics of Linux using the Slackware v3.1
distribution. It is directed to the newcomer, the same market as
Matt Welsh's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Installation and Getting
Started</em></span> and O'Reilly's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux in a
Nutshell</em></span>. I think the fact that so many books directed
toward the Linux user seem to be appearing on bookshelves these
days is a sure sign that publishers are recognizing the growing
market to be found for Linux.</p><p>The book describes author Steve Heath in this way:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&ldquo;The author has been involved in the design and
development of microprocessor-based systems since 1982. He is the
author of 15 books in the computing field.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>As described, Mr. Heath is certainly well qualified to write
a Linux book for the novice. The book is well written and clear,
although like most books it could have benefitted from one more
proofreading pass. I found it a bit annoying that the word
megabytes is abbreviated as Mbytes instead of MB, but certainly not
confusing. In the trade name declarations, Mr. Heath prematurely
announces Linux as a trademark of Linus Torvalds. (Certainly a
statement we hope is true by the time this review is
printed.)</p><p>Chapters are arranged nicely, starting with the introductory
material (installation, booting, etc.) and going on to discuss
commands, shell scripts and editors. Finally, there are short
chapters on system administration, networking and installing
XFree86.</p><p>The installation chapter is comprehensive and accurate,
working its way from setting up the keymap and disc partitions,
through software installation and configuration, to building and
testing the kernel. There are also discussions of LILO, kernel
patches and the /proc file system. All of this is good information
that is necessary in order to get up and running with Linux.</p><p>The basic Linux commands are also covered well. Mr. Heath
uses a standard format to present the information, which includes
the command definition, the arguments and an example. While he is
quite explicit about the dangers of using the remove command
(<b  >rm</b>) carelessly, he neglects to offer the usual
advice to the novice of setting up an alias for
<b  >rm</b> containing the <b  >-i</b> option,
so that the user is always queried for confirmation before removing
a file.</p><p>The bash and tcsh shell chapters are adequate and full of
examples to aid the novice in writing scripts of his own. No
mention is made of the korn shell, which some of us still do
use.</p><p>Editors are given short shrift. Mr. Heath concentrates on the
ed and ex line editors, giving 5 of some 20 pages to vi and
ignoring Emacs entirely.</p><p>The chapters on system administration and networking are also
short given their subject matter, but they do give a good
introduction to the basics for both&mdash;and this is all the title has
promised.</p><p>The final chapter is entitled &ldquo;If It Doesn't Work&rdquo; and
gives some solutions to a couple of common problems and some tips
for debugging shells. At less than five pages, it is the shortest
chapter in the book. I guess not much goes wrong with Linux.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Essential Linux</em></span> comes with a CD-ROM that
contains Slackware v3.1, documentation from Sunsite and various
versions of the Linux kernel from 1.3.2 through 2.0.06 and 2.1
(development).</p><p>In conclusion, if you are a Linux beginner who has chosen
Slackware as your distribution, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Essential
Linux</em></span> is one of many books that can help you get
started. It amply fulfills its promise of presenting the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>essentials</em></span>.</p></div></div>
