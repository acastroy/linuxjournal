    This month we learn additional ways to retrieve data from a
    relational database and ways to divide our data into
    multiple tables for maximum efficiency.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17db580.0x18d33f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In the last installment, we looked at
ways to use a relational database server from within CGI programs.
Relational databases are a great help, since they provide us with a
relatively simple means of storing and retrieving information.
</p><p>Everything in a relational database is stored in
two-dimensional tables, with each row representing a record and
each column a field within that record. When we use ASCII text
files to store our information, we generally have to write our own
routines for saving and retrieving that information; by structuring
our information in tables, we can save ourselves quite a bit of
time and energy, as well as ensure that our data will not be
corrupted when multiple instances of our program attempt to modify
the information.</p><p>Communication with a relational database is carried out using
the Structured Query Language (SQL). Because SQL is not a
programming language, we have to embed our SQL queries inside of a
C or Perl program if we want to execute them.</p><p>Last month, we looked at a set of CGI programs which allowed
visitors to our web site to send and receive web-based postcards.
Users entered information about themselves and their postcards'
recipients, along with the name of a graphic and a short text
message. Each postcard was stored in the postcards table, with each
row in the table representing a single postcard. By giving each row
a unique ID number, our program was able to retrieve individual
postcards from the database.</p><p>Indeed, the program send-postcard.pl that we examined last
month demonstrated how it is possible to take inputs from an HTML
form and turn them into a postcard stored in our database, as well
as how to take that unique ID number and use it to display a
postcard with show-postcard.pl. The unique ID number is generated
by send-postcard.pl when it creates a new row in the postcards
table and ensures that users can retrieve their own postcards while
making it relatively difficult to find those addressed to other
people.</p><p>The programs we are examining are written in a portable
enough version of SQL that they should run on just about any
relational database server. However, I have only tested these
programs using MySQL, a nice, small relational database product for
several versions of Unix, including Linux. You can find out more
about MySQL on the Web at http://www.tcx.se/.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17db580.0x18d36b8"></a>Replacing Names With Numbers</h2></div></div><p>One of the problems with that version of send-postcard.pl was
that it asked the user to name a graphic file to be inserted into
the postcard she was sending. While this sounds like a nice idea,
there were several problems with it, most notably the fact that the
user could name a file that did not exist on the server. Moreover,
there was no way for the user to know which graphics did exist on
the server, short of writing another program that would present a
directory listing.</p><p>Additionally, storing the file names for the graphics
alongside the other postcard information is inefficient and can
lead to synchronization problems. After all, what happens if you
decide to change the name of a file from foo.gif to bar.gif? Under
our current model, we would have to go through the entire
&ldquo;postcards&rdquo; table and rename each row in which foo.gif appeared.
This is not terribly difficult to do, but it means we have to think
carefully before making such a change.</p><p>Finally, storing the names of the graphics files introduces
the possibility of typographical errors. A user might inadvertently
type fooo.gif, and thus prevent the postcard's recipient from
seeing the desired graphic.</p><p>In order to solve all of these problems, we will move the
names of the graphics files to a separate table, giving each
graphic a unique ID number, much as we did for each postcard. With
this system in place, we can then refer to graphics by number in
the postcards table. We can still refer to an infinite number of
graphics in this way, but we do so by using an integer, rather than
a string, saving storage space on our file system. In addition,
such consolidation allows us to change one or more of the graphics
file name(s) or location(s) without having to worry about ruining
our program's output.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17db580.0x18d38c8"></a>Creating our Graphics Table</h2></div></div><p>We can retrieve one or more rows from a table in our database
using the SQL <span   class="bold"><b>SELECT</b></span> command,
which returns all of the rows matching our selection criteria.
Thus, if we are interested in retrieving the row with the ID number
of 12345 from the postcards table, we can do so by sending the
query:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
select * from postcards where id_number = 12345
</pre><p>This will return a small table, the rows of which all have an
id_number equal to &ldquo;12345&rdquo;. Since id_number is guaranteed to be
unique, we can expect that the table returned by the SELECT command
will consist of a single row and all of the columns contained in
the postcards table. If id_number was not guaranteed to be unique,
then SELECT might well return a number of rows from the table,
rather than only one.
</p><p>We can wrap SQL queries inside of programs, and CGI programs
are full-fledged programs; thus, we can easily write a CGI program
that:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>takes an argument from a user,</p></li><li><p>uses that argument in the SELECT statement sent to
the database server, and</p></li><li><p>gives us a new SELECT statement each time we run
the program.</p></li></ol></div><p>Let's create a new table, in which the first column uniquely
identifies the graphic, and the second column names the graphic. I
do this using the interactive
<span   class="bold"><b>mysql</b></span> program that comes with
MySQL, which I enter by typing
<b  >mysql&lt;\!s&gt;test</b>. To create the new table,
enter the following lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
create table graphics (
        graphic_id mediumint not null primary key,
        graphic_file varchar(60) not null)
</pre><p>The interactive mysql program indicates that the command was
executed successfully by giving us the following message:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.13 sec)
</pre>


We have now created a table with two columns. The first,
graphic_id, stores medium-sized integers, cannot be null and must
be unique (&ldquo;primary key&rdquo; in SQL lingo). The second column stores
a variable-length string containing up to 60 characters and must be
non-null.
</p><p>We can now insert a graphic into the graphics table with the
following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO graphics (graphic_id,graphic_file)
        VALUES (12345, foo.gif);
</pre><p>Now if we ask for the contents of the graphics table, we get
the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; select * from graphics;
1 rows in set (0.04 sec)
+------------+--------------+
| graphic_id | graphic_file |
+------------+--------------+
|      12345 | foo.gif      |
+------------+--------------+
</pre>


We have now proven it is possible to store a record of a particular
graphics files, as well as to retrieve the name of that file based
on a unique ID number. Now comes the hard part&mdash;making an
association between the ID and the graphics file name.
</p><p>First of all, we need to modify the definition of our
postcards table, such that it now expects to get the ID number of a
graphic, rather than the graphics file name. To create the
postcards table, use the following SQL command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
create table postcards (
        id_number mediumint not null primary key,
        sender_name varchar(60) not null,
        sender_email varchar(50) not null,
        recipient_name varchar(60) not null,
        recipient_email varchar(50) not null,
        graphic_id mediumint null,
        postcard_text blob);
</pre><p>Notice that we have removed the graphic_name column from the
table we defined last month and replaced it with a column named
graphic_id&mdash;which has the same name, size and type in both of the
tables. We don't need to give the columns identical names, but
doing so makes it easier for us to keep track of things.
</p><p>The most straightforward way to replace the old graphic_name
column with the new graphic_id column is to create the table anew,
as demonstrated with the above SQL command. However, this action
results in the loss of any data already in our table. In the
beginning of a project that uses a database, creating and
destroying tables is quite normal&mdash;at least until you get the
definition right. After a table has been used for a while, you
probably don't wish to destroy your data.</p><p>To solve this problem, we simply add our new column
(graphic_id) to the postcards table using the
<span   class="bold"><b>alter table</b></span> command, which allows
us to add one or more columns to an existing table. This is not the
most efficient way to design a database, but it eliminates worry
about programs which might be dependent on graphic_name.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17db580.0x18d4318"></a>Joining two tables</h2></div></div><p>Our database now contains two tables: &ldquo;postcards&rdquo;, with all
of the information required to assemble a complete postcard
(including the ID number of the graphic we wish to display), and
&ldquo;graphics&rdquo;, which maps those ID numbers to the names.</p><p>How do we create an association between the two? We already
know that it is possible to use SQL's SELECT command to retrieve
one or more columns from a table. SELECT can also be used to
retrieve columns from multiple tables and can even join columns
together from them.</p><p>For instance, let's get the sender name, recipient address
and graphic name from our two tables, such that the graphic name
for each postcard is displayed immediately next to the unique ID
and recipient address.</p><p>First, let's add another graphic file to the graphics table,
just for good measure:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; INSERT INTO graphics (
        graphic_id,graphic_file)
        VALUES (67890, bar.gif);
Query OK, 1 rows affected (0.00 sec)
mysql&gt; select * from graphics;
2 rows in set (0.16 sec)
+------------+--------------+
| graphic_id | graphic_file |
+------------+--------------+
|      12345 | foo.gif      |
|      67890 | bar.gif      |
+------------+--------------+
</pre><p>Let's now create a postcard to use for our example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
insert into postcards (id_number, sender_name,
        sender_email, recipient_name,
        recipient_email, postcard_text, graphic_id)
VALUES (99999, "Bill Clinton",
        "president@whitehouse.gov",
        "Al Gore",
        "vice.president@whitehouse.gov",
        "Please call. I have a new tax idea.",
        12345)
</pre>


Notice that because they are integers, neither the postcard ID
number nor the graphic ID number is surrounded by quotation marks.
Also, notice how the initial list of columns in our INSERT command
includes graphic_id, but leaves out graphic_text. Since
graphic_text in postcards can contain null values, we can ignore it
when inserting new rows into the table.
</p><p>Now let's retrieve the sender name, recipient name and
graphic file name for the postcard we just created:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; select postcards.sender_name,
        postcards.recipient_name,graphics.graphic_file
        -&gt; from postcards,graphics
        -&gt; where postcards.id_number = 99999;
        2 rows in set (0.31 sec)
+--------------+----------------+--------------+
| sender_name  | recipient_name | graphic_file |
+--------------+----------------+--------------+
| Bill Clinton | Al Gore        | foo.gif      |
| Bill Clinton | Al Gore        | bar.gif      |
+--------------+----------------+--------------+
</pre><p>Egad&mdash;this isn't what we wanted at all. We wanted it to bring
up the file name for the ID we specified, not the combination of
all rows and columns in the &ldquo;graphics&rdquo; table with our postcard.
That's what we wanted to do, but that's not what we told the
computer to do. By formulating our SQL query as above, we
inadvertently asked for all possible combinations of rows from
postcards with rows from graphics, this combination is known in
database circles as the &ldquo;Cartesian product&rdquo; of the two. While
asking for a Cartesian product is not an error, it is almost always
undesirable. When dealing with especially large tables, asking for
such a combination of tables can result in a long, unnecessary
computation that ties up the database server keeping it from
performing other tasks.
</p><p>How can we modify our database query so that it does what we
originally wanted, namely, giving us the graphics file name in
place of its ID number in the postcards table? The simplest way is
to set up a restriction between the two tables, adding to the WHERE
clause in the query, as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; select postcards.sender_name,
        postcards.recipient_name,graphics.graphic_file
        -&gt; from postcards,graphics
        -&gt; where postcards.id_number = 99999
        -&gt; and postcards.graphic_id =
                graphics.graphic_id;
        1 rows in set (0.10 sec)
+--------------+----------------+--------------+
| sender_name  | recipient_name | graphic_file |
+--------------+----------------+--------------+
| Bill Clinton | Al Gore        | foo.gif      |
+--------------+----------------+--------------+
</pre><p>Now that's more like it. By requiring the equivalence between
the graphic_id columns in both tables, we retrieved the information
as if it came from a single table. That's part of the magic of SQL
and relational databases. By combining tables in this way, you can
make your data easier to handle by putting it in separate tables.
However, when you retrieve the information, no one knows it came
from separate tables, since a new, temporary table is returned to
the caller.
</p><p>This may seem like a silly example, but imagine a corporation
with very strict pay scales whose payroll is handled by a
relational database. If you give every employee an ID number
indicating salary, you can give everyone a raise (or a reduction,
depending on the company's financial state) by updating records in
a salary table, rather than the table of employees. The next time
you perform a <span   class="bold"><b>join</b></span> between the
employee and salary tables, the new salary will be reflected
automatically.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17db580.0x18d48f0"></a>Turning the SQL into Perl</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have seen how to get our queries to work at the
SQL level, let's think about the necessary steps needed to
integrate these queries into some CGI programs. For the most part,
our CGI programs do not need many changes. We need to modify
send-postcard.pl so that it inserts the graphic ID into the
postcards table, rather than the graphics file name, and
show-postcard.pl needs to use the SQL query that we formulated
above in order to get the graphic file name from the graphics table
in addition to the information in the postcards table. The revised
versions of the code are not completely reprinted this month. These
two listings along with the listing that is printed are available
by anonymous download in the file
<a href="../listings/043/2508.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue43/2508.tgz</a>.</p><p>First, we'll look at the revised version of show-postcard.pl.
The only change to be made to the listing printed last month is in
the SQL query, which now reflects the new table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $command = "";
$command = "select postcards.sender_name,";
$command .= "postcards.sender_email,";
$command .= "postcards.recipient_name,";
$command .= "graphics.graphic_file,";
$command .= "postcards.postcard_text from ";
$command .= "postcards,graphics ";
$command .= "where id_number = $id";
$command .= "and postcards.graphic_id = ";
$command .= "graphics.graphic_id";
</pre><p>Only this one change is necessary, because of the way in
which we wrote the original version of show-postcard.pl. By
contrast, imagine how much code we would have needed to rewrite if
we had initially stored the information in a single ASCII text
file, and then split the information between two files.
</p><p>Our modifications to send-postcard.pl is almost as easy. We
need to add the definition of $graphic_id, rather than
$graphic_name, at the top of the file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
my $graphic_id = $query-&gt;param("graphic_id");
</pre><p>When we insert the postcard into the postcards table, we must
modify the code so it uses the graphic_id column and variable,
rather than graphic_name:
<pre     class="programlisting">
$command = "insert into postcards ";
$command .= " (id_number, sender_name, ";
$command .= " (sender_email, recipient_name, ";
$command .= " recipient_email, graphic_id, ";
$command .= " postcard_text) ";
$command .= "values ";
$command .= " ($id_number, \"$sender_name\", ";
$command .= " \"$sender_email\", ";
$command .= " \"$recipient_name\", ";
$command .= " \"$recipient_email\", ";
$command .= " \"$graphic_id\", ";
$command .= " \"$postcard_text\") ";
</pre>


With those modifications in place, we are done. Now our code will
work just fine with the new table, storing and retrieving graphics
according to their ID.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17db580.0x18d4cb8"></a>Creating the form</h2></div></div><p>There is one remaining problem with this version of the code.
How is a visitor to our site supposed to know or remember the ID
numbers for the various graphics that are available? We could
modify the HTML form to provide this information, but it seems a
bit silly for us to do so, since we would then have to update the
form each time we updated the table.</p><p>The simplest solution is to write a small CGI program that
produces the HTML form, inserting the values as appropriate. There
are a number of different ways to allow the user to choose, but I
decided when writing this program to take a relatively easy path by
using radio buttons. A more aesthetically minded programmer (or one
who expected to have a lot of graphics files) may have chosen a
selection list, but that's a side issue. The resulting program,
postcard-form.pl, is shown in <a href="2508l1.html" target="_self">Listing
1</a>.</p><p>That about does it for our postcard-sending problem. There
are, of course, many other ways in which this set of programs could
be extended or modified. For example, it might be a good idea to
create a CGI program that would allow us to enter and edit the file
names in the graphics table, so that we would not have to use the
interactive mysql program for such modifications. Currently, only
someone knowledgeable in SQL can add, modify and delete elements in
the graphics table. We could also ensure that the ID numbers in the
graphics table are given sequentially; some relational database
vendors provide that facility, allowing for &ldquo;identity&rdquo; columns
that automatically increment as new rows are added.</p><p>It would also be nice to allow users to preview the graphics
they place on the postcards, or at least describe the pictures
rather than just presenting the users with file names. This option
might require storing two versions of each graphic or adding
another column to the graphics table that would be used for
descriptions or previews.</p><p>The possibilities, as you can tell, are unlimited&mdash;and this
is a relatively small project.</p><p>This article ends our whirlwind tour of SQL, although future
columns will undoubtedly continue to use relational databases as a
means for storing information. Next month, though, we will look at
the efficiency of our CGI programs, including the &ldquo;CGI lite&rdquo;
module for Perl.</p><p><a href="2508s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
