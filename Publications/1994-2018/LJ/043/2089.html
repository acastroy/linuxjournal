    Would you
    like to publish the texts you write in more than one format&mdash;PostScript
    for printing, plain ASCII for e-mail, and HTML for the a web page?
    YODL could be just the language you need.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25c5580.0x26bd450"></a></h2></div></div><p>I wrote the first version of YODL in late
1995 and early 1996, as a general document language for my personal
use then named DOM, for &ldquo;document maintainer&rdquo;. I was dissatisfied
with the SGML converter I was using at the time, and wanted to
write a quick-and-dirty program that would read a document and
convert it either to LaTeX (for printing PostScript) or to HTML.
</p><p>Unfortunately, a quick-and-dirty program, like a boomerang,
has a way of flying back at you. As soon as I began to use YODL, I
told my colleagues at work about it, and they were immediately
ready to use it too. Soon I was rewriting YODL, implementing new
features, writing converters for other formats and documenting it
all. YODL has evolved from a private program to the document
language everyone in my department uses. I consider YODL ready for
the world in its current &ldquo;beta&rdquo; state. In this article I'd like
to introduce YODL and tell you why it is a handy program to have
around.</p><p><a href="2089s1.html" target="_self">Obtaining and Installing
YODL</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25c5580.0x26bd660"></a>Design Specifications of YODL</h2></div></div><p>First, let me explain my goals in designing YODL. Most
importantly, I wanted YODL to become a document language that would
be intuitive and easy to use, unlike many common document languages
such as LaTeX, HTML and some current SGML implementations.</p><p>In each of these languages, certain characters are special.
In LaTeX, for example, you can't simply enter
<b  >$%\*</b> and expect it to appear in your text. In
HTML you must enter <b  >&lt;</b> as
<b  >&lt;</b> to produce the &lt; character. In my
version of SGML you must enter an ampersand
(<b  >&amp;</b>) as either <b  >&amp;</b> or as
<b  >&amp;ero;</b>, depending on whether you want the
ampersand to appear in normal text or in a listing&mdash;which is
horrible. On the other hand, all characters in YODL appear in the
output as you entered. My idea is this: just type away, and
whatever you type goes into the output. YODL implements
translations such as these with <span   class="emphasis"><em>character conversion
tables</em></span>. For example, the LaTeX conversion table
specifies that a <b  >*</b> in the input results in a
<b  >$*$</b> in the output. (You could even create a
character conversion table stating that aa should lead to bb, bb to
cc, and so on; which might produce interesting output.)</p><p>&ldquo;Whatever you type goes to the output&rdquo; is, of course,
relative. Each document language must provide a way to put commands
in the text to do things such as change the font, start a new
chapter, etc. Typing commands in LaTeX, HTML or SGML is, in my
opinion, awkward. For example, typesetting text in boldface
requires that you enter <b  >{\bf text}</b>,
<b  >&lt;strong&gt;text&lt;/strong&gt;</b> or
<b  >&lt;bf&gt;text&lt;/bf&gt;</b>. I don't know about
you, but my fingers always get stuck when typing the curly braces,
backslashes and smaller-than or greater-than characters. If you
program on a regular basis, you will probably agree that typing
parentheses is easier. Therefore, I chose to define a command in
the YODL language as a macro name, followed by arguments in
parentheses, as in <b  >bf(ext)</b>. This syntax looks
like a C-style function with an argument list, except that macros
having more than one argument will have each argument within
separate parentheses. Another advantage of parentheses is that many
editors have a &ldquo;match-mode&rdquo; that highlights pairs of these
characters making the typing of text much easier.</p><p>As for the &ldquo;usefulness&rdquo; of a document language, however
arbitrarily measured, I find that such a language must support at
least automatic numbering of sections, labels in the text and
references to them, and it must create a table of contents. Respect
where respect is due: these features (and lots more) are
implemented in LaTeX. I, therefore, chose to let YODL &ldquo;emulate&rdquo;
this feature in other output formats. When YODL converts a document
to HTML, it creates a clickable table of contents and numbers its
sections.</p><p>By design, the YODL package consists of one generic program
that is able to process simple commands&mdash;this is the
<b  >yodl</b> program. This program is not a real
converter by a long shot but just a first phase. The bare
<b  >yodl</b> program knows about commands such as
<b  >INCLUDEFILE</b> (to read in a file),
<b  >DEFINEMACRO</b> (to define a new macro),
<b  >IFDEF</b> (for conditional execution), etc. A real
converter uses <b  >yodl</b> for its first phase but
supplies macro files and character conversion tables for a given
format. For example, <b  >yodl2tex</b> which converts a
YODL document to LaTeX, loads an appropriate macro file specifying
that <b  >bf(text)</b> is in LaTeX <b  >{\bf
text}</b> and that a <b  >$</b> character must be
typeset as <b  >$\dollar$</b>. Some converters, like the
HTML converter, require a post-processor for specific actions,
e.g., to resolve labels and references and to create a clickable
table of contents. Normally, the user is not aware of such
peculiarities: simple shell scripts (such as,
<b  >yodl2html</b>, <b  >yodl2tex</b>,
<b  >yodl2txt</b>) run the <b  >yodl</b>
program, supply the right macro files and, if necessary, start post
processors.</p><p>The last design consideration I want to mention is that
situations can arise in which you
<span   class="bold"><b>must</b></span> use commands in a given
output language (LaTeX, HTML or whatever) to accomplish special
goals. Although YODL can be used without knowledge of the output
format, the final document language is by no means hidden. The
macro package implements the commands
<b  >latexcommand(cmd)</b>,
<b  >htmlcommand(cmd)</b> etc., which are hidden. The
macro package implements only the commands active for their output
format. This means that all the nifty features of YODL can be used
for the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; things, while you can always fall back on the
specific commands of the final output language for special
features.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25c5580.0x26be3c8"></a>Using YODL</h2></div></div><p>The macro package that comes with YODL defines four main
types of documents: articles, reports, books and man pages. A YODL
source file must always mention what type of document is being
processed. The difference between the document types is that
different top-sectioning commands are defined for each (e.g., an
article has no chapters, a report has no parts and a man page has
its own specific sections) and how the HTML converter splits the
resulting HTML file into different sub-files. The HTML output is
split by chapters, which are reached via a clickable table of
contents and by &ldquo;next chapter&rdquo; links. The statement that defines
the document type also sets the document title, the author and the
date. (If you're familiar with LaTeX then all this probably rings a
huge bell. Yes, I'm guilty of &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; wherever I can.)</p><p>Before stating the document type, several optional commands
can be specified to alter the appearance of the document. Examples
are <b  >mailto</b>, a macro that sets the default e-mail
address for HTML output, or <b  >htmlbodyopt</b>, a macro
that is used to define the foreground or background colors. A
sample document could therefore be started as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
htmlbodyopt(fgcolor)(#0000B7)
mailto(karel@icce.rug.nl)
report(XWatch: Watcher of logfiles
        under an X session)
        (Karel Kubat)
        (1996)
</pre><p>These statements would be followed by the document. Reports
are divided into chapters, chapters into sections, sections into
subsections, etc. When labels are used following the sectioning
commands, references can be made to those labels. In HTML the
references are clickable links:
<pre     class="programlisting">
chapter(Introduction)
This is the introductory chapter. Specific
information about the installation is in
chapter ref(install).
chapter(Installation) label(install)
This chapter describes the installation in
detail.
</pre>


As an example of user-defined macros, consider the following. Let's
say that you want to typeset 1/4 either as shown here, or as a
fraction with the 1 above the 4. The layout of this fraction will
depend on the output format, with only LaTeX supporting the latter
notation. The way to accomplish this would be to define a new
macro, say <b  >quart</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
DEFINEMACRO(quart)(0)(\
  latexcommand(\frac{1}{4})\
  txtcommand(1/4)\
  htmlcommand(1/4)\
  mancommand(1/4))
</pre>


This statement defines a macro called <b  >quart</b>
having zero arguments. Macros can have up to thirty-five arguments.
The macro expands to a command in each output format, LaTeX, HTML,
man or plain ASCII&mdash;one per conversion. Now, the new command can be
used as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
a quart is quart() gallon
</pre>


Also, note that the backslash character can be used to split long
lines into readable source code, as in shell script programming.
It's just one more feature that I considered handy and, therefore,
implemented.
</p><p>The YODL language has tons of other useful macros&mdash;there's
not space for a complete enumeration. However, here's a couple just
for the fun of it. You can use footnotes in a document by
specifying:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
footnote(
</pre><p>Depending on the output format, the text is either a real
footnote or it is placed in the running text. Similarly, the macro:
<pre     class="programlisting">
url(
</pre>


puts a clickable URL in a HTML document or mentions the description
and location in other types of output. And there's lots more,
including the way YODL handles accent characters. All can be found
by reading the documentation that comes with the YODL archive.

and I've released it to whoever wants it. One of the great things
about the Linux community is that it is a pool of millions of
beta-testers. I expect YODL to continue to evolve over the next few
months.</p><p>In any case, what YODL still needs is a flawless converter to
plain ASCII via the <b  >groff</b> route. I wrote two
converters: one that interfaces to the <b  >man</b>
format and one that interfaces to the <b  >ms</b> format.
That's at least a good start; though the <b  >man</b> and
<b  >ms</b> packages can do more than just what I've
picked out. Furthermore, the HTML converter only supports
&ldquo;standard&rdquo; HTML, no nifty features such as frames, although there
is some rudimentary table support. And, of course, converters to
other formats would be welcome, like a converter to the
<b  >texinfo</b> format for the creation of info files,
etc.</p><p>All in all, YODL has already proven itself in our department,
where almost all documents that accompany our software are now
written in the YODL language. I hope you won't find YODL worthwhile
looking at, or I'll be swamped emptying my mailbox for the next few
months and improving the YODL package. All kidding aside, I hope
this article has tickled your curiosity enough, that you'll try out
YODL and discover its usefulness.</p></div></div>
