addition to the Lifebook line of notebook computers. It is neither
fancy nor overly innovative in its design (interior or exterior),
but so far it appears to be a solid, stable machine, difficult to
beat at its price point. Perhaps more importantly, the Lifebook
makes a good, inexpensive Linux laptop machine, with a couple of
comments.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c0d580.0x1d05a28"></a>A Compact, Not a Sports Car</h2></div></div><p>The Lifebook reminds me strongly of my first new car, a
Pontiac Sunbird. It has a solid feel to it, with keys, latches and
components that click appropriately when used. Its outward styling
is not very fancy, looking pretty much like most of the other
models in its class. For its size, it's a little heavy, at 7.3
pounds. It's not capable of going extremely fast, sporting a
Pentium 120 as its CPU, non-MMX processor. It has adequate headroom
and leg room, but not lots of it, at 16MB of RAM, expandable to 72
(The model is actually advertised as having only 8MB of RAM, but
current models are shipping with a &ldquo;free upgrade&rdquo; to 16. My guess
is that Fujitsu realized at the last minute that supplying mere 8MB
was simply not adequate.) and a 1.08GB hard drive. It does not get
superb mileage, having a nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) battery of
only two hours duration, although there is an advertised option for
a lithium-ion battery.</p><p>On the other hand, for a relatively low sticker price, it
comes equipped with many of the things people have come to expect
in a personal computer today. Fujitsu preloads Windows 95 (fear
not, dear reader, I'll fix that problem shortly), Microsoft Works,
Intuit's Quicken PE and CyberMedia's FirstAid suite. In a moment of
lucidity, Fujitsu decided to include both the Windows 95 and the
bundled software on CD, so there's no need to make backup floppies
just to have a pristine copy of the bundle. There's a floppy drive
and a 10x CD-ROM, although as shipped they share a single
multi-function bay; an optional cable allows you to hook up the
floppy drive externally.</p><p>Fujitsu gave the Lifebook the usual array of ports: serial,
parallel, SVGA, an IrDA-compliant infrared transceiver, a
port-replicator dock, headphones out, microphone in and two PCMCIA
slots in the typical two-of-Type-II-one-of-Type-III configuration.
The screen is a 11.3 &ldquo; Dual Scan&rdquo; that is fairly readable.
Directly underneath the screen is a status panel, with indicators
for power, suspend-state, charging state and disk access. The
&ldquo;suspend&rdquo; button is right next to this panel, large enough to be
obvious, but out of the way enough to be impossible to hit by
accident. This means that you can not put the machine to sleep or
wake it up unintentionally&mdash;a definite plus.</p><p>The keyboard has about 80 keys, including almost all the
typical PC-keyboard keys and the more recent Start and Menu keys.
Finally, it sports two speakers (one on each side of the status
panel, right beneath the screen's hinges), a condenser-microphone
hidden on the left side near the front of the unit, and
SoundBlaster-compatible audio hardware.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c0d580.0x1d05c38"></a>Great. What about Linux?</h2></div></div><p>The most difficult part of getting Red Hat Linux 4.1 up and
running on the Lifebook 420D was getting it physically installed.
But as an experienced user, even that wasn't a big problem. Quite
honestly I made it a little harder on myself than it had to be by
making some of the specific choices I did.</p><p>For one thing, I wanted to keep a &ldquo;minority&rdquo; Windows 95
partition, primarily for playing games. I bought the machine
primarily as a writing utensil (Emacs may well be as bloated as MS
Word, but at least it's free and doesn't crash), but I do like my
diversions. Most of the games I'm interested in aren't even out for
the Macintosh, let alone Linux.</p><p>For another thing, I acquired neither a modem nor the
optional external floppy adapter. In the first case, I decided
against it because my wife and I already own a modem (although I
didn't acquire a serial cable at first, either), and I wanted to
wait out the modem speed wars before buying another. In the second
place, I decided that I simply would not require both the CD-ROM
and the floppy drive at the same time all that often, if at all,
which so far has proven correct.</p><p>The result was that, to accomplish all my goals, I had to
rely on the ability to swap the CD-ROM and floppy drive while the
machine is suspended. First, I cleaned out all the bits of bundled
software I was fairly sure I would never, ever use, which included
MS Works, Internet Explorer and a number of other odds and ends. I
then copied Red Hat's FIPS utility from the CD to the hard drive,
suspended the machine and swapped the CD-ROM out for the floppy
drive. I woke the machine up, built a simple DOS boot floppy and
copied FIPS over to it.</p><p>Before rebooting, I ran the bundled disk defragmenter to make
sure everything was well &ldquo;packed down&rdquo;. This done, I rebooted
using the floppy disk, and used FIPS to non-destructively shrink
the Windows partition to about 400MB, leaving 600 free for Linux
(which so far has proven adequate). I then shut down, swapped back
to the CD-ROM, rebooted from the hard drive into Windows, and ran
Red Hat's &ldquo;autoboot.bat&rdquo; to boot off the CD. (Red Hat could have
made this even easier by making the CD directly bootable; the
420D's BIOS can boot from CD-ROM.)</p><p>From here, the installation was as easy as any Unix or
Unix-like install I've ever done, and I've done quite a few,
including Ultrix, SunOS 4.1 and Solaris 2.5. I used Linux FDISK to
set up five partitions, one primary: root (50MB); and one extended
with three logical: /usr (300MB), /home (230MB) and swap (16MB). I
installed most of the typical packages, including TeX and XFree86,
although I later wound up pruning some of the documentation and
games to gain back extra space. In the end, however, I was able to
load what I wanted and needed and still have room to spare.</p><p>In retrospect, since the /home partition is going to be
entirely for me, and primarily for storing text files, it could
have been smaller, and /usr a bit larger (perhaps 350MB for /usr
and 180MB for /home). As it is, I wound up migrating X11R6 (44MB)
over to /home and putting a symbolic link back to /usr/X11R6, which
works fine and balances out the disk space adequately. The result
leaves me plenty of room for the Linux kernel sources and with room
to grow.</p><p>Once in place, everything more or less worked with one
glaring exception, which I'll get to in a moment. The track pad
appears as a PS/2-style mouse (and is touch-sensitive so you can
tap instead of click the left-button), the keyboard as a standard
PC-101 keyboard and the screen appears as a typical VGA screen. The
Lifebook's BIOS is APM (Advanced Power Management) compliant, so
the kernel's APM extensions are able to work perfectly (although
Red Hat 4.1 did not include the APM utilities). I even tried
suspending the machine, using the suspend button, while in the
middle of compiling a program; the system resumed when I told it to
without any problem.</p><p>All the standard ports are recognized, and the PC Card slots
appear to work fine with the pcmcia-cs drivers. (Red Hat 4.1
shipped with the pcmcia-cs 2.8.25 drivers and the 2.0.27 kernel,
which may well work adequately; I had upgraded to 2.9.5 and kernel
2.0.30 before testing the PC Card slots, however.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c0d580.0x1d06000"></a>Minor Quibbles</h2></div></div><p>I do have a few minor quibbles when comparing this unit to
what might be my more &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; machine. On the other hand, I
recognize that most of what would make up my &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; machine
would result in a price that was well outside of my range. Looked
at in the larger picture, the trade-off of features for
availability represented by the Lifebook 420D is an excellent
one.</p><p>The Dual Scan screen is fairly good as such things go, but
nothing quite compares to Active Matrix. Even this DS screen
suffers from ghosting and a little bit of cursor &ldquo;submarining&rdquo;.
However, it is fairly fast and pretty crisp. Once I got X-Windows
to run correctly (more shortly), I was greeted with surprisingly
sharp color. Given that Active Matrix would probably add $1000US to
the price tag, I'd say that this particular trade-off is well worth
it.</p><p>The lack of either a built in SCSI port or a modem is a bit
of a bother. A SCSI port, in particular, would be useful for
hooking up my Jaz drive so that I could do backups (1.08GB hard
drive, 1GB Jaz platter). The modem's absence is less important to
me, personally, but seems very strange in this age of Internet
madness, particularly since they
<span   class="bold"><b>do</b></span> bundle various on-line service
programs by default. The inclusion of these two things, however,
would probably have added $300-$400US to the sticker, and since I
do already have a modem, and PC Card SCSI adapters can be had for
just over $100US, this trade-off, too, is one I think I agree
with.</p><p>The Lifebook comes with a &ldquo;port replicator&rdquo; docking port,
but the existing port replicator product for the Lifebook 500
series does not work with it, and Fujitsu has yet to release the
&ldquo;mini-docking station&rdquo; that will. They have not even announced
what the docking station will include, or at least, if they have, I
haven't seen it anywhere on their web site. The annoying part about
this is that the Lifebook 500 series replicator sells for $189US,
but the docking station will, according to a salesman at Computer
City, sell for $369US. For that price, the docking station had
better have the two things I just griped about: a SCSI port and a
modem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c0d580.0x1d06268"></a>The Big Quibble</h2></div></div><p>Everything I've described so far falls under the heading of
acceptable trade-offs in a budget notebook computer. My largest
complaint does not. Fujitsu has made one particular design decision
which, despite all the great things about this unit, makes it very
difficult for me to give an unalloyed endorsement to this
product.</p><p>The Lifebook 420D uses a NeoMagic 128v model 2093 graphics
chip to drive its LCD panel and SVGA-out port. This has become a
very popular choice with a number of portable manufacturers,
including Dell, Toshiba, IBM and DEC. From what I can gather, this
decision has been taken in part because NeoMagic has succeeded in
squeezing the entire video works, including hardware acceleration,
onto a single chip, rather than a set of chips, a major win for
price, packaging and power consumption, no doubt.</p><p>Looked at without concern for specific operating system
support, this is a perfectly good trade-off. The NeoMagic chip
produces excellent results, and I have little doubt that part of
the reason the Dual Scan screen is so usable is that the NeoMagic
chip is so good at what it does.</p><p>Unfortunately, according to folks at the XFree86 project,
NeoMagic has chosen to keep the programming specifications of their
chip proprietary. The result is free software authors such as the
XFree86 group cannot obtain the specifications to write and release
drivers that will take full advantage of the chip without
compromising on the principle of free software. This seems to be a
very backward policy on NeoMagic's part given that larger
competitors such as Diamond and Matrox have begun working more
openly with the free software community.</p><p>What this means for the end user is that they're left with
two not-so-great choices. The first is to run XFree86's VGA16
server, which has a good enough &ldquo;generic&rdquo; driver to run even the
NeoMagic chip at 800x600, but in only 16 colors. The second is to
run Xi Graphic's Accelerated X LX product, which does have a
complete driver for the NeoMagic chip, but costs $200US&mdash;twice the
cost of the more common AX desktop product. MetroLink has informed
me that they are considering supporting the NeoMagic chip in the
near future, so you may eventually be able to use Metro-X as a
commercial alternative, as well.</p><p>With either current solution, a &ldquo;trick&rdquo; is required either
in the kernel itself or in lilo.conf to force the video system into
&ldquo;graphics&rdquo; mode immediately at boot-up. Without this trick, the
800x600 image shows up offset by an inch to the right, leaving a
black gap on the left and cutting off the rightmost portion of the
desktop entirely. Unfortunately, using this solution means that you
lose the ability to track boot-time messages as they happen. This
isn't a big problem for me; I've used Macintoshes, which have no
boot-time messages, for years. I've also left an alternate,
text-mode configuration in my lilo.conf for emergencies. It also
means you have to use the X Display Manager to present a login
screen, but most current Linux distributions, including Red Hat,
provide an easy means of doing so in the form of a special &ldquo;run
level&rdquo; in /etc/inittab.</p><p>The details of how to configure these programs and lilo.conf
are beyond the scope of a review. If you want more information,
take a look at
http://www.publiccom.com/web/mikey/lifebooklinux.html, a page I've
set up specifically to cover these issues.</p><p>Accelerated X is a good product. However, I prefer free
software. The whole point of my buying this particular model was
that I didn't want to shell out a lot of money, so spending another
$200US after purchase doesn't thrill me. Fortunately, for my own
uses, 16 colors is plenty, so for now, I'm content with using the
XF86_VGA16 free server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c0d580.0x1d065d8"></a>The Bottom Line</h2></div></div><p>The Fujitsu Lifebook 420D is a solid, dependable (so far),
and above all affordable notebook computer. While not endowed with
all the latest gadgetry or the fastest hardware, it has more than
enough power to run Linux well, in large part because Linux takes
such good and efficient advantage of the hardware. While not
designed for very high speed or for very great range, it's an
excellent and inexpensive selection.</p><p>The only thing that prevents me from giving this product a
complete endorsement is the NeoMagic chip issue. I have politely
expressed my opinion of their proprietary attitude to both Fujitsu
and NeoMagic. I can only hope that some heed of the Linux market is
taken by either or, preferably, both companies.</p><p>If this particular issue <span   class="emphasis"><em>doesn't</em></span> bother
you or if, like me, you're willing to work around these problems if
it means you can have a portable computer without taking out a
second mortgage, then by all means check out this product. If, on
the other hand, you decide against the Fujitsu 420D specifically
because of the NeoMagic issue, then I suggest you express that
decision in a <span   class="emphasis"><em>politely worded</em></span> letter to both
Fujitsu and NeoMagic. It's a market-driven world; the only chance
we have of getting respect is to demonstrate that we are a market
worth considering.</p></div></div>
