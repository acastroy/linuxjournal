on this system. How can I change the password or verify my old
password? &mdash;Kevin Cary Red Hat 2.0.30</p><p>This is a much debated topic since it essentially involves
breaking your system's security. The main discussion point always
seems to be how to do it without letting people do it to others.
For the most part, it is easy to remove the root password from
Linux (and many other flavors of Unix) servers, as long as the
machine has a floppy drive that it boots from by default.</p><p>If you have a standard Linux system without shadow passwords,
you can simply boot from a &ldquo;boot and root&rdquo; floppy disk set, mount
your partition and edit the /etc/passwd file. In this file, fields
are separated by the colon (:) character. The second field on the
first line can be removed (so the entry looks like ::) and root
will no longer have a password. You can then reboot, log in as root
and use <span   class="bold"><b>passwd</b></span> to set the new root
password. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technical Services

low-level question, but I couldn't find help elsewhere. &mdash;Erik
Rask</p><p>That's a question that can easily spark religious debates,
but I'll side step that issue and just mention that there's a
rather well-written Distribution HOWTO available from any Linux
Documentation Project mirror (i.e., http://www.silug.org/LDP/) that
describes the differences between distributions. &mdash;Steven
Pritchard steve@silug.org</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d89580.0x1e81450"></a>Slow Modem Connection</h2></div></div><p>I need help in determining why my modem connection is so
slow. I have a 33.6Kb modem that runs fine in Windows, but I just
haven't found all of the files I must edit for making
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> run as fast as
possible. &mdash;Paul Carff</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> has a setting called
<b  >asyncmap</b>, that is a mask of characters which it
must escape. This masking allows pppd to be run across lines that
may not handle all 256 characters of the ASCII set. A common
example of this is a line that must use software flow control in
the form of the <b  >ctrl-S</b> and
<b  >ctrl-Q</b> characters to pace the flow of data.
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> cannot send those characters
directly since they would interfere with the operation of the flow
control; so, it sends another two characters (the escape and the
replacement character) instead.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>If no asyncmap parameter is set (as described in
the pppd man page), pppd will automatically escape</em></span> all
control characters just to be sure the transmission is not
interrupted. Obviously, this adds a good deal of overhead to the
transmissions. Setting the asyncmap to 0 results in a noticeable
increase in transfer rates on most systems. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT

setting up the mouse. I set the mouse port to 1, but the real mouse
port is 2. How can I change the mouse port?</p><p>&mdash;Moon Ill June</p><p>The best way is to run
<span   class="bold"><b>mouseconfig</b></span> from the command line.
It will let you choose the port just as you did at install
time. &mdash;Donnie Barnes, Red Hat Software redhat@redhat.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d89580.0x1e81a80"></a>Kernel Stack Corruption</h2></div></div><p>I am running 2.0.7 and have tried to compile the kernels of
2.0.27, 2.0.30 and 2.1.x, all of which give me the same error on
execution. All of the kernels compiled successfully, but they
crashed on bootup with the message &ldquo;<b  >kernel stack
  corruption</b>&rdquo;. What could be wrong? &mdash;Thomas S. Chin</p><p>Start by using a good memory checker to check your system
RAM. The kernels you listed are known to be stable, and the kernel
stack is somewhat difficult to corrupt since it's well protected by
the operating system.</p><p>Also, investigate your BIOS settings to make sure they match
your memory type and CPU-cache type. If it can be set, be sure your
BIOS has the same speed setting (60ns or 70ns) as your system RAM
and your cache type (write-back, write-through, et cetera) matches
what you actually have. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT Technical Services
Corporation chadr@brttech.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d89580.0x1e81c90"></a>Jumbled Text and Setting Color</h2></div></div><p>I like color as a means of segregating data and reducing eye
strain. I looked at all the escape sequence information I could
find and set PS1 (where _ is a space) to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
\033[36m\u_\033[33m\W_\$_--\033[32m_
</pre><p>The user name is cyan, the directory and root prompt are
brown and the rest is green. However, when I try to edit a history
command, strange things occur when backspacing and the command text
becomes jumbled. What am I missing? &mdash;Jim Red Hat 4.1
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>The shell probably doesn't care what escape
sequences you use. The problem area is more likely your terminal.
Investigate the terminal program you are using to log in and be
sure it supports proper ANSI sequences. Be sure that it properly
handles setting a color when another is already set. Never
turn</em></span> off colors at the end of your prompt. Try an
<b  >esc[0m</b> at the end of the line (sacrificing color
for the text you type) and see if that helps.</p><p>This is especially true since a colorized
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> listing causes trouble for you.
The listing is turning on and off individual colors (with the
default ls settings), and terminals that don't support it will have
problems with pre-existing color settings. &mdash;Chad Robinson, BRT
Technical Services Corporation chadr@brttech.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d89580.0x1e82000"></a>Setting Time</h2></div></div><p>Although my DEC Alpha NFS server and the Linux machines all
have the same local time, every file written to the NFS partition
in the Linux machines is one hour (exactly one hour) ahead in time.
For example, if both the server and a Linux client have 20:30, and
the client writes a file to the NFS partition, the time of creation
of the file is 21:30. How can I correct this problem?  &mdash;Jose Luis
Richardo ChavezRed Hat Linux 4.2 and 4.1</p><p>Linux adjusts the time displayed by the
<span   class="bold"><b>date</b></span> command for your local time
zone. It's possible to see the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; time from
<span   class="bold"><b>date</b></span>, if your system's internal
notion of the correct time and the time zone setting are both
wrong. For example, if your internal clock is an hour fast, but
your time zone is an hour behind, you'll see the behavior you
described. Check the time zone output in the date command. For
example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Mon Aug 4 12:12:53 PDT 1997
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>indicates we are currently running Pacific Daylight
Time. On Red Hat systems you want /etc/localtime to be a link to a
file in /usr/lib/zoneinfo.</em></span>
</p><p>Also, you generally want your system to store time in your
local time. Edit the /etc/sysconfig/clock file, so that you
have:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
UTC=false
ARC=true
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Then go into your system's BIOS setup to check that
the local time is set correctly. &mdash;Larry M. Augustin, VA

Seisums Slackware 1.3.20</p><p>I'll assume you've got X and XDM set up properly; if not,
read the man page. Most distributions provide an XDM setup that
works, so you may be able to just use it. Also, make sure you can
use <span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> to get into X after
logging on in the normal way.</p><p>Next, look for a line like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
id:5:initdefault
</pre><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>in your /etc/inittab file. This will tell you what
run level init starts at. The run level is the number in the
middle. Add a line like this:</em></span>
<pre     class="programlisting">
x:5:respawn:/usr/bin/X11/xdm -nodaemon
</pre>


<span   class="emphasis"><em>to the /etc/inittab file. For the 5 shown above,
substitute the run level you're running at&mdash;then reboot.</em></span>
</p><p>If you want to test this first (good idea), pick a different
run level (one below) to run XDM at. Don't pick 0, 1 or 6 as these
have special meanings. Then, as root, run
<b  >telinit&lt;\!s&gt;runlevel</b> to switch to that run
level. If it doesn't work,
<b  >telinit&lt;\!s&gt;regular&lt;\!s&gt;runlevel</b>
will switch you back. &mdash;Jeff Licquia jeff@web.lanscape.net</p></div></div>
