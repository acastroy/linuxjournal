    This article demonstrates how to write graphical
    applications using a MetaCard scripting language called
    MetaTalk.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29d5580.0x2acd348"></a></h2></div></div><p>A <span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span>
program is a very useful thing to have on a multi-tasking operating
system like Linux. You can use it to keep track of the CPU and
memory usage of all programs running on the system and to detect
and kill runaway processes. The character-based
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> program that comes with Linux
systems can be improved. Because it isn't aware of the windowing
system, it doesn't go to sleep when the window it is running in is
iconified. It would also be nice if you could select a process to
kill by clicking on it instead of having
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> type in its process ID.
</p><p>Fortunately, Linux has a very simple and elegant way to get
process information, and so it's easy to develop a graphical
application to display this information using a tool like MetaCard.
This article will show you how it's done using MetaCard's scripting
language MetaTalk. MetaTalk is a very high level language (VHLL)
that supports building complete applications with very little
effort. The MetaTalk language has an English-like syntax and is
very concise. This makes it easy to learn, yet doesn't sacrifice
the power and compactness found in other HVLLs such as Perl. It is
very readable, so it's easy for non-expert users to figure out what
a script does (which can be much more difficult with languages like
Perl).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29d5580.0x2acd5b0"></a>The /proc Pseudo File System</h2></div></div><p>Each process that is running on a Linux system has a
directory in /proc. In that directory are several files containing
information on the process. To implement a graphical
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> program, we're most interested
in the information in the file named <span   class="emphasis"><em>stat</em></span>,
which contains process run time and memory usage information. We'll
also use the file named <span   class="emphasis"><em>cmdline</em></span> that contains
the command line used to start up that process.</p><p>The stat file contains a single line of information with the
fields separated by spaces. Details on the format can be found in
the proc man page. Information on this page indicates that on a
Linux 1.2 system, words 14 and 15 are the user and system run
times, respectively, for a particular process. Word 23 is the
process size in bytes, and word 24 is the number of 4KB pages
currently in RAM for that process.</p><p>There are also files in the /proc system that contain
information about the whole system. We'll use the /proc/stat file
which contains overall system resource usage. We'll need that
information to compute the percentage of CPU usage for each
process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29d5580.0x2acd870"></a>The procedure</h2></div></div><p>Each time the display is to be updated, a program must do the
following:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Read the stat file in the /proc directory.</p></li><li><p>Find all of the subdirectories in the /proc
directory.</p></li><li><p>Read the stat and cmdline files in each of these
directories.</p></li><li><p>Compute the CPU time for the process by subtracting
from the last time.</p></li><li><p>Save the current CPU usage.</p></li><li><p>Convert the CPU usage into a percentage of total
usage.</p></li><li><p>Build the list of processes and display it.</p></li><li><p>Schedule a time to redo the update.</p></li></ol></div><p>The MetaTalk handler that does all of these things is called
<b  >updatelist</b> and is shown in
<a href="2110l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. This handler, like all
MetaTalk message handlers, starts with the word
<b  >on</b> and the name of the message to be handled.
The first few lines of this handler declare all the local variables
used in this handler. While not strictly necessary, it's a good
idea to declare variables to avoid bugs caused by misspelling
variable names. To check your scripts, you can set the MetaCard
property <b  >explicitVariables</b>, which will flag as
an error any variable used before it was declared.</p><p>The handler then gets the global system time statistics from
the file /proc/stat and subtracts the values from the last time the
handler was called. The time statistics are then stored in a local
variable declared outside the handler, which works like a
&ldquo;static&rdquo; variable in C. That is, it retains its value like a
global, but can only be referred to within the script, so it
doesn't pollute the global name space. This variable, like all
MetaTalk variables, can be used as an associative array without
special declarations. All you have to do is put an alphanumeric
string between the [] (square brackets).</p><p>Note the expressions of the form &ldquo;<b  >word x of
y</b>&rdquo;. These are called &ldquo;chunk&rdquo; expressions and are a
very powerful feature of MetaTalk. With them you can access
elements of a string individually without having to split up the
whole string into an array first. Also note that you can add words
together without having to explicitly convert them into numbers
first. This saves development time and makes scripts smaller than
they would be in lower-level languages.</p><p>The readfile function used in the updatelist handler is shown
in <a href="2110l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>. Like all function
handlers, it starts with the keyword <b  >function</b>
and is used in expressions just like MetaCard built-in
functions.</p><p>There is one unusual thing about this function. Normally in
MetaCard, one would use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
read from file x until eof
</pre><p>because when you specify <b  >eof</b> as the
terminating condition, MetaCard speeds things up by getting the
file size and reading the whole file with a single system call.
This doesn't work for /proc files since the stat() system call
returns the file lengths as 0 bytes, even though they contain data.
Therefore, we must force MetaCard to read the file a byte at a time
by specifying <b  >empty</b> as the terminating
condition.
</p><p>The readfile function also has to handle the case where the
file specified doesn't exist, which can happen if the process exits
after the <b  >ls</b> command that obtains the directory
contents is executed. It also needs to convert nulls (ASCII 0
characters) in the strings to spaces, since some of the files use
this character as a delimiter. Note that this requires a scripting
language that can handle binary data. MetaTalk has no problem with
this, but many other scripting languages do.</p><p>The rest of the updatelist handler does steps 2 through 7 in
the above recipe. The resulting listing is sorted twice to remedy
one of the more annoying characteristics of the character-based
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> program: the individual
processes bounce around the listing unpredictably if they're not
using any CPU time. Instead, we'll sort them by process size and
then by CPU time which is a more useful way to do it. This is only
possible because MetaCard's sort is stable, which means order is
preserved on sequential sorts if elements have the same key
value.</p><p>Finally, the updatelist handler uses the
<span   class="bold"><b>send</b></span> command to schedule a call
back to itself in a few seconds and stores the ID of the timer
<span   class="bold"><b>send</b></span> creates in a variable. This
local variable can be used to cancel the timer using the
<span   class="bold"><b>cancel</b></span> function. For example, when
the application is iconified, we want to stop the processing (See
Listing 3).</p><p>I snuck in a bit of object-oriented programming in the
<b  >send</b> command. The message, sent to &ldquo;me&rdquo;, is
the object whose script is currently executing. The time interval
is specified as &ldquo;<b  >the update interval of me</b>&rdquo;.
This object has a custom property named
<b  >updateinterval</b> that is persistent, which means
it's saved whenever the object is saved. That's why you don't see
any initialization of this property in these listings; it's data
stored with the stack, not the code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29d5580.0x2ace8f0"></a>Building a stack</h2></div></div><p>Backtracking a little, before you can write a script, you
need to create an object to attach the script to. MetaCard
applications are composed of one or more stacks, each of which has
one or more cards. The metaphor (inherited from HyperCard) is of a
stack of index cards, but you can also think of it as being pages
in a book, slides in a presentation or the frames in a movie or
video. The stacks are stored as binary files similar to the
resource files used on the Mac and Windows. But in addition to
object descriptions, data such as the state of buttons and the text
in fields is also stored in these files.</p><p>The objects are created, sized and positioned using
MetaCard's IDE (Integrated Development Environment). To start
building a new application window, choose &ldquo;New Stack&rdquo; from the
File menu (the first card is created automatically with the stack).
Then choose tools from the tool bar and draw the fields and buttons
you need. See Figure 1 for a screen snapshot of the MetaCard
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> application.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="2110f1.large.jpg"><img src="2110f1.jpg"></a></div><p>After creating the stack and the controls in it, you can add
scripts to the stack, cards and/or controls. Normally each object
has its own script, but I've put all of the handlers for the
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> program in the card script.
This means that the mouseUp handler (see
<a href="2110l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>) is a little unusual,
since it gets called through the message-passing hierarchy:
messages not handled by an object can be handled by objects higher
up in the hierarchy. In this case, a handler in the card script
handles messages sent to any of the controls on the card.</p><p>Writing one big handler instead of a bunch of small ones
usually means you have to figure out which object the message was
originally sent to. The <span   class="bold"><b>target</b></span>
function supplies this information. The target function returns an
object that you can get the properties of or send messages to. This
<span   class="bold"><b>mouseUp</b></span> handler also shows off the
MetaCard <b  >switch</b> control structure:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The &ldquo;Kill Process&rdquo; case is executed when the user
clicks on the &ldquo;Kill Process&rdquo; button. This section gets the PID of
the process from the selected line in field and uses the MetaTalk
<span   class="bold"><b>kill</b></span> command to kill it.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;Set Update Interval...&rdquo; section prompts the
user for the new <span   class="emphasis"><em>updateinterval</em></span> value using
the <span   class="bold"><b>ask</b></span> dialog, verifies that the
value is a number and tells the user that it must be if it isn't.
The <span   class="bold"><b>ask</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>answer</b></span> dialogs are built into
MetaCard and are quick and easy ways to get simple responses from
the user. If the new data checks out OK, the handler cancels the
current timer and then calls the updatelist handler to restart
it.</p></li><li><p>The &ldquo;toplist&rdquo; case will be executed when the user
clicks on a line in the main field. This case enables the &ldquo;Kill
Process&rdquo; button and suppresses updates for 5 seconds, allowing the
user time to kill the process before the selection is cleared when
the field is next updated.</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="2110l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a> shows the handlers
for the stack-oriented messages, including those sent when the
stack opens and closes and is iconified and uniconfied. Remember
the goal of having the application go to sleep when it is
iconified.</p><p>MetaCard doesn't have a constraint-based geometry system, so
you must write scripts to handle resizing and repositioning
controls when a stack window is resized. The
<span   class="bold"><b>resizeStack</b></span> message handler that
does this geometry management is shown in Listing 2. Using the IDE,
I set the stack properties such that the stack is not resizable in
width, only in height (since you need to be able to see all
fields). So this handler only has to resize the main field
vertically and reposition the buttons along the bottom edge of the
display. This simple four-statement handler reliably handles the
task without triggering the time-consuming trial-and-error phase of
development required to get a constraint-based system working
correctly.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29d5580.0x2ec75e8"></a>Performance characteristics</h2></div></div><p>Running the MetaCard version of
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> takes about twice as much CPU
time as the character-based version (6% vs. 3% on a Pentium 90
running Linux 1.2.13). This is a typical result, since a
well-written MetaCard script generally runs 2 to 4 times slower
than a comparable C program. Of course, the MetaCard version only
took a fraction of time to develop. And because it is so much
smaller, it will take far less time and effort to maintain and
customize. The character-based <span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span>
program is written in C and is about 10 times as long. Memory usage
for the MetaCard version of <span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> is
considerably less than the total of the character-based
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> program added to the memory
needed for the xterm and the extra bash process required to run
it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29d5580.0x2ec7850"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>The real power of this graphical
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span> is that it's easy to modify to
suit your needs. You could easily add columns to display some of
the other information shown in the character-based
<span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span>, or change the signal used to
kill a process. Since MetaCard has built-in object graphics
capabilities, you could even add a graphical display of the
resources used by individual processes over time.</p><p>You can get the MetaCard <span   class="bold"><b>top</b></span>
stack from <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s
<a href="../listings/043/2110.tgz" target="_self">ftp
site</a>, but you'll need to get the MetaCard engine from the
MetaCard WWW site http://www.metacard.com or FTP site
ftp://ftp.metacard.com/MetaCard/.</p></div></div>
