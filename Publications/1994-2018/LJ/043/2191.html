    Using Linux as a base to implement advanced telphony

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113a580.0x12324a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In &ldquo;Let Linux Speak&rdquo;
(<i  >LJ</i>, January, 1997), I demonstrated some fun
applications for the SPO256 text-to-speech board. Buried in that
article was a brief discussion on the potential for using
text-to-speech as a telephony resource and for using Linux as a
telephony services platform.
</p><p>Talking about &ldquo;telephony services&rdquo;, or computer telephony
in general, can mean many things. The history of computer
telephony, while an interesting subject, is not our primary focus.
Instead, I will discuss the use of Linux as a platform for voice
response and path switching, for PBX integration and switch call
control, and for the extension of traditional voice applications
onto the Internet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113a580.0x1232660"></a>Telephony Overview</h2></div></div><p>Voice response includes many applications such as traditional
voice mail and interactive voice response (IVR) systems utilized as
automatic &ldquo;dial and survey&rdquo; machines. These applications are
typically built around multi-channel voice telephony boards that
capture and play back digitized speech and that generate and listen
for DTMF digits and call progress tones. The more advanced of these
boards offer on board DSP resources, emulate FAX/modem services and
perform speech recognition. The largest single vendor of this kind
of board is the Dialogic Corporation.</p><p>PBX integration involves direct computer control of a PBX
switching system. Many vendors have specialized boards and/or
serial interfaces which run proprietary protocols for gaining
access to different switch features. Generally, PBX integration is
implemented as a telephony server or API, such as Microsoft TAPI or
TSAPI (currently supported only under Novell Netware). Usually,
these APIs implement first party call control for desktop
applications (such as putting a telephone image and dialer on a
desktop, controlling a digital telephone directly as a &ldquo;terminal
device&rdquo;) or as third party call control for server applications
(such as ACD: automatic call distributors).</p><p>The whole area of Internet telephony is vastly interesting
and intriguing. Most often, the first thing that comes to mind when
one says &ldquo;Internet telephony&rdquo; are those nifty programs that allow
computer users to place low-grade international telephone calls for
free over the Internet. This same technology, when applied on a
private corporate LAN with sufficient bandwidth, could provide a
cheap means of inter-office switching (much like tie line services
and expensive private T-1 networks) and a better solution for ACD
agent positions.</p><p>Traditional low-cost telephony solutions have historically
been implemented either under MS-DOS (with, perhaps, a custom
real-time kernel) or under OS/2. The need for highly specialized
real-time operating systems to drive multi-channel voice
applications has disappeared as a result of increased CPU power,
and equally important, the increased sophistication and power of
add-on telephony boards. Many of these boards now manage I/O and
call state largely on their own with only an occasional need for
direct intervention. In the past guaranteed maximum interrupt
latency was the mantra for evaluating real-time performance in
complex voice processing systems; I now find support for real-time
predictable scheduling policies more important.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113a580.0x1232870"></a>A Look at Operating Systems for
Telephony</h2></div></div><p>While Windows NT is commonly touted as a &ldquo;telephony
operating system&rdquo; these days, there are several serious
considerations. The first is simply expense; a Windows NT machine
means a machine with a video display. More often, telephony
applications are deployed on dedicated stand-alone machines which
sit in phone closets and, ideally, require only remote
management.</p><p>Some of the same optimizations that make NT work better than
Windows 95 as a desktop machine get in the way of using it for
telephony applications, or for use as a telephony server and
workstation concurrently. For example, one finds strange scheduling
quirks that occur as NT optimized video drivers, which are now
given the highest priority, update large areas of the
screen.</p><p>Finally, even in today's world of cheap RAM, NT requires a
minimum of 32MB, while Linux runs smoothly in 8MB or less. Even in
the low-end commodity voice market, where MS-DOS-based voice mail
systems predominate and a $50.00 change in margins can make or
break a product, these costs are very important. Now, imagine a
$2000 voice mail system, or, even better, a $1000 voice mail
&ldquo;machine&rdquo;, with desktop integration, multi-site networking and
voice/email exchange, and what that system would do to the bottom
of the commercial voice mail market.</p><p>Why not OS/2? Well, first there is always the question of
&ldquo;will it be around?&rdquo; Second, the last non-desktop optimized
release of OS/2 was 1.3, and it is still the most commonly used and
supported release of OS/2 in voice processing products today. OS/2
driver support still exists in the voice response OEM marketplace,
but it is not a rising star.</p><p>Why not DOS? Simply put, one cannot easily run network
services from a DOS machine. In tomorrow's world, voice mail will
have to present voice messages on the desktop, whether through
proprietary means or through a web server and standard e-mail
protocols. Other advanced user applications and networking services
will need to be leveraged onto these once dedicated stand-alone
voice processing machines.</p><p>And what about Unix? For many years, some variants of Unix
have been used successfully in voice processing, typically in
vertical market applications. The complete failure of the major
Unix vendors to understand the CTI market and create appropriate
software licensing terms or stripped down embedded releases have
kept the cost of using these systems prohibitively expensive as a
general purpose CTI platform. For example, a Unix machine for voice
processing may not need NFS, many user utilities or X Windows.
However, it does need sockets and a web server for administration
and desktop telephony. No major Unix vendor seems to know how to
properly license such a stripped down, embedded
configuration.</p><p>So what are we left with? An inexpensive operating system
capable of using inexpensive hardware, of running a mix of user and
real-time scheduled processes, of remote management without the
need for a local console, of integrated networking and of giving
months of reliable service unattended. Only Linux and Free-BSD fit
these criteria.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113a580.0x1232b88"></a>PBX Integration</h2></div></div><p>As mentioned earlier, most vendors support some form of
direct PBX integration. By far the most common method of
integration, in the broadest sense, is &ldquo;call detail&rdquo;. Virtually
every PBX on the market is capable of generating call detail, also
available as serial data, that can be used for call accounting
systems.</p><p>Call detail is often represented by different formats from
different manufacturers, and may change within different releases
of the same base product. The kind of information varies from
simple information on in-bound/out-bound trunk usage (for example,
number called, date and time, duration and extension called from)
to complete call traces, whereby every aspect of a call's passage
through a PBX is detailed.</p><p>Most PBXs support &ldquo;programming ports&rdquo;, which are
essentially serial ports hooked up to a dumb terminal or PC running
a terminal program like ProComm. These programming ports are
typically connected to modems to allow remote maintenance of the
PBX.</p><p>The programming port is quite useful and is often overlooked.
From it one can find and change every aspect of a typical PBX
system, such as hunt groups, directory number assignments, ringing
and restriction patterns, forwarding, feature buttons on digital
sets, etc. However, each piece of telephony equipment is different
in the way that it handles programming. The Fujitsu F9600 has
perhaps one of the easiest command languages to integrate, in that
the programming interface is represented as a shell, with a
shell-like command language and predictable response strings for
both successful and failed commands. This makes it ideal for use
with dumb serial terminals or automatic program control.</p><p>Some systems, such as the Nitsuko 384i, implement their
program port as a menu system on the assumption that the tech
maintaining the switch is on a form of ANSI terminal. Others that
have a serial programming interface, such as the Panasonic DBS,
behave and accept commands as if they were a digital telephone set,
and are more unusual. These systems require a lot of work to be
usable from an application standpoint.</p><p>One universal form of integration, though not widely
implemented, is SMDI. SMDI is a protocol originally developed by
Bell Labs for central office automated call response equipment.
SMDI, when available, is commonly used for voice mail
integration.</p><p>SMDI is carried on a serial port, and involves a simple,
standardized protocol for sending commands and receiving messages
from a PBX. Unfortunately, SMDI is pretty much limited to
identifying the origin of a call, when it appears on a &ldquo;message
detail&rdquo; extension (e.g., the extension of an attached voice mail
system), and control of &ldquo;message waiting&rdquo; indicator lamps on
phones. However, as this functionality is useful to basic voice
mail systems, we will discuss SMDI again later in this
article.</p><p>Systems that do not provide SMDI use tones for signaling and
integration of third party voice mail systems. These tones are
DTMF, and appear on the port(s) where the attached voice mail or
IVR application handles its voice path. Since this form of
integration is very limited and involves voice boards, I won't
discuss it further.</p><p>This leaves us with a broad class of &ldquo;other&rdquo; integration
ports. These are typically serial ports with a custom API or
communication board. They use proprietary protocols to indicate
signaling and control activity as calls pass in to, or are
generated out of, a telephone switch. The nature of these messages
vary widely from one vendor to another.</p><p>Some vendors are very keen on providing support for third
parties to develop call control applications. Harris, in
particular, not only documents their primary serial control
protocols (known as Harris HIL and WIL respectively), but also
provide third parties with actual source code that demonstrates how
to implement their protocols. Other vendors, such as Fujitsu,
provide full technical documentation and specifications for their
protocols to interested third parties. The English is a little poor
in the Fujitsu documentation, but at least they make some effort to
promote their interface (TCSI).</p><p>Alas, many vendors feel there is need to keep such
information secret. Doing so has slowed the widespread development
of general purpose computer telephony application interfaces and
restricted development to a very limited set of players; namely,
Novell TSAPI and Microsoft TAPI. This wall of secrecy limits most
third parties from creating more advanced integrations around the
strengths of a specific brand of equipment's feature set and
permits the manufacturer to pick and choose who will be allowed to
directly integrate their product.</p><p>Let's take a look at the Fujitsu F9600 PBX in detail. It
includes a serial port for programming. Fault messages and system
status and call detail also flow out of this port. It has an
optional board with a synchronous 19.2Kbps TCSI interface known as
TCSI. Considering the fact that it is a slow speed link, it seems
unnecessary.</p><p>In addition, Fujitsu has their own telephony architecture
built around a telephony server. This telephony server runs under
SCO (ODT 3) Unix and provides a separate server for each port, as
well as some application servers. A primary telephony server is
used to control the TCSI interface through an Eicon HDLC/X.25
board. A second, separate server is used to control the programming
port. Several applications can reside on the telephony server, each
of which uses a separate server and communicates via TCP/IP
sessions to the MML (PBX programming interface) and TCSI servers.
In addition, an interface driver can be loaded under a separate
machine running Novell Netware, along with Novell Netware Telephony
Services, to provide a TSAPI interface to the PBX via the SCO
machine.</p><p>The multi-tiered server structure Fujitsu uses enables
applications to directly utilize TCSI services, the MML interface
or a generic universal API set (TSAPI). However, it uses two
separate machines and operating systems to build this structure,
and each low-level server is not directly aware of potentially
useful information contained in the other.</p><p>Other vendors hide the low-level interface to the PBX
completely and provide only a TSAPI (or TAPI) interface for their
switch. These interfaces use only the information found on one port
(the call control port) and ignore information available on the
programming port and the potential to create remote network
administration through the universal API.</p><p>In fact, the universal API concept as expressed in TAPI and
TSAPI is based on creating a model PBX call control system as a
server. A single API and single protocol is used between the
application and this universal server. The server is then
implemented by providing a lower level driver (service provider
interface) to figure out how this generic PBX model applies to the
peculiarities of the vendor's specific hardware and call control
model.</p><p>The single-model API fails in one of two ways. First, some
features of the model API are not available under a specific
vendor's low-level SPI driver due to the inability to represent and
recreate specific functionality within the universal call control
model. Second, really neat and unique features the vendor may
support beyond the basic universal model are unavailable unless,
like Fujitsu, a second direct protocol server is provided.</p><p>To solve these and other problems in advanced integration for
free and open systems, I completely abandoned the universal API and
single protocol hierarchical model used in TSAPI and TAPI. I feel a
better solution is a multi-protocol &ldquo;TServer&rdquo; used as a single
unified server and network point of entry for access to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> services that can be made network
accessible from a telephony switch:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>generic call control interfaces (such as a TAPI or
TSAPI call server)</p></li><li><p>programming interfaces</p></li><li><p>network SMDI (either directly from the switch or
emulated through the call control interface)</p></li><li><p>call detail recording</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113a580.0x12335d8"></a>The Panasonic DBS</h2></div></div><p>The Panasonic DBS is a widely used digital Hybrid Key system
(not to be confused with the Panasonic KXT). The choice of creating
a model server around the DBS was predicated on both immediate
familiarity with the internals of this switch and availability of
hardware on which to test.</p><p>The DBS has two interfaces that can be used. The first, a
built-in serial port, is used for
<span   class="bold"><b>both</b></span> programming and call detail
recording. For this reason, the server must be sensitive to the
current &ldquo;operating state&rdquo; of the port (i.e., whether it is
currently being used for programming). As mentioned earlier,
commands to the DBS programming port are represented in a manner
analogous to the way one would program the switch from a digital
key telephone.</p><p>To simplify the DBS serial programming for application use, I
created a simple protocol to send the &ldquo;change value&rdquo;, &ldquo;get
value&rdquo; and &ldquo;clear value&rdquo; requests which make up the conceptual
heart of the operations used for programming the DBS from a
telephone. These commands, and the specification of an address for
the values being affected, make up the essential elements of my DBS
programming protocol.</p><p>The DBS also includes an optional API card. This card has a
serial port used for call control and switching. This low-level
protocol is unidirectional and involves a message packet and access
negotiation protocol. The interface is serial, with no provision
for hardware flow control. Messages are essentially exchanged
between the host machine and the switch, similar to Fujitsu TCSI,
Harris HIL or other equipment. Later versions of the DBS API
include two serial ports, one of which has extended features to
support a Netware TSAPI server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113a580.0x1233840"></a>The Linux TServer</h2></div></div><p>With all these protocol interfaces to maintain and the need
to connect a single point of network entry, a monolithic server
cannot be used. Since the points of connection (API interface and
programming interface) can be used as a shared resource by multiple
applications simultaneously, a simple &ldquo;fork()ing&rdquo; server common
in Unix is inappropriate. Instead, there is a set of protocol
servers connected to a single &ldquo;traffic cop&rdquo;. This multi-protocol
traffic cop binds itself to a single network port address providing
universal access from a single network session and acts as the
primary TServer.</p><p>In the simplest approach, each protocol (interface) server is
run as a child process using anonymous pipes. The TServer accepts
and manages user application sessions. Anonymous pipes for the
protocol server are very fast and require low overhead, especially
with Linux.</p><p>In the DBS are several layers of servers for the API portion
of the interface. This layering behaves a little like a stream
driver stack, and it could probably be implemented as such under a
streamable Unix.</p><p>At the lowest layer is the DBS packet link driver
(<b  >papild</b>). This driver negotiates the
unidirectional packet exchange with the DBS and normalizes DBS
messages to a single fixed packet. The reason for a fixed size
packet is to allow transfer of all messages to occur between the
different protocol layers by performing atomic
<b  >read()</b> and <b  >write()</b> calls.
This method allows clean tracking of &ldquo;split&rdquo; messages on a
non-blocking pipe that has been overwritten past its buffer.</p><p>The DBS packet channel state driver
(<b  >papicsd</b>), is a second stream layer built from
pipes above <b  >papild</b>. This layer is aware of the
peculiar nature of the DBS wherein all message events are initiated
with regard to one or more channels, which are virtual station
ports associated with the DBS API card. Requests that may generate
reply messages are queued within <b  >papicsd</b>. If a
request with an expected reply fails, the
<b  >papicsd</b> layer can generate timeout events.
Similarly, the <b  >papicsd</b> layer is responsible for
glare resolution, a situation that occurs when attempting to take a
station <span   class="emphasis"><em>off hook</em></span> at the same time that an
incoming call occurs. Finally, the <b  >papicsd</b> layer
can trap ridiculous or meaningless commands, such as hanging up a
port that is already known to be on hook and returning generated
error messages back to the application.</p><p>By having a separate process for <b  >papild</b>
and <b  >papicsd</b>, they become easier to write and
debug. Also, since the DBS has no flow control,
<b  >papild</b> can be dedicated to I/O specific
operations and, perhaps, even run within real-time scheduling
constraints in Linux (2.0 and above). This, in conjunction with the
non-blocking atomic pipe as a means to drive packets up and down
the protocol layers, requires less overhead and works much more
smoothly than some of Panasonic's original QNX application products
for the DBS.</p><p>On the programming interface (labeled SMDR on the DBS), a
single process is used. When no programming requests are active, it
simply spools CDR data for call accounting purposes. When a
programming request occurs, the server changes state to a
programming port interface server and remains in that state until
30 seconds pass without any program requests being made.</p><p>In addition to the TServer itself, there is one more protocol
layer on the papi stack. This utility layer maps DBS API channel
states to station card and trunk states based on the live DBS API
data. This mapping layer, <b  >papiltu</b>, is
essentially a SPI-like layer, in that it represents the DBS's
current state in an intermediary form in terms of line and trunk
activity that may make more sense than the DBS API channel
architecture. This layer also holds the DBS station directory map,
which is learned during initialization from the programming
interface. The information it maps and maintains is shared with
other DBS related protocol servers (such as the SMDI server)
through a shared memory block.</p><p>By using the programming port and <b  >papiltu</b>,
the papi protocol stack is able to automatically configure itself
by reading current DBS programming without user application
programming and setup. This replaces the clumsy manual approach of
a &ldquo;channel configuration&rdquo; screen to separately program the API
port configuration, as used in earlier Panasonic application
products. The <b  >papiltu</b> functionality was
originally an integral part of the primary TServer application
server, but with the restrictions on publication of DBS API
material, it was made into a separate layer to facilitate
publication of the primary TServer source code, if none of the papi
stack sources can be published. This matter is still under
discussion. (See comments at the very end of article.)</p><p>The TServer line/trunk state maps actually make the TServer
behave a little like the SPI layer of TAPI or TSAPI, as it
represents an intermediate form between a generic PBX model and the
actual physical model. In this case, in addition to driving direct
hardware interface protocols, our TServer can communicate with
logical protocol drivers which are not directly connected to any
physical hardware.</p><p>One such logical protocol driver is the DBS SMDI driver.
Connected through anonymous pipes, like the
<b  >papicsd</b> and <b  >smdr</b> layer
drivers, the <b  >smdi</b> protocol driver talks to the
shared <b  >papicsd</b> by going back through its
connection to the TServer. Since it does not depend on a single
shared hardware resource, as does a real (physical) driver, an
instance of the SMDI driver is created (forked) for each client
application. This driver inherits the TServer socket accepted for
the client connection and the pipe back to TServer; hence,
communications between the SMDI emulation driver and the client
application is always direct (i.e., it has no TServer routing
overhead).</p><p>Based on the SMDI example, one can easily create protocol
modules and matching application interfaces to fully emulate TSAPI
or TAPI services directly. One can also talk to a vendor-specific
hardware protocol directly (such as the papi layers or SMDR
interface) or create entirely new arbitrary integration protocols.
The TServer, as a single point of contact traffic cop, allows the
client to perform authentication and to select the interface
protocol that the client application wishes to use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113a580.0x162c640"></a>TServer Applications</h2></div></div><p>An interesting feature of the DBS is the ability to turn a
large display telephone into a simple kind of terminal device. This
allows the display content to be controlled by the application, and
the application to receive input events when keys are pressed on
the telephone. Another feature is a special &ldquo;hot key&rdquo; (also known
as the ACD key), that functions as an &ldquo;attention&rdquo; key that
generates an API event when pressed, regardless of the current
telephone state.</p><p>One of the first DBS applications I created is a simple menu
program for attaching &ldquo;applets&rdquo; to a telephone. When the
attention key is pressed, a simple menu of applications appears
from which one can be selected. One such application is used to
immediately show status information for my server (how many users
on-line, uptime, etc.) along with a soft key menu item to force a
server reboot.</p><p>Another digital telephone application of mine is a more
advanced speed dialer that has no capacity limit and is
programmable from the telephone. This application resembles the
Fujitsu &ldquo;Dial-by-Name&rdquo; server application in concept. The DBS has
its own internal speed dialing directory. Since alphanumeric text
is hard to enter through the phone, I wrote a simple Visual Basic
program to connect to the SMDR programming protocol in order to
program DBS speed dialing.</p><p>A possible future application that comes to mind is
empowering users to program their own phones from the desktop or
perhaps from web pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x113a580.0x162c850"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Many opportunities exist for the use of free and open systems
in computer telephony, especially for those telephone vendors wise
enough to expand their marketing opportunities by allowing third
parties to freely address issues and applications beyond their own
immediate scope. While I choose to use the Panasonic DBS and, with
it, have accepted restrictions on disclosure and source
publication, several other vendors have expressed interest in
having their equipment featured in a follow-up article.</p><p>When I started this article, I became aware of the effort to
create a standard and open Internet protocol for telephony
integration, known as &ldquo;stp&rdquo;, Simple Telephony Protocol. After
some debate, I have chosen to fully embrace stp, and the current
software described in this article is being rewritten to support
and comply with the evolving stp standard. The name &ldquo;SwitchLink&rdquo;
has also been adopted for it (swilink for short). My intention is
that swilink will become widely available as a free and open
software package for release with all mainstream Linux
distributions. Thus, free and open telephony will become the norm
rather than the exception for Linux.</p><p>Recently, there has been considerable change in the attitudes
of several key hardware vendors in the telephony business with
regard to Linux. I now believe opportunities to write on the use of
Linux as a general purpose and high performance Internet telephony
platform may be possible much earlier than I anticipated.</p><p><a href="2191s1.html" target="_self">Glossary</a></p></div></div>
