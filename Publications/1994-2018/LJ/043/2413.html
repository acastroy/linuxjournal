    Mr. Rubini gives us an introduction to the ssh program
    suite and its features, so that we can establish secure communication
    channels.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1413580.0x150b450"></a></h2></div></div><p>The <span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>
program suite is an interesting way to establish a secure
communication channel between hosts across the Internet. It
replaces a few usual communication channels (such as
<span   class="bold"><b>telnet</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>rlogin</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>rsh</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span>) and provides equivalent
functionality via a new secure protocol. This article is meant to
introduce the user to ssh features without any pretense of being an
authoritative tutorial on security issues.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1413580.0x150b710"></a>Bureaucracy</h2></div></div><p>First of all, as usual with encryption material, let's throw
in some legalese. The Unix implementation of the package is
distributed free of charge for non-commercial use and can be
retrieved from major ftp sites around the world. The meaning of
&ldquo;non-commercial use&rdquo; is well stated in the
<b  >COPYING</b> file within the ssh distribution.
Non-commercial use includes use of the tool by people who work on
the Internet, provided ssh is not used as a selling argument.
However, being allowed by the license is not enough to use the
package. You must also ensure your government allows using
cryptographic material: some countries prohibit citizens from using
any type of cryptography.</p><p>As far as standardization is concerned, the IETF (Internet
Engineering Task Force) is working on the ssh idea. This means that
the protocol is going to be standardized and will always remain
throughly documented. Anyone can reimplement the software and
distribute her version with different copying policies. Although
there is no RFC about ssh yet, three Internet drafts are already
available which document the different aspects of the protocol. The
drafts I downloaded in June are going to expire on September 1,
1997, but new drafts (or a real Request For Comments) will be
released before that time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1413580.0x150b8c8"></a>The Problem</h2></div></div><p>The main aim of ssh is overcoming the security problems of
TELNET and rsh-like protocols. These protocols, though widely used,
are very weak as far as security is concerned: TELNET transmits
clear-text passwords over the network, while rsh and friends are
easily broken by spoofing techniques (skilled system administrators
or anyone with physical access to the wire can exploit the .rhosts
files to be granted access on remote computers). These
vulnerabilities are addressed by the ssh protocol by enforcing a
strong authentication scheme between the communicating
parties.</p><p>The protocol not only authenticates the client host with the
server, but also enforces encryption of all the data sent through
the established communication channel. Although encryption requires
some computational load in the communicating hosts, the user can be
confident that no sniffer can make sense out of network packets,
and nobody can forge packets to be granted access with the
server.</p><p>Finally, the protocol is designed to allow encapsulation of
other communication channels within an ssh stream, so that
non-encrypted protocols can benefit from ssh capabilities at no
cost. This feature is most useful for establishing secure X11
connections, but its use is much more flexible than just that
security.</p><p>As far as the user interface is concerned, the new programs
are designed as drop-in replacements for
<span   class="bold"><b>rsh</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>rlogin</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>rcp</b></span>. While the system
administrator needs to deal with the ssh issue at least to install
the package, the final user can happily ignore the fact that the
underlying communication mechanisms have been changed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1413580.0x150bbe0"></a>Overview of the Package</h2></div></div><p>The current version of ssh, as I'm writing this article, is
1.2.20. It is distributed with a
<span   class="bold"><b>configure</b></span> script, so that:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install
</pre><p>does the complete job of installing the package. Even if
<b  >/usr/local</b> belongs to you, you'll need to be a
privileged user in order to install ssh. This requirement is
necessary, because both the server and some client programs must be
able to open privileged TCP ports. Moreover, the package installs
its system-wide files in the /etc directory. If you must run an ssh
session without installing the programs as a privileged user, you
should first read the FAQ file, which describes how to accomplish
this without too much trouble.
</p><p>The program suite is made up of a server program, a few
clients and a pair of support tools. In order to become an ssh
server, the suggested action is to invoke
<span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span> from your initialization
files when the computer boots. The program is installed by default
in the /usr/local/sbin directory, and it listens to port 22/tcp of
the local host to accept incoming connections. You should add a
line like the following one to the /etc/services file, if it is not
already included:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ssh     22/tcp  # secure shell
</pre><p>It is possible to run sshd from /etc/inetd.conf, by passing
the <b  >-i</b> flag to the daemon. This practice is
discouraged, because the daemon can take several seconds to start,
as it generates an encryption key each time it starts.
</p><p>On the client side, nothing needs to be done at installation
time to enable use of the services. After installation, several
programs can be found in the /usr/local/bin directory that can be
executed by anyone. Here's a list of these programs:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span> (slogin): The
ssh client program behaves like rsh in that it executes a command
on a remote host, redirecting its own stdin, stdout and stderr to
the remote. If only one argument is specified in the command line,
it is taken as the remote host, and ssh opens a terminal session on
that host, just as <span   class="bold"><b>rlogin</b></span> does.
The <span   class="bold"><b>slogin</b></span> client is just a
symbolic link to ssh. Usually, the user is asked to provide a
password for authentication on the remote host.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>scp</b></span>: &ldquo;Secure
CoPy&rdquo; is a replacement for &ldquo;Remote CoPy&rdquo;. It uses the same
syntax and performs the same task, with the same security
enhancements offered by ssh. The user is usually prompted for a
password to perform authentication.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ssh-keygen</b></span>: This
program generates new keys associated to the user who invokes it.
The public key and the private key generated are saved by default
in the directory $HOME/.ssh/, in two files called identity and
identity.pub. A pair of keys is needed, when you wish to securely
log into the local host from outside without providing a
password.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ssh-agent</b></span>: This
program is meant to manage security for a user session. It stores
the private keys for the user and can be contacted by any child
process. See the man page for more information about
ssh-agent.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ssh-add</b></span>: This
program adds identities to the authentication agent.
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh-agent</b></span> must be an ancestor of
the process running ssh-add in order for them to
communicate.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>ssh-askpass</b></span>: This
short program is used internally by ssh-add and ssh-keygen to ask
for a pass phrase using the X graphical environment.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>make-ssh-known-hosts</b></span>:
This PEl script retrieves the public keys of all hosts in a domain;
it queries the DNS and talks with hosts belonging to a domain. This
program updates the /etc/ssh_known_hosts file to hold the new keys.
The program should be run periodically, usually via
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>, to reflect any change in
host public keys or new installations of ssh on hosts in the local
networks.</p></li></ul></div><p>Although the number of installed files might scare a novice
user, there's nothing new to learn as long as you just use the
plain ssh and scp client programs. The system administrator can
even choose to replace ssh for rsh and scp for rcp, so that secure
operation is completely transparent to the final user. Actually,
such a replacement is not completely transparent, since ssh
introduces a new feature not present in plain rsh or rlogin: X11
forwarding. This feature is considered a &ldquo;side effect&rdquo;of using
the ssh protocol and is described in the next section.</p><p>The role of the other programs is secondary. They help to set
up a good working environment to avoid typing too many passwords
during normal operation without compromising system security. While
knowing their internals is not essential for program operation, a
quick look over the documentation might provide interesting
insights about current encryption technology and can help in
configuring hosts to automate the login process.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1413580.0x150c9f8"></a>X11 Forwarding</h2></div></div><p>The ssh protocol is designed to be flexible and supports
multiplexing of several communication channels within a single TCP
stream. This design choice results in two effects: on one side the
implementation of the protocol is much more elaborate than other
TCP-based protocols, and on the other side the final user can
exploit the added flexibility to achieve new goals. One of these
goals is establishing secure communication channels between the X
server and client applications. This feature is enabled by default
whenever an ssh session is established.</p><p>The idea behind X11 forwarding is quite straightforward. The
ssh application runs locally and is able to connect to the local X
server without resorting to the network (via local Unix-domain
sockets). Remote graphic programs, on the other hand, can connect
locally to the sshd server which spawned the remote shell (via the
loopback network interface). The remote sshd can encapsulate
graphic data in the secure communication channel it owns, to
complete the path linking the graphic application and the X
server.</p><p>Figure 1 shows how a remote X application (running on a
computer named sandra) securely connects to the local X server (on
morgana).</p><p><a href="2413f1.jpg" target="_self"><span   class="bold"><b>Figure 1.
Secure Connection to X Server</b></span></a></p><p>When you log into a remote computer through ssh, the DISPLAY
environment variable is automatically set to a proper value, and no
user intervention is needed to establish the graphical channel. The
following screen-shot shows automatic assignment of DISPLAY:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
morgana% ssh sandra env | grep DISPLAY
DISPLAY=sandra.systemy.it:10.0
</pre><p>It is apparent how any graphic program invoked on sandra by
the ssh session will connnect to a local display (i.e., sandra:10).
</p><p>The ssh/sshd programs can also forward other TCP channels,
according to the user's needs. This capability can be activated by
specifying command-line switches to the client ssh program. I won't
describe the mechanisms here, as the manual page for ssh is well
written.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1413580.0x1905068"></a>Authentication</h2></div></div><p>The main problem when establishing a connection through an
insecure network is performing reliable authentication. The ssh
package is quite pedantic about authentication, and you'll be
prompted for your password more frequently than usual. Typing
passwords over and over is distressing and can be avoided by proper
configuration of system files. Note also that any password you type
is transmitted <span   class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> establishing the
encrypted communication channel.</p><p>You can type <b  >ssh -v</b> (verbose) to get a
report on what is happening. The information returned is very
useful if you are unexpectedly prompted for a password. Now, let's
look at the steps performed by ssh to authenticate a user in the
remote server.</p><p>First, if the target account has no password, access is
granted. If it does, different kinds of authentication engines are
tried; each of which can be enabled or disabled into the server.
For example, by default &ldquo;PasswordAuthentication&rdquo; and
&ldquo;RhostsRSAAuthentication&rdquo; are enabled, and
&ldquo;RhostsAuthentication&rdquo; is disabled.</p><p>The following is the sequence of actions when you try to log
into a server running with the default configuration&mdash;which can be
changed in /etc/sshd_config.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The client receives the public key of the server.
If it is not recognized, ssh asks the user interactively if the
connection must be continued. By confirming, the user trusts that
the remote host matches its name, and the public key of the server
is saved on the client, in the file $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts. This
step is not performed if the server host is known system-wide
(i.e., it appears in /etc/ssh_known_hosts).</p></li><li><p>The client tries authenticating through
&ldquo;RhostsRSA&rdquo;. This requires that &ldquo;Rhosts&rdquo; authentication
succeeds: either .rhosts in the user's home directory or
/etc/hosts.equiv allows login.
<span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span> is more pedantic than
<span   class="bold"><b>rlogind</b></span> in checking these files
and denies permission if any of the files are group-writable or
world-writable. Needless to say, the entry beginning with the
&ldquo;plus&rdquo; character in either file is disregarded. Moreover, .rhosts
is not even used if the home directory of the user is
group-writable or world-writable, and /etc/hosts.equiv is not used
to authorize root logins. In addition to the standard files, sshd
also checks .shosts in the home directory of the user and
/etc/shosts.equiv. These files are useful if you still wish to run
rshd or rlogind on the server hosts by trusting fewer hosts than
you trust via ssh.</p></li><li><p>If the previous step succeeds, RSA is tried
(Random-State Authentication). This technique consists in the
client sending a challenge to the server, which must reply
correctly. The challenge consists of random data encrypted using
the client's private key; the server must decrypt such data and
return its checksum. The server can solve the challenge only if it
knows the public key of the client, which is known only if the
remote user agreed to trust the client (local) host. RSA is used to
prevent authorizing untrusted hosts which forge DNS records or
which temporarily steal the IP address of a trusted host.</p></li><li><p>If either of the previous steps fails, i.e., if
&ldquo;RhostsRSA Authentication&rdquo; as a whole fails, the client reverts
to &ldquo;Password Authentication&rdquo;, by asking for a password from the
local user.</p></li></ol></div><p>If your .rhosts file is correctly configured and you are
still prompted for a password, the problem is most likely caused by
RSA not succeeding. The easiest way to store the client's public
key in the server is invoking ssh right away to connect back to the
client computer. When confirming to continue the connection, the
server (now acting as a client) downloads the public key of the
local host (now acting as a server).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1413580.0x1905748"></a>Algorithms and Future Directions.</h2></div></div><p>The design of ssh is full of hooks for future extensibility.
First of all, the client and the server exchange a &ldquo;software
version&rdquo; and a &ldquo;protocol version&rdquo; at the beginning of each
section. While the &ldquo;software version&rdquo;is mainly used in debugging
problems, the &ldquo;protocol version&rdquo; is a great resource to
accomplish smooth upgrading from one version of the software to the
next one. Both the client and the server are required to support at
least the previous version of the protocol, in addition to the
current one. This requirement is designed to help deal with the
transition period whenever the protocol gets enhanced (which
doesn't happen too often). When running
<b  >ssh&lt;\!s&gt;-v</b>, you can see, among other
things, the exchange of version strings.</p><p>Another great design feature of the protocol is that new
cryptographic algorithms (&ldquo;ciphers&rdquo;) can be added to the basic
machinery without losing generality. This is accomplished by making
the choice of the cipher to use at runtime. During handshake (the
first few packets being exchanged by the communicating parties),
the server declares which ciphers it supports, and the client
chooses one of those ciphers. Every ssh implementation is required
to support at least 3DES, in order to ensure a secure link can be
established between any client and any server. Users and/or
organizations are, nevertheless, free to implement new ciphers and
specify them as the default choice. A few ciphers are part of the
official ssh distribution, and the user can ask for a specific
algorithm on the ssh command line to override the default.</p><p>The protocol also supports compression of session data. A
compressed session can actually be faster than a non-compressed
one, if the local network is slightly loaded. Once again,
compression is optional, and the communicating parties agree
whether or not to use it.</p><p>The standardization efforts endorsed by the IETF are aimed at
defining version 2.0 of the secure shell protocol (the version
supported by ssh-1.2.20 is called 1.5). The Internet drafts
currently available document three different aspects of the
upcoming 2.0 protocol:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>the connection protocol,
draft-ietf-secsh-connect-00.txt),</p></li><li><p>the transport-layer protocol,
draft-ietf-secsh-transport-00.txt)</p></li><li><p>the authentication protocol,
draft-ietf-secsh-userauth-00.txt.</p></li></ol></div><p>These documents are quite technical, but very interesting to
peruse. The protocol the IETF is working on looks promising, giving
even more flexibility than the current one.</p><p>The curious reader is urged to browse the network to retrieve
more information on these topics. I can provide a few pointers to
begin with, but I'm pretty sure you'll find several more pointers
about this kind of topic.</p><p><a href="2413s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
