customize and configure almost everything. This is also its
greatest downfall. Nine times out of ten, configuration requires
editing long and sometimes cryptic text files. One of the best
examples of this phenomenon is setting up an X server.</p><p>Most changes are made on a trial-and-error basis. This method
entails opening, editing, saving and trying the configuration file
over and over. When it finally works the way you wish, you pray you
don't have to change it again. Of course, as soon as you upgrade
your graphics card, it's editing time again. You can forget about
changing color depth on the fly&mdash;it's too bad if some of your
applications work only at 256 color and the rest allow true color.
If you want to use those 256 color applications, you will have to
run all your programs at 256 colors.</p><p>The X configuration is something Linux users have had to
endure like an ancient tribal ritual. It is often accompanied by
screams of frustration, loss of sleep and hardware flying across
the room.</p><p>Well, all that has changed with the advent of Metro-X.
Metro-X is an X server by Metro Link Incorporated. It is extremely
robust and easy to configure. Metro is available for most of the
leading x86 Unix platforms (Linux, Solaris x86, System V 4.0,
UnixWare and SCO). Red Hat has also started shipping Metro-X with
their commercial 4.x distribution of Linux.</p><p>Configuration is a snap. You are guided through the process
by a clean, well thought out Motif based GUI (see Figure 1). If you
make a mistake or upgrade hardware, changes can be made in a matter
of seconds.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2299f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Configuration GUI
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a7580.0x169fe48"></a>System Requirements</h2></div></div><p>Metro Link recommends a minimum configuration of 8MB of RAM
and 12MB of hard disk space. I would recommend a minimum of 16MB of
memory and a 486 33MHz CPU, as less than 16MB doesn't leave much
room for applications. Note that XFree86 must be on the system
before Metro-X can be installed, since Metro-X uses libraries and
fonts installed by XFree&mdash;Metro-X is not a complete replacement for
XFree86, just for the XFree86 X Server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a7580.0x169ff50"></a>Price</h2></div></div><p>Pricing is very reasonable. A single-user license is included
with the Red Hat Linux 4.x boxed set which sells for $49 US. A
general Linux version is $99 US, and all other platforms list for
$199 US. Metro-Link also offers Motif, OpenGL and Metro-Media at an
additional cost.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a7580.0x16a0058"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>If you are putting the product on a Red Hat Linux system,
installation is easy using the Red Hat Package Manager (RPM). Log
in as root and enter:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -i /path/to/Metroess.3.1.5-2.i386.rpm
</pre><p>To ensure that Linux uses Metro-X instead of the default
XFree86 server, the X11 link must be changed. Create the new link
using the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
ln -sf /usr/X11R6/bin/Xmetro /etc/X11/X
</pre>


Note that some systems put this link in /usr/X11R6/bin.
</p><p>Configuration is done through the Metro-X GUI (see Figure
1):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/bin/X11/configX
</pre><p>X11 will automatically load with the GUI as the foreground
process.
</p><p>The first drop-down box allows the user to select from
fourteen standard input devices. There is support for bus mice, PS2
mice, keyboard mice, track balls and several touch screens. And, of
course, it allows you to choose the button configuration, e.g., 1,
2, 3 or three button emulation.</p><p>The next drop-down box is for keyboard configuration. The
keyboard list is pretty impressive. There is support for most
languages and for my favorite, the Microsoft keyboard. Since I
spend so many hours at the computer, it's nice to have an ergonomic
model. I was surprised to see my Microsoft keyboard listed&mdash;it's a
non-standard item for a Unix system.</p><p><a href="2299t1.html" target="_self">Table: Supported Video
Cards</a></p><p>Next is the video card configuration. Metro supports thirty
six brands of video cards (see Table 1). For specific card
information visit the Metro Link web site at
http://www.metrolink.com/products/metrox/cardlist.table.html. They
have created a detailed table which lists supported color depths
and resolutions for each card. Most of the Diamond, Number Nine and
Video7 cards are listed. The support for Trident is a little weak;
only one of their cards made it to the list (Trident 8900).</p><p>Color depth, frequency, virtual resolution and physical
resolution are set by the click of a button. Depending on the card,
color depths from 16 to 16M can be chosen, as well as virtual and
physical resolution range from 640 x 480 to an impressive 1600 x
1200. The nice thing about the GUI configuration is you can quickly
change color depth and resolution depending on your application
needs. I have several programs, such as Applixware 4.2, that don't
work right above an 8 bit pallet. However, I like to do all my
graphics editing in true color. With Metro-X, I can change the
video configuration to match my applications in a matter of
seconds.</p><p>The <b  >Monitor</b> button displays a huge list of
common monitor types, and automatically creates the allowable
frequency range and synchronization. If your monitor isn't on the
list, don't worry&mdash;there are lots of generic monitor types to
choose from. You can even enter the exact screen size and select
the screensaver delay time. If you have a energy star monitor, you
can set standby, suspend and monitor off.</p><p>When everything is set up the way you want it, save the
configuration file and exit.</p><p>Log in as a regular user and start the X server:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/bin/startx
</pre><p>If you need to change the color depth or resolution, simply
rerun <b  >configX</b> while logged in as
<b  >root</b>. Make the necessary adjustments then log
back in to X Windows.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a7580.0x16a0840"></a>Enhancements</h2></div></div><p>One of the more intriguing features of Metro-X is
multi-screen support. If you use Metro-X MGA video cards, four
monitors can be operated simultaneously (see Figure 2).
Applications can be loaded into their own screens and controlled by
a single mouse and keyboard. A GUI based utility is provided to
handle the physical screen layout and mouse movement (see Figure
3). I would love to play around with this configuration, but my
wallet won't cooperate.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2299f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Monitor Configuration Screen
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2299f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Screen Layout GUI
</p></div></div><p>As with most modern X servers, multiple screens and virtual
resolution are supported. I cringe whenever I have to work on a
system that doesn't allow these features. I normally work in
several applications at once, and trying to cram multiple windows
into a single screen is a nightmare.</p><p>There is also the fail-safe escape method. If the X server
freezes or your mouse becomes disabled, Metro-X can be brought down
by pressing the ctrl, alt and backspace keys simultaneously. This
is a lot quicker than pressing ctrl-alt-f1 to get a virtual
console, then killing the X Server process.</p><p>If you're into video capture, MPEG playback or video
conferencing, Metro Link sells a video suite called Metro-Media.
The application runs on Metro-X with Motif and can be used by
developers and end users.</p><p>For developers and end users who use Motif-based
applications, Metro Link also supplies Motif 2.0 at $199US.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a7580.0x16976a8"></a>Performance</h2></div></div><p>I immediately noticed a performance increase when Metro-X was
installed on my system. It seems to be a very stable environment.
Several programs that misbehaved under XFree ran great with
Metro-X. Before Metro-X, Netscape was continually giving me
trouble&mdash;now, it runs like champ.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a7580.0x16977b0"></a>Support</h2></div></div><p>Support options are dependent on where you purchased the
package. If you received it from Red Hat, Red Hat provides the
support. Red Hat offers on-line support at http://www.redhat.com/
and phone support at 1-800-546-7274.</p><p>If the purchase was made directly from Metro Link, they
provide support through e-mail at tech@metrolink.com and phone
support at 1-954-938-0283.</p><p>I have yet to encounter a problem that required a tech
request, so I can't speak to the quality of support.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15a7580.0x1697968"></a>Overall impression</h2></div></div><p>With the ease of configuration, stability, available options
and enhancements, I think Metro-X is a real bargain. I recommend it
highly to anyone who wants to spend his time producing instead of
configuring.</p></div></div>
