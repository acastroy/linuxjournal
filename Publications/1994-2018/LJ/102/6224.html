I'm pretty fanatical about security. In this issue, you're going to
read about system and network security, but I want to provide you
the gospel according to David. I don't have the luxury of being
able to sit in a nice quiet office and contemplate security, I'm
just expected to implement something for my customers so they're as
protected as they can be without spending a lot of money. My recipe
is fairly short and simple, but the bottom line is to make wannabe
black hats go where the pickins are easier.
</p><p>First, shut off all non-essential network services (starting
with inetd if nothing started by inetd is required). Verify using
<b  >netstat -tupan</b>. Make very restrictive
/etc/hosts.allow rules (verify using <b  >tcpdchk</b> and
<b  >tcpdmatch</b>), and make judicious use of
Netfilter's state table, denying anything not specifically
permitted.</p><p>Ensure all programs providing network services (Apache,
sendmail, wu-ftpd, sshd, etc.), if on, are updated the day the
updates are available. And, review log files daily for anomalies
(use available programs to cull out routine messages). Logs ideally
should be written to a very secure central log server.</p><p>Make sure user passwords are secure passwords. Ensure the
public is routed through the firewall only to the untrusted LAN,
and permit no direct access from the Internet into the trusted LAN.
Use VPNs (FreeS/WAN, OpenSSH), and encrypt everything possible that
will travel over the wire (FreeS/WAN, OpenSSH, GnuPG).</p><p>Never attribute to malice that which can be attributed to
ignorance. Your users will never cease to amaze you with how little
they know or how much their stumbling around in the dark will look
like an attack. It probably isn't.</p><p>The above recipe will help, but it does nothing without this
final ingredient: security is an attitude, not a set of programs or
user restrictions. Set the example, and help users practice good
security procedures. They can be your greatest asset or worst
nightmare. If you practice the above religiously, you should not be
the victim of a break-in. But if that should happen, unplug from
the network, determine how the attacker got in (and what the intent
was), then reload the system, recheck all patches, close the door
so the attacker can't come back (if possible) and get back on-line.
Reporting to the authorities is good, but not a priority unless the
powers that be decide to pursue to prosecute and are willing to
pay.</p><p>ProBIND
<a href="http://probind.sourceforge.net" target="_self">probind.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>I'm always looking for better ways to handle DNS
administration, and ProBIND does a good job, although the security
area is lacking if you have multiple users updating only their DNS
servers. It works extremely well if either the users are all
trusted or only one person is updating many zones. (Or perhaps I
missed something.) Another drawback is the requirement to have the
PHP CGI module (the standalone interpreter). But if you have a lot
of DNS zones to handle, I'd look closely at this application.
Requires: MySQL, PHP with MySQL (both as a module and as a
standalone interpreter), Apache, Perl, Perl module Net::DNS,
OpenSSH (optional).</p><p>Tux Paint
<a href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint" target="_self">www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint</a></p><p>My kids love to play with the computers in the house. At four
years old, both my daughters were logging in, playing games, even
surfing the Web (<a href="http://barbie.com" target="_self">barbie.com</a>
and
<a href="http://cartoonnetwork.com" target="_self">cartoonnetwork.com</a>
have some great kids games). But they love to be creative and that
means painting programs. When I want to see how good a program of
this type is, I show my kids and let them go at it. If they're
asking for it the next time they log in, I've got a winner.
Requires: libSDL, libpthread, libSDL_image, libSDL_ttf,
libSDL_mixer, libm, libesd (optional), libdl, libartsc, libX11,
libXext, libjpeg, libpng, libz, libtiff, libfreetype,
libvorbisfile, libvorbis, libogg, libsmpeg, glibc.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6224f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>hdup
<a href="http://www.miek.nl/projects/hdup/hdup.shtml" target="_self">www.miek.nl/projects/hdup/hdup.shtml</a></p><p>Need to make some nonproprietary backups of your system on a
regular basis? How about copying that backup to another system? And
perhaps encrypting the backup as well? Easily done. Define the
particular backup type in a config file, then call it as a monthly,
weekly or daily (full or incremental) job. Requires: glibc, bash,
openssh, mcrypt (optional).</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Nebula Cards</em></span>
<a href="http://nebulacards.sourceforge.net" target="_self">nebulacards.sourceforge.net</a></p><p>Anyone for a game of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Spades</em></span>? Play
against humans and fill in the open seats with computer players.
Other four-player games should be implemented easily
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>Hearts</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bridge</em></span>, etc.).
You even can provide a web interface via an applet. Requires:
Java.</p><p>User-Friendly IPTables Firewall
<a href="http://lug.mfh-iserlohn.de/uif" target="_self">lug.mfh-iserlohn.de/uif</a></p><p>If you have problems creating iptables rules, you might want
to check out UIF. Although UIF doesn't actually create rules for
you, it can help you create your own. The configuration file of UIF
is less complicated than the iptables rules, so you create the
configuration file, and then UIF builds rules according to its
slightly more understandable syntax. Let UIF remember whether a
chain or target is capitalized. This program also handles stateful
connections. Requires: Perl, Perl modules NetAddr::IP, Net::LDAP
and, of course, iptables.</p><p>Linux Monitor
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-mon" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/linux-mon</a></p><p>This utility is a good way to keep an eye on critical parts
of a system. If it finds that a disk partition is too full or a
service isn't running, it will make an entry in the syslog. Linux
Monitor also can run a program; you set the time interval, and
linux_mon watches. This program can be particularly effective for a
large number of systems reporting to a central logger. Requires:
libcrypto, libdl, glibc.</p><p>Downloader for X
<a href="http://www.krasu.ru/soft/chuchelo" target="_self">www.krasu.ru/soft/chuchelo</a></p><p>This month's pick from three years ago wasn't easy. It had to
come from entries such as Geneweb and PortSentry, all of which I
still use. I finally chose Downloader for X, which allows you to
schedule downloads to start at a later time. You also can limit
download speeds dynamically. These small features make this utility
an excellent one, particularly if you have limited bandwidth. You
also can download FTP or HTTP sites or files. Its one limitation is
that it only runs in X (though few users would consider that a
limitation). Requires: libpthread, libglib, libgtk, libgdk,
libgmodule, libdl, libXext, libX11, libgdk_pixbuf, libstdc++, libm,
glibc. Until next month.</p></div></div>
