the dot-com era, back when you could get financing for a company
that did almost anything. At the beginning of that period, when the
Internet was becoming a mainstream medium, there was a lot of talk
about on-line communities. These sorts of communities weren't new
to internet veterans, who had been participating in Usenet long
before the Web appeared on the scene. But they looked like an
excellent opportunity to the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs,
who saw on-line communities as a potentially huge market.
</p><p>As was the case with many such ideas, everything was great
except for the business model. Many thousands of on-line
communities exist today, all of which make it possible for people
from around the world to share information and ideas on a topic.
Although few sites have managed to build businesses around such
communities, there is no doubt that such software is a vital part
of today's web infrastructure.</p><p>Creating an on-line community using a relational database and
a programming language is not difficult&mdash;but creating your tenth
web/database user-management system in as many months is annoying
for the developer and expensive for clients. Moreover, what happens
when a site wants to add new functionality? It would be nice if the
new features and fixed bugs could be reflected in all of your
sites, rather than only the one on which you made the
changes.</p><p>Philip Greenspun, author of the wonderful <span   class="emphasis"><em>Philip
and Alex's Guide to Web Publishing</em></span>, realized all of this
back in the mid-1990s, when marrying the Web and databases was
still a relatively new idea. His solution was to create a set of
applications that took into account the needs of as many on-line
communities as possible. The software toolkit he created formed the
basis of his doctoral thesis at MIT. It was also the basis for
ArsDigita, the web consulting company he founded. When the
ArsDigita Community System (ACS) was finally released, Greenspun
made it available under the GNU General Public License
(GPL).</p><p>Like many web consulting firms, ArsDigita never quite lived
up to its promise. After several years of meteoric success,
investors were brought in to expand the company further. Greenspun
was forced out; the company released two half-baked versions of ACS
(including one in Java that essentially rewrote the entire system);
most of the staff was laid off, and finally, Red Hat (which was
backed by the same investors as ArsDigita) hired a handful of
programmers and bought the company's few remaining assets.</p><p>If ArsDigita had been a proprietary software company, then
this would have been the end of the story. But because ACS was
licensed under the GPL, the community took over where the company
left off. More significantly, the community already had been
working on a version of ACS, known as OpenACS, that would use the
PostgreSQL relational database rather than the ACS default, Oracle.
(This article assumes that you will want to use PostgreSQL; the
instructions are only slightly different if you wish to use
Oracle.)</p><p>OpenACS 4.5, as the first production release was labeled, was
released in June of this year. It was renamed the &ldquo;Open
Architecture Community System&rdquo; to reflect the fact that ArsDigita
is no more. But Greenspun's influence is profoundly felt in the
OpenACS community, and the wealth of code and documentation written
by ArsDigita employees have helped propel the project
forward.</p><p>This month, we begin an extended look at OpenACS, which is
one of the more powerful (if relatively unknown) open-source web
toolkits available today. In coming months, we will look at how to
install OpenACS, how to use its templating system to create dynamic
pages and how to create sophisticated on-line communities with
limited code and administration.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd21580.0xe197c0"></a>What Is OpenACS?</h2></div></div><p>It's easy to say that OpenACS is a toolkit for creating
on-line communities. But what does that mean? For starters, it
means that OpenACS comes with working versions of most of the
applications you're likely to want on a community web site. It
handles user registration and administration, forums, FAQs, groups
(including a rich permission scheme), news updates, file storage
and distribution, personal home pages, surveys and a web-based
calendar. As you might expect from a modern system, administration
of the applications is done almost completely through the Web, with
only a few configuration files.</p><p>An experienced developer probably could write some or all of
these applications within a few weeks or months. But why reinvent
the wheel? Moreover, OpenACS is built on collective experience
gained from building such communities, which is reflected in the
sophistication of the data model and applications.</p><p>From a developer's perspective, OpenACS provides a database
designed for the creation of new, integrated applications. This
data model actually is the most important part of OpenACS. Although
you could rewrite the software for another database (as has been
done with PostgreSQL) and even use a language other than the
default Tcl, the data model is where most of the system's smarts
lie. OpenACS provides Tcl and Pl/PgSQL procedures that make it easy
to work with the data model.</p><p>Because OpenACS relies so heavily on a relational database,
it is important that access to the database be efficient and
flexible. For this reason, OpenACS installations almost always use
AOLserver (introduced in last month's installment of At the Forge),
instead of the more popular Apache. Because AOLserver uses multiple
threads inside of a single server process, it can provide a shared
pool of database connections. (Although there is fairly strong
allegiance to AOLserver within the OpenACS community, I would not
be surprised if the introduction of multithreading Apache 2.0
eventually leads the project in that direction.) And while
AOLserver provides its own database API, OpenACS provides a number
of higher-level procedures that make it extremely easy to work with
a database.</p><p>If you plan to work with only a single brand of database,
then you can use these procedures directly inside your Tcl programs
to store and retrieve information. But to ensure that all
applications will work on all platforms, OpenACS encourages
developers to place all of their database queries inside specially
formatted XML files (with an .xql extension), with each file
corresponding to a single database. When a Tcl program invokes a
procedure to send a query to the database, the OpenACS &ldquo;query
dispatcher&rdquo; opens the XML file for the currently configured
database, reads the query and sends it to the database. An OpenACS
system written in this way should be able to switch from PostgreSQL
to Oracle merely by changing the top-level configuration
file,</p><p>As we saw last month, AOLserver comes with its own templating
system, known as ADP, that makes it easy to mix server-side
programs with static HTML on a single page. Of course, this means
that designers and programmers often are fighting for control of a
single file, so designers must know which sections of a page to
avoid. OpenACS thus includes a new, more advanced templating system
that breaks each page into two parts: a Tcl page that sets
variables and an ADP page that retrieves those variable values.
This approach is similar in some ways to Zope Page Templates (ZPT)
and Enhydra's XMLC.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd21580.0xe19a80"></a>Design</h2></div></div><p>OpenACS may sound extremely complex, but it actually consists
of only four parts: 1) an installed PostgreSQL or Oracle server; 2)
AOLserver, compiled with nsxml (the XML-parsing module for
AOLserver), the PostgreSQL and/or Oracle driver and an appropriate
configuration file; 3) the OpenACS data model; and 4) OpenACS Tcl
libraries, Tcl pages and ADP pages.</p><p>Until version 4.x, installing OpenACS was straightforward.
You installed PostgreSQL and AOLserver, loaded the OpenACS data
model using the psql command-line client, copied the OpenACS
libraries, Tcl pages and ADP pages into the appropriate directory
and began to use the system.</p><p>But this approach led to a number of problems, most of which
stemmed from the installation's inflexibility. What if I want
forums under two different URLs, rather than the default /bboard?
What if I want to install only two or three packages, rather than
all 40? What if I want to upgrade the e-commerce solution, without
also upgrading the FAQ system?</p><p>The solution to this problem is the ArsDigita Package
Manager, introduced in ArsDigita's ACS 4.x and adopted by OpenACS
4.x. Each application has been renamed a &ldquo;package&rdquo; and consists
of a data model, .xql files, Tcl libraries, Tcl pages and ADP
pages, as well as documentation. Each package can be installed at
any number of URLs on the system and can have arbitrary permissions
associated with it (using the system of users and groups that are
central to OpenACS). Each package also may define one or more
parameters, giving custom information each time it is
instantiated.</p><p>If you install OpenACS in /web/openacs4, then the www
directory contains all of the top-level Tcl and ADP pages, the tcl
directory contains the top-level Tcl libraries, and the packages
directory contains each of the packages loaded onto the
system.</p><p>Once a package is in the filesystem, you can use the OpenACS
web-based installer program to create the package-specific data
model in the database. Finally, the site administrator makes the
package available by mounting it (one or more times) via the
administrative site map. Once mounted, an application is available
via the named URL.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd21580.0xe19d40"></a>Installing OpenACS</h2></div></div><p>Now that I've explained much of the theory behind OpenACS,
we're ready to install it. Note that installation is relatively
complex, because it involves a number of packages that must be
installed with particular ownerships and permissions. The OpenACS
4.5 installation process is smoother and easier than previous
versions, but it is still surprisingly easy to make a mistake along
the way.</p><p>Before beginning, make sure that PostgreSQL 7.1.3 is
installed, including the server, client and development libraries.
The newest version of PostgreSQL (7.2) has a few subtle
incompatibilities with older versions that can make it difficult to
install OpenACS. While there are certainly a number of improvements
in 7.2, you should be fine using 7.1.3.</p><p>Also, make sure you have installed libxml 2.x; on Red Hat
systems, you should make sure the libxml2 and libxml2-devel RPMs
are both installed. Without these, OpenACS won't be able to open
the .info package associated with each file, as well as the .xql
files used by the query dispatcher.</p><p>Next, install AOLserver, ensuring that /usr/local/aolserver
is owned by the nsadmin user:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /usr/local/aolserver
# useradd nsadmin
# chown -R nsadmin /usr/local/aolserver
</pre><p>Rather than installing the stock version of AOLserver,
applying the patches that ArsDigita and the OpenACS crew have
written over the years and separately downloading the PostgreSQL
and XML-parsing modules, you should download the all-in-one version
known as &ldquo;Matt's AOLserver distribution&rdquo; (see Resources).
</p><p>Next, create a PostgreSQL user named openacs4, giving it full
privileges. (PostgreSQL has its own list of users that is
independent of the UNIX list.) In general, such activities must be
performed as the postgres user, rather than as root:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# su postgres
# createuser openacs4
  Shall the new user be allowed to create
    databases? (y/n) y
  Shall the new user be allowed to create
    more new users? (y/n) y
  CREATE USER
</pre><p>Now, use this new PostgreSQL user to create a new database,
which we will call openacs4:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# createdb -U openacs4 openacs4
  CREATE DATABASE
</pre>


Following this, install the OpenACS package itself while logged in
as the root user. You can download the latest release
(openacs-4-5-release.tgz) from
<a href="http://openacs.org" target="_self">openacs.org</a>. Traditionally,
this package is unpacked under the /web hierarchy:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /web
# cd /web
# tar -zxvf /tmp/openacs-4-5-release.tgz
# mv /web/openacs-4 /web/openacs4
# chown -R nsadmin.nsadmin /web
</pre>


With the completion of this step, all of the major pieces are in
place. What remains is to tie all of these pieces together in the
AOLserver configuration file. The easiest starting point for this
is to download the file openacs4.tcl.txt from
<a href="http://openacs.org" target="_self">openacs.org</a>, rename it
openacs4.tcl, place it in /usr/local/aolserver and edit it in the
following ways:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Modify the httpport to reflect the port on which
you want the server to run. By default, HTTP servers run on port
80; in the sample configuration, it is set to 8000.</p></li><li><p>Modify the hostname and address settings (lines 14
and 15) to the actual hostname and IP address of the computer on
which you want to run your system. In theory, the Tcl code in
openacs4.tcl will find your hostname and IP address automatically.
But if your computer has more than one name or IP address, or if
you want to use localhost as the hostname for testing, then you
will have to set this manually.</p></li><li><p>Change line 17 to the name of the server and
database you wish to use, which should be the name of the directory
within /web where the OpenACS software is installed. Thus, if you
put the OpenACS software under /web/foo, you should also name your
database foo. The server variable on line 17 also should be set to
foo.</p></li><li><p>Change line 18 to reflect the human-readable name
of the on-line community you wish to create.</p></li><li><p>On each of the lines where you see
<b  >ns_param user nsadmin</b> change the value (nsadmin)
to <b  >openacs4</b>, the name of the PostgreSQL user
that created the database. You must do this for all three of the
database connection pools AOLserver opens to PostgreSQL, known as
main, log and subquery.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>Once you have made these changes, you should be ready to
start the system. As root, start the server in foreground
mode:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /usr/local/aolserver
# ./bin/nsd -f -u nsadmin -g nsadmin \
  -t openacs4.tcl
</pre><p>You should see a lot of debugging information on your screen,
scrolling by faster than you can possibly read. When the scrolling
stops, you should see something toward the end that looks like
this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
[22/Jul/2002:15:13:41][23316.1024][-main-]
  Notice: nssock: listening on 127.0.0.1:8000
[22/Jul/2002:15:13:41][23316.8201][-nssock-]
  Notice: nssock: starting
[22/Jul/2002:15:13:41][23316.8201][-nssock-]
  Notice: nssock: accepting connections
</pre>


If you do, point your web browser to http://localhost:8000/. If all
is well, you should see a welcome message from the OpenACS
installer. Now, follow the directions to create the system,
clicking the next button at the bottom as it appears. Note that the
installation process may take awhile, because the installer creates
a large number of database tables. Toward the end of the
installation process, you will be asked for the e-mail address of
the OpenACS administrator, as well as other system parameters.
</p><p>The final page welcomes you to OpenACS and informs you that
AOLserver has been terminated. (This is necessary, so as to load
all of the newly installed Tcl library files into AOLserver's
memory.) Restart the server, point your browser at
http://localhost:8000/ once again, and OpenACS will be ready and
waiting for you.</p><p>At this point, OpenACS is fully functional, but given that
none of the packages have been installed, it won't do very much for
you. In next month's At the Forge, we'll take a look at how to
install and manage OpenACS packages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd21580.0xe1a8f0"></a>Is OpenACS Worth Your Time?</h2></div></div><p>There's no getting around it: OpenACS is a complex beast.
Although the software is generally excellent, it requires an
experienced UNIX/web/database hacker to use and modify it. Even the
installation procedure is long and complicated, and I can assure
you from personal experience that it's often hard to understand
where you have made a mistake. The documentation is improving, but
there are many gaping holes and difficult-to-understand table
structures that can be confusing.</p><p>As if that weren't enough, the code isn't completely finished
in many places. Yes, the fact that OpenACS is open source does mean
you can fix things yourselves. And the community is generally quite
open and generous, giving help to those who are trying to get
started with it. But it's frustrating to hear constantly that the
packages you need are almost ready or that someone expects to
finish with them at some point in the future. I'm not averse to
helping improve open-source projects, especially when it benefits
me (and my clients) directly, but many small annoyances can add up
quickly.</p><p>Given these complaints, it might seem absurd to think that I
endorse OpenACS at all. And indeed, it probably will take some time
for the dust to settle and for all of the necessary improvements to
be made. But there's no getting around the fact that OpenACS
provides a much richer infrastructure for creating on-line
communities than anything else I've seen. The included applications
might not work completely, but they work pretty darned well
overall, and provide most of the functionality that my clients
need, right out of the box. Finally, a number of commercial
consulting companies, several universities and one or two dozen
independent consultants are working on improvements and extensions
to OpenACS that promise to make it more robust and featurefull than
it is today.</p><p>If you're creating an on-line community, and you're not
afraid to get your hands dirty with Tcl and SQL code, then you
should take a serious look at OpenACS. This month, we considered
the overall structure of OpenACS and saw how to install its various
elements. Next month, we'll look at how to install and manage the
various packages that come with OpenACS, so that we can put
together a custom community site that includes only those programs
that we really need.</p><p><a href="6223s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
