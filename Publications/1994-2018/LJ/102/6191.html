Factory?</h2></div></div><p>Having just bought an IBM ThinkPad (great piece of hardware),
declined the license agreement and installed Linux, I thought you
might be interested to hear of my ongoing communication with IBM on
this subject. Here's an excerpt from their first e-mail:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Our legal department has provided the following
response: &ldquo;IBM does not sell its notebook or desktop personal
computers without an operating system. Today, all IBM personal
computers are preloaded with a Microsoft Windows operating system.
From time to time, we also have offered certain ThinkPad notebooks
with the Linux operating system. All of IBM's personal computers
ship as a complete system. IBM does not accept the return of
individual software items separate from the system. We will,
however, accept return of the entire system within 30 days of
purchase for a full refund.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>This fight continues to be a burden to us all, and I'd be
interested in any upcoming revival of Windows Refund Day. It's not
the money, it's the principle involved.
</p><p>&mdash;Alan Wardroper</p><p>IBM's ThinkPad and legal departments must not have been on
the list for Lou Gerstner's &ldquo;we support Linux&rdquo; memo. Somebody
send us an extra copy and we'll make sure they get it.</p><p>&mdash;Editor</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2111580.0x22093a0"></a>Read My Lips, You Will</h2></div></div><p>I found your article very interesting on how ILM works with
Linux. I was intrigued by the fact that they had a more
real-looking Yoda than George wanted (which made sense). However, I
was wondering if you could ask the guys in your interview if they
could release a little video with the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span>-looking Yoda. I am curious as to how that
one would have looked.</p><p>&mdash;Kreg Steppe</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Robin Rowe replies:</b></span> Getting
pictures is often the most challenging part when researching movie
studio stories. Hollywood clears a limited number of stock images
for publicity. Writers don't usually get a choice of what pictures
they will receive. I'm fortunate to receive the cooperation of the
studios for Linux screenshots, but don't get everything I ask
for.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2111580.0x2209608"></a>Vendors Can Help Sponsor Projects</h2></div></div><p>I am an avid shooter and compete in a number of shooting
competitions. One thing that a number of the shooting supplies
vendors do when you place an order is ask if it is okay to add
$1.00 to your order for a contribution to the NRA. Millions of
dollars are contributed to the NRA this way. Many Linux and
open-source projects and programs could really use funding
assistance. I thought the same sort of program could be used to
assist these programs and projects. Perhaps each of the vendors in
Linux could &ldquo;adopt&rdquo; a project and collect for that specifically.
Perhaps the buyer could be given a choice, or the funds could go
into a common pot and be doled out as needed. I know I would not
have a problem if your folks asked me for $1.00 when I renewed my
subscription or bought something from ThinkGeek, SuSE or
Mandrake.</p><p>&mdash;Jim Krebs</p><p>Some vendors already do
this&mdash;<a href="http://linux-cd.com" target="_self">linux-cd.com</a> will

Cinelerra replaces Broadcast2000. You can find that at
<a href="http://heroinewarrior.com/cinelerra.php3" target="_self">heroinewarrior.com/cinelerra.php3</a>.
Getting Cinelerra support can be difficult, but LMA

Cinelerra with purchase of its editing workstations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2111580.0x2209b88"></a>Turn That Thing Down!</h2></div></div><p>As an aging 37-year-old rock musician and IT administrator,
I'm finding it more and more painful working around the
increasingly loud forest of fans, hard drives, etc. Even the whine
of the hard drive in my Mac Cube bothered me enough to dump it. I
would absolutely love to see an article on how we with sensitive
eardrums could build the &ldquo;Ultimate Silent Home Linux Box&rdquo;. Anyone
up for the task?</p><p>&mdash;Dave Scarbrough</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2111580.0x2209ce8"></a>maddog's Story of LI's Founding</h2></div></div><p>I would like to thank you for the mentions of some of the
things that LI has done for the Linux community over the years in
the calendar of your 100th issue. However, both in your calendar
and in the quote from me on page 22, you had me listed as the
&ldquo;Founder of Linux International&rdquo;. That honor goes to Patrick
D'Cruze, of Australia. Patrick came up with the idea that Linux
needed an organization that thought about the business side of
Linux. He helped with deciphering the GPL, protecting the trademark
&ldquo;Linux&rdquo;, organizing tradeshows and formed Linux
International.</p><p>However, he also recognized that it would be harder to start
the organization from Australia, so he contacted a couple of
companies in the US, and basically transferred the incorporation to
the US. In September 1995, Alan Fedder, of Uniforum, accepted the
voluntary position of Executive Director of Linux
International.</p><p>I joined the Board of Directors of LI in November 1995 as the
representative of Digital Equipment Corporation. At that time we
had several other companies on board, including <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>In May 1996, Alan had to devote more of his time to his paid
positions and stepped down from the executive directorship,
although he was kind enough to remain the treasurer. The members
decided that I would fill the still-volunteer position. I have been
in that position ever since.</p><p>&mdash;maddog</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2111580.0x2209fa8"></a>Oh Boy! A Penguin This Month Too!</h2></div></div><p>Just wanted to contact someone at <i  >Linux Journal</i> and say, hey, this is a really neat idea to send
a Linux calendar. Way cool!!</p><p>&mdash;Valden Longhurst</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2111580.0x220a160"></a>dd if=soap of=/dev/mouth</h2></div></div><p>Before this gets started the wrong way, I must say that I
enjoy <i  >Linux Journal</i> very much and usually read
it cover to cover. I do wish to complain, however, about the RAV ad
on page 125 of this month's (August 2002) <i  >LJ</i>.
Language of that type is inappropriate in such a fine publication
as yours. I still enjoy the magazine, and I know that you get paid
in great part by the advertisers, but I would ask that you be,
perhaps, a little more picky in your choice of ads.</p><p>&mdash;Keith Sutton</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2111580.0x220a370"></a>Free Software Survives Nasdaq Plunge</h2></div></div><p>In 1998 the Gartner Group says: &ldquo;There's little hope for
free software&rdquo; (<i  >Linux Journal</i> 100, page 73).
But if you look today from the perspective of a Nasdaq at below
1,300, when software companies cut staff, it's great to see that
innovation still happens on a daily basis in a whole host of
open-source projects such as Linux, Apache and Jakarta. These
probably are the seeds of some future success stories.</p><p>&mdash;Boris Debic</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2111580.0x220a528"></a>Mmm, Meat</h2></div></div><p>In your recent Linux Timeline [August 2002 issue of
<i  >LJ</i>], you mention VA Linux Systems purchase of
Andover.net, &ldquo;...owner of the popular web sites Slashdot.org and
Freshmeat.org....&rdquo; The correct site is Freshmeat.net.
Freshmeat.org now appears to be unpopulated. At one time, it was
host of a site of quite a different sort.</p><p>&mdash;Daniel D. Jones</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2111580.0x220a6e0"></a>Router Review Is Bogus</h2></div></div><p>One would think that a product review that took four people
to write it would be pretty good, however, that's not the case in
your August 2002, 100th issue article titled &ldquo;The Linux Router&rdquo;
on page 121. Your authors would have done much better by stating
the actual throughput numbers of the Cisco alongside their price
and let the reader decide which route (and router) they wanted to
take.</p><p>The writers admit that (on page 122 and 123) only one set of
their numbers is correct. It states that &ldquo;The measurements for the
Pentium I are misleading, as the bottleneck is the 90Mbps practical
limit of 100Base-T Ethernet...&rdquo; and &ldquo;The bandwidth of the
PIII-based Linux router cannot be calculated...&rdquo; It sounds to me
that this test is totally bogus and should have been conducted with
an actual internet speed connection, with network cards capable of
handling speeds that Cisco routers operate in, should have given
the Cisco router bandwidth numbers and should have been done by a
team that has done product reviews before and is not still in
college.</p><p>&mdash;Wayne</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2111580.0x220a898"></a>Errata</h2></div></div><p><i  >LJ</i>, August 2002, &ldquo;How a Poor Contract
