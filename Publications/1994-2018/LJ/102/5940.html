developing a PAM-enabled application and writing the PAM
configuration file.</p><p>by Savio Fernandes and KLM Reddy</p><p>
Authentication is a mechanism that verifies whether an entity is
who it claims to be. On a Linux system, applications, such as su,
passwd or login, are used to authenticate users before they are
given access to the system's resources.</p><p>On almost all Linux distributions, user information is stored
in /etc/passwd. This is a text file that contains the user's login,
the encrypted password, a unique numerical user ID (called the
uid), a numerical group ID (called the gid), an optional comment
field (usually containing such items as the user's real name, phone
number, etc.), the home directory and the preferred shell. A
typical entry in /etc/passwd looks something like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
aztec:K52xi345vMO:900:900:Aztec
software,Bangalore:/home/aztec:/bin/bash
</pre><p>In reality, though, if you look at your /etc/passwd, it's
likely that you actually see something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
aztec:x:900:900:Aztec
software,Bangalore:/home/aztec:/bin/bash
</pre>


Where did the encrypted password go?
</p><p>The /etc/passwd file is readable by all users, making it
possible for any user to get the encrypted passwords of everyone on
the system. Though the passwords are encrypted, password-cracking
programs are widely available. To combat this growing security
threat, shadow passwords were developed.</p><p>When a system has shadow passwords enabled, the password
field in /etc/passwd is replaced by an &ldquo;x&rdquo;, and the user's real
encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow. Because /etc/shadow is
only readable by the root user, malicious users cannot crack their
fellow users' passwords. Each entry in /etc/shadow contains the
user's login, their encrypted password and a number of fields
relating to password expiration. A typical entry looks like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
aztec:/3GJajkg1o4125:11009:0:99999:7:::
</pre><p>In the initial days of Linux, when an application needed to
authenticate a user, it simply would read the necessary information
from /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow. If it needed to change the user's
password, it simply would edit /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.
</p><p>This method, though simple, is a bit clumsy and presents
numerous problems for system administrators and application
developers. Each application requiring user authentication has to
know how to get the proper information when dealing with a number
of different authentication schemes. Thus the development of the
privilege-granting application software is linked tightly to the
authentication scheme. Also, as new authentication schemes emerge,
the old ones become obsolete. In other words, if a system
administrator wants to change the authentication scheme, the entire
application must be recompiled.</p><p>To overcome these shortcomings, we need to come up with a
flexible architecture that separates the development of
privilege-granting software from the development of secure and
appropriate authentication schemes. The Linux Pluggable
Authentication Module (PAM) is such an architecture, and it
successfully eliminates the tight coupling between the
authentication scheme and the application.</p><p>From the perspective of the application programmer, PAM takes
care of this authentication task and verifies the identity of the
user. From the perspective of the system administrator, there is
the freedom to stipulate which authentication scheme is used for
any PAM-aware application on a Linux system.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="5940f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The PAM Ecosystem
</p></div></div><p>Figure 1 shows the four major components of the PAM
Ecosystem. The first component is the PAM Library, which provides
the necessary interface and functions required for developing
PAM-aware applications and modules.</p><p>Second is the PAM-Enabled Application, an application that
provides some service. It also may need to authenticate the user
before granting service. To perform the authentication step, the
application interfaces with the Linux-PAM library and invokes
whatever authentication services it requires. The application knows
none of the specifics of the configured authentication method. The
application is required to provide a &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; function,
which allows the loaded authentication module to communicate
directly with the application and vice versa.</p><p>The Pluggable Authentication Module is the third component
and is a binary that provides support for some (arbitrary)
authentication method. When loaded, modules can communicate
directly with the application, through the application-provided
&ldquo;conversation&rdquo; function. Textual information, required from (or
offered to) the user, can be exchanged through the use of the
application-supplied &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; function.</p><p>The final component is the PAM Configuration File. It is a
text file where the system administrator can specify which
authentication scheme is used for a particular application. On the
Linux system, this configuration information can be stored either
in a file under the /etc/pam.d folder or as a line in the /etc/conf
configuration file. The PAM configuration file is read when the
application initializes the PAM library. The PAM library then loads
the corresponding authentication modules configured to support the
authentication scheme specified for a particular module.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1441580.0x153a058"></a>Developing a Linux PAM-Enabled
Application</h2></div></div><p>To PAM-enable an application, we need to invoke the
appropriate authentication routines in the PAM library. We also
need to provide a &ldquo;conversation function&rdquo; that the module can use
to communicate directly with the application.</p><p>The authentication routines of the PAM API consist of the
following three primary functions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>pam_start(): the first of the PAM functions that
must be called by an application. It initializes the PAM library,
reads the PAM configuration file and loads the desired
authentication modules in the order in which they are mentioned in
the configuration file. It returns a handle to the PAM library that
the application can make use of for all further interactions with
the library.</p></li><li><p>pam_end(): the last function an application should
call in the PAM library. Upon its return, the handle to the PAM
library is no longer valid, and all memory associated with it will
be invalidated.</p></li><li><p>pam_authenticate(): this function serves as an
interface to the authentication mechanisms of the loaded modules.
It is called by the application when it needs to authenticate a
user who is requesting service.</p></li></ol></div><p>In addition to the authentication routines, the PAM API also
provides the following functions, which the application can invoke:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>pam_acct_mgmt(): checks whether the current user's
account is valid.</p></li><li><p>pam_open_session(): begins a new session.</p></li><li><p>pam_close_session(): closes the current
session.</p></li><li><p>pam_setcred(): manages user credentials.</p></li><li><p>pam_chauthtok(): changes the user's authentication
token.</p></li><li><p>pam_set_item(): writes state information for the
PAM session.</p></li><li><p>pam_get_item(): retrieves state information for PAM
session.</p></li><li><p>pam_strerror(): returns an error string.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>These PAM API routines are made available to the application
by the security/pam_appl.h interface.</p><p>The conversation function facilitates direct communication
between a loaded module and the application. It typically provides
a means for the module to prompt the user for a user name, password
and so on. The signature of the conversation function, conv_func,
is as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int conv_func (int,const struct pam_message **,
                struct pam_response **,void *);
</pre><p>The loaded authentication module prompts the application for
some input via the pam_message structure. The application sends the
requested information to the module through the pam_response
structure.
</p><p>But, how does the module get a pointer to the conversation
function? The answer is the conversation structure: struct
pam_conv. The conversation structure needs to be initialized by the
application with the pointer to the conversation function. After
initialization, the conversation structure is passed as an argument
to the PAM library during the call to pam_start(). Using this
pointer, the module can then begin communication with the
conversation function.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1441580.0x153ac08"></a>Putting Them Together</h2></div></div><p>Now, let's develop an application that returns the current
time. This application is one that is required to authenticate the
user before providing service.</p><p>First, include the necessary headers. The header file
security/pam_appl.h is the interface to the PAM API. Then,
initialize the conversation structure:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static struct pam_conv conv = {
        my_conv,        //function pointer to the
                        //conversation function
        NULL
};
</pre><p>Then write the main() method. To do this, first load the PAM
library. We know that an application needs to call the methods in
the PAM library in order to delegate the required authentication
tasks. But how does the application get a handle to the PAM
library, libpam? A call to pam_start() initializes the libpam with
the service_name of the application requiring the authentication
service, the user name of the individual to be authenticated and a
pointer to the pam_conv structure. This function returns a handle
to the libpam, *pamh, that provides continuity for successive calls
to the PAM library:
<pre     class="programlisting">
pam_handle_t *pamh = NULL;
int retval = 0;
retval =  pam_start("check_user",NULL,&amp;conv,&amp;pamh);
if(retval != PAM_SUCCESS)
        exit(0);
</pre>


If we do not want to pass the user name to pam_start(), we can pass
NULL. The loaded authentication module then will prompt the user
for it at a later point in time with the conversation function.
</p><p>The second step in writing the main() method is to
authenticate the user. Now comes the moment of truth where we
decide whether the user is who he claims to be. How do we discover
this? The function pam_authenticate() serves as an interface to the
authentication mechanisms of the loaded modules. It verifies the
user name and password supplied by the user by interacting with the
appropriate authentication module. It returns PAM_SUCCESS on
success, and if there is no match, some error value indicating the
nature of failure is returned:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
retval = pam_authenticate(pamh,0);
if(retval == PAM_SUCCESS)
        printf("%s\n","Authenticated.");
else
        printf("%s\n","Authentication Failed.");
</pre><p>You may notice we pass the handle pamh, which we have
obtained from the earlier call to pam_start().
</p><p>The third step in this process is providing access to the
desired service. Now that the user is authenticated, he will be
provided with access to the requested service. As an example, our
service displays the current time:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
return current_time();
</pre><p>Finally, unload the PAM library. After the user has finished
using the application, the PAM library needs to be unloaded. Also,
the memory associated with the handle pamh needs to be invalidated.
We achieve this with a call to pam_end():
<pre     class="programlisting">
int pam_ status = 0; if(pam_end(pamh,pam_status) !=
PAM_SUCCESS) { pamh = NULL;
        exit(1);
}
</pre>


The value is taken by the second argument to pam_end(). pam_status
is used as an argument to the module-specific callback function,
cleanup(). In this way, the module can perform any last-minute
tasks that are appropriate to the module before it is unlinked. On
successful return of the function, all memory associated with the
handle pamh is released.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1441580.0x1531968"></a>Provide the Conversation Function</h2></div></div><p>The implementation of a basic conversation function is shown
in Listing 1.</p><p><a href="5940l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. A Basic Conversion
Function</a></p><p>The arguments of a call to the conversation function concern
the information exchanged by the module and the application. That
is, num_msg holds the length of the array of the pointer, msg.
After a successful return, the pointer *resp points to an array of
pam_response structures, holding the application-supplied
text.</p><p>The message-passing structure (from the module to the
application) is defined by security/pam_appl.h as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct pam_message {
    int msg_style;
    const char *msg;
};
</pre><p>The point of having an array of messages is that it becomes
possible to pass a number of things to the application in a single
call from the module. Valid choices for msg_style are:
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF: obtains a string without
echoing any text (e.g., password).</p></li><li><p>PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_ON: obtains a string while echoing
text (e.g., user name).</p></li><li><p>PAM_ERROR_MSG: displays an error.</p></li><li><p>PAM_TEXT_INFO: displays some text.</p></li></ul></div>

</p><p>The response-passing structure (from the application to the
module) is defined by including security/pam_appl.h as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct pam_response {
    char *resp; int resp_retcode;
};
</pre><p>Currently, there are no definitions for resp_retcode values;
the normal value is 0.

gcc -o azapp azapp.c -lpam -L/usr/azlibs
</pre><p>The folder /usr/azlibs should be the one that typically
contains the Linux-PAM library modules, which are libpam.so. This
library file contains the definitions for the functions that were
declared in pam_appl.h.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1441580.0x1532258"></a>Developing the Pluggable Authentication Module
(PAM)</h2></div></div><p>When faced with the task of developing a module, we first
need to be clear about the type of module we want to
implement.</p><p>Modules may be grouped into four independent management
types: authentication, account, session and password. To be
properly defined, a module must define all functions within at
least one of those four management groups.</p><p>Use the function pam_sm_authenticate() to implement an
authentication module, which does the actual authentication. Then
use pam_sm_setcred(). Generally, an authentication module may have
access to more information about a user than their authentication
token. This second function is used to make such information
available to the application. It should only be called after the
user has been authenticated but before a session has been
established.</p><p>For account management model implementation,
pam_sm_acct_mgmt() is the function that performs the task of
establishing whether the user is permitted to gain access at this
time. The user needs to be previously validated by an
authentication module before this step.</p><p>The session management module commences a session with a call
to pam_sm_open_session().</p><p>When a session needs to be terminated, the
pam_sm_close_session() function is called. It should be possible
for sessions to be opened by one application and closed by another.
This either requires that the module uses only information obtained
from pam_get_item() or that information regarding the session is
stored in some way by the operating system (in a file for
example).</p><p>Finally, pam_sm_chauthtok() implements the password
management module and is the function used to (re-)set the
authentication token of the user (change the user password). The
Linux-PAM library calls this function twice in succession. The
authentication token is changed only in the second call, after it
verifies that it matches the one previously entered.</p><p>In addition to these module functions, the PAM API also
provides the following functions, which the module can
invoke:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>pam_set_item(): writes state information for the
PAM session.</p></li><li><p>pam_get_item(): retrieves state information for the
PAM session.</p></li><li><p>pam_strerror(): returns an error string.</p></li></ul></div><p>The PAM API functions needed for module development are made
available to the module via the security/pam_modules.h
interface.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1441580.0x1532888"></a>Putting Them Together</h2></div></div><p>Now, let's develop a module that performs authentication
management. For this we need to implement the functions in the
authentication management group. Start by including the necessary
headers. The header file security/pam_modules.h is the interface to
the Linux-PAM library.</p><p>Next, authenticate the user; Listing 2 shows a basic
implementation of the pam_sm_authenticate(). The purpose of this
function is to prompt the application for a user name and password
and then authenticate the user against the password encryption
scheme.</p><p><a href="5940l2.html" target="_self">Listin2. A Basic Implementation of
pam_sm_authenticate()</a></p><p>Obtaining the user name is achieved via a call to
pam_get_user(), if the application hasn't already supplied the
password during a call to start_pam().</p><p>Once we get the user name, we need to prompt the user for his
authentication token (in this case the password) by calling
_read_password(). This method reads the user's password by
interacting with the application-provided conversation
function.</p><p>In _read_password() we first set the appropriate data in the
pam_message struct array to be able to interact with the
conversation function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct pam_message msg[3], *pmsg[3];
struct pam_response *resp;
int i, replies;
/* prepare to converse by setting appropriate */
/* data in the pam_message struct array */
pmsg[i] = &amp;msg[i];
msg[i].msg_style = PAM_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF;
msg[i++].msg = prompt1;
replies = 1;
</pre><p>Now call the conversation function expecting
<span   class="emphasis"><em>i</em></span> responses from the conversation function:
<pre     class="programlisting">
retval = converse(pamh, ctrl, i, pmsg, &amp;resp);
</pre>


The converse() function basically is a front end for the module to
the application-supplied conversation function.
</p><p>Finally, a call to _verify_password(). The _verify_password()
method essentially verifies the user's credentials according to the
appropriate cryptographic scheme.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1441580.0x1532d58"></a>Setting the User Credentials</h2></div></div><p>Generally, an authentication module may have access to more
information about a user than what is contained in their
authentication token. The pam_sm_setcred function is used to make
such information available to the application. A basic
implementation of the pam_sm_setcred is shown in Listing 3. In this
sample implementation of this function, we simply make available to
the application the return code of the call to
pam_sm_authenticate().</p><p><a href="5940l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. A Basic Implementation of
pam_sm_setcred</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1441580.0x1532f10"></a>Conversing with the Application</h2></div></div><p>The converse() function acts as a front end for
module-application conversations. A sample implementation of
converse() is shown in Listing 4.</p><p><a href="5940l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. A Sample Implementation
of converse()</a></p><p>The pointer to the conversation function is obtained using
pam_get_item(pamh,PAM_CONV,&amp;item). Using the pointer, the
module now can start communicating directly with the
application.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1441580.0x1533120"></a>Taking Care of Statically Loaded Modules</h2></div></div><p>Modules may be statically linked to libpam. In fact, this
should be true of all the modules distributed with the basic PAM
distribution. To be statically linked, a module needs to export
information about the functions it contains in a manner that does
not clash with other modules.</p><p>The extra code necessary to build a static module should be
delimited with <b  >#ifdef PAM_STATIC</b> and
<b  >#endif</b>. The static code should define a single
structure, struct pam_module. This is called
_pam_<span   class="emphasis"><em>modname</em></span>_modstruct, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>modname</em></span> is the name of the module used in the
filesystem, minus the leading directory name (generally
/usr/lib/security/) and the suffix (generally .so).</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef PAM_STATIC
struct pam_module _pam_unix_auth_modstruct = {
    "pam_unix_auth",
    pam_sm_authenticate,
    pam_sm_setcred,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL,
    NULL,
};
#endif
</pre><p>Now our module is ready to be compiled as static or dynamic.
Compile the module using the following command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -fPIC -c pam_module-name.c
ld -x --shared -o pam_module-name.so pam_module-name.o

File</h2></div></div><p>The local configuration of those aspects of system security
controlled by Linux-PAM is contained in one of two places, either
the single system file (/etc/pam.conf) or the /etc/pam.d/

the form: <span   class="emphasis"><em>service-name module-type control-flag

configuration file has the form: <span   class="emphasis"><em>module-type control-flag

<span   class="emphasis"><em>service-name</em></span> becomes the name of the

name of the given application, for example, azServer.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1441580.0x15337a8"></a>Module Type</h2></div></div><p>Four module types exist: auth, account, session and
password.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>auth: determines whether the user is who he claims
to be, usually done with a password, but may be determined by a
more sophisticated means, such as biometrics.</p></li><li><p>account: determines whether the user is allowed to
access the service, whether his passwords have expired and so
on.</p></li><li><p>password: provides a mechanism for the user to
change his authentication token. Again, this is usually his
password.</p></li><li><p>session: things that should be done before and/or
after the user is authenticated. This might include things such as
mounting/unmounting the user home directory, logging the
login/logout and restricting/unrestricting the services available
to the user.</p></li></ul></div><p>In addition, there are four control flags: required,
requisite, sufficient and optional.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Required: indicates that the success of the module
is required for the module-type facility to succeed. Failure of
this module will not be apparent to the user until all of the
remaining modules (of the same module type) have been
executed.</p></li><li><p>Requisite: same as required, except that in the
case of a module failure, it directly returns the result to the
application.</p></li><li><p>Sufficient: if this module has succeeded and all
previous required modules have succeeded, then no more subsequent
required modules are invoked.</p></li><li><p>Optional: marks the module as not critical to the
success or failure of the user's application for service. Its value
is taken into consideration only in the absence of any definite
successes or failures of previous or subsequent stacked
modules.</p></li></ul></div><p>The pathname of the dynamically loadable object file (the
pluggable module itself) is the module path. If the first character
of the module path is /, it is assumed to be a complete path. If
this is not the case, the given module path is appended to the
default module path, /usr/lib/security.</p><p>The arguments are a list of tokens passed to the module when
it is invoked, much like arguments to a typical Linux shell
command. Generally, valid arguments are optional and specific to
any given module.</p><p>Finally, to write the configuration file, edit the
/etc/pam.conf file to add the following line of code:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
check_user  auth  required  /lib/security/pam_unix.so
</pre><p>This indicates that for the service-names, check_user and
auth module-type are required. The module to be loaded to support
