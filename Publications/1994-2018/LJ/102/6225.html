air to be blown about haphazardly by the wind is not entirely
frivolous. The image is apt to describe the public domain. Software
engineers use the term &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; as if it means a place
where anyone can do anything they want with software. Public domain
software has no owner. Even the government doesn't own it. It is
simply &ldquo;free&rdquo;, as in the terms &ldquo;free beer&rdquo; and &ldquo;free speech&rdquo;.
</p><p>There <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> such a thing as the public
domain, however. In it one can find Bach's sonatas, Shakespeare's
plays, the drawings of da Vinci and the design of the Eiffel Tower.
These things literally are available for anyone and everyone to use
without permission.</p><p>Copyrighted works enter the public domain only when they grow
old and the copyrights expire. Everything else, including certainly
any computer software of recent vintage, is owned by somebody
somewhere. It is not &ldquo;free&rdquo; for the taking.</p><p>The legal monopolies for software under copyright laws last a
very long time. Under current law, copyright extends for the life
of the author plus 70 years; in the case of pseudonymous or
anonymous works or works made for hire, copyright extends for 95
years from the year of first publication or 120 years from the year
of its creation, whichever expires first. The software industry is
new, so it is rare today to find any important software for which
the copyright has expired. (Congress recently extended the length
of copyright term in a provision that has been described derisively
as a special boon to the Walt Disney Company to protect its
copyrights in Mickey Mouse cartoons. That extension has been
challenged in the US Supreme Court as inconsistent with the
Constitutional objective to grant copyright monopolies in order to
encourage the progress of science and the arts.)</p><p>Just as there is nothing in the law that permits a person to
dump personal property on a public highway, there is nothing that
permits the dumping of copyrighted works into the public domain,
except as happens in due course when any applicable copyrights
expire. Until those copyrights expire, no mechanism is in the law
by which an owner of software can simply elect to place it in the
public domain.</p><p>One exception can be found in section 105 of the Copyright
Act. Works written by the US government cannot obtain copyright
protection and so are automatically in the public domain. Court
decisions and Congressional statutes are obvious examples. However,
this exception applies only to works created by employees of the US
government and typically not by contractors to the government.
University researchers and government laboratories ordinarily own
copyrights in their works and can license them to third
parties.</p><p>For these reasons, the &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; solution for free
and open-source software is largely irrelevant.</p><p>Though there is no useful &ldquo;public domain&rdquo; repository of
computer software, it is possible for a software creator to give it
away. One doesn't have to be a lawyer to craft appropriate
language: &ldquo;This is my software. I hereby give it away to anyone
who wants it for any purpose whatsoever.&rdquo;</p><p>Unfortunately, such gifts are illusory. Under basic contract
law, a gift cannot be enforced. The donor can retract his gift at
any time, for any reason&mdash;scant security for someone intending to
make long-term use of a piece of software.</p><p>This &ldquo;Give-It-Away&rdquo; license provides no protection for
anyone if the donated software causes harm. Obviously one cannot
intentionally give away something he knows to be dangerous; that is
criminal behavior. But, neither can one escape a lawsuit because
his gift was only accidentally harmful. The risk of such a license
is far greater than the warm feelings that enrich the soul of the
giver. One important value of a license is the opportunity to
disclaim warranties and distribute the software &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo;. If you
give software away, you may retain a risky warranty
obligation.</p><p>Notice also that the donor under this &ldquo;Give-It-Away&rdquo;
license has not placed any restrictions on the gift. For example, a
recipient can make secret changes to the donated software and
re-release the changed version for a fee under a proprietary
license. To many people in the Free Software and Open Source
movement, this violates another fundamental objective: the
recipients of free or open-source software should abide by the same
&ldquo;published source&rdquo; rules as the original donor. If recipients
distribute the donated software, with or without changes, they
should also publish their source code. The &ldquo;Give-It-Away&rdquo; license
doesn't force reciprocal source code publication. (Neither, for
that matter, do the BSD, MIT, Apache and similar software
licenses.) If you want to impose conditions on copying or
distribution of software&mdash;even the minimal set of conditions
allowed under the Open Source Definition&mdash;you must use a license
rather than rely on a gift to the &ldquo;public domain&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Caveat emptor</em></span>. Use the &ldquo;Give-It-Away&rdquo;
license at your own risk. And don't accept gifts of software
presuming they are in the public domain. If you want to give away
software for any use whatsoever, use a simple license such as the
MIT license.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
