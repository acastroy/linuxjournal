at this. Yes, you are watching a movie of yourself from a few
moments ago. Why? As you know, Fran&ccedil;ois, the theme of this
issue is security. As everyone is talking computer and network
security, I wanted to offer our guests something a little
different. Security, like wine, comes in many flavors,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?
</p><p>Here you are coming back from the cellar. You have a very
amusing walk, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. Fran&ccedil;ois, you
are not looking. What has you distracted? Ah, I see. Our guests
have arrived. Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>! Please, sit
down and make yourselves comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois, run down to
the wine cellar and bring back that 1997 Napa Valley Merlot we were
sampling earlier. You will love this wine, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>--deep red with lots of black raspberry and cherry
flavors and long on finish.</p><p>There he is! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mes amis</em></span>, let me direct
your attention to this monitor. Watch closely. As you can see,
Fran&ccedil;ois is in the east wing of the wine cellar. The reason
I am showing you this is to introduce you to our menu for today,
&ldquo;Security with a Touch of Video&rdquo;. When we talk security in the
Linux kitchen, we almost always mean network security. On some rare
occasions, we are willing to discuss user security. But what about
home security? Perhaps you have an extensive wine cellar that you
want to keep an eye on. Isn't that expensive? Complicated? Did you
know you can set up a video surveillance system for not much more
than the cost of an inexpensive webcam? For this recipe, I used a
Creative Labs CT6840 USB camera from Radio Shack, my Linux system
and a few keystrokes. Sounds good? But wait; as they say on
television, there's more.</p><p>Inexpensive and simple video surveillance is particularly
interesting when combined with motion detection technology. That's
the idea behind Lawrence P. Glaister's Gspy, a GNOME security
camera application. You even can use Gspy to generate daily MPEG
movies for later perusal with the Berkeley MPEG tools (more on that
shortly). The software captures frames in JPEG format at regular
intervals that you can define. Once the absence of motion is
confirmed, less frames are written out, although all frames
continue to be date- and timestamped. As soon as motion is
detected, regular, high-frame capture resumes. This results in a
time-lapse video that concentrates on areas of interest. Figure 1
shows a snapshot of Gspy in action.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6232f1.large.jpg"><img src="6232f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Under the Watchful Eye of
Gspy</p></div></div>
</p><p>A successful implementation of Gspy will require the
video4linux extensions (in 640 &times; 480 size) and most likely
USB support (for the camera). That means you should probably be
running a fairly recent Linux distribution or kernel. To get
started, pick up the Gspy source at
<a href="http://gspy.sourceforge.net" target="_self">gspy.sourceforge.net</a>.</p><p>Once you have the source safely on your hard disk, it is time
for the classic extract and build five-step:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf gspy-0.1.4-src.tar.gz
cd gspy
./configure
make
su -c make install
</pre><p>That is all there is to it. Almost. I mentioned the creation
of movies, so let us look at what we will need to do this. You will
need a program called mpeg_encode, part of the Berkeley MPEG tools,
available at
<a href="http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/frame/research/mpeg/mpeg_encode.html" target="_self">bmrc.berkeley.edu/frame/research/mpeg/mpeg_encode.html</a>.
Now, extract the source and switch to that directory:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf mpeg_encode-1.5b-src.tar.gz
cd mpeg_encode
</pre>


Ah, the young lady at table 22 noticed that I did not have you jump
into the classic extract and build five-step. Bravo, Mademoiselle.
Building the Berkeley MPEG tools is not complicated, but it does
require a little advance tweaking. For starters, you need to edit
the Makefile and comment out the current CFLAGS definition and also
uncomment the line that corresponds to a Linux build (just search
for LINUX). Then, you need to comment out the malloc definition in
headers/libpnmrw.h. Here's what that section looks like:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* #include &lt;malloc.h&gt;
#if !defined(sco) &amp;&amp; !defined(sgi) &amp;&amp; !defined(IRIX)
extern char* malloc();
#endif */
</pre>


Note the comment start (<b  >/*</b>) at the beginning of
the first line and the comment end (<b  >*/</b>) at the
end of the last line. I also needed to comment out the
<b  >extern char* sys_errlist[]</b>; definition in
libpnmrw.c before I could build the package. When you have done all
this, you can do a <b  >make</b> followed by a
<b  >su -c make install</b>. Is there, you ask, an easier
way? The answer is yes. You'll find prebuilt RPMs if you do a quick
search for mpeg_encode at
<a href="http://www.rpmfind.net" target="_self">www.rpmfind.net</a>.
</p><p>So, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, now we have everything we
need. Start the program by typing <b  >gspy &amp;</b>.
Gspy makes use of /dev/video0 as the default input device, but you
can change it with the Preferences menu. Have a look at Figure 2
for a snapshot of the configuration dialog. I have specified a
folder called &ldquo;spy&rdquo; in my home directory. In that folder, the
application will create another folder whose name is the date on
which the pictures are taken; for instance, the folder for July 19,
2002 is called 20020719. Individual images are stored in the files,
and the number of images depends on several things.</p><p>Look again at the General configuration tab where I have
defined a picture interval of one second. I also have told the
program to store an image every 20 seconds. This means that even if
no motion is registered, a frame still will be saved (complete with
data and timestamp) every 20 seconds.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6232f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Configuration Options for Gspy
</p></div></div><p>The other tabs allow you to specify the video4linux device
(/dev/video0 by default), various alarm thresholds and a checkbox,
should you feel the need to have the system beep each time it
notices movement.</p><p>The obvious catch is you can use up a fairly large amount of
disk space on this task, so please be aware of this. When you have
collected enough information, you can click File on the Application
menu and elect to compile all your frames into an MPEG movie, which
will be called video.mpg. After the movie has been created
(remember more frames means more time, so be patient), you can fire
up your favorite MPEG viewer and watch the action. Aside from some
nice graphical players included with GNOME or KDE, you probably
also have the simple plaympeg program pre-installed as part of the
smpeg package.</p><p>Motion, as the name implies, is another video program that
employs video4linux support with motion detection. The approach,
however, is a bit different. First of all, the program is command
line-based and provides a great deal of configuration options
through a global configuration file (/usr/local/etc/motion.conf by
default). The program can run as a d&aelig;mon in the background,
only storing images when motion is detected. Like Gspy, Motion also
can take all those captured frames and assemble them (using the
Berkeley MPEG tools) into a movie for later viewing. Motion also
can output to other programs, run programs before or after
detection and store data to an SQL database. The web site also
provides links to external programs that have been developed to
work with Motion.</p><p>To get started, head on over to the Motion web site at
<a href="http://motion.technolust.cx" target="_self">motion.technolust.cx</a>.
When I dropped by, I picked up version 3.0.4 of the program. This
is another simple build following the familiar extract and build
five-step:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf motion-3.0.4.tar.gz
cd motion-3.0.4
./configure
make
su -c make install
</pre><p>That's all there is to it. To run the program, you can just
type <b  >motion</b> and accept all the defaults that
exist in the configuration file at /usr/local/etc/motion.conf. Or
you can pass command-line arguments like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
motion -B -w -g 30 -t /home/mgagne/motion
</pre>


Before I explain these arguments, I should tell you that the
defaults in the configuration file caused the program to fail with
a VIDIOCGCHAN error. That's because I wasn't using the video
loopback option (which requires a separate driver), but the
configuration file still had it set. If you run into the same
problem, comment out the <b  >input 2</b> line near the
top of the file. The paragraph looks something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
# The input to be used
# Default: 8
input 2
</pre>


The last line is the one I commented out with a hash mark. Now that
I've told you about my trials and tribulations, let me tell you
about those command-line switches. The -B option tells Motion to
create MPEG movies after registering an event. The -w activates the
light-switch filter, which tells motion to ignore (more or less)
changes in light levels as events, whereas the -g option defines
the number of seconds between events. Finally, you'll want to have
some place where these images are stored, and this is what the -t
option is all about.
</p><p>One other problem you may experience has to do with how you
came by your MPEG tools. If you built from source, the mpeg_encode
program will be in the /usr/local/bin directory. If you used the
RPM package, the binary will be under /usr/bin. Motion looks for
mpeg_encode in the /usr/local/bin, so you'll need to modify the
configuration file for things to work properly. Look for the
following line in /usr/local/etc/motion.conf and make sure it is
uncommented:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mpeg_encode yes
</pre><p>If you used the RPM package, add the following line below the
one above:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mpeg_encode_bin /usr/bin/mpeg_encode
</pre>


While Motion runs and captures, it stores the images in the
directory you specified but with this structure: there will be a
subdirectory for the year, followed by one for the month, then the
hour and finally, the minute. Movies generated with the -B option
will appear in the day folder. For instance, the movies that Motion
captured as I wrote this column were in
/home/mgagne/motion/2002/07/19.
</p><p>The configuration file contains a number of parameters that
can be set there rather than at the command line. The file is
fairly easy to understand, and you should take the time to go
through it. One setting that I found particularly useful was this
one:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
jpg_cleanup yes
</pre><p>If you are creating movies after each event, it might make
sense to get rid of the saved JPEG images. This little setting will
do it for you automatically. Also consider setting &ldquo;quiet yes&rdquo;
unless you want motion to beep each and every single time it
detects movement. Therein lies madness.
</p><p>As closing time draws near, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I
must confess to an overwhelming feeling of being watched. As this
tends to make me a little nervous, I must share with you my
favorite means of calming these feelings. Fran&ccedil;ois, please
refill our guests' wineglasses a final time. And whatever you do,
make sure you keep that camera trained on the wine cellar. Until
next month. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;</em></span>!
