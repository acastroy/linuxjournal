EnGarde Secure Linux is a small office server distribution with a
number of security features. These include a secure mail server, a
secure web server supporting virtual hosts, a file server, DNS
capabilities and a small office firewall.
</p><p>With web administration capabilities and services for
Microsoft client OSes, EnGarde offers a powerful setup in an
easy-to-use box, and it accomplishes most of this using free
software.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x24716b8"></a>Installation and Setup</h2></div></div><p>These days, one of the biggest things I look for with Linux
distributions is how well they have solved the installation
process. The installation of EnGarde was quite easy to accomplish.
The text-based installer is much like the old Red Hat installations
used to be. During the installation, you select what type of
machine you would like to build (you can, of course, build
combinations). You can choose from a firewall, a network intrusion
detection system (using Snort), a database server (running MySQL),
a secure mail (SMTP, POP, IMAP) server, a VPN appliance, a DNS
server or a secure web server. The proper components and only the
proper components are installed, meaning you have a trimmed-up
system on the network installed with a reasonable set of
defaults.</p><p>Configuration is done via the WebTool interface, though you
can always access the system via the command line. X is not
installed. After your initial reboot, you configure a few
parameters on the host via a web browser, and then reboot again.
From there you can configure various server parameters, including
the certificates for your secure web or mail servers, firewall
parameters, or the like.</p><p>The WebTool UI is also an easy-to-use system interface,
allowing you to check on your system, control services and view
system parameters. As an example, you can control access to the SSH
d&aelig;mon via the UI, controlling the addresses, users and groups
who can connect. System logs and backups also can be controlled
from the WebTool interface.</p><p>Several server components that can be installed and managed
using EnGarde Secure Linux are worth noting. One of the features of
the secure e-mail server is SquirrelMail, a web-based e-mail
solution. SquirrelMail can provide a well-sized workgroup or user
base with a feature-rich and platform-independent e-mail solution
that is managed on a secure platform. The WebTool UI can be used to
configure the e-mail system, including the SSL enhanced POP3 and
IMAP servers and the Postfix SMTP server.</p><p>An additional component is BIND 8.2.5 used as a DNS server.
This can provide a rich set of DNS features, including split and
dynamic DNS, all of which are configurable by the WebTool UI.
Furthermore, the web server, along with virtual hosts and SSL
certificates, is managed by the WebTool UI, giving users a powerful
interface for a complete server. Lastly, the UI can be used to
configure the firewall and port redirection rules, but at this time
this feature isn't as mature as it could be.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x2471920"></a>Security in the Core</h2></div></div><p>As part of the default installation, EnGarde installs a
number of components that many administrators wind up installing
later. The first is the OpenWall patch, which provides a
non-executable stack. This works well to prevent a number of the
common buffer-overflow exploits typically seen, but it doesn't stop
exploits such as heap exploits, format string attacks or
configuration problems.</p><p>Secondly, the Tripwire host-based intrusion detection system
is installed in the base installation. Tripwire builds a database
and monitors files for changes, keeping track of several
characteristics for each file. This method goes well beyond the MD5
sums and dates monitored by the RPM tool in verify mode, and it
provides a rigorous monitor of your host's filesystem.</p><p>Lastly, the LIDS access control system is installed with the
default kernel. You can also boot a standard kernel lacking the
LIDS system, should you need to. LIDS provides a way to minimize
the impact any attacker could cause.</p><p>Best practices are also in play, as you would expect.
Connections via FTP are disabled by default, Telnet is not
installed, and SSH connections are controlled via private key
authentication. The UI generates and downloads a private SSH key
that you can then use with your SSH client to connect to the
EnGarde server.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x2471b30"></a>Updates Are Easy</h2></div></div><p>Commercial Guardian Digital customers are allowed to use the
Guardian Digital Secure Network to keep their system current. As
new packages are released you can install them via the UI, making
it easy to stay up-to-date with the patches as they're
released.</p><p>One concern I typically have with an automatic update system
is lost configurations or the use of a new one. As an example,
OpenSSH moved from /etc/sshd_config to /etc/ssh/sshd_config as its
d&aelig;mon configuration file. During an update it's not clear if
the configuration file is being respected or not, so when something
breaks you're left to fix it via the CLI. This can, of course,
break the UI interaction and spiral downward quickly if you're not
careful. Still, Guardian seems to have managed this pretty well; I
was able to update my OpenSSH installation using this mechanism
without any errors or loss of connectivity.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x2471c90"></a>Appearances Aren't Everything</h2></div></div><p>When I initially began to poke around the system, I was
startled to find software with somewhat vintage version numbers.
This includes the OpenSSH package and the 2.2.19 kernel.</p><p>To more thoroughly understand the reasons for this, as well
as ensure that Guardian Digital knew what they were doing, I spoke
with a company representative during the course of this evaluation.
We had a productive conversation and many of my concerns were
addressed.</p><p>Guardian Digital chose to use the 2.2 kernel series due to
the company's concerns about the stability and security of the 2.4
kernels. The 2.4 kernel series was less mature during the
development and engineering of EnGarde Secure Linux. As such, the
Engineering team decided to go with proven technology, a wise move
for a security product. Key features and fixes were
back-ported.</p><p>Furthermore, the OpenWall kernel patch, which provides
privacy enhancements and a non-executable stack, is production
quality only for the 2.2 kernel series. So choosing security and
stability over being cutting edge, EnGarde ships with a 2.2.19
kernel.</p><p>Similarly, the choice of having OpenSSH remain at version 2.3
was based on the principle of &ldquo;if it isn't broken, don't fix it&rdquo;.
Again, this is a wise move for a security product or any core
infrastructure product. Although features and enhancements have
been integrated, there was no need to upgrade to a newer version
until the recent remote hole was detected in OpenSSH. At that time,
EnGarde quickly issued an OpenSSH 3.3p1 package and introduced the
privsep capability in their version of OpenSSH.</p><p>All of these concerns were addressed in this conversation
with a Guardian Digital representative. I agree with their choices
to pick known security concerns and fixes over unknowns in both
security and stability.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x2471f50"></a>Room for Improvement</h2></div></div><p>During the course of my testing EnGarde, I found several
areas for improvement. Although some of these areas are addressed
by other products or may not be appropriate for the nature of
EnGarde Secure Linux 1.2, their inclusion would strengthen an
otherwise leading-edge product.</p><p>An ability to modify the Tripwire database settings, such as
where to store it and an improved UI for reports, would be nice.
While the UI does do text reports, slogging through pages of flat
text with no highlighting or coloration makes it difficult to spot
changes. A different, write-once storage location for the database
greatly would improve the security of the system as well.</p><p>Similarly, a configuration tool for the LIDS system also
would be a wise addition. LIDS can be powerful, but the ability to
change it requires a fairly in-depth understanding of capabilities.
A simple UI to grant or revoke such capabilities would be useful
for the the EnGarde system, much like the one IRIX offers. It
wouldn't have to be complex, but enough to ensure that the LIDS
features were being used in a manner consistent for the
site.</p><p>Password management on EnGarde also could be improved.
Several of the suggestions for passwords, useful for the mail
server, for example, are rather weak and easily guessable. The
integration of a password suggestion tool, one that does much
stronger suggestions, would have been a welcome finding.</p><p>The firewall services are based on ipchains, which is a
stateless firewall tool. This means it cannot understand
connections, only flags on a per-packet basis, something that the
2.4 firewall package Netfilter can do. The addition of a tool such
as SPF, which can add this capability to ipchains, would make their
firewall more robust.</p><p>Lastly, a small office most certainly could use a robust web
proxy service. The firewall configuration tool can allow you to use
the built-in ipchains application assistants, but they're no equal
to a solid proxy.</p><p>Some of these concerns cannot be addressed in the corporate
product that EnGarde is aiming to be. However, some of them only
can enhance what is shaping up to be a class leader.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2379580.0x2472268"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>Guardian Digital is making great strides with their EnGarde
Secure Linux Professional distribution. With the 1.2 release of
their product, they demonstrate how well a Linux solution can fit
into a Windows-based organization. Furthermore, their solution is
easy to set up and use, meaning you can secure your network without
having to become an expert at everything. A recommended
product.</p><p><a href="5961s1.html" target="_self">Product Info/Good/Bad</a></p></div></div>
