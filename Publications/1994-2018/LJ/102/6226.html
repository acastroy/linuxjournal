Almost all of the existing kernel drivers that use it also use the

in order to avoid these problems. Here's an example of a correct

often made in conjunction with the previous TIOCMIWAIT ioctl call.

operating, the code to implement this call can be quite simple. See
drivers/usb/serial/io_edgeport.c for an example.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7b580.0x1d73e48"></a>write() Rules</h2></div></div><p>The write() callback in your tty_struct can be called from
both interrupt context and user context. This is important to know,
as you should not call any function that might sleep when you are
in interrupt context. This includes any function that possibly
might call schedule(), such as the common functions like
copy_from_user(), kmalloc() and printk(). If you really want to
sleep, then please check your status by calling
in_interrupt().</p><p>The write() callback can be called when the tty subsystem
itself needs to send some data through the tty device. This can
happen if you do not implement the put_char() function in the
tty_struct. (Remember, if there is no put_char() function, the tty
layer will use the write() function.) This commonly happens when
the tty layer wants to convert a newline character to a linefeed
plus a newline character. The main point to remember here is your
write() function must not return 0 for this kind of call. This
means that you <span   class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> write that byte of data to
the device, as the caller (the tty layer) will NOT buffer the data
and try again at a later time. As the write() call cannot determine
if it is being called in place of put_char()--even if only one byte
of data is being sent&mdash;please try to implement your write() call
always to be able to accept at least one byte of data. A number of
the current USB-to-serial tty drivers do not follow this rule, and
as a result some terminal types do not work properly when connected
to them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7b580.0x1d74000"></a>set_termios() Implementation</h2></div></div><p>In order to properly implement the set_termios() callback,

variety of ways.</p><p>Listing 1 shows a simple implementation of the set_termios()

line settings that have been requested by the user.</p><p><a href="6226l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. A Simple Implementation
of the set_termios Call</a></p><p>First off, save a copy of the cflags variable from the tty
structure, as we are going to be accessing it a lot:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
        unsigned int cflag;
        cflag = tty-&gt;termios-&gt;c_cflag;
</pre><p>Next, test to see if there is anything we need to do. For
example, see if the user is trying to use the same settings we
currently have; we don't want to do any extra work if it's not
necessary.
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* check that they really want us to change
 * something */
if (old_termios) {
    if ((cflag == old_termios-&gt;c_cflag) &amp;&amp;
        (RELEVANT_IFLAG(tty-&gt;termios-&gt;c_iflag) ==
         RELEVANT_IFLAG(old_termios-&gt;c_iflag))) {
             printk (KERN_DEBUG
                     " - nothing to change...\n");
             return;
    }
}
</pre>


The RELEVANT_IFLAG() macro is defined as:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#define RELEVANT_IFLAG(iflag)
    (iflag &amp; (IGNBRK|BRKINT|IGNPAR|PARMRK|INPCK))
</pre>


and is used to mask off the important bits of the cflags variable.
Compare this value to the old value, and see if they differ. If
they don't, nothing needs to be changed, so we return. Note that we
first check that the old_termios variable actually points to
something, before we try to access a field off of it. This check is
required, because sometimes this variable will be NULL. Trying to
access a field off of a NULL pointer will cause a nasty oops in the
kernel.
</p><p>Now that we know we need to change the terminal settings,
let's look at the requested byte size:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* get the byte size */
switch (cflag &amp; CSIZE) {
    case CS5:
        printk (KERN_DEBUG " - data bits = 5\n");
        break;
    case CS6:
        printk (KERN_DEBUG " - data bits = 6\n");
        break;
    case CS7:
        printk (KERN_DEBUG " - data bits = 7\n");
        break;
    default:
    case CS8:
        printk (KERN_DEBUG " - data bits = 8\n");
        break;
        }
</pre><p>We mask the cflag with the CSIZE bit field and test the
result. If we can't figure out what bits were set, we can use the
default of 8 data bits. Then we check for the requested parity
value:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* determine the parity */
    if (cflag &amp; PARENB)
        if (cflag &amp; PARODD)
            printk (KERN_DEBUG " - parity odd\n");
        else
            printk (KERN_DEBUG " - parity even\n");
    else
        printk (KERN_DEBUG " - parity none\n");
</pre>


We first test to see if the user actually wants a type of parity
set in the first place. If so, then we need to test which kind of
parity (odd or even) they want.
</p><p>The stop bits requested are also simple to test for:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/* figure out the stop bits requested */
if (cflag &amp; CSTOPB)
    printk (KERN_DEBUG " - stop bits = 2\n");
else
    printk (KERN_DEBUG " - stop bits = 1\n");
</pre><p>Now, we're on to determining the proper flow control
settings. It's a simple process to determine if we should use
RTS/CTS:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* figure out the flow control settings */
if (cflag &amp; CRTSCTS)
    printk (KERN_DEBUG " - RTS/CTS is enabled\n");
else
printk (KERN_DEBUG " - RTS/CTS is disabled\n");
</pre>


Determining the different modes of software flow control and the
different stop and start characters, however, is a bit more
difficult:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* determine software flow control */
/* if we are implementing XON/XOFF, set the start
 * and stop character in the device */
if (I_IXOFF(tty) || I_IXON(tty)) {
    unsigned char stop_char  = STOP_CHAR(tty);
    unsigned char start_char = START_CHAR(tty);
    /* if we are implementing INBOUND XON/XOFF */
    if (I_IXOFF(tty))
        printk (KERN_DEBUG
            " - INBOUND XON/XOFF is enabled, "
            "XON = %2x, XOFF = %2x",
            start_char, stop_char);
    else
            printk (KERN_DEBUG
                    " - INBOUND XON/XOFF "
                    "is disabled");
    /* if we are implementing OUTBOUND XON/XOFF */
    if (I_IXON(tty))
        printk (KERN_DEBUG
                " - OUTBOUND XON/XOFF is enabled, "
                "XON = %2x, XOFF = %2x",
                start_char, stop_char);
    else
        printk (KERN_DEBUG
                " - OUTBOUND XON/XOFF "
                "is disabled");
}
</pre>


Finally we want to determine the baud rate. Luckily, the
tty_get_baud_rate() function can extract the specific baud rate out
of the termios settings and return it as an integer:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/* get the baud rate wanted */
printk (KERN_DEBUG " - baud rate = %d",
        tty_get_baud_rate(tty));

Now that all of the different line settings have been determined,
it is up to you to use the information to set up the device
properly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7b580.0x1d74738"></a>Other tty Information</h2></div></div><p>Vern Hoxie has an excellent set of documentation and example
programs on how to access serial ports from user space available at
<a href="ftp://scicom.alphacdc.com/pub/linux" target="_self">scicom.alphacdc.com/pub/linux</a>.
Most of this information will not be too useful for a kernel
programmer, but some of the descriptions of the different ioctl(2)
commands and the history behind the wide variety of different ways
to get and set tty information are quite good. I highly recommend
that anyone implementing a tty kernel driver read over these, if
for no other reason than to determine how users will be trying to
use your driver.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c7b580.0x1d74898"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Hopefully these two articles have helped to demystify the tty
layer. If you are stuck on how to implement a specific callback,
quite a few drivers in the kernel interact with the tty layer as
complete examples. Search for &ldquo;tty_register_driver&rdquo; in the
drivers/char and drivers/usb directories for these files.</p><p>I would like to thank Al Borchers, who helped to determine
how the write() callback really works and all of the nuances
involved in it. Together with Peter Berger, they wrote
drivers/usb/serial/digi_acceleport.c, a USB to serial driver for
the Digi AccelePort devices. It is an excellent example of a
well-working tty driver.</p></div></div>
