A few months ago, Wal-Mart.com
started selling cheap PCs equipped with no OS at all. Then they
started selling the same boxes equipped with the new Lindows OS
(which runs Linux and Windows apps). Now they've added a series of
slightly more upscale models that run Mandrake Linux.</p><p>The Lindows models run $299-$599 (US). The bottom model has

hard drive.</p><p>The Mandrake models run $391-$648 (US). The bottom model has
an AMD Duron 900MHz processor, 128MB memory and a 40GB hard drive.
The top model has an Intel 2.0GHz Pentium 4 processor, 256MB DDR
memory and a 40GB hard drive.</p><p>None come with monitors. Those begin at $128.42 (US) for a
17" model with up to 1280 &times; 1024 resolution. Color printers
start at $49.63 (US) for a Lexmark Z23.</p><p>Prices and models are from mid-July 2002.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2629580.0x2722630"></a>The Subject of This Month's Quiz Is &ldquo;Mail&rdquo;</h2></div></div><p></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2629580.0x2722738"></a>Questions</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Q1</b></span> Eric Allman wrote the

Forward</h2></div></div><p>Founded by Rob Glaser, a former high-level Microsoft
executive, RealNetworks has been a highly proprietary streaming
media business that seemed to fit the Microsoft mold. Yet
RealNetworks' biggest competitor also happened to be Microsoft,
which lately had become more and more aggressive in the streaming
media business.</p><p>In July, RealNetworks embarked on an extreme strategy: they
took part of their software open source. Specifically, they
announced Helix, a set of tools for streaming and caching &ldquo;all
major media types&rdquo;, including RealAudio/RealVideo, QuickTime,
MPEG-2, MPEG-4, Windows Media and Ogg Vorbis. At the time of the
announcement, the server was slated to run on 11 different
operating systems, including Linux. RealNetworks claimed that the
server, running on Linux, delivered four times the performance of
Windows Media Server 8 while delivering Windows Media and Real
files simultaneously.</p><p>The Real codecs are still available only through a strictly
proprietary license. When I interviewed Rob Glaser at the O'Reilly
Open Source Convention&mdash;on the day RealNetworks announced Ogg
Vorbis support&mdash;he compared the role of codecs to that of packaging
in a shipping system. RealNetworks' business is shipping bits, not
packaging them, he explained. Customers can use Real's own
packaging, or whatever else they like, such as Ogg Vorbis,
QuickTime, Windows Media Player, etc.</p><p>At the time of this writing there are two licenses: a
proprietary &ldquo;RealNetworks Community Source License (RCSL)&rdquo;, which
is &ldquo;structured to ensure that all products built under the RCSL
remain compatible with the Helix interfaces&rdquo;, and a RealNetworks
Public Source License (RPSL), which &ldquo;is structured to provide
developers greater flexibility in their use of the source code&rdquo;.
This one is described as &ldquo;similar&rdquo; to the GPL in respect to
certain copyleft provisions, but different in respect to &ldquo;patent
issues&rdquo;. The company also will license several patents and pending
patent applications to the Helix community.</p><p>After the announcement, Bruce Perens published a detailed
analysis of RealNetwork's plans at that point. He wrote:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>&ldquo;The RealNetworks server and 'encoder engine',
without the actual codecs, will be under a 'community source'
license. This means that source code will be disclosed to people
who sign an agreement, and those people will get a lot less than
the full set of rights that come with open-source licensing. Since
other streaming servers and encoders are already fully open source,
we can't expect the Open Source community to have much to do with
this part of RealNetworks' code.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;The RealAudio and RealVideo codecs will be
available in compiled form, as proprietary software that can be
linked into a larger product. Again, no joy in the Free Software
camp. However, these codecs will be available for use along with
various open-source pieces that Real is releasing, and thus it will
be easier to for third parties to produce a half-proprietary
Real-format player under Linux and on other operating systems where
one is not supported today.&rdquo;</p></li></ul></div><p>The announcement drew inevitable comparisons to Netscape's
announcement of Mozilla in 1998&mdash;after which the project took more
than four years to deliver a 1.0 product. &ldquo;Unlike the Mozilla
Project, we do not plan on rewriting everything from scratch&rdquo;, one
Real employee wrote to me.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2629580.0x2b1ba08"></a>They Said It</h2></div></div><p>What you need is a nerdy guy who'd do anything for you. Who
would leave presents at your door and make web sites in your image:
beautiful and grand, lyrical and edgy. You need a geek who would
wait years for you, secretly, despite his own welfare. You need
someone who won't make fun of the bad music kids these days
love.</p><p>Instead of trolling the skate parks and beaches, you should
sit outside a cyber caf&eacute; or an engineering department,
browse through the aisles of Fry's Electronics, become a member of
the Battery Club at Radio Shack.</p><p>&mdash;Tony Pierce</p><p>Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a

knowing which ones to keep.</p><p>&mdash;Scott Adams</p><p>Proprietary data is the root of tyranny.</p><p>&mdash;Britt Blaser</p><p>The user group communities in the Bay Area have dwindled
away, largely because installing and using GNU/Linux isn't as
exciting or new or challenging anymore. Installfests made sense in
the Slackware era, but now any newbie can point-and-click through a
Mandrake install. I can now safely write about the user groups in
the past tense.</p><p>&mdash;Nick Moffitt</p></div></div>
