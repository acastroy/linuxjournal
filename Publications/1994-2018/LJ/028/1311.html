    The long-awaited Linux 2.0 is about to be released.  What's
    new? Plenty.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a94580.0x2b8c2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>As I write, the final touches are being
put on Linux version 2.0. By the time you read this, it probably
will have been released, and vendors will be working on
distributions which include it. Do you want to upgrade?
</p><p>If you have hardware that was not supported by 1.2.12, or not
supported well, you probably have good reason to upgrade to 2.0.
But even if your hardware is supported perfectly well by Linux 1.2,
you may still want to upgrade. Linux 2.0 is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fast</em></span>. Swapping is fast. Under X, windows
appear more quickly. X runs more smoothly. Performance under heavy
load is improved. After a few minutes of version 1.3.100 (almost
2.0...), I was not interested in running version 1.2.13 any
more.</p><p>Whether you choose to upgrade by obtaining all the new pieces
from the Internet, or by waiting for your distribution vendor to
provide you with a new version, you probably do want to
upgrade.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a94580.0x2b8c500"></a>Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>There is a small price to pay for upgrading: several system
utilities need to be upgraded in order for 2.0 to work. The system
will still run with the old versions, but some functions won't
work; in particular, the format of the /proc filesystem has
changed, and the <span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span> utility has to
be replaced. Also, in order to use PPP, a new
<span   class="bold"><b>pppd</b></span> daemon needs to be installed.
But unlike the upgrade from 1.0.9 to 1.2.13, when we had to publish
an article on how to upgrade here in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Linux 2.0 comes with a files called
Documentation/Changes that tells you exactly what you need to
change and where to get the new versions.</p><p>That's just a taste of the new focus on documentation; the
Documentation directory tree includes documentation on everything
from hunting down and reporting bugs to Linux's support for SMP
(<span   class="bold"><b>s</b></span>ymmetric
<span   class="bold"><b>m</b></span>ulti-<span   class="bold"><b>p</b></span>rocessing:
multiple CPUs in one machine, all sharing the same main memory).
There is also an improved configuration system: it includes both
text-based and X-based menuing systems, with a built-in help system
to explain each configuration choice. Instead of <b  >make
config</b>, choose <b  >make menuconfig</b> or
<b  >make xconfig</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a94580.0x2b8c978"></a>Improvements</h2></div></div><p>I mentioned improved performance. This is due both to
significant restructuring of memory management and significant
improvements in task scheduling. These work together in several
ways to improve both throughput (the total amount of work that can
be done in a certain amount of time) and interactive response to s
user's input (typing, mouse movements, etc.).
</p><p>Automatic, on-demand loading and unloading of kernel modules
is available, and almost every driver can be compiled as a loadable
module, saving precious, unswappable kernel memory. See
<a href="../028/1279.html" target="_self">Auto-loading
Kernel Modules</a> elsewhere in this issue.</p><p>SCSI support has also been improved; wide SCSI support now
includes all 15 possible devices on supported wide SCSI controllers
and SCSI error handling has been improved. Improved SCSI drivers
are available for the BusLogic MultiMaster series, the Adaptec 2940
series, and the NCR53c8xx series, among others.</p><p>Those of you with IDE have not been ignored&mdash;support for
several new high-end IDE interfaces is available, and bug fixes for
the buggy interfaces (RZ1000 and CMD640) have been incorporated.
Support for IDE tape drives is now included.</p><p>Linux 2.0 includes SMP support for Intel MP-compliant
systems. In addition, some SPARC SMP systems are supported by the
experimental Linux/SPARC source included, as well as improved file
locking, including a full implementation of mandatory file locking.
The /proc filesystem has been expanded and far more system
information is available in /proc. A &ldquo;watchdog&rdquo; has been
developed especially for unattended systems. This includes software
and optional hardware support for rebooting a hung system.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a94580.0x2b8cc38"></a>Networking Improvements</h2></div></div><p>Native AppleTalk networking has been added to Linux's
impressive list of supported networking protocols, and the existing
protocols (especially TCP) were improved. Filesystem support for
NCP (Novell) and SMB (MS Lan Manager, etc.) network filesystems has
been added. In addition, the NFS filesystem has been greatly
improved in conjunction with the memory management improvements; it
is now as fast or faster than most other implementations. It is
also now possible to keep your root file system on an NFS server,
which was made practical by those changes.</p><p>There is also expanded support for network devices: many ISDN
cards, some frame relay cards, and general synchronous networking
support to make it easier to add further synchronous network
support. Support for several 100Mbps Ethernet cards, including the
popular DEC tulip series and the 3COM 3C590 series, has been added.
The improved PPP code now supports &ldquo;BSD compression&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a94580.0x2b8cd98"></a>Experimental Features</h2></div></div><p>There are also (clearly marked!) features which are
experimental in nature.</p><p>More multiple platforms support than ever is included in 2.0.
While Linux/Alpha is now as stable as Linux/i86, experimental
support for SPARCs, PowerPCs, Amigas, Ataris, M68K/VME and a few
MIPS-based platforms is also included.</p><p>Experimental support for running Java applications as
&ldquo;native binaries&rdquo; is available by making them look almost like
shell scripts to Linux, running the proper interpreter
automatically when you attempt to run the Java application.</p></div></div>
