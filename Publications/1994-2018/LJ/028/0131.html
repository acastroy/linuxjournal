    Certifying Linux to POSIX 1.1.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1add580.0x1bd53f8"></a>Standards</h2></div></div><p>Part of the success of Linux is due to its commission to
standards. One of the first standards for Unix-like operating
systems was POSIX.1 (IEC/ISO 9945-1:1990 or IEEE Std. 1003.1-1990),
which specifies the system services, the interface and system
limits. It has been adopted by all major Unix vendors since its
introduction. Higher levels like XPG4 from X/Open (a group of
computer vendors) are upwardly compatible with POSIX.1. Finally,
once an operating system is branded for Single Unix (or Spec 1170)
it may be officially named Unix (TM) (a name which is controlled by
X/Open).</p><p>Fortunately the design of Linux was aimed at POSIX.1, so
nearly all necessary functionality had been implemented from the
beginning; however, it needed testing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1add580.0x1bd5558"></a>Goal</h2></div></div><p>Our primary goal at Unifix was a standard called Federal
Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 151-2 from the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a U.S. Government
institute. FIPS 151-2 requires some features that are optional in
POSIX.1; thus, FIPS 151-2 includes POSIX.1 and more. We intended to
get a certification for Linux on Intel platforms.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1add580.0x1bd5660"></a>Where to Start?</h2></div></div><p>Although usually linked to programming languages, ANSI-C
(ISO/IEC 9899:1990) is a must for FIPS 151-2, and this was the
first standard to meet. R&uuml;diger Helsch from Unifix began to
clean up header files (namespace pollution issues) and fix the math
library to ensure full ANSI-C conformance. Testing was done using
our own tools.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1add580.0x1bd5768"></a>FIPS 151-2 at Unifix</h2></div></div><p>In Fall 1995 we acquired the test suite for FIPS 151-2 from
NIST. The test procedures are defined in IEEE Std 1003.3-1991 and
2003.3-1992. The first differences were found when compiling the
test programs. At a later stage the generated reports showed where
tests had failed. In the following months we did a lot of kernel,
libc and test program recompiles (more than 80 kernel compiles).
Don't try that on a 386 SX with 4 megs! Most fixes had to be done
in exit.c and in the termios package. After roughly 250 fixes in
our system, and two fixes in the test programs, NISTs bin/verify
reported no more non-compliant behaviour. We felt some pride at
that point but were not finished yet. R&uuml;diger wrote the
mandatory POSIX Conformance Document, where all system limits and
characteristics are specified. Hint: there is an easy way to check
for POSIX.1 compliance; a system without these docs is never
compliant.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1add580.0x1bd5870"></a>FIPS 151-2 in the Independent Testing
Laboratory</h2></div></div><p>Unifix is located in Braunschweig, Germany. and our
independent testing laboratory is located in the U.S. So we had to
transfer our modified Linux along with instructions for setting up
a test PC to reproduce our test results. The lab did a completely
new testing and is responsible for compliance afterwards. They were
not allowed to use any pre-run test results, so everything had to
be done from scratch. After some long-distance calls, all
configuration mismatches had been ironed out (the very last problem
was a suitable serial loopback cable), and the tests ran
successfully. We entered the product at that point under the name
Linux-FT and our newly founded company as Open Linux Ltd. (an
X/Open member).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1add580.0x1bd5978"></a>The Official Acknowledgement</h2></div></div><p>To see that all went well, we e-mailed to POSIX@nist.gov with
topic <span   class="bold"><b>send 151-2reg</b></span>. The mailrobot
returned a list with all certified products, one of which was our
system.</p><p>Was it worth it? It took considerable money and effort to get
to this point. Our partner from the UK, Lasermoon, supported us
financially and logistically. We are convinced we have gained much
more stability and portability through the certification process.
Signal handling improved considerably. A lot of small quirks and
flaws scattered throughout the sources have been fixed. Most of
those ugly #ifdef linux hacks in applications are disappearing. For
application developers and porters these advantages are obvious.
Linux-FT is now available and contains all source code (as ensured
by GPL).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1add580.0x1bd5b30"></a>And Beyond?</h2></div></div><p>Yes, we will do more certifications. POSIX.2 and XPG4 Base
are the next stages, and finally the Single Unix branding. We are
currently working on them and we hope our current product will
enable us to reach XPG4 certification this summer. In the long term
we intend our POSIX.1 changes to flow back into the mainstream
kernels and libs (see the math lib, for example). The Linux 2.0
kernel sources will probably be run through our test suite before
release.</p></div></div>
