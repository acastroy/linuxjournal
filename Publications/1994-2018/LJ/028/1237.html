    &ldquo;Kernel patches&rdquo; may sound like magic, but the two tools
    used to create and apply patches are simple and easy to
    use&mdash;if they weren't, some Linux developers would be too lazy
    to use them...
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4d580.0x1f45558"></a></h2></div></div><p>Diff is designed to show you the
<span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span>erences between files, line by
line. It is fundamentally simple to use, but takes a little
practice. Don't let the length of this article scare you; you can
get some use out of diff by reading only the first page or two. The
rest of the article is for those who aren't satisfied with very
basic uses.
</p><p>While diff is often used by developers to show differences
between different versions of a file of source code, it is useful
for far more than source code. For example, diff comes in handy
when editing a document which is passed back and forth between
multiple people, perhaps via e-mail. At <i  >Linux Journal</i>, we have experience with this. Often both the
editor and an author are working on an article at the same time,
and we need to make sure that each (correct) change made by each
person makes its way into the final version of the article being
edited. The changes can be found by looking at the differences
between two files.</p><p>However, it is hard to show off how helpful diff can be in
finding these kinds of differences. To demonstrate with files large
enough to really show off diff's capabilities would require that we
devote the entire magazine to this one article. Instead, because
few of our readers are likely to be fluent in Latin, at least
compared to those fluent in English, we will give a Latin example
from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Winnie Ille Pu</em></span>, a translation by
Alexander Leonard of A. A. Milne's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Winnie The
Pooh</em></span> (ISBN 0-525-48335-7). This will make it harder for
the average reader to see differences at a glance and show how
useful these tools can be in finding changes in much larger
documents.</p><p>Quickly now, find the differences between these two
passages:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>There are several things to notice here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The file names and last dates of modification are
shown in a &ldquo;header&rdquo; at the top. The dates may not mean anything

shown preceded by spaces; those that are different in the different

<span   class="bold"><b>which</b></span> file they came from. Lines
which exist only in a file whose name is preceded by
<b  >---</b> in the header are preceded by a
<b  >-</b> character, and vice-versa for lines preceded
by a <b  >+</b> character. Another way to remember this
is to see that the lines preceded by a <b  >-</b>
character were <span   class="emphasis"><em>removed</em></span> from the first
(<b  >---</b>) file, and those preceded by a
<b  >+</b> character were <span   class="emphasis"><em>added</em></span> to
the second (<b  >+++</b>) file.</p></li><li><p>Three spelling changes have been made:
&ldquo;desendendi&rdquo; has been corrected to &ldquo;descendendi&rdquo;, &ldquo;non

interpretation isn't as immediately obvious; but by knowing that
each marked line has been changed in some way, you can figure it
out. For instance, in this comparison, where the file 3 contains
the damaged contents, and file 4 (identical to file 2 in the
previous example) contains the correct contents, three lines in a
row are changed, and now each line with a difference is not shown
directly above the corrected line:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>It takes a little more work to find the added mistakes;
&ldquo;nodum&rdquo; for &ldquo;modum&rdquo; and &ldquo;exitare&rdquo; for &ldquo;exstare&rdquo;. Imagine if
50 lines in a row had each had a one-character change, though. This
begins to resemble the old job of going through the whole file,
character-by-character, looking for changes. All we've done is
(potentially) shrink the amount of comparison you have to
do.</p><p>Fortunately, there are several tools for finding these kinds
of differences more easily. GNU Emacs has &ldquo;word diff&rdquo;
functionality. There is also a GNU &ldquo;wdiff&rdquo; program which helps
you find these kinds of differences without using Emacs.</p><p>Let's look first at GNU Emacs. For this example, files 5 and
6 are exactly the same, respectively, as files 3 and 4 before. I
bring up emacs under X (which provides me with colored text), and
type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
M-x ediff-files <span   class="emphasis"><em>RET</em></span>
5 <span   class="emphasis"><em>RET</em></span>
6 <span   class="emphasis"><em>RET</em></span>
</pre><p>In the new window which pops up, I press the space bar, which
tells Emacs to highlight the differences. Look at Figure 1 and see
how easy it is to find each changed word.</p><p><a href="1237f1.html" target="_self">Figure 1.</a> ediff-files 5 6</p><p>GNU wdiff is also very useful, especially if you aren't
running X. A pager (such as less) is all that is required&mdash;and that
is only required for large differences. The exact same set of files
(5 and 6), compared with the command <b  >wdiff -t 5
6</b>, is shown in Figure 2.</p><p><a href="1237f2.html" target="_self">Figure 2.</a> wdiff -t 5 6</p><p>If you are getting extra character sequences like
<b  >ESC[24</b> instead of getting underline and reverse
video, it's probably because you are using
<span   class="bold"><b>less</b></span>, which by default doesn't
pass through all escape characters. Use <b  >less -r</b>
instead, or use the more pager. Either should work.</p><p>wdiff uses the <span   class="emphasis"><em>termcap</em></span> database (that's
what the <b  >-t</b> option is for) to find out how to
enable underline and reverse video, and not all termcap entries are
correct. In some instances, I've found that the
<b  >linux</b> termcap entry works well for other
terminals, since the codes for turning underline and reverse video
on and off don't differ very much across terminals. To use the
linux termcap entry, you can do this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
TERM=linux wdiff -t 5 6 | less -r
</pre><p>This will work only with bourne shell derivatives such as
bash, not with csh or tesh. But since you need to do this only to
correct for a broken termcap database, this limitation shouldn't be
too much of a problem.</p><p>wdiff isn't always built with the termcap support needed to
underline and reverse video, and it's not always what you want even
if you have a working termcap database, so there's an alternate
output format that is just as easy to understand. We'll kill two
birds with one stone by also showing off wdiff's ability to deal
with re-wrapped paragraphs while showing off its ability to work
without underline and reverse video. File 8 is the same as the
correct file 2, shown at the beginning of this article, but file 7
(the corrupted one) now has much shorter lines, which makes them
even harder to compare &ldquo;by eye&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre><p>So you see that we have one seven-line chunk starting at line

three lines of unchanged context is configurable. Instead of using
the <b  >-u</b> option, you can use the <b  >-U
<i><tt>lines</tt></i></b> option to specify any
reasonable number of lines of context. You can even specify
<b  >-U 0</b> if you don't want to use any context at
all, though that is rarely useful.</p><p>What does the <b  >-u</b> (or <b  >-U

specifies the <span   class="emphasis"><em>unified diff format</em></span>, which is
the particular format covered here. Other formats include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>&ldquo;context diffs&rdquo; which have the same information

in a format that can be easily converted into a form that can be
used to cause the (nearly obsolete) editor ed to automatically

diffs are marked by the use of the character <b  >!</b>

</pre><p>There are a few other important things to note here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>In context diffs, the <b  >*</b>
character is used in place of the unified diff's
<b  >-</b> character, and the <b  >-</b>
character is used in place of the <b  >+</b> character.
The context diff format was designed before the unified diff
format, but the unified diff format's choice of characters is
mnemonic and therefore preferable.</p></li><li><p>Context diffs repeat all context twice for each
chunk. This is a waste of space in files, but far more importantly,
it separates the changes too widely, making patches less
human-readable.</p></li><li><p>Normal, old-style diffs are very contracted and use
very little space. They are useful in situations where you don't
normally expect a human to read them, where saving space makes a
lot of sense, and where they will never be applied to files which
have changed. For example, RCS (covered in the May 1996 issue of
<i  >LJ</i>) uses a format almost identical to
old-style diffs to store changes between versions of files. This
saves space and time in a situation where any context at all would
be a waste of space.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4d580.0x1f3ed58"></a>Using Patches</h2></div></div><p>When someone changes a file that other people have copies of
(source code, documentation, or just about any other text file),
they often send patches instead of (or in addition to) making the
entire new file available. If you have the old file and the
patches, you might wish that you could have a program apply the
patches. You might think that normal diff format, which was made to
look like input to the ed program, would be the best way to
accomplish this.</p><p>As it turns out, this is not true.</p><p>A program called <span   class="bold"><b>patch</b></span> has
been written which is specifically designed to apply patches to
files (change the files as specified in the patch). It correctly
recognizes all the formats of patches and applies them. With
unified and context diffs, patch can usually apply patches,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>even if lines have been added or removed from the
file</em></span>, by looking for unchanged context lines. Only if
the context lines have themselves been changed is patch likely to
fail.</p><p>To apply patches with patch, you normally have a file
containing the patch (we'll call it
<span   class="emphasis"><em>patchfile</em></span>), and then run patch:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
patch &lt; <span   class="emphasis"><em>patchfile</em></span>
</pre><p>Patch is very verbose. If it gets confused by anything, it
stops and asks you in English (it was written by a linguist, not a
computer scientist) what you want to do. If you want to learn more
about patch, the man page is unusually readable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e4d580.0x1f3f178"></a>Other Related Tools</h2></div></div><p>If you read the RCS article in the May issue (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Take
Command: Keeping Track of Change</em></span>,
<i  >LJ</i> #25, May 1996), you may have noticed that
the article talked a bit about a program called rcsdiff. rcsdiff is
really just a front end to diff. That is, it looks for arguments
that it understands (such as revision numbers and the filename) and
prepares two files representing the two versions of the file you
are examining. It then calls diff with the remaining options. The
RCS article used <b  >-u</b> to get the unified format
without explaining what it meant, but you can use
<b  >-c</b> to get context diffs, or use <b  >-U
<i><tt>lines</tt></i></b> to choose the amount of
context you get in a unified diff, or use any other diff options
you like.</p><p>You may notice that rcsdiff produces more verbose output than
normal diff. From the RCS article:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b>rcsdiff -u -r1.3 -r1.6 </b></span><span   class="emphasis"><em>foo</em></span>

+I'm now adding a few lines for
+the next version.
</pre><p>It looks just like a normal unified diff except for the first
5 lines.</p><p>This doesn't prevent you from sending patches to people. The
patch program is extremely good about ignoring extraneous
information. It can even ignore news or mail headers, extra
comments written in a file outside a patch, and people's signatures
following patches. Patch tells you when it is determining whether
text is part of a patch or not by saying
&ldquo;<b  >Hmm...</b>&rdquo;</p><p>If you don't care <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> two files differ,
but just want to know <span   class="emphasis"><em>whether</em></span> they differ, the
cmp program will tell you. It works not only for text files, but
also for binary files. In this example, the files 5 and 6 are
different; 2 and 4 are the same:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b>cmp 5 6</b></span>
5 6 differ: char 159, line 4
<span   class="bold"><b>cmp 2 4</b></span>
</pre><p>Notice that when two files are the same, cmp doesn't say
anything at all. It only tells you explicitly if the files have
been changed. For use in writing shell scripts, cmp also returns
true if the files are the same and false if they don't, as shown by
this shell session:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
<span   class="bold"><b>if cmp 5 6 ; then
  echo "same"
else
  echo "different"
fi</b></span>
5 6 differ: char 159, line 4
different
<span   class="bold"><b>if cmp 2 4 ; then
  echo "same"
else
  echo "different"
fi</b></span>
same
</pre><p>There are several other programs with related functionality.
In particular, diff3 can be used to merge together two different
files that have both been edited from a common ancestor file. That
