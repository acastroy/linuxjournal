    The proliferation
    of powerful notebook computers and wireless communication
    promises to provide users with network access at any time and
    in any location.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x274f580.0x2847920"></a></h2></div></div><p>Recent advances in hardware and
communication technologies have introduced the era of mobile
computing. The proliferation of powerful notebook computers and
wireless communication promises to provide users with network
access at any time and in any location. This continuous
connectivity will allow users to be quickly notified of changing
events and provide them with the resources necessary to respond to
them even when in transit.
</p><p>Unfortunately, present day Internetworking protocols like
TCP/IP, IPX, and Appletalk behave awkwardly when dealing with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>host</em></span> migration between networks.[footnote:In
the Internet jargon, computers are often referred to as hosts.]
Current versions of the Internet Protocol (IP) implicitly assume
the point at which a computer attaches to the Internet is fixed,
and its IP address identifies the network to which it is attached.
Datagrams are sent to a computer based on the location information
contained in its IP address.</p><p>If a mobile computer, or <span   class="emphasis"><em>mobile host</em></span>,
moves to a new network while keeping its IP address unchanged, its
address will not reflect the new point of attachment. Consequently,
existing routing protocols will be unable to route datagrams to it
correctly. In this situation, the mobile host must be reconfigured
with a different IP address representative of its new
location.</p><p>Not only is this process cumbersome for ordinary users, but
it also presents the problem of informing potential correspondents
of the new address. Furthermore, changing the IP address will cause
already-established transport layer connections (for example, ftp
or telnet sessions) to be lost. Put simply, under the current
Internet Protocol, if the mobile host moves without changing its
address, it will lose routing; but if it does change its address,
it will lose connections.</p><p>Mobile-IP is an enhancement to IP which allows a computer to
roam freely on the Internet while still maintaining the same IP
address. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is currently
developing a Mobile-IP standard which, at the time of this writing,
is in its sixteenth revision. The Mobile-IP architecture, as
proposed by the IETF, defines special entities called the
<span   class="bold"><b>Home Agent</b></span> (HA) and
<span   class="bold"><b>Foreign Agent</b></span> (FA) which cooperate
to allow a <span   class="bold"><b>Mobile Host</b></span> (MH) to
move without changing its IP address. The term
<span   class="bold"><b>mobility agent</b></span> is used to refer to
a computer acting as either a Home Agent, Foreign Agent, or both. A
network is described as having <span   class="bold"><b>mobility
support</b></span> if it is equipped with a mobility agent.</p><p>Each Mobile Host is associated with a unique home network as
indicated by its permanent IP address. Normal IP routing always
delivers packets meant for the MH to this network. When an MH is
away, a specially designated computer on this network&mdash;its Home
Agent&mdash;is responsible for intercepting and forwarding its
packets.</p><p>The MH uses a special registration protocol to keep its HA
informed of its current location. Whenever an MH moves from its
home network to a foreign network or from one foreign network to
another, it chooses a Foreign Agent on the new network and uses it
to forward a registration message to its HA.</p><p>After a successful registration, packets arriving for the MH
on its home network are <span   class="emphasis"><em>encapsulated</em></span> by its HA
and sent to its FA. Encapsulation refers to the process of
enclosing the original datagram as data inside another datagram
with a new IP header. This is similar to the post office affixing a
new address label over an older label when forwarding mail for a
recipient who has moved. The source and destination address fields
in the outer header correspond to the HA and FA, respectively. This
mechanism is also called <span   class="emphasis"><em>tunneling</em></span>, since
intermediate routers remain oblivious of the original inner-IP
header. In the absence of this encapsulation, intermediate routers
will simply return packets to the home network. On receiving the
encapsulated datagram, the FA strips off the outer header and
delivers the newly exposed datagram to the appropriate visiting MH
on its local network.</p><p>Host movements typically cause some datagrams to be lost
while routing tables at the HA and FA re-adjust to reflect the
move. However, by using retransmissions and acknowledgments,
connections maintained by the transport layer protocol are able to
survive these losses in the same way they survive losses due to
congestion. Note that even when the MH is away, datagrams meant for
it are always sent first to its home network, in many cases
resulting in a non-optimal route.</p><p><a href="1271f1.html" target="_self">Figures 1</a> and
<a href="1271f2.html" target="_self">2</a> show a mobility-supporting
internetwork which serves as an illustrative example. It shows two
mobility- supporting networks, <span   class="bold"><b>Network
A</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Network B</b></span>, which
are equipped with mobility agents
<span   class="bold"><b>MA1</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>MA2</b></span>, respectively. A mobile host,
<span   class="bold"><b>MH1</b></span>, is also shown, whose home
network is <span   class="bold"><b>Network A</b></span>. Whenever
<span   class="bold"><b>MH1</b></span> is away,
<span   class="bold"><b>MA1</b></span> acts as its home agent. When
<span   class="bold"><b>MH1</b></span> visits
<span   class="bold"><b>Network B</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>MA2</b></span> acts as its foreign
agent.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that changes introduced by Mobile-IP
are independent of the communication medium in use. Even though
this figure shows mobility support in a wired internetwork, the
Mobile-IP works just as effectively in a wireless
environment.</p><p><a href="1271f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3</a> further illustrates
the main idea behind Mobile-IP. It shows an IP datagram as it flows
from computer A (IP address 18.23.0.15) to the mobile host (IP
address 128.226.3.30). In this figure, the mobile host is shown to
be away from its home network. Hosts MA1 (IP address 128.226.3.28)
and MA2 (IP address 128.6.5.1) are acting as its home agent and
foreign agent, respectively.</p><p>The IP header in the datagram, as it leaves A, indicates
128.226.3.30 as the destination. In <a href="1271f3.html" target="_self">Figure
3</a>, this header is shown as the black portion of the
datagram. Therefore, this datagram is routed to Network A (steps 1
and 2). Here, the home agent picks up the datagram and inserts an
additional IP header before re-injecting it into the network (steps
3 and 4). The new IP header carries 128.6.5.1 as its destination
address. This header is shown with cross hatched lines in
<a href="1271f3.html" target="_self">Figure 3</a>. As this is the header
seen by intermediate routers like R1, the datagram is correctly
routed to the foreign agent (step 5). By this time, the
registration process has already informed the foreign agent of the
mobile host's presence on the local net. When the encapsulated
datagram arrives at MA2, the outer header is stripped. The newly
exposed header reveals the MH as the destination and the datagram
is forwarded appropriately (step 6).</p><p>The IETF Mobile-IP draft also allows a Mobile Host to do its
own decapsulation. In this case, the MH must acquire a temporary IP
address on the foreign network (e.g., using DHCP) to be used for
forwarding. This allows a mobile host to receive datagrams away
from its home network even in the absence of a Foreign Agent. The
downside of this approach is the kernel on the MH must now be
modified to handle encapsulated datagrams.</p><p>The steady increase in the sales of portable computers is
indicative of a growing base of mobile users. IETF's proposed
Mobile-IP standard will facilitate inter-operation between mobile
devices designed by different vendors and further contribute to the
popularization of mobile computing. Our research group at the State
University of New York at Binghamton has developed a Mobile-IP
implementation for Linux. This software and related documentation
