memory mapping technique, it gives an interesting insight into the
Linux system. I introduce memory management and its features,
enabling us to play with the console, include memory mapping in
drivers, and crash systems...
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa9580.0x1ba1608"></a>Address Spaces and Other Unreal Things</h2></div></div><p>Since the days of the 80386, the Intel world has supported a
technique called virtual addressing. Coming from the Z80 and 68000
world, my first thought about this was: &ldquo;You can allocate more
memory than you have as physical RAM, as some addresses will be
associated with portions of your hard disk&rdquo;.</p><p>To be more academic: Every address used by the program to
access memory (no matter whether data or program code) will be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>translated</em></span>--either into a physical address in
the physical RAM or an exception, which is dealt with by the OS in
order to give you the memory you required. Sometimes, however, the
access to that location in virtual memory reveals that the program
is out of order&mdash;in this case, the OS should cause a &ldquo;real&rdquo;
exception (usually <b  >SIGSEGV</b>, signal 11).</p><p>The smallest unit of address translation is the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>page</em></span>, which is 4 kB on Intel architectures and
8 kB on Alpha (defined in <b  >asm/page.h</b>).</p><p>When trying to understand the process of address resolution,
you will enter a whole zoo of page table descriptors, segment
descriptors, page table flags and different address spaces. For
now, let's just say the <span   class="emphasis"><em>linear address</em></span> is what
the program uses; using a <span   class="emphasis"><em>segment descriptor</em></span>,
it is turned into a <span   class="emphasis"><em>logical address</em></span>, which is
then resolved to a <span   class="emphasis"><em>physical address</em></span> (or a
fault) using the paging mechanism. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel
Hacker's Guide</em></span> spends 20 pages on a rather short
description of all these beasties, and I see no chance of making a
more succinct explanation.</p><p>For any understanding of the building, administration, and
scope of pages when using Linux, and how the underlying
technique&mdash;especially of the Intel family&mdash;works, you
<span   class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> to read the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel
Hacker's Guide</em></span>. It is freely available by ftp from
tsx-11.mit.edu in the /pub/linux/docs/LDP/ directory. Though the
book is slightly old [that's a gentle understatement&mdash;ED], nothing
has changed in the internals of the i386, and other processors
looks similar (in particular, the Pentium is exactly like a
386).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa9580.0x1ba1c38"></a>Pages&mdash;More Than Just a Sheet of Memory</h2></div></div><p>If you want to learn about page management, either you start
reading the nice guide <span   class="emphasis"><em>now</em></span>, or you believe
this short and abstract overview:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Every process has a virtual address space
implemented by several CPU registers which are changed during
context switches (this is the zoo of selectors and page description
pointers). By these registers, the CPU accesses all the memory
segments it needs.</p></li><li><p>Multiple levels of translation tables are used to
translate the linear address given by the process to the physical
address in RAM. The translation tables all reside in memory. They
are automatically looked up by the CPU hardware, but they are built
and updated by the OS. They are called <span   class="emphasis"><em>page descriptor
tables</em></span>. In these tables there is one entry (i.e., a
&ldquo;page descriptor&rdquo;) for every page in the process's address
space&mdash;we're talking of the logical addresses, also called virtual
addresses.</p></li></ul></div><p>We concentrate now on a few main aspects of pages as seen
<span   class="emphasis"><em>by the CPU</em></span>:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A page may be &ldquo;present&rdquo; or not&mdash;depending on
whether it is present in physical memory or not (if it has been
swapped-out, or it is a page which has not yet been loaded). A flag
in the page descriptor is used to indicate this status. Access to a
non-present page is called a &ldquo;major&rdquo; page fault. The fault is
handled in Linux by the function <b  >do_no_page()</b>,
in <b  >mm/memory.c</b>. Linux counts page faults for
each process in the field <b  >maj_flt</b> in
<b  >struct task_struct</b>.</p></li><li><p>A page may be write-protected&mdash;any attempt to write
on the page will cause a fault (called &ldquo;minor page fault&rdquo;,
handled in <b  >do_wp_page()</b> and counted in the
<b  >min_flt</b> field of <b  >struct
task_struct</b>).</p></li><li><p>A page belongs to the address space of one task or
several of them; each such task holds a descriptor for the page.
&ldquo;Task&rdquo; is what microprocessor technicians call a process.</p></li></ul></div><p>Other important features of pages, as seen <span   class="emphasis"><em>by the
OS</em></span>, are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If multiple processes use the same page of physical
memory, they are said to &ldquo;share&rdquo; it. The processes hold separate
page descriptors for shared page, and the entries can differ&mdash;for
example, one process can have write permission on the page and
another process may not.</p></li><li><p>A page may be marked as <span   class="emphasis"><em>copy on
write</em></span> (grep for <b  >COW</b> in kernel
sources). If, for example, a process forks, the child will share
the data segments with the parent, but both will be
write-protected: the pages are shared for reading. As soon as one
program writes onto a page, the page is doubled and the writing
program gets a new page; the other keeps its old one, with a
decremented &ldquo;share count&rdquo;. If the share count is already one, no
copy is performed when a minor fault happens, and the page is just
marked as writable. Copy-on-write minimizes memory usage.</p></li><li><p>A page may be <span   class="emphasis"><em>locked</em></span> against
being swapped out. All kernel modules and the kernel itself reside
in locked pages. As you might remember from the last installment,
pages which are used for DMA-transfers have to be protected against
being swapped out.</p></li><li><p>Page descriptors may also point to addresses not
located in physical RAM, but rather the ROM of certain peripherals,
RAM buffers for video cards etc., or PCI buffers. Traditionally, on
Intel architectures, the range for the first two groups is from 640
kB to 1024 kB, and the range for the PCI buffers is above
<b  >high_memory</b> (the top of physical RAM, defined in
<b  >asm/pgtable.h</b>). The range from 640 KB to 1024 kB
not used by Linux, and is tagged as <span   class="emphasis"><em>reserved</em></span>
in the <b  >mem_map</b> structure. They are the &ldquo;384k
reserved&rdquo;, appearing in the first kernel message after BogoMips
calculation.</p></li></ul></div><p>Virtual memory allows quite beautiful things like:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Demand-loading</b></span> a
program instead of loading it totally into memory at startup:
whenever you start a program, it gets its own virtual address
space, which is just associated with some blocks on your filesystem
and some space for variables, but the memory is allocated and
loading is performed only when you really
<span   class="emphasis"><em>access</em></span> the different portions of the
program.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Swapping</b></span>, in case
your memory gets tight. This means whenever Linux needs memory for
itself or a program and unused memory gets tight, it will try to
shrink the buffers for the file systems, try to &ldquo;forget&rdquo; pages
already allocated for program code that is executed (they can be
reloaded from disk at any time anyway), or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>swap</em></span> some pages containing user data to the
swap partition of the hard disk.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Memory Protection</b></span>.
Each process has its own address space and can't look at memory
belonging to other processes.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Memory Mapping</b></span>:
Just declare a portion or the whole of a file you have opened as a
part of your memory, by means of a simple function call.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa9580.0x1b99968"></a>Memory Mapping Example</h2></div></div><p>Here we are. The first assumption you should be able to make
when thinking about mmaping
(<span   class="bold"><b>M</b></span>emory
<span   class="bold"><b>Mapping</b></span>; usually pronounced
em-mapping) a character device driver is you have something like a
numbered position and length of that device. Of course, you could
count the nth byte in the stream of characters coming from your
serial line, but the mmap paradigm applies much more easily to
devices that have a well-defined beginning and end.</p><p>One character &ldquo;device&rdquo; that is used whenever you use
svgalib or the server is /dev/mem: a device representing your
<span   class="emphasis"><em>physical</em></span> memory. The server and svgalib use it
to map the video buffer of your graphics adaptor to the user space
of the server or the user process.</p><p>Once upon a time (am I that old?) people wrote games like
Tetris to act on text consoles using BASIC. They tended to write
directly into the video RAM rather than using the bloody slow means
of BASIC commands. That was exactly like using mmapping.</p><p>Looking for a small example to play with
<b  >mmap()</b>, I wrote a small program called
<span   class="bold"><b>nasty</b></span>. As you might know, Arabian
writing is right to left. Though I suppose nobody will prefer this
style with Latin letters, the following program gives you an idea
of this style. Note that nasty <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> runs on
Intel architectures with VGA.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>If</em></span> you ever run this program, run it as
root (because you otherwise won't get access to /dev/mem), run it
in text-mode (because you won't see anything when using X) and run
it with a VGA or EGA (because the program uses addresses specific
of such boards). You might see nothing. If so, try to scroll back a
few lines (Ctrl-PageUp) to the beginning of your screen
buffer.</p><pre     class="programlisting">

above?</p><p>You might change the rights for the mapped pages by removing
one of the <b  >PROT</b> flags asking for the right to
read, write or execute (<b  >PROT_READ</b>,
<b  >PROT_WRITE</b>, and <b  >PROT_EXEC</b>)
the data range mapped to the user program.</p><p>You might decide to replace <b  >MAP_SHARED</b> by
<b  >MAP_PRIVATE</b>, allowing you to read the page
without writing it (The Copy-on-Write Flag will be set: you will be
able to write to the text buffer, but the modified content will not
be flushed back to the display buffer and will go to your private
copy of the pages.)</p><p>Changing the offset parameter would allow you to adapt this
<b  >nasty</b> program to Hercules Monochrome Adapters
(by using 0xB0000 as text buffer instead of 0xB8000) or to crash a
machine (by using another address).</p><p>You might decide to apply the <b  >mmap()</b> call
to a disk file instead of system memory, converting the contents of
the file to our &ldquo;Arabia&rdquo; style (be sure to fit the length you
mmap and access to the real file length). Don't worry if your old
mmap man page tells you it is a BSD page&mdash;currently the question is
who documents the features of Linux rather than who implements
them...</p><p>Instead of passing <b  >NULL</b> as first
parameter, you might specify an address to which you wish to map
the pages. Using recent Linux versions, this wish will be ignored,
unless you add the <b  >MAP_FIXED</b> flag. In this case
Linux will un-map any previous mapping at that address and replace
it with the desired mmap. If you use this (I don't know why you
should), make sure your desired address fits a page boundary
(<b  >(addr &amp; PAGE_MASK) == addr</b>).</p><p>At last, we have really hit one of the favorite uses of
mmap&mdash;especially when you deal with small portions of large files
like databases. You will find it helpful&mdash;and faster&mdash;to map the
whole file to memory, in order to read and write it like it was
real memory, leaving to the buffer algorithms of Linux all the
oddities of caching. It will work much faster than
<b  >fread()</b> and <b  >fwrite()</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1aa9580.0x1b9a6d0"></a>VMA and other Cyberspaces</h2></div></div><p>The guy who has to care for this beautiful stuff is your poor
device driver writer. While support for <b  >mmap()</b>
on files is done by the kernel (by each file system type, indeed),
the mapping method for devices has to be directly supported by the
drivers, by providing a suitable entry in the
<b  >fops</b> structure, which we first introduced in the
March issue of <i  >LJ</i>.</p><p>First, we have a look at one of the few &ldquo;real&rdquo;
implementations for such a support, basing the discussion on the
/dev/mem driver. Next, we go on with a particular implementation
useful for frame grabbers, lab devices with DMA-support and
probably other peripherals.</p><p>To begin with, whenever the user calls
<b  >mmap()</b>, the call will reach
<b  >do_mmap()</b>, defined in the mm/mmap.c file.
<b  >do_mmap()</b> does two important things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It checks the permissions for reading and writing
the file handle against what was requested to
<b  >mmap()</b>. Moreover, tests for crossing the 4GB
limit on Intel machines and other knock out-criteria are
performed.</p></li><li><p>If those are well, a <b  >struct
vm_area_struct</b> variable is generated for the new piece of
virtual memory. Each task can own several of these structures,
&ldquo;virtual memory areas&rdquo; (VMAs).</p></li></ul></div><p>VMAs require some explanation: they represent the addresses,
methods, permissions and flags of portions of the user address
space. Your mmaped region will keep its own
<b  >vm_area_struct</b> entry in the task head. VMA
structures are maintained by the kernel and ordered in balanced
tree structures to achieve fast access.</p><p>The fields of VMAs are defined in linux/mm.h. The number and
content might be explored by looking at
/proc/<span   class="emphasis"><em>pid</em></span>/maps for any running process, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>pid</em></span> is the process ID of the requested
process. Let's do so for our small
<span   class="bold"><b>nasty</b></span> program, compiled with
gcc-ELF. While the program runs, your
/proc/<span   class="emphasis"><em>pid</em></span>/maps table will look somewhat like

applications of the mmap technique in the different character
drivers. Our concrete example is of a laboratory device with its
own RAM, CPU and, of course, analog to digital converters, digital
to analog converters, digital inputs and outputs, and clocks (and
bells and whistles).</p><p>The lab device we dealt with is able to sample steadily into
its memory and report the status of its work when asked via the
character channel, which is an ASCII stream-like channel. The
command-based interaction is done via the character device driver
we implemented and its read and write calls.</p><p>The actual mass transfer of data is done independently from
that: by sending a command like <b  >TOHOST
<i><tt>interface address</tt></i>,
<i><tt>length</tt></i>, <i><tt>host
address</tt></i></b>, the lab device will raise an
interrupt and tell the PC it wants to send a certain amount of data
to a given address at the host by DMA. But where should we put that
data? We decided not to mix up the clear character communication
with the mass data transfer. Moreover, as the user could even
upload its own commands to the device, we could make no assumptions
about the ordering and the meaning of the data.</p><p>So we decided to hand full control to the user and allow him
to request DMA-able memory portions mapped to the user address
space, and check every DMA request coming from the lab device
against the list of those areas. In other words, we implemented
something like a <b  >skel_malloc</b> and
<b  >skel_free</b> by means of <b  >ioctl()</b>
commands and disallowed any transfer to any other region in order
to keep the whole thing safe.</p><p>You might wonder why we did not use the direct
<b  >mmap()</b>. Mostly, because there is no equivalent
<b  >munmap</b>. Your driver will
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be notified when the mapping to the open
file is destroyed. Linux does it all by itself: it removes the vma
structure, destroys the page descriptor tables and decreases the
reference count for the shared pages.</p><p>As we have to allocate the DMA-able buffer by
<b  >kmalloc()</b>, we have to free it by
<b  >kfree()</b>. Linux won't allows us to do so when
automatically unmapping the user reference, but without the user
reference, we don't need the buffer any more. Therefore, we
implemented a <b  >skel_malloc()</b> which actually
allocates the driver buffer and remaps it to the user space as
well, and <b  >skel_free()</b> which release that space
and unmaps it (after checking if a DMA-transfer is running).</p><p>We could implement the remapping in the user library released
with our device driver by the same means used by the
<span   class="bold"><b>nasty</b></span> program above. But, for good
reason, /dev/mem can be read and written only by root, and programs
accessing the device driver should be able to run as normal user,
too.</p><p>Two tricks are used in our driver. First, we modify the
<b  >mem_map</b> array telling Linux about the usage and
permissions of our pages of physical memory.
<b  >mem_map</b> is an array of
<b  >mem_map_t</b> structures, and is used to keep
information about all the physical memory.</p><p>For all allocated pages we set the
<b  >reserved</b> flag. This is a quick and dirty method,
but it reaches its aim under all Linux versions (starting at least
at 1.2.x): Linux keeps its hands off our pages! It considers them
as if they were a video buffer, a ROM, or anything else it can't
swap or release into free memory. The <b  >mem_map</b>
array itself uses this trick to protect itself from processes
hungry for memory.</p><p>The second trick we use is quickly generating a pseudo file
which looks something like an opened /dev/mem. We rebuild the
<b  >mmap_mem()</b> call from the /dev/mem driver,
especially because it is not exported in the kernel symbol table
and simply apply the same small call to
<b  >remap_page_range()</b>.</p><p>Moreover, DMA-buffers allocated by our
<b  >skel_malloc()</b> call are registered in lists in
order to check whether a request for a DMA transfer is going to a
valid memory area. The lists are also used to free the allocated
buffers when the program closes the device without calling
<b  >skel_free()</b> beforehand.
<b  >dma_desc</b> is the type of those lists in the
following lines, which show the code for the
<b  >ioctl</b>-wrapped <b  >skel_malloc()</b>
and <b  >skel_free()</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

the old ISA world, peripherals located their buffers at the &ldquo;very
high end of address space&rdquo;--above 640 KB. Many PCI-cards now do
the same, but nowadays, this is something more like the end of a
32-bit address space (like 0xF0100000).</p><p>If you want to access a buffer at these addresses, you have
to use <b  >vremap()</b> as defined in linux/mm.h to
remap the same pages of this physical memory into your own virtual
address space.</p><p><b  >vremap()</b> works a little bit like the
<b  >mmap()</b> user call in nasty, but it's much
easier:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void * vremap (unsigned long offset,
               unsigned long size);
</pre><p>You just pass the start address of your buffer and its
length. Remember, we always map <span   class="emphasis"><em>pages</em></span>;
therefore <b  >offset</b> and <b  >size</b>
have to be page length-aligned. If your buffer is smaller or does
not start on a page boundary, map the whole page and try to avoid
accessing invalid addresses.</p><p>I personally have not tried this, and I'm not sure if the
tricks I described above on how to map buffers to user space work
with PCI high memory buffers. If you want to give it a try, you
definitely have to remove the &ldquo;brute force&rdquo; manipulation of the
<b  >mem_map</b> array, as <b  >mem_map</b> is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> for physical RAM. Try to replace the
<b  >kmalloc()</b> and <b  >kfree()</b> stuff
with the analogous <b  >vremap()</b> calls and then
perform a second remapping with <b  >do_mmap()</b> to
user space.</p><p>But as you might realize, we've come to an end of this
series, and now it is up to you to boldly go where no Linuxer has
gone before...</p><p>Good Luck!</p></div></div>
