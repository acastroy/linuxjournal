    Removing code from the kernel that provides unneeded support
    is one option long associated with Linux. Now, you can
    remove code that is not constantly required, putting it in
    modules loaded on command.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13ec580.0x14e44a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Like many operating systems, Linux offers
support for numerous devices, file systems, and network protocols.
Unfortunately, this growing support increases the memory
requirements of the kernel. Linux partially solves this problem by
allowing selection of only the features you need when compiling the
kernel. This is further improved by allowing some features to be
compiled as modules, so they can be loaded only when they are
needed. The loading and unloading of modules can be automated with
the use of kerneld, making the use of features compiled as modules
just as easy as using those included in the basic kernel.
</p><p>To use kerneld, you should start by installing the most
recent version of the modules package, found at
<a href="http://www.pi.se/blox/modules/" target="_self">www.pi.se/blox/modules/</a>.
I'm using modules-1.3.69f, but there's probably a newer version out
by the time you read this article. Also, you'll need a kernel at
least as recent as 1.3.57.</p><p>Fortunately, kerneld automatically knows about most modules.
All you must do is run it in your startup script. For
Slackware-based systems, you'll need to edit /etc/rc.d/rc.local.
You should include the following:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Update kernel-module dependencies file
[ -x /sbin/depmod ] &amp;&amp; {
        /sbin/depmod -a
}
# Start kerneld
[ -x /sbin/kerneld ] &amp;&amp; {
        /sbin/kerneld
}
</pre><p>For Red Hat systems, you can install the contributed modules
RPM on ftp.redhat.com in /pub/contrib/RPMS/ called
modules-1.3.57-3.i386.rpm which provides support for kerneld. A
newer version will probably be released by the time you read this,
so look for a later version of the modules utility if you can't
find it there. Alternately, read the article &ldquo;Understanding Red
Hat Runlevels&rdquo; in <i  >LJ</i> issue 27 (July 1996) and
create a kerneld boot script in /etc/init.d with appropriate links
in /etc/rc2.d, /etc/rc3.d, /etc/rc4.d, and /etc/rc5.d.</p><p>In either case, this runs depmod, which updates dependency
information used by kerneld and then starts kerneld, which forks
and hides in the background until the kernel needs it.</p><p>Now, all you need to do is reconfigure your kernel to use
modules for the features you're not always using, and build and
install the kernel and the modules. If you've never built modules
before, simply add two steps to the kernel compilation process:
<b  >make modules</b> and <b  >make
modules_install</b>.</p><p>When you boot the new kernel, you should have all your
modules loading automatically whenever you try to use them. The
command <b  >lsmod</b> will tell you which modules are
loaded. Of course, it is a good idea to keep your old kernel
bootable in case something doesn't work as expected.</p><p>Unfortunately, kerneld doesn't know about every module you
might want to install&mdash;particularly those not part of the kernel
distribution. To install these modules, you'll need to tell kerneld
about them in /etc/conf.modules. Kerneld needs to know both where
to find the module and what event triggers loading it.</p><p>I strongly recommend you use the default directories for your
modules. Otherwise, you'll have to add not only the new path to
/etc/conf.modules, but all the default paths as well. To see the
default paths, use <b  >modprobe -c | more</b>.</p><p>Telling kerneld what triggers the loading of a module
requires adding <b  >alias</b> entries in
/etc/conf.modules. For device drivers, such as zftape.o or
joystick.o, the format is based on the device type (character or
block) and major number. For example, I use <b  >alias
char-major-15 joystick</b> for the joystick driver. You can
get a bunch of examples by running <b  >modprobe -c</b>
to see the defaults. You can have multiple entries for the same
module if there are multiple events that should trigger loading
it.</p><p>You may also need to set an alias if you want to load an
optional module, like BSD compression with PPP. The simplest alias
to use for BSD compression is <b  >alias ppp
bsd_comp</b>. This will tell kerneld to load bsd_comp instead
of ppp, but since bsd_comp requires the real ppp module (which
requires slhc), it will load slhc and ppp first. Of course, if you
have trouble with this, you can always load the modules explicitly
in your dialing script and unload them in /etc/ppp/ip-down.</p><p>You can also use kerneld to set up a dial-on-demand network
connection. When the kernel receives a request to send a packet to
an IP address for which there is no routing information, it asks
kerneld if it can establish a route to that address. When kerneld
receives such a request, it runs /sbin/request-route, which should,
generally, be a script to start PPP or SLIP, thereby establishing a
route.</p><p>So, all you have to do is replace /sbin/request-route with
your dialing script. Well... not exactly. If you rely completely on
an outside nameserver, you can probably get away with that. In
general, however, you need to be careful, as kerneld may call
request-route several times, once for each IP address the kernel
needs to resolve. This can be solved by using a lock file for the
modem device, which is an option for chat and pppd. [You should be
using that option anyway!  &mdash;ED]</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13ec580.0x14e4d98"></a>What Should Be Compiled as a Module?</h2></div></div><p>When configuring your system, at first you may think it would
be best to compile everything as a module. This isn't always a good
idea, as it won't always save memory. Each module uses memory in 4K
pages, so the last page will generally have some space wasted.
Therefore, if you'll almost always have the module in use, you
might as well compile it into the kernel. Also, keep in mind that
kerneld itself consumes some memory (in my experience, at least 12
pages), so if you only have a few small modules to worry about, it
would be better to compile them into the kernel or load them
explicitly in the startup script.</p><p>Modules for file systems must be loaded as long as the file
system is mounted, even if you're not using it. So if you keep /dos
mounted all the time, don't bother to compile support for FAT as a
module. If you don't like that option, you could look into using an
automount daemon instead of keeping the file system mounted.</p><p>Be careful with modules that include information that may be
changed when run. For example, the sound driver keeps track of the
volume, and if you compile it as a module, the volume will be reset
to the default each time it is loaded.</p><p>Finally, be careful not to compile something as a module if
it will be used at boot time before kerneld is started. This
includes the root file system, of course. For many systems, you'll
find that you need both ELF and a.out support before kerneld
starts. You may be able to overcome some problems by installing
kerneld as one of the first programs executed by the startup
scripts, but be careful if you're also doing dial-on-demand, as you
may have something like sendmail in your startup scripts that will
trigger it. As long as you have your old kernel around as a safety
net, though, feel free to experiment.</p></div></div>
