Before you deploy DNSSEC for your zones, it helps to understand some of
the concepts and reasoning behind DNSSEC.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c8d580.0x1d853b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Like IPv6, DNSSEC is one of those great forward-looking protocols that
unfortunately hasn't seen wide adoption yet. Before I implemented it myself, I
could see why. Although some people think BIND itself is difficult to set up, DNSSEC
adds an extra layer of keys, key management and a slew of additional DNS
records. One day I decided to set up DNSSEC on a personal zone to familiarize
myself with the concepts and process, and it turns out that the implementation isn't all
that bad once you grasp a few concepts. In this article, I cover some of the
general concepts, and in my next article, I'll describe the steps for using
DNSSEC on your own zone.

How DNS Works</h2></div></div><p>
It can be difficult to understand how DNSSEC works if you don't completely grasp
how DNS itself works. Really, I could spend a whole article just talking about how
DNS works, but for the purposes of this article, here's a very
high-level trace of a typical uncached DNS query that resolves a domain of mine:
www.greenfly.org. When you type a URL in a Web browser and press Enter, behind the
scenes, the OS starts a process to convert that hostname into an IP address.
Although
some people run DNS caching services on their personal computers, for the most
part, you rely on an external DNS server you've either configured by hand or via
DHCP. When your OS needs to convert a hostname into an IP, it sends a DNS query
to a name server defined in /etc/resolv.conf (these days, if this file is managed
by resolvconf, the real name servers can be trickier to track down). This starts
what's known as a recursive query, as this remote DNS server acts on your behalf
to talk to any other DNS servers it needs to contact to resolve your hostname to
an IP.
</p><p>
In the case of resolving www.greenfly.org, the recursive DNS server starts by
sending a query to one of the 13 root DNS servers on the Internet
(192.33.4.12), asking for the IP for www.greenfly.org. The root name servers reply
that they don't know that information, but the name servers for .org might know,
and here are their names and IP addresses. Next, the recursive DNS server sends a
query to one of the .org name servers (199.19.54.1), asking the same question. The
.org name server replies that it also doesn't know the answer, but the name
servers for greenfly.org might know, and here are their names and IP addresses.
Finally, the recursive DNS server asks one of the greenfly.org name servers
(75.101.46.232) and gets back the answer that www.greenfly.org is at
64.142.56.172.
</p><p>
If you are curious how this might work for a domain you own, just use the
<tt  >dig</tt>
command with the <tt  >+trace</tt> option. Here's example output for www.greenfly.org:

Although this may seem like a lot of steps, in practice, name servers cache answers
for a period of time known as the TTL, or Time To Live, that's assigned to every
record. That way, a DNS resolver has to look up only any records that have
expired.

DNS Security Issues</h2></div></div><p>
DNS has been around for quite a while, and it has had its share of security issues
over time. DNS is designed to be an open, friendly service. Although some
administrators might treat DNS records as secrets, generally speaking, a DNS
record's purpose is to be looked up by anyone who requests it, so DNS records are
not encrypted, and DNS queries generally occur over plain text. Here are a few DNS
security issues facing us today:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Domain names sometimes look alike (google.com vs. googIe.com), which an attacker
can take advantage of to encourage you to click on a legitimate-looking link.
</p></li><li><p>
Companies can't always register their name on all TLDs (.com vs. .biz vs. .net),
so an attacker might register mybank.biz, which a victim may think is
legitimate.
</p></li><li><p>
Many DNS servers (known as open resolvers) will perform recursive queries for
anyone who asks.
</p></li><li><p>
Open resolvers commonly are used in modern DNS amplification DDOS attacks (an
attack where a relatively small DNS query results in an orders of magnitude
larger response that, due to DNS queries occurring over UDP, can be redirected
to a different target than the host who initiated the request). With a DNS
amplification attack, it takes much less bandwidth from an attacking machine to
generate large amounts of traffic for a target.
</p></li><li><p>
DNS is subject to MitM (Man in the Middle) attacks where DNS records can be
rewritten before they get back to the victim. This lets an attacker, for
instance, change the IP of yourbank.com in a DNS request to point to the
Web site the attacker controls instead.
</p></li><li><p>
DNS spoofing/cache poisoning attacks (this class of attacks was covered by a
series of Paranoid Penguin columns in 2011) essentially allow an
attacker to inject fake DNS records into a DNS resolver's cache to point
victims, again, at an attacker's site instead of the site they intend to visit.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Of all of these different DNS security issues, DNSSEC attempts to address the
last two, MitM attacks and DNS cache poisoning, by signing every DNS reply with a
signature, much like a PGP signature in an e-mail. The DNSSEC signature verifies
that the DNS result you see came from the authoritative DNS server for that
domain and that it wasn't tampered with in any way in transit.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c8d580.0x1d85f60"></a>
How DNSSEC Works</h2></div></div><p>
If you are somewhat familiar with the CA (Certificate Authority) system or with
how public-key cryptography works with PGP-signed e-mails, understanding 
DNSSEC will be a bit simpler, as it has some similarities. With DNSSEC, a domain
creates a set of public and private keys that it uses to sign every record set in its
zone. The domain then publishes the public keys in the zone as a record of its
own along with the signatures. With these public keys and signatures, anyone
performing a DNS query against that domain can use the public key to validate the
signature for a particular record. Because only someone with the private key could
sign the record, you can be assured the result was signed by someone who controls
the domain. If someone tampered with the record along the way, the signature
no longer would match.
</p><p>
Like with PGP-signed e-mail, having cryptographic signatures attached to a
document isn't a sufficient reason to trust the document. After all,
attackers 
simply could generate a different key pair, change the record and attach
their public
key and updated signature instead. With DNSSEC, you need an outside mechanism to
know you can trust that the public key you are getting truly came from the
domain. With PGP-signed e-mail, you validate the public key with outside
mechanisms, such as key-signing parties, with the hope that if you receive an e-mail
from someone for which you don't immediately have a public key signature, someone you
already trust does, and you can use that chain of trust to validate the
signature. I don't know of any DNSSEC key-signing parties; instead,
the chain of trust is built much like how it is with the CA system.
</p><p>
When you visit a site that's protected by HTTPS, the site will present you with a
copy of its public key (here called a certificate), so you can establish
a secure, encrypted communication channel with the site, but equally important,
you also can validate that you are in fact communicating with, for instance,
mail.google.com and not some attacker. Because you probably didn't go to a Google
key-signing party either, how can you trust that certificate? It turns out that
each certificate is signed by a CA like Verisign, Thawte
or a large number of others. This signature is attached to the certificate you
receive, and your browser itself has public keys for each of the CAs built in to
it. The browser implicitly trusts these CA certificates, so if you receive a
certificate from a site that has been signed by any of these CAs, you will trust
it as valid. This trust, by the way, is why it is such a problem when a CA gets
hacked. Attackers then can use the private keys from that CA to generate new
certificates for any site they want to impersonate and browsers 
will trust them automatically.
</p><p>
DNSSEC signatures follow a similar chain of trust to PGP keys and CAs. In this
case, the root DNS servers act as the trust anchor, and DNSSEC resolvers implicitly
trust what the root DNS servers sign, much like browsers trust CAs. When a TLD
(Top Level Domain) wants to implement DNSSEC, it submits a special DS record to
the root DNS servers to sign. Those DS records contain a signature for the
subdomain generated by the private key. The root DNS server hosts that DS record
and signs it with its private key. In that way, because you trust root, you can
trust that the signature for org has not been modified; therefore, you can
trust it as well in the same way you would trust a certificate signed by a CA.
Then if you want to enable DNSSEC for a .org domain, for instance, you would
submit a DS record for each key through your registrar if it supports DNSSEC.
Each DS record contains a key's signature for your domain that the org name
servers then would sign and host.
</p><p>
In this model, the chain of trust basically follows the same order that a
recursive DNS query like I outlined above would follow. A DNSSEC query adds an
extra validation step to each part of the process. For instance, a query for
www.isc.org starts at the root, uses the DS record for org to validate com
signatures, then uses the DS record for isc.org to validate the isc.org signature
attached to www.isc.org. You can add the <tt  >+dnssec</tt> option to
<tt  >dig +trace</tt> to see the
full transaction:

RRSET: a complete set of Resource Records. For instance, an RRSET might be all
NS records or A records for a particular name.
</p></li><li><p>
KSK (Key-Signing Key): signs DNSKEY records in a zone.
</p></li><li><p>
ZSK (Zone-Signing Key): signs all of the other records in a zone.
</p></li><li><p>
SEP (Secure Entry Point): a flag set in a key to denote it as a KSK.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
While best practice dictates a separate KSK and ZSK, it isn't an actual
requirement. In my next article on DNSSEC implementation, I will discuss the main
differences between the two key types and why separate keys is considered a best
practice.

New DNSSEC Record Types</h2></div></div><p>
DNSSEC also has introduced a number of new DNS record types into the mix. These
records are published with the zone along with the rest of your DNS records and
are pulled down as needed by any DNSSEC-enabled query:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
DNSKEY: this is a public key for the zone and can either be a KSK or ZSK.
</p></li><li><p>
RRSIG (Resource Record Signature): this record contains a signature for an RRSET
created with a particular ZSK.
</p></li><li><p>
NSEC (Next Secure record): these records are used in &ldquo;negative
answers&rdquo; to
prove whether a name exists.
</p></li><li><p>
NSEC3 (Next Secure version 3): these records are like NSEC, but protect
against &ldquo;zone walking&rdquo; where an outside user could use NSEC records to walk
down the zone and discover all of the records in the zone (much like being able
to perform a zone transfer).
</p></li><li><p>
DS (Delegation Signer): this record contains a KSK signature and is submitted
to the zone's parent where it is signed and is used as part of a chain of trust.
</p></li><li><p>
DLV (DNSSEC Look-aside Validation): much like DS records, but are used when DS
records are not supported by a zone, or as an alternate trust anchor if your
registrar doesn't support DNSSEC.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1c8d580.0x2312718"></a>
DNSSEC Look-Aside Validation</h2></div></div><p>
DNSSEC has a sort of chicken-and-egg problem. If your TLD does not support
DNSSEC, any outside resolvers won't have a complete chain of trust from root,
through the TLD, to your zone. There also may be a case where your TLD does
support DNSSEC, but your registrar doesn't provide a mechanism to upload a DS
record to the TLD (most registrars sadly don't). In either case, DNSSEC
Look-aside Validation (DLV) has been created to provide an alternate trust
anchor.
</p><p>
You can find more
details on DLV at <a href="http://dlv.isc.org" target="_self">dlv.isc.org</a> (one of the main DLV
providers), but essentially, instead of generating a DS record to submit to a TLD,
you generate a special DLV record and submit it to a DLV server. As long as a DNS
resolver is configured to trust, for instance, dlv.isc.org, it can use that to
anchor the chain of trust and then trust your signed records.
</p><p>
It turns out DNSSEC has a lot of new concepts to understand before you even get
to implementing it; however, the implementation isn't all that
bad once you see the steps laid out, so be sure to follow up with my article next month
when I talk about how to implement DNSSEC for a zone using BIND. I'll even cover
how to set up DLV for the zone.
