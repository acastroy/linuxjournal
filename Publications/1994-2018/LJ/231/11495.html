Chromebook: frivolous toy or useful tool? Bill breaks it down for you.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x23301f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Back in late 2010, Google announced a &ldquo;Chromebook&rdquo;&mdash;a low-cost,
entry-level netbook that would run Google's own operating system,
ChromeOS. Google's vision of ChromeOS, although based on Linux, 
basically would be a giant Web browser, with all the apps on the machine running
in the browser. ChromeOS would be a nearly stateless computer, with all
the user's apps based in Google's cloud, running the Google Apps suite.
</p><p>
Google's first stab at this was the CR-48: an Intel Atom-powered netbook
with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of Flash. The CR-48 wasn't a powerhouse by any
means, but it had a couple cool things going for it. First, it came
with 100MB of free 3G service a month. Second, it had a &ldquo;developer
mode&rdquo;
that allowed users to break free of the strict Chrome-based browser
jail and expose the chewy Linux center. A CR-48 in developer mode became
a usable machine for a lot of people, because the machine pretty much
became a small Linux laptop.

Today&mdash;the Samsung ARM Chromebook</h2></div></div><p>
Fast-forward a couple years, and the first real Chromebook products are
hitting the market. Quite a few Chromebooks exist today,
but all of them are Intel-based (either Atom or Celeron). In late 2012,
however, Samsung released an ARM-based Chromebook. This little guy is
different in lots of ways&mdash;primarily, it beats its bigger brothers in
size and battery life, without compromising much on performance. Speaking
of performance, let's go over the specifications of the XE303&mdash;the
first non-Intel powered Chromebook:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Dual-Core, Samsung Exynos 5 ARM CPU (Cortex A15, 1.7GHz).
</p></li><li><p>
2GB of RAM (not upgradable, soldered to the mainboard).
</p></li><li><p>
16GB SSD/Flash-based disk (also not upgradable, soldered to the mainboard).
</p></li><li><p>
ARM Mali T-604 Quad-Core GPU.
</p></li><li><p>
Wi-Fi (802.11 a/b/g/n).
</p></li><li><p>
Bluetooth 3.0 (sadly, no Bluetooth 4.0 here).
</p></li><li><p>
11" LCD screen at 1366x768 resolution.
</p></li><li><p>
One USB 2.0 port, one USB 3.0 port, one HDMI-out port and one SD card slot.
</p></li><li><p>
Optional 3G modem (CDMA, on the Verizon network in the US, equipped
 on this model).
</p></li><li><p>
6.5 hours of (rated) battery life.
</p></li><li><p>
Dimensions: 2.4 lbs (1.10 kg), 11.4" x 8.2" x 0.68" (289.6 x 208.5 x 17.5mm).
</p></li><li><p>
Bonus: 100GB of Google Drive included for two years.
</p></li><li><p>
Bonus: 100MB/month of Verizon 3G service included for two years (3G model only).
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11495f1.large.jpg"><img src="11495f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Looking at the specifications individually, they aren't
mind-blowing. However, when you put them together in a $329 computer
($249 if you get the non-3G version), that's something different
altogether. This is a functioning computer&mdash;with a keyboard&mdash;that is playing in the tablet price-point and space. The keyboard is
actually quite good for a machine of this size. Compared to other
netbook-class machines I've owned, this keyboard is far and away the
best I've used amongst low-end hardware. The display isn't outstanding,
but it's serviceable and does the job. The build quality is quite good,
although the unit is built from plastic&mdash;there's no metal in it&mdash;keeping
the price point down where it needs to be. The unit doesn't creak, pop
or feel cheap, despite the fact that it's one of the least expensive
computers I've owned.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11495f2.large.jpg"><img src="11495f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Surprisingly enough, the little dual-core ARM CPU does a great job of
keeping things running&mdash;and running silently, as there's no hard disk
or fans to make noise in this little guy. The Chromebook had no problems
playing 720p video streams from Netflix (where the Google and Netflix
wizards have HTML5 streaming running for the Chromebook without needing
anything but the Chrome browser). The Chromebook also performed just fine
while watching H264-encoded video streaming via Apache off a machine
on my local network, and it did it while maintaining its advertised
battery life of 6.5 hours. But, it's running something that's not a
&ldquo;real OS&rdquo;&mdash;ChromeOS. Is ChromeOS usable?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x2331430"></a>
Getting Down and Dirty with ChromeOS</h2></div></div><p>
From a basic user standpoint, ChromeOS is actually a good thing. It
comes with an &ldquo;office suite&rdquo; included in the price of the machine, is
virus-/malware-resistant out of the box and is easy to update. ChromeOS
on the Chromebook boots to a user-login screen in about eight seconds,
which is plenty fast for the average user. It's basically a Google Apps appliance,
and when you think of the Chromebook within that frame of reference,
it's a really nice little machine.
</p><p>
I loaned the Chromebook to my ten-year old son, who knows just enough
about computers to be dangerous. In no time flat, he was surfing the
Web, and he discovered you didn't need a Netflix &ldquo;app&rdquo; to watch Netflix
movies on the Chromebook. If you're looking for a Web-surfing machine,
the Chromebook more than fills that particular need.
</p><p>
In all, for most of the tasks an &ldquo;average&rdquo; user would do, this little
Chromebook is a decent portable machine, so long as that user has a full-fledged
desktop somewhere&mdash;and is comfortable with the Google Apps
suite. However, power users (the readers of this magazine) will find the
&ldquo;jail&rdquo; of ChromeOS to be limiting. However, that jail can be broken.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x2331748"></a>
Power-User Time: Hacking the Chromebook</h2></div></div><p>
As mentioned previously, it was possible to put the old CR-48 Chromebook
prototype into &ldquo;developer mode&rdquo; and extend its capabilities through
various hacks. Thanks to Google and Samsung for retaining this ability
on the new ARM-based Chromebook, as it's necessary to hack the unit.
</p><p>
There are a couple different ways to extend the Chromebook to run
a full Linux environment, but I think the most flexible and easiest
to install is an Ubuntu chroot environment, using the Crouton script
by David Schneider (an engineer at Google). Crouton is the best thing
since sliced bread&mdash;it makes it easy to install Ubuntu's ARM port
in a chroot on the Chromebook's filesystem. Although it's possible to
repartition and reformat the Chromebook's disk (see the Another Way to Hack the
Chromebook sidebar for
more information), doing that brings its own set of risks and challenges. By
keeping ChromeOS on the machine, and installing Ubuntu in a chroot,
you can let ChromeOS handle the power management, networking and other
hardware-related tasks. Going with a chroot-based install also lets you
install multiple chroots side by side, play with them and delete them
with impunity if you don't like the way they're behaving.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2238580.0x2331958"></a>
Getting Started with Crouton</h2></div></div><p>
First, please refer to the links provided in the
Resources section of this article, and back up any data you have on your
Chromebook. The tools and methods described here may change between
the time of this writing and press time, so please, ensure that you're following the
latest set of instructions.
</p><p>
Now that you're all caught up, start by putting your Chromebook into
developer mode. This is done by starting the Chromebook in
&ldquo;Recovery&rdquo;
mode first: hold the Esc and Refresh keys down while turning on the system.
Once the &ldquo;Recovery&rdquo; screen appears, invoke developer mode by pushing
Ctrl-D (there's no prompt, you have to know the magic sequence). The
system will ask you to confirm, and then it will wipe its internal disk,
finally rebooting into developer mode. As a consequence, the system 
always will show an &ldquo;OS verification is off&rdquo; screen on power-up, and you'll
need to press Ctrl-D to clear that boot screen.
</p><p>
Once the Chromebook is booted in developer mode, open the Chrome browser
and go to the Crouton download URL: <a href="http://goo.gl/fd3zc" target="_self">goo.gl/fd3zc</a>. The Crouton
script will download automatically in your Downloads directory on the
Chromebook.
</p><p>
Now that you've got the Crouton script on your Chromebook, you need to
launch it. Start a crosh shell (Chrome Shell) in the Chrome browser
by pushing Ctrl-Alt-T, then type <tt  >shell</tt> and press Enter.
You're almost
ready to make your first chroot. Crouton has the concept of
&ldquo;targets&rdquo;
as install definitions. If you want an Xfce-equipped system, you can
install with the <tt  >-t xfce</tt> target. Because you're
installing Ubuntu here, you may
as well try out a full-blown Ubuntu&mdash;let's install Unity. Do that
by running Crouton with the following command from the crosh shell:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -t unity
</pre>
</p><p>
Crouton will prompt you along the way, asking questions, such as
user name and password, and it'll download all the necessary files to
build the chroot. Then, it'll go and do the heavy lifting of actually
building and installing the chroot.

Figure 3. Running a Ubuntu chroot in a Shell alongside ChromeOS
</p></div></div><p>
Once it's all done (how long it takes depends on your Internet
download speed, because Crouton downloads all its bits from the Ubuntu
mirrors), you can start your Ubuntu session from crosh simply by running
<tt  >sudo enter-chroot</tt>. If you want to start Unity, once you're in your
chroot, just run <tt  >startunity</tt>, and Unity will start on a second virtual
terminal. You then can flip between Unity and ChromeOS by pressing
Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Forward or Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Backward. (The &ldquo;Forward&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Backward&rdquo; keys are special Chromebook keys, about where F1 and F2 would
be on a normal PC's keyboard.) You also can install any other software
<span   class="emphasis"><em>inside</em></span> your new chroot, simply by using Ubuntu's Software Manager,
apt-get or your favorite Debian package installer.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11495f4.large.jpg"><img src="11495f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Ubuntu Running on the Chromebook
</p></div></div><p>
There are other versions of Crouton, in the event that Ubuntu's not your
speed (see the Resources section for a port of Crouton that installs Arch
Linux). Don't forget, if you want to experiment, or have more than one
chroot for different reasons, you can. Simply install with your desired
target(s) and name them differently with Crouton's <tt  >-n</tt>
option.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The Chromebook, out of the box, isn't exactly the most usable of machines
for most <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers. It's geared more for the basic or
novice user, particularly one who's already using the Google Apps suite
of products. However, once the Chromebook is extended in developer mode
and has a full Linux chroot on it, it's an extremely good mobile companion&mdash;particularly for the price. Its long battery life, light weight and
silent operation lend itself well to working just about anywhere. If you
decide to put up the money and get the 3G model, you should factor the two
years of free 3G and Google Drive into the equation too. Google Drive
and 100MB of Verizon 3G would be priced at about $15 a month, or $360
for two years. With the 3G model going for $329, this is indeed a bargain.
</p><p>
If you're looking for an inexpensive, highly portable, Linux computer&mdash;and
you don't mind hacking on it a little bit&mdash;check out the
Samsung ARM Chromebook.

Another Way to Hack the Chromebook</b></p><p>
If a Linux chroot doesn't appeal to you, and you want to excise all
signs of ChromeOS from your Chromebook, there's a way to do that. The
ChrUbuntu project (linked to in the Resources section) has a script
that will allow you to repartition your Chromebook to install and run
Ubuntu natively in a dual-boot configuration&mdash;or wipe your Chromebook
and run Ubuntu as the sole OS. There's also an option to run Ubuntu off
of an external disk (SD card or USB stick), if you choose. However you
wish to extend your Chromebook, you have many options.
