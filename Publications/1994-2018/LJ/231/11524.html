Create Web applications simply with Clojure, a modern Lisp.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce4580.0xddc3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Lisp is one of those languages that people either love or hate. Count me
among the Lisp lovers. I was brainwashed during my undergraduate
studies at MIT to believe that Lisp is the only &ldquo;real&rdquo; programming
language out there, and that anything else is a pale imitation. True,
I use Python and Ruby in my day-to-day work, but I often wish I
had the chance to work with Lisp on a regular basis.
</p><p>
One window of opportunity to do exactly that has opened in the past few
years. Clojure, a modern variant of Lisp that runs on the Java virtual
machine (JVM), has been taking the programming world by storm. It's a
real Lisp, which means that it has all of the goodness you would
want and expect: functional programming paradigms, easy use of complex
data structures and even such advanced facilities as macros. Unlike
other Lisps, and contributing in no small part to its success, Clojure
sits on top of the JVM, meaning that it can interoperate with Java
objects and also work in many existing environments.
</p><p>
In this article, I want to share some of my experiences with starting to
experiment with Clojure for Web development. Although I don't foresee
using Clojure in much of my professional work, I do believe it's
useful and important always to be trying new languages, frameworks
and paradigms. Clojure combines Lisp and the JVM in just the right
quantities to make it somewhat mainstream, which makes it more
interesting than just a cool language that no one is really using for
anything practical.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce4580.0xddc6c8"></a>
Clojure Basics</h2></div></div><p>
Clojure, as I mentioned above, is a version of Lisp that's based on the
JVM. This means if you're going to run Clojure programs, you're
also going to need a copy of Java. Fortunately, that's not much of an
issue nowadays, given Java's popularity. Clojure itself comes as a
Java archive (JAR) file, which you then can execute.
</p><p>
But, given the number of Clojure packages and libraries you'll
likely want to use, you would be better off using Leiningen, a
package manager for installing Clojure and
Clojure-related packages. (The name is from a story, &ldquo;Leiningen and
the Ants&rdquo;, and is an indication of how the Clojure community doesn't
want to use the established dependency-management system, Ant.) You
definitely will want to install Leiningen. If your Linux distribution
doesn't include a modern copy already, you can download the shell
script from 
<a href="https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein" target="_self">https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein</a>.
</p><p>
Execute this shell script, putting it in your PATH. After you download
the Leiningen jarfile, it will download and install Leiningen
in your ~/.lein directory (also known as LEIN_HOME). That's all you
need in order to start creating a Clojure Web application.
</p><p>
With Leiningen installed, you can create a Web application. But in
order to do that, you'll need to decide which framework to use.
Typically, you create a new Clojure project with <tt  >lein new</tt>, either
naming the project on which you want to work (<tt  >lein new
myproject</tt>),
or by naming the template you wish to copy and then the name of the
project (<tt  >lein new mytemplate myproject</tt>). You can get a list of
existing templates by executing <tt  >lein help new</tt> or by looking at the
<a href="https://clojars.org" target="_self">https://clojars.org</a> site, a repository for Clojure jarfiles and libraries.
</p><p>
You also can open an REPL (read-eval-print loop) in order to
communicate directly with Clojure. I'm not going to go into all the 
details here, but Clojure supports all the basic data types you
would expect, some of which are mapped to Java classes. Clojure
supports integers and strings, lists and vectors, maps (that is,
dictionaries or hashes) and sets. And like all Lisps, Clojure
indicates that you want to evaluate (that is, run) code by putting it
inside parentheses and putting the function name first. Thus, you can
say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(println "Hello")
(println (str "Hello," " " "Reuven"))
(println (str (+ 3 5)))
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can assign variables in Clojure. One of the important things
to know about Clojure is that all data is immutable. This is somewhat
familiar territory for Python programmers, who are used to having some
immutable data types (for example, strings and tuples) in the language. In
Clojure, all data is immutable, which means that in order to
&ldquo;change&rdquo;
a string, list, vector or any other data type, you really
must reassign the same variable to a new piece of data. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user=&gt; (def person "Reuven")
#'user/person

user=&gt; (def person (str person " Lerner"))
#'user/person

user=&gt; person
"Reuven Lerner"
</pre>
</p><p>
Although it might seem strange to have all data be immutable, this tends
to reduce or remove a large number of concurrency problems. It 
also is surprisingly natural to work with given the number of functions
in Clojure that transform existing data and the ability to use
&ldquo;def&rdquo;
to define things.
</p><p>
You also can create maps, which are Clojure's implementation of hashes
or dictionaries:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user=&gt; (def m {:a 1 :b 2})
#'user/m

user=&gt; (get m :a)
1

user=&gt; (get m :x)
nil
</pre>
</p><p>
You can get the value associated with the key &ldquo;x&rdquo;, or a default if
you
prefer not to get nil back:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user=&gt; (get m :x "None")
"None"
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember, you can't change your map, because data in Clojure is
immutable. However, you can add it to another map, the values of which
will override yours:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user=&gt; (assoc m :a 100)
{:a 100, :b 2}
</pre>
</p><p>
One final thing I should point out before diving in is that you
can (of course) create functions in Clojure. You can create an
anonymous function with <tt  >fn</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(fn [first second] (+ first second))
</pre>
</p><p>
The above defines a new function that takes two parameters and adds
them together. However, it's usually nice to put these into a named
function, which you can do with <tt  >def</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user=&gt; (def add (fn [first second] (+ first second)))
#'user/add

user=&gt; (add 5 3)
8
</pre>
</p><p>
Because this is common, you also can use the <tt  >defn</tt> macro, which
combines <tt  >def</tt> and <tt  >fn</tt> together:

<pre     class="programlisting">
user=&gt; (add 5 3)
8

user=&gt; (defn  add [first second] (+ first second))
#'user/add

user=&gt; (add 5 3)
8
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce4580.0xddd430"></a>
Web Development</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have seen the basics of Clojure, let's consider what is
involved in Web development. You need to have an HTTP server that will
accept requests, as well as a program (typically known as a &ldquo;router&rdquo;)
that decides which functions will be executed for each requested URL.
Then, you want to return data to the user, typically in the form of
HTML files.
</p><p>
Now, various Web application frameworks approach this problem
differently. In the most primitive ones (for example, CGI programs), the
&ldquo;application&rdquo; really is invoked only on a single program. Large
frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails, handle all of these parts and even
allow you to swap parts out&mdash;and each of those parts is done using
instances of different classes that handle the appropriate
information.
</p><p>
Now, although Clojure is built on top of the JVM and uses some of the
primitive Java classes as its fundamental data types, it is not an
object-oriented language. Clojure is a functional language, which
means that all of the aforementioned steps will be handled using
functions&mdash;either those that you define or those that have been
defined for you by a Web framework.
</p><p>
For the purposes of this article, I'm going to use Compojure, a simple Web
framework for Clojure. To create a basic Compojure project, you can
use Leiningen:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lein new compojure cjtest
</pre>
</p><p>
This potentially will download a number of libraries from clojars (the
Clojure library repository), then the new Clojure project (&ldquo;cjtest&rdquo;).
Once that is done, you can run it by going into the cjtest
directory and executing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lein ring server
</pre>
</p><p>
This will download and install whatever dependencies exist, and it then will
start a simple HTTP server, by default on port 3000. You 
then can visit this simple application at http://localhost:3000, where
you'll be greeted by &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; from Compojure.
</p><p>
Now, how does this work? How does Compojure know what to do?
</p><p>
The answer is in the Clojure project file (project.clj). The default,
generic Compojure project is defined using (of course!) Lisp code.
Indeed, it's pretty standard in the Lisp world to use Lisp code as
data. The default project created for me by Leiningen looks like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(defproject cjtest "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]
                 [compojure "1.1.5"]]
  :plugins [[lein-ring "0.8.5"]]
  :ring {:handler cjtest.handler/app}
  :profiles
  {:dev {:dependencies [[ring-mock "0.1.5"]]}})
</pre>
</p><p>
This uses Clojure's <tt  >defproject</tt> macro, giving it a name
&ldquo;cjtest&rdquo; and
a version number. Then there are several keywords, a Clojure data type
used as (among other things) the keys in maps. Thus, the above example shows 
Clojure that the program has the default description, and it depends
on both Clojure and Compojure (and specifies the versions of each).
</p><p>
A second configuration file, also written in Lisp code, sits within
the src/cjtest directory and is called handler.clj. The default
looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(ns cjtest.handler
  (:use compojure.core)
  (:require [compojure.handler :as handler]
            [compojure.route :as route]))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Hello World")
  (route/resources "/")
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))

(def app
  (handler/site app-routes))
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, if someone requests &ldquo;/&rdquo;, it will return &ldquo;Hello
World&rdquo;.
You then add a route for any static resources you might want to
server, which should be in the resources directory of your Clojure
project. You then add a not-found route for handling 404 errors.
</p><p>
You can run this amazing new Web application with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lein ring server
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're wondering what &ldquo;ring&rdquo; is doing there, suffice it to say that
Ring is the Clojure library that handles just about all Web-related
activity. It's a low-level library, however, and it doesn't function as
an actual Web application framework. It uses the standard Jetty system
for Java Web applications, although you don't need to worry about that
at this stage, given the automation that Leiningen provides; any
missing libraries or dependencies will be downloaded when you run
Ring.
</p><p>
Sure enough, after running the above, if you go to /, you get a
&ldquo;Hello world&rdquo; message back from the server, because you had mapped
<tt  >GET
/</tt> to a string. If you want, you instead can map it to a function by
having square brackets following the route name, and then adding a
function body:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Hello World")
  (GET "/fancy/:name" [name]
       (str "Hello, " name))
  (route/resources "/")
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))
</pre>
</p><p>
You even can add HTML tags for some formatting:

<pre     class="programlisting">

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Hello World")
  (GET "/fancy/:name" [name]
       (str "&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt;, " name "&lt;p&gt;"))
  (route/resources "/")
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how in Lisp, because of the prefix syntax, you don't need to use
+ or any other operator to create a string from three (or any number)
parts. You just add additional parameters, separated by spaces, and
they are added to the new string that <tt  >str</tt> returns.
</p><p>
If you don't want to have your function inline, you always
can define it elsewhere and then pass it to <tt  >defroutes</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(defn say-hello
  [req]
  (str "&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hello&lt;/b&gt;, " 
  &#8618;(get (get req :route-params) :name) "&lt;p&gt;"))

(defroutes app-routes
  (GET "/" [] "Hello World")
  (GET "/fancy/:name" [name] say-hello)
  (route/resources "/")
  (route/not-found "Not Found"))
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how this function, <tt  >say-hello</tt>, takes a single argument (called
<tt  >req</tt>), a map of maps that contains all the data having to do with
the HTTP request you received. If you want to grab the
<tt  >name</tt> parameter
that was defined in the route, you have to get it from the
<tt  >route-params</tt> map inside the <tt  >req</tt> map
that your function is
passed. You probably will want to explore the <tt  >req</tt> object to
understand just what Compojure is passing and how to work with such
data.

Getting Fancier</h2></div></div><p>
Now, Compojure advertises itself as a routing mechanism for Web
applications. This raises the question of what sorts of templates
Compojure brings to the table. And, the answer is none. That's
right, Compojure itself expects you to return strings containing HTML,
but how you make those strings is up to you.
</p><p>
Thus, you can create strings, as shown above, in order to return a
value. Or, you can use a templating engine, which in the Clojure
world, simply means including another dependency and using the
functions defined by that dependency:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(defproject cjtest "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "FIXME: write description"
  :url "http://example.com/FIXME"
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]
                 [compojure "1.1.5"]
                 [hiccup "1.0.3"]]
  :plugins [[lein-ring "0.8.5"]]
  :ring {:handler cjtest.handler/app}
  :profiles
  {:dev {:dependencies [[ring-mock "0.1.5"]]}})
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, within the handler.clj file, you need to make another change, so
that you can have access to the &ldquo;hiccup&rdquo; HTML-generation system:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(ns cjtest.handler
  (:use compojure.core hiccup.core)
  (:require [compojure.handler :as handler]
            [compojure.route :as route]))
</pre>
</p><p>
With these in place, you now can create HTML by using a function and
Clojure's vector syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(defn say-hello
  [req]
  (html [:p [:b "Hello, "  
  &#8618;(get (get req :route-params) :name) ]]))
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, if you look at the parentheses and say, &ldquo;Yikes, that's what I
dislike about Lisp&rdquo;, I'll understand. But if you look at this as
Lisp code and realize that this means your templates automatically
are valid HTML if they are valid Lisp, you're thinking in the terms
that Clojure wants to encourage&mdash;that is, using Lisp data structures
as much as possible and feeding them to functions that know how to work
with them.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
As you can see, Clojure provides the simplicity of Lisp's structure and
syntax while staying within the world of Java and the JVM. My next article will
look a bit deeper at Compojure, investigating forms,
database connectivity and other issues that modern Web applications
want to use.
