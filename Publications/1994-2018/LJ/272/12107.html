This article continues the series begun last month by getting two Raspberry
Pis to communicate over a 6LoWPAN network. It looks at how to make
them talk to other IPv6 hosts on different network segments,
necessary to get IoT data off the sensors and onto the internet.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b91f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the first article in this series (in the November 2016 issue), I described how to configure two Raspberry Pis to talk using the
low power wireless protocol 6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4 with the OpenLabs wireless
module. As an example, I showed Python code running a server on one RPi to deliver CPU temperature data
to a client on another.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b9300"></a>
What's Next?</h2></div></div><p>
But, that isn't the real point of using 6LoWPAN. You could have done the
same thing using
Zigbee, Bluetooth Low Energy, Z-Wave or some other low power networking system. The point
of using 6LoWPAN is that it creates and sends IPv6 packets. This potentially brings it
into the wider internet world where IP packets can be routed across multiple hosts
without having to decode and re-code the packets.
</p><p>
The 6LoWPAN network generates IPv6 packets. The internet is very slowly moving across
to IPv6, but much of it is still IPv4. If you have to deal with an IPv4 network,
these are your choices:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Decode the packets on the RPi and use the data in them to talk to IPv4 hosts
thereafter. That's what you could have done after following along with the first
article in this series&mdash;you had decoded a
packet and then could manipulate it or send it on.
</p></li><li><p>
Tunnel across the IPv4 network to another IPv6 network and carry on from there.
</p></li><li><p>
Use NAT'ing techniques to convert IPv6 packets into IPv4 packets automatically. This
isn't easy and is beyond the scope of this article. (If you are interested, look up NAT64.)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I'm going to assume you can continue to use IPv6, so the RPi is in an IPv6 6LoWPAN
network on one side and an IPv6 Ethernet/Wi-Fi network on the other.
</p><p>
This article looks at how to get IPv6 packets from a 6LoWPAN network and route them
into an IPv6 network (and of course, back the other way). As in the first article, if
you're following along, you
will use Raspberry Pis with the same OpenLabs modules. And just like in the first
article, there are a number of problems to be resolved along the way.
</p><p>
The goal is to get suitable IPv6 addresses generated on all the 6LoWPAN devices and
for one of these devices to act as a router (an &ldquo;edge router&rdquo;) between the 6LoWPAN
network and some other IPv6 network. This article actually ends up really being about routing
between IPv6 link local networks, joining them into a global IPv6 network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b9828"></a>
IPv6 Address Types</h2></div></div><p>
IPv6 has several different types of addresses, just like IPv4 does. Link local addresses
are visible only on a single link, and you can't route them. They are like link local
IPv4 addresses, and they're in the address range <tt  >fe80::/10</tt>.
There also are site local
addresses in the range <tt  >fec0::/10</tt>, but these are deprecated. Multicast addresses are in
the <tt  >ff00::/8</tt> range. The loopback address is
<tt  >::1/128</tt>. Every other address is a global
address.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b9a90"></a>
Getting a Fixed Link Local Address</h2></div></div><p>
Whenever you reboot the OpenLabs module, it gives itself a new MAC address. This is
used to generate the link local address, and later you will see this used as part of the
process to generate a global address. For the gateway, you will need a fixed global
address, or external clients won't know how to find it. So for the gateway, you should
fix the MAC address to ensure that you get a &ldquo;known&rdquo; global address.
</p><p>
General IPv6 addresses also are difficult to read and remember&mdash;16 hexadecimal
numbers. There are special simplification rules for addresses with zeros in them, so I
will exploit those here so you get simple addresses (for this article only, of course).
You
will set simple addresses on the gateway (needed) and on the sensor (convenient).
</p><p>
The MAC address <tt  >02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1</tt> generates the IPv6 host address
<tt  >::1</tt>, which is about as
simple as you can get. Set that on the gateway with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ip link set dev wpan0 address 02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b9da8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to give IPv6 host part <tt  >::1</tt>, and for convenience on the
sensor with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ip link set dev wpan0 address 02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b9f60"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to give IPv6 host part <tt  >::2</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20ba0c0"></a>
Getting a Routable IPv6 Address</h2></div></div><p>
When any host starts its networking, it is assigned an IPv6 link local
address automatically, based on its MAC address, which you have just set on the gateway and sensor
RPis. Routing tables also are set up on the local link, so hosts on the same link can
talk to each other directly.
</p><p>
It's easy to tell which addresses are link local addresses; they start with the prefix
<tt  >fe80:</tt>. The <tt  >ifconfig</tt> program on any
Linux/UNIX box will show something like this:
	
<pre     class="programlisting">
inet6 addr: fe80::84f1:df50:eb27:97ff/64 Scope:Link
</pre>
</p><p>
Because you've fixed the MAC address on the gateway, it's just:
	
<pre     class="programlisting">
inet6 addr: fe80::1/64 Scope:Link
</pre>
</p><p>
Link local packets aren't routable&mdash;that is, you can't send packets from one link to
another link. To route packets from one link to another, they must have a unique global
or unique local address.
</p><p>
Unique global addresses will be given to you by your internet provider, or
you can buy them
from an organization like ARIN. Australia's internet providers are way behind and
very few of them support IPv6. I don't want to buy one when I can't use it yet.
But, unique local addresses are good enough. I can route them across my private network
for free, across all my network segments. I probably won't ever want to broadcast my
temperature data across the whole internet anyway&mdash;at most I would process it on my
own network or send it to a particular cloud service.
</p><p>
The <a href="http://unique-local-ipv6.com" target="_self">unique-local-ipv6.com</a> website generates random unique local
/48 prefixes,
such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
fd28:e5e1:869::/48
</pre>
</p><p>
That leaves you 80 bits (128&ndash;48) for any subnets you want to create and unique
addresses within those subnets. So you can specify any 80 bits you want, or easier, any
20 hex digits. I'm going to cheat a bit and simplify this to prefix
<tt  >fd28::/64</tt> as a
64-bit prefix. Use this on the gateway explicitly by setting:
	
<pre     class="programlisting">
ip addr add fd28::1/64 dev lowpan0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20ba6f0"></a>
Packet Forwarding</h2></div></div><p>
The RPi you are going to use as the gateway must have two NICs. Well, this one does: the
6LoWPAN device and the Ethernet device. But just like any router in any UNIX system, it
has to be configured for packet forwarding between the NICs. This is really easy: edit
the /etc/sysctl.conf file and uncomment the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
</pre>
</p><p>
Then reboot, and it's an IPv6 router.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20ba8a8"></a>
Router Advertisements</h2></div></div><p>
You now have one fixed routable address that will be used for external clients to talk
to the gateway/router. You also have a fixed link local address for hosts on this local
link to talk to the gateway. At present, you have only one other RPi in the network, but
your 6LoWPAN network might consist of hundreds or even thousands of nodes, and they
need to be configured too, ending up with routable addresses so that external clients
can get and set information on the sensors/actuators. But, you don't want to be 
assigning addresses manually to every one of them!
</p><p>
The answer is <span   class="emphasis"><em>stateless address autoconfiguration</em></span> using
<span   class="emphasis"><em>router solicitation</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>router
advertisements</em></span>. You have to set up and configure router advertising, but then it becomes
a no-brainer. This is the IPv6 equivalent of DHCP.
</p><p>
A new IPv6 node attempting to join a network will send out a router solicitation
message using IPv6 multicast on its link local network. A router then will generate a
router advertisement, which it will send back using unicast, which will contain enough
information for the new node to configure itself.
</p><p>
The information supplied in the router adverts has basically two components:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The <span   class="emphasis"><em>link local</em></span> address of the router, so that the node can send it
messages.
</p></li><li><p>
A <span   class="emphasis"><em>prefix</em></span> to be used as the network component of a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>routable</em></span> address, to be used by the
node to generate a unique local routable address for the node.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
That's why you need a fixed link local address for the router to be used in router
adverts. This is in addition to the fixed routable address, so that external clients can
talk to the 6LoWPAN side of the gateway.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x24b3180"></a>
radvd: Router Advertisement D&aelig;mon for IPv6</h2></div></div><p>
The Linux d&aelig;mon to act as a router advertisement d&aelig;mon for UNIX-like systems is
<tt  >radvd</tt>. The version in the RPi repositories is unfortunately out
of date, so you need to
get a current version from GitHub and build it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone https://github.com/linux-wpan/radvd.git -b 6LoWPAN
cd radvd
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --sysconfdir=/etc 
 &#8618;--mandir=/usr/share/man
make
sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
You may need to install <tt  >bison</tt> from the repositories if it can't
find <tt  >flex</tt>.
</p><p>
Once built and installed, <tt  >radvd</tt> uses the configuration file
/etc/radvd.conf with the following contents:

<pre     class="programlisting">
interface lowpan0
{
    AdvSendAdvert on;
    # UnicastOnly on;
    AdvCurHopLimit 255;
    AdvSourceLLAddress on;

    prefix fd28::/64
    {
        # AdvOnLink off;
        AdvOnLink on;
        AdvAutonomous on;
        AdvRouterAddr on;
    };

    abro fe80::1
    {
        AdvVersionLow 10;
        AdvVersionHigh 2;
        AdvValidLifeTime 2;
    };
};
</pre>
</p><p>
This is adapted from Sebastian Meiling's page &ldquo;Setup native 6LoWPAN router using
Raspbian and RADVD&rdquo; (<a href="https://github.com/RIOT-Makers/wpan-raspbian/wiki/Setup-native-6LoWPAN-router-using-Raspbian-and-RADVD" target="_self">https://github.com/RIOT-Makers/wpan-raspbian/wiki/Setup-native-6LoWPAN-router-using-Raspbian-and-RADVD</a>).
The prefix is the random prefix I used earlier, <tt  >fd28::/64</tt>. The
<tt  >abro</tt>
(&ldquo;Authoritative Border Router Option&rdquo;) is the link local address of the router. You
will need to set your own addresses&mdash;at a minimum, the routable prefix.
</p><p>
I've made a couple changes to Sebastian's configuration: I've set
<tt  >AdvOnLink</tt> to <tt  >On</tt>;
whereas he has it as <tt  >Off</tt>. Setting the advert to
<tt  >On</tt> means:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The router itself won't get an address. That's okay; you want it to have a fixed
address not assigned by <tt  >radvd</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
For each node that has its IPv6 address set by <tt  >radvd</tt>, entries will be made in the
routing table to route <tt  >fd28::/64</tt> addresses through the 6LoWPAN device. Addresses with
this prefix are &ldquo;on this link&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
Most important, general addresses (<tt  >::/0</tt>) will route using the
<tt  >lowpan0</tt> NIC through the
link local gateway address <tt  >fe80::1</tt> to the external world.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I've also removed the <tt  >UnicastOnly on</tt> setting. The reasons are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Router adverts contain a timeout, defaulting to 30 minutes.
</p></li><li><p>
Unless updated, hosts will remove the routing entry on expiration of the timeout.
</p></li><li><p>
Hosts don't usually request new router adverts, only once on startup; they expect the
router to multicast new adverts every few minutes.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The <tt  >UnicastOnly on</tt> setting stops <tt  >radvd</tt>
from sending out these adverts, so you need to
remove it to allow the routing tables on hosts to be renewed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x24b4200"></a>
Router Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
All the work on the 6LoWPAN side is now done. On the Ethernet side, I also want to have
an IPv6 network, and as I am using unique local addresses, this network will be my
private network, probably with many link segments. To change it to be internet-global,
I would just need to change the unique local addresses to unique global addresses.
</p><p>
Initially I had problems routing IPv6 packets on my private network.
My home router (a Linksys EA6900) didn't seem to want to route
packets from my &ldquo;external&rdquo; host through to the gateway. I fixed that
by using a cross-over cable directly from my &ldquo;external&rdquo; host to the
gateway, and then after all, the home router decided to cooperate.
Then with radvd also delivering adverts on the Ethernet side to my
&ldquo;external&rdquo; host, I could ping from the 6LoWPAN network to the
Ethernet network and vice versa.
</p><p>
In summary, the steps to go through on the 6LoWPAN side are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Configure /etc/radvd.conf.
</p></li><li><p>
Bring up the 6LoWPAN device.
</p></li><li><p>
Set link local and routable addresses on the 6LoWPAN device.
</p></li><li><p>
Start up <tt  >radvd</tt>.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The <tt  >radvd</tt> configuration file is described above. The startup script for the rest should
be run as root and is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

# set the MAC address
ip link set dev wpan0 address 02:0:0:0:0:0:0:1

iwpan dev wpan0 set pan_id 0xbeef
ip link add link wpan0 name lowpan0 type lowpan
ifconfig wpan0 up
ifconfig lowpan0 up

# set the gateway address on the 6LoWPAN side
ip addr add fd28::1/64 dev lowpan0

# start the router advert daemon
radvd -m stderr
</pre>
</p><p>
On the Ethernet side, I also had configured /etc/radvd.conf to deliver adverts with
the <tt  >fd44::</tt> prefix, but I didn't get around to simplifying the Ethernet
MAC addresses.
</p><p>
The resulting IPv6 addresses on the gateway are:

<pre     class="programlisting">
eth0      Link encap: ...
          inet6 addr: fd44:::4adf:10a9:5c79:7954/64 Scope:Global
          inet6 addr: fe80::4adf:10a9:5c79:7954/64 Scope:Link

lowpan0   Link encap: ...
          inet6 addr: fd28::1/64 Scope:Global
          inet6 addr: fe80::1/64 Scope:Link
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x24b4a98"></a>
Sensor Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
The RPi acting as sensor doesn't have to do much; <tt  >radvd</tt> does most of it. The startup
script is just: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

ip link set dev wpan0 address 02:0:0:0:0:0:0:2
iwpan dev wpan0 set pan_id 0xbeef
ip link add link wpan0 name lowpan0 type lowpan
ifconfig wpan0 up
ifconfig lowpan0 up
</pre>
</p><p>
But, courtesy of <tt  >radvd</tt>, the device now has an IPv6-routable
address: <tt  >fd28::2</tt>, as shown
by <tt  >ifconfig</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
lowpan0   Link encap: ...
	  inet6 addr: fd28::2/64 Scope:Global
          inet6 addr: fe80::2/64 Scope:Link
</pre>
</p><p>
The routing table on the sensor RPi looks like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ route -A inet6
Kernel IPv6 routing table
Destination   Next Hop   Flag   Met Ref Use If
fd28::/64     ::         UAe    256 0     0 lowpan0
fe80::/64     ::         U      256 0     0 lowpan0
::/0          fe80::1    UGDAe 1024 0     0 lowpan0
ff00::/8      ::         U      256 1    18 lowpan0
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, addresses with the prefix <tt  >fd28::/64</tt> are on the
link through the <tt  >lowpan0</tt>
device. The address <tt  >::/0</tt> is the default route address, so all other packets are routed
through the <tt  >lowpan0</tt> NIC via the Next Hop address
<tt  >fe80::1</tt>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x24b50c8"></a>
Testing Routing</h2></div></div><p>
You can test this from each RPi by pinging the other RPi. That just tests local routing
though. To test this properly, you need to be able to talk through the Ethernet/Wi-Fi
NIC on the RPi router to another IPv6 device.
</p><p>
I've got the RPi router talking to an &ldquo;external&rdquo; host through a crossover cable for
simplicity, with <tt  >radvd</tt> delivering router adverts to it.
</p><p>
So then from the desktop, I can ping my RPi sensor:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ping6 fd28::2
PING fd28::2(fd28::2) 56 data bytes
64 bytes from fd28::2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=254 time=14.0 ms
64 bytes from fd28::2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=254 time=16.4 ms
64 bytes from fd28::2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=254 time=17.9 ms
</pre>
</p><p>
If you get successful pings, you know it works.
</p><p>
With that in place, the server code from my previous article (in the November 2016
issue) can be modified to use
routable addresses rather than link local addresses. This basically means you don't
have to specify the &ldquo;scope id&rdquo; (the NIC) anymore:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import socket
from subprocess import PIPE, Popen

HOST = ''       # Symbolic name meaning all available interfaces
PORT = 2016     # Arbitrary non-privileged port

def get_cpu_temperature():
    process = Popen(['vcgencmd', 'measure_temp'], stdout=PIPE)
    output, _error = process.communicate()
    return output

def main():
    s6 = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET6, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
    s6.bind((HOST, PORT, 0, 0))
    s6.listen(1)
    
    while True:
        conn, addr = s6.accept()
        conn.send(get_cpu_temperature())
        conn.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</pre>
</p><p>
The client gets modified similarly, omitting the scope id:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/python3

import socket
import time

ADDR = 'fd28::2'
PORT = 2016

def main():
    while True:
        s6 = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET6, socket.SOCK_STREAM, 0)
        s6.connect((ADDR, PORT, 0, 0))
        data = s6.recv(1024)
        print(data.decode('utf-8'), end='')

        # get it again after 10 seconds
        time.sleep(10)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
</pre>
</p><p>
The output from that on the client is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
temp=38.5'C
temp=38.5'C
temp=39.0'C
...
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x23c7228"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article has shown that 6LoWPAN devices can communicate to other IPv6 systems on
the routable internet. It has been mainly a journey about configuring IPv6 systems and
setting up the IPv6 equivalent of DHCP. However, the story for low power wireless isn't
over yet. The IoT at the application layer is standardizing on the CoAP and MQTT
protocols, and in my next article, I'll take a look at the CoAP application protocol.
