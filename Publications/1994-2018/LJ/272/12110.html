Progress on Privacy

There are now four ways we can protect our privacy online: encryption,
agreements, fiduciaries and laws. Three of those are new. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd6580.0x1ece300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The internet
didn't come with privacy, any more than the planet did. But at least
the planet had nature, which provided raw materials for the privacy
technologies we call clothing and shelter. On the net, we use human
nature to make our own raw materials. Those include code, protocols,
standards, frameworks and best practices, such as those behind free and
open-source software.
</p><p>
So far, our best privacy tech is encryption. But I won't dwell on that one,
because I assume all <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers are experts
at that. Instead,
I want to visit three others, all of which are new.
</p><p>
The first is agreements.
</p><p>
The most popular informal agreements in the physical world are called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>secrets</em></span>. These aren't especially enforceable,
but they are backed by <span   class="emphasis"><em>norms</em></span>, which are powerful
constraints operating in a social context. For example, we trust that
people, other than the intended recipient, won't open a sealed envelope,
even if they can. The seal (such as the one shown in Figure 1) signals
secrecy and has been in use for hundreds of years.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12110f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Seal Signaling Secrecy 
</p></div></div><p>
More formal are the legal agreements we call
<span   class="emphasis"><em>terms</em></span>. We encounter these every time we click
&ldquo;agree&rdquo; to something that looks like what is shown in Figure 2.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12110f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Legal Agreements We Call <span  class="emphasis"><em>Terms</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>
Did you read that? Go back and try reading it again.
</p><p>
These are &ldquo;contracts of adhesion&rdquo;, defined (by the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Legal
Dictionary</em></span>) as &ldquo;a standardized contract offered to
consumers on a 'take it or leave it' basis without giving the
consumer an opportunity to bargain for terms that are more
favorable&rdquo;
(<a href="http://legaldictionary.net/adhesion-contract" target="_self">legaldictionary.net/adhesion-contract</a>). After industry won
the industrial revolution, large companies needed to create legal
agreements for dealing with up to millions of customers. Contracts of
adhesion were the only way. Alas, this also sidelined freedom of contract
(<a href="http://www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/contract-law/the-doctrine-of-freedom-of-contract.php" target="_self">www.lawteacher.net/free-law-essays/contract-law/the-doctrine-of-freedom-of-contract.php</a>), 
&ldquo;which allows parties to provide for the terms and conditions that will
govern the relationship&rdquo; (says LawTeacher.net).
</p><p>
But now we have the internet, a natural heterarchy
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/opening-minds-spheres-among-us" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/opening-minds-spheres-among-us</a>) defined by protocols that start by assuming that every entity on it
is both free to participate and a peer. In this world we can bring
back freedom of contract by writing code that gives each of us ways to
make and assert our own terms, and to apply leverage as well&mdash;in other
words, to give <span   class="emphasis"><em>us</em></span> scale, as first parties. The
second parties are companies we deal with, and which can agree to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>our</em></span> terms. This isn't about turning the tables on
companies, but rather setting a table that's flat, with both parties
operating in a trusting way with each other.
</p><p>
To get this rolling, we now have Customer Commons
(<a href="http://customercommons.org" target="_self">customercommons.org</a>), which will do for personal terms
what Creative Commons (<a href="https://creativecommons.org" target="_self">https://creativecommons.org</a>) does for
copyright. Right now Customer Commons is co-baking standard
terms with the Consent &amp; Information Sharing Working Group at Kantara
(<a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/infosharing/User+Submitted+Terms+project+overview" target="_self">https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/infosharing/User+Submitted+Terms+project+overview</a>).
For example, see Figure 3
(<a href="http://customercommons.org/2016/01/04/terms-what-are-they-and-why-should-you-care" target="_self">customercommons.org/2016/01/04/terms-what-are-they-and-why-should-you-care</a>).

Figure 3. Customer Commons User Terms
</p></div></div><p>
In this example, the individual (as the first party) says personal
data in a session is to be shared only with the second party (the
website) for site use only, and to obey the Do Not Track request
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track</a>) expressed by the HTTP header
in the individual's browser.
</p><p>
Another one is #NoStalking
(<a href="http://customercommons.org/2016/07/15/latest-draft-of-the-no-stalking-for-advertising-term-v-2" target="_self">customercommons.org/2016/07/15/latest-draft-of-the-no-stalking-for-advertising-term-v-2</a>),
shown in Figure 4, copied off a whiteboard last May at VRM Day
(<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72157668230728355" target="_self">https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/sets/72157668230728355</a>).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12110f4.large.jpg"><img src="12110f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. #NoStalking
</p></div></div><p>
While Do Not Track, tracking protection and ad blocking have
prophylactic effects on privacy threats to individuals, #NoStalking
works as a peace offering to publishers in the midst of the
&ldquo;war&rdquo;
over ad blocking (<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war" target="_self">blogs.harvard.edu/doc/the-adblock-war</a>). As
I explain in &ldquo;Why #NoStalking is a good deal for publishers&rdquo;
(<a href="http://blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2016/05/11/why-a-nostalking-deal-is-good-for-publishers" target="_self">blogs.harvard.edu/vrm/2016/05/11/why-a-nostalking-deal-is-good-for-publishers</a>),
&ldquo;it's a good one for both sides. Individuals proffering the #NoStalking
term get guilt-free use of the goods they come to the publisher for,
and the publisher gets to stay in business&mdash;and improve that business
by running advertising that is actually valued by its recipients.&rdquo;
</p><p>
By valued I mean <span   class="emphasis"><em>not based</em></span> on tracking. As Don Marti
(<a href="http://zgp.org/~dmarti" target="_self">zgp.org/~dmarti</a>) explains in &ldquo;Targeted Advertising Considered
Harmful&rdquo; (<a href="http://zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful" target="_self">zgp.org/targeted-advertising-considered-harmful</a>), &ldquo;The
more targetable that an ad medium is, the less it's worth.&rdquo; That's
because non-targeted (that is, non-tracking-based) ads support the value of
the publication they sponsor while also being supported by it. As Don
puts it, non-targeted ads carry an economic <span   class="emphasis"><em>signal</em></span>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_%28economics%29" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_%28economics%29</a>),
which &ldquo;is
proportional to the value of the content, not just the ad itself&rdquo;. So,
when your browser tells a publisher you want #NoStalking from them, and
the publisher agrees, you know that the ads you'll see are ones that
value the content you came to the site for, rather than ones based on
robotic surveillance of your life online, and likely to have little or
nothing to do with the value of publication itself (serving, as it does,
only as a sluice of convenience for advertising messages). It also says
both the publication and the advertiser value your privacy.
</p><p>
The third privacy protection comes through
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fiduciaries</em></span>. This is both an old and a
new idea. In their book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Net Worth: Shaping Markets When
Customers Make the Rules</em></span> (Harvard Business Review Press, 1999,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Net-Worth-Shaping-Markets-Customers/dp/0875848893" target="_self">https://www.amazon.com/Net-Worth-Shaping-Markets-Customers/dp/0875848893</a>),
John Hagel and Marc Singer coined the term infomediary,
for &ldquo;a trusted third party&rdquo; or &ldquo;a kind of agent&rdquo; that
will &ldquo;become the custodians and brokers of customer
information&rdquo;. In &ldquo;A Grand Bargain to Make Tech Companies
Trustworthy&rdquo; (<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Atlantic</em></span>, October 3, 2016,
<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346" target="_self">www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346</a>),
law professors Jack Balkin of Yale
(<a href="https://www.law.yale.edu/jack-m-balkin" target="_self">https://www.law.yale.edu/jack-m-balkin</a>) and Jonathan Zittrain of
Harvard (<a href="http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10992/Zittrain" target="_self">hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10992/Zittrain</a>)
advance the concept of an <span   class="emphasis"><em>information fiduciary</em></span>:
&ldquo;a person or business that deals not in money but in
information&rdquo;. Like
doctors, lawyers and accountants, fiduciaries &ldquo;have to keep our secrets
and they can't use the information they collect about us against our
interests&rdquo;. This gives companies like Facebook and Google a job they
didn't know they took on when they began to gather mountains of personal
information about us. &ldquo;The important question is whether these businesses,
like older fiduciaries, have legal obligations to be trustworthy. The
answer is that they should.&rdquo;
</p><p>
This is a legal and rhetorical hack of the first water. Brilliant.
</p><p>
It also nicely frames up advances in regulation, which is the fourth
form of privacy protection. In Australia and the European Union,
personal data protection is already baked into in laws imposing strong
privacy protection obligations on those collecting personal data about
us. Of special interest is the General Data Protection Regulation
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation</a>),
aka the GDPR, in the EU. Search on Google for
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=General+Data+Protection+Regulation" target="_self">https://www.google.com/search?q=General+Data+Protection+Regulation</a>,
and you'll have to look down past a pile of advertising
toward &ldquo;compliance&rdquo; offices at big companies before
you get to the link I just used (to the GDPR's Wikipedia
article). That's because the sanctions imposed on violators
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation#Sanctions" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation#Sanctions</a>)
include &ldquo;a fine up to 20,000,000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking,
up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial
year, whichever is higher&rdquo; (Article 83, Paragraph 5 &amp; 6). That doesn't
hit until 2018, but it's a big ouch in the meantime. But, with the
looming threat of GDPR enforcement, new terms coming from the individual
(another great hack) can offer genuine relief, even if lawmakers didn't
see them coming. (Note that I avoid the term &ldquo;user&rdquo;. That's because
&ldquo;user&rdquo; positions the individual as the subordinate party,
always &ldquo;using&rdquo;
something provided by others. When the individual is the first party,
sites and services such as those addressed by the GDPR are the actual
users of personal data, and of terms to which they agree before using
that data.)
</p><p>
On page 121 of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Free Culture</em></span> (Penguin Press, 2004,
<a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/freeculture.pdf" target="_self">www.free-culture.cc/freeculture.pdf</a>), Lawrence Lessig introduced
a diagram that has since attained the status of canon (Figure 5). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12110f5.large.jpg"><img src="12110f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Lawrence Lessig's Diagram of the Individual as the Target of
Regulation 
</p></div></div><p>
Below it he explains, &ldquo;At the center of this picture is a regulated dot:
the individual or group that is the target of regulation, or the holder
of a right....The ovals represent four ways in which the individual or
group might be regulated&mdash;either constrained or, alternatively,
enabled.&rdquo;
</p><p>
We're talking about enablement here, and the assertion of rights. So
think of those arrows pointing outward from the individual, influencing
all four of those domains.
</p><p>
So how do these four approaches to privacy protection match up with those
domains? <span   class="emphasis"><em>Encryption</em></span> is pure architecture. Balkin
and Zittrain's <span   class="emphasis"><em>fiduciary</em></span> hack is on norms and
law. <span   class="emphasis"><em>New privacy rules</em></span> such as the GDPR are already
law. And <span   class="emphasis"><em>terms proffered by individuals</em></span>, in a
freedom-of-contract way, are laws of their own, supported by architecture
in the form of code, and influencing both norms and the market as well.
</p><p>
The result will be privacy that's as casual and uncontroversial online
as it is in the offline world. But first we have to finish scaling up
terms and the code and protocols required to make them work. Those four
domains aren't going to fix themselves.
