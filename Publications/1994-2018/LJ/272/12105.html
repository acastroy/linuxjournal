<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #272, December 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
With the demise of the <span   class="bold"><b>big kernel lock</b></span> (BKL), various new locks have
taken its place to cover various types of situations, some more
rarefied than others. Recently <span   class="bold"><b>Waiman Long</b></span>
implemented the <span   class="bold"><b>TO futex</b></span>
(throughput-optimized futex), which prioritizes throughput over giving
all processes a fair chance to claim the lock.
</p><p>
It's a strange concept&mdash;usually a UNIX-based system would make
fairness to all users the highest priority. But the TO futex
outperformed <span   class="bold"><b>wait-wake futexes</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>priority-inheritance futexes</b></span> on
certain workloads, specifically those involving short, critical
sections of code, with large numbers of threads competing for the same
lock.
</p><p>
Sometimes, as <span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Gleixner</b></span> pointed out, it can be hard for
developers to know which futex to choose, given so many options and
each with such specific optimal use patterns, although Waiman has said
he feels the TO futex may simply outperform the others well enough to
be the preferred choice almost all the time.
</p><p>
It's hard to know for sure. We can assume that the many-eyes principle
of open-source development implies that eventually any poor locking
choice will be found and fixed. So maybe the added complexity will
simply come out in the wash. On the other hand, there's a real benefit
in developers actually being able to understand what they're doing
when they modify kernel code. So, keeping Linux locking simple may turn
out to be preferable in the end.
</p><p>
Sometimes kernel developers will turn their attention to corner cases
and pathological conditions, trying to smooth out behaviors that
rarely if ever occur.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Al Viro</b></span> gave that a shot recently, when he
noticed that the <span   class="bold"><b>writev()</b></span>
system call seemed to behave unintuitively when fed certain kinds of
bad input. The writev() call writes a series of memory buffers to a
file. But if one of the middle buffers is given an undefined address
in the input, writev() still would write the first portion of data
before giving up.
</p><p>
He felt this was a mistake. Instead of writing just a portion of the
data&mdash;essentially creating an unpredictable state via behaviors that
developers should definitely not rely on&mdash;he felt that no data (or
at least a predictable amount of data) should be written, and the
call should return the <span   class="bold"><b>EFAULT</b></span> error code.
</p><p>
When it comes to system calls, however, you can't just do whatever you
want. There are various standards, specifically <span   class="bold"><b>POSIX</b></span>, that you either
have to obey or have a good reason not to.
</p><p>
In this case, Al felt that POSIX was vague enough to let his preferred
behavior sail through. As he understood the standard, the exact amount
of data written when the error occurred was actually variable. And,
that being the case, he figured why not just make the logic be &ldquo;if
some addresses in the buffer(s) we are asked to write are invalid, the
write will be shortened by up to a PAGE_SIZE from the first such
invalid address&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> approved this arrangement,
but <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> objected. He
noted that POSIX version 1003.1 said &ldquo;Each iovec entry specifies the
base address and length of an area in memory from which data should be
written. The writev() function shall always write a complete area
before proceeding to the next.&rdquo;
</p><p>
So, instead of shortening the write by up to PAGE_SIZE, Alan's reading
of the standard required writing the whole amount of data and then
failing on the upcoming invalid address.
</p><p>
But, Alan pointed out that passing an invalid address to writev() was
not anything anyone would want to do and didn't have any clearly
defined consequence. He felt it would be more useful to think about
how to deal with realistic causes of writev() being passed an invalid
address&mdash;for example, when the system ran out of disk space in the
midst of the writev() call.
</p><p>
Linus felt that the disk-full scenario was a reasonable situation to
care about. But, he also felt that the main point of the POSIX
behavior&mdash;either expressed or implied&mdash;was to prevent weird situations where
users could see later writes without being able to see earlier ones.
He felt it was important to ensure that &ldquo;you cannot do some fancy
threaded thing where you do different iovec parts concurrently,
because that could be seen by a reader (or more likely mmap) as doing
the writes out of order.&rdquo;
</p><p>
It's unclear which behavior might ultimately get into the kernel.
These debates often pull from bizarre sources. For example, it could
turn out that there's some kind of security issue with one or the
other position on the issue, in which case whichever position
successfully addressed the security concern would be the winner.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Luis R. Rodriguez</b></span> tried to fix a possible race condition by having
userspace recognize a given situation and alert the kernel. Not
surprisingly, it was met with a strong rebuke from Linus Torvalds.
</p><p>
The race condition occurred if the user tried to read a file from the
system's filesystem during bootup. If the read occurred at one time,
the filesystem would be unavailable, but if the read occurred
slightly later, it would.
</p><p>
The problem, as he saw it, was that only userspace could know whether
certain filesystems already had been mounted. The obvious solution, he
felt, was for userspace to alert the kernel to the filesystem
availability, so the kernel could attempt to access the needed file
only after that file was actually on a mounted filesystem.
</p><p>
Linus called this a &ldquo;horrible hack&rdquo; and a white flag of surrender. Not
only that, but he said &ldquo;it's broken nasty crap with a user interface,
so we'll be stuck with it forever.&rdquo;
</p><p>
He suggested instead that any drivers running into this problem simply
be fixed to not do that. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Dmitry
Torokhov</b></span> didn't see how that could
be accomplished. He said:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Some devices do need to have firmware
loaded so we know their capabilities, so we really can't push the
firmware loading into &ldquo;open&rdquo;....These devices we want to probe
asynchronously and simply tell the firmware loader to wait for firmware to
become available. The problem is we do not know when to give up, since we
do not know where the firmware might be. But userspace knows and can
tell us.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And, <span   class="bold"><b>Bjorn Andersson</b></span> piled on, saying
there were actual real-world
cases that would benefit from Luis' code.
</p><p>
But, Linus saw the entire concept as too broken to salvage, regardless
of any use value it might have. He would rather bundle firmware
directly into a kernel module, he said, than have the kernel depend on
a userspace notification.
</p><p>
The whole discussion was useful mostly as an example of how kernel
developers can stand up under scathing critiques from Linus and still
pull useful technical feedback out of what he says. In this case, he
left no room for doubt&mdash;alerts coming from userspace to the kernel
would not be allowed under any circumstances.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Landing on the Moon, with your Thumbs</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #272, December 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I do a lot of system administration with my thumbs. Yes, if I'm
home, I grab a laptop or go to my office and type in a real terminal
window. Usually, when things go wrong though, I'm at my daughters' volleyball
match or shopping with my wife. Thankfully, most tasks can be done
remotely via SSH. There are lots of SSH clients for Android, but my
favorite is JuiceSSH.
</p><p>
Yes, part of my love for the app is that it has a cool icon in the shape
of a lemon, but really, there's more to it than that. It has a plugin
architecture that allows you to build functionality on top of SSH. It
also allows you to execute code snippets on multiple connections with
a click of a button.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12105androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12105androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
They keyboard is designed in such a way that even vi users like myself
can manage to edit files remotely. And thanks to the ability to import
private SSH keys, I can connect to those servers where I have password
authentication disabled. (For example, most cloud servers don't allow
you to log in via password, they require you to use SSH keys, which
is awesome.)
</p><p>
To be honest, I do so much work remotely with my phone, that I'm
considering getting a foldable Bluetooth keyboard so I can actually
do some typing in a pinch if needed. If I find a keyboard I like,
I'll be sure to write about it in a future issue! You can get JuiceSSH
from the Google Play Store.

<h2 class="title">Pythonic Science in the Browser</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #272, December 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In the past, if you wanted a friendly environment for doing Python
programming, you would use Ipython. The Ipython project actually consists
of three parts: the standard console interface, a Qt-based GUI interface
and a web server interface that you can connect to with a web browser. The
web browser interface, especially, has become the de facto way of doing
scientific programming with Python. It has become so popular in fact, it has
spun off as its own project, named Jupyter. In this article, I take a
look at how to get the latest version up and running, and I discuss the kinds of
things you can do with it once it is set up.
</p><p>
The first step is to install the latest version. Because it is under
very active development, you probably will want to keep it updated on
your system. <tt  >pip</tt> is definitely the easiest way to do this. The following
command will install Jupyter, if it isn't already installed,
or it will update Jupyter to the latest version:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo pip install --upgrade jupyter
</pre>
</p><p>
Be sure that you have a C compiler installed, along with
the development package for Python. For example, on Debian-based systems,
you can be sure you are ready by executing the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install python-dev build-essentials
</pre>
</p><p>
This should make sure you have everything you need installed. 
</p><p>
To start Jupyter,
open a terminal window and enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
jupyter notebook --no-browser
</pre>
</p><p>
This will start a web server, listening on port 8888, that will accept
connections from the local machine. For security reasons, by default,
it will ignore incoming connections from outside machines. If you want
to set it up to accept connections from outside machines, you can do so
by adding an extra option:

<pre     class="programlisting">
jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=*
</pre>
</p><p>
This makes your Jupyter server wide open, so it is strongly discouraged
unless you are on a secure private network. Otherwise, you should have
some sort of user authentication set up to manage who can use your system.
</p><p>
Once Jupyter is up and running, open a browser and point it to
http://localhost:8888. Across the top, you will see a
series of tabs for each section of the workspace. Most people will 
see only three: Files, Running and Clusters. If you are using the Anaconda
Python distribution, you will get a fourth tab named Conda. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12105jupyterf1.large.jpg"><img src="12105jupyterf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you first enter Jupyter, you are presented with a file listing from the
current working directory.
</p></div></div><p>
On startup,
you will be located at the first tab, Files. This is simply a directory
listing of the current working directory. You probably won't have any
notebooks currently available, so you will need to create a new one. You
can do that by clicking the drop-down list on the right-hand side of the screen
labeled New and selecting the Python notebook entry on the menu. This
will open a new browser tab and load a new empty notebook.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12105jupyterf2.large.jpg"><img src="12105jupyterf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Clicking on the New tab will load a new, empty notebook within a new
browser tab.
</p></div></div><p>
The
second tab shows you all of the active notebooks running on this
particular server. You can click the related link to open
the selected notebook in a new browser tab or click the Shutdown button
to halt the selected notebook. There is also a section for any active
terminal sessions. The Clusters section gives you status information
on the parallel Python engines that are configured on your system. By
default, this isn't configured at all. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12105jupyterf3.large.jpg"><img src="12105jupyterf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can get a listing of all of the active notebooks and terminal sessions.
</p></div></div><p>
If you are using Anaconda, you
will get a fourth section labeled Conda. This section
gives you details about what packages are available and what packages are
installed. You even can manage your Conda environments, creating new ones,
exporting existing ones or deleting environments that you are done with.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12105jupyterf4.large.jpg"><img src="12105jupyterf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Jupyter lets you check the details of your Anaconda packages and
environments.
</p></div></div><p>
Let's take a look at what you can do with the notebook itself. The
interface should feel familiar to people who have used applications
like Maple or Mathematica. Your input is entered in sections called
cells. Cells can be of different types, namely code, markdown text
or headings. This way, you can have text cells describing the code
sections, explaining what the code is doing and why. It's extremely useful
when you're doing scientific calculations, because it allows you to include your
documentation with your code, so everything stays synchronized and
up to date. 
</p><p>
When you start entering lines of code, pressing Enter takes
you to a new line within the same cell. None of the code gets executed
yet. When you are ready to run the cell, press the Shift and
Enter keys together. All of the code runs within the same
Python engine, so results from one cell will be available to other cells
later on. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12105jupyterf5.large.jpg"><img src="12105jupyterf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. You get the output from your Python code displayed within the notebook.
</p></div></div><p>
You also can import extra Python modules, just like you do in
any other Python environment. The most useful for visualizing data and
results is matplotlib. If you import the matplotlib module and execute
plotting commands, Jupyter can render the resulting graphs directly
in the notebook. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12105jupyterf6.large.jpg"><img src="12105jupyterf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Jupyter can render matplotlib graphs directly in the notebook.
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, you need to use an
extra statement that starts with a % character to tell Jupyter to
render the plot as an image within the notebook. Otherwise, the plots
will be rendered within a new window. This new statement is called a
magic. There is an entire library of magics available. For example,
you can use the timeit magic to profile how long it takes to run the
code within a cell. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12105jupyterf7.large.jpg"><img src="12105jupyterf7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. There are several magic statements available, such as the timeit magic to
find runtimes of code cells.
</p></div></div><p>
If it is a section of code that has
a short runtime, Jupyter automatically will run it several times to get
an average runtime. This allows you to work on optimizing your code
as well as developing it.
</p><p>
When you are ready to share your results, several different
options are available. You always can simply share the Jupyter notebook. It
is all stored in a single file with the filename ending .ipynb. The
other options depend a bit on which Python modules you have
installed on your system. The formats most often used are either as a
single static HTML page or PDF document. If you are going to present
your results, you even can export it as an HTML-based presentation where
the cells are formatted as individual slides. All of these options are
available under the File&rarr;Download As menu item.
</p><p>
Hopefully this article has shown some functionality you can make use of in your
own code. Jupyter is especially useful for scientific exploration. You
can try lots of different calculations and do different types of data
analysis and see the results right away within the notebook. And when
you reach a useful conclusion, you can share the notebook with others
within the growing community of Jupyter users.

<h2 class="title">Automatic Slack Notifications</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #272, December 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Slack is an incredible communication tool
for groups of any size (see my piece on it in the November 2016 issue). At the company I work for during the day,
Slack has become more widely used than email or instant messaging. It
truly has become the hub of company communication. So rather than have
my servers send email, I've turned to Slack for delivering information
to my users. Thankfully, Slack is extremely open to adding applications
and integrations.
</p><p>
The simplest integration is called an &ldquo;incoming webhook&rdquo;, and it delivers
messages to Slack channels (or individual users) by sending a POST to a
specially formed URL. The first step is to find the custom integration
area in Slack, which isn't as clear as I'd like. On the website, click
on your Slack group name at the top left, and pick &ldquo;Apps &amp;
Integrations&rdquo;
from the drop-down menu. Then on the apps page, click &ldquo;build&rdquo; on the
upper right. Finally, click &ldquo;Make a Custom Integration&rdquo; and select
&ldquo;incoming webhooks&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12105slackf1.large.jpg"><img src="12105slackf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
From there it's a matter of selecting where you want the notification to
post, what icon to give it, what name to assign to your bot and so on. Once
it's saved, you can use <tt  >curl</tt> to post a message to your unique URL (which
is on the creation page, be sure to copy it to your clipboard):

<pre     class="programlisting">
curl -X POST --data "payload={"text": "Cool Message"}" 
 &#8618;https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOURAPI/CODEHERE/TOPOST
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it! You can create a BASH script to make the process simple
and integrate the notification system into your server scripts!

<h2 class="title">My Cup of Tea</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #272, December 2016</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Computer folks are known for their mass consumption of caffeinated
beverages. Some prefer coffee; some prefer tea. (Some drink energy
drinks too, but we won't talk about those folks.) I actually go between
coffee and tea depending on the season. During the summer, I drink mainly
coffee. It can be freshly ground brewed coffee, a fancy coffee made with
my espresso machine or even a quick K-cup abomination at 6am. But once
fall sets in and the snow starts falling, I always switch to tea. I'm
not sure why, but for me, the winter means tea.
</p><p>
Why would I mention my preferences in a tech magazine? Because if you're
like me and drink tea, either seasonally or exclusively, you know it can
be a pain. Sure there are teabags for people who don't care what their tea
tastes like, but I prefer loose-leaf tea. And, it can be a pain to make. A
couple years back I discovered the Adagio ingenuiTEA steeping device. 
It makes loose-leaf tea actually easier than teabags. You simply put the
loose tea in the top, poor hot water directly on the leaves, and then
after steeping, you let it drain through the filter into your cup.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12105teaf1.large.jpg"><img src="12105teaf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Through the years, I've purchased several brands of the tea steepers
(my current favorite is the Teaze Tea Infuser), and they all work in a
similar manner. It's amazing how often I use my Teaze device, even when
I have a $250 Breville Perfect Tea maker on my office shelf. I still go
to the $15 device 95% of the time! It may seem like an odd recommendation
for a tech magazine, but anyone in the tech industry knows that a proper
beverage is as important as a proper operating system, so check one out
today. If you search for &ldquo;ingenuitea&rdquo; on Amazon, you'll see a bunch of
different brands. They're cheap, and awesome. In fact, it might be the
first time I've ever given a non-tech-related item the Editors' Choice
award,
but if you like tea, I urge you to give it a try.

I listen to a lot of audiobooks. They're not the sort of thing you blast
from your car speakers, because invariably when you pull up to a drive-thru window, it's at an awkward part of the book. Thankfully I don't
read many books with sex scenes, but it's a bit embarrassing when it's a
super-cheesy-sounding part of the book that plays while you're paying. But,
I digress.
</p><p>
I don't like earbuds or headphones, because I prefer to hear what's going
on around me. So when I'm driving, or walking with someone, I tend to
leave one earbud in, and the other out. It's not perfect, but it works.
</p><p>
Recently, however, I discovered bone-conduction headphones. I really like
the Trekz Titanium model (<a href="https://aftershokz.com/products/trekz-titanium" target="_self">https://aftershokz.com/products/trekz-titanium</a>), but they're fairly pricey, and others might work just as well. 
</p><p>
The concept
is that instead of putting something in your ears, the device vibrates the
bones in your head, which in turn vibrate your inner ears and produce
sound. It means your ears are completely open, so you can hear people
talking to you or honking behind you. Thanks to the sound transferring
internally, however, you still can hear the audio really well too. In
fact, if you want to drown out the outside world, you can put earplugs
in and totally immerse yourself in audio. It feels weird to increase
the volume by plugging your ears, but it works. In fact, if you want to
try it, just hum, and while you're humming, plug your ears. That same
sort of thing happens with bone conduction headsets. It's sort of magical.

Like I said, I use Trekz brand and really like them. I can take calls,
listen to music or play/pause my audiobooks with ease. If you like
the privacy of earbuds, but don't want to stick anything in your ears,
give bone conduction a try. I thought it was a gimmick, but I'm happy
to say I was wrong!
