OAuth uses digital signatures rather than the &ldquo;Basic&rdquo;
authentication method used by the HTTP protocol.

During the past several decades, Web pages have changed from being static,
mostly informational tools to full-blown applications. Coinciding
with this development, Web developers have created interfaces to their
Web applications so that other developers could develop applications
to work with the Web application. For instance, think of any
application on your phone for a Web service. This is possible
only because of the application programming interface (API) constructed
by the Web service's developers.
</p><p>
An API allows developers to give others access to certain
functionality of their service without losing control of their service
or how it behaves. With the development of these APIs arose the issue
of user authentication and security. Every time you want to do
something with the service, you have to send your user credentials
(typically a user ID and password). This exposes the user to
interested parties and makes the authentication untrustworthy. The
application used by the user also could store the password and allow
another application or person access to the user's account.
</p><p>
Enter OAuth.
</p><p>
OAuth is intended to be a simple, secure way to authenticate users
without exposing their secret credentials to anyone who shouldn't have
access to them. It was started in November 2006 by Blaine Cook, who
was working on an OpenID implementation for Twitter. While working on
it, Blaine realized that the Twitter API couldn't deal with a user who
had authenticated with an OpenID. He got in touch with Chris Messina
in order to find a way to use OpenID with the Twitter API. After several
conversations with a few other people later, OAuth was born. In
December of that year, OAuth Core 1.0 was finalized.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1634580.0x172c5c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
Since August 31, 2010, all third-party Twitter applications
are required to use OAuth.
</p></div><p>
You can think of OAuth like an ATM card. Your bank account (the Web
service) has a load of services associated with it, and you can use
all of them, provided you put your card in the ATM and enter your PIN.
Ultimately, anyone who has your card and PIN has full access to your
account and can use all those neat services to do whatever he or she wants
to your account. However, you can use your card as a credit card as
well, and in that case, replace your knowledge of the PIN with a
signature. In this capacity, the cardholder can do only very limited
transactions, namely make charges against the balance of the account.
</p><p>
If someone were to try to use your signature to charge something to
your account without your card, it wouldn't work. If you had the card
but not the signature, the same result would occur (theoretically).
OAuth works in a similar manner. If an application has your
signature, it can make API calls on your behalf to the Web service,
but that signature works only with that application. Allowing one
party to access someone else's resources on his or her behalf is the core
of the OAuth protocol.

An Example of OAuth</h2></div></div><p>
Consider user Jane, a member of a photo-sharing site,
photosharingexample.com (Service Provider), where she keeps all her
pictures. For Christmas, she decides to give her mother some nice
prints of her family, so she signs up for an account with another site
called photoprintingexample.com (Consumer). The new site,
photoprintingexample.com,
has a feature that allows Jane to select pictures stored in her
photosharingexample.com account and transfer them to her
photoprintingexample.com account to be printed.
</p><p>
Photoprintingexample.com already has registered for a Consumer Key and
Consumer Secret from photosharingexample.com:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Consumer Key:  dpf43f3p2l4k3l03
Consumer Secret:  kd94hf93k423kf44
</pre>
</p><p>
Jane elects to use this service. When photoprintingexample.com tries
to retrieve Jane's pictures from photosharingexample.com, it
receives an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error, indicating those photos
are private. This is expected, because Jane hasn't authorized
photoprintingexample.com access to her photosharingexample.com account
yet. The Consumer sends the following request to the Service
Provider:


<pre     class="programlisting">
https://photosharingexample.com/request_token?
&#8618;oauth_consumer_key=dpf43f3p2l4k3l03&amp;oauth_
&#8618;signature_method=PLAINTEXT&amp;oauth_signature=
&#8618;kd94hf93k423kf44%26&amp;oauth_timestamp=
&#8618;1191242090&amp;oauth_nonce=hsu94j3884jdopsl&amp;oauth_version=1.0
</pre>
</p><p>
Using nonces can be very costly for Service Providers, as they demand
persistent storage of all nonce values ever received. To make server
implementations less costly, OAuth adds a timestamp value to each
request, which allows the Service Provider to keep nonce values
only for a limited time. When a request comes in with a timestamp that is
older than the retained time frame, it is rejected, because the Service
Provider no longer has nonces from that time period.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1634580.0x172cb98"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Nonce</b></p><p>
The term nonce means &ldquo;number used once&rdquo; and is a unique and
usually random string that is meant to identify each signed
request uniquely.
</p></div><p>
The Service Provider checks the signature of the request and replies
with an unauthorized request token:


<pre     class="programlisting">
oauth_token=hh5s93j4hdidpola&amp;oauth_token_secret=hdhd0244k9j7ao03
</pre>
</p><p>
The Consumer redirects Jane's browser to the Service Provider User
Authorization URL:


<pre     class="programlisting">
http://photosharingexample.com/authorize?oauth_token=
&#8618;hh5s93j4hdidpola&amp;oauth_callback=
&#8618;http%3A%2F%2Fphotoprintingexample.com%2Frequest_token_ready
</pre>
</p><p>
If Jane is logged in to photosharingexample.com, this page will ask her
whether she authorizes photoprintingexample.com to have access to her
account. If Jane authorizes the request, her browser will be
redirected back to
http://photoprintingexample.com/request_token_ready?oauth_token=hh5s93j4hdidpola,
telling the consumer that the request token has been authorized. The
Consumer then will exchange the Request Token for an Access Token
using the following address:


<pre     class="programlisting">
https://photosharingexample.com/access_token?
&#8618;oauth_consumer_key=dpf43f3p2l4k3l03&amp;oauth_token=
&#8618;hh5s93j4hdidpola&amp;oauth_signature_method=PLAINTEXT&amp;
&#8618;oauth_signature=kd94hf93k423kf44%26hdhd0244k9j7ao03&amp;
&#8618;oauth_timestamp=1191242092&amp;oauth_nonce=
&#8618;dji430splmx33448&amp;oauth_version=1.0
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1634580.0x172d118"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which will return the Access Token in the response:


<pre     class="programlisting">

oauth_token=nnch734d00sl2jdk&amp;oauth_token_secret=pfkkdhi9sl3r4s00

</pre>
</p><p>
This exchange will happen only the first time Jane tries to access her
photosharingexample.com photos from photoprintingexample.com. Any
time afterward, only the following will happen.
</p><p>
Now, the Consumer is equipped properly to access Jane's photos. First,
the Consumer needs to generate the request signature. The
initial step is to create the Signature Base String. This is a
combination of the following elements:

<pre     class="programlisting">
oauth_consumer_key: dpf43f3p2l4k3l03
oauth_token: nnch734d00sl2jdk
oauth_signature_method: HMAC-SHA1
oauth_timestamp: 1191242096
oauth_nonce: kllo9940pd9333jh
oauth_version: 1.0
file: family.jpg
size: original
</pre>
</p><p>
Ultimately, you end up with the string:


<pre     class="programlisting">
GET&amp;http%3A%2F%2Fphotosharingexample.com%2Fphotos&amp;
&#8618;file%3Dfamily.jpg%26oauth_consumer_key%
&#8618;3Ddpf43f3p2l4k3l03%26oauth_nonce%3Dkllo9940pd9333jh%
&#8618;26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA1%26oauth_timestamp%
&#8618;3D1191242096%26oauth_token%3Dnnch734d00sl2jdk%
&#8618;26oauth_version%3D1.0%26size%3Doriginal"
</pre>
</p><p>
If your request is being transmitted through SSL, the request can be
in plain text. However, a vast majority of Web sites do not use SSL,
so the signature string must be encoded.
</p><p>
Traditionally, the HTTP protocol uses an authentication method it
calls &ldquo;Basic&rdquo; in which users provide their user names and
passwords
in order to gain access to the protected resource. The major flaw in
that procedure is that those credentials are passed in plain text,
clear for any people listening to read and store as they wish. In order
to protect users' credentials, OAuth uses digital signatures
instead of sending credentials with each request.
</p><p>
This digital signature is used to verify that the request being made
is legitimate and hasn't been tampered with. A hashing algorithm is
used to make that work. In order to allow the recipient to verify
that the request came from the claimed sender, the hash algorithm is
combined with a shared secret. If both sides agree on a secret known
only to both parties, they can add it to the content being hashed.
This can be done by simply appending the secret to the content, or
by using a more sophisticated algorithm with a built-in mechanism for
secrets, such as HMAC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1634580.0x172d698"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
OAuth defines three signature methods used to sign and verify
requests: PLAINTEXT, HMAC-SHA1 and RSA-SHA1.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1634580.0x172d8a8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Hash Algorithm</b></p><p>
The process of taking data (of any size) and
condensing it to a much smaller value (digest) in a fully reproducible
(one-way) manner.
Using the same hash algorithm on the same data always
will produce the same smaller value.
</p></div><p>
For this example, let's say the Service Provider allows HMAC-SHA1
signatures. Thus, the encoded signature string becomes:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tR3+Ty81lMeYAr/Fid0kMTYa/WM=
</pre>
</p><p>
All together, the Consumer request for the photo is:


<pre     class="programlisting">
http://photosharingexample.com/photos?file=vacation.jpg&amp;size=
&#8618;original&amp;oauth_consumer_key=dpf43f3p2l4k3l03&amp;
&#8618;oauth_token=nnch734d00sl2jdk&amp;oauth_signature_method=
&#8618;HMAC-SHA1&amp;oauth_signature=tR3%2BTy81lMeYAr%2FFid0kMTYa%
&#8618;2FWM%3D&amp;oauth_timestamp=1191242096&amp;oauth_nonce=
&#8618;kllo9940pd9333jh&amp;oauth_version=1.0
</pre>
</p><p>
The Service Provider performs the same work flow to calculate the
signature of the request that the Consumer performs. It then compares its
calculated signature to the provided signature. If the two match, the
recipient can be confident that the request has not been modified in
transit. The Service Provider then responds with the requested pictures.
</p><p>
This process can be daunting to deal with
programmatically. There are
a number of libraries written for both the OAuth server and client for
quite a few programming languages.

Security Issues</h2></div></div><p>
The shared secret used to verify the request signature is called the
Consumer Secret. Because it is vital to the integrity of this
transaction, it is imperative that this piece of data be kept secret.
In the case of a Web-based Consumer, such as a Web service, it is easy to
keep the Consumer Secret safe. If the Consumer is a client-side
application, the Consumer Secret must be hard-coded in each copy of
the application. This means the Consumer Secret potentially
is discoverable, which compromises the integrity of any desktop
application.
</p><p>
There is a known session fixation attack vulnerability found in the
OAuth 1.0 protocol that allows an attacker to gain access to a
target's account. The attacker logs in to the Consumer site and
initiates the OAuth authorization process. The attacker saves the
authorization request page instead of clicking submit. This stores
the request token and secret. The attacker sends a link to a victim,
which, if clicked, will continue the authorization process as started
by the attacker. Once completed, the attacker will have access to the victim's
protected resources via the Consumer used.
