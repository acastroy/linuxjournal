The time between getting a new piece of hardware and seeing a
first shell prompt can be one of the most frustrating experiences for
embedded Linux developers. Buildroot can help reduce your frustration.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1342580.0x143a2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It all started when I ordered an ARM-based development board for
my FemtoLinux project, which is a Linux flavor specifically designed
for ultra-small systems. Initially, I played with the idea of simply
using a Linksys WRT router supported by an OpenWrt open-source project
for development. But eventually, I decided that because it is a commercial
project and development time is important, I was going to spend an extra
$100&ndash;$200 for a real development board with official Linux support, which
would come with everything that an embedded Linux developer would need:
cross-compiler toolchain, Linux sources and
embedded Linux distribution (at least, that's what I thought I would be getting).
If you're on a budget and looking for a cheap embedded board for your hobby project,
using a Linksys WRT router is not such a bad idea.
</p><p>
Choosing the right embedded Linux development
board deserves an article of its own, but for now, suffice it to say that
when you decide to use WRT, you should be prepared to build your software
development environment yourself and expect to get support from the
community. With a commercial board, I was expecting to receive it from the
vendor, but I didn't. The vendor's idea of Linux support turned out to
be just a list of kernel patches, forcing me to evaluate, choose and configure
an embedded Linux development environment for this board by myself, which
turned out to be quite an interesting and educational experience.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1342580.0x143a4b8"></a>
Embedded Linux Distributions</h2></div></div><p>
First, let's start with some basic terminology. An embedded Linux
distribution is quite different from the PC distributions you are used
to, such as Ubuntu or Fedora Core. It typically includes at least the
following components:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Cross-compiler toolchain for your target architecture, which is at least
gcc, g++ and ld. It usually runs on one architecture, but produces
binaries for a different architecture&mdash;x86 and ARM, respectively, in my
case, hence the term cross-compiler toolchain.
</p></li><li><p>
Kernel sources with a BSP (Board Support Package) for your board.
</p></li><li><p>
Filesystem skeleton&mdash;that is, /bin, /etc with all the standard
configuration files, such as /etc/fstab, /etc/inittabe and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
Applications&mdash;init and shell as a bare minimum, but most people
will need more in order to do something useful.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Currently, the two most widely used embedded Linux distributions are
OpenEmbedded and Buildroot. This article is about Buildroot, as that's 
the one I am most familiar with and naturally the one I used in my
project. Buildroot's biggest advantage is its simplicity and flexibility,
which are important if you are going to do some kernel hacking or
other low-level development. If, on the other hand, you are an embedded
application developer, OpenEmbedded certainly is a viable choice as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1342580.0x143a988"></a>
Buildroot</h2></div></div><p>
Even though you may not have heard of Buildroot before, it's actually
not a new project. It has been around for many years, most of the time
under the name of uClinux. Initially, uClinux was an effort to port the Linux
kernel to processors without an MMU, such as the Motorola MC68328. However,
it eventually expanded beyond that, adding support for more processors,
a binary format for MMU-less systems and more userland capabilities,
including a libc flavor specifically designed for low memory
systems&mdash;uClibc. Eventually, it evolved into one of the more-advanced
and easy-to-use embedded Linux distributions. 
</p><p>
This is where the confusion started,
as people used the name uClinux to refer both to the MMU-less CPU
kernel support and the embedded distribution, which were two quite
different things. The fact that many MMU-less patches (the whole
armnommu architecture support, for instance) eventually were included
in the standard kernel tree added to the confusion as well. Finally,
the embedded Linux distribution part was split into a different project
called Buildroot. uClibc development continued separately, and the
parent uClinux Project somewhat lost its momentum.
</p><p>
From the Buildroot Web site: &ldquo;Buildroot is a set of Makefiles and patches
that makes it easy to generate a cross-compilation toolchain and root
filesystem for your target Linux system using the uClibc C library.&rdquo; This
is not entirely correct, as it also supports (to some extent, as you
will see later) other libc flavors, such as glibc. It works with many
embedded CPUs, including ARM, MIPS and PowerPC.
</p><p>
If you want to get started with Buildroot, download the tarball, extract
it and run <tt  >make help</tt> from its root directory. If this all looks familiar
to you, wait till you run <tt  >make menuconfig</tt>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10795f1.large.jpg"><img src="10795f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Buildroot Main Menu
</p></div></div><p>
As you already may have guessed, Buildroot uses the same Makefile
infrastructure as the Linux kernel to configure and build everything,
including applications and libraries. The usual sequence of commands is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make clean
make menuconfig
make
</pre>
</p><p>
The first one is important if you are going to change some configuration
parameters&mdash;incremental building may or may not work in this case.
Initially,
I was going to recommend that you start working with some default configuration,
by running, for instance, <tt  >make
integrator926_defconfig</tt>, which should
configure Buildroot for the Integrator ARM reference board. However, it
turns out that as Buildroot development moved forward, most of the default
configurations somehow lagged behind and currently do not work out of
the box. I suggest you run <tt  >make menuconfig</tt>, and choose the following
options manually:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Target architecture: arm.
</p></li><li><p>
Target Architecture Variant: arm926t.
</p></li><li><p>
Kernel: same version as Linux headers.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
And, go over the other parameters and check for others that you may want or need to modify.
Be careful when you do so, and always save your latest working configuration
(the .config file). It is very easy to end up with a nonworking
configuration.
</p><p>
Buildroot configuration options can be divided roughly into hardware-,
build-process- and software-related, while software-related options can
be divided further into kernel, toolchain and packages.
</p><p>
Hardware options are the &ldquo;Target Architecture&rdquo; that defines your CPU core
(ARM, MIPS and so on). &ldquo;Target Architecture Variant&rdquo; defines the exact
CPU you are using, and &ldquo;Target Options&rdquo; defines board-related
parameters, such as UART baud rate and so on. You hopefully should know your
hardware parameters, and there is not much to add here, except that for the
ARM architecture, I suggest using EABI and making sure you use the
same ABI convention everywhere.
</p><p>
If you are running Buildroot for the first time, you probably should avoid
changing the &ldquo;Build options&rdquo;. These options probably are okay the way they
are; the only thing you may want to change is the &ldquo;Number of jobs to
run simultaneously&rdquo; if your build PC is a multicore system.
Also, choose &ldquo;build packages with debugging symbols&rdquo; if you
want to
debug some of the pre-installed applications.
</p><p>
Remember, in order to build the kernel and software packages,
Buildroot first needs to build the cross-compiler toolchain for your
hardware. The Toolchain menu allows you to choose the gcc version and
other toolchain-related parameters. The wrong toolchain configuration can
lead to some very weird errors, so be careful. By default, Buildroot
builds its own toolchain and works with uClibc. There is an option to
work with an external toolchain, which can be glibc-based, but that's
beyond the scope of this article, so you should set &ldquo;Toolchain
type&rdquo; to
&ldquo;Buildroot toolchain&rdquo;. You can change the gcc, binutils, uClibc and kernel
headers (but not the kernel itself) versions from this menu. You also
can decide to compile the C++ (g++) compiler and gdb support (gdbserver for the
target and gdb client for the host or a standalone gdb for the target),
which is probably something you are going to need. All the other options
are better left alone at this stage.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Package selection for the target&rdquo; is where you get to choose what software
components you want as part of your embedded filesystem image. This
is where you can experiment relatively freely&mdash;even if you select an
application that's not supported on your hardware or with the particular
Linux and gcc versions that you chose, it's easy to find the problematic
application and disable it. 
</p><p>
First, there is BusyBox. It deserves an
article of its own, but basically, it's a collection of standard Linux
utilities (such as shell and init), optimized for low memory footprint
systems. You can start by creating a filesystem with just BusyBox.
It contains everything you need in order to boot and verify that your
system is working. Later, you can add more packages, ranging
from the MySQL or SQLite databases to the VLC and MPlayer media players,
as well as Perl, Python and many others.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;Target filesystem options&rdquo; allow you to choose the type of filesystem
image. Pretty much all the commonly used (in the embedded world) filesystems are
supported, including: cramfs, squashfs, jffs2, romfs and ext2.
</p><p>
If you just want to experiment or prefer to create the filesystem image
manually (if you are using some rare unsupported filesystem, such as
yaffs2), you can choose the &ldquo;tar the root filesystem&rdquo; option, which will
create a tar archive with your filesystem. For some unknown reason,
bootloader configuration also is found under this menu (only Das U-Boot
is supported for now), but I'll skip this one, assuming you have a
working bootloader already.
</p><p>
The last menu is &ldquo;Kernel&rdquo;, which is optional. In case you are 
interested only in application development, choosing the right kernel headers
(see above) is enough. If you decide to modify the kernel, remember to
keep the kernel version and the kernel headers version (in the Toolchain menu)
in sync.
</p><p>
When you are finished, exit menuconfig, and run <tt  >make</tt>. Buildroot
automatically will download everything it needs, compile it and
eventually create the filesystem image in the output/images/
directory. If you want to modify something in the filesystem image,
for example, to change the IP address of your system, you can modify
the filesystem skeleton directory tree, which is usually located in
target/generic/target_busybox_skeleton. Note that if you are not using
BusyBox, or if your hardware platform has its own filesystem tree skeleton,
this location can be different.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1342580.0x143bb10"></a>
uClibc, BusyBox and Kernel Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
When you gain enough experience with Buildroot and decide you are
brave enough to modify some of the uClibc, BusyBox and/or kernel parameters,
the way to do it is to compile Buildroot with default settings for all
three, and after
that, run the following commands to modify the parameters and eventually
recompile everything:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make uclibc-menuconfig
make busybox-menuconfig
make linux26-menuconfig
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the last one will work only after you enable the
Linux kernel option in the main Buildroot configuration menu. Chances
are that you already know how to configure the kernel, and uClibc
configuration rarely requires tweaking, unless you want to compile out
some functionality in order to save memory, so I'm going to look at BusyBox
configuration only.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10795f2.large.jpg"><img src="10795f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. BusyBox Configuration Menu
</p></div></div><p>
The BusyBox menu can be divided into settings and applets. I
concentrate on the latter, as that's probably what you would want to
modify first. Applets are applications in BusyBox parlance, with one small
difference. In order to save space, BusyBox usually is installed as a
single binary that includes all the utilities you decided to compile:
shell, ping, gzip and so on. You can launch an individual applet either by giving
its name as an argument to BusyBox&mdash;<tt  >busybox
ping</tt>, for instance&mdash;or you
can create a symbolic link, <tt  >ln -s /bin/ping
/bin/busybox</tt>, and BusyBox
will choose the correct applet automatically, depending on the link from
which it
was executed. BusyBox installation automatically creates links for
all the compiled applets. If you are curious, you can run it without any
parameters to see what applets were compiled in. You should
have no difficulty in choosing the right set of applets for your project.
The only thing worth mentioning is the shell. BusyBox does not support
standard shells such as bash or tcsh; instead, you get to choose between
ash, hush and msh with ash being the closest to bash and
the one I always work with. Note that even though standard bash is not
part of BusyBox, it is supported by Buildroot if you need it.
</p><p>
When you are finished configuring your embedded system, run
<tt  >make</tt> to
compile everything. Now you are ready to program your newly compiled
kernel and filesystem images to your board and boot. Actual Flash
programming depends on your system, bootloader, type of Flash and so on, and
it is beyond the scope of this article.
</p><p>
If you want to compile your own applications, you can (and should) use
the toolchain created by Buildroot. You can get (or build) a different
toolchain, but if it is not based on uClibc or if it was compiled with different
kernel headers, it may not work. All you have to do in order to use the
Buildroot toolchain is add the output/staging/usr/bin/ directory
to your path and then simply run
<tt  >arm-linux-uclibcgnueabi-gcc</tt>.
</p><p>
The important point to remember is that Buildroot is not fool-proof in
the sense that it is relatively easy to create a configuration that won't
work or even compile. You should not expect every parameter combination
to work, and always keep your last working configuration file. The upside
is that there is a large and active community behind this project,
which will be happy to help.

BSP</b></p><p>
BSP stands for Board Support Package. The term is somehow associated
with RTOSes, such as VxWorks. Therefore, some people prefer the more
&ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; LSP (Linux Support Package). Anyhow, the BSP is a set
of usually small kernel and bootloader modifications specific to your
hardware. Intel x86 developers take for granted that all x86 systems
have the same basic hardware and peripheral interface, which is not the
case on embedded systems. BSP development usually includes fixing memory
mappings, configuring interrupt controllers and development of at least the
following basic drivers: serial (for console), network and Flash.

ARM ABI</b></p><p>
An Application Binary Interface (ABI) describes the low-level interface
between an application and an operating system and hardware. ARM Linux
supports Old ABI (OABI) and Embedded ABI (EABI). OABI is deprecated, and
it is recommended that you use EABI. As this parameter affects the kernel,
the compiler and the standard libraries, it is important to use the same
ABI everywhere, even though mixing ABIs may be supported. Compared
to OABI, EABI defines a more-efficient system call convention, improves
floating-point performance, changes structure packing, removes the minimal
four-byte size limitation and some other minor improvements.
