Figuring out how to calculate the year for a given date and day of
week is a task that's not as easy as it sounds.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a28580.0x1b203b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I received a very interesting note from a reader&mdash;a note that referred to a very
interesting problem:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Many UNIX commands (for example, <tt  >last</tt>) and log files
show brain-dead date strings,
such as &ldquo;Thu Feb 24&rdquo;. Does anybody out there have a script that will
convert that to a year, given a five-year interval and defaulting to the
present?
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Given a day of the week, a month and a day, is it possible to 
calculate quickly the most recent year in the past when that particular date
occurred on that day of the week? Of course it is!
</p><p>
Various formulas exist for calculating this sort of thing, but I
realized pretty quickly that the handy cal utility can do the
work for us. If you haven't experimented with it, you'll be
surprised at what it can do. Here are two quick, relevant examples:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cal
     March 2011
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
      1  2  3  4  5
6  7  8  9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24 25 26
27 28 29 30 31 

$ cal mar 2007
     March 2007
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
            1  2  3
4  5  6  7  8  9 10
11 12 13 14 15 16 17
18 19 20 21 22 23 24
25 26 27 28 29 30 31
</pre>
</p><p>
Any light bulb starting to glow for you? If you know the month and day, you
simply can go backward looking at that month's day-of-week layout
until finally you find a match.
</p><p>
In a rudimentary fashion, the basic idea can be illustrated with a loop,
like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
repeat
  cal $month $year | grep $day
  if day-of-week matches
     echo date $month $day most recently occurred in $year
  else
     year=$(( $year - 1 ))
end repeat
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, the problem is a bit more complicated (as they always are),
partially because of the complexity of calculating what day a specific date
occurs in the cal output. There's another complication too,
however; the requested date actually might have occurred in the current
year, so it's not as simple as starting with the year 2010 and going
backward.

Normalizing Data</h2></div></div><p>
The first task is to figure out how to get the information from the user.
We'll have only three input parameters and do relatively little testing
for misspelled day names and so on:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $# -ne 3 ] ; then
  echo "Usage: $(basename $0) weekday month day"
  echo "  (example: $(basename $0) wed aug 3  )"
  exit 1
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
That's straightforward and pretty typical, offering a nice usage tip if
you forget how to use the script. As is typical of scripts, we return a
nonzero result upon error too.
</p><p>
We can't work with completely arbitrary data, however, so when we grab
the first few parameters, we'll transliterate them into lowercase and
chop off all but the first three letters:


<pre     class="programlisting">
weekday=$(echo $1 | tr '[[:upper:]]' '[[:lower:]]'; | cut -c1-3)
  month=$(echo $2 | tr '[[:upper:]]' '[[:lower:]]'; | cut -c1-3)
    day=$3
</pre>
</p><p>
Given &ldquo;Monday, February 8&rdquo;, it'd be converted automatically to
&ldquo;mon&rdquo; and &ldquo;feb&rdquo; for subsequent testing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a28580.0x1b20e58"></a>
The Current Date</h2></div></div><p>
We also need the current date fields for testing, and to do this, I'll
demonstrate a very neat trick of <tt  >date</tt> that makes this incredibly
efficient:


<pre     class="programlisting">
eval $(date "+thismonth=%m; thisday=%d; thisyear=%Y")
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >eval</tt> function interprets its argument as if it were a direct
script command. More interesting, <tt  >date</tt> can output arbitrary
formats (as documented in <tt  >strftime</tt> if you want to read the man
page) by using the + prefix, with %m the month number, %d the day
of the month and %Y the year. The result is that
<tt  >date</tt> creates the
string:

<pre     class="programlisting">
thismonth=03; thisday=01; thisyear=2011
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a28580.0x1b21278"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which then is interpreted by the shell to create and instantiate the three
named variables. Neat, eh?
</p><p>
It turns out that users can specify a month by name or number on the command
line. If it's already a number, it'll survive the transforms
intact. If it's a name though, we also need the number, so we can
figure out whether the date specified could be earlier this year. There are
several ways
to do this, including a case statement, but that's a lot of work.
Instead, I'll lean on sed as I quite frequently do:

<pre     class="programlisting">
monthnum=$(echo $month | sed
's/jan/1/;s/feb/2/;s/mar/3/;s/apr/4/;s/may/5/;s/jun/
&#8618;6/;s/jul/7/;s/aug/8/;s/sep/9/;s/oct/10/;s/
&#8618;nov/11/;s/dec/12/')
</pre>
</p><p>
Here's where a misspelled month name is a problem, but that's a
challenge beyond the scope of this script. For now, however, we'll just
roll with it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1a28580.0x1b21488"></a>
Could the Date Occur in the Current Year?</h2></div></div><p>
The next set of tests is one I rewrote a couple times to ensure that I
wasn't tripping myself up, because my first thought simply was to use a
test like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $month -le $thismonth -a $day -le $thisday ]
</pre>
</p><p>
But, then I realized that in edge cases it wouldn't actually work
properly. For example, let's say it's April 4 and you're
checking for March 11. The month test succeeds, but the day test
fails&mdash;not
what we want. Instead, let's use a cascading set of conditional tests:


<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $monthnum -gt $thismonth ] ; then
  # month is in the future, can't be this year
  mostrecent=$(( $thisyear - 1 ))
elif [ $monthnum -eq $thismonth -a $day -gt $thisday ] ; then
  # right month, but seeking a date in the future
  mostrecent=$(( $thisyear - 1 ))
else
  mostrecent=$thisyear
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
With just this much code, we can at least test the normalization of data
input and comparison tool. I ran this set of tests on March 1, by the way:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ whatyear.sh Monday Aug 3
Decided that for 8/3 we're looking at year 2010
$ sh whatyear.sh mon jan 9
Decided that for 1/9 we're looking at year 2011
$ whatyear.sh mon mar 1
Decided that for 3/1 we're looking at year 2011
$ whatyear.sh mon mar 2
Decided that for 3/2 we're looking at year 2010
</pre>
</p><p>
It correctly identified that the current date could be a match, but that
the subsequent day (mar 2) had to be in the previous year for it to be a
possibility.
</p><p>
Good. Next month, we'll put the rest of the LEGO pieces in the model and
have a working script. The big task left? Parsing the output of
cal to figure out the day of the week for a given date.
