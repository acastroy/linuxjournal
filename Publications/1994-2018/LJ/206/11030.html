<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #206, June 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Ahmed S. Darwish</b></span> recently initiated an abortive effort to improve the
way <span   class="bold"><b>system crashes</b></span> were logged. When a system, particularly a laptop,
crashes very early in the boot process, typically no record is
kept. Ahmed's idea was to rely on BIOS routines to write logging
information to disk even if a crash occurs almost immediately. There
was a lot of interest in Ahmed's work, since it could be a significant
aid to debugging. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> torpedoed the idea, saying, &ldquo;No
way in hell do I want the situation of 'the system is screwed, so
let's overwrite the disk' to be something the kernel I release might
do. It's crazy. That disk is a lot more important than the kernel.&rdquo;
So clearly, this type of feature almost certainly will remain a
third-party patch for a long time to come.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>ARM architecture</b></span> has quite a few
implementations of the <span   class="bold"><b>clk
struct</b></span>, which annoyed <span   class="bold"><b>Jeremy
Kerr</b></span> and inspired him to rewrite them
all into a single generic implementation. A lot of folks pitched in
with suggestions. Some of the trickier points involved identifying the
proper way to tell when multiple devices were using a single clock. It
also was important to make sure that the generic code have appropriate
boundaries, so it would be easier to write special case code for the
systems that needed it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Oren Weil</b></span> of <span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> has submitted a patch to support Intel's new
<span   class="bold"><b>management engine</b></span>. Unfortunately, there
was a variety of problems with
the patch submission process itself, including leaving off the crucial
Signed-Off-By headers, among other things. So, much of the discussion
centered around that instead of the code. One key problem was that
patches are never supposed to break the kernel build. This is
essential even if subsequent patches would fix the build. The reason
is that developers need to be able to rely on &ldquo;git bisect&rdquo; to track
down bugs, and this is possible only if every version of the kernel
builds properly. This also makes for a cleaner development process in
general, in which no single project is stuck waiting for another
project to fix the build before it can continue doing its own
tests and development.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Thomas Gleixner</b></span> has revamped the <span   class="bold"><b>generic interrupt handling code</b></span> in
the kernel. This was partly done to clean up naming conventions so as
to be easier for developers to understand, but it also was done to
encapsulate the various features of the system, so developers couldn't
abuse them anymore&mdash;or at least so developers who abused them would be
easy to identify and stop. One of the goals is to extend the
IRQ handling code gradually to accommodate the special needs of all the various
projects out there, and that's more difficult to do when folks are
reaching their misshapen prongs into the guts of the code.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Eric Paris</b></span> wanted to re-introduce a
<span   class="bold"><b>global capabilities bounding set</b></span>
to make it possible to remove a capability from the system in such a
way that it could not be gotten back. The idea would be to remove some
key capabilities and then hand root access over to untrusted
entities. Eric's idea was that this would keep the system secure.
Unfortunately, Linux security is implemented primarily in terms of ways
to prevent root access, rather than ways to mitigate the effect of
granting root access. The assumption made by virtually all kernel
developers is that once a user has gained root access, that's the
ball game. So something like Eric's subtle manipulation of root
privileges does not ring true to most kernel folks.

Dropbox, or one of the alternatives like Ubuntu One or SparkleShare,
are great tools for keeping computers in sync. They offer some unique
abilities as well. Here are a few of our favorites:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Keep config folders, like Pidgin's .purple directory in your Dropbox,
and symlink to it in your home directory. It saves entering the same
information on your computers.
</p></li><li><p>
Have your home computer monitor a specific folder inside Dropbox for
torrent files. Then, whenever you want to download a torrent at home,
just put the torrent file into your folder on any computer, and it will
start downloading at home.
</p></li><li><p>
Keep your favorite desktop wallpaper photos in Dropbox, so you
have access to all your NASA astronomy pictures on your various desktop
and laptop computers. (This works for non-NASA photos too, but why
would you want non-space-based wallpaper?)
</p></li><li><p>
Use Dropbox in combination with Calibre and Calibre2opds to keep your
e-book library on-line and always accessible. It makes downloading a book
from your collection simple when you're on vacation and forget to pack
enough books.

Whether you prefer OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice, which currently still are pretty
similar, out of the box, they are missing some of the conveniences installed by
their commercial counterparts. Granted, they are fully functional, but if you
want a robust clip-art library and a decent selection of document templates,
you'll want to add some extensions and templates.

<h2 class="title">Parallel Programming Crash Course</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #206, June 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've been covering various scientific programs the past few months,
but sometimes it's hard to find a package that does what you need. In those
cases, you need to go ahead and write your own code. When you are involved
with heavy-duty scientific computing, you usually need to go to parallel
computing in order to get the runtimes down to something reasonable. This
month, I give a crash course in parallel programming so you
can get a feel for what is involved.
</p><p>
There are two broad categories of parallel programs: shared memory
and message passing. You likely will see both types being used in
various scientific arenas. Shared-memory programming is when all of
the processors you are using are on a single box. This limits you
as to how big your problem can be. When you use message passing,
you can link together as many machines as you have access to over
some interconnection network. 
</p><p>
Let's start by looking at message-passing parallel programming. The most common version in use today is MPI
(Message Passing Interface). MPI is actually a specification, so 
many different implementations are available, including Open MPI,
MPICH and LAM, among others. These implementations are available for C,
C++ and FORTRAN. Implementations also are available for Python,
OCaml and .NET.
</p><p>
An MPI program consists of multiple processes (called slots), running on
one or more machines. Each of these processes can communicate with all
other processes. Essentially, they are in a fully connected network. Each
process runs a full copy of your program as its executable content and
runs independently of the others. The parallelism comes into play when
these processes start sending messages to each other. 
</p><p>
Assuming you
already have some MPI code, the first step in using it is to compile
it. MPI implementations include a set of wrapper scripts that handle all
of the compiler and linker options for you. They are called mpicc, mpiCC,
mpif77 and mpif90, for C, C++, FORTRAN 77 and FORTRAN 90, respectively. You can add
extra options for your compiler as options to the wrapper scripts. One
very useful option is <tt  >-showme</tt>. This option simply prints out the full
command line that would be used to invoke your compiler. This is useful
if you have multiple compilers and/or libraries on your system, and you
need to verify that the wrapper is doing the right thing.
</p><p>
Once your code is compiled, you need to run it. You don't actually
run your program directly. A support program called mpirun 
takes care of setting up the system and running your code. You
need to tell mpirun how many processors you want to run and where they
are located. If you are running on one machine, you can hand in the
number of processors with the option <tt  >-np X</tt>. If you are running over
several machines, you can hand in a list of hostnames either on the
command line or in a text file. If this list of hostnames has repeats,
mpirun assumes you want to start one process for each repeat.
</p><p>
Now that you know how to compile and run your code, how do you actually
write an MPI program? The first step needs to initialize the MPI
subsystem. There is a function to do this, which in C is this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

int MPI_Init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);

</pre>
</p><p>
Until you call this function, your program is running a single thread
of execution. Also, you can't call any other MPI functions before this,
except for <tt  >MPI_Initialized</tt>. Once you run
<tt  >MPI_Init</tt>, MPI starts up all
of the parallel processes and sets up the communication network. After
this initialization work is finished, you are running in parallel, with
each process running a copy of your code. 
</p><p>
When you've finished all of
your work, you need to shut down all of this infrastructure cleanly. The
function that does this is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int MPI_Finalize();
</pre>
</p><p>
Once this finishes, you are back to running a single thread of
execution. After calling this function, the only MPI functions that you
can call are <tt  >MPI_Get_version</tt>,
<tt  >MPI_Initialized</tt> and
<tt  >MPI_Finalized</tt>.
</p><p>
Remember that once your code goes parallel, each
processor is running a copy of your code. If so, how does each copy
know what it should be doing? In order to have each process do something
unique, you need some way to identify different processes. This can be
done with the function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_Comm comm, int *rank);
</pre>
</p><p>
This function will give a unique identifier, called the rank, of the
process calling it. Ranks are simply integers, starting from 0 to N&ndash;1,
where N is the number of parallel processes. 
</p><p>
You also may need to know
how many processes are running. To get this, you would need to call
the function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
int MPI_Comm_size(MPI_Comm comm, int *size);
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you've initialized the MPI subsystem and found out who you are and
how many processes are running. The next thing you likely will need to
do is to send and receive messages. The most basic method for sending
a message is:


<pre     class="programlisting">
int MPI_Send(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype type, 
 &#8618;int dest, int tag, MPI_Comm comm);
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, you need a buffer (<tt  >buf</tt>) containing
<tt  >count</tt> elements of
type <tt  >type</tt>. The parameter <tt  >dest</tt> is the rank of the process that you are
sending the message to. You also can label a message with the parameter
<tt  >tag</tt>. Your code can decide to do something different based on the tag
value you set. The last parameter is the communicator, which I'll look
at a little later. On the receiving end, you would need to call:


<pre     class="programlisting">
int MPI_Recv(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype type, 
 &#8618;int source, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status);
</pre>
</p><p>
When you are receiving a message, you may not necessarily care who
sent it or what the tag value is. In those cases, you can set these
parameters to the special values MPI_ANY_SOURCE and MPI_ANY_TAG. You 
then can check what the actual values were after the fact by looking at the
status struct. The status contains the values:

<pre     class="programlisting">
status-&gt;MPI_source
status-&gt;MPI_tag
status-&gt;MPI_ERROR
</pre>
</p><p>
Both of these functions are blocking. This means that when you send a
message, you end up being blocked until the message has finished being
sent. Alternatively, if you try to receive a message, you will block
until the message has been received completely. Because these calls
block until they complete, it is very easy to cause deadlocks where,
for example, two processes are both waiting for a message to arrive
before any messages get sent. They end up waiting forever. So if you
have problems with your code, these calls usually are the first places
to look.
</p><p>
These functions are point-to-point calls. But, what if you want to talk
to a group of other processes? MPI has a broadcast function:


<pre     class="programlisting">
int MPI_Bcast(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype type, 
 &#8618;int root, MPI_Comm comm);
</pre>
</p><p>
This function takes a buffer containing <tt  >count</tt>
elements of type <tt  >type</tt>
and broadcasts to all of the processors, including the root process. The
root process (from the parameter <tt  >root</tt>) is the
process that actually has
the data. All the others receive the data. They all call MPI_Bcast, and
the MPI subsystem is responsible for sorting out who has the data and
who is receiving. This call also sends the entire contents of the buffer
to all the processes, but sometimes you want each process to work on a chunk of
the data. In these cases, it doesn't make sense to send the entire data
buffer to all of them. There is an MPI function to handle this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
int MPI_Scatter(void *send, int sendcnt, MPI_Datatype type,
                void *recv, int recvcnt, MPI_Datatype type, int root,
                MPI_Comm comm);
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, they all call the same function, and the MPI subsystem is
responsible for sorting out which is root (the process with the data) and
which are receiving data. MPI then divides the send buffer into
even-size chunks and sends it out to all of the processes, including
the root process. Then, each process can work away on its chunk. When
they're done, you can gather up all the results with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
int MPI_Gather(void *send, int sendcnt, MPI_Datatype type,
               void *recv, int recvcnt, MPI_Datatype type, int root,
               MPI_Comm comm);
</pre>
</p><p>
This is a complete reversal of MPI_Scatter. In this case, all the processes send
their little chunks, and the root process gathers them all up and puts
them in its receive buffer.
</p><p>
Taking all of the information from above and combining it together, you
can put together a basic boilerplate example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;mpi.h&gt;
// Any other include files

int main(int argc, char **argv){
   int id,size;
   // all of your serial code would
   // go here
   MPI_Init(&amp;argc, &amp;argv);
   MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;id);
   MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &amp;size);
   // all of your parallel code would
   // go here
   MPI_Finalize();
   // any single-threaded cleanup code
   // goes here
   exit(0);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Hopefully, you now feel more comfortable with MPI programs. I looked at
the most basic elements here, but if you feel inspired, you should grab a
good textbook and see what other functions are available to you. If not,
you at least should be able to read existing MPI code and have a good
idea of what it's trying to do. As always, if you'd
like to see a certain area covered in this space, feel free to let me know.

<h2 class="title">Scrivener, Now for Linux!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #206, June 2011</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The folks over at <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com" target="_self">www.literatureandlatte.com</a> have a rather nifty writer's
tool called Scrivener. For years, it's been an OS X-only program
for novelists and screenwriters that acts like a project management
tool for big writing projects. Linux users may be familiar with
Writer's Caf&eacute; from <a href="http://www.writerscafe.co.uk" target="_self">www.writerscafe.co.uk</a>, which is a similar program.
Although Scrivener is a little more expensive ($45 vs. $40 for Writer's
Caf&eacute;), its features make it something any novelist should check out.
And, if you try it during the beta period, Scrivener is free.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11030scrivenerf1.large.jpg"><img src="11030scrivenerf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, users with existing licenses for the OS X version
of Scrivener cannot transfer that license to the Linux version.
Perhaps once the final version is released, the Literature and Latte
folks will change their minds. Either way, if you're a writer, you'll
want to check out Scrivener or Writer's Caf&eacute;. Both are neat packages,
and now both are Linux-compatible!
