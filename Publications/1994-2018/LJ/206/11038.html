A chat with Matt Bunting, developer of the hexapod robot.

Linux is ubiquitous these days. It powers large-scale HPC systems and small
embedded devices&mdash;from space to underground. And although it's quite easy (to
some degree) to build an unmanned device like a rover or to run a helicopter 
with Linux, it still is a tough job to create a robot that behaves like a
biological object. Fortunately, there's a will and there's a way&mdash;and
there's Linux. The latter became the core of the hexapod&mdash;the robotics device that
resembles a spider, developed by Matt Bunting.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11038f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Matt, you're the creator of the
hexapod robot that runs on Linux. But before talking about the robot, tell us about your Linux
experience and the role Linux plays in your life.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> The field of robotics is what introduced me to the world of Linux. I had
previously done basic development in UNIX, so the transition of switching my
OS to Linux was seamless. Currently, I use Linux for most things involving
development, such as robotics projects and tinkering around with OpenCV. I
have a couple Atom-based Linux computers at my house running a custom
Webcam-based security system.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> What is the hexapod in general, and what ideas were behind its design?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> A basic hexapod is a six-legged platform. Each leg can be configured in
any number of ways. One such way is a Stewart platform. The version I made is
a portable platform (body) with non-rigid feet. Each foot in a portable
platform may have any number of degrees of freedom (DOF). Some of the simplest
hexapods have three total degrees of freedom, but these are constrained to
very simple motions like moving only forward or backward. For incredible
flexibility of the platform, three DOF (18 total) are needed per leg to
position each &ldquo;foot&rdquo; at nearly any given (x,y,z) coordinate. This allows the
hexapod to have complete flexibility of the body, so the body may translate or
tilt in any direction, in any combination. Recently, there has been an interest
in four degrees of freedom per leg. This does not increase the amount of body
control, but it can extend the range. I wanted to design the 18 DOF for the best
flexibility of the body to use the hexapod for various applications, from
implementation of neural networks (NNs) to terrain adaptation methods.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11038f2.large.jpg"><img src="11038f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The Hexapod looks like a real biological spider.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> And you have succeeded in this
design&mdash;a spider with 18 DOF, right?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> I would certainly say so. Currently, it is a very solid design that can
take a quite a bit of abuse. Though it is fully functional, I'm always looking
for ways to upgrade it. I have some ideas floating around, but haven't
seriously integrated anything yet.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Can someone achieve these goals with another kind of a robot, say with a
rover?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> Since my goal was to research legged locomotion techniques, a wheeled
rover doesn't make sense for what I want to do in robotics. Sometimes I am
asked what the practical applications of a hexapod are, but for many cases, a
hexapod is impractical. Mine is terribly power-inefficient, and the learning
techniques I have used take too long to be effective for anything
practical, like sending a hexapod on a space mission or to fix an underwater
bursted pipe. 
</p><p>
The legged aspect and complexity of a hexapod is interesting in
the area of machine learning because the complexity makes it difficult to
learn efficiently. Wheeled robots may learn locomotion very quickly, which does
not generalize the effectiveness of the algorithms involved. One aspect of
machine learning I was interested in included the ability of the machine to
re-learn after damage to the robot. For example, if the robot learned to walk,
began walking in a dangerous environment and a rock were to crush two legs,
then the algorithms implemented could sense that the previously used motions
are not very effective, and it could begin to learn an optimal walking policy
based on the new configuration.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Describe how you &ldquo;teach&rdquo;
a hexapod to walk.
Previously, you mentioned NNs and adaptation methods. Do you load some basic
behavior functions into software, and later the spider tries to find the optimal
walk for every kind of a terrain, or is there another approach?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> I have, so far, explored two different
learning mechanisms, both of which learn
in very different ways. The first was a reinforcement learning technique
called Q-Learning with Softmax action selection. Basically, the hexapod would
experiment between different motor states. Starting from one state, the
algorithm applies Softmax to the current Q-matrix for action selection
probability and chooses one based on a random number generator. The values in
the Q-matrix with higher values (good transitions to move forward) 
are more likely to be selected, while others (poor transitions, like moving backward)
are not as likely to be selected. Once an action is selected, the hexapod
first takes an image using a Webcam pointing in the forward direction, then
performs the action. The action moves the hexapod into a new state. In the new
state, another image is taken. The state transition reward is measured by the
difference between the two images. 
</p><p>
I used a function in OpenCV to measure
optic flow. The resulting vector field from the optic flow function is run
through some simple math to determine how the hexapod moved based on the
overall directionality of the vectors. For example, if the resulting image had
a sense of &ldquo;zooming in&rdquo; from moving the hexapod forward, all the vectors
would point outward from the center of the image. This translates to a high
reward. If the vectors are pointing toward the center, the hexapod moved
backward, resulting in a cost or negative reward. I also included twisting of
the body and translational movements of the camera as negative rewards because
the goal was to get it to walk forward very smoothly. 
</p><p>
The reward value is used
to update the Q-Matrix. Based on the transition reward and possible
future rewards from the new state, the Q-value is updated. Softmax action
selection gives a nice balance between explorative and exploitative behavior.
Once a gait is well learned, there is a small probability that the
hexapod will explore other state transitions. If, however, the hexapod were to
break a leg and apply a previously learned method, the reward values
would decrease tremendously. The newly updated Q-matrix would result in a low
probability of exploring the previously learned transitions and begin to
experiment with others.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11038f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Q-Learning Technique Algorithm
</p></div></div><p>
The NN is very much different. I based a good portion of the network on
Randall Beer's work on a neural-network-based hexapod. The neurons I used were
different, more biologically influenced. I believe that Beer used continuous
neurons, which were differentiable, but the ones I used were integrated and
fired with adaptation. They don't truly mimic biology, but they are much closer
than continuous-based neurons. I constructed something similar to Beer's
network, but I have to add additional neurons to move the legs around. The
network is based around an oscillator called a Central Pattern Generator
(CPG), also called a Pacemaker Neuron. These are created by mutually
inhibiting two neurons. One begins to fire, preventing the other from firing,
but slows down due to adaptation, and eventually the other neuron will begin to
fire, inhibiting the first one, and so on. These CPGs are used to drive other
neurons that operate the legs. 
</p><p>
To learn the weights for each
connection correctly, a genetic algorithm was used to train the weights. I used a
population size of 16, and the fitness function was based on running the
hexapod for 10 seconds and measuring the traveled distance and resulting
direction angle. The closest the resulting angle to the starting orientation
and the farthest distance traveled resulted in the best fitness value.
The
hexapod learned to walk very effectively after 100 generations.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> You mean 100 iterations of the learning, or 100 steps here?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> In genetic algorithms, this is the number of generations, which can be
thought of as iterations in a way. In each generation, a new population size
of 16 is created.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Several sources say that the robot was
assembled from trash parts. Is that true?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> This is a bit misinterpreted by many
people, because they think that the
videos I posted on YouTube are where I am at now, not where I was when I
started. The hexapod began as a project for a class, and I had limited money,
time and resources. I (like any hobbyist, maker or hacker) have a drawer full
of parts I've been collecting for years. I started this drawer when I was nine
years old, and my mentor at the time called it the
&ldquo;things-I-don't-know-what-they-are-but-they-may-be-useful-someday drawer&rdquo;. So when the time came for the
class project, I searched through all the servo motors, breadboards and metal
brackets I had and threw together a hexapod of mismatched legs to implement
the reinforcement technique called Q-learning. This was not the hexapod I put
on YouTube. 
</p><p>
The professor of the class, Dr Tony Lewis, really liked the
project and was looking to hire an undergrad into his lab. I also needed
a job so he hired me into his lab, the Robotics and Neural Systems Laboratory
(RNSL). At RNSL, there is a Dimension 3-D printer, so I took advantage of it and
saved up my money to buy matching motors. I gave the hexapod a complete
makeover (including a new Atom-based fit-PC2) with no junk parts, and then I
posted a video on YouTube. This is the video that Stewart Christie of Intel
saw. Also, the video shows no learning at all. It was just a demonstration to
forum members at <a href="http://hexapodrobot.com/forum" target="_self">hexapodrobot.com/forum</a> of my platform in action.

The initial version of a hexapod was made of metal brackets, breadboards
and servos.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Linux is the key to success for the
hexapod. Why did you decide to use
Linux, and what particular distribution was the final choice?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> I wanted ultimate onboard computational power for vision processing, which
led to fit-PC2 from CompuLab. At RNSL, Ubuntu is the distribution of choice
and is used for everything from simulations to direct robot operation. We use
Linux because of the flexibility and the available resources.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> The main hardware unit, an
Atom motherboard, was donated by Intel.
Could you shed some light on your cooperation with Intel?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> Originally, I had purchased the computer before any cooperation with Intel.
At the time of searching for an embedded solution, I was looking into Gumstix
boards and Via processor-based boards. These were great for kinematics
integration, but for heavy computation of vision, I needed something even more
powerful. Fortunately at the time, CompuLab had just released its fit-PC2,
which is the ideal computer for robotics. Once I posted the video, a couple
days later, Stewart from Intel wrote a comment on my YouTube video regarding
interest in the hexapod. I contacted him, and after a month or so, he said that
Intel would want me to create two hexapods, one for tradeshows and
the other for me, but the Intel folks can borrow mine if they have
multiple demonstrations at the same time.

General Scheme of How the Robot Is Controlled
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Speaking practically, the hexapod is
actually a high-tech model, because
the use of 3-D Stratasys printers won't be available for casual amateurs.
You've made a model&mdash;that is, a framework and legs in CAD
software&mdash;printed it and
attached servos and a camera to the body and that's it. Am I missing something?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> 3-D printing has been becoming incredibly cheap, where hobbyists can make
their own home 3-D printer for around $1,000. The quality is not anywhere near
what the Stratasys machine can do that I use, but functional parts still
may be created. My hexapod is not very different functionally from other hexapods
that can be put together with off-the-shelf components, but since I had the
Stratasys machine at my disposal, I took full advantage of it and tried to make
complex, curved shapes. I actually used SolidWorks for the mechanical design,
because it is freely offered by my university, but I will have to look into
QCad.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> The robot without its middleware is just another embedded Linux device.
Did you use a specific software for your &ldquo;spider&rdquo;, or did you write
software for it?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> I developed all the software for the hexapod in C++, using OpenCV
libraries for simulations and vision processing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a3580.0x2b95338"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Building a Spider</b></p><p>
Here are the required resources to build a spider:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Framework: six servo motors AX-12/RX-10/RX-28 from Robotis, 3D-printed
casing.
</p></li><li><p>
Computing unit: one fit-PC2 motherboard based on Intel Atom Z530 from
CompuLab.
</p></li><li><p>

Distribution: Ubuntu Linux 9.08.
</p></li><li><p>
Software used: GEdit, OpenCV and C++.
</p></li><li><p>
Scientific field: neural networks and adaptation methods.
</p></li></ul></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Can you estimate how much time
(in hours) it took to
construct the hexapod (put together the mechanical and electrical parts) and
write the software itself?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> Ha ha. It is an enormous amount for
sure. I worked on it for hours a day,
weeks at a time. The original Q-Learning robot probably took 200 hours. Then I
gave it a makeover, which took maybe 100 hours, and then the other projects took maybe 80
each.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> You said previously that the operating system beneath the cover is
Ubuntu. What IDE did you use to write the robot's middleware&mdash;Qt,
WxWidgets,
ncurses or something else?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> I actually use only GEdit and purely in C++ using OpenCV libraries. The
simulations I built were done purely using OpenCV, drawing individual lines at
a time. I feel like I re-invent the wheel when I do this, but I sure learn a
lot!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11038f6.large.jpg"><img src="11038f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
First experiment is done in simulated environment.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Do you release schematics and
auxiliary software of a robot under the GPL or
under another license?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> I have been looking to release my kinematics code under a license, but I
know nothing in this area. Maybe <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> readers could point me in
the right direction?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> You're a senior student at the
University of Arizona, and this project is to
some degree your graduation work. Do you plan to continue its future
development?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> I look forward to implementing more functionality into the hexapod as a
graduate student at the University of Arizona. Currently, I am working on a
miniature version. I do want to explore the link between vision and
legged locomotion through the use of biologically inspired neural networks
further.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Where, in your opinion, can this
&ldquo;spider&rdquo; be used and be useful for
people?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> The hexapod could make a great
search-and-rescue-style robot. In a
natural disaster like an earthquake, it would be desirable to have a large
number of robots searching autonomously for survivors in a building turned to
rubble. The environment is treacherous though and could cause damage to the
robot. Once damage is inflicted upon the hexapod, a purely inverse
kinematic-based hexapod would be rendered useless. If, however, it could
re-learn, the
hexapod still could operate given its new configuration. Like I mentioned
previously though, it is more of a tool to explore machine learning techniques
and out of the research, hopefully discover faster algorithms. Hopefully, better
algorithms can be used for consumer-based robotics to increase the standard.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AB:</b></span> Do you plan to use the hexapod or your next prototype CrustCrawler in
autonomous walking research?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>MB:</b></span> Sure. The learning mechanisms I've implemented are more scientific, and I
certainly encourage everyone to explore science with robotics platforms, but
it is not necessarily the goal for the CrustCrawler platform. I see that as a
means of making it easy for anyone to get started in the field of hexapod
robotics. If the different geometry is more conducive to what I want the
hexapod to do, then I will, of course, use it. The hexapods are simply tools in
my mind for research. I certainly want my hexapods to be able to roam around
on their own and accomplish some task even if it is mundane. The nice thing
about the CrustCrawler hexapod and my personal hexapod is that they can be
easily interchanged, as they use motors that communicate using identical
protocols. All I have to do is change a few geometric calibration settings and
it will run just fine.
