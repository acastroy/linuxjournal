If you write code for Linux systems, chances are you will have used
the venerable GNU Debugger (GDB). Acting as a back end for many GUIs
and the interface to various JTAG debugging tools in the embedded world,
GDB is the foremost debugger for Linux. As of release 7.0, GDB gained
a compelling new capability: support for scripting debugging actions
using a Python interpreter. In this article, I take a look at how
to drive GDB using Python and apply this knowledge to the vexatious
issue of debugging an embedded Linux platform.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x174d460"></a>
The Challenge of Embedded Linux Debugging</h2></div></div><p>
Debugging Linux programs on an x86 PC platform, although not necessarily
easy, at least is well supported by a variety of tools. Most Linux
distributions package development and debugging tools to assist with
anything from profiling runtime performance through tracing memory
leaks and detecting deadlocks.
</p><p>
Embedded platforms are rarely so well served. Although a number of
projects seek to provide the kind of polish and integration for embedded
development that is taken for granted on the desktop, these are not yet
widely adopted in all areas of embedded Linux development. Many embedded
devices are developed using what effectively is a handcrafted Linux
distribution, closely tied to the specific goals of that device. The time
required to integrate a wide range of handy debugging tools into that
environment, especially in the fast-paced world of consumer electronics,
is an overhead few teams can meet.
</p><p>
Many embedded platforms seek to save on resource overhead through
the use of &ldquo;low-fat&rdquo; system libraries (such as uClibc in the place
of glibc), which may make the integration of some debugging tools more
difficult. Indeed, in some cases, the architecture of the CPU used by the
target platform will prevent the use of certain tools altogether. The
excellent Valgrind instrumentation framework, for example, has limited
support for the ARM architecture and no support at all for MIPS or
SuperH.
</p><p>
The nature of embedded devices often means that CPU cycles and memory are
scarce. Any debugging tool that weighs too heavily on either may make
its use impractical on an embedded device, especially when attempting
to debug race conditions and the like.
</p><p>
The net result of this inconsistent provision of debugging tools across
the embedded Linux world is that most developers have to makeshift
as best they can with the tools that are available. Happily, GDB is
widely available for embedded devices because it is easy to cross-compile
and supports a wide range of target architectures. And with the recent
integration of Python scripting support, GDB can extended beyond the
typical debugging tasks of single stepping and variable examination.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x174d7d0"></a>
Scripting GDB with Python</h2></div></div><p>
GDB has long supported extension via pre-canned sequences of debugger
commands. This ability makes it possible to automate certain parts of
a debugging work flow and even implement new debugger functions.
</p><p>
Integrating Python into GDB adds an extra dimension to the possibilities
of GDB scripting and extension. In addition to the simple functions and
flow control of GDB's native scripting language, the full power of the
Python language is made available.
</p><p>
The Python GDB API is presented as a Python module called gdb,
which provides access to GDB's internal representation of a process
under debugging. The module includes interfaces to process information,
threads, stack frames, values and types, functions, symbols and break
points. In addition, a mechanism is provided to inject commands into
the GDB command-line interface.
</p><p>
The result is that the internals of GDB are now available as a rich set
of libraries for programmatic driving of the debugger. This creates
a whole range of new opportunities for extension and automation. For
example, let's imagine you want to debug calls to malloc() in a large
application, but you're really interested only in calls from a certain
module. Ideally, you want to be able to break execution only when one
of the module's functions is in the backtrace at the point that malloc()
is called. The Python API gives you that flexibility.

Problem Code</h2></div></div><p>
To explore the use of Python within GDB, let's debug a small C
program, the code for which is shown in Listing 1. It performs the simple
task of printing the phrase &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; in a rather convoluted manner,
and it has at least one obvious bug. Besides being over-engineered for
the task at hand, hello_world.c makes use of two mutexes for serializing
access to different data structures, and not all users of these mutexes
agree on the order in which locks should be acquired. This quickly yields
a runtime deadlock.

Although hello_world.c is somewhat contrived, it does demonstrate the
kinds of runtime bugs that multithreaded applications can come across when
mutexes are required to protect data structures from different contexts.
</p><p>
Before reading any further, it is worth considering how you might debug
such a deadlock. On an x86 platform, you could consider using the
Valgrind framework's drd tool. Alternatively, you may choose to recompile
the code with different options to change the behavior. But what would
you do if Valgrind did not work on your platform, or if the code you
wanted to rebuild was a third-party library for which you had only
binaries?

Setting Up the Environment: the Embedded Platform</h2></div></div><p>
The example platform for this article uses a little-endian MIPS-based
System On a Chip (SOC) device. MIPS is widely used in home routers,
such as the popular Linksys WRT54G series, as well as in many set-top
box platforms for accessing digital television services. Our platform
has a fairly powerful 400MHz CPU, as well as 512MB of DDR RAM, making
it a quite capable embedded device. We can communicate with the platform
over a serial console and using an Ethernet port.
</p><p>
On the software side, our platform runs a 2.6 series Linux kernel that
has been extended by the SOC manufacturer to support the specific CPU
we are using. It has a fairly typical userspace based around uClibc and
BusyBox, along with a range of GNU utilities, such as awk and sed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x174dfb8"></a>
Setting Up the Environment: Cross-Compiling GDB</h2></div></div><p>
In order to run GDB on our embedded platform, we will make use of the
gdbserver tool for remote debugging. This allows us to run GDB on a
Linux PC, connecting to the embedded target using Ethernet. The protocol
GDB uses to communicate with gdbserver is compatible across releases,
so we can update the GDB installation on our host PC without needing to
install a new version of gdbserver on the target.
</p><p>
Because most distributions do not package GDB with MIPS architecture
support, we need to compile GDB from source. This is 
accomplished easily using the instructions in the source tarball, which can be
downloaded from the GDB Web site. If you get stuck with cross compilation
or with the GDB/gdbserver configuration, plenty of good
references exist on-line that will help; the Resources section for this
article lists
a few.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x174e118"></a>
Initial Debugging</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have GDB cross-compiled and installed, let's take a look
at debugging the deadlock on the embedded target.
</p><p>
First, run gdbserver on the target and attach to the deadlocked
process:

<pre     class="programlisting">

gdbserver :5555 --attach &lt;pid of process&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, fire up GDB on the host PC:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mipsel-linux-uclibc-gdb
</pre>
</p><p>
Once GDB is running, point it at the target's root filesystem and at
the file to debug:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) set solib-absolute-prefix /export/shared/rootfs
(gdb) file hello_world
(gdb)
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, tell GDB to attach to the process running on the target via
gdbserver:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) target remote 10.0.0.6:5555
(gdb)
</pre>
</p><p>
If all goes well, now you should be able to explore the running process a
little to see what is going on. Given that the process has deadlocked,
examining the state of the threads in the process is a good first port
of call:


<pre     class="programlisting">
(gdb) info threads
Id  Target Id   Frame
33  Thread 737  0x2aac1068 in __lll_lock_wait from libpthread.so.0
32  Thread 738  0x2aac1068 in __lll_lock_wait from libpthread.so.0
31  Thread 739  0x2aac1068 in __lll_lock_wait from libpthread.so.0
....
3   Thread 767  0x2aac1068 in __lll_lock_wait from libpthread.so.0
2   Thread 768  0x2aac1068 in __lll_lock_wait from libpthread.so.0
1   Thread 736  0x2aab953c in pthread_join from libpthread.so.0
(gdb)
</pre>
</p><p>
The omitted threads in the GDB output are all similarly blocking in
__lll_lock_wait(), somewhere in the depths of libpthread.so. Clearly,
some of these threads must be waiting for a mutex that another thread
has not given up&mdash;but which threads, and which mutex?
</p><p>
Some examination of the libpthread source in the uClibc tree shows us
that __lll_lock_wait() is a low-level wrapper around the Linux futex
system call. The prototype for this function is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
void __lll_lock_wait (int *futex, int private);
</pre>
</p><p>
On MIPS, the a0 register typically is used for the first argument
to a function. So if we examine a0 for each thread that is blocked in
__lll_lock_wait(), we should get a good idea of which threads are waiting
on which mutexes. That's a good start, but ideally we want to find out
which thread currently owns each mutex. How can we manage that?
</p><p>
Going back to the uClibc sources, we can see that __lll_lock_wait()
is called from pthread_mutex_lock(). The integer pointer provided to
__lll_lock_wait() is actually a pointer to the pthread_mutex_t structure:

<pre     class="programlisting">
typedef union
{
  struct __pthread_mutex_s
  {
    int __lock;
    unsigned int __count;
    int __owner;
    int __kind;
    unsigned int __nusers;
    __extension__ union
    {
      int __spins;
      __pthread_slist_t __list;
    };
  } __data;
  char __size[__SIZEOF_PTHREAD_MUTEX_T];
  long int __align;
} pthread_mutex_t;
</pre>
</p><p>
The __owner field looks interesting, and on further investigation it
seems that __owner is set to the thread ID (TID) of the thread that is
currently holding the mutex.
</p><p>
By combining these two pieces of information (namely the mutex pointer
provided to __lll_lock_wait(); and the __owner field two integers on in
that structure), we should be able to find out which threads are blocking
on which mutexes.
</p><p>
The trouble is that this would be very tedious to iterate through by
hand. Each thread that is blocking in __lll_lock_wait() will need to
be selected. Then the contents of register a0 must be queried for the
appropriate stack frame of each thread, and the memory at the location
pointed to by a0 examined to discover which thread owns the mutex that
the thread is waiting for. Even for this trivial program, we have some
32 threads to look at, which is a lot of manual work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1655580.0x174e958"></a>
Putting Python into Practice</h2></div></div><p>
Rather than driving the debugger by hand, let's instead look at how we
can automate the task described above using the GDB Python API. First, we need to be able to iterate over each thread in the process
under debugging (the &ldquo;inferior&rdquo;, in GDB terminology). To do
this, we can
use the threads() method of the gdb.Inferior class:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for process in gdb.inferiors():
    for thread in process.threads():
        print thread
</pre>
</p><p>
That was easy. Now we need to look at the currently executing stack frame
for each thread and figure out whether it is waiting on a mutex. We can
do this using the gdb module function selected_frame() and the name()
method of the gdb.Frame class:


<pre     class="programlisting">
for process in gdb.inferiors():
    for thread in process.threads():
        thread.switch()
        frame = gdb.selected_frame()
        if frame.name() == "__lll_lock_wait":
            print "Thread is blocking in __lll_lock_wait"
</pre>
</p><p>
So far, so good. Now that we have a method for programmatically finding
each thread that is waiting on a mutex, we need to examine the contents
of the a0 register for each of those threads. This should extract a
pointer to the mutex structure that the thread is waiting on. Happily,
GDB provides a convenience variable, $a0, which we can use to access
the a0 register. The gdb module function parse_and_eval() provides API
access to convenience variables, amongst other things:


<pre     class="programlisting">
for process in gdb.inferiors():
    for thread in process.threads():
        thread.switch()
        frame = gdb.selected_frame()
        if frame.name() == "__lll_lock_wait":
            print "Thread is blocking in __lll_lock_wait"
            a0 = gdb.parse_and_eval("$a0")
</pre>
</p><p>
The last piece of information we need to extract from GDB is the contents
of memory at the pointer in the a0 register so that we can determine the
__owner field for each mutex in play. Although it's probably cheating
to do so, we can fall back on the gdb module function execute() to pass
the <tt  >x</tt> command to the GDB command-line interface. This will print the
contents of memory to a string that we can parse to find the required
information:


<pre     class="programlisting">
for process in gdb.inferiors():
    for thread in process.threads():
        thread.switch()
        frame = gdb.selected_frame()
        if frame.name() == "__lll_lock_wait":
            print "Thread is blocking in __lll_lock_wait"
            a0 = gdb.parse_and_eval("$a0")
            s = gdb.execute("x/4d $a0", to_string=True).split()
            s.reverse()
            owner = int(s[1])
</pre>
</p><p>
It's not particularly pretty to look at, but it works. This code splits
the string returned from the <tt  >x</tt> command into a whitespace-delimited
list. Because GDB may alter the labels used at the start of the output
depending on what symbolic information it can extract from the application
binary, we then reverse the list and pull out the second-to-last
value. This yields the third integer value in the structure, which in
this case is the __owner field of pthread_mutex_t.
</p><p>
All that remains to do now is to plug all of these pieces of data together
to provide some useful information. Listing 2 shows the full Python code
to do this. Putting it all together:

The deadlock now becomes very clear. Thread 740 is waiting for a mutex
currently owned by thread 768, and thread 768 in turn is waiting for the
mutex that thread 740 currently owns. Neither thread can run until the
mutex owned by the other becomes available. Returning to the GDB prompt,

As the backtraces show, the two threads have followed two different
code paths to end up in the deadlock situation. Reviewing the code for
hello_world in light of this information should allow us to find the bug:
bad_printer() is taking the print and statistics locks in the wrong order.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Adding a Python API to GDB provides another capable weapon in the Linux
debugging arsenal. For embedded systems, where other debugging tools
may not be so widely available, a powerful programmatic interface to
GDB can make the difference between hours of painstaking debugging and
minutes of enjoyable scripting.
</p><p>
Astute readers will have noted that the bug we have discovered in this
article is not the only bug in hello_world.c. The task of finding and
fixing the remaining bugs is left as an exercise for readers to tackle
with their new-found GDB Python knowledge. Have fun!

The MIPS architecture has 32 general-purpose integer registers. Of these,
the hardware
architecture specifies that registers 0 and 31 are used for the value zero
and the function
return address, respectively. The usage of the rest of the registers is
entirely defined by the
software toolchain.
</p><p>
By convention, however, the use of the general-purpose MIPS registers is
quite firmly set
to allow software interoperability. For example, registers 4 to 7 are used
to pass the
first four non-floating-point arguments to functions and are given the
names a0 to a3.
