Tor Browser Bundle&mdash;Tor Goes Portable
(<a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en" target="_self">https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
I've never covered a subproject of something I've reviewed before,
but I noticed this a few weeks ago when trawling the Tor site
(I've no idea how I missed it until now). It seemed so important that
I instantly gave it top billing for this month's column.
</p><p>
Tor has become increasingly famous/infamous in the past few months due
to its use by Web sites like WikiLeaks, as well as its crucial
role in getting information out to the world during the recent Egyptian
revolution.
</p><p>
For those unfamiliar with Tor, <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> has covered it
before&mdash;see Kyle Rankin's article &ldquo;Browse the Web
without a Trace&rdquo; in the January 2008 issue
and my New Projects column in the April 2010 issue.
But to recap, the Tor Web site sums it up nicely:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The Tor software protects you by bouncing your communications around a
distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world:
it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning
what sites you visit, it prevents the sites you visit from learning
your physical location, and it lets you access sites that are blocked.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
However, in standard form, Tor is a rather cumbersome beast, with
all sorts of background process d&aelig;mons, complex configuration files,
startup services and so on. Even if you're a pretty advanced user,
there's still a good chance of something going wrong somewhere, delaying
your chance to jump on-line securely.
This is where the Tor Browser Bundle comes to the rescue:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The Tor Browser Bundle lets you use Tor on Windows, Mac OS X or Linux
without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB Flash drive,
comes with a pre-configured Web browser and is self-contained. The
Tor IM Browser Bundle additionally allows instant messaging and chat
over Tor. 
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Before I continue, the Web site offers a caveat that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> readers 
probably will find more important than most:
&ldquo;Note that the Firefox in our bundles is modified from the default
Firefox; we're currently working with Mozilla to see if they want us to
change the name to make this clearer&rdquo;.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11036f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Extending your options greatly, the Vidalia Control Panel is a great
tool when using Tor.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11036f2.large.jpg"><img src="11036f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
If you get this message in big green letters, Tor's running
fine!
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11036f3.large.jpg"><img src="11036f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The default no-script settings can send some Web sites haywire!
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Although the bundle was designed to run on a Flash drive, that needn't
be the case. Like many others, I simply saved this to hard drive and
ran it from there. Feel free to do the same if you're so inclined.
</p><p>
As for installing the bundle (well, sort of), the Tor people were good
enough to offer the following instructions, saving me a lot of trouble:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Download the architecture-appropriate file above, save it somewhere, then
run: <tt  >tar -xvzf
tor-browser-gnu-linux--dev-LANG.tar.gz</tt> (where LANG is the
language listed in the filename), and either double-click on the directory
or <tt  >cd</tt> into it, then execute the start-tor-browser
script. This launches
Vidalia, and once that connects to Tor, it launches Firefox.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Before continuing, this bundle is designed to run on machines that don't have
Tor installed. If you do have Tor installed and running, stop the process
and then you can carry on.
</p><p>
Now, with the Browser Bundle running, first the Vidalia control panel
will start, which is designed to establish a Tor connection as well as
manage various Tor options using a GUI front end. I recommend exploring
the Vidalia control panel, as it has neat features, such as bandwidth
monitoring, network viewer, settings dialog and more.
</p><p>
Provided all has gone well, Firefox should start and will try to load
a Web page. This Web page takes a while to load&mdash;don't worry; the Tor
network is pretty slow at the best of times, and if everything worked,
you'll soon have a message that says in big green letters:
&ldquo;Congratulations. Your browser is configured to use Tor.&rdquo;
</p><p>
From here, you can browse like you would any other day, but the
uninitiated may be in for a shock. Most modern Web sites have fancy
scripts and Flash objects, and these very features are what causes the
greatest security holes. Hence, Tor's browser disables these scripts 
by default. Chances are that the only Web sites that will work without
hassle are deliberately minimalist in their design.
</p><p>
However, don't worry. If you look at the screen's bottom right,
you'll see an icon with a blue S. Click on that icon, and you can choose
either to enable scripts for this particular Web site or enable scripts
globally (not recommended for the security reasons just mentioned).
</p><p>
Those willing to take the risk can choose new default
settings for security in the preferences, available under Edit&rarr;Preferences. Given the nature of this project, the default settings
are understandably set for paranoia. If you're undertaking work that
involves a serious security risk, be <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> careful with what you
enable or disable. If you're unsure of the risk you're
taking, perhaps a more secure, minimalist and less-script-reliant
Web service would be a better choice for your activities (assuming an
alternative is available, of course).
</p><p>
Something I couldn't get working under the Linux version was Flash in
general. My older brother said he used Tor to watch some overseas TV shows
not available in Australia and inaccessible to those with IP addresses
external to a certain country. He was using the Windows version of Tor,
and I'm guessing that he would've used the Browser Bundle, instead of
setting up a machine with Tor permanently installed. The content he was
viewing was Flash-based, so he must have been able to enable it for such
a session.
</p><p>
I realize that Flash presents a security risk, but many people will
want to use the Tor Browser Bundle for something as trivial as watching
international TV shows&mdash;not really the sort of thing that will have
the authorities kicking down your front door. If any readers out there
know how to get Flash running with the Linux bundle, feel free to drop
me an e-mail. I'd love to hear from you!
</p><p>
Moving back onto more serious topics, in journalism in particular, projects
such as Tor will become increasingly indispensable in moving information
beyond borders and protecting user privacy against prying eyes. When
I last tried Tor, it gave me a headache and was far from intuitive in
its use. However, a clever little bundle such as this gives Tor's power
of anonymity to those with average PC skills, and regardless of its use,
that's an important thing.

NUT&mdash;Nutrition Software
(<a href="http://nut.sourceforge.net" target="_self">nut.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
If you're watching your weight, monitoring your health and dietary habits,
or simply unconvinced by flashy food labels that don't tell the whole
story, this is the project for you.
According to the Web site:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I have written open-source free nutrition software, NUT, which
records what you eat and analyzes your meals for nutrient levels in
terms of the &ldquo;Daily Value&rdquo;, or DV, which is the standard for food labeling
in the US. The program uses the free food composition database from
the USDA. This free nutritional analysis software was written for UNIX
systems (I use Linux), but it can be compiled on just about any system with
a C compiler. (To get a free C compiler, Windows people might look at
Cygwin or MinGW, and Mac people might look at xcode.) By experimenting
with NUT, you can find the optimal level of the various nutrients and how
to implement this with foods available to you. NUT can help reconstruct
the lost instruction manual to your care and feeding, because, when
the authorities and crackpots disagree on the proper human diet, you
can design an experiment using the food composition tables to discover
the truth!
</p></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11036f4.large.jpg"><img src="11036f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
NUT has an extensive database of food statistics, worth the price of
admission alone (console version pictured).
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11036f5.large.jpg"><img src="11036f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The NUT GUI makes using this program much less tiresome and displays
other forms of information simultaneously. Here's the stats for bearded
seal oil.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11036f6.large.jpg"><img src="11036f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
One of the main reasons for using NUT is recording your daily meals
and then running detailed analysis against them.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
I'm unsure of other distributions, but binaries are available for Debian
and Ubuntu. I run with the usual source option here.
Grab the latest source tarball, extract it, and open a terminal in the
new folder.
At the time of this writing, NUT didn't have an install script, so you'll
need to do a number
of steps manually. Assuming the /usr/local folders
are fine for installation, issue the following commands as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir /usr/local/lib/nut/
# mv raw.data/* /usr/local/lib/nut/
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distro uses sudo (such as Ubuntu), simply prefix those commands
with the sudo command.
</p><p>
Once this step is out of the way, compile the program with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
If the compiling goes well, you should be able to use the console
program immediately. Simply enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./nut
</pre>
</p><p>
This runs the console program, which I look at in the next
session. As for the GUI program, that needs to be compiled separately.
</p><p>
Change into the flkt directory by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd fltk
</pre>
</p><p>
And again, enter the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ make
</pre>
</p><p>
I ran into compilation problems when I first tried to compile the
fltk component (hence, yesterday I was going to cover only the console
program). I'm not sure what I did to get it working,
but I think it was downloading fltk 1.3 manually from the fltk Web site,
then compiling and installing it separately.
If you manage to get it compiled, you can run the GUI program now
by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./Nut
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10f9580.0x15eb440"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Note the capital letter above&mdash;it's the differentiator between the GUI and
command-line programs.
</p><p>
If you'd like quick access to NUT, copy the executables
into bin folders. If you're still in the fltk directory, change back
into the main directory of the nut folder:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd ..
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, enter these commands as either root or sudo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mv nut /usr/local/bin/
# mv nut.1 /usr/local/man/man1/
# mv fltk/Nut /usr/local/bin
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you either can run the command-line version with
<tt  >nut</tt> or the
GUI with <tt  >Nut</tt>.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the long installation instructions haven't left me much room to cover
the actual usage of NUT, but thankfully, things are pretty simple to use.
</p><p>
The console version uses a series of number-driven menus to navigate
between functions and foods. For instance, option 1 is for recording
meals, followed immediately by a prompt for the date, the meal number
and, finally, the name of the food.
</p><p>
Entering the name of the food needn't be precise, as NUT's main strength
is its database. Long lists of premade choices exist, and each choice
has detailed information regarding a food's nutritional value, such as
protein, carbohydrates, specific vitamins and so on.
</p><p>
Head back into the main menu, and more options exist, such as an analysis
of your meals and food suggestions, trend plotting and so on, but most
people will want to look at options 4 and 6. Here you can browse the
extensive database, comparing nutritional values of all sorts of food
and drink to your heart's content.
The entries are extensive&mdash;everything from Red Bull to bearded
seal meat.
</p><p>
As for the GUI, I'm not 100% sure, but it appears to have more options
than the console version, such as reset controls and the ability to
control various ratios. Perhaps I missed them in the console version, but
either way, there's definitely more on the screen, more of the time. Plus,
everything is broken down into tabs, making the whole process more
intuitive, saving the user from navigating endless submenus.
</p><p>
All in all, this is a very clever program despite the currently long-winded
installation process. Once those issues are ironed out, NUT will be a
seriously nifty nutrition program.
