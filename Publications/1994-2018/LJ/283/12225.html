Cheap Android Device for Testing Apps</h4><p>
Some time ago Shawn Powers mentioned having found some device that replaced the
Galaxy Player 4. I haven't found the article (again) yet, but I would
like to find a cheap Android device to use in playing with Android apps.
Can you give me a pointer to the issue where you discussed that, or a
pointer to what is on the market that might work?

<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> The article was in issue 251, March 2015. I haven't looked at it in
a while, and although conceptually, I'm sure it's still valid, the phones
listed are way outdated. I'm currently using a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact,
which is also a bit outdated, but it still works fast enough for playing
audio and such. I actually had Cricket Wireless service on the phone for
a few months, but I let that expire and just use it with Wi-Fi now. I'm
extremely happy with the device after rooting it. I went with the Z5
because it was small, but if size isn't an issue, any Android phone
from a generation or two back would be more than adequate for such
things. Just do research in advance to make sure it's easy to root,
because that is essential for most nerdy endeavors!

BYOC Part III, Replacing btools with ClusterShell</h4><p>
In the very interesting articles about building your own cluster (see the
&ldquo;BYOC&rdquo; series by Nathan R. Vance, Michael L. Poublon and
William F. Polik in the May, June and July 2017 issues), the authors
described
writing some tools to reach all nodes from the cluster, the Btools
scripts. I would suggest giving a try to ClusterShell, which is
a Python tool and library to connect, through ssh, a big set of nodes
in parallel. It also provides remote copy and so on:

<pre     class="programlisting">

bexec &lt;command&gt; -&gt; clush -a &lt;command&gt;
bpush &lt;file&gt; &lt;destfile&gt;-&gt; clush -a --copy &lt;file&gt; [--dest &lt;destfile&gt;]

</pre>
</p><p>
See <a href="http://cea-hpc.github.io/clustershell" target="_self">cea-hpc.github.io/clustershell</a>.

<span   class="bold"><b>Nathan Vance, Michael Poublon and William Polik
reply:</b></span> Thanks for your interest in cluster
computing. There are excellent packages for administering nodes on a
production cluster, such as ClusterShell (clush) or Cluster Command
&amp; Control (C3). The purpose of btools is to demonstrate a minimal,
self-contained set of tools for cluster management. Any Linux users can
then understand what is happening under the hood when they &ldquo;Build Your
Own Cluster (BYOC)&rdquo;!

A General Request</h4><p>
I wrote about Linux in the past (a long time ago). I would just strongly
encourage the Linux community to try to debug old problems rather than
make new software and jump on new distributions. It has been
an observation of mine that although Linux does work on almost anything,
the turnover is too fast for most humans to keep up with.

</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> I understand and largely agree with your sentiment. As someone
who has &ldquo;re-invented the wheel&rdquo; a few times, however, I can attest
that sometimes figuring out someone else's work takes more time than
starting from scratch. That's not necessarily the fault of the original
developer. As busy geeks, we tend to take the avenue of least resistance,
and unfortunately, that often means leaving a trail of destruction and
abandonment in our wake. Yours is a good reminder though that open
source was built on the shoulders of those who came before. If we can
build on the success of someone else, it will make an even better product
in the end.

and he has at least
mentioned them from time to time in articles (search for

Comments on Charles Fisher's inotify Article</h4><p>
Having needed to solve a similar problem in the past, I was very
interested to read Charles Fisher's article (&ldquo;Linux Filesystem Events with
inotify&rdquo;) in the August 2017 issue. However, I noticed one problem with
it that needs clarification. Twice in the text he states that inotify
can't monitor remote, network-mounted filesystems, such as NFS. This is
not entirely true. inotify can report on filesystem changes on an
NFS-mounted filesystem, but only for the file activity on the system
on which those changes are being made, just like a local filesystem.
It will not report on remotely generated events (for example, a file being
manipulated on the NFS share by another server).

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Todd
 Campbell  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Charles Fisher responds:</b></span> Assuming that the remote NFS server is running
Linux, this seems reasonable (although I have not tested it). There have
been several Linux NFS implementations, starting with the user-space
server in the 1990s and proceeding through all the protocol versions as
they were introduced and implemented in the kernel. I'd be confident
that inotify would function properly in most of them, but not certain.
</p><p>
Obviously, any other file sharing protocol will have even bigger problems
(for example, SMB), and if the remote server is not Linux, inotify is not a
workable tool. I might also point out that one of my mentions of this was a
direct quote from a systemd manual page, and it might be a hard sell to get
that changed.

Banana Backup Article</h4><p>
I much enjoyed Kyle Rankin's &ldquo;Banana Backups&rdquo; article on using Banana Pi and a 2.5" drive for
backups in the September 2017 issue. It's a really good idea. Another suggestion for the software
is storeBackup. I have been using it on both my personal Bodhi Linux
laptop where I do my daily work as well as on the little home server I
run on an old Toshiba Satellite laptop.
</p><p>
The little server runs ownCloud, SubSonic, caliber-server, MySQL and a
few other smaller services. ownCloud has a fair amount of data, including
all my contacts, calendar, legal documents photos and music. So it's a lot
of stuff that I don't want to lose.
</p><p>
storeBackup is a Perl application that is very simple to set up with a
single configuration file, great documentation (downloadable or online),
and it's simple to install. It has been a rock-solid performer for me. It
uses hard links and compression to reduce disk storage size.
</p><p>
I won't say it is better than any other backup software, but if one likes
Linux and Perl and open source, it is a solid solution in my experience
and worth mentioning.
</p><p>
Thanks for an excellent article in an always excellent magazine!

It's Time for a Linux Live CD That Works for Netflix</h4><p>
I just spent the past month watching Amazon Prime Video using a Linux
Mint 18.1 Live CD (no HDD exposed to the internet).
</p><p>
I only had to install npapi to get around the DRM requirement. This setup
worked for three of the four weeks during the one-month free trial, but then it
stopped working for some unknown reason.
</p><p>
Perhaps, it's time for a Linux version of its Live CD that is
specifically configured to work for Netflix or Amazon Prime Video without
any configuration&mdash;it would be very helpful to us users.
</p><p>
Is there an article here for discussion?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Stephen
   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> DRM is the bane of
our open-source hearts, isn't it? I get so frustrated
trying to make such things work on my system, that I have resorted
to using apps and/or devices like Roku in order to watch streaming
media. Well, honestly, I usually use Plex to stream media, but that
requires an entire DVR system, which sort of takes away the whole point
of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Video and so on. I don't have a great answer, other
than perhaps resort to a tablet with an Android app, as those are almost
always going to be updated and will work well. I wish I was more help!

Linux Live CD with VPN Included</h4><p>
Greetings, I surf the internet with a Mint CD without using a hard drive.
I now require the use of a VPN.
</p><p>
What are my options? (Also there doesn't appear to be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> company selling
a VPN for this scenario.)
</p><p>
When the above was posted on a Mint help chat session, these were the
responses:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Time to learn &ldquo;iso&rdquo; making.
</p></li><li><p>
Mint suggests a VPN service on its web page.
</p></li><li><p>
Persistence install may help.
</p></li><li><p>
In principle, it is possible to create/modify the cd image to include
this, but it takes some effort; alternatively, you can create a USB Flash
drive version with some persistent memory and install OpenVPN on that.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Now, I didn't really want to use a different Linux distribution just to
get the included VPN application.
</p><p>
Also, my concern with using a USB Flash drive is that it could be easily
hacked,
since it is not read-only, correct?
</p><p>
Anyway, this could make for a good article, right?
</p><p>
I look forward to hearing back from you with some good insight on a solution
to my dilemma!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Stephen
   <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> Stephen, like your Netflix question, I don't have a perfect answer.
Rather than a live CD or a USB drive, perhaps
a distribution like Qubes would work for you? I realize that's switching
distributions, which you wanted to avoid, but if security is a concern,
it might be worth considering. Apart from that, I think the USB drive
with persistence is the best option.

Firewall Help?</h4><p>
I am looking for a gigabit firewall to put between my ISP provider's modem
and my internal network. Although the ISP modem contains a firewall, it
is not so secure as others or as a custom firewall.
</p><p>
Maybe a project for later with these goals:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Maintaining the throughput of 1 gigabit.
</p></li><li><p>
Allowing video signals from IP cameras to pass.
</p></li><li><p>
Dynamically blocking intrusion on different ports.
</p></li><li><p>
Blocking defective UDP and TCP packets, and IPs from outside with inside
IPs.
</p></li><li><p>
Blocking traffic if not generated from inside network.
</p></li><li><p>
Allowing VPN network and server.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I was looking for commercial firewalls with a reasonable price, but I
found only licensed firewalls that did not fulfill my expectations for
a private firewall at home.

<span   class="bold"><b>Shawn Powers replies:</b></span> Although certainly possible with Linux, I have to admit for instances like
this, I usually go to pfSense. It's BSD-based, but it has a very powerful
interface and an even more powerful system beneath. It's open source
and free to install anywhere. The company does sell hardware through a partner,
but the firewall can be installed on any system. If you do something on
your own, maybe pitch the idea to us at info@linuxjournal.com;
perhaps your experience will make a good article!
