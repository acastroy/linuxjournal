Identity is personal. You need to start there.
</p><p>
In the natural world where we live and breathe, personal identity can get
complicated, but it's not broken. If an Inuit family from Qikiqtaaluk wants to
name their kid Anuun or Issorartuyok, they do, and the world copes. If the same
kid later wants to call himself Steve, he does. Again, the world copes. So does
Steve.
</p><p>
Much of that coping is done by Steve <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> identifying himself unless he needs to,
and then by not revealing more than what's required. In most cases Steve isn't
accessing a service, but merely engaging with other people, and in ways so
casual that in most cases no harm is done if the other person forgets Steve's
name or how he introduced himself. In fact, most of what happens in the social
realms of the natural world are free of identifiers, and that's a feature
rather than a bug. Dunbar's number
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number</a>) exists for a reason. So does the fact
that human memory is better at forgetting details than at remembering them. This
too is a feature. Most of what we know is tacit rather than explicit. As the
scientist and philosopher Michael Polanyi
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Polanyi" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Polanyi</a>) puts it (in perhaps his only quotable
line), &ldquo;We know more than we can tell.&rdquo; This is why we can easily recognize a
person without being able to describe exactly how we do that, and without
knowing his or her name or other specific &ldquo;identifying&rdquo; details about them.
</p><p>
Steve's identity can also be a claim that does not require proof, or even need
to be accurate. For example, he may tell the barista at a coffee shop that his
name is Clive to avoid confusion with the guy ahead of him who just said
<span   class="emphasis"><em>his</em></span>
name is Steve.
</p><p>
How we create and cope with identity in the natural world has lately come to be
called <span   class="emphasis"><em>self-sovereign</em></span>, at least among digital identity obsessives such as
myself. Self-sovereign identity starts by recognizing that the kind of naming we
get from our parents, tribes and selves is at the root level of how identity
works in the natural world, and needs to frame our approaches in the digital one
as well.
</p><p>
Our main problem with identity in the digital world is that we understand it
entirely in terms of organizations and their needs. These approaches are
administrative rather than personal or social. They work for the convenience of
organizations first. In administrative systems, identities are just records,
usually kept in databases. Aside from your business card, every name imprinted
on a rectangle in your wallet was issued to you by some administrative system:
the government, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the school, the drug store
chain. None are your identity. All are identifiers used by organizations to keep
track of you.
</p><p>
For your inconvenience, every organization's identity system is also a separate
and proprietary silo, even if it is built with open-source software and
methods.
Worse, an organization might have many different silo'd identity systems that
know little or nothing about each other. Even an organization as unitary as a
university might have completely different identity systems operating within HR,
health care, parking, laundry, sports and IT&mdash;as well as within its
scholastic realm, which also might have any number of different departmental
administrative systems, each with its own record of students past and present.
</p><p>
While ways of &ldquo;federating&rdquo; identities between silos have been around since the
last millennium, there is still no standard or open-source way for you to
change, say, your surname or your mailing address with all the administrative
systems you deal with, in one move. In fact, doing so is unthinkable as long as
our understanding of identity remains framed inside the norms of silo'd
administrative systems and thinking.
</p><p>
Administrative systems have been built into civilized life for as long as we've
had governments, companies and churches, to name just three institutions. But
every problem we ever had with any of those only got worse once we had ways to
digitize what was wrong with them, and then to network the same problems. This
is why our own ability to administrate the many different ways we are known to
the world's identity systems only gets worse every time we click
&ldquo;accept&rdquo; to some site's, service's or app's terms and
conditions, and create yet another login, password and namespace to manage.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the internet was first provisioned to the mass market over dial-up
lines, and both ISPs and website developers made client-server the defaulted way
to deal with people. By design, client-server is slave-master, because it puts
nearly all power on the server side. The client has no more agency or identity
than the server allows it.
</p><p>
True, a website works (or ought to work) by answering client requests for files.
But we see how much respect that gets by looking at the history of Do Not Track
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track" target="_self">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track</a>).
Originally meant as a polite request by clients for servers to respect personal
privacy, it was opposed so aggressively by the world's advertisers and
commercial publishers that people took matters into their own hands by
installing browser extensions for blocking ads and tracking. Then the W3C itself
got corrupted by commercial interests, morphing Do Not Track into &ldquo;tracking
preference expressions&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection" target="_self">www.w3.org/2011/tracking-protection</a>). If individuals had full agency on the web in the first
place, this never would have happened. But they didn't, and it did.
</p><p>
So we won't solve forever-standing identity problems with client-server, any
more than we would have solved the need for personal computing with more
generous mainframes.
</p><p>
If we want fully human digital identity to work on the internet, we have to
respect the deeply human need for self-determination. That requires means for
individuals to assert self-sovereign identities, and for systems to require only
verified claims when they need useful identity information. Anything else will
be repeating mistakes of the past.
</p><p>
It should help to remember that most human interaction is not with big
administrative systems. For example, around 99% of the world's businesses are
small. (See &ldquo;Small is the New Big&rdquo;:
<a href="https://shift.newco.co/small-is-the-new-big-5e7f2c715fa1" target="_self">https://shift.newco.co/small-is-the-new-big-5e7f2c715fa1</a>.) Even if every business of every size becomes
digital and connected, they need to be able to operate without requiring outside
(such as government or platform) administrative systems, for the simple reason that
most of the ways people identify each other in the offline world is both
minimally and on a need-to-know basis. It is only inside administrative systems
that fixed identities and identifiers are required. And even they only really
need to deal with verified claims.
</p><p>
So we need to recognize three things, in this order:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
That everybody comes to the networked world with sovereign-source identities of
their own, that they need to be able to make verifiable claims for various
identity-related purposes; but that they don't need to do either at all
times and in all circumstances.
</p></li><li><p>
That the world is still full of administrative systems, and that those systems
can come into alignment once they recognize the self-sovereign nature of human
beings. That means seeing human beings as fully human and not just as
&ldquo;consumers&rdquo; or &ldquo;users&rdquo; of products and services provided by organizations. And
it means coming up, at last, with standard and trusted ways individual human
beings can alter identity information with many different administrative
systems, using standards-based tools of their own.
</p></li><li><p>
There are billions (the World Bank says 2.5:
<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/ict/brief/the-identity-target-in-the-post-2015-development-agenda-connections-note-19" target="_self">www.worldbank.org/en/topic/ict/brief/the-identity-target-in-the-post-2015-development-agenda-connections-note-19</a>) of people in the world who lack any
&ldquo;official identification&rdquo;. Thus &ldquo;official ID for all&rdquo; is a goal of the United
Nations, the World Bank and other large organizations trying to help masses of
people who will be coming online during the next few years, especially refugees.
Some of these people have good reasons not to be known, while others have good
reasons to be known. It's complicated. Still, the commitment is there. The UN's
Sustainable Development Goal 16.9 says &ldquo;By 2030, provide legal identity for all,
including birth registration&rdquo; (<a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16" target="_self">https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16</a>).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
What we need for all of these is an open-source and distributed approach that's
NEA: Nobody owns it, Everybody can use it and Anybody can improve it. Within
that scope, much is possible.
</p><p>
In &ldquo;Rebooting the Web of Trust&rdquo;
(<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md" target="_self">https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md</a>), 
Joe Andrieu says <span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;Identity is how we keep track of
people and things and, in turn, how they keep track of us.&rdquo;</em></span> Among many other
helpful things in that piece, Joe says this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Engineers, entrepreneurs, and financiers have asked &ldquo;Why are we spending so
much time with a definition of identity? Why not just build something and fix it
if it is broken?&rdquo; The vital, simple reason is <span   class="bold"><b>human
dignity</b></span>.
</p><p>
When we build interconnected systems without a core understanding of identity,
we risk <span   class="bold"><b>inadvertently</b></span> compromising human
dignity. We risk <span   class="bold"><b>accidentally</b></span> building
systems that deny self-expression, place individuals in harm's way, and
unintentionally oppress those most in need of self-determination.
</p><p>
There are times when the needs of <span   class="bold"><b>security</b></span> outweigh the need for human dignity.
Fine. It's the job of our <span   class="bold"><b>political</b></span>
systems&mdash;local, national, and
international&mdash;to minimize abuse and to establish boundaries and practices
that respect basic human rights.
</p><p>
But when engineers <span   class="bold"><b>unwittingly</b></span> compromise the ability of individuals to
self-express their identity, when we expose personal information in unexpected
ways, when our systems deny basic services because of a flawed understanding of
identity, these are <span   class="bold"><b>avoidable tragedies</b></span>. What might seem a minor technicality in
one conversation could lead to the loss of privacy, liberty, or even life for an
individual whose identity is <span   class="bold"><b>unintentionally
compromised</b></span>.
</p><p>
That's why it pays to understand identity, so the systems we build
intentionally enable human dignity instead of accidentally destroy it.

Phil Windley (<a href="http://www.windley.com" target="_self">www.windley.com</a>), whom I have sourced often in these
columns (see &ldquo;Doing for User Space What We Did for Kernel Space&rdquo;:
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/doing-user-space-what-we-did-kernel-space" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/doing-user-space-what-we-did-kernel-space</a>
and
&ldquo;The Actually Distributed Web&rdquo;:
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/actually-distributed-web" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/content/actually-distributed-web</a>, for example), has lately turned optimistic about developing decentralized
identity approaches
(<a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2017/08/the_case_for_decentralized_identity.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2017/08/the_case_for_decentralized_identity.shtml</a>). 
His own work chairing the Sovrin Foundation (<a href="https://sovrin.org" target="_self">https://sovrin.org</a>)
is toward what he calls &ldquo;a global utility for identity&rdquo; based on a distributed
ledger such as blockchain. And, of course, open source. He writes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
A universal
<span   class="emphasis"><em>decentralized</em></span> identity platform offers the opportunity for services to be
decentralized...I don't have to be a sharecropper for some large corporation. As
an example, I can imagine a universal, decentralized identity system giving rise
to apps that let anyone share rides in their car without the overhead of a Lyft
or Uber because the identity system would let others vouch for the driver and
the passenger.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
That vouching is done by a verified claim. Not by calling on some centralized
&ldquo;identity provider&rdquo;.

Phil, Kaliya (Identity Woman: <a href="https://identitywoman.net" target="_self">https://identitywoman.net</a>) and I put on the
Internet Identity Workshop (<a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com" target="_self">www.internetidentityworkshop.com</a>) twice
a year at the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley. We had our 25th just
last month. All three of our obsessions with identity go back to the last
millennium. At no time since then have I felt more optimistic than I do now
about the possibility that we might finally solve this thing. But we'll need
help. I invite everyone here who wants to get in on a good thing soon to weigh
in and help out.
