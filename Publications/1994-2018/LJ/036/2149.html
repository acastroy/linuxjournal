me with the global perspective of the Linux world which cannot be
easily obtained by searching the Web, Usenet, and the like. I am
always grateful for your efforts and hope <i  >LJ</i>

<i  >Linux Journal</i>. I eagerly wait for it to arrive
at my door each month. I have been using Linux for a few years now
and currently develope applications and utilities for Linux using
Motif and, more recently, Java.</p><p>The concern I have for Linux is the ever-growing use of Java
as a programming language of choice. I am not saying using Java to
deploy applications on Linux is a bad thing, and I am not putting
down the Java programming language (I use it regularly, and enjoy
it). It just takes away some of the developer support for
Linux-specific applications, which Linux needs. If applications are
written in Java and run on Linux or any other operating system for
that matter are we just turning our beloved operating systems into
another Sun JavaStation or Oracle NC? Running Java-based
applications on Linux is fine, but is Linux then losing the free
and commercial application base that it needs to bring Linux to the
next step? The next step being broad-based commercial Linux
applications, that could be purchased at your local computer store
or out of a general PC magazine. As many of us know, having a high
number of applications available for an operating system attracts
more people to it.</p><p>On the other hand, Linux has been a Java trail-blazer. Linux
can incorporate Java binary support into its kernel. Creating
applications in Java has its upside&mdash;applications which have been
developed on a Microsoft platform can be easily run on the Linux
operating system. Because of this, Linux could become a major
platform in small- and medium-sized businesses that need both a
rock solid operating system to run their operation and to be able
to run all of the big name brand software. The Java language could
actually increase the Linux-installed base around the world. If
users of other operating systems become tired of software upgrade
costs, downloading bug fixes and paying huge per minute costs to
telephone support companies, maybe Linux will become the logical
decision. Stover Babcock stover@pit-stop.com</p><p>The history of personal computers seems to have many examples
of systems clutched too tightly by their creators, missing out on
opportunities to broaden appeal and usage. Making Linux
Java-capable does not change the essential nature of Linux: free
and open.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x252a580.0x2622500"></a>Multithreaded Programming Library</h2></div></div><p>In my article on multithreaded programming [&ldquo;What is
Multi-Threading?&rdquo;, Issue 34], I completely failed to mention where
to obtain the library I make use of in the programs that go with
the article. The library I use came from
http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads and is very good, and
less than 100K to download. Cheers, Martin

refreshing to know that there is a journal dedicated to
Linux.</p><p>I live and play in Biloxi, Mississippi, an area not often
thought of in positive, humanistic ways. But time and imported
people have brought this area from gloom to glimmer. Technology has
finally arrived in the deep south, sparked from casual
conversations on a campus computer system, to a full blown ISP
using Linux, of course. My Linux box is connected to the Internet
via their service. Okay, so we have technology here, and we have
people to utilize it. I know there is a small and quiet group of
people out there who use Linux also. The gist of this letter is I
would like to form a Linux users' group here, so the quiet group
can join together and spread the wealth of knowledge out there with
each other. For only by becoming a community of friends and
associates, can we continue to grow and nurture our Love for
Linux.Thank You Ted F. Fox tfox@gooner.datasync.com</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>This is a good opportunity to mention GLUE&mdash;Groups

the Editor in the February 1997 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> about not finding Linux distributions in
stores.</p><p>I have been able to find Slackware and Red Hat in the major
software stores in Houston for some time now, and I can even go
into a few major book stores and not only find lots of books on
Linux with their bundled distributions, but I have even found Red
Hat 4.0 and Applixware on the shelf! I guess Linux has caught on
earlier in some parts of the country than others. (At the first
ever Houston Linux Users Group organizational meeting, we had over
150 people show up!) Don Harper Pencom Systems
