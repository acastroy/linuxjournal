    When you need to debug binary code, use a dump provided by a
    nifty
    command called od.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1be8580.0x1ce0450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Suppose you are writing the next great
spreadsheet for Linux, and you're actually getting along pretty
well. You have a program that can edit cells, format the screen,
and do all the really good spreadsheet stuff. And you can even save
the sheets in a user-specified file. But then you make a change to
the format of the file, and you realize you need to examine the
file, byte by byte, in order to determine what went wrong with that
last change. You know that Emacs can show you the file, but you
can't remember exactly how to get into hexadecimal mode, or what to
do once you are there.
</p><p>Or suppose you are writing a viewer program for your favorite
word-processor, which runs only under your second favorite
operating system (WINE and DOSEMU notwithstanding). So you need to
figure out exactly what each binary code in that .wpd file really
is, so that you can determine what each binary code does by trial
and error. (What a trial and error process
<span   class="bold"><b>that</b></span> would be.)</p><p>Or maybe you are curious about exactly what escape sequence
is sent to your terminal when a curses program positions the
cursor. (Maybe this example is a bit contrived, but it's
interesting nonetheless.)</p><p>If any of these scenarios describes your current dilemma,
then od is just the utility for you. od stands for Octal Dump,
because it was named before computer users started using
hexadecimal for everything, and because it can dump a file (binary
or not) into almost any form you can imagine.</p><p>So let's see what can be done with od. The easiest thing to
try is to get an octal dump of od itself.
<a href="1326l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a> shows the first 6 lines
of output of the command <b  >od `which od`</b>. There
are several things to notice about this example. (Note: I'm using
an older a.out version of od, so this is might not be exactly what
you see on your system.) By way of explanation, the first column is
the &ldquo;offset&rdquo; into the file, and the remaining columns are the
actual data in the file.</p><p>There are three things to notice about this listing. First,
all the numbers are in octal, or base 8. I'm not aware of anyone
using octal notation for anything anymore. And of course, with the
GNU version of od, there are options for changing how everything
gets displayed&mdash;more on that later.</p><p>Second, all the numbers are 16 bits wide. Since Linux is a
32-bit operating system, this is probably not what you want. Again,
there are ways of modifying this behavior.</p><p>Third, the third line of output contains a single *. This is
od's way of saying that there are many lines just like the previous
line, which have been removed from the output. It then continues
the output at offset (octal) 2000, which is the first line that
differs from the previous line. (Can you guess that this behavior
can also be modified? It can.)</p><p>As mentioned earlier, od has many options for formatting the
output. The first one to mention is <b  >-t xS</b> or
<b  >-t xL</b>, which will cause the output to be in
hexadecimal (base 16). The <b  >S</b> or
<b  >L</b> modifier tells od to read 16 bits
(<b  >S</b>) or 32 bits (<b  >L</b>) at a time.
To all you C programmers, yes, those modifiers stand for &ldquo;short&rdquo;
and &ldquo;long.&rdquo; There are other modifiers as well, and good
descriptions for them can be found in the man page for od.
<a href="1326l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> shows the first six
lines of output of the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
od -t xS `which od`
</pre><p>od can also output the characters of the file. And if you
want to do some comparisons, you can intersperse the hexadecimal
output with the character output. Just give both types on the
command line (see <a href="1326l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>)
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
od -t xS -t c `which od`
</pre><p>There are a couple of things to note about this example. The
character-type arguments don't take a size modifier&mdash;they just read
one character at a time. That's why we used <b  >-t c</b>
and not <b  >-t cS</b>.</p><p>Also, the ordering of the character data looks strange. The
first 4 bytes in the hexadecimal dump are <b  >010b
0064</b>, while the first 4 bytes in the character dump are
<b  >\v 001 d \0</b>. This is because my Linux machine
runs on an Intel-based chip set, which is a little endian
architecture. Other architectures will print this differently. In
fact, this is the easiest way I know to determine whether the
machine you are running on is big-endian or little-endian. The
actual command to determine this would be something like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
echo abcd | od -t xS
</pre><p>A little-endian machine would output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
0000000 6261 6463 000a
</pre>


while a big-endian machine would output:
<pre     class="programlisting">
0000000 6162 6364 0a00
</pre>


I haven't actually seen Linux on a SPARC or a DEC Alpha chip; I
would guess these Linux systems would be big-endian.
</p><p>Let's get back to the last example. Notice that the character
output of the last example has a lot of backslashes in it. This is
one method od uses to show that the character it is trying to print
is really not a printable character. Another method is to show the
character in octal. Examples of the first method are
<b  >\v</b> and <b  >\0</b> and (at offset
2024). Examples of the second method are <b  >001</b> and
<b  >315</b> (at offsets 0001 and 2017 respectively).
(Offsets are still in hexadecimal&mdash;we're getting to that
problem.)</p><p>If you really hate octal, and want to see the offsets in a
different base, od allows that. The option is <b  >-A
x</b> to see the offsets in hexadecimal, or <b  >-A
d</b> to show the offsets in decimal. (Enough of showing
listings of these commands&mdash;just do it.)</p><p>You might have noticed that od always shows 16 bytes per
line. Of course, you can change this as well, by using the
<b  >-w</b> option. The argument after the -w flag is the
number of bytes to read before outputting a line of text. The
default without the -w flag is 16 (as you can see from all the
examples). The default with the -w flag (i.e. <b  >-w</b>
by itself) is 32. Unfortunately, I couldn't get this option to work
on my machine. Every number I gave (-w20, -w18, -w16) caused od to
report &ldquo;invalid width specification.&rdquo; (I'm using GNU textutils
version 1.9, for what it's worth.)</p><p>Sometimes you want to see the whole file, and not repress any
output. The <b  >-v</b> option tells od to not skip any
lines, and to output everything. This can be useful if you need to
compare two different binary files, and you want to compare the
actual bytes in the files, without skipping any of the
output.</p><p>Finally, all of these options have a long format, as is
standard with GNU utilities. For example, the <b  >-v</b>
switch can be expanded to <b  >--output-duplicates</b>. I
tend to use the long form in scripts, so it is clear to others
exactly what options I'm sending to the program, and the short
forms when I'm just working.</p><p>So, how exactly do you see the escape sequence sent to your
terminal when a curses program positions the cursor? Try the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tput cup 10 10 | od -t c
</pre></div></div>
