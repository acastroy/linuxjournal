    There has been talk about $500 appliances for connecting to the
    Internet. Were those people talking about Linux?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a6580.0x269e1e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>As the Internet grows it becomes a source
for more and more useful but non-technical information. For
example, the U.S. Postal Service has a web page that is very useful
to anyone who wants to mail something. The Internet is also rapidly
becoming the most cost-effective way to transfer information, since
it offers much cheaper delivery than methods such as FAX machines.
</p><p>It is in the best interest of companies using the Internet to
distribute information for everyone to get on the Internet, so as
to eliminate a duplicate channel for distributing information.
While this won't happen overnight, some of them will be willing to
help make it happen.</p><p>To this end, a $350 appliance that connects to your
television has just been announced. However, it requires a TV,
offers poor resolution and the input device is a glorified TV
remote control. It could be used for some basic Internet access,
but it isn't a serious approach to real Internet access.</p><p>What I want to do is encourage the Linux activists out there
to think about proposing Linux as an important part of the
solution. Linux is already a significant player on the web server
end of the picture. Why not use Linux to build this &ldquo;appliance&rdquo;
as well?</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a6580.0x269e3f8"></a>What Is Needed?</h2></div></div><p>Before Linux can be the solution, we need to define the
problem. From what I have read, this appliance is a low-cost
computer system that can connect to the Internet, along with the
necessary software to send and receive electronic mail and browse
the Web. If you have been seriously working with Linux, you
probably think Linux already does this. Well, it does. That is, it
does this job for you, but it is far from an appliance.</p><p>Think of a VCR&mdash;that's an appliance. You buy it, take it
home, plug it into a couple of things, set the time and stations in
your area, and you are up and running. Figure about 30 minutes to
get it out of its box, connected and running.</p><p>Now, remember, lots of people think a VCR is too complicated.
If you talk to VCR owners, you will probably find that quite a few
have the time blinking 12:00, and that many don't know how to
program their VCR to record a program at a time when they will be
away from the TV.</p><p>Now that I have defined the average user, you should have a
better idea of what is needed. In particular, something that is
easier to set up than a VCR that will allow Internet access.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a6580.0x269e608"></a>Can This Be Done?</h2></div></div><p>Yes. And, with Linux? Yes again. In fact, it is more likely
that it can be done with Linux than with other systems, because you
have the source code to work with. And, as Linux is frugal with
resources, it can be done with less investment in hardware.</p><p>Finally, if you do this, will it sell? Again, I feel the
answer is yes. While many people need (or think they need) a
computer system and will go for a low-end Mac or PC with MS
Windows, there are many more people&mdash;millions&mdash;who don't want a
computer, but do want access to information. Chances are that many
of these people will later discover that they do want a word
processor, a way to FAX and other computer-related tasks. If the
cost of entry for the appliance is lower than a computer, lots of
people will start with the appliance. With proper design, this
appliance could also grow up into the other tasks while, of course,
still running Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a6580.0x269e768"></a>How Do We Build It?</h2></div></div><p>The key to success is to create something with
high-functionality and a minimum cost. A basic 486 or 5x86 system
with 16MB RAM and almost any disk should do it. It is probably
worth including a CD-ROM drive in the package&mdash;2x units can be
found for around $30 and this can really simplify things. Checking
out the local computer shopper magazine proves that I could easily
assemble these systems for $800 by buying everything at retail. And
over $200 of this is the price of a monitor. I think this basic
system could be produced for $500 in quantity&mdash;possibly
less.</p><p>Now, this computer isn't good for much unless we can convert
it from a general-purpose computer to an appliance that anyone can
use. While not particularly hard, doing it correctly is the secret.
Here are some considerations that help turn it into an
appliance:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Make it initially boot and load from CD.</p></li><li><p>Use XDM so there is always a graphics
screen.</p></li><li><p>Have some built-in logins like mom and dad.</p></li><li><p>Include support for all reasonable connectivity
options including ISDN.</p></li><li><p>Use diald so connections happen
automatically.</p></li><li><p>Cut a deal with some ISPs and have default connect
files for them.</p></li><li><p>On initial load, the system should ask for
connection information. The questions should, whenever possible, be
multiple choice.</p></li><li><p>Include an automatic backup script for the
configuration files.</p></li><li><p>Include a decent web browser. Maybe Netscape would
finally support Linux if this was done right.</p></li><li><p>Build a web page where the users can get help/more
information, and include this as the default location for the
browser.</p></li></ul></div><p>I think that will get things off to a good start. If a bunch
of readers decide to give this a try, great. I think we could all
learn from the experiences of others. Then, possibly, hardware
manufacturers will realize there really is an opportunity for
selling appliances here.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25a6580.0x269f058"></a>This Is Called Win-Win</h2></div></div><p>There is a real chance for a serious win-win situation here.
If all goes according to plan, there will be millions of new Linux
boxes out there in the world, millions of people will get Internet
access at a lower cost than they would have otherwise, some
hardware manufacturers will make money, and some money will end up
in the hands of people who worked on the software. For the
long-term, these millions of new Linux users will soon want to buy
that word processor, spreadsheet and personal information manager.
Everybody wins.</p></div></div>
