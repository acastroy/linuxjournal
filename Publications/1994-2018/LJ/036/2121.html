    Here are the answers to questions about signal handling and taking care
    of global data when writing multi-threaded programs.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1126580.0x121e4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Perhaps the two most common questions I'm
asked about multi-threaded programming (after &ldquo;what is
multi-threaded programming?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why would you want to do it?&rdquo;)
concern how to handle signals, and how to handle cases where two
concurrent threads use a common function that makes use of global
data, and yet the two threads need thread-specific data from that
function. By definition, global data includes static local
variables which are in truth a kind of global variable. In this
article I'll explain how these questions can be dealt with in C
programs using one of the POSIX (or almost POSIX) multi-threading
packages available for Linux. I live in hope of the day when the
most common question I'm asked about multi-threaded programming is,
&ldquo;Can we give you lots of money to write this simple multi-threaded
application, please?&rdquo; Hey&mdash;I can dream, can't I?
</p><p>All the examples in this article make use of POSIX compliant
functionality. To the best of my knowledge at the time I write
this, there are no fully POSIX-compliant multi-threading libraries
available for Linux. Which of the available libraries is best is
something of a subjective issue. I use Xavier Leroy's LinuxThreads
package, and the code fragments and examples were tested using
version 0.5 of this library. This package can be obtained from
http://pauillac.inria.fr/~xleroy/linuxthreads. Christopher
Provenzano has a good user-level library, although the signal
handling doesn't yet match the spec, and there were still a number
of serious bugs the last time I used it. (These bugs, I believe,
are being worked on.) Other library implementations are also
available. Information on these and other packages can be found in
the comp.programming.threads newsgroup and (to give a less than
exhaustive list):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/proven/pthreads.html</p></li><li><p>http://www.aa.net/~mtp/PCthreads.html</p></li><li><p>ftp://ftp.cs.fsu.edu/pub/PART/PTHREADS</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1126580.0x121e870"></a>Thread-specific data</h2></div></div><p>As I implied above, I use the term &ldquo;global data&rdquo; for any
data which persists beyond normal scoping rules, such as static
local variables. Given a piece of code like:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void foo(void)
{
        static int i = 1;
        printf( "%d\n", i );
        i = 2;
}
</pre><p>the first call to this function will print the value 1, and
all subsequent calls will print the value 2, because the variable
<b  >i</b> and its value persist from one invocation of
the function to the next, rather than disappearing in a puff of
smoke as a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; local variable would. This, at least as far
as POSIX threads are concerned, is global data.
</p><p>It is commonly said (I've said it myself) that using global
data is a bad practice. Whether or not this is true, it is only a
rule of thumb. Certainly there are situations where using global
data can avoid creating artificial circumstances. The previous
article (<i  >Linux Journal</i> Issue 34) explained how
threads can share global data with careful use of mutual exclusion
(<b  >mutex</b>) functions to prevent one thread from
accessing an item of global data while another thread is changing
its value. In this article I will look at a different type of
problem, using a real example from a recent project of mine.</p><p>Consider the case of a virtual reality system where a client
makes several network socket connections to a server. Different
types and priorities of data go down different sockets. High
priority data, such as information about objects immediately in the
field of view of the client, is sent down one socket. Lower
priority data such as texture information, background sounds, or
information about objects which are out of the current field of
view, is sent down another socket to be processed whenever the
client has available time. The server could create a collection of
new threads every time a new client connects to the server,
designating one thread for each of the sockets to be used to talk
to each of the clients. Every one of these threads could use the
same function to send a lump of data (not a technical term) to the
client. The data to be sent details of the client it is to be sent
to, the priority and type of data to be sent could all be held in
global variables, and yet each thread will make use of different
values. So how do we do it?</p><p>As a trivial example, suppose the only global data which our
lump-sending function needs to use is an integer that indicates the
priority of the data. In a non-threaded version, we might have a
global integer called <b  >priority</b> used as in
<a href="2121l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>.</p><p>In the multi-threaded version we don't have a global integer,
instead we have a global key to the integer. It is through the key
that the data can be accessed by means of a number of
functions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><b  >pthread_key_create()</b> to prepare
the key for use</p></li><li><p><b  >pthread_setspecific()</b> to set a
value to thread-specific data</p></li><li><p><b  >pthread_getspecific()</b> to
retrieve the current value</p></li></ol></div><p><b  >pthread_key_create()</b> is called once,
generally before any of the threads which are going to use the key
have been created. <b  >pthread_getspecific()</b> and
<b  >pthread_setspecific()</b> never return an error if
the key that is used as an argument has not been created. The
result of using them on a key which has not been created is
undefined. Something will happen, but it could vary from system to
system, and it can't be caught simply by using good error handling.
This is an excellent source of bugs for the unwary. So our
multi-threaded version might look like
<a href="2121l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>.</p><p>There are a few things to note here:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The implementation of POSIX threads can limit the
number of keys a process may use. The standard states that this
number must be at least 128. The number available in any
implementation can be found by looking at the macro
<b  >PTHREAD_KEYS_MAX</b>. According to this macro,
LinuxThreads currently allows 128 keys.</p></li><li><p>The function
<b  >pthread_key_delete()</b> can be used to dispose of
keys that are no longer needed. Keys, like all &ldquo;normal&rdquo; data
items, vanish when the process exits, so why bother deleting them?
Think of key handling as being similar to file handling. An
unsophisticated program need not close any files that it has
opened, as they will be automatically closed when the program
exits. But since there is a limit to the number of files a program
can have open at one time, the best policy is to close files not
currently being used so that the limit is not exceeded. This policy
also works well for key handling, as you may be limited in the
number of thread-specific data keys a process may have.</p></li><li><p><b  >pthread_getspecific()</b> and
<b  >pthread_setspecific()</b> access thread-specific
data as <b  >void*</b> pointers. This ability can be used
directly (as in Listing 2), if the data item to be accessed can be
cast as type <b  >void*</b>, e.g., an
<b  >int</b> in most, but not necessarily all,
implementations. However, if you want your code to be portable or
if you need to access larger data objects, then each thread must
allocate sufficient memory for the data object, and store the
pointer to the object in the thread-specific data rather than
storing the data itself.</p></li><li><p>If you allocate some memory (using the standard
function <b  >malloc()</b>, for instance) for your
thread-specific data, and the thread exits at some point, what
happens to the allocated memory? Nothing happens, so it leaks, and
this is bad. This is the situation where the extra parameter in the
<b  >pthread_key_create()</b> function comes into use.
This parameter allows you to specify a function to call when a
thread exits, and you use that function to free up any memory that
has been allocated. To prevent a waste of CPU time, this destructor
function is called only in the case where a thread has made use of
that particular key. There's little point in tidying up for a
thread that has nothing to be tidied. When a thread exits because
it called one of the functions <b  >exit()</b>,
<b  >_exit()</b> or <b  >abort()</b>, the
destructor function is not called. Also, note that
<b  >pthread_key_delete()</b> does not cause any
destructors to be called, that using a key that has been deleted
doesn't have a defined behavior, and that
<b  >pthread_getspecific()</b> and
<b  >pthread_setspecific()</b> don't return any error
indications. Tidy up your keys carefully. One day you'll be glad
you did. So a better version of our code is
<a href="2121l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>.</p></li></ol></div><p>Some of this code might look a little strange at first sight.
Using <b  >pthread_getspecific()</b> to store a thread
specific value? The idea is to get the memory location this thread
is to use, and then the thread specific value is stored
there.</p><p>Even if global data is anathema to you, you might still have
good use for thread-specific data. In particular, you might need to
write a multi-threaded version of some existing library code that
is also going to be used in a non-threaded program. A good simple
example is making a version of the standard C libraries fit for use
by multi-threaded programs. That friend of all C programmers,
<b  >errno</b>, is a global variable that is commonly set
by library functions to indicate what went wrong during a function
call. If two threads call functions which both set errno to
different values, at least one of the threads is going to get the
wrong information. This is solved by having thread-specific data
areas for <b  >errno</b>, rather than one global variable
used by all threads.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1126580.0x12165a0"></a>Signal Handling</h2></div></div><p>Many people find signal handling in C to be a bit tricky at
the best of times. Multi-threaded applications need a little extra
care when it comes to signal handling, but once you've written two
programs, you'll wonder what all the fuss was about&mdash;trust me. And
if you start to panic, remember&mdash;deep, slow breaths.</p><p>A quick re-cap of what signals are. Signals are the system's
way of informing a process about various events. There are two
types of signals, synchronous and asynchronous.</p><p>Synchronous signals are a result of a program action. Two
examples are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p><b  >SIGFPE</b>, floating-point
exception, is returned when the program tries to do some illegal
mathematical operation such as dividing by zero.</p></li><li><p><b  >SIGSEGV</b>, segmentation violation,
is returned when the program tries to access an area of memory
outside the area it can legally access.</p></li></ol></div><p>Asynchronous signals are independent of the program. For
example, the signal sent when the user gives the
<b  >kill</b> command.</p><p>In non-threaded applications there are three usual ways of
handling signals:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Pretend they don't exist, perhaps the most common
policy, and quite adequate for lots of simple programs&mdash;at least
until you want your program to be reliable and useful.</p></li><li><p>Use <b  >signal()</b> to set up a signal
handler&mdash;nice and simple, but not very robust.</p></li><li><p>Use the POSIX signal handling functions such as
<b  >sigaction()</b> and <b  >sigprocmask()</b>
to set up a signal handler or to ignore certain signals&mdash;the
&ldquo;proper&rdquo; method.</p></li></ol></div><p>If you choose the first option, then signals will have some
default behavior. Typically, this default behavior will cause the
program to exit or cause the program to ignore the signal,
depending on what the signal is. The latter two options allow you
to change the default behavior for each signal type&mdash;ignore the
signal, cause the program to exit or invoke a signal-handling
function to allow your program to perform some special processing.
Avoid the use of the old-style <b  >signal()</b>
function. Whether you're writing threaded or non-threaded
applications, the extra complications of the POSIX-style functions
are worth the effort. Note that the behavior of
<b  >sigprocmask()</b>, which sets a signal mask for a
process, is undefined in a multi-threaded program. There is a new
function, <b  >pthread_sigmask()</b>, that is used in
much the same way as <b  >sigprocmask()</b>, but it sets
the signal mask only for the current thread. Also, a new thread
inherits the signal mask of the thread that created it; so a signal
mask can effectively be set for an entire process by calling
<b  >pthread_sigmask()</b> before any threads are
created.</p><p>In a multi-threaded application, there is always the question
of which thread the signal will actually be delivered to. Or does
it get delivered to all the threads?</p><p>To answer the last question first, no. If one signal is
generated, one signal is delivered, so any single signal will only
be delivered to a single thread.</p><p>So which thread will get the signal? If it is a synchronous
signal, the signal is delivered to the thread that generated it.
Synchronous signals are commonly managed by having an appropriate
signal handler set up in each thread to handle any that aren't
masked. If it is an asynchronous signal, it could go to any of the
threads that haven't masked out that signal using
<b  >sigprocmask()</b>. This makes life even more
complicated. For instance, suppose your signal handler must access
a global variable. This is normally handled quite happily by using
<b  >mutex</b>, as follows:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
void signal_handler( int sig )
{
        ...
        pthread_mutex_lock( &amp;mutex1 );
        ...
        pthread_mutex_unlock( &amp;mutex1 );
        ...
}
</pre><p>Looks fine at first sight. However, what if the thread that
was interrupted by the signal had just itself locked
<b  >mutex1</b>? The <b  >signal_handler()</b>
function will block, and will wait for the mutex to be unlocked.
And the thread that is currently holding the mutex will not
restart, and so will not be able to release the mutex until the
signal handler exits. A nice deadly embrace.
</p><p>So a common way of handling asynchronous signals in a
multi-threaded program is to mask signals in all the threads, and
then create a separate thread (or threads) whose sole purpose is to
catch signals and handle them. The signal-handler thread catches
signals by calling the function <b  >sigwait()</b> with
details of the signals it wishes to wait for. To give a simple
example of how this might be done, take a look at
<a href="2121l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, a thread inherits its signal mask from
the thread which creates it. The <b  >main()</b> function
sets the signal mask to block all signals, so all threads created
after this point will have all signals blocked, including the
signal-handling thread. Strange as it may seem at first sight, this
is exactly what we want. The signal-handling thread expects signal
information to be provided by the <b  >sigwait()</b>
function, not directly by the operating system.
<b  >sigwait()</b> will unmask the set of signals that
are given to it, and then will block until one of those signals
occurs.</p><p>Also, you might think that this program will deadlock, if a
signal is raised while the main thread holds the mutex
<b  >sig_mutex</b>. After all, the signal handler tries
to grab that same mutex, and it will block until that mutex comes
free. However, the main thread is ignoring signals, so there is
nothing to prevent another thread from gaining control while the
signal handling thread is blocked. In this case,
<b  >sig_handler()</b> hasn't caught a signal in the
usual, non-threaded sense. Instead it has asked the operating
system to tell it when a signal has been raised. The operating
system has performed this function, and so the signal handling
thread becomes just another running thread.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1126580.0x12176d0"></a>Differences in Signal Handling between POSIX
Threads and LinuxThreads</h2></div></div><p>Listing 4 shows how to deal with signals in a multi-threading
environment that handles threads in a POSIX compliant way.</p><p>Personally, I like the kernel-level package &ldquo;LinuxThreads&rdquo;
that makes use of Linux 2.0's <b  >clone()</b> system
call to create new threads. At some point in the future, the
<b  >clone()</b> call may implement the
<b  >CLONE_PID</b> flag which would allow all the threads
to share a process ID. Until then each thread created using
&ldquo;LinuxThreads&rdquo; (or any other packages which chooses to use
<b  >clone()</b> to create threads) will have its own
unique process ID. As such, there is no concept of sending a signal
to &ldquo;the process.&rdquo; If one thread calls
<b  >sigwait()</b> and all other threads block signals,
only those signals which are specifically sent to the
<b  >sigwait()</b>-ing thread will be processed.
Depending on your application, this could mean that you have no
choice other than to include an asynchronous signal handler in each
of the threads.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1126580.0x1217a40"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Thread specific data is easy to use&mdash;far easier than many
people's first experiences may suggest. In a way, this ease of use
is a disadvantage, since very often there are more elegant
solutions to a problem. But in times of need, thread specific data
is your friend.</p><p>On the other hand, signal handling in anger can be a little
hairy. Anyone who thinks otherwise has overlooked something&mdash;either
that or they're far too clever for their own good. Make life easier
for yourself by consigning all the handling of asynchronous signals
to one thread that sits on <b  >sigwait()</b>.</p></div></div>
