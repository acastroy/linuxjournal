    Designing quizzes the easy way using CGI.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19de450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Over the last few months, we have looked
at a number of techniques that CGI programmers can use to work on
their programs. This month, we will look at a multiple-choice quiz
system that uses a combination of techniques to create a simple,
but effective, system for creating quizzes for our users. By the
end of this short project, you will have not only a good idea of
how to implement this type of interaction, but a working
four-question quiz, as well.
</p><p>Before we can begin, we will need to decide on a file format
which will contain the questions and answers for our quiz. We could
put all of the questions and answers inside of the program itself,
but moving them to one or more external files will let us reuse the
software with other quizzes on our system. Given that this is a
simple quiz, let's say that the questions and answers for each quiz
are stored in a file whose name is the same as the quiz name. Thus
the quiz named &ldquo;presidents&rdquo; will be stored in a file named
&ldquo;presidents&rdquo;, while the quiz named &ldquo;unix&rdquo; is stored in a file
named &ldquo;unix&rdquo;.</p><p>Now that we have decided on filenames, we need to decide on a
format for the contents of the file. Let's take the easy route, and
put one question and its associated possible answers on each line
in the file, each separated by tabs, and ending with the letter
&ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;b&rdquo;, &ldquo;c&rdquo; or &ldquo;d&rdquo;, that corresponds to the correct
answer.</p><p>So that the file can contain comments and whitespace, we'll
say that any line beginning with a hash mark (#) is considered a
comment, to be ignored. The same goes for any line consisting
solely of whitespace. Allowing for comments and whitespace makes it
possible for us to comment out questions that we no longer want to
use, without having to delete them altogether.</p><p>Here is a sample quiz on the subject of cranberries, which we
will put in a file named, oddly enough, &ldquo;cranberries&rdquo;:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
# This is the quiz file about cranberries.
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
# Comment lines contain a hash mark (#) in the
# first column, and are ignored, as are lines
# containing only whitespace.
</pre><pre     class="programlisting">
What color are cranberries?     Red     White\
        Blue    Dark green      A
What can you make with cranberries?     Muffins\
        Sauce   Steak   A and B D
</pre><p>Note that the questions and answers in this file can contain
space characters, but <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> tab characters. This
will typically not affect things very much, but it is a
consideration to keep in mind. Also, while each line can be as long
as needed, the question and its associated answers
<span   class="bold"><b>must</b></span> remain on a single line of
text (that is, must end in a carriage return).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19de8c8"></a>Creating an Object</h2></div></div><p>Our quiz program actually consists of two different programs
working in concert with each other. The first,
<b  >askquestion.pl</b>, produces an HTML form that
presents the user with a question and a list of possible answers.
That form will be submitted to another CGI program,
<b  >checkanswer.pl</b>, which determines whether the
user has selected the correct answer.</p><p>Because both of these CGI programs will have to access the
same quiz file, it is probably a good idea to centralize such
functions in a single Perl 5 object. Such an object would have to
read the file and return a question of our choosing from the list
of available questions. To make things a bit more interesting, this
object should include a method that retrieves a random question
from the file, which makes the quiz less predictable for the
user.</p><p>The object that we will use in our quiz program is shown in
<a href="2112l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. All this code means is
that you can place a:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
use QuizQuestions;
</pre><p>statement near the top of both CGI programs to create a Perl
object that reads the questions to the &ldquo;cranberries&rdquo; quiz. To do
this, you can use this statement:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my $quiz = new QuizQuestions("cranberries");
</pre>


For example, you could retrieve the fifth question with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my @question = $quiz-&gt;getQuestion(5);
</pre>


or a random question with:
<pre     class="programlisting">
my @question = $quiz-&gt;getRandomQuestion;
</pre>


As you can see, the <b  >QuizQuestion</b> object in
Listing 1 has nothing to do with CGI programming per se. Even if we
were creating a quiz system that wouldn't be used on the Web, this
object would be a good starting point. By using an object to
represent our data, we have also made it possible to change the
file format we are using without modifying the CGI programs that
access the data. If we were so inclined, we would be able to move
the quiz data into an SQL table, and access it via a database
client from within Perl. As long as the interface to the outside
world remains the same, our CGI programs wouldn't care.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19ded98"></a>Asking the Right Questions</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have created a fairly simple interface to the
quiz data, let's create the first of our two programs,
<b  >askquestion.pl</b>. This program produces an HTML
form which not only asks a question, but also lets the user choose
an answer by clicking on the appropriate radio button.</p><p>One possible version of the program, shown in
<a href="2112l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a>, is fairly
straightforward. It creates one instance of CGI, an object which
helps us write CGI programs, and one instance of QuizQuestions, the
object we created above. After instantiating these two objects, we
then produce a simple HTML form containing four radio buttons that
correspond to each possible answer. We then create a submit button
and a reset button, and finish creating the HTML form.</p><p>However, we also create a hidden field that contains the
number of the question the user is answering. This number is
returned by the <b  >getQuestion</b> and
<b  >getRandomQuestion</b> methods within QuizQuestions.
If you didn't understand previously why we needed to return these
values along with the questions and answers, perhaps it will be
clearer now. HTTP is a stateless protocol&mdash;every request made to a
server is independent of any other requests made to it. The quiz
requires at least two connections to the HTTP server&mdash;one to get
the question and produce a form with
<b  >askquestion.pl</b>, and a second to submit the
user's response and check the answer,
<b  >checkanswer.pl</b>.</p><p>The problem is that <b  >checkanswer.pl</b> can
verify only that the user's answer is correct if it knows which
question the user was asked. Since
<b  >checkanswer.pl</b> is invoked with a separate
request to the HTTP server it cannot know which question was
selected, unless we have some way of passing that message from the
invocation <b  >askquestion.pl</b>.</p><p>We could have used the hidden field to pass the correct
answer along to checkanswer.pl, but this is a bad idea because
hidden fields are hidden only from obvious view. If a user were
interested in finding the correct answer, he or she would be able
to look at the page's HTML source, which would quickly reveal the
answer. This way, users know only which question is being asked,
not which answer is correct.</p><p>Also note that the name of the quiz comes from the query
string, which is passed to us in the
<b  >QUERY_STRING</b> environment variable. This lets us,
as mentioned above, use the same quiz program for multiple
programs. By changing the value placed in the query string, you can
turn this pair of programs into many different quizzes, each with
its own set of questions and answers. When we set the
<b  >action</b> attribute in the
<b  >&lt;Form&gt;</b> tag, we make sure that it includes
not only the name of the program to which the form should be
submitted, <b  >checkanswer.pl</b>, but also the name of
the quiz, which appears in the query string.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19df4d0"></a>Ending the Suspense</h2></div></div><p>As we saw earlier, the form generated by
<b  >askquestion.pl</b> is submitted to a second CGI
program, <b  >checkanswer.pl</b>. Checkanswer.pl opens
the list of questions, retrieves the question that the user was
asked by retrieving the value of the
<b  >questionNumber</b> form element, which is hidden in
the form, and checks the user's answer against the correct
one.</p><p>If the user answers the question correctly, the program
displays a &ldquo;congratulations&rdquo; headline along with the correct
answer, and asks if the user would like another question.</p><p>If the user answers the question incorrectly, the program
displays the correct answer, offers some consolation, and asks the
user if he or she would like to continue.</p><p>Now you can see why you need the getQuestion and the
getRandomQuestion method. With getQuestion alone, you can retrieve
a question, but not a random selection from the list of questions.
But if you had only getRandomQuestion, you would not be able to
retrieve the question that the user had asked, and thus would not
be able to check the user's answer against the correct one.</p><p>The source code for <b  >checkanswer.pl</b> is in
<a href="2112l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>. One obvious flaw of
this implementation is that if the site administrator decides to
modify the questions file between the time the user receives the
question and when he or she submits the form, the question might be
marked as wrong. That's because the programs expect the order of
the questions will not be modified between the time the question is
asked and when it is answered. If you were to insert a new question
at the top of the file, this would turn question 1 into question 2,
question 2 into question 3 and so on&mdash;which would mean that
checkanswer.pl would compare the user's answer with an answer to a
different question.</p><p>Note that we used Perl's <b  >eval</b> function to
get the actual text of the answer. Perhaps this is simply a
personal hang-up, but I hate it when I am told that I answered
incorrectly, but no one tells me what the correct answer was. We
could have stored the answers in an associative array, but I
decided that it would be interesting to use <b  >eval</b>
to get the value of a variable. In this case, we concatenate the
string &ldquo;$answer&rdquo; and the value of $rightAnswer, giving us one of
the four possible strings &ldquo;$answerA&rdquo;, &ldquo;$answerB&rdquo;, &ldquo;$answerC&rdquo;
or &ldquo;$answerD&rdquo;. <b  >eval</b> is handed that string and
returns the value of the variable named in the string.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18e6580.0x19dfa50"></a>The Initial HTML</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have defined QuizQuestions, askquestion.pl and
checkanswer.pl, all that remains is to create an HTML file that
acts as the initial entrance into the quiz.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;Head&gt;
&lt;Title&gt;Play our quiz!&lt;/Title&gt;
&lt;/Head&gt;
&lt;Body&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Play our quiz!&lt;/H1&gt;
&lt;P&gt;You can play our cranberry quiz by clicking
&lt;a href="/cgi-bin/askquestion.pl?cranberries"&gt;
here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/Body&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
</pre><p>Notice that the URL leading to the initial question must have
a quiz name appended to it in the query string. Other than that,
though, this is a simple HTML document.
</p><p>This quiz appears to work pretty well so far, although there
are certainly features that you might add&mdash;such as a scoreboard,
better error-checking when reading the quiz file, or a system that
ensures that users don't see the same question twice.</p><p>But more important than any of these is the fact that while
the format of the question file is easy for programmers to
understand, non-programmers who would like to add, delete or modify
questions might find the format confusing. Next month we will work
on making this system more author-friendly, so that non-programmers
can modify entries in the question file via an HTML form.</p></div></div>
