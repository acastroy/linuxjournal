Feature-rich PostgreSQL delivers on database integrity.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2d580.0x1c252f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you're developing an application that depends on storing and
retrieving large amounts of data, you undoubtedly have discovered
how useful a relational database can be. Databases have been around
for a while, but for many years, the open-source offerings were
inferior to their commercial counterparts. Today, we have several
open-source options from which to choose. Last month, I gave an overview of
MySQL, which is probably the most popular open-source, client-server
relational database.
</p><p>
This month, we look at MySQL's best-known competitor, PostgreSQL.
(Next month, I plan to compare the two programs.) PostgreSQL has a
smaller community than MySQL, which sometimes leads people to write it
off, think of it as unimportant or even believe that it's not as
powerful as MySQL. But, PostgreSQL includes nearly all the
functionality of MySQL, and it offers a large number of features that
MySQL does not currently offer. As this article shows, it's
worth considering PostgreSQL any time you need a database.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2d580.0x1c25450"></a>
History</h2></div></div><p>
PostgreSQL began as a research project at the University of
California, Berkeley, in 1985. Michael Stonebreaker, a professor of
computer science, already had developed and released one database
product known as Ingres. After commercializing Ingres, he returned
to Berkeley and designed a new database (Postgres), meant in part
to solve the problems he had seen with Ingres. Despite a growing
community of users, Stonebreaker shut down the Postgres project in
1993.
</p><p>
However, Postgres was distributed under the BSD open-source license,
which meant users were free to modify and redistribute it. Two
Berkeley students, along with a handful of people from elsewhere in
North America, decided to see how easily they could modify the code
and distribute a working database.
</p><p>
One of the changes these developers made was in the way
Postgres communicated to the outside world. Originally, Postgres had
used the QUEL query language that Stonebreaker had designed for
Ingres. The developers removed QUEL and added an SQL interpreter to
be more compatible with other products. To indicate that this version
of Postgres used SQL, the database was renamed PostgreSQL.
</p><p>
Today, many of those original developers continue to work with the
project, fixing bugs and contributing patches. The effort is
coordinated by a volunteer steering committee. Individual PostgreSQL
developers may be hired (as employees or contractors) by various
companies, but no one company or organization controls the development
or direction of PostgreSQL as a whole.
</p><p>
The most recent release of PostgreSQL is 8.2.3, released in early
February 2007. This was a bug-fix release for version 8.2, which was
released in late 2006. Major releases typically come out once per
year, with additional minor releases for security and other serious
bugs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2d580.0x1c256b8"></a>
Installation</h2></div></div><p>
The easiest way to install PostgreSQL is to use a packaging system,
such as debs or RPMs. On my Ubuntu system, for example, I was able to
install PostgreSQL easily and quickly with apt-get. Note that
most packaging systems distinguish between the PostgreSQL client,
server and developer libraries, so be sure to retrieve the packages
that are most appropriate for your needs. Installing PostgreSQL
via apt-get or RPMs should achieve everything you need to get
started&mdash;from creating a postgres user to initializing a data directory.
</p><p>
If you must install PostgreSQL from source, I suggest reading
the documentation that comes with it. Compiling PostgreSQL is not
hard, but it does require more description than I have room for in
this article. One piece of advice though, for anyone
compiling it from scratch, is to unpack the archive, as
well as compile and test it, as the postgres user. Trying to
compile and test PostgreSQL as the root user is bound to fail, and
other users also might not have sufficient privileges for it to work
correctly.
</p><p>
Now, we're ready to start up the server. Prebuilt packages
generally will include a shell script (to be placed in /etc/init.d/ or the
equivalent) that starts the server for you. Even if you have
downloaded and installed the source code for PostgreSQL, you will find
an appropriate startup script in the contrib directory. I suggest
using (or at least modifying) this script rather than writing one from
scratch. On my system, I can start PostgreSQL with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">/etc/init.d/postgresql start</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2d580.0x1c258c8"></a>
Simple Connections</h2></div></div><p>
If all goes well, our server should now be running. (We can check
this by typing <tt  >ps aux | grep postgres</tt> at the command line.) The
easiest way to access the server is to use the psql interactive
client, which comes with PostgreSQL. To get a list of databases in
the current cluster, use the following syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
psql -U &lt;username&gt; -l
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2d580.0x1c25a80"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where &lt;username&gt; is a PostgreSQL user with sufficient access
privileges on the server. The -U option lets us indicate the
user name, and the -l option asks the server to list those databases that are
available, such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">List of databases
    Name   |    Owner  | Encoding
-----------+-----------+-----------
testserver | reuven    | SQL_ASCII
postgres   | postgres  | SQL_ASCII
template0  | postgres  | SQL_ASCII
template1  | postgres  | SQL_ASCII
(4 rows)</pre><p>
Like many database systems, PostgreSQL maintains its own list of users
and groups separately from the underlying operating system.
To create a new user, we use the createuser
program, which comes with PostgreSQL:</p><pre     class="programlisting">createuser -U postgres reuven</pre><p>
This invokes createuser as postgres (which has permission to
create other users) and then creates a new user named reuven.
If we make this new user a superuser, reuven also will be
allowed to create new databases and roles.
</p><p>
Now, we can create a new database in this cluster:</p><pre     class="programlisting">createdb -U reuven linux</pre><p>
Double-check that the database exists with a reuse of psql
-l:</p><pre     class="programlisting">psql -U reuven -l</pre><p>
You might have noticed that we have not given a password any time we
have invoked a command that required a user. The
default setting for PostgreSQL makes the server available via a local
socket (and thus unavailable over the network). Because only local
users will be allowed access, we allow connections from any defined
user name, even without a password.
</p><p>
We can change this behavior, as well as other security- and
connection-related behaviors, in the pg_hba.conf file located at the
top of the cluster directory. The file contains extensive
documentation and explains how to set up the connection
parameters.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2d580.0x1c25ef8"></a>
Creating a Table</h2></div></div><p>
Let's connect to our database and see what happens:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$ psql -U reuven linux</pre><p>
Sure enough, we get the psql prompt, inviting us to enter a query. A
list of psql comments is available by typing <tt  >\?</tt> at
the prompt. We also can
get help with SQL syntax and commands with \h, as in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">\h CREATE TABLE</pre><p>
Sure enough, let's start by creating a table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE People (
    id    SERIAL    NOT NULL,
    first_name    TEXT    NOT NULL,
    last_name    TEXT    NOT NULL,
    email_address    TEXT NOT NULL,
    added_at    TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL  DEFAULT NOW(),

    PRIMARY KEY(id),
    UNIQUE(email_address)
);</pre><p>
This table has five columns and three different data types. The most
common type is TEXT, which is the typical way to store textual data.
PostgreSQL has full support for Unicode, and TEXT columns may contain
very long strings. (Until version 8.0, PostgreSQL could store a
limited amount of data in each row, so this might come as news to some
people.) There is no built-in support for indexing TEXT columns, but
an add-on module, called tsearch2, is relatively easy to install and
provides such functionality for anyone who needs it.
</p><p>
The added_at column is of type TIMESTAMP. PostgreSQL provides a very
sophisticated set of time- and date-handling routines, thanks to the
division between two basic data types, known as TIMESTAMP and INTERVAL.
A timestamp indicates when something happened, whereas an interval
tells you how long something took. We thus can subtract two
timestamps (to get an interval) or add an interval to a timestamp (to
get a new timestamp). Moreover, PostgreSQL lets us define intervals
using English-like syntax, such as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">SELECT id FROM People WHERE added_at &gt; NOW ()
 &#8618;- interval '30 days';</pre><p>
The above query shows us all of the people who were added to our
contact database in the last 30 days.
</p><p>
The added_at column defines a DEFAULT value as well. This means that
if we fail to INSERT an explicit value for added_at, PostgreSQL will
use the current time (at the time of insertion).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2d580.0x1c26420"></a>
The SERIAL Data Type</h2></div></div><p>
The id column, which we define to be our primary key, uses a SERIAL
data type. The thing is, SERIAL isn't a data type at all. Rather, it's
syntactic sugar that does several things:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
It creates a new sequence object, whose values are integers
that start at 1 and increase each time we ask for a value.
</p></li><li><p>
It defines the column type to be INTEGER.
</p></li><li><p>
It sets the DEFAULT clause for our column to be the result of
requesting a new value from the sequence.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This might sound like a complicated way of saying, &ldquo;SERIAL gives us an
auto-incrementing column&rdquo;. And that's true, in a sense, but you can
have as many SERIAL columns as you like in a table, and each sequence
can have all sorts of properties associated with it, including its
starting point and increment.
</p><p>
Finally, by defining id to be a primary key and email_address to
be unique, we implicitly ask PostgreSQL to create indexes on these two
columns. When we execute the above query, PostgreSQL notifies us what
it's doing behind the scenes:</p><pre     class="programlisting">NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE will create implicit sequence
"people_id_seq" for serial column "people.id"
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create
implicit index "people_pkey" for table "people"
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / UNIQUE will create implicit
index "people_email_address_key" for table "people"</pre><p>
If and when you drop the People table, these implicitly defined
objects are dropped automatically.
</p><p>
To list all of the tables, sequences and views in our database, we
can use the \d command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">linux=# \d
     List of relations
 Schema |     Name      |   Type   | Owner
--------+---------------+----------+--------
 public | people        | table    | reuven
 public | people_id_seq | sequence | reuven
(2 rows)</pre><p>
We can add a letter to \d to get a list of only tables (t), indexes
(i), sequences (s), functions (f) or views (v). For example, here is
a list of the indexes that we have created:</p><pre     class="programlisting">linux=# \di
          List of relations
Schema |           Name           | Type  | Owner  | Table
-------+--------------------------+-------+--------+-------
public | people_email_address_key | index | reuven | people
public | people_pkey              | index | reuven | people
(2 rows)</pre><p>
We can also use \d to inspect a particular object more closely. For
example, we can look at our People table with <tt  >\d
People</tt>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">linux=# \d People
                   Table "public.people"
Column        |      Type                   |  Modifiers
--------------+-----------------------------+----------
id            | integer                     | not null default
nextval('people_id_seq'::regclass)
first_name    | text                        | not null
last_name     | text                        | not null
email_address | text                        | not null
added_at      | timestamp without time zone | not null default now()
Indexes:
"people_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
"people_email_address_key" UNIQUE, btree (email_address)</pre><p>
There are several things to notice in the above output:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
First, PostgreSQL sees the table as public.people, not
just people. This is because every object must exist inside
of a schema, or namespace, and the default schema is called
public. We can use schemas to partition the namespace within
a particular database or to handle partitions. This means
we don't need to split data across two more databases just to
deal with conflicting permissions and names.
</p></li><li><p>
The table name, as well as all column names, are displayed in
lowercase letters. That's because PostgreSQL tries to adhere to
the SQL standard as best as possible, and the standard says that
identifiers should be case-insensitive. If you really want
case-sensitive names (and you probably don't), use
double quotes around the identifiers.
</p></li><li><p>
Our id column has been transformed, as expected, into an
integer column with a default value taken from a sequence.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2d580.0x1c1d7b0"></a>
Constraints</h2></div></div><p>
There are some problems with our table definition. Although we have
effectively stopped people from storing NULL values in our TEXT
columns, we haven't done anything to stop them from entering empty
strings. In addition, we might want to ensure that the email_address
column looks at least something like an e-mail address.
</p><p>
We can do this by adding constraints to our columns&mdash;tiny functions
that check the value being inserted or updated. If the new
value doesn't fit the definition, PostgreSQL refuses to allow its
insertion. Here's a new definition of our table, with some
constraints defined:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (
  id    SERIAL    NOT NULL,
  first_name    TEXT    NOT NULL  CHECK (first_name &lt;&gt; ''),
  last_name    TEXT    NOT NULL CHECK (last_name &lt;&gt; ''),
  email_address    TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (email_address ~* '.@.+\\\.'),
  added_at    TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL  DEFAULT NOW(),

  PRIMARY KEY(id),
  UNIQUE(email_address)
);
</pre><p>
If we inspect our table definition, it has changed somewhat, to
include the constraints:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
linux=# \d people
                  Table "public.people"
    Column    |            Type             |      Modifiers
--------------+-----------------------------+----------------------
id            | integer                     | not null default
nextval('people_id_seq'::regclass)
first_name    | text                        | not null
last_name     | text                        | not null
email_address | text                        | not null
added_at      | timestamp without time zone | not null default now()
  Indexes:
  "people_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
  "people_email_address_key" UNIQUE, btree (email_address)
  Check constraints:
  "people_email_address_check" CHECK (email_address ~* '.@.+\\.'::text)
  "people_first_name_check" CHECK (first_name &lt;&gt; ''::text)
  "people_last_name_check" CHECK (last_name &lt;&gt; ''::text)
</pre><p>
Let's see what happens if we violate these constraints:</p><pre     class="programlisting">linux=# insert into people (first_name , last_name, email_address)
    values ('', 'Lerner', 'reuven@lerner.co.il');
ERROR:  new row for relation "people" violates check constraint
    "people_first_name_check"

linux=# insert into people (first_name , last_name, email_address)
    values ('Reuven2', 'Lerner2', 'reuven');
ERROR:  new row for relation "people" violates check constraint
    "people_email_address_check"</pre><p>
Sure enough, our constraints help to ensure that our database is in
order.
</p><p>
The most common type of constraint is a foreign key, in which one
table points to another. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">CREATE TABLE Appointments (
    person_id    INTEGER     NOT NULL  REFERENCES People,
    starting_time    TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    duration           INTERVAL NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT NULL
);</pre><p>
If we try to create an appointment that refers to a non-existent
person, we will be rejected:</p><pre     class="programlisting">INSERT INTO Appointments (person_id, starting_time, duration, notes)
    VALUES (5000, '2007-Feb-12 13:00', interval '1 hour', 'Lunch');

ERROR: insert or update on table "appointments" violates foreign key
constraint "appointments_person_id_fkey"
DETAIL: Key (person_id)=(5000) is not present in table "people".</pre><p>
Foreign-key constraints help in the other direction as well. If you
try to drop a row to which a foreign key points, PostgreSQL will
refuse the request, indicating that you must first delete the foreign
key. You can adjust the rules for these constraints by setting the ON
UPDATE or ON DELETE modifiers to the foreign key definition.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b2d580.0x1c1de90"></a>
Other Features</h2></div></div><p>
This list of features is just the tip of the iceberg. And that's part
of the magic of PostgreSQL&mdash;out of the box, it's straightforward and
easy to use, but you almost always can redefine and extend existing
functionality with your own code and data. The built-in operators,
along with the flexible ways in which they can be combined and
further enhanced with your own functions and definitions, make for a
powerful combination. I don't often use unions or intersections, but
I do often use views.
</p><p>
For example, one of my favorite features is the ability to use
subselects just about anywhere you would have a value. If you have
someone's e-mail address, you can use that to INSERT a row into
Appointments in a single command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">INSERT INTO Appointments (person_id, starting_time, duration, notes)
    VALUES ((SELECT id
                 FROM People
               WHERE email_address = 'reuven@lerner.co.il'),
            '2007-Feb-12 13:00', interval '1 hour', 'Lunch');</pre><p>
If the existing data types aren't enough, we can construct our own.
PostgreSQL already comes with a number of existing data types,
including geometric shapes, IP addresses and even ISBNs.
</p><p>
If we want to create more than one table with similar characteristics,
we can take advantage of PostgreSQL's object-oriented features. Thus,
we could have a People table and a Managers table, in which the
definition of Manager inherits the characteristics of People and adds
its own extensions.
</p><p>
You also can create your own server-side functions, in a variety of
different languages&mdash;from PostgreSQL's own Pl/pgsql to specialized
versions of Perl, Python, Tcl, Java, Ruby and the R statistical
language. These functions can return individual values or entire
tables, and can be used in triggers. You also can use these functions
to rewrite the rules for inserting, updating and deleting data from a
table or even a view.
</p><p>
But, perhaps the most important feature of all is the built-in support
for transactions. Transactions are an essential part of database
programming, in that they allow us to combine multiple queries into
one all-or-nothing action. The classic example of a transaction is
the movement of money from one bank account to another; if the power
goes out, you want to be sure that the money was moved, or that
it wasn't. It would be unacceptable for the money to disappear
altogether or for it to appear in both accounts when the lights come
back on.
</p><p>
Recent versions of PostgreSQL have enhanced its transactional
capabilities. Not only can you commit or roll back a transaction, but
you also can define savepoints inside a transaction. If
something goes wrong, you can either roll back the entire transaction
or merely go to the previous savepoint. Moreover, PostgreSQL now
supports two-phase commits, making it possible to synchronize
distributed processes that require communication and coordination.
</p><p>
If anything goes wrong, PostgreSQL also provides a PITR (point-in-time
recovery) through a write-ahead log (WAL), ensuring that even if the
power is cut off at the most critical moment, transactions will be
committed or rolled back, and that as many transactions as possible
will be committed.
</p><p>
You might have noticed that I haven't mentioned locking at all. That's
because, for the most part, PostgreSQL users don't have to worry about
locking. The lack of locking is handled using a system known as MVCC
(multiversion concurrency control), which has only one drawback,
namely the creation of many unused and cast-off database rows. The
traditional way to handle this in PostgreSQL is to VACUUM
the database regularly, removing old rows and clearing up space. Recent
versions now include an auto-vacuum agent, reducing or even
eliminating the need to VACUUM on a regular basis.
</p><p>
Finally, recent versions of PostgreSQL include support for
tablespaces. This means you can spread tables across different
directories and filesystems, rather than keep everything under the
directory defined by your installation. This can boost
performance or reliability significantly, particularly on large databases.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Don't think of PostgreSQL as a powerful open-source database. Rather,
think of it as a powerful database that happens to be released under
an open-source license. It has a wealth of features that make it
scalable for large systems and needs, but it is easily approachable by
novices who want to begin their journey into the world of relational
databases.
