Firebug is a brilliant means of debugging Ajax applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2082580.0x217a3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
During the past year or two, Web developers have witnessed what we might
call the JavaScript renaissance. That's because all the fancy
Ajax, Web 2.0, mashup, interactive, collaborative, desktop-like
applications that are being developed are written in JavaScript. This
is possible today not only because the JavaScript language has
improved, but also because browsers are increasingly compliant with
Web standards. And, of course, the availability of cross-platform
JavaScript libraries, such as Prototype, has added many features to
the language, while simultaneously ensuring cross-platform
compatibility.
</p><p>
So, with all the JavaScript development happening today, what is the
most popular way to debug programs? That's right, it's the built-in
alert function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">alert("value of x = '" + x + "'");</pre><p>
Alerts might be unpleasant, ugly and downright annoying, but they
have been the best and easiest way to debug JavaScript for several
years. Sure, there have been a few JavaScript debuggers, but none of
them has been all that exciting to use, let alone easy or productive.
</p><p>
Well, I'm happy to say that the situation has now changed. Firebug is
an open-source plugin for the Firefox browser that aims to be a
one-stop debugging tool not only for JavaScript, but also for everything
that a Web developer needs. Written by Joe Hewitt, one of the
founders of the small startup Parakey, Firebug 1.0 was released in
early 2007. It already has become wildly popular among Web
developers, and for good reason.
</p><p>
This month, we look at Firebug, so that we can debug, inspect
and optimize modern Web pages. Firebug already has
improved my ability to debug modern Web pages dramatically, and I wouldn't be
surprised if this turns out to be the case for many other Web
developers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2082580.0x217a710"></a>
Installing Firebug</h2></div></div><p>
Firebug is distributed as an extension for the Firefox Web browser.
It is most easily downloaded and installed from the Firebug site (<a href="http://www.getfirebug.com" target="_self">www.getfirebug.com</a>). To install it, click on the download
Firebug button. If you already have told Firefox this is an
allowed download site, you will be able to download and
install this Mozilla extension. If not, you need to add
getfirebug.com to your list of trusted download sites, and then repeat
the download procedures. Once the extension is installed,
restart Firefox.
</p><p>
Once you do this, your Web browser will look much the same as before,
but with some small changes. First, there now will be an icon
at the bottom of the screen in the status line. This icon will
look like either a green V in a circle (to indicate that it is
running) or a gray circle with a slash through it (to indicate that it
is disabled). Firebug can be enabled all of the time, but you're
probably interested in debugging only a small number of sites that you
visit. Thus, it's useful that by clicking on the Firebug icon&mdash;or by
going to Tools&rarr;Firebug in the Firefox menu&mdash;you can indicate
the sites for which Firebug should be active.
</p><p>
You can add a new site to this list by selecting open Firebug from
that same Tools&rarr;Firebug menu, or by adding it manually with the
allowed sites dialog box from that same Firebug menu. In either
case, the site you currently are visiting will be viewable in Firebug.
</p><p>
Now that we have started Firebug, what can we do with it? Let's
have some fun by going to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> site
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com</a>). Activate Firebug for this site, and
your browser window will be cut in half, with the top half still
showing the Web page and the bottom half containing Firebug. I
generally prefer to work with Firebug in this way, but if you prefer
to keep your browser window separate from your debugging window,
you might want to choose open Firebug in new window, rather than
simply open Firebug.
</p><p>
The main menu for Firebug contains the Firebug icon, which offers most
of the same menu options as the icon in the status line and Tools&rarr;Firebug menu, along with links to the Firebug documentation and home
page. An Inspect button always sits next to that icon, and it lets you
zoom in on a particular item on the page. The rest of
that menu bar changes according to the context in which you are
operating, which is determined by the second row of buttons, marked
Console, HTML, CSS, Script, Dom and Net.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2082580.0x217aa80"></a>
Debugging HTML</h2></div></div><p>
One of the first, and easiest, tasks to take on with Firebug is
debugging HTML. Click on the HTML button and choose
Inspect. You immediately will see the HTML source code for the
current page highlighted in the Firebug window.
</p><p>
Now, here's where the magic begins: with HTML/Inspect selected in
Firebug, move your cursor over the Web page (the upper frame).
As you move the cursor, the HTML element over which it is passing is
highlighted in blue. In the Firebug frame, the HTML source
corresponding to that rendered content also is highlighted.
</p><p>
This functionality is particularly useful when I know
something is going wrong with the rendering of my Web page, but
I'm not quite sure which part of the HTML source is to blame. A few
clicks of the mouse later, and you easily can know which part of the
file you need to edit.
</p><p>
Firebug highlights the HTML source code that it displays, albeit using
different colors than the View Source page that Web developers know
and love. (I think that Firebug's color choices are better.)
Moreover, Firebird displays the HTML source as a tree, including
indentation. This, along with a display of all of the current
element's parent tags (next to the edit button on the top row) provides
a great sense of the current element's context in the document.
</p><p>
Inspecting the HTML certainly is useful and interesting, but it gets
better. If you double-click on the text in the Firebug frame, you
now can edit it. Obviously, your changes do not get saved back to the
server, meaning you can return to the original content by
refreshing the page. Nevertheless, it is quite useful (and fun!) to
replace text on existing pages, right from your browser.
</p><p>
Replacing text in an HTML element is a good start, but what if we
want to modify the markup itself, rather than only its text or
attributes? Right-clicking on the tag (or any of the text within the
tag) displays a pop-up menu, letting you copy the HTML,
innerHTML or XPATH of the selected tag. You can ask for the selected
tag to be displayed in the top frame, scrolling if necessary in order
to reach it.
</p><p>
Finally, you can add new attributes to this element or ask to inspect
the element in the DOM tab. And indeed, the DOM view provides
another way of looking at the same document. While still inspecting
one of the HTML elements, click on the DOM button in the second row
of the Firebug frame. The frame changes its appearance, listing a
large number of DOM attributes associated with the element. Thus,
inspecting an image in the DOM tab shows that its type is IMG, while
inspecting a link shows that it is of type A. As always, Firebug
lets you edit any attribute you like by clicking on the
value and replacing it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2082580.0x217ad98"></a>
Debugging CSS</h2></div></div><p>
So far, we have seen how Firebug can help inspect and modify
HTML. But, of course, HTML provides only the basic content and
structure for a page; if you know what you're doing, you can
inspect and modify the CSS definitions as well.
</p><p>
One of the many amazing and clever things about CSS is the way
it handles inheritance. If you have set some attributes for &lt;p&gt;
in css1.css and others in css2.css, both will apply to &lt;p&gt; tags in
your file. Things can become more complicated than that, such as when you
have a &lt;p&gt; tag with an id attribute, with conflicting style
information. In these cases, the most specific style (that is, the id
tag) applies.
</p><p>
On a large site with many different styles, it sometimes can become
difficult to keep track of which styles are being applied.
Fortunately, Firebug provides some wonderful capabilities for
inspecting the CSS associated with a site, and even for editing
it.
</p><p>
To use this functionality, click on the CSS button (next to the
HTML button we were using earlier), and then on the Inspect button
above it. Firebug continues to show its tree representation of the
current document, but the right-hand frame displays all of the CSS
styles that apply to whatever you're pointing to. Moreover, it
indicates which CSS file, and which line of that file was applied.
And, as if that isn't enough, it crosses out any styles that were
overridden by more specific ones.
</p><p>
As with the HTML inspector, you easily can edit the CSS associated
with any element by double-clicking on a style declaration. For
example, if you want to change text from roman to italic type, you
merely click on CSS/Inspect, then point to the text you want to
change. If there already is a font-style property in the CSS,
you can change it to read italic. If not, you can right-click on
the CSS pane, choose new property, and add the property and its
value.
</p><p>
Firebug knows what the legal property names are for CSS styles, so
it is able to complete the style name automatically when you begin
typing.
</p><p>
The right-hand frame offers more than merely a textual indication of
styles. It also has a graphical representation of the CSS box model,
showing the number of pixels used by the element, padding, border,
margin and offset.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2082580.0x217b108"></a>
Debugging JavaScript</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, we get to the JavaScript debugger. As I mentioned earlier,
JavaScript is becoming a mainstream application
programming language, which means people are writing increasingly
complex programs with it. And, although I've long used print statements
for much of my debugging during the years, there's no doubt that a good,
interactive debugging environment can make it easier to solve certain
issues.
</p><p>
Firebug provides several powerful tools for JavaScript debugging. It introduces a new logging system that makes it possible
to produce debugging output without using the alert function. I
still can't quite believe it took this long for someone to
realize it would be helpful to have a method for logging that
didn't produce a modal dialog box. Regardless of how long it took, we
can now use console.log to write messages to the Firebug console, such
as:</p><pre     class="programlisting">console.log("Now executing the 'foo' function.")</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2082580.0x217b2c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Or:</p><pre     class="programlisting">console.log("Username parameter was '" + username + "'")</pre><p>
Actually, Firebug makes it possible to do much better than this, with
embedded, printf-like strings:</p><pre     class="programlisting">console.log("Username parameter was '%s'", username)</pre><p>
Firebug provides a set of logging functions, each of which
produces output with a different warning level and color. These are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
console.debug
</p></li><li><p>
console.info
</p></li><li><p>
console.warn
</p></li><li><p>
console.error
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The output from these methods appears in the Firebug console, which
you can view by clicking on the Console button, right under the
Firebug icon. Note that using these methods means your methods
might be incompatible with browsers that lack Firebug.
</p><p>
The console is not only an area that receives messages though. As with
Ruby's IRB and Python's interactive mode, Firebug's console allows you
to execute JavaScript within the context of the page. Interested in
getting a list of forms on the page? Simply type:</p><pre     class="programlisting">document.forms</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2082580.0x217b948"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and you will get a list of the forms. You also can use
Prototype-style methods to retrieve information about much of the
page, as in:</p><pre     class="programlisting">$('cvb_form')</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2082580.0x217baa8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which, on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> home page, produces the following form
header:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;form id="cvb_form" action="/" method="get"&gt;
</pre><p>
Firebug also has extensive capabilities for monitoring functions,
setting breakpoints and profiling functions. Go to the Script
button, and you are greeted by the source code for an included
JavaScript file. (You can change the file you're looking at by
choosing from a menu.) Pointing to a line of code with the mouse
cursor brings up information about the current state of those objects.
</p><p>
Clicking on the code allows you to set a breakpoint (including a
conditional breakpoint) to copy the function (useful when trying to
communicate with other programmers or even when writing a column
about programming) or to handle a breakpoint by continuing or
stepping through the code.
</p><p>
To find out which JavaScript functions have been taking the most time,
and which are invoked most frequently, use Firebug's profiler. It's
amazingly simple to use. Click on the Console/Profile button, and
then go about your business, using the Web site as much or as little
as you want. When you click the Profile button again, Firebug
reports the number of times each JavaScript function was called, the
time each call took and where each function is defined.
</p><p>
Finally, the Net button makes it easy to keep track of any Ajax
calls embedded in the page. Clicking on Net and XHR produces a
graphical indication of the Ajax calls that have been made on this
page, as well as how long each took to execute. If you are developing
an Ajax application, this is the best way to find out where your
bottlenecks are.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
It's rare for me to call a product revolutionary, but I am sorely
tempted to do so in the case of Firebug. It puts a lot of information
in one nicely designed, easy-to-use package. The ability to interact
with my packages has a vaguely Lisp-like feel, in that I'm suddenly
interacting with a live environment. Firebug has given me the ability
to &ldquo;see&rdquo; what my pages are doing and to better understand them.
</p><p>
Firebug has become an indispensable tool in my arsenal, alongside the
Web Developer extension. In this way, Firefox is beginning to
demonstrate that it is indeed a platform for Internet applications,
rather than merely a Web browser.
