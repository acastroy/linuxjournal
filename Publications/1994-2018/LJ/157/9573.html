If you've done any Web development at all recently, you've no doubt
heard the buzz going on about Web Services and Ajax. The industry hype
is so prevalent that you'd almost think people were talking about the
next Microsoft operating system. Fortunately, they're not. Web Services
and Ajax are two Web technologies that allow developers to create more
interesting Web applications as well make the development easier and
less error-prone.
</p><p>
Now that I've added to the hype, let me take some time to outline what
we mean when we say &ldquo;Web Services and Ajax&rdquo;.
</p><p>
A Web Service is a program that is accessible over the Internet and
provides a specific service, such as searching a library's
collection or getting bid history from eBay. We're not talking about a
full-fledged application, but rather a Web-based Application Programming
Interface (API) that can can be called over the Internet by a given
program to perform a needed function. Often, the results of the call to
a given Web Service are returned in XML format, which the calling program
can manipulate easily.
</p><p>
When people discuss Web Services, they often mention things like
JSON, REST, SOAP or XML-RPC. These are simply
a few of the protocols available for calling a Web Service. Being
familiar with these protocols lets you make use of some of the
really powerful Web Services being provided by the likes of Amazon,
Google and eBay. However, for my personal Web development, I've found
these protocols to be a bit heavy.
</p><p>
Ajax is a mechanism that allows a Web page to make calls back to the
server without refreshing the page or using hidden frames. For example,
if a user changes the value of a form field, the Web page could tell
the server to make a change to a database, without having to refresh the
Web page, as would be needed in the case of a standard CGI script. From
the user's perspective, the update just happens.
</p><p>
In this article, I outline a set of very primitive Web
Services that perform specific functions on a database. The calls to the
Web Services will be done via Ajax. Essentially, we're going to build a
simple contact management program that stores a person's first name, last
name and phone number. We'll be able to move up and down
through the database, make additions and corrections
and delete records. The neat thing is that
once the page is initially loaded, we won't have to refresh it again,
even when we make changes.
</p><p>
Before we can get started though, we need to have a table in a database
in which to store the information. I happen to use PostgreSQL as my preferred
DBMS. For our simple application, we need only one table (Listing 1).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac8580.0x1bc06b8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Preparing a PostgreSQL Sequence and Table for the
Project</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">create sequence contacts_id_seq;

create table contacts (
   id      integer default nextval('contacts_id_seq') not null,
   first   varchar(20),
   last    varchar(20),
   phone   varchar(20)
);</pre></div><p>
The snippet of SQL in Listing 1 creates a sequence and a table. The table structure is
pretty straightforward for our simple application. The only thing worth
mentioning is the id field. By default, when records are inserted
into our contacts table, the value of the id field is set to the next
number in the contacts_id_seq sequence. The end result is that each of our
contact records has a unique integer number that can be used to locate it.
</p><p>
Now that we have the database table defined, we can start to flesh out the
actual application. Listing 2 shows the HTML for our simple application,
and Figure 1 shows what the application looks like in a Web browser.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac8580.0x1bc0978"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

Figure 1. The No-Frills Web Page for This Sample Application
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, our simple application is just that, simple. I've stripped
it down to the bare necessities to make our discussion easier.
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows how our application allows us to insert a
new contact record or delete the current record by pressing the buttons
at the top. At the bottom of the application, we can move
to the previous or next record in the database. Of course, we have input
fields to hold the first and last name as well as the phone number. We also have a form field to display the record id number. In
a real application, I'd probably make this a hidden field, but for the
sake of instruction, I've left it visible.
</p><p>
Referring back to Listing 1, you can see that the page is fairly
straightforward. Aside from importing the contacts.js JavaScript,
the first part of the page is standard boilerplate. Things get
interesting when we get to the form buttons and fields.
</p><p>
Let's look at the &ldquo;New&rdquo; button:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;input type=button name=new value="New"
    onclick="insert_record();"&gt;
</pre><p>
This button simply calls a JavaScript function called insert_record() any
time a user presses the button. The Delete, Previous and
Next buttons all work similarly. The magic is in the
JavaScript. Let's look at the JavaScript first (Listing 3).

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ac8580.0x1bc1000"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. JavaScript code handles the database actions and data
processing.</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
var req;

function insert_record () {
   send_transaction("/cgi-bin/insert.pl");
   return 1;
}

function select_record (i) {
   send_transaction("/cgi-bin/select.pl?id=" + i);
   return 1;
}

function delete_record (i) {
   send_transaction("/cgi-bin/delete.pl?id=" + i);

   var id = document.getElementById("id");
   select_record(id);
   return;
}

function update_record (i, field, value) {
   send_transaction("/cgi-bin/update.pl?id=" + i +
   "&amp;field=" + field + "&amp;value=" + value);
   return 1;
}

function send_transaction (i) {

   if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {
      req = new XMLHttpRequest();
   } else if (window.ActiveXObject) {
      req = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
   }

   if (req) {
      req.onreadystatechange = process_results;
      req.open("GET", i, true);
      req.send(null);
   }
}

function process_results () {
   var name = "";
   var value = "";
   var fields;
   var i;
   var length;

   if (req.readyState &lt; 4) { return 1; } // transaction
                                         // not done, yet

   var xml = req.responseXML;
   var result = xml.getElementsByTagName("result").item(0);

   fields = result.getElementsByTagName("field");
   length = fields.length;

   for (i=0; i&lt;length; i++) {
      var field = fields[i];

      name = field.getAttribute("name");
      value = field.getAttribute("value");


      var form_field = document.getElementById(name);
      form_field.value = value;
   }

   return 1;
}
</pre></div><p>
The insert_record() JavaScript function, which is called when a
user presses the New button, is the simplest of the JavaScript
functions. All insert_record() does is use the
send_transaction() function to call the insert.pl Web Service. In fact,
the insert_record(), delete_record(), select_record() and update_record()
functions are all wrappers for send_transaction().
</p><p>
The send_transaction() function is where the Ajax comes into our
application. This function takes the URL of the service that needs to be
called as well as any parameters that need to be passed to the service
via HTTP's GET method. Then, the function creates an object that allows
the service to be called. We have to jump through a small hoop, because
Microsoft chose to call this object ActiveXObject while almost every
other browser calls it XMLHttpRequest. Once the object is created,
by whatever name, we tell the object to call our Web Service and then
call our process_results() function when the call has returned its
results. This is done in the line that assigns the function name to the
object's onreadystatechange property.
</p><p>
Well, I lied a little bit. It turns out that the browser will call our
process_results() function up to four times at various stages during
the service request. Each time the function is called, the value of the
readyState property is changed to reflect what phase of the transaction
is occurring. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be much agreement
on when the function is called. The only thing that all browsers seem
to agree on is that when the transaction is complete, the readyState
property is set to 4. Checking for this value is the first thing our
process_results() function does. If the transaction isn't complete,
we simply return quietly.
</p><p>
Once the transaction is complete, we can recover the resulting XML from
the request object's responseXML property. Once we have the XML, we loop
over each field element, making a note of both the field name and
value. Then we find the corresponding field in the HTML document and
assign the new value to it. So by sending the appropriate XML, the Web
Services can arrange for any, or all, of the Web form fields to be updated.
</p><p>
If you think the JavaScript was easy to follow, wait until you see the
Perl scripts that implement the Web Services; they're even easier to
understand and debug.
The insert.pl program is shown in Listing 4.

All this program does is connect to a database, insert an empty record
into the contacts table, retrieve the id of the newly created record
and return the results in a block of XML with a text/xml MIME type. The
resulting XML resembles that shown in Listing 5.

The select.pl service shown in Listing 6 takes a single parameter&mdash;the id number
of the record to be retrieved. The result is an XML file containing all
the fields in the record and the appropriate values. This allows us
to call the function with a record id and retrieve all the fields of
that record for later manipulation.

</p><p>
Granted, our little application is fairly trivial, but it does perform
all of the basic functions that need to be performed on a database:
insert, delete, update and search. More important, no single element
of this application is difficult to write, debug or understand. In
fact, with a few improvements that I outline next, the Web Service
scripts and much of the JavaScript can be reused for other parts of a
larger application or even many different applications. The Web Services
simply become bricks that are glued together with JavaScript to build
applications, and this is what makes using Web Services such an elegant
method of Web development.
</p><p>
From the user's perspective, using Ajax to perform the database functions
is a major win. As mentioned before, once the application is loaded,
users never have to incur the cost of re-downloading it and having their
browsers re-render it. On more complex pages, this can be a significant
delay. Furthermore, because the results of a given operation are returned
in small snippets of XML, the bandwidth requirements are minimal. It's
arguable that not only would users perceive this type of application
as faster, but it also would put lower demands on the server and network
infrastructure that provide the application.
</p><p>
But, how hard would it be to add a new field, perhaps an e-mail address,
to our application? Well, we'd have to add an appropriate field to our
database table scheme. Then, we'd have to add the field, with the same
name, to our HTML document. We could use the other form fields as a
template of course. And, that should just about do it.
</p><p>
So, how could we improve our code? First, we'd need to take
care of some glaring security issues. Our Web Services should use some
form of authentication to make sure that only authorized users can
perform database functions. More subtly though, the Web Services need to
perform some basic validation on the parameters they receive. The
delete.pl service accepts a record number in the form of id=25 as
a parameter. What if someone wanted to be mean and, instead, sent id=25
or 1=1 to our service? Well, our database would be gone because 1=1 is
always true, and our program would delete <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
records. So, we would have
to take care of such issues before we could use these services in
the wild.
</p><p>
You may have noticed that all of the fields in our database are of type
varchar(20). That's not very flexible or efficient. To be truly useful,
our services would need to be able to query the database to determine what
data type a given field was and act appropriately. For example, chars
and varchars need to be quoted, but integers and booleans do not. The
service should be able to determine how to handle these situations.
</p><p>
Finally, by simply sending the name of the table as one of the parameters,
we can build a Web Service that can modify database tables other than
our contacts table. We'd be able to use the same services to update
a shopping list, inventory or calendar. Generalizing our Web Services
like this would make our simple contacts application easy to write as
well as any other application in which we chose to use them.
</p><p>
So, by coupling Ajax with our own brand of Web Services, we're able to
write applications that are more responsive to user input, less taxing
on the server infrastructure, and much easier to write and maintain.
