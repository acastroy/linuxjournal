Configure your server to use your Gmail account.

Most of the time when I start a project, or spin up a virtual server,
it's done in my own basement &ldquo;server farm&rdquo;. Not too many years ago, if
I wanted those services to be public, I'd simply port-forward from my
static IP into my personal machines. Or, perhaps I'd set up a name-based
virtual host as a reverse proxy if I needed to expose a Web app. The nice
thing about hosting projects locally is that when I need to send e-mail messages
(usually error notifications), I simply can send them through my ISP's
SMTP server. Granted, that's gotten a little more complex through the years,
as ISPs are starting to lock down their mail servers and relay
mail only for valid domains, but that just means I have to register
my static IP properly. It works nicely.
</p><p>
The problem is, the issues I've had with my office Internet connection
during the past year really have forced me to reconsider how I host public-facing services. I've been forced, by necessity, to spin up cloud
instances and host my numerous projects remotely. I'm actually rather
thankful for the need, because although it's not free to host projects
remotely, it's fairly inexpensive and much more convenient. I still
have my Raspberry Pi colocated in Austria for free (thanks again, Kyle
Rankin, for pointing me to that awesome service!). Unfortunately, the
Raspberry Pi isn't powerful enough for many of the crazy things I try
on-line. It struggles, for instance, to host MySQL. So my main
&ldquo;project&rdquo;
server is a Google Compute instance that I end up paying about $15/month
to keep active. That's not cheap, but I actually think I might be able
to turn off one of my ESXi machines at home now, and I suspect it uses
more than that in electricity.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2731618"></a>
The Problem</h2></div></div><p>
The problem with Internet-hosted servers is that the lack of a usable
SMTP relay makes e-mail very difficult. Yes, it's possible to install
Postfix as a full-blown e-mail server, but I have no desire to worry
about securing my own e-mail server from attacks attempting to use me
as a SPAM relay. And although installing a non-relaying e-mail server 
certainly is possible, I've found that unless you configure SPF records,
MX records and get particularly lucky, e-mail sent from a cloud instance
often never arrives at the destination. This is especially true if you
spin up servers on the fly.
</p><p>
The truth of the matter is, the only reason I want e-mail in the first
place is so I can get notifications from my servers when something goes
wrong. I don't ever need to reply to the e-mails. I don't really care where
the e-mails come from (address-wise). I just want to have confidence that
my notifications will get to me!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x27317d0"></a>
The Solution</h2></div></div><p>
If you install Postfix on your server, it's possible to use a Gmail
account to send all e-mail on your system. There are a few downsides to
this method, but the configuration is simple, and Google's e-mail servers
are very reliable. Plus, because you're not acting as an e-mail server
yourself, you don't have to worry about having your e-mail rejected by
recipients. It's legitimately coming from gmail.com.
</p><p>
The first unfortunate consequence is that for its simplest implementation,
you need to enable &ldquo;less secure apps&rdquo; to log in to your Gmail account. I
actually set up a separate gmail.com account for my server, and then I don't
worry about the less secure setting. Thankfully, if this is a concern,
it's possible to use two-factor authentication (more on that later).
</p><p>
Second, if you use Gmail as your e-mail relay, every e-mail will be
rewritten to come &ldquo;from&rdquo; the gmail.com address. For me, this is a
non-issue, because I just want my servers to e-mail me reliably when
things go wrong. So although this won't be an issue for many servers,
it's certainly not a feasible way to provide multi-user e-mail on your
server. You can send from multiple users on your Linux system, but every
e-mail that is sent will have its headers rewritten so they come from the
same address! Thankfully, only the &ldquo;from&rdquo; address itself is rewritten,
so messages come from an address formed like &ldquo;User 1
&lt;user@gmail.com&gt;&rdquo; and
&ldquo;User 2 &lt;user@gmail.com&gt;&rdquo;. So even though the underlying addresses
are different, you still can tell from which user the e-mail messages are coming.
This is useful for me, as it helps determine which app is sending me
failure information!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2731b40"></a>
The Procedure</h2></div></div><p>
First, you need to install Postfix along with the tools needed for enabling
SASL connections. Your procedure will vary based on distribution, but
for Ubuntu/Debian folks, it will go something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install postfix mailutils libsasl2-2 
 &#8618;ca-certificates libsasl2-modules
</pre>
</p><p>
When Postfix installs, it will ask what type of system you're
configuring. Multiple options will work, since you're
editing the main file afterward, but I recommend you choose &ldquo;Internet
Site&rdquo; and answer the questions accordingly. (Again, don't worry too
much about what answers you put in the setup dialog, most of it will
get overridden by your modifications anyway.)
</p><p>
Next, edit the main.cf file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, change or add the following stanza of information somewhere in the
file. Pay close attention, because there will be a few lines that look
similar, but are subtly different. You'll probably have to add all the
lines below:

<pre     class="programlisting">
relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/cacert.pem
smtp_use_tls = yes
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you need to create that cacert.pem file. You could just reference the
original file directly, but I like to have all the required files in one
folder&mdash;that makes it easier to replicate when spinning up new servers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo cat /etc/ssl/certs/Thawte_Premium_Server_CA.pem &gt; 
 &#8618;/etc/postfix/cacert.pem
</pre>
</p><p>
In order to send mail, you need to have your authentication
information on the server. Create the file from scratch:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo nano /etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd
</pre>
</p><p>
Enter your Gmail account information. It feels wrong to type a user name
and password into a file, but you're going to lock the file's permissions
pretty tight in the next step. Use this format in the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[smtp.gmail.com]:587 USER@gmail.com:PASSWORD
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >USER</tt> and <tt  >PASSWORD</tt> obviously need to be substituted with your
account credentials. You also can use a Google Hosted Domain account,
just use the full e-mail address instead of @gmail.com. Then secure the
file and create a hash database so Postfix can read it properly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo chmod 400 /etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd
sudo postmap /etc/postfix/sasl/sasl_passwd
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, reload Postfix and test outgoing e-mail:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo service postfix reload
echo "It Worked" | mail -s "Email Test" anotheruser@example.com
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x27322d0"></a>
Troubleshooting</h2></div></div><p>
It's very possible the e-mail will fail. If you get an error like this
in your log files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SASL authentication failed; server smtp.gmail.com[1.2.3.4] 
 &#8618;said: 534-5.7.14 Please log in via your web browser 
 &#8618;and then try again.
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2732430"></a></h2></div></div><p>
the most probable reason is that secure login setting I mentioned
earlier. Like I mentioned previously, I don't have a problem with doing this
on an account I created specifically for relaying e-mail. If you're using
your actual e-mail address though, I don't really recommend it.
</p><p>
If you're still interested in softening the security to
fix this problem, log in to your Gmail account and head to:
<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps" target="_self">https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps</a> (Figure
1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12014f1.large.jpg"><img src="12014f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. It seems odd to &ldquo;turn on&rdquo; insecurity.
</p></div></div><p>
You should be able to switch this to &ldquo;turn on&rdquo;, which turns on the ability
for less secure apps to log in. (That sounds a bit counterintuitive,
turning &ldquo;on&rdquo; a more insecure method, but if you read closely, that's what
you want to do.)
</p><p>
Once you make that change, try sending an e-mail again, and it should
go through. The original e-mail actually probably will go through too,
since Postfix keeps trying to send failed messages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2732958"></a>
If You Prefer More Security</h2></div></div><p>
I've had mixed results using a Google App Password and
two-factor
authentication for Postfix e-mail relay setups. I'll leave this
as an exercise for those folks who don't want to allow less secure
authentication or who already use two-factor authentication on
their accounts. (This might be the only option for Google Hosted Domain
users whose administrators have not enabled the &ldquo;less secure app&rdquo;
feature.)
</p><p>
The first step is to turn on two-factor authentication on your
account. Otherwise, you won't be able to generate App Passwords. Head
over to <a href="http://accounts.google.com/SmsAuthConfig" target="_self">accounts.google.com/SmsAuthConfig</a> in order to enable
and configure two-factor authentication.
</p><p>
Then, create an App Password for your server setup here:
<a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords" target="_self">https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords</a>.
</p><p>
Once you have the App Password, copy it into your Postfix authentication
file in place of the password entered earlier. You'll need to re-create
the password map too using the <tt  >postmap</tt> command. Then restart Postfix,
and try sending an e-mail. If it doesn't work, check your log files
and start troubleshooting there. Like I said, I've had mixed results.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2639580.0x2b2af70"></a>
Not Just Gmail!</h2></div></div><p>
If you are struggling with your Gmail account, or just prefer not to rely
on Google for relaying your information, the good news is this procedure
works for any SMTP server. In fact, the configuration might be far simpler
for other SMTP servers. If you have an e-mail account from your ISP,
you likely can use that account by tweaking the settings above to match
your ISP's account information. I think I have a charter.net e-mail address that
I've never used for anything. I suspect many folks have similar addresses.
</p><p>
E-mail might be a dying form of communication, but for things like server
notifications, it's hard to beat. The problem is, there are so many
security concerns over relaying e-mail, it can be frustratingly
difficult to configure one of the oldest messaging protocols!
</p><p>
Usually when I'm setting up a new server, I quickly install Postfix
and configure it like this using a Chef or Puppet method for quick
and reliable configuration. If you have a simpler or different
method for enabling e-mail on cloud servers, drop me an e-mail at
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>. I love hearing other solutions, and I'll share
any really great solutions with the rest of the class in a future issue!
