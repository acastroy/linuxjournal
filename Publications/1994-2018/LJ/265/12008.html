Reuven describes some of the most interesting features of PostgreSQL 9.5.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126c580.0x13643b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Longtime readers of this column know that although NoSQL databases
certainly have their place, I'm definitely a fan of relational (SQL)
databases. And when choosing a relational database, my hands-down
favorite is PostgreSQL. I've been using it for many years, starting
soon after it was released, and although those early versions of
PostgreSQL were packed with features, there also were significant
limitations in nearly every aspect.
</p><p>
Today, however, PostgreSQL is recognized not just as a sophisticated
database, but as a platform that can be used for storing and
retrieving data, for working with data on many types of remote
systems, and for manipulating and analyzing that data. Just before
sitting down to write this article, I finished teaching a course in
PostgreSQL to a high-tech company&mdash;and throughout the course, even
people who have been working with PostgreSQL for years said, &ldquo;I didn't
know that it could do that too!&rdquo;
</p><p>
PostgreSQL 9.5, which was released earlier this year, might not have
earth-shattering features, but it continues in a long tradition of
carefully managed, rock-solid releases, combining new functionality
with improved performance.
</p><p>
I've recently recommended that my clients start to upgrade to
PostgreSQL 9.5. Along the way, I've been looking into some of the
improvements and additions that were contained in this release. In this
article, I review some of the more interesting ones and describe how
they can be used. At the end of the day, a database is designed to
help you extract useful information easily and quickly; most of these
features fit precisely into that category.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126c580.0x13646c8"></a>
UPSERT</h2></div></div><p>
Perhaps the most talked-about feature in PostgreSQL 9.5 is what's
known as &ldquo;UPSERT&rdquo; in database circles. The basic idea is that
you should
be able to <tt  >INSERT</tt> a new record into a table, but if the new record
would collide with an existing one, then you <tt  >UPDATE</tt>
the existing row instead.
</p><p>
For example, let's assume you have the following table:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (
    id           SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    ssn          TEXT NOT NULL,
    first_name   TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_name    TEXT NOT NULL,

    UNIQUE(ssn)
);
</pre>
</p><p>
The above table assigns the <tt  >id</tt> column to be a primary key, using
PostgreSQL's SERIAL pseudo-type to create a sequence and ensure that it
auto-increments when you don't set it explicitly. But, say you also want to
keep track of people's Social Security Numbers (on the assumption that
everyone in the database is from the United States), which also
are supposed to be unique and, thus, get a <tt  >UNIQUE</tt>
index. Then you have the
person's first and last names.
</p><p>
If you try to <tt  >INSERT</tt> a new person into this table, it should work fine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO People (ssn, first_name, last_name)
    VALUES ('123-456-7890', 'John', 'Smith');
</pre>
</p><p>
If you try to <tt  >INSERT</tt> the same row again, you'll get an error. Even if the
user's SSN is the same, but the name has changed, this won't work.
But of course, that's the whole idea of having the
<tt  >UNIQUE</tt> clause in
the table definition; you want to ensure that no other row can have the
same SSN.
</p><p>
But, there likely will be many cases when you basically want to say to the
database, &ldquo;If this is a new SSN, then insert the new row. But if
someone with this SSN already exists, then update their record to
reflect the new name.&rdquo;
</p><p>
You can do this by modifying the <tt  >INSERT</tt> statement to
include an <tt  >ON
CONFLICT</tt> clause. This clause can work in a few ways. First,
it can indicate that you silently want to ignore such conflicts:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO People (ssn, first_name, last_name)
    VALUES ('123-456-7890', 'Richard', 'Roe')
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
</pre>
</p><p>
The above query basically tells PostgreSQL, &ldquo;Insert this row if you
can. If not, don't worry about it.&rdquo;
</p><p>
A more common action, and the source of the &ldquo;UPSERT&rdquo; term, is to say
&ldquo;ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE&rdquo;, providing an
<tt  >UPDATE</tt>-like statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO People (ssn, first_name, last_name)
    VALUES ('123-456-7890', 'Richard', 'Roe');
ON CONFLICT DO
    UPDATE SET first_name = 'Richard', last_name = 'Roe'
           WHERE ssn = '123-456-7890';
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have assigned a default value to one of the columns in
question, you even can say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SET colname = DEFAULT
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126c580.0x1365220"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and the default value will be inserted.
</p><p>
If you want to set a value based on an existing one, you can do that,
by using the standard TableName.colname syntax.
</p><p>
Note that UPSERT is one of those things that you should think about
very carefully. Do you really want to replace an existing record with
a new one? Or, do you want to enforce the uniqueness and, thus, get an
error if you try to <tt  >INSERT</tt> a new row whose unique values clash with
those already in the database? That's a question that only you can
answer, and it's the reason why you have to add that to your
<tt  >INSERT</tt> statement explicitly.
</p><p>
That said, this functionality, used appropriately, allows you to
shorten your queries and make your logic clearer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126c580.0x13654e0"></a>
Better Grouping</h2></div></div><p>
One of the first things you learn in SQL is to count things. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM People;
</pre>
</p><p>
That'll tell you how many people you have overall. But in most cases,
you want to break that apart, finding out how many people of various
sorts you have. I'm going to create a new People table and
populate it based on a recently released movie:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE People (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    species TEXT NOT NULL,
    gender CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
    side TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO People (name, species, gender, side)
    VALUES ('Luke', 'Human', 'M', 'Good'),
           ('Leia', 'Human', 'F', 'Good'),
           ('Han', 'Human', 'M', 'Good'),
           ('Chewbacca', 'Human', 'M', 'Good'),
           ('Kylo', 'Human', 'M', 'Evil'),
           ('Phasma', 'Human', 'F', 'Evil'),
           ('Rey', 'Human', 'F', 'Good'),
           ('Finn', 'Human', 'M', 'Good'),
           ('R2D2', 'Droid', 'D', 'Good'),
           ('C3P0','Droid', 'D', 'Good'),
           ('BB8', 'Droid', 'D', 'Good')
           ;
</pre>
</p><p>
You can find the gender breakdown pretty easily, by using <tt  >GROUP
BY</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) FROM People GROUP BY gender;
</pre>
</p><p>
But, what if you're interested in finding out the breakdown by several
factors, not just gender? You could issue multiple queries. With
PostgreSQL 9.5, you also can use <tt  >GROUPING SETS</tt>. This
is used with <tt  >GROUP
BY</tt> and lets you pass a list of the columns by which you want to group.
Thus, you can write:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT species, gender, side, COUNT(*)
  FROM People
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (species, gender, side);
</pre>
</p><p>
The result is a table, showing how many humans vs. droids, male
vs. female vs. droid, and good vs. evil are in the movie:

<pre     class="programlisting">
+---------+--------+------+-------+
| species | gender | side | count |
+---------+--------+------+-------+
| Droid   |        |      |     3 |
| Human   |        |      |     8 |
|         |        | Evil |     2 |
|         |        | Good |     9 |
|         | D      |      |     3 |
|         | F      |      |     3 |
|         | M      |      |     5 |
+---------+--------+------+-------+
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to get a count of all records, you can add an empty
set of parentheses to your call to <tt  >GROUPING SETS</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT species, gender, side, COUNT(*)
  FROM People
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (species, gender, side, ());
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you'll get an additional row, indicating how many total rows are in
the table. However, that row will have NULL values in each column,
so if your other columns contain NULL values, you might have some
ambiguity problems.
</p><p>
<tt  >GROUPING SETS</tt> can take multi-layer sets, as well:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT species, gender, side, COUNT(*)
    FROM People
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((species, gender),
                        (species, gender, side));
</pre>
</p><p>
What if you don't want to see the numbers from individual columns, but
combinations? That is, maybe you want to find how many good females
there are or how many male humans. If you're running an on-line advertising
system, you might want to provide your users (&agrave; la Facebook's ad
manager) with the ability to break down advertising by country,
gender, interests or something else. For such cases, now there is the
CUBE facility, which provides all of the possible combinations
for <tt  >GROUPING SETS</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT species, gender, side, COUNT(*)
  FROM People
GROUP BY CUBE (species, gender, side);
</pre>
</p><p>
The result looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
+---------+--------+------+-------+
| species | gender | side | count |
+---------+--------+------+-------+
| Droid   | D      | Good |     3 |
| Droid   | D      |      |     3 |
| Droid   |        |      |     3 |
| Human   | F      | Evil |     1 |
| Human   | F      | Good |     2 |
| Human   | F      |      |     3 |
| Human   | M      | Evil |     1 |
| Human   | M      | Good |     4 |
| Human   | M      |      |     5 |
| Human   |        |      |     8 |
|         |        |      |    11 |
+---------+--------+------+-------+
</pre>
</p><p>
You can think of CUBE as providing all of the permutations of
columns.
</p><p>
A similar type of analysis, known as ROLLUP, also breaks things down
in multiple layers, starting with the full list, then all but the
final one, then all but the final two, until you get down to an empty
list. This is useful when you have a hierarchy&mdash;imagine a salary
table in which each person's location, division and team are
indicated. You then could get total salary (with
<tt  >SUM</tt>) or average
salary (with <tt  >AVG</tt>) across those different layers.
</p><p>
These new options to <tt  >GROUP BY</tt> were added to help people using
PostgreSQL for their data analysis in the ever-growing world of &ldquo;big
data&rdquo; and data science. Some commercial databases have offered this
functionality for some time, and now it has been added to PostgreSQL
as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126c580.0x135c978"></a>
Track Commit Timestamp</h2></div></div><p>
This is a small feature, but one that will be welcome in many
quarters. For years, Ruby on Rails has added
<tt  >created_at</tt> and
<tt  >modified_at</tt> columns to every ActiveRecord model, because it's so
useful to have the timestamp at which a record was either created or
modified. PostgreSQL 9.5 optionally allows you to add this to any
table.
</p><p>
You must activate this feature in the postgresql.conf configuration
file, and if you change its value, you need to restart PostgreSQL in
order to see the effects. When activated, the line will look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
track_commit_timestamp = one
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, when you create a new table and add some rows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Stuff (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    thing TEXT NOT NULL
);


INSERT INTO Stuff (thing) values ('a');
INSERT INTO Stuff (thing) values ('b');
INSERT INTO Stuff (thing) values ('c');
</pre>
</p><p>
A normal <tt  >SELECT</tt> on that table will give the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[local]/reuven=# select * from stuff;
+----+-------+
| id | thing |
+----+-------+
|  1 | a     |
|  2 | b     |
|  3 | c     |
+----+-------+
(3 rows)
</pre>
</p><p>
But, if you use the <tt  >pg_xact_commit_timestamp</tt> function on the normally
hidden <tt  >xmin</tt> column, you can find the timestamp for each row:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[local]/reuven=# SELECT pg_xact_commit_timestamp(xmin), * FROM stuff;
+-------------------------------+----+-------+
|   pg_xact_commit_timestamp    | id | thing |
+-------------------------------+----+-------+
| 2016-03-24 12:07:16.591932+02 |  1 | a     |
| 2016-03-24 12:07:16.592771+02 |  2 | b     |
| 2016-03-24 12:07:16.593563+02 |  3 | c     |
+-------------------------------+----+-------+
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember that the timestamp is held frozen for a transaction. Thus,
if you <tt  >INSERT</tt> several rows at the same time, they'll have the same
timestamp:

<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO Stuff (thing) values ('d'), ('e'), ('f');

[local]/reuven=# SELECT pg_xact_commit_timestamp(xmin), * from  stuff;
+-------------------------------+----+-------+
|   pg_xact_commit_timestamp    | id | thing |
+-------------------------------+----+-------+
| 2016-03-24 12:07:16.591932+02 |  1 | a     |
| 2016-03-24 12:07:16.592771+02 |  2 | b     |
| 2016-03-24 12:07:16.593563+02 |  3 | c     |
| 2016-03-24 12:10:15.647167+02 |  4 | d     |
| 2016-03-24 12:10:15.647167+02 |  5 | e     |
| 2016-03-24 12:10:15.647167+02 |  6 | f     |
+-------------------------------+----+-------+
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126c580.0x135d000"></a>
And Much More</h2></div></div><p>
Those are the features I'll be using the most, but PostgreSQL
9.5 includes a lot more than what I have space to describe here.
Foreign data wrappers, which allow PostgreSQL to talk to other
databases, have gotten much smarter, including the ability to import
foreign schemas. JSON operators have become more sophisticated, making
PostgreSQL into (ironically) one of the fastest and most fully
featured NoSQL databases. New BRIN indexes are a good compromise
between speed, accuracy and size. And of course, there are numerous
performance improvements as well.
</p><p>
And although it's still too early to talk about it seriously, there 
already has been discussion of whether the next version will be called 9.6
or 10.0&mdash;in part because it looks like the next version will include
some truly killer features. About a year from now, we'll be able to
explore those and see just how well they make this amazing database
even more amazing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x126c580.0x135d1b8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
As I have learned to expect, the latest version of PostgreSQL offers a
host of a new features and enhancements that make it not just a
rock-solid database on which to run your operations, but also one
that offers a great deal of flexibility to do so. If you're already
a die-hard PostgreSQL user, you'll probably enjoy these new
features and should plan to upgrade soon. And if not, well, then
maybe you'll take a look at it!
