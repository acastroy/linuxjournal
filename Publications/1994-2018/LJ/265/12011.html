A secure desktop starts with a secure installation.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e57580.0x1f4f3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This is the second in a multipart series on the Qubes operating
system. In my first article, I gave an overall introduction to Qubes and
how it differs from most other desktop Linux distributions, namely in
the way it focuses on compartmentalizing applications within different
VMs to limit what attackers have access to in the event they compromise
a VM. This allows you to use one VM for regular Web browsing, another
for banking and a different one for storing your GPG keys and password
manager. In this article, I follow up with a basic guide on how to
download and install Qubes, along with a general overview of the desktop
and the various default VM types.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e57580.0x1f4f568"></a>
Download and Verify the Qubes ISO</h2></div></div><p>
You can download the latest version of Qubes from
<a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/downloads" target="_self">https://www.qubes-os.org/downloads</a>, and on that page, you will find links
to download the ISO image for the installer as well as more detailed
instructions on how to create a bootable USB disk with the Qubes ISO
(currently the latest 3.1 ISO is larger than will fit on a standard DVD,
so you will need to stick with a USB-based install for that version).
</p><p>
In addition to the ISO, you also should download the signature file
and signing key files via their links on the same download page. The
signature file is a GPG signature using the Qubes team's GPG signing
key. This way, you can verify not only that the ISO wasn't damaged in
transit, but also that someone in between you and the Qubes site didn't
substitute a different ISO. Of course, an attacker that could replace the
ISO also could replace the signing key, so it's important to download
the signing key from different computers on different networks (ideally
some not directly associated with you) and use a tool like sha256sum to
compare the hashes of all the downloaded files. If all the hashes match,
you can be reasonably sure you have the correct signing key, given how
difficult it would be for an attacker to Man-in-the-Middle multiple
computers and networks.
</p><p>
Once you have verified the signing key, you can import it into your GPG
keyring with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg --import qubes-master-signing-key.asc
</pre>
</p><p>
Then you can use gpg to verify the ISO against the signature:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ gpg -v --verify Qubes-R3.1-x86_64.iso.asc Qubes-R3.1-x86_64.iso
gpg: armor header: Version: GnuPG v1
gpg: Signature made Tue 08 Mar 2016 07:40:56 PM PST using RSA 
      &#8618;key ID 03FA5082
gpg: using classic trust model
gpg: Good signature from "Qubes OS Release 3 Signing Key"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs 
               &#8618;to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: C522 61BE 0A82 3221 D94C  A1D1 CB11 
                          &#8618;CA1D 03FA 5082
gpg: binary signature, digest algorithm SHA256
</pre>
</p><p>
What you are looking for in the output is the line that says &ldquo;Good
signature&rdquo; to prove the signature matches. If you see the warning like in
the above output, that's to be expected unless when you added the Qubes
signing key to your keyring, you took the additional step to edit it and
mark it as trusted.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e57580.0x1f4f930"></a>
Install Qubes</h2></div></div><p>
The Qubes installation process is either pretty straightforward and simple
or very difficult depending on your hardware. Due to a combination of
the virtualization and other hardware support Qubes needs, it may not
necessarily run on hardware that previously ran Linux. Qubes provides a
hardware compatibility list on its site so you can get a sense of what
hardware may work, and the Qubes site is starting to create a list of certified
hardware with the Purism Librem 13 laptop as the first laptop officially
certified to run Qubes.
</p><p>
Like most installers, you get the opportunity to partition your disk,
and you either can accept the defaults or take a manual approach. Note
that Qubes defaults to encrypting your disk, so you will need to have a
separate /boot partition at the very least. Once the installer completes,
you will be presented with a configuration wizard where you can choose
a few more advanced options, such as whether to enable the sys-usb USB
VM. This VM gets all of your USB PCI devices and acts as protection
for the rest of the desktop from malicious USB devices. It's still an
experimental option with some advantages and disadvantages that I will
cover in a future column. It's off by default, so if you are unsure, just
leave it unchecked during the install&mdash;you always can create it later.
</p><p>
The install also gives you the option of installing either KDE, XFCE
or both. If you choose both, you can select which desktop environment you
want to use at login as with any other Linux distribution. Given how
cheap disk space is these days, I'd suggest just installing both so you
have options.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e57580.0x1f4fb40"></a>
The Qubes Desktop</h2></div></div><p>
Whether you choose KDE or XFCE as your desktop environment, the general
way that Qubes approaches desktop applications is the same, so instead
of focusing on a particular desktop environment, I'm going to try to
keep my descriptions relatively generic so that they apply to either
KDE or XFCE. 
</p><p>
The first thing you may notice is that instead of
organizing applications into categories, the Qubes application menu is a
list of different classes of VMs. Under each of these VMs is a default
set of applications, but note that it isn't a complete list of available
applications&mdash;that would make the menu too unwieldy. Instead, you choose
which applications you want to make available for each VM by selecting Add
more shortcuts from that VM's submenu (Figure 1). This brings up a window
that allows you to move application shortcuts over to the menu. Note
that Qubes detects only applications that provide a .desktop link (the
same way they automatically would show up in other desktop environments).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12011f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. An Example Qubes Desktop Menu
</p></div></div><p>
Qubes categorizes VMs in the desktop menu into groups based on their VM
type. It's important to understand the purpose of each category, as it
will help you make more secure decisions about what to do (and what not
to do) in each type of VM. Here are the main categories:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Disposable VM:</b></span>
these also are referred to as dispVMs and are designed for one-time
use. When you launch a Disposable VM, it creates a brand-new VM instance
based on a template and launches an application (usually a Web browser
if launched from the menu, but it could be any application available
within the VM's template). When you close that application, all data
for that VM is erased. You can open multiple Disposable VMs at a time,
and each is run within its own container. Disposable VMs are useful for
opening risky e-mail attachments, browsing risky Web pages or any other
activity where the chance of being compromised is high. If
attackers do happen to compromise your Disposable VM, they had better act
fact,
because the entire environment will disappear once you close the window.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Domain VM:</b></span>
these also often are referred to as appVMs, and they're the VMs where most
applications are run and where users spend most of their time. When
you want to segregate activities, you do so by creating different appVMs
and assigning them different trust levels based on a range of colors from
red (untrusted) to orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, grey and black
(ultimately trusted). For instance, you may have a red untrusted appVM
you use for general-purpose Web browsing, another yellow appVM for most
trusted Web browsing that requires a login and still another even more
trusted green appVM that you use just for banking. If you do both personal
activities and work from the same laptop, appVMs provide a great way to
keep work and personal files and activities completely separate.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Service VM:</b></span>
service VMs are split into subcategories of netVMs and proxyVMs, and
they're
VMs that typically run in the background and provide your appVMs with
services (usually network access). For instance, the sys-net netVM is
assigned all of your network PCI devices and is the untrusted VM that
provides the rest with external network access. The sys-firewall proxyVM
connects to sys-net, and other appVMs use it for network access. Because
sys-firewall acts like a proxy, it allows you to create custom firewall
rules for each appVM that connects to it, so you can, for example, create
a banking VM that can access only port 443 on your bank's Web site. The
sys-whonix proxyVM provides you with an integrated Tor router, so any
appVMs you connect to it automatically route their traffic over Tor. You
can configure which Service VM your appVM uses for its network (or if
it has network access at all) through the Qubes VM Manager.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Template VM:</b></span>
Qubes includes a couple different Linux distribution templates from which you
can base the rest of the VMs. Other VMs get their root filesystem
template from a Template VM, and once you shut the appVM off, any changes
you may have made to that root filesystem are erased (only changes in
/rw, /usr/local and /home persist). When you want to install or update
an application, you turn on the corresponding Template VM, perform the
installation or update, then turn it back off. Then the next time you
reboot an appVM based on that template, it will get the new application. A
compromise of a Template VM would mean a compromise of any appVMs based
on that template, so generally speaking, you leave Template VMs off and
turn them on only temporarily to update or install new software. You
even can change which Template VM an appVM is based on after it is set
up. Because only your personal settings persist anyway, think of it like
installing a new Linux distribution but keeping your /home directory
from the previous install.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e57580.0x1f503d8"></a>
Installing Applications</h2></div></div><p>
Installing applications in Qubes is a bit different from a regular desktop
Linux distribution because of the use of Template VMs. Let's say that you
want to install GIMP on your personal appVM. Although you could install the
software directly inside the appVM with yum, dnf or apt-get, depending on
the distribution the appVM uses, that application would last only until
you turn the personal appVM off (and it wouldn't show up in the desktop
menu). To make applications persist, you just identify the Template VM
the appVM is based from, and then in the desktop menu, you can select the
debian-8: Packages or fedora-23: Software option from the menu to start
the VM and launch a GUI application to install new software. Alternatively,
you also can just open a terminal application from the corresponding
template VM and use yum, dnf or apt-get to install the software.
</p><p>
Once you install an application, if it provides a .desktop shortcut and
installs it in the standard places, Qubes automatically will pick it up
and add it to the list of available applications for your appVM. That
doesn't automatically make it visible in the menu though. To add it
to the list of visible applications, you have to select the Add More
Shortcuts option from within that appVMs menu and drag it over to the list
of visible applications. Otherwise, you always can just open a terminal
within the appVM and launch it that way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e57580.0x1f50538"></a>
The Qubes VM Manager</h2></div></div><p>
The Qubes VM Manager provides a nice graphical interface for managing
all of the VMs inside Qubes. The primary window shows a list of
all running VMs, including the CPU, RAM and disk usage, the color you've
assigned them, and the template from which they are based. There is a list of
buttons along the top that let you perform various operations against a
VM you've selected, including creating a new VM or removing an existing
one, powering a VM on or off, changing its settings and toggling the
list to show only running VMs or all of your VMs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12011f2.large.jpg"><img src="12011f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Qubes VM Manager with Some Running VMs
</p></div></div><p>
You can potentially tweak a lot of different settings with a VM,
but the VM manager makes creating new VMs or changing normal settings
relatively simple and organized. Some of the main settings you may
want to tweak include the color to assign the VM, how much RAM
or disk it can have at maximum, what template it uses and to which netVM
it is connected. In addition, you can set up custom firewall rules
for your VM, assign PCI devices to it and configure your application
shortcut menu.
</p><p>
The VM manager is one of the nice points that makes it easier to navigate
around what otherwise would be a pretty complicated system of command-line
commands and configuration files. That, combined with some of the other
Qubes tools like its copy-and-paste method (Ctrl-Shift-c to move from
an appVM's clipboard to the global clipboard, highlight the appVM to
paste into, then Ctrl-Shift-v to move it to that appVM's clipboard) and
its command-line and GUI file manager tools that let you copy files
between appVMs, all make an environment that's much easier to
use than you might expect given the complexity.
</p><p>
Although this article will get you started with Qubes, where things really
get interesting is in how you organize appVMs and divide tasks between
them. In my next article, I will go over some of my own approaches to
compartmentalization both on my personal and work laptops, and I'll highlight
some additional Qubes security features that make it hard for me to go
back to a regular old Linux desktop.
