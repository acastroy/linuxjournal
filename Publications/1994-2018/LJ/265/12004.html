Dave explores the many ways to solve programming
problems in Linux with <tt  >wegrep</tt>.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ab580.0x25a3408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A project I'm involved with has made me think about how there are
always many solution paths for any given problem in the Linux universe. For
this other project, I wanted to cobble together a version of
<tt  >grep</tt> that let
me specify proper regular expressions without having to worry about the
<tt  >-E</tt> flag and get a context for the matches too.
</p><p>
These are both popular expansions to <tt  >grep</tt>, of course: the former
demonstrated by both <tt  >grep -E</tt> and the
<tt  >egrep</tt> shortcut, while the latter task
is done with <tt  >grep -C</tt> and, on some UNIX and Linux
systems, <tt  >wgrep</tt>.
</p><p>
But, there are a lot of different ways to create that particular
functionality that don't involve relying on a modern version of
<tt  >grep</tt>;
older versions might have the <tt  >-E</tt> flag, but don't include
support for contextualization.
</p><p>
So in this article, I thought it would be interesting to look at different ways to
produce what I shall call <tt  >wegrep</tt>, a version of
<tt  >grep</tt> that includes both the
<tt  >-C</tt> contextual window and the
<tt  >-E</tt> regular expression pattern support.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ab580.0x25a3b40"></a>
Wrapper, Maybe We Just Need a Wrapper</h2></div></div><p>
If you have the modern GNU <tt  >grep</tt>, which you can ascertain by simply trying
to use the <tt  >-C</tt> flag, this all becomes easy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -C
grep: option requires an argument -- C
</pre>
</p><p>
There's a pretty gnarly usage statement after this, but if your version
can understand the <tt  >-C</tt> or its wordy sibling
<tt  >-context</tt>, you're in
luck.
</p><p>
Enter a &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo;, a simple script that changes the default
behavior of a program. At its simplest, it actually can be a system alias,
so this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
alias ls="/bin/ls -F"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ab580.0x25a3f60"></a></h2></div></div><p>
is a sort of wrapper, ensuring that whenever I run the
<tt  >ls</tt> command, the
<tt  >-F</tt> flag is specified.
</p><p>
For this smarter version of <tt  >grep</tt>, I simply could tell the user what flags to
use or set specific flags with <tt  >GREP_OPTIONS</tt>, an environment variable, but
let's build out <tt  >wegrep</tt>, as discussed.
</p><p>
For usage, it's going to be as simple as possible: command, pattern,
source file. Like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
wegrep '^Alice' wonderland.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
This would search the file wonderland.txt for the regex
&ldquo;Alice&rdquo;,
rooted to the beginning of a line.
</p><p>
Easily done:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grep=/usr/bin/grep
if [ $# -ne 2 ] ; then
  echo "Usage: wegrep [pattern] filename" ; exit 1
fi
$grep -C2 -n -E "$1" "$2"
</pre>
</p><p>
I even added some error checking to ensure that the user specified the
right number of parameters, with a simple error message to hide some of the
complexity of the real <tt  >grep</tt> command.
</p><p>
For a test file, I'm going to use the first four paragraphs of Lewis
Carrol's immortal <span   class="emphasis"><em>Alice in Wonderland</em></span>, as downloaded from
Project Gutenberg (<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org" target="_self">www.gutenberg.org</a>).
</p><p>
Here's the result of my first invocation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh wegrep '^Alice' wonderland.txt 
11-Down the Rabbit-Hole
12-
13:Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
14-sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once
15-or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was
--
--
26-
27-There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did
28:Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the
29-Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be
30-late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that <tt  >grep</tt> does a good job with this
task, showing me two lines of
context above and below each match, and denoting which line contains the
match itself by having the : separate the line number from the
content.
</p><p>
But what if your version of <tt  >grep</tt> doesn't have support for the -C flag?
What if you actually need to identify which lines match the pattern, then
roll your own context display?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x24ab580.0x25a48a8"></a>
Building Your Own Context</h2></div></div><p>
Since <tt  >grep</tt> is still available, and all but the most
ancient of <tt  >grep</tt>
implementations support the <tt  >-E</tt> flag to allow the user to specify a regular
expression, the task can be broken into two parts: identify which lines
match, then figure out a way to list lines
<tt  >(n-2)..n..(n+2)</tt>, as shown in the
above output.
</p><p>
The first task can be done surprisingly easily because
<tt  >grep</tt> has a handy <tt  >-n</tt>
flag that appends line numbers. With that, getting a list of which lines
match the specified pattern is straightforward.
</p><p>
But, let's see what's output first:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep -n -E '^Alice' wonderland.txt
13:Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
28:Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the
</pre>
</p><p>
Now it's a job for Superman! I mean, um, <tt  >cut</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grep -n -E "$pattern" "$file | \
  cut -d: -f1
13
28
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's switch to the other task of showing a range of lines centered on
the specified line. You could do this with a tortured pairing of
<tt  >head</tt> and
<tt  >tail</tt>, but <tt  >sed</tt> is a much
better tool for the job this time.
</p><p>
In fact, <tt  >sed</tt> makes it easy. Want to grab lines 12, 13 and 14? This'll
do the trick:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sed '12,14p' wonderland.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Well, not quite. The problem is that the default behavior of
<tt  >sed</tt> is to echo
every line it sees in addition to whatever the user specifies, so you'll
end up with every line from wonderland.txt and additionally have lines
12&ndash;14 appear a second time as the statement is matched and executed (the
<tt  >p</tt> suffix means &ldquo;print&rdquo;).
</p><p>
That's why if you're going to do anything with <tt  >sed</tt>, it's
critical to know its <tt  >-n</tt> flag, which surpasses its desire to output every
line it reads. Now here's a working command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sed -n '12,14p' wonderland.txt

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once
</pre>
</p><p>
Can you see how to chain these together? It all can be done in a simple for
loop (particularly if you ignore error checking for now). But again,
there's another small step required: the line count n prior and n
subsequent to the matching line n need to be calculated. That's easy
math:

<pre     class="programlisting">
before=$(( $match - $context ))
after=$(( $match + $context ))
</pre>
</p><p>
Here <tt  >context</tt> specifies whether you want 1, 2, 3 or more lines of
context above and below the matching line.
</p><p>
Let's give this a whirl:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
# wegrep - grep with context and regular expressions
grep=/usr/bin/grep
sed=/usr/bin/sed
if [ $# -ne 2 ] ; then
  echo "Usage: wegrep [pattern] filename" ; exit 1
fi
for match in $($grep -n -E "$1" "$2" | cut -d: -f1)
do
  before=$(( $match - $context ))
  after=$(( $match + $context ))
  $sed -n '${before},${after}p' "$2"
done
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Except it turns out that there are two critical bugs in the above code, as
is immediately apparent when you run your first test:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh wegrep '^Alice' wonderland.txt 

wegrep: line 14: 13:Alice -  : syntax error in expression 
 &#8618;(error token is ":Alice -  ")
</pre>
</p><p>
Can you see the first bug? Line 14 is the calculation for the variable
<tt  >before</tt>.
</p><p>
So what's wrong? You need to initialize <tt  >context</tt> with a
value, so the mathematical expression is essentially:

<pre     class="programlisting">
15 + 
</pre>
</p><p>
Which is correctly flagged as an error. Easily fixed. 
</p><p>
The second bug is more subtle, however, but here's the clue when you run
the script with <tt  >context</tt> defined as 1 near the top of the script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh wegrep '^Alice' wonderland.txt 
sed: 1: "${before},${after}p": unexpected EOF (pending }'s)
sed: 1: "${before},${after}p": unexpected EOF (pending }'s)
</pre>
</p><p>
That's definitely odd. It's <tt  >sed</tt> that's complaining, but
what's wrong with the line that invokes <tt  >sed</tt>?
</p><p>
Let's have another look at that line:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
$sed -n '${before},${after}p' "$2"
</pre>
</p><p>
Now can you see the error? It's a subtle and common problem in shell
scripts: I'm using the wrong quotation marks. Remember, in a shell script,
single quotation marks prevent the interpretation of variables. Switch it to double
quotation marks, and everything now works great:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh wegrep '^Alice' wonderland.txt 

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once
There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did
Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the
Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be
</pre>
</p><p>
Now another problem rears its head: how do you differentiate between blocks
that have matched? Easy, add <tt  >- - - -</tt> before and after each match
by adding a few echo statements to the for loop:

<pre     class="programlisting">
for match in $($grep -n -E "$1" "$2" | cut -d: -f1)
do
  before=$(( $match - $context ))
   after=$(( $match + $context ))
  echo "-----"
  sed -n "${before},${after}p" "$2"
  echo "-----"
done
</pre>
</p><p>
This works, but it's a bit clunky as output goes, although it pretty
closely matches what modern <tt  >grep</tt> does with the
<tt  >-C</tt> flag:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh wegrep '^Alice' wonderland.txt 
-----

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her
sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once
-----
-----
There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did
Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the
Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be
-----
</pre>
</p><p>
As a purist, I'd much rather have one dashed line between output
blocks, one before the first match and one after the last, with no doubling
of lines. 
</p><p>
That's not hard to do, and there's a second task of adding back
line numbers and ideally denoting which line has the match to the regular
expression. But I'm out of room, so those tasks will have to wait until
next month.
