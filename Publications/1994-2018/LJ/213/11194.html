Before saying goodbye, a happy look backward.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x285d2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Six months ago at the end of my last article, &ldquo;DNS Cache Poisoning,
Part II: DNSSEC Validation&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/11029" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/11029</a>), I
mentioned I was going on hiatus. The good news
is, this month I'm back! The sad news is, I don't plan to return to writing
a monthly column. The demands of my day job and family life finally
have overtaken my energy for late-night technical writing, so it's time for
me
to close this chapter of my writing career.
</p><p>
But what a long chapter it's been! Two things have surprised me about this
experience. The first is how quickly the past 11 years have gone! The
other is how long-lived some of these Paranoid Penguin articles have been.
As a technical writer, you really don't expect people to remember tutorials
you wrote six years ago, but I still get e-mail about some of my earliest
pieces.
</p><p>
So, I thought it might be fun to touch on what, for me, have been some of
my favorite Paranoid Penguin articles, topics and interview subjects
through the years.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x285d5c0"></a>
How the Paranoia Started</h2></div></div><p>
My relationship with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> began in the
summer of 2000. Earlier
that year, I'd given two presentations (on DNS security and Postfix) at
Root Fest 2, a hacker convention in Minnesota, and I
thought to myself, now that I've done all the work of researching these
presentations, I wonder whether my favorite magazine would like an article
on either topic?
</p><p>
With that, I wrote to the editors. I was delighted when they accepted my
proposal for &ldquo;Securing DNS and BIND&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4198" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4198</a>). I was relieved when they
liked the
finished article, which for the first and last time I completed a full week
before deadline. But, I was quite surprised when they asked if I could
submit another article for the same issue!
</p><p>
Being both puzzled and worried as to how I could pull that off, I called my
good friend and Root Fest 2 co-presenter Brenno de Winter, and the result
was &ldquo;Using Postfix for Secure SMTP Gateways&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4241" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4241</a>). Thus, thanks to
Brenno, I
made my debut in the October 2000 issue with not one but two articles!
</p><p>
Not long afterward, I half-jokingly suggested &ldquo;Hey, if you guys like
my
stuff <span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> much, why not make me a regular
columnist?&rdquo; Apparently
lacking a snappy rejoinder, the editors simply replied, &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;
The Paranoid
Penguin had been hatched.
</p><p>
Although I didn't plan it this way, I think it's a happy coincidence that I
both ended and began the column with pieces on DNS security. Just as much
now as 11 years ago, the Domain Name Service remains a critical
Internet service with serious security limitations, whose infrastructure
still relies heavily on Linux and other UNIX-like operating
systems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x285db40"></a>
Cavalcade of Tutorials</h2></div></div><p>
After a two-month period of editorial-staff turnover during which the
magazine briefly forgot but then, thankfully, remembered they wanted me to
be a columnist, I began churning out tutorials for implementing all of my
favorite security applications on Linux, including Secure Shell in January
and
February 2001 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4412" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4412</a> and
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4413" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4413</a>), Nmap in May 2001
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4561" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4561</a>), Nessus in June
2001 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4685" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4685</a>), GnuPG in September and
October 2001 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4828" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4828</a> and
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4892" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4892</a>),
and Syslog in December 2001 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5476" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5476</a>).
</p><p>
Although I had been using Linux since 1995, I never called myself an
expert.
Rather, the sensibility I tried to convey was &ldquo;if even I can get this
to
work properly, you can too!&rdquo; This isn't false modesty. Although I
consider myself to be a knowledgeable and experienced network security
architect, the fact is I've never been a full-time Linux system
administrator. For me, Linux always has been a means to an end.
</p><p>
So, if you ever got the sense that any of my articles resembled lab notes
in prose form, that probably wasn't a complete coincidence! I'm not in the
least bit embarrassed by that. A procedure that works is a procedure that
works, no matter who writes it and why, and I've worked
<span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> hard
over the years to produce tutorials that work reliably and verifiably.
</p><p>
(The fact that my readership always has included such an abundance of bona
fide experts and all-around alpha geeks provided palpable incentives for
getting things right! But I must say, as much as I used to worry about
being exposed as a charlatan by some angry sysadmin or another, that day
never came. I've been subject to plenty of criticism and error-correction
during the years, but 99% of it has been constructive and kind, for which
I've been abidingly grateful.)
</p><p>
That first year, I also wrote a couple more-generalized pieces,
&ldquo;Designing
and Using DMZ Networks to Protect Internet Servers&rdquo; (March 2001,
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4415" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/4415</a>) and
&ldquo;Practical Threat Analysis and Risk Management&rdquo; (January
2002, <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5567" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5567</a>). These were
both pieces that involved skills I <span   class="emphasis"><em>had</em></span> exercised
regularly in my
day-to-day work as a security consultant, and they gave (I hope) some
context to the tools I was tutorializing.
</p><p>
This was the pattern I tried to maintain through the subsequent decade:
carefully researched and tested technical tutorials, interspersed now and
then with higher-level security background.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x285e2d0"></a>
Reviews and Interviews</h2></div></div><p>
The higher-level articles consisted of more than just me ranting about
what I think constitutes good security. Sometimes, I let other hackers do
the ranting, in candid interviews: Weld Pond (Chris Wysopal) in the
September
2002 issue (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6126" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6126</a>);
Richard Thieme in December 2004 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7934" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7934</a>); Marcus Meissner in
October 2008 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10183" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10183</a>);
Anthony Lineberry in August 2009 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10505" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10505</a>); and most recently, &ldquo;Ninja G&rdquo;
in March and
April 2011 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10970" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10970</a> and
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10996" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10996</a>).
</p><p>
The Richard Thieme and Ninja G interviews were especially fun for me to
write, because in both cases the entire exercise amounted to replicating in
print exactly the type of private conversations I've enjoyed with Richard
and G through the years at DEF CON and elsewhere. And sure enough, they each
rose to the occasion, displaying in their own ways not only technological
brilliance, but also fascinating opinions and stories about many other
things besides, including Homeland Security, hacking as quest for truth,
ninjutsu and nautical martial arts.
</p><p>
Besides interviewing hacker celebrities, I also wrote a couple product
reviews: BestCrypt in June 2002 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5938" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/5938</a>) and Richard Thieme's book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Islands in
the
Clickstream</em></span> in March 2005 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7935" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7935</a>). You may wonder, why so
few reviews, given what
an
excellent way this is to obtain free products?
</p><p>
First, I can recall <span   class="emphasis"><em>attempting</em></span> at least two other
evaluations: one was of
some WLAN (802.11b) host adaptors that were supposedly Linux-compatible,
and the other was of a miniature embedded computer platform that supposedly
was optimized
for Linux. In both cases, I failed to get the evaluation hardware working
properly. Because &ldquo;it doesn't work&rdquo; falls rather short of the
2,500-word
submission quota I usually had to meet, I chose different topics for those
two months' columns.
</p><p>
Four attempted reviews (two successful) in 11 years isn't a very
high rate, I admit. The other reason I didn't attempt more of them was
philosophical. It seemed that it was more immediately
<span   class="emphasis"><em>useful</em></span>
for me to stick mainly to writing tutorials of popular, free software
tools, than to evaluate commercial products that in many cases were
redundant with such tools.
</p><p>
Which isn't to say I was or am against commercial software. For example, by
covering the free (GPL) version of the Zorp firewall in March and April 
2004 (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7296" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7296</a> and <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7347" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7347</a>), I indirectly gave a minor boost to the commercial Zorp Pro, which (at
that time, at least) was configured in a very similar way. Rather, I chose
to focus mainly on free software, because I <span   class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> and
because it
felt good to support developers to whom I felt I owed something.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x285eb10"></a>
Supposedly Fun Things I Never Did Again</h2></div></div><p>
Some ubiquitous tools, like BIND and iptables, I covered more than once
through the years. With others, I may have written about them only once in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, but revisited them in further depth
when I wrote the book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Building Secure Servers With Linux</em></span> in 2002, and its
second edition,
retitled <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Server Security</em></span> in 2005. (Like many of
my articles, I've
been pleasantly surprised at how much of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Server
Security</em></span> is still
relevant. But the main reason I mention the book here is that it grew
directly out of my Paranoid Penguin columns!)
</p><p>
Other tools, however, I was happy to abandon shortly after figuring out how
to operate them properly. In one case, the tool itself wasn't bad;
the underlying <span   class="emphasis"><em>protocol</em></span>, of which the tool was simply an
implementation,
was and is hopelessly convoluted.
</p><p>
I'm going to indulge myself in a little coyness and not name these tools I
found excuses to abandon. Just because I don't enjoy using something
doesn't mean I'm not grateful to those who donated their time and talent to
develop it.
</p><p>
What I'm really trying to say is that complexity-fatigue is still one of
Linux's biggest ongoing challenges. Even hackers sometimes are overwhelmed
by how complicated it can be to get a single piece of software
running properly under Linux. By
&ldquo;complexity&rdquo;, I don't just mean
&ldquo;requiring the use of a command prompt&rdquo;. On the
contrary, I have an abiding fondness for
applications that pull all their configuration information from a single
text file, rather than scattering settings across multiple files (or
worse, in a binary data file that can be modified only by some GUI tool).
</p><p>
Have you ever noticed that one of the highest forms of praise we give
Linux distributions and applications is &ldquo;it just works&rdquo;? This,
in my opinion, is
a big reason Ubuntu has been so successful. An almost unprecedented
percentage of things in Ubuntu &ldquo;just work&rdquo;. This speaks not
only to
Ubuntu's stability and sensible default settings, but also to how easy it
is to configure it properly.
</p><p>
I don't value simplicity just because I'm mentally lazy (which I totally
admit to being). Complexity is the enemy of security. It makes it harder to
spot configuration errors, it leads to unforeseen dependencies and
interactions, and it incites otherwise-upstanding and industrious system
administrators to take shortcuts they wouldn't ordinarily contemplate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x28559d0"></a>
Recurring Themes</h2></div></div><p>
Which, if you've been reading the column a while, probably is something
you've read here before. Across all these different applications and
technologies I've researched, tested and written about, I've seen a number
of recurring themes and commonalities.
</p><p>
First, the key to securing anything, be it a single application or an
entire operating system, is to disable unnecessary functionality and to
leverage available (and relevant) security capabilities fully.
</p><p>
Second, the worst way to use any Linux tool is to succumb to the notion
that only root can do anything useful. The more things running as root on
your system, the more things an attacker might be able to abuse in a way
that leads to <span   class="emphasis"><em>total</em></span> system compromise. Therefore, it's
important to
run processes under less-privileged accounts or to use SELinux or AppArmor
to curb root's omnipotence.
</p><p>
Third, firewalls are neither dead, irrelevant nor obsolete. With so much
of our network use focused on the browser, and with mainstream firewalls
(including Linux's Netfilter/iptables) having made little progress overall
in gaining application visibility and intelligence, firewalls certainly
are <span   class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> helpful than they were 11 years ago. But this
doesn't mean
we can live without firewalls. It just means we need to find
additional controls (application gateways/proxies, encryption tools and so
forth) to pick up the slack.
</p><p>
Fourth, we're still suffering from a general lack of security controls in
protocols on which the Internet relies. SMTP, DNS and even IP itself were
created long ago, at a time when computer networks were exotic and rare.
Even TLS/SSL, whose sole purpose is to add security to Web transactions,
was designed with a very primitive and limited trust model that has not
stood up very well against man-in-the-middle attacks or against Certificate
Authority breaches.
</p><p>
Securing these old protocols, like securing Linux itself, usually amounts
to implementing new security features (SMTP STARTTLS, DNSSEC and so forth)
that have entered the mainstream only recently.
</p><p>
On a related note, in January 2010, I wrote a column titled
&ldquo;Linux
Security Challenges 2010&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10647" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/10647</a>). I'm both pleased and depressed by how
much of it
still seems relevant, nearly two years later. Suffice it to say that
virtualization, cloud computing, man-in-the-middle attacks against TLS/SSL
and targeted malware have, collectively, made it that much more imperative
to do the hard work of securing our systems and applications, and to find
new ways both to implement &ldquo;least-privilege&rdquo; security models
and to make
it easier to run applications securely.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2765580.0x2855ea0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
So here I am, 11 years after I started, paranoid about nearly all the
same things I was paranoid about when I began, just more so. Am I worried?
Not really. On the contrary, I'm comforted knowing that so many things both
bad and good about how we understand security to work appear to be more or
less constant. This doesn't get us off the hook for keeping current with
new attacks and new technologies. It does, however, mean that what we knew
yesterday will make it easier for us to learn what we need to know
tomorrow, in order to operate securely.
</p><p>
Thank you, Jill Franklin, Carlie Fairchild and my other dear friends at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, and especially to you, my engaged,
inquisitive and
altogether remarkable readers, for accompanying me on this 11-year
journey and for making it possible for me to learn so much in such a
public way. I don't know when I'll be writing about Linux security again,
but I know that it will be here.
</p><p>
I hope that in the meantime, you remain safe!
