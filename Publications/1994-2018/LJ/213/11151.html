How to identify your firmware and 
partition your disk before installing Linux on an EFI computer.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a84580.0x2b7c250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article (December 2011), I described some of the key characteristics of the
Extensible
Firmware Interface (EFI) and its second-generation variant, Unified EFI
(UEFI). To recap, EFI (I use this acronym to refer to either variant
generically) is the replacement for the elderly Basic Input/Output System
(BIOS) firmware that most PCs have used for 30 years. EFI provides a
number of improvements over BIOS, but the most important from a Linux
perspective is that EFI systems boot in a manner very different from 
BIOS systems. This fact necessitates the use of different bootloaders, or
at least different <span   class="emphasis"><em>versions</em></span> of bootloaders&mdash;some are available
for both BIOS and EFI systems.
</p><p>
This article continues the EFI story by describing the preparatory steps you
should take prior to installing Linux on an EFI-based computer.
Specifically, you should know how to identify your firmware and how to
partition your disk. Although most installers set up an EFI bootloader, I
also describe ELILO configuration here. This knowledge may help you
get a recalcitrant installer to boot.
</p><p>
This series continues with two more parts, which cover actual Linux
installation procedures and maintenance of a Linux system that's been
installed in EFI mode, respectively.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a84580.0x2b7c510"></a>
Identifying Your Firmware</h2></div></div><p>
Before proceeding with EFI-specific preparations for installation, you may
want to verify that your firmware is (or is not) EFI-capable. As noted
in Part I, this task isn't always simple, because many computers use EFI, but
don't advertise the fact, and use firmware interfaces that look just like
those on old-style BIOSes. Many manufacturers call their EFI firmwares
&ldquo;BIOSes&rdquo;, and they often ship with BIOS-compatibility modes that enable
them to boot OSes using legacy BIOS bootloaders. (This feature 
sometimes is referred to as the Compatibility Service Module, or CSM.)
</p><p>
Some steps you can take to identify your firmware's capabilities include
the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Check your model: all Intel-based Macs are EFI-based. So are most
(perhaps all) PCs based on Intel's Sandy Bridge CPUs, which began
shipping in quantity in the spring of 2011. AMD-based systems based on
EFI started to become popular in mid-2011. Some models from before 2011
also are EFI-enabled, although they're rarer.
</p></li><li><p>
Check the manual: read your computer or motherboard's manual&mdash;particularly the section on boot options. If there are references to
&ldquo;EFI&rdquo; or &ldquo;UEFI&rdquo; boot modes, those modes enable EFI boot
capabilities. If the firmware includes a &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; boot mode, that
option refers to BIOS boot capabilities, the implication being that the
normal boot mode uses EFI. The lack of any such option
<span   class="emphasis"><em>might</em></span>
mean your firmware is a conventional BIOS; however, some systems
lack any explicit options on this score. You can search for these terms
using a PDF version of the manual, which most manufacturers make
available on their Web sites.
</p></li><li><p>
Check your boot options: even if the manual makes no explicit mention
of EFI, UEFI or legacy boot options, such options may be present in the
boot menu in your computer's firmware setup utility. There also can be a
clue in the form of multiple options to boot a single medium. For
instance, if I insert an optical disc that's bootable in EFI mode into a
computer based on an Intel DG43NB motherboard and then press F10 at boot
time, the boot menu includes two options to boot from my DVD drive. One
is labeled &ldquo;PATA: HP DVD Writer 1040r&rdquo;, and the other is labeled
&ldquo;INTERNAL EFI SHELL: HP DVD Writer 1040r&rdquo;. The first boots the disc in
BIOS mode, and the second boots the disc in EFI mode.
</p></li><li><p>
Check your boot state: you can try booting the computer and then check
the status of the boot mode (I'll describe this in Part III of this
series).
</p></li><li><p>
Check your Windows installation: Windows ties its partition table type
to its firmware type. It installs only to GUID Partition Table (GPT)
disks in UEFI mode and only to Master Boot Record (MBR) disks in BIOS
mode. Thus, if a working Windows installation uses GPT, you can be sure
that your firmware includes UEFI support. If the disk is in MBR mode, you
can be sure your firmware includes BIOS support. Such a system also might 
support UEFI boots, but if you intend to keep booting Windows, it's
probably best to treat it like a BIOS computer.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you've identified your firmware as supporting EFI, you can proceed with
partitioning your disk and preparing for your Linux installation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a84580.0x2b7ccf8"></a>
Partitioning a Disk for EFI</h2></div></div><p>
Most EFI-based computers use the GPT partitioning system. Although it's
possible to boot an EFI-based computer using the older MBR system, such a
configuration is unusual. Most Linux distributions use GPT automatically
when they install in EFI mode; however, it's sometimes easier to install in
BIOS mode and then switch to EFI mode for booting the computer. If you do
so, you may need to pre-partition the disk explicitly using GPT before
installing the OS. You also may want to pre-partition your disk so that you
can set up certain details in the ways you want.
</p><p>
In Linux, you can use either of two families of tools to partition a disk
using GPT:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The libparted family: tools based on libparted support both MBR and
GPT, but MBR is normally the default. To use GPT on a blank disk, you
must tell the tool explicitly to create a GPT disk label. In GNU Parted,
the command to do this on /dev/sda is <tt  >parted /dev/sda mklabel
gpt</tt>.
Using GParted, you should select the Device&rarr;Create Partition Table
menu option, click the Advanced button in the resulting dialog box (Figure
1), select &ldquo;gpt&rdquo; as the partition table type, and click the
Apply button.
</p></li><li><p>
The GPT fdisk family: you can use gdisk, cgdisk or sgdisk to prepare a
GPT disk. These tools use GPT by default, so you don't need to do anything special
to do the job. They're designed to work like the Linux fdisk tools, but
for GPT disks. (Note: I'm the author of the GPT fdisk tools.)
</p></li></ul></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11151f1.large.jpg"><img src="11151f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. You must tell GParted explicitly to use GPT when creating a new partition
table.
</p></div></div><p>
Whatever tool you use, you can partition your disks much as you would using
MBR on a BIOS-based computer, but with a few twists:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
To boot in EFI mode, most EFI-based computers require an EFI System
Partition (ESP). This partition should have a FAT-32 filesystem, which
you may need to create with mkdosfs. I recommend creating a 200 MiB to
300 MiB ESP as the first partition on the disk. To create an ESP using a
libparted-based tool, create a normal FAT-32 partition and then set the
&ldquo;boot flag&rdquo; on this partition. To create an ESP with GPT fdisk, create a
partition and set its type code to 0xEF00.
</p></li><li><p>
To boot in BIOS mode using GRUB 2, it's helpful to have a BIOS Boot
Partition. This partition can be tiny&mdash;as small as 32 KiB, although 1
MiB is a more common size. In a libparted-based tool, you can create a
partition without a filesystem and then set the <tt  >bios_grub
flag</tt> on it.
In GPT fdisk, create a partition and set its type code to 0xEF02. If you
plan to do a pure EFI installation, a BIOS Boot Partition isn't
necessary; however, if you have to fall back to a BIOS-mode installation
followed by a change to EFI mode, a BIOS Boot Partition can be helpful.
Therefore, I recommend you create one.
</p></li><li><p>
Some OSes, such as OS X, like to see gaps of about 128 MiB between their
partitions. Thus, you may want to create your disk with such gaps,
particularly after Hierarchical File System Plus (HFS+) partitions on a
Mac.
</p></li><li><p>
If you're dual-booting between Windows and Linux, you should be aware
that in the past, Linux installations used the Windows filesystem type
code on GPT disks for Linux partitions. This practice resulted in Linux
partitions showing up as unpartitioned Windows disks inside Windows&mdash;a
potentially dangerous situation! Versions of GPT fdisk since 0.7.2 have
provided a new type code (0x8300) to use for Linux partitions to avoid
this problem. This type code will be supported in future versions of
libparted too, and it will be used by default, but this support is not yet
available, as of libparted 3.0.0. You can use GPT fdisk to change the
type code after installing Linux if you want to make Linux partitions
invisible to a dual-booted Windows installation.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
One of the advantages of GPT over MBR is that GPT lacks the distinction
between primary, extended and logical partitions. Instead, GPT supports up
to 128 partitions by default, all of which act like MBR primary partitions.
</p><p>
If you use a libparted-based tool to partition, be aware that what such
tools refer to as a &ldquo;boot flag&rdquo; on GPT disks is actually the type code for
an ESP. You should <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> set this flag on anything but the ESP. This
contrasts with MBR disks, on which the &ldquo;boot flag&rdquo; must sometimes be set on
an OS partition that holds a bootloader.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a84580.0x2b7d8a8"></a>
Configuring ELILO</h2></div></div><p>
Each of the four Linux EFI-capable bootloaders described in Part I of this
series
(ELILO, Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy, GRUB 2 and Linux kernel patches)
requires its own configuration. Describing all of them is beyond the scope
of this series, so I've chosen just one to describe in detail: ELILO. I
selected 
ELILO because it's widely available, easy to configure and
reliable. You may not need to configure ELILO; if your distribution
installs something else and it works, you may as well stick with what it
installs. Even if you need to install ELILO, you may not need to do so
until after you install your distribution. I describe it here because it's
sometimes necessary to install ELILO before installing Linux in order to
get the installer to boot in EFI mode.
</p><p>
You can obtain an ELILO tarball from the main ELILO Web site (see
Resources), or you may be able to use a package that's provided with
your distribution. A distribution-provided package may be hard to use if
you need to install ELILO before installing your distribution though.
</p><p>
You should begin by creating a home for ELILO on your ESP. Several possible
homes exist:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
You can store the binary in the EFI/BOOT directory as bootx64.efi. This
makes ELILO run as the default bootloader if you haven't configured your
EFI to know about any others. If a file of this name already exists
though, be sure to back it up!
</p></li><li><p>
Distributions normally place the elilo.efi file in a subdirectory named
after themselves, such as EFI/BOOT/suse for OpenSUSE.
</p></li><li><p>
If you multiboot with other OSes, you may want to create a directory
called EFI/elilo and store elilo.efi there. This placement, however,
will require that you use the efibootmgr utility or a similar feature in the
EFI's user interface to add ELILO to the EFI's boot manager.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Which approach works best depends on your needs and system. If your ESP
doesn't contain any other bootloaders, the default EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi
filename usually works well. If you can boot your Linux installer in EFI
mode and run efibootmgr, using another name may work.
</p><p>
A complete ELILO installation on the ESP will include at least four files:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
elilo.efi or bootx64.efi: this file is the ELILO binary. You must copy
it to the ESP from the ELILO package. (It's called
elilo-{version}-{arch}.efi inside the main ELILO package file, where
{version} is the version number and {arch} is an architecture code.)
</p></li><li><p>
elilo.conf: this is the ELILO configuration file, which I describe in
more detail shortly.
</p></li><li><p>
A Linux kernel file: ELILO loads the Linux kernel from the ESP, so you
normally place this file in the ELILO directory.
</p></li><li><p>
A Linux initial RAM disk file: ELILO loads this file, like the kernel,
from the ESP.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You can store more than one kernel and initial RAM disk on the ESP if you
want to have a choice of kernels or if you multiboot multiple
distributions, each of which has its own kernel and initial RAM
disk.
</p><p>
The ELILO configuration file's format is similar to that of LILO, the BIOS
bootloader (Listing 1). 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2a84580.0x2f763e8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. A Sample ELILO Configuration File</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#chooser=textmenu

image=vmlinuz-2.6.38-8-generic

        read-only
        root=/dev/seeker/u1104
        append=""
</pre></div><p>
The first few lines of Listing 1 set global ELILO options:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >prompt</tt> tells ELILO to show a prompt at boot time rather than to
boot straight into the default kernel.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >timeout=50</tt> sets the timeout period to 5 seconds. Note that the
timeout period is measured in tenths of a second.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >default=kernel304</tt> sets the default kernel to the one labeled
<tt  >kernel304</tt>. ELILO boots this kernel if the timeout period passes
without a key press from the user.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >chooser=textmenu</tt> sets the user interface style to a menu rather than a
prompt at which you must type an entry. This option seems to be broken
though; it's always produced a blank display for me, although it accepts
key presses as I'd expect. Therefore, I've commented it out by placing a
hash mark (#) at the start of its line.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Listing 1 presents two <span   class="emphasis"><em>stanzas</em></span> following the global options. Each
stanza describes one kernel that ELILO can boot. Each stanza consists of
several lines:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >image=</tt> identifies the Linux kernel file, which normally appears in
the same directory as the elilo.efi file.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >label=</tt> gives the stanza a name. ELILO should display this name in its
menu if you use the <tt  >chooser=textmenu</tt> option, or you
can type this name at
the ELILO prompt when using the default option. The name must
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
contain spaces.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >initrd=</tt> identifies the initial RAM disk file.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >read-only</tt> is a standard part of the configuration.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >root=</tt> identifies the Linux root (/) filesystem. Listing 1 shows a
root filesystem on a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) configuration, but if
you don't use LVM, you'll probably specify a regular device filename,
such as /dev/sda3, or identify a device by UUID, as in
<tt  >root=UUID=c607bd95-8edf-4eb1-aa93-12db8f0e66a2</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >append=</tt> enables you to add arbitrary kernel options. The first stanza
in Listing 1 uses the <tt  >reboot=a,w</tt> option, which works around problems on
some systems that cause the computer to hang when rebooted. Many
distributions use additional options to enable graphical boot displays or
other features. You often can omit such options, but sometimes they're
necessary for proper functioning.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
If you copy the files into EFI/BOOT and rename elilo.efi to bootx64.efi,
you may be able to reboot into ELILO. If you copy the files into another
directory though, you may need to use the efibootmgr program to add ELILO
to the ESP's list of bootloaders. This program will work only if the
computer already is booted in EFI mode. You must type this command on the
computer on which you want to use it; it stores data in the computer's
NVRAM, not on the hard disk. To use it, you would type a command like the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
efibootmgr -c -l \\EFI\\elilo.efi -L ELILO
</pre>
</p><p>
This command adds the EFI/elilo.efi file to the EFI's bootloader list,
using the menu name ELILO. Note that you must use a double backslash (\\)
as a directory separator, and the filename is relative to the ESP. You can
use additional efibootmgr commands to control the order of entries in the
EFI's boot list, to delete items from the list and so on. (Part IV of this
series will describe these options in more detail.)
</p><p>
If you're having problems booting your distribution's installer in EFI
mode, you can set up ELILO on your hard disk, copying the kernel and
initial RAM disk from the installer's disc image to the ESP and creating an
elilo.conf file that references them. I've found such tricks to be very
useful in the past, although as I'll describe in Part III, the latest round of
distributions has greatly improved EFI support, so with any luck, you won't
need to do this.
</p><p>
Once it's properly installed and booted, ELILO presents a simple prompt:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ELILO boot:
</pre>
</p><p>
Press the Enter key to boot the default kernel, press the Tab key to see a
list of options, or type an option name to boot it.
