The advantages of using KeePassX as a secure and easy-to-use password
manager.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185b580.0x1953250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For a long time, my password tracking system was quite simplistic:
hope I remembered the right passwords for each site or record
them in an ordinary word-processor document. Such methods obviously
have great flaws. I might have a hard time remembering a password for an
infrequently used site, and a word-processor document isn't the most
secure place to store passwords. Such a system also tends to promote
either too-simplistic passwords or recycling the same password across
Web sites (both being easier to remember). For these and other reasons,
I decided using a password manager would make my digital life a
lot easier.
</p><p>
A password manager is a program that stores passwords. The stored
passwords usually are encrypted for security purposes. Password managers
can be either desktop-based (the password data stored in an encrypted
database file on a hard drive), portable (similar to the desktop version,
but stored on a smartphone or similar device) or on-line (data stored
in an encrypted form on a trusted third-party Web site). Besides the
increased security (over writing down passwords on a piece of paper or
within an unencrypted text document, or resorting to memory), password
managers also allow for more complex (thus, harder to guess/break)
passwords to be created and stored. After some research, I decided to
use KeePassX as my password manager of choice.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185b580.0x1953460"></a>
General Features</h2></div></div><p>
KeePassX is a multiplatform, open-source password manager. Unlike some
password managers, KeePassX is desktop-based, which has its advantages
and disadvantages. However, KeePassX can be used along with an on-line
storage system, such as Dropbox (I discuss how to do that later in this
article).
</p><p>
KeePassX comes with various features, including the ability to import
and export passwords, search functionality, organize passwords/user names
within predefined categories and a secure password generator. KeePassX
also comes with a limited AutoType feature, or the ability to
enter user name and/or password information automatically on a Web page
from an entry.
</p><p>
Password information is stored in an encrypted 256-bit database file,
which is compatible with other platforms' versions of KeePassX (including
KeePassDroid for Android smartphones, KeePass for Windows and so on). However,
for compatibility, password files created by other versions must be stored
in the older (version 1.x) format that KeePassX uses, versus the current
(at the time of this writing) 2.x version, although work is being done to allow a
future version of KeePassX to use the newer format.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185b580.0x1953670"></a>
Setup and Basic Usage</h2></div></div><p>
KeePassX is available in many repositories; thus, installation should
follow standard procedures for your distro of choice.
</p><p>
Upon initial launch, KeePassX prompts the user to create a
new database. As shown in Figure 1, the Set Master Key box will be
displayed,
asking one (by default) to create a master password for the database.
You should choose a strong master password. An alternate option is
to use a key file instead of or in addition to a password (more on key
file usage later). For most of this article, however,
I use only a master password for my examples.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11146f1.large.jpg"><img src="11146f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Set Master Key Box
</p></div></div><p>
After creating the password, the default main window (Figure 2) appears, displaying (in menus and a toolbar) most
of KeePassX's features. The menus consist of File (importing and
exporting database formats, saving changes to databases and so on); Entries
(adding, deleting and making changes to entries, as well as copying entry
information to the clipboard); Groups (organizing entry information into
various categories); View (toolbar/entry information display settings);
Extras (settings for KeePassX itself, as well as the password generator);
and Help (links to KeePassX's Web site, FAQ list and so on).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11146f2.large.jpg"><img src="11146f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Main KeePassX Window
</p></div></div><p>
By default, two groups are created in a new database: Internet and
Email. To create a new category, choose Groups&rarr;Add New Group, then
enter the name of the new group in the Group Properties window that
appears. You also can choose an icon for the new group from the pop-up
menu. After finishing, select OK. The new category will appear in the
left-hand pane.
</p><p>
To enter a new password and/or user name into KeePassX, select a category
from the left-hand pane for the new password, then either select
Entries&rarr;Add New Entry or choose Add New Entry from the toolbar. A
New Entry window appears (Figure 3), allowing you to
enter password and user name information, along with any other needed
information. Additional information you can enter includes Title (a name for the
entry); Username; Password; Repeat (enter the same password twice for
verification); Comment (to enter comments about the entry); Expires
(set an optional expiration date for the password); Attachment (attach
a file to the entry); and Tools (a pop-up menu). A quality progress bar
also is included under the password section, indicating the password's relative
strength.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11146f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The New Entry Window for Entering New User Names and Passwords
</p></div></div><p>
The Tools pop-up menu contains two options: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
AutoType: Customize sequence&mdash;customize the sequence of password/user name information entered into
forms.
</p></li><li><p>
AutoType: Select target window&mdash;select which application
or browser window to enter password/user name information.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
For extra security, the password can be shown or hidden (displaying
asterisks) by clicking the eye icon next to the password entry boxes.
</p><p>
The password generator is available by clicking
the Gen button within the New Entry window (or from Extras&rarr;Password
Generator). A box as shown in Figure 4 appears. This feature allows
you to create a random, strong password. Three tabs are available within
the generator: Random, Pronounceable and Custom. Under Random, you can
select various
criteria for generating a password, based on types
of characters used, uppercase or lowercase and so on. Under Pronounceable,
some similar options to Random are available, although the selections
here are to generate a password exclusively or near exclusively with
letters. Finally, under Custom, an entry box is shown, allowing you to
type in a word or phrase to define what characters are used to generate a
password. The bottom of the password generator includes several features,
such as setting the length of the password, a password bit strength
indicator and use of an entropy generator. The entropy generator creates
a random set of data (based on keyboard activity or mouse movement)
upon which to base generated passwords.

</p></div></div><p>
The Expire option in the New Entry window allows you to set a date
indicating how long the password should last. This can serve as a reminder
to change passwords regularly for extra security. To view which passwords
already have expired, select Extras&rarr;Show Expired Entries.
</p><p>
To use a stored user name or password,
KeePassX has two options: either copy the information from KeePassX and
paste it into the required entry areas, or select the AutoType feature. To
copy the information, select either Copy Username to Clipboard or Copy
Password to Clipboard from the toolbar, or choose the same-named options
under the Entries menu. For AutoType, select Entries&rarr;Perform AutoType
while the browser is open to the desired login page; the information
will be entered automatically.

</p></div></div><p>
To lock KeePassX from
others' use (such as when you step away from the computer), select
File&rarr;Lock Workspace, or select Lock Workspace from the toolbar. To
unlock KeePassX, select the Unlock button displayed, and enter the
database's master password. For more privacy, an option also exists to
hide passwords and/or user names. Go to View and select Hide Usernames
and/or Hide Passwords. Asterisks will be displayed in place of the user names
and/or passwords.

</p></div></div><p>
If you have multiple databases to manage, KeePassX also offers a bookmark
feature. To bookmark a database file, select File&rarr;Bookmarks, and choose
either Add Bookmark (to bookmark a database file) or Bookmark This
Database (to bookmark the presently open database). The bookmarks 
then will appear under the Bookmarks menu. There's also a Manage Database
option to manage existing bookmarks.
</p><p>
To import or export database files, go to File and select Import from
or Export to. Import formats besides KeePassX include PwManager and
KWallet. Export formats include KeePassX and as a text file.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185b580.0x19547a0"></a>
Advanced Use: Cloud-Based Database File Storage and Smartphone
Access</h2></div></div><p>
One popular advanced use for KeePassX
is to keep a password database stored in an on-line storage medium, such
as Dropbox. Besides serving as a means of database backup, this also
lets you access and update a password file from any number of devices,
including smartphones. This is done using KeePassX's sibling versions
for various smartphone OSes, including the version I use here,
KeePassDroid for Android smartphones. (Instructions should be similar
for those with iOS, Windows or BlackBerry smartphones.)
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11146f7.large.jpg"><img src="11146f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. A Dropbox Directory, Containing a Password Database
</p></div></div><p>
To start, access (or create if you don't have one) your Dropbox
account. Then, move the database file to your Dropbox directory (Figure 7).
Next, open KeePassX and select File&rarr;Open Database (or
Open Database from the toolbar). Select the database file from your
Dropbox folder, and then enter your master password and use KeePassX as usual.
</p><p>
To set up your Android smartphone to access the password database, install
KeePassDroid (and, if not already installed, the Android Dropbox app)
from the Android Market. Next, launch Dropbox, and select the database
file. KeePassDroid then launches and opens the file, displaying
a master password entry box. After entering the master password,
a smartphone-friendly interface showing the various password groups
will be displayed. Functions are available for going to an entered URL,
as well as copying and pasting a user name and password. Entering or
modifying user names and/or passwords also is offered by KeePassDroid,
which will update the database file stored on Dropbox (and, of course,
allow you to access the new information from KeePassX on a desktop).
</p><p>
As shown previously, this allows KeePassX to have some of the functionality
of an on-line password manager, while maintaining the advantages of being
desktop-based. Although I've not tried it, this method should be similar
(available smartphone app permitting) for other cloud-based storage
systems, such as Ubuntu One (which also has an Android app available).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185b580.0x1954bc0"></a>
Encryption</h2></div></div><p>
KeePassX offers two types of 256-bit encryption: AES and Twofish. The
type of encryption used may be changed by accessing File&rarr;Database
Settings. AES is the default, and although Twofish may be used, it's 
compatible only with KeePassX's version 1.x database format. Therefore,
it's probably best to leave this option as the default.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185b580.0x1954cc8"></a>
Key File</h2></div></div><p>
Instead of a master password, a database can be opened using a key
file. A key file is a file that stores data (such as a master password or
random data), and it is stored elsewhere (on the same hard drive, on a USB
drive and so on). One advantage of a key file instead of a master password
is that an actual file is required to open the database. Because the key
file can be stored elsewhere (such as on a separate USB drive), this also
serves as a security option. Another advantage is that a key file may
contain lengthy or complex data. However, one downside is that anyone
who finds the key file can open the database, similar to somebody that
discovers the master password. Also, if the key file is lost (or
damaged, deleted or anything similar) or if any information in the file is changed,
opening the database will be impossible.
</p><p>
For extra security, both a master password and a key file may be required
for accessing a database.
</p><p>
To use a key file, under File&rarr;Change Master Key (or in the Set Master
Key window, if initially creating a database), select the key file
check box. If a desired key file doesn't already exist, select Generate
Key File to create one, then select a name and storage location for the
file. To open the database using a key file, select the check box next to
key file (and the check box next to password too if required), and
click Browse. Browse to wherever the key file is stored, select it,
then select OK to open the database.

Differences between KeePassX and LastPass</h2></div></div><p>
Another popular password manager is LastPass. Unlike KeePassX, LastPass is
proprietary instead of open source, and it relies on a cloud-based solution
(storing encrypted password information on-line). LastPass comes as a
plugin for most browsers and is compatible with Linux. Similar features
to KeePassX include password generation and an ability to fill in login
information for Web sites. However, some advanced features, including
support for smartphones and removing advertising, requires upgrading to
a $12/year &ldquo;premium&rdquo; version. LastPass also requires Internet access
for its full cloud-based use, which might be an issue for some.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185b580.0x1d4d288"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
KeePassX is a very useful and valuable password manager. Its storage
capabilities and strong password generator have helped me greatly improve
my on-line security over my former password-tracking methods. KeePassX's
cross-platform compatibility also provides versatility in conjunction
with its sibling application KeePassDroid. Although there are other good
password managers, KeePassX in particular is worth trying.
