Can a formula quantify whether someone is worth following on Twitter? Dave
tackles this complex subject with a nifty shell script and some math.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b3580.0x19ab358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last article, I started a script that identified user stats for Twitter
accounts, with the intention of being able to analyze those stats and
come up with an engagement or popularity score. Yeah, it's kind of like Klout,
but without the privacy implications or cross-platform sniffing.
</p><p>
The motivation behind creating the script is to have a tool that lets you
quickly differentiate between Twitter users who are spammers or bots and
those who are influencers&mdash;for example, users who have more followers than
people they ostensibly follow.
</p><p>
With surprisingly little work, I created a short script snippet that
extracted basic Twitter figures: followers, following, number of tweets and
the number of Twitter lists that include the Twitter account in question:

<pre     class="programlisting">
stats="$(curl -s $twitterurl/$username | 
 &#8618;grep -E '(stats_count|stat_count)' 
 &#8618;| sed 's/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;/ /g;s/,//g')" 
echo $stats 
</pre>
</p><p>
The problem is, I ran out of space after realizing that some accounts were
presented in one format while others were in another, as shown in these two
differing results: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh tstats.sh gofatherhood
3 0 0 0 Tweets
$ sh tstats.sh filmbuzz
#side .stats a:hover span.stats_count #side .stats a 
 &#8618;span.stats_count 1698 4664 301 13258 Tweets 
</pre>
</p><p>
That's not good, so let's start by fixing it. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b3580.0x19ab720"></a>
Filters Rely on Low-Level Page Format</h2></div></div><p>
The problem, of course, is that my complicated grep sequence
relies on the page being formatted in a very specific manner. If Twitter
changes it even the slightest bit, things might well require updates and
tweaks. Next time, we'll just get a supercomputer and some AI. For now
though, I'll make the&mdash;rash&mdash;assumption that I've found
both possible output formats between @FilmBuzz and my new @GoFatherhood
Twitter accounts (the former tied to my film blog, <a href="http://www.DaveOnFilm.com" target="_self">www.DaveOnFilm.com</a>, and
the latter tied to my new dad blog <a href="http://www.GoFatherhood.com" target="_self">www.GoFatherhood.com</a>, in case you're
curious).
</p><p>
To normalize the output, I simply can filter out the &ldquo;.stats&rdquo; line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
twitterurl="http://twitter.com"   # no trailing slash 
if [ $# -ne 1 ] ; then
  echo "Usage: $0 TWITTERID"
  exit 1
fi 
username="$1" 
 stats="$(curl -s $twitterurl/$username | grep -E
 &#8618;'(stats_count|stat_count)' |
      sed 's/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;/ /g;s/,//g' | grep -v '.stats')" 
echo $stats
</pre>
</p><p>
The result is exactly as desired now: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh tstats.sh filmbuzz
1698 4664 301 13259 Tweets 
</pre>
</p><p>
The next logical step is to identify each of those fields, so we can do some
basic calculations and screening. 
</p><p>
With a set of numbers separated by spaces, there are a couple ways to
pull them into variables, but my favorite is to use sed to
turn the set of values into a name=value sequence, as illustrated in this
simple example: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
eval $(echo 1 2 3 | sed 's/^/a=/;s/ /;b=/;s/ /;c') 
</pre>
</p><p>
The intermediate output of this is <tt  >a=1;b=2;c=3</tt>, and when it's evaluated
by the shell (the <tt  >eval</tt> and the
<tt  >$()</tt> subshell working together), the
result is that there are now three new variables in the shell, a, b and c,
with the values 1, 2 and 3, respectively: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo b = $b
b = 2 
</pre>
</p><p>
To apply this in our Twitter script, I'll just make the smallest
tweaks: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
eval $(echo $stats | cut -d\  -f1-4 | 
 &#8618;sed 's/^/fwing=/;s/ /;fwers=/;s/ 
 &#8618;/;lists=/;s/ /;tweets=/') 
echo "$1 has sent $tweets tweets and follows $fwing, 
has $fwers followers and is on $lists lists." 
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that I had to add a <tt  >cut</tt> invocation to get rid of the
word &ldquo;Tweets&rdquo; (see the earlier script output) to ensure that
<tt  >eval</tt>
doesn't get confused with its variable assignments. 
The result is nice: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
filmbuzz has sent 13259 tweets and follows 1698, 
has 4664 followers and is on 301 lists. 
Trying a different user? 
davetaylor has sent 30282 tweets and follows 567, 
has 10284 followers and is on 791 lists.
</pre>
</p><p>
Good. Now let's talk numbers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b3580.0x19ac0c0"></a>
Lightweight Numbers, Lightweight Results</h2></div></div><p>
Before I proceed, yes, I realize that the only outcome we can have from
trying to analyze these most basic of stats is going to be a very
simplistic score of whether someone is &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; or has any
authority in the Twitterverse. Useful additional stats would be how many
times they're re-tweeted (others rebroadcast their messages), what
percentage of their tweets include a URL (which can indicate whether
they're simply disseminating Web content or actually participating on
Twitter) and what percentage of their tweets reference another Twitter
account or, ideally, are actually replies to other Twitter users. 
</p><p>
We could calculate some of these figures by pulling the 100 most-recent
tweets from an account and quickly scanning for the @ symbol, an
http: sequence and so forth, but I'll leave that as an exercise for
you, the reader, and look forward to someone submitting the improved code
to our archives at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>.
</p><p>
For now, I'm going to posit that an interesting tweet value can be
calculated like this: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
(followers / following) * (lists/1000) * (tweets/1000) 
</pre>
</p><p>
It's not perfect. Indeed, my friend F. Andy Seidl points out that
100/10 isn't necessarily only half as influential as 200/10 and
suggests we use logarithms, but let's work with this basic calculation
first and see what we get. 
</p><p>
For my @DaveTaylor account, here's the base math: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
(10284 / 567) * (793/1000) * (30285/1000) 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b3580.0x19ac538"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which solves down to 434. By comparison, @FilmBuzz with a much closer ratio
of followers to following solves down to the value 11, and the brand-new,
zero value @GoFatherhood solves&mdash;unsurprisingly&mdash;to zero. 
</p><p>
Robert Scoble of Rackspace is an interesting case to examine here. His
stats: scobleizer has sent 56,157 tweets and follows 32,527, has 21,6782
followers and is on 19,134 lists. Impressive. His score? 7,161.
</p><p>
One more example before we implement the formula: @linuxjournal has sent
3,208 tweets and follows 5,050, has 12,050 followers and is on 1,165 lists.
Score: 9. 
</p><p>
Suffice it to say, it's a weak analysis system. Still, it's at least
something to explore and, as I suggested earlier, there are lots of ways to
refine and improve the formula once you can extract individual data
points easily from the Twitter stream. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x18b3580.0x19ac748"></a>
Coding the Score</h2></div></div><p>
Math is most commonly implemented using the bc program, and since
we have nicely named variables, it's a breeze to implement in the
script: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "scale=2;($fwers / $fwing) * ($lists/1000) * ($tweets/1000)" | bc
</pre>
</p><p>
Fully implementing it with some friendly output involves a slight tweak of
the earlier <tt  >echo</tt> statement coupled with the use of the /bin/echo
version of the command that knows the <tt  >-n</tt> (no line break at the
end) version. You'll see why: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
/bin/echo -n "$1: $tweets tweets sent, follows $fwing, has $fwers
 &#8618;followers, is on $lists lists. SCORE: " 

echo "scale=2;($fwers / $fwing) * ($lists/1000) * ($tweets/1000)" | bc
</pre>
</p><p>
With this in hand, a few quick test calculations: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ sh tstats.sh davetaylor

davetaylor: 30285 tweets sent, follows 567, has 10283 followers, 
is on 793 lists. SCORE: 433.60

$ sh tstats.sh linuxjournal

linuxjournal: 3208 tweets sent, follows 5050, has 12050 followers, 
is on 1165 lists. SCORE: 8.83

$ sh tstats.sh arrington

arrington: 9163 tweets sent, follows 1852, has 100477 followers, 
is on 7729 lists. SCORE: 3836.29 
</pre>
</p><p>
It's not unreasonable that Mike Arrington, with 100,477 followers against the
1,852 that he follows should have a high Twitter influence score, while
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, with its 12,050 followers against the
5,050 it's following
is ostensibly less popular or influential.
</p><p>
Anyway, I've run out of space here. I hope this has been interesting,
and I highly encourage you to push on this idea and see both what additional
numbers you can glean from Twitter and how they can all be combined into a
single numeric score that could offer up a Twitter score.
