Want your users to be able to log in via Facebook, Twitter or
Google+? OAuth is the answer!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba0580.0xc98300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Like many software developers (and people in general), I'm something of a
hypocrite. When I'm working with clients, I tell them how important
it is to have secure passwords, how they should use a different
password on every site, and how they should force their users to have
secure passwords as well. And although I often do use different
passwords for different sites and try to change them on a
semi-regular basis, the fact is that I can remember only so many
different ones and end up reusing a number of them in different
variations and at different times. Better (or worse) yet, I don't
need to remember these passwords, because my browser can and often
will do it for me.
</p><p>
Now, this clearly is a problem, because it means if others
crack one of my reused passwords, they might (depending on the
password in question) be able to access a number of other systems
around the world, from sites where I shop to servers I help 
operate.
</p><p>
Passwords have other problems associated with them as well. When you
register with a Web site, how do you know that you can trust the site
with your identity? Do you really want to create another account?
You've already registered with many different sites through the years.
Why not just use one of those logins to authenticate your session at
another site? (Of course, you could argue that there's no reason to
trust certain sites, such as Facebook, but that's another discussion entirely.)
</p><p>
This idea, that you shouldn't need to register with new sites
and instead should be able use your existing registration information from other
sites, has gained popularity in the last few years. A protocol known
as OAuth makes it possible to put this into effect, letting any site
be a &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; (that is, use another site's authentication credentials)
or a &ldquo;provider&rdquo; (that is, make its user-registration information
available to other applications). This means that although people 
normally might use OAuth to log in via Twitter or Facebook, there's no reason
why your own applications could not be providers as well. OAuth
itself is silent on this matter, allowing each consumer application to
decide which providers it will and won't allow.
</p><p>
This column focuses on Web applications, so I'm not going to
discuss the OAuth protocol itself. For that, I suggest reading the
appropriately named &ldquo;A Primer to the OAuth Protocol&rdquo; by Adrian
Hannah in the June 2011 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> (see Resources).
</p><p>
A number of alternatives have been proposed through the years, but none
of them really have taken off. One of the more intriguing
suggestions, OpenID, is something I covered several years ago in
this column, and I'd still like to see it succeed, but as a
speaker mentioned at a conference I recently attended, OpenID was
neither clear nor appealing to anyone outside the 
software development community.
</p><p>
This article shows how to include OAuth in your own
applications. OAuth is platform-neutral, meaning you can use it
from any language you like. As regular readers of this column
know, I'm a big fan of the Ruby language and the Ruby on Rails
framework for Web development, so I demonstrate OAuth in
that way here. Implementations for many other languages and
frameworks exist as well, so if you're not a Ruby developer,
consider looking for the appropriate library for your favorite
language.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba0580.0xc98880"></a>
OAuth Basics</h2></div></div><p>
As I mentioned previously, I'm not going to describe the OAuth protocol in
detail. Rather, I want to describe how it works from the perspective
of a Web application.
</p><p>
First and foremost, you need to decide which providers you are
interested in using and then register with each of them. Different
applications will want to use different providers. For example,
GitHub, a commercial service that hosts Git repositories, supports
OAuth. If your users are likely to have GitHub accounts, it
might be worthwhile to have it as a provider. But, if you're
creating a consumer shopping application, the odds are pretty
good that most of your users won't have GitHub accounts. Thus, you
also should consider another provider, such as Facebook or Twitter.
</p><p>
Registering with a provider gives you a unique ID and a secret,
which you can think of as a user name and password for your
application. These will allow your application to connect to the
provider.
</p><p>
When users want to authenticate to your non-OAuth site, they
typically have to enter a user name and password. But if your system
uses OAuth, the user name and password (or any other system)
is handled by the provider, rather than by the consumer (that is, your
application). So long as the provider agrees that you're who you say
you are, your application will accept that claim.
</p><p>
The authentication process begins when users indicate they
want to log in via a third-party provider. Users are redirected to
a URL on the provider's site, where users are asked to authenticate.
In some cases, this can happen in one step, passing the application's
ID; in other cases, it requires two HTTP transactions: one
to get a request token and a second to perform the actual
authentication. Regardless, the result of authentication is an HTTP
request from the provider to your application. That request will
include several additional parameters, including a code generated by
the provider.
</p><p>
Finally, your application must make a call to the provider, combining
everything you have used so far&mdash;the application's unique ID
for this provider, the secret and the code you got from the
provider after the user's authentication. If all goes well, the
server will respond by requesting your URL again, indicating (via
passed parameters) that you have authenticated this user.
</p><p>
Actually, one additional piece of information is handed
to the OAuth provider, namely the &ldquo;scope&rdquo;, which you can think of as a
set of permissions. Many providers offer different amounts of
information about a person. For example, Facebook could provide you
with my name and e-mail address, information about my friends or even
the ability to read my chat and inbox messages.
</p><p>
Not all users will want to allow your application the full set of
Facebook permissions. A good general rule of thumb is that you should
ask for the minimum set of permissions from the provider that will
allow your application to work. If your application works on your
Facebook inbox, it obviously will need permission to work with
the inbox. If not, there's no reason to grant it such permission.
The permissions you request in the &ldquo;scope&rdquo; parameter will be
displayed to the user as part of the authentication dialog, such that
he or she will not be surprised by the degree to which the consumer
application can access private data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba0580.0xc98cf8"></a>
Setting Up Devise</h2></div></div><p>
If the above flow seems a bit complicated, that's because it is.
Instead of a simple HTML form that is submitted to a controller on your
own server, you're now having a conversation with a remote server that
requires three or four different HTTP transactions, each with its own set of
parameters. But, it's pretty clear to me that for all of its
complexity and added overhead, OAuth is a good way to go for many Web
sites.
</p><p>
Fortunately, as is often the case with open-source software and
network standards, freely available libraries make the
integration of such functionality fairly easy. For example, let's
assume I want to create a &ldquo;hello, world&rdquo; application. Anonymous
users get a plain-old &ldquo;hello, world&rdquo;, but registered users get a
premium version of &ldquo;hello, world&rdquo;, so there's a big incentive for
people to register and sign in.
</p><p>
I have been using the devise library for user registration and
authentication for some time now, and I've found it to be quite easy
to use as well as flexible. I'm not the only one who has found it to
be flexible though. A large number of plugin modules are available
for devise, making it possible to change the way 
authentication is done. One of these plugins is called (somewhat
confusingly) OmniAuth, which makes it possible to authenticate against a
variety of sites and protocols, including OAuth.
</p><p>
At the shell prompt, I first created three databases in PostgreSQL:

<pre     class="programlisting">
createdb helloworld_development
createdb helloworld_test
createdb helloworld_production
</pre>
</p><p>
I then created a simple application using PostgreSQL:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails new helloworld -d postgresql
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, I modified the Gemfile such that it would use devise, by adding
the following line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem 'devise'
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, I invoked:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bundle install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba0580.0xc99278"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to ensure that the Ruby gem was installed in my application. Next, I 
installed devise into my application:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails g devise:install
</pre>
</p><p>
With that in place, I created a new &ldquo;user&rdquo; model, using the generator
that comes with devise:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails g devise user
</pre>
</p><p>
I then created a new route, so that I can get to the home controller:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root :to =&gt; 'home#index'
</pre>
</p><p>
Realizing I didn't yet have a home controller, I then added it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails g controller home
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, I removed public/index.html to ensure that it doesn't take over
from my application.
</p><p>
Then, I made a slight change to the database configuration file
(config/database.yml). I created the database as the &ldquo;reuven&rdquo; user,
which doesn't require a password on my local machine, but Rails
(reasonably) assumes that I want to have a unique database user for
this application. So I modified config/database.yml, such that the
&ldquo;user name&rdquo; provided was changed to &ldquo;reuven&rdquo;. I was able to test that
database access worked correctly by using the shortcut to enter the
psql database client:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rails db -p
</pre>
</p><p>
With all of that in place, I ran the migrations:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bundle exec rake db:migrate
</pre>
</p><p>
That created my user model in the database.
</p><p>
Next, I modified app/views/hello/index.html.erb, such that it gives a
quick &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; response to anyone who invokes it and added the following
route in config/routes.rb:

<pre     class="programlisting">
match '/hello' =&gt; 'hello#index'
</pre>
</p><p>
I realize that this seems like an awfully long set of steps just so
you can play with OAuth. But if you've been doing Rails
development for any length of time, this shouldn't faze you too
much, as much of it becomes second nature.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba0580.0xc99ab8"></a>
Adding Authentication</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I have a basic working application, I'm going to force people to
log in. Because I'm using devise, I can add a before filter to any
controller that forces users to log in if they haven't done so
already. I just add the following inside the controller's classes 
for people to be signed in:

<pre     class="programlisting">
before_filter :authenticate_user!
</pre>
</p><p>
I put this line at the beginning of the class definition of
HelloController. And sure enough, the next time I went to / on my
server, I got a registration form.
</p><p>
So far, so good, but say you don't want to have a devise registration
form. Rather, you want people to sign in via a third-party application.
For now, let's say you want people to log in via Facebook. How do
you accomplish that?
</p><p>
Well, the first thing you need to do is ensure that you're on a
&ldquo;real&rdquo;
URL, on a publicly available server. It's nice to develop on your own
local computer, using NAT and a router, but remember that OAuth
requires that the server will send a message to use via HTTP. If your
server is unreachable from the outside world, this will be a problem.
</p><p>
The second thing is that you need to register with Facebook in order
for this to work. Facebook registration means creating a new
application, just as if you were building an application on the Facebook
platform itself. I went to https://developers.facebook.com/apps,
clicked on create new app and entered &ldquo;helloworld&rdquo; for the app name
and &ldquo;atfhelloworld&rdquo; as the namespace. A few moments later, I was
looking at the page for my brand-new application, with both an ID and
a secret.
</p><p>
I then went to the text field labeled, &ldquo;I want to allow people to log
in through Facebook&rdquo;, and entered the public URL for my application,
which I intend to set up: http://www.lerner.co.il:2222/.
</p><p>
Now that Facebook knows where it can and should go, you need to
make some configuration changes on your server. After all, while you're
using devise, you haven't configured OAuth at all.
</p><p>
The first thing you need to do is tell your Rails application to load
the gems that will be necessary for Omniauth, OAuth and OAuth's
connection to Facebook, by putting the following in your Gemfile:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gem "oa-oauth", :require =&gt; "omniauth/oauth"
gem 'omniauth-facebook'
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that you need the :require parameter, because the name of the gem
isn't identical to the location of the file that defines the library
of the same name.
</p><p>
Next, open up your User model (app/models/user.rb), and add
:omniauthable to the long list of descriptions that you give your user
model. By default, the list looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
       :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable
</pre>
</p><p>
But, after you're done, it looks like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable,
       :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :validatable,
       :omniauthable
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, tell Omniauth your ID and secret for connecting to Facebook,
putting them in the devise configuration file,
config/initializers/devise.rb. Omniauth is a separate gem, but you're
using it within devise, so the configuration goes into that file.
Omniauth actually is a common and popular gem to use with devise,
which is why the following comments are placed inside this
configuration file by default:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# ==&gt; OmniAuth
# Add a new OmniAuth provider. Check the wiki 
# for more information on setting
# up on your models and hooks.
# config.omniauth :github, 'APP_ID', 'APP_SECRET', :scope =&gt;
# 'user,public_repo'
</pre>
</p><p>
I added a line here for Facebook:


<pre     class="programlisting">
config.omniauth :facebook, '149179328516589',
    'XXXXXX59862dede3791430ffXXXXXXXX',
    :scope =&gt; 'user_about_me,user_education_history,read_friendlists'
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice how the scope is Facebook-dependent; each provider can set its
own list of scopes, according to what information it has to offer.
</p><p>
Finally, you need to modify your application such that when the user
wants to log in, you go to Facebook, rather than to the default
registration and login forms. For this to work, you need at least
one page without authentication enabled. (As a general rule, you
don't want to authenticate every page on a system&mdash;after all, users
should be able to see the home page without logging in, right?)
</p><p>
Thus, I changed the before_filter in HelloController to read:

<pre     class="programlisting">
before_filter :authenticate_user!, :except =&gt; :index
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, users need to be authenticated except for your home
(default) page, index. I also added a new route to config/routes.rb:

<pre     class="programlisting">
match '/goodbye' =&gt; 'hello#goodbye'
</pre>
</p><p>
This means that your &ldquo;hello&rdquo; controller responds to a second action,
named &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo;. And, according to the rules you have
established, users who want to see &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; need to log in.
Sure enough, after putting in these changes, going to /hello results
in a &ldquo;hello!&rdquo; being displayed, without any need to register or log in.
But, going to /goodbye redirects you to the devise login form.
</p><p>
Now that users can come to your home page without being logged in, you
can provide them with the option to log in, either using your regular
registration system or via Facebook. The easiest way I've found to do
this is to modify the default layout for the application, in
app/views/layouts/application.html.erb. I added the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;%= link_to "Sign up", new_user_registration_path %&gt; &amp;bull;
&lt;%= link_to "Sign in", new_user_session_path %&gt; &amp;bull;
or &lt;%= link_to "Sign in with Facebook",
user_omniauth_authorize_path(:facebook) %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, users now can sign up (register)
with your local registration system or log in directly using their
Facebook accounts. The
<tt  >user_omniauth_authorize_path(:facebook)</tt> helper
was created automatically by devise when you defined your model as
<tt  >:omniauthable</tt>. This is why, by the way, you can have
only a single
model defined as <tt  >:omniauthable</tt> in devise. It normally isn't an
issue, although I have seen systems in which there were two different
login schemes, one for regular users and one for administrators.
</p><p>
If the user decides to log in as usual, nothing changes. But if
the user clicks on &ldquo;sign in with Facebook&rdquo;, the whole OAuth system
kicks into gear, which means that if you're testing your software
on a computer or server that's not identical to what you told
Facebook, you'll receive an error indicating that the redirection URL
didn't work correctly.
</p><p>
When I clicked on the &ldquo;sign in with Facebook&rdquo; link, my browser was
redirected to a Facebook page which told me, very simply, that the
&ldquo;helloworld&rdquo; application would like to get information about me and
about my education. This reflected at least part of the scope that I
had defined back in devise.rb:


<pre     class="programlisting">
:scope =&gt; 'user_about_me,user_education_history,read_friendlists'
</pre>
</p><p>
But, what about reading my list of friends? Did Facebook somehow
forget? Not exactly. After signing in on that initial page, Facebook
then gave me a new page, indicating that:

<pre     class="programlisting">
To enhance your experience, helloworld would also like permission
to:

Access my custom friend lists
</pre>
</p><p>
I clicked on the &ldquo;Allow&rdquo; button, and all seemed to be going well,
until I got an error message in my browser:

<pre     class="programlisting">
The action 'facebook' could not be found for
Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
</pre>
</p><p>
This is because I still need to do two things. First, I need
to update my route, such that the Facebook callback will be handled
by devise. I can do this by modifying config/routes.rb, such that
the original route:

<pre     class="programlisting">
devise_for :user
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba0580.0x1093258"></a></h2></div></div><p>
is replaced by:

<pre     class="programlisting">
devise_for :user, :controllers =&gt; {
  :omniauth_callbacks =&gt; "users/omniauth_callbacks"
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This means that when Omniauth is invoked for a callback, I want the
users/omniauth_callbacks controller to take care of this. The second
thing I must do is define this controller, by putting
omniauth_callbacks.rb inside of app/controllers/users, a subdirectory
that I must create. I took the definition of this controller
straight from the devise documentation:


<pre     class="programlisting">
class Users::OmniauthCallbacksController &lt;
 &#8618;Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
  def facebook
    @user = User.find_for_facebook_oauth(env["omniauth.auth"],
    &#8618;current_user)

    if @user.persisted?
      flash[:notice] = I18n.t "devise.omniauth_callbacks.success", 
      &#8618;:kind =&gt; "Facebook"
      sign_in_and_redirect @user, :event =&gt; :authentication
    else
      session["devise.facebook_data"] = env["omniauth.auth"]
      redirect_to new_user_registration_url
    end
  end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, I want to find a user in my database based on the
Facebook OAuth information I got back. If I already have such a
user in the system, then I sign in as that user. Otherwise, I ask
the person to register as a new user.
</p><p>
But of course (and yes, this is the last step), I need to define the
method <tt  >User.find_for_facebook_oauth</tt>. Again, the devise documentation
offers a solution, in that you can define this class method as
follows (with some modifications from the original):

<pre     class="programlisting">
def self.find_for_facebook_oauth(access_token, 
 &#8618;signed_in_resource=nil)
  data = access_token['extra']['raw_info']

  if user = User.find_by_email(data["email"])
    user
  else # Create a user with a stub password.
    u = User.new(:email =&gt; data["email"])
    u.password = Devise.friendly_token[0,20]
    u.save!
    u
  end
end
</pre>
</p><p>
When you try to log in again via Facebook, you're thus taken to the URL
from your OAuth handler, and...well, on my system, I get an error,
indicating that my new User instance was not created in the database,
because I violated one or more of the validations on my Rails User
model. Which ones? The e-mail address and password cannot be blank.
</p><p>
How can this be? Well, you can see that if the user does not exist,
then you try to create it with the e-mail address that you got from
Facebook, stored in the &ldquo;data&rdquo; hash that this method creates:

<pre     class="programlisting">
u = User.new(:email =&gt; data["email"])
u.password = Devise.friendly_token[0,20]
u.save!
</pre>
</p><p>
In order to better understand this, I added the following line to the
<tt  >find_for_facebook_oauth</tt> method, just after defining
the &ldquo;data&rdquo; hash:

<pre     class="programlisting">
logger.warn data.to_yaml
</pre>
</p><p>
And sure enough, when I tried to log in via Facebook again, I got a
lot of information about myself in the controller, but not my e-mail
address. That's because the scope that I defined in
config/initializers/devise.rb didn't include &ldquo;email&rdquo;. You can update
that definition:


<pre     class="programlisting">
:scope =&gt; 'email,user_about_me,user_education_history,read_friendlists'
</pre>
</p><p>
Then you have to restart the server (since initializers are 
read only at startup), and click on the &ldquo;sign in with Facebook&rdquo; link
again. This time, you're brought back to the Facebook permissions
page; Facebook wants to know this time if it's okay to pass the user's
e-mail address to the application. I click on the &ldquo;Allow&rdquo; button, and
then get an error.
</p><p>
Notice that you're basically giving the user a random password here.
That's okay in my book, since you don't care about the password for these
users, given that they'll be signing in via Facebook in any event.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xba0580.0x1093ba0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
OAuth has a lot of good things going for it, which benefit both
Web-based applications and their users. As you can see, it can be a
tad complicated to set up, but once you get the hang of it,
adding such functionality to your own applications can be quite
straightforward. And, once you've allowed users to sign in via
Facebook, you can add additional providers, simply by including
additional provider-specific gems, adding a controller class for that
provider, and then adding a provider-specific method on the user
object. Omniauth, and the various provider-specific gems on which it
depends, continues to track the implementation details of OAuth,
allowing you to concentrate on your application, rather than the OAuth

The authoritative site for OAuth is at <a href="http://oauth.net" target="_self">oauth.net</a>. That site
includes documentation, protocol descriptions and much more. It also
describes the differences between OAuth 1 and OAuth 2.

The devise library for Ruby on Rails authentication is at
<a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise" target="_self">https://github.com/plataformatec/devise</a>. The Omniauth authentication
gem is also at GitHub, at <a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth" target="_self">https://github.com/intridea/omniauth</a>. Each
of these packages has a large Wiki on GitHub with documentation, code
examples and FAQs.

If you want a more detailed explanation of what is happening, along
with an indication of how you would test the integration of OAuth into
your application, I recommend the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rails 3 in
Action</em></span> by Ryan Bigg
and Yehuda Katz (Manning, ISBN 978-1-935182-27-6). This is a new
book, but the little I've read through seems quite excellent,
including an entire chapter on OAuth and authentication systems.
