When it comes to e-mail, what do small organizations need? Why? And, how do you make it happen?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe64580.0xf5c240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Every month, more and more small businesses and families depend on e-mail
to stay in business or to remain in fast and cheap contact with distant
relatives. Both groups often need to enforce common rules, such as parental
control or acceptable usage policies. This article is the first in a series 
devoted entirely to building such an e-mail system with free software,
and it is divided in three parts. The first sums up how small groups use e-mail today 
and why it is often a suboptimal solution. The second describes the overall 
architecture. The last part introduces the main characteristics of the
central piece of the system, the SMTP server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe64580.0xf5c348"></a>
The Limits of What's Easily Available Today</h2></div></div><p>
Centralized configuration and logging, automatic blocking of spam and
viruses, access to the same mailboxes from any e-mail client or from
the Web&mdash;these are just a few of the services that both small business
owners and responsible parents want to have under complete
control. Equally important is having constant e-mail addresses,
totally independent from the current Internet access provider. A secure and
usable Webmail interface as well as consolidation in one mailbox
of old accounts from previous ISPs or college days also are a must.
</p><p>
Most groups manage e-mail in one of two ways. The first way is to
make every group member choose any of the big &ldquo;free e-mail for the
masses&rdquo; providers (for example Gmail, Yahoo and so on) and make do with what
those providers offer. This route is the easiest one, but sometimes its only real
benefit may be constant, if generic, addresses. With such providers,
there is little or nothing that can be centrally monitored, configured
or controlled, unless the resident geek manually sets and always keeps 
all the computers in sync&mdash;including every time a user changes
computer or e-mail client. Besides these practical issues, the reliability
and privacy concerns of a whole world going with two or three e-mail
providers are equally obvious.
</p><p>
The second option is to buy professional, dedicated e-mail hosting from
a specialized provider. Note that I said &ldquo;dedicated e-mail
hosting&rdquo;, not
&ldquo;vanilla e-mail services from generic Web hosting companies&rdquo;. Generic Web hosts provide suboptimal spam filtering, at best. Dedicated e-mail hosting
usually offers top-notch spam filtering, reliable e-mail forwarding and so on, because it is a
separate business that requires different know-how and configurations
from Web hosting. All providers of this kind can handle e-mail for any
domain, so they are flexible enough to make many users happy.
</p><p>
If a dedicated e-mail host provides such good service, why look beyond that? 
May small businesses and families want complete 
control of their e-mail features. Other deal-breakers may be insufficient
bandwidth or disk space, not sophisticated enough spam filtering and
privacy concerns. Please note that privacy here doesn't merely mean
&ldquo;a trustworthy provider that never will read your messages&rdquo;. In order to
nail down spam senders with the smallest possible effort, some providers,
including several in the &ldquo;dedicated&rdquo; category, do not read your messages
but add the IP address of the computer from which
you are writing to each e-mail you send. This makes it impossible to send messages like &ldquo;I can't
come to the office for the 30th day in a row; I've flown to Fiji&rdquo; from
home, because everybody able to read and understand e-mail headers will see
immediately that the message came from your home Internet connection. For
some users, this reason alone may be enough to exclude certain providers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe64580.0xf5c768"></a>
A Full Custom Server of the Right Size</h2></div></div><p>
The only way to set up e-mail for your small community exactly like you
want and keep it going with the smallest possible effort is to configure
your own state-of-the-art e-mail server using only free software. And,
that is what this series of articles is all about.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the majority of on-line tutorials on this subject fall
into
two categories: the ultimate single-user e-mail server or the perfect
Linux/BSD e-mail platform for Fortune-500 corporations. Although the first
category is too little even for small groups, tutorials in the second class often
imply that you will be happy to learn, deploy and maintain a bunch of
other servers and databases just to provide Webmail, authentication and
so on to five to ten users.
</p><p>
With only a few users, it is more efficient to stick to
configuration files, limiting the number of third-party components as
much as possible. Whenever possible, this series follows that approach.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe64580.0xf5c920"></a>
What You'll Learn from This Series</h2></div></div><p>
This first article describes only the general architecture of the system
and the essential capabilities of the SMTP server that will be the
basis for the whole environment. In the next articles, I'll cover how to
receive e-mail for several domains, how to relay messages for authorized
users and how to filter spam and viruses at the server level. After that,
I will discuss how to do as much advanced e-mail sorting and processing
as possible on the server. Next, I'll show how to serve the received
messages to desktop e-mail clients or through a Web interface. Along the
way, you also will learn when and how to use a backup MX server, how
to back up mailboxes, how to keep everything under control with automatic
reporting tools and several other cool tricks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe64580.0xf5ca28"></a>
General Considerations and Warnings</h2></div></div><p>
The advantage of a centralized e-mail environment is that there is very
little that can be done from a graphical interface or messed up by
end users. The whole point of going through this hassle is to have
e-mail configured and working always as you prefer&mdash;no matter how often you
or other group members change, test or mix different clients, operating
systems and locations (home, office, Internet kiosks and so on). The right way
to make this happen, however, is to have as much as possible done on one
server, with tools that often are controllable only by text configuration
files. This task is absolutely possible without programming, as long
as one is willing to spend some time tweaking configuration files
and reading the right documentation.
</p><p>
The hardware can be an old computer stored in a closet or a Virtual
Private Server (VPS) in a data center. The first solution saves both
money and the environment (hardware pollutes!). The second solution is much more
reliable, as downtime due to blackouts or broken hardware almost
disappears. Because the configuration and tips described in this series
are the same for both cases, I simply ignore that issue when dealing 
with setup.
</p><p>
To make things easier, only configuration of binary packages available
for your chosen distribution are considered. You may not get the
latest-and-greatest version of everything, but the convenience of
not compiling anything and having automatic updates is too great to
be refused, unless you are a full-time paid administrator. Therefore,
I assume you already have a Linux box and know how to install
binary packages on it.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe64580.0xf5cc38"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Wanted: Specialized E-mail Hosting Only VPS Packages</b></p><p>
Most VPS offers on the market are configured for medium to large Web sites
with a lot of traffic and are overkill for a small e-mail system such as
the one I am discussing here. 
What if there were offers that made you pay only for the disk space
and bandwidth needed for e-mail, but that gave you a VPS with all and only
the packages described here, all preconfigured in the right way? Maybe
your needs include specific services, such as automatically checking
whether you are on
a spammer blacklist, e-mail-oriented disaster recovery and backup MX
hosting if things go bad ten minutes after you leave for a two-week trek
in the Rockies? I am sure there is quite a market for such products. Are
there any providers already offering them? Please let us know.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe64580.0xf5ce48"></a>
The Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
The system requires the components shown in Figure 1. Only the desktop
e-mail client runs on a computer other than the e-mail server.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9721f1.large.jpg"><img src="9721f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. System Requirements
</p></div></div><p>
The SMTP server is the piece that uses the Simple Mail Transport
Protocol to accept legitimate e-mail from the outside world or to ship all
the messages from authorized users, no matter how they were sent, to
their final destinations. This server is assisted by several d&aelig;mons
that
help block spam, viruses or otherwise unwanted connections. Outgoing
messages from external clients are accepted and relayed only after an
authentication procedure.
</p><p>
After it has accepted a message, the SMTP server hands it to a local
delivery agent (LDA) that places it into one or more mailboxes, according
to predefined filtering criteria. The single messages are then passed to
Webmail or desktop clients by an IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol)
server. I focus on IMAP because it works the same way for
both classes of clients, and it also is possible to move messages from
the server to your personal computer with the POP3 protocol. Most IMAP
servers also support POP3. Please note that any Webmail software requires
a Web server (usually Apache) and PHP in order to run.
</p><p>
Our example e-mail box will serve about ten users in two different domains:
myfamily.net and mybusiness.com. The actual applications used in this
series are Postfix (SMTP), Dovecot (IMAP/POP3), Squirrelmail (Webmail)
and procmail (LDA). They are not the only FOSS products suited for this
task, of course, but I have found them to be an excellent combination
in terms of features, documentation, great on-line support and ease of
installation and configuration. Most of the concepts and tricks can be
ported to other products easily, however.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe64580.0xf5d210"></a>
Basic Postfix Concepts: Processes, Variables and Maps</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start looking inside our chosen SMTP
server, Postfix. The anatomy of Postfix already has been described in
another <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> article (see Resources), so I
summarize only the main points
here. Postfix is actually a suite of many programs, some interacting
with user processes, some running as d&aelig;mons, all controlled by a master
d&aelig;mon. Usage of all the d&aelig;mons is specified, one logical line per
d&aelig;mon, in a file called master.cf. Logical lines can extend on more
lines of the file. Local e-mail delivery, for example, can be handled by
a Postfix d&aelig;mon that can write to mbox and Maildir mailboxes
directly
or by an external local delivery agent, such as procmail. Listing 1
shows a snippet of a typical master.cf file.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe64580.0xf5d3c8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Snippet of a Typical master.cf File</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# ==========================================================================
# service type  private unpriv  chroot  wakeup  maxproc command + args
#               (yes)   (yes)   (yes)   (never) (100)
# ==========================================================================
smtp      inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd -v

     &#8618;argv=/usr/bin/procmail -t -m USER=${user} 
     &#8618;EXTENSION=${extension} /etc/procmailrc
</pre></div><p>
Each line starts with the d&aelig;mon name (service) and the way it talks
with Postfix (Internet/UNIX sockets or FIFOs). The next parameters
show whether it's private to the mail system and whether it runs with
or without privileges into a chroot (that is, into a restricted
filesystem). Wakeup and maxproc define the wake-up interval and the maximum
number of processes that may execute this service simultaneously. The
line ends with the actual command that invokes the d&aelig;mon, with all its
options. We'll look in detail at some d&aelig;mons in the upcoming articles. For
now, it's enough to know that one or more -v switches enable verbose
logging and that a - value means use the default value for that field.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe64580.0xf5d630"></a>
Defining Variables: main.cf</h2></div></div><p>
Postfix has hundreds of configuration variables, but don't worry. To
build a working system, you need to set only about 20 of them. To get an
idea of Postfix's capabilities and the way it works, see 
Listing 2. It is an excerpt, by no means complete (or working), of
a real main.cf file. More specifically, it shows only the main options that
must be set to a different value than the default or the ones that are
particularly important for spam fighting and not making an open relay. We
will build a complete main.cf file in upcoming articles in this series.

#Section 1: basic setup
myhostname         = the.full.name.of.your.server (eg mybox.home.network)
mydomain           = $myhostname
myorigin           = $mydomain
  
#Section 2: receiving mail

#Sections 3: define who can relay through this server

#Section 4: define virtual domains and virtual user maps

virtual_mailbox_base    = /var/mail/mail_storage

disable_vrfy_command         = yes
  
#Section 6: ignore unknown senders or those which
#           don't show proper credentials
  
smtpd_helo_restrictions      =
  
smtpd_recipient_restrictions = 
                               reject_invalid_hostname,
                               reject_non_fqdn_hostname,
                               reject_non_fqdn_sender,
                               reject_non_fqdn_recipient,
                               permit_mynetworks,
                               reject_unauth_destination
</pre></div><p>
Section 1 contains the full name of the VPS box. Section 2 defines from
where we accept mail and for which destinations. The first law of each
SMTP server is never to become a spambot by relaying messages of unknown
origin or useless bounce notifications to the Internet. This is what
Section 3 is for. As it is, it means that only messages originated on
the server will be sent outside. Section 4 says that we accept e-mail
for the two myfamily.net and mybusiness.com domains, but only for the
users in the /etc/postfix/vmailbox map, and that we use procmail to
store incoming messages into the /var/mail/mail_storage folder.
</p><p>
When proper SMTP filtering rules are available (as shown in Figure 1), an SMTP
server can recognize and refuse a lot of spam as soon as it is contacted,
without even downloading the whole message. This is what sections 5 and
6 do. Besides the official documentation, their content is described in
full detail in the Postfix anti-UCE cheat sheet (see Resources). Note that the server
actually will work only if you set DNS properly, but this, as well as
the exact meaning of all those variables, is something I'll discuss in
future articles. For now, let's finish by introducing Postfix maps.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe64580.0xf5daa8"></a>
Map Types</h2></div></div><p>
Postfix can store strings and filtering expressions in many indexed or
linear maps. These structures are used to store information on how to
deal with clients, senders and single messages. Indexed maps are binary
databases built from regular text files. External relational databases
also can be used as indexed maps. Linear maps are regular text files
read from top to bottom until a matching record is found, so the order
of the record matters.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article is an introduction to the topic of this series, rather
than a practical tutorial in order to clarify
some general concepts. But, don't worry; we'll get to the practical
concerns
in the next article. In the
meantime, take a quick look the documentation
listed in the Resources and keep it handy for when you read &ldquo;Work
the Mail, Part II&rdquo;. You also are welcome to write me directly about any
specific e-mail tip you would like to find in this series.
