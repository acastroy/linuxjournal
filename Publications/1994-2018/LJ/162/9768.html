<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #162, October 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Ondrej Zary</b></span> has produced a new free software driver to support
<span   class="bold"><b>IRTouchSystems touchscreens</b></span>. The
manufacturer releases only closed-source drivers, so Ondrej had to hack into the data flow itself and do
his own analysis in order to understand how to interact with the
hardware.
</p><p>
There's a new performance monitoring
tool on the block. <span   class="bold"><b>Mark Seger</b></span> has
been coding and tweaking his <span   class="bold"><b>collectl
tool</b></span> (<a href="http://collectl.sf.net" target="_self">collectl.sf.net</a>)
for about four years, and he finally has decided to release it under a free
software license. It tracks a whole bunch of system stats
and displays them in various formats. Mark has invited everyone to use
it, abuse it and send him bug reports. Although because it already has
been in use on his personal system for years, it probably
is quite robust and stable.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span>'s coming out with some new
<span   class="bold"><b>IOMMU hardware</b></span>, aka <span   class="bold"><b>Virtualization
Technology for Directed I/O</b></span>, and <span   class="bold"><b>Anil S.
Keshavamurthy</b></span> has posted a
patch to support that hardware in Linux. There is still some question
as to whether the code is quite ready to be integrated into the
kernel&mdash;<span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> thinks it
might be too slow&mdash;but overall, Anil's work
has received plenty of support, and it is excellent to see Intel being
so proactive in supporting its hardware.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Chris Mason</b></span> has been working on 
<span   class="bold"><b>BTRFS</b></span> (BTRee
filesystem), a new effort aimed at data integrity. As <span   class="bold"><b>Albert D.
Cahalan</b></span> said during the discussion following Chris' announcement,
storage hardware can't really be trusted, so filesystems have to
take up the slack and make sure users' data doesn't get lost. BTRFS
seems to be finding a lot of support among kernel developers; however,
it's still in the early stages and shouldn't be used for any kind of
production environment yet. One of Chris's main ideas is to keep data
integrity support simple, even if it means not implementing fancier
features that may be popular among other filesystems.
</p><p>
Every once in a while someone decides to dig out one of the
particularly ugly parts of the kernel and fix it up nice. <span   class="bold"><b>Nick Piggin</b></span>
has done that recently with the <span   class="bold"><b>buffer
layer</b></span>. This is the part of the
kernel that deals with block devices, tracking a variety of data,
including the status of writes to particular disk blocks. Nick's
replacement, <span   class="bold"><b>fsblock</b></span>, is a much cleaner, shinier implementation. Among
other improvements, fsblock's support for large block sizes is much
simpler and nicer than what was there before. His code also avoids the
deadlocks common to the existing version. But, although these and many
other improvements definitely are great, fsblock is still in the early
stages of development, and folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Jeff
Garzik</b></span> are concerned that
other aspects of the buffer-layer problem space may force fsblock's
code into nastier and more tangled knots. So far, the only filesystem
Nick has ported to use fsblock has been <span   class="bold"><b>Minix</b></span>, a famously simple and
academic filesystem intended for student consumption. The more
complicated journaling filesystems, such as ext3/4 and ReiserFS, will be
the real test. And, even if fsblock eventually does rise to that
challenge, developers like <span   class="bold"><b>Christoph
Hellwig</b></span> don't think Nick's
improvements are significant enough to justify replacing the whole
buffer layer and porting all that filesystem code.

<h2 class="title">Ten Questions for Sean Moss-Pultz</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #162, October 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When iPhone launched in late June 2007, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Newsweek</em></span>
snarked, &ldquo;Not since Moses
parted the Red Sea has anything this miraculous appeared on earth. Will
it cure cancer?&rdquo; Meanwhile, the OpenMoko Project has been hard at work
providing earth with a Linux-based cure for iPhone.
</p><p>
We've covered OpenMoko a number of times
already, but all were before iPhone parted the
seas of mainstream ink otherwise being spilled
on war, politics and Paris Hilton coverage. So,
we interrupted the overbooked time of Sean
Moss-Pultz, Program Manager of OpenMoko, to
probe his thinking about OpenMoko in a
post-iPhone world.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>LJ: First, can you give us a point-by-point comparison of OpenMoko
with iPhone?</b></span>
</p><p>
SM-P: You can check this out: <a href="http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/IPhone" target="_self">wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/IPhone</a>.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: But really, OpenMoko is not an &ldquo;open-source alternative&rdquo; to
iPhone?</b></span>
</p><p>
SM-P: No, not even close. We're in a totally different market. The
last thing on earth I want to do is start copying the iPhone&mdash;no offense
to Apple. They've built a beautiful product, but do we really need
another closed, locked-down phone?
</p><p>
Fundamentally, we're totally different. End-user Freedom is our passion.
Apple is about giving you an incredibly polished experience&mdash;exactly how
they want you to have it. End users really have no freedom. They
cannot change the device if they don't like the way Apple chooses to make
things. OpenMoko is the anti-iPhone.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: So, you're pro-FOSS?</b></span>
</p><p>
SM-P: The entire OpenMoko system and application software are built
using free and open-source software (FOSS).
</p><p>
On the system side, OpenMoko uses software with a tireless history of
success and stability, such as the Linux kernel, the GNU C library, the
X Window System and the GTK+ toolkit, to name only a few. OpenMoko is
Mobile FOSS.
</p><p>
Apple won't even give you an SDK for the iPhone.
</p><p>
We give you <span   class="emphasis"><em>everything</em></span> for Free&mdash;exactly the
same tools that we use internally. We want you
to change this device&mdash;personalize away to your
heart's content.
</p><p>
I like to describe OpenMoko as a movement to create an open platform that
empowers people to personalize their phones, much like computers, in any
way they see fit.
</p><p>
Apple makes sure their entire software stack stays closed. We chose to
make the entire software stack open. From a control standpoint&mdash;the
things corporations love&mdash;this borders on insanity. But, I think by
pushing these borders, we will let loose the possibility for immense
innovation.
</p><p>
Innovation, in my opinion, is seldom found within the endless cubicles
of a large corporation. Most commonly, it manifests itself within the
intense focus and concentration that all individuals seem to have
access to when they stare at a single problem long enough.
</p><p>
Staying with a problem long after most would quit is a luxury few
companies can afford. Instead, I want to focus on the fundamentals&mdash;the
framework&mdash;to use a more specific term. This includes the following parts:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
UI&mdash;common look and feel for end users.
</p></li><li><p>
Data&mdash;common storage model for applications.
</p></li><li><p>
Libraries&mdash;common platform for developers.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
We believe these are some of the key areas to solidify for
innovation to form. And, we believe this will benefit not just my company
(FIC), but everyone who uses a mobile phone.
</p><p>
We really try to make things as easy as possible for developers.
Software-wise, our platform is still in the early stages, but things are
moving fast. It's an incredibly exciting time for us now.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Does OpenMoko see verticals as the key to breaking open the twin
silos of phone makers and carriers? If so, which ones? You mention
&ldquo;major corporations, Fortune 500s, hospitals, real estate, engineering,
the arts....&rdquo; Is OpenMoko downstream with any of those? How?</b></span>
</p><p>
SM-P: Enterprise is a very interesting vertical market for us now. I
can't mention exactly whom we're talking with currently, but it's all the big
names. If you think about this, it makes total sense. They have huge IT
budgets and the ability to put scores of people working on custom
solutions. More and more they also are running GNU/Linux on the server.
So, having another client (besides cumbersome PCs) makes for quite a
value proposition.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Here's why we ask. Steve Jobs said the iPhone is closed to
developers at Cingular's (now AT&amp;T's) request. Companies like AT&amp;T
generally don't like open phones. Yet, we have evidence that phone makers
and carriers will both open up and make exceptions for big vertical
buys.</b></span>
</p><p>
SM-P: Yeah, I think this will be a huge market.
I mean, most everyone I know in business uses
company phones. Why not let the company
personalize the phone for its employees?

</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Who are the early developers, exactly?</b></span>
</p><p>
SM-P: Hackers, developers, technologies, hobbyists...students...really,
we've seen so many people it's mind-boggling. I'm totally blown
away by the sheer volume of interest we are getting now.
</p><p>
This is quite a pleasant surprise. Sure, we thought an open phone would
shake things up a bit. But this is more like an earthquake.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What are we seeing in pickup from different parts of the
world?</b></span>
</p><p>
SM-P: Well, I would say it's still mainly a western thing. Europe and
the US represent most of the e-mails. But, South America, Africa and
Asia now are really starting to pick up pace. It's really getting global!
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: Jonathan Schwartz of Sun showed off an OpenMoko phone, no? What
more is coming of that?</b></span>
</p><p>
SM-P: Yeah, that was our Neo. I really can't
make any more comments than that now. Sorry.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: How do you see the open-phone market developing? In what ways will
it resemble and/or differ from the &ldquo;white box&rdquo; computer market in which
Linux grew?</b></span>
</p><p>
SM-P: Oh, great question. I think the market
will be quite different. In the embedded system
world, there is just a tighter level of
integration between hardware and software.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
LJ: What about other phone uses, such as camera, texting, audio (for
example,
podcast) recording and music/video playback?</b></span>
</p><p>
SM-P: We need to open the mobile ecosystem. A mobile phone has the
potential to be a platform that can do anything that a small computer
with broadband access can do.
</p><p>
For the people pushing this project, an open phone is not really even a
product. It's the very embodiment of our vision of technology. We
absolutely, passionately, believe that something as fundamental to our
lives as the mobile phone must be open.

Non-open-source users typically use price as a factor in their decisions.
They think that a more expensive computer will be faster, more sturdy,
and will last longer. That's not necessarily true. It is definitely not
true in software, and it is becoming less true in hardware....We believe
that all our other worthy goals (such as gaining market share for Linux)
will be accomplished best by a myopic, utterly self-absorbed focus on
solid hardware and honest customer support.

Today Gates openly concedes that tolerating piracy turned out to be
Microsoft's best long-term strategy. That's why Windows is used on an
estimated 90% of China's 120 million PCs. &ldquo;It's easier for our
software to compete with Linux when there's piracy than when there's
not&rdquo;, Gates says. &ldquo;Are you kidding? You can get the real thing, and you
get the same price.&rdquo; Indeed, in China's back alleys, Linux often costs
more than Windows because it requires more disks. And Microsoft's own
prices have dropped so low it now sells a $3 package of Windows and
Office to students.

<h2 class="title">A Ticket out of Poverty</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Wojciech Gryc</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #162, October 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Looking beyond the walls of our temporary office in Nairobi, Kenya, one
can see fences with barbed wire and security guards near any building
audacious enough to show a sign of wealth. Everything seems brown here,
from the dust on the roads and in the air to the rusty tin roofs
protecting most residents from the sun and rain. We are in Kibera&mdash;with an estimated 1.5 million residents, it is the largest slum in Africa.
</p><p>
Our project is unconventional, for not only do we avoid hiring security
guards, we also were invited by the youth within the community. We find
ourselves here to run a media development project, powered by open-source
software. We avoided most travel warnings and, to some,
left our common sense at the border when we chose to bring laptops and
digital cameras to one of the poorest areas in the world. Many residents
in Kibera live on a few dollars a day, grappling problems like HIV/AIDS
and malnutrition, and have never used a computer before. When we arrived,
however, we were greeted by quick-learning youth interested in trying
new technologies and media tools to improve their lives and the state
of their entire community.
</p><p>
This is the second such project that Five Minutes to Midnight (FMM,
<a href="http://www.fiveminutestomidnight.org" target="_self">www.fiveminutestomidnight.org</a>), a youth-led organization from
Canada, is running. Initially started to promote youth involvement in
human rights through media and journalism, FMM launched the Article 13
Initiative (A13I, <a href="http://www.a13i.org" target="_self">www.a13i.org</a>) in December 2005 to promote the
use of open-source software in media projects in developing countries. Its
pilot project took place that December and the following January in
N'Djamena, Chad, one of the poorest countries in the world.
</p><p>
With a base operating system of Fedora Core and packages, such as The GIMP,
Inkscape and OpenOffice.org, the project began through a partnership with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Rafigui</em></span>, Chad's only national youth-led newspaper. It provided technical
training to a dozen youth with the aim of helping sustain the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Rafigui</em></span>
newspaper. The project was a resounding success, with follow-up workshops
taking place in Burkina Faso in January 2006 and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Rafigui</em></span> now planning
its own open-source software-focused workshops for the near future.
</p><p>
Now, in July 2007, FMM is finishing a new set of workshops in Kenya with a
local organization called Shining Hope for the Community (SHOFCO). Working
with 20 youth from Kibera, the seven-week project focuses on training
in open-source software and journalism, as well as exploring how Web
2.0 tools can be used within international development. The seeds of the
project were planted informally almost a year ago, when SHOFCO received
a small grant to purchase a printer and received an Ubuntu CD in the
mail. The printer helped them start the first community-run newsletter
in Kibera, while the CD instilled a sense of technical curiosity in the
youth. Even today, a year later, we get requests to teach some of the
young people how to use Ubuntu.
</p><p>
One of the biggest advantages of open-source software and using or creating openly
available resources is that such projects easily can be initiated by
others. What is surprising is that such projects can end up costing
very little and have incredibly fast results. If driven by a motivated
organization, the projects often can be sustained long past the initial
workshops and have an immense potential to help many people.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The best piece of advice for starting such a workshop is to be flexible,
open-minded and to think critically about the work being done. Such
questioning should focus on everything from the general idea of using
open-source software to specifics, such as which printer drivers to include on a resource
CD. Even the idea of using open-source software was not a trivial one when initially
planning workshops in Chad. The specific tasks of newspaper
creation&mdash;text editing, layout design, photo editing and
illustration&mdash;are well supported by open-source software packages,
such as OpenOffice.org, Scribus, GIMP
and Inkscape, but the same may not be true for tasks related to video
production or animation.
</p><p>
Technical questions are but a small subset of the ones you will need to
answer, and most questions are difficult to fathom or predict. Traveling
from a wealthy country to a relatively poor one comes with many challenges
surrounding power structures and stereotypes. An illustrative example
comes from a former workshop participant, who warned his teachers that
students will stay silent, smile and then nod out of respect for the
instructor, even if they do not understand a single word.
</p><p>
Teaching anything about computers to new users is not easy, and the
difficulty is compounded when students only have a basic level of literacy
or the language of instruction is not their first language. A typical
response to such challenges is localization. Indeed, one of the advantages
of using open-source software is the ability to customize user interfaces,
either by modifying labels or going the extra mile and re-inventing entire
user interfaces. Although many Linux distributions sport numerous languages,
incorporating them into lessons is controversial at best.
</p><p>
The linguistic history of Africa, like any other continent, is complex,
and many languages tend to be oral ones, with either no written versions
or ones that are barely taught in schools. For example, Swahili is very
popular as a spoken language in Kenya, but most people learn to read
and write in English in schools in Kibera. Working in Swahili is seen
as substandard to English, even if it is conversationally easier. A
further problem is that although the operating system may be localized,
the likelihood that every package within it is also localized is small,
especially if the language being considered is not mainstream. Even
with apparently French packages, some help files would say, &ldquo;To be
translated&rdquo; (in English), causing a great deal of confusion to
French-speaking students in Chad.
</p><p>
No matter how difficult the software or seemingly ineffective the
lesson plans, most students are happy to be given an opportunity to
acquire technical training and will, in fact, learn a great deal. We
have noticed this regardless of operating system, be it Fedora Core or
Windows, or whether we're teaching programming in Java or text editing
in OpenOffice.org. The most important aspect of the technical plan should
be its simplicity in terms of maintenance and sustainability. Indeed,
if you make sure that the computers function long after you are gone
and are well stocked with tutorials and books providing instructions on
software packages, there's a good chance students will go out of their
way to learn what's available&mdash;just make sure your local partnering
organization provides the security to store those resources and gives
your workshop participants the ability to access them.
</p><p>
In this sense, it is often best to avoid complex software or hardware
configurations. For our work, we often prefer laptops&mdash;they're cheap to
transport, have only one plug and use battery power when electricity
is unavailable (which can be a major problem in Chad and Kenya). We
also avoid setting up complex network configurations or user accounts,
unless this is something we can teach within the workshops themselves.

Even if the workshops go well and you end your multiweek experience
in bliss, there's often one difficulty creeping about: practical
applications. All effort is for naught if, at the end of the weeks, there
is no longer-term plan for how the software will be used to improve the
organization or start new projects. At the beginning of this article, I
mentioned the importance of focusing workshops around a project and how
FMM works specifically with organizations interested in printed media. In this
case, we often make a newspaper issue based on workshops and assume the
lessons learned will be used to improve the newspaper. In some cases,
the benefits may be more direct, such as helping participants get job
offers to move beyond the poverty that has plagued their lives.
</p><p>
In many cases, there are no easy answers to questions raised about
planning a media development project. Indeed, international development
is fraught with ethical issues and cultural challenges. One of the most
difficult aspects of such work is that although a project may last several
weeks, the end result is the teacher leaving and returning to a lavish
lifestyle, while the participants may remain in impoverished areas for
years to come, if not their entire lives. Nevertheless, such projects
are worthwhile because they bring hope to the communities they focus on,
and instructors and organizers often gain unforgettable friendships and
experiences. So, the next time you have a vacation or a few weeks free,
consider getting involved in such a project. In such cases, open source
is more than a software paradigm&mdash;it is a ticket out of poverty.

In the last couple issues' UpFront sections, we've followed Dell's toe-dipping into the
surging demand for Linux-based laptops and desktops. It's important,
however, to look at the other end of the corporate scale for gear sources
as well. EmperorLinux and LinuxCertified are two familiar standouts
there. A new one starting to get attention is ZaReason, Inc., in
Berkeley, California.
</p><p>
ZaReason grew out of family volunteer work at the Alameda Computer
Recycling Center (see the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Index this month for some interesting stats about the
ACRC) and crafts cheap, high-quality machines, intended mostly for
hands-on techies. &ldquo;Typically, we ship to longtime Linux activists who
want fully open-source machines, but do not have the time to research
components and configurations&rdquo;, says the company's About page.
