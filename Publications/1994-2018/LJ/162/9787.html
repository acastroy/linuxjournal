An overview of the awesome power and configurability of MPlayer.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1474580.0x156c298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
What should the Linux movie player of your dreams do?
It should play any movie/video that you throw at it. No 
questions asked&mdash;just play. It should allow seeking
and volume control with the keyboard and mouse. It should
work with an infrared remote controller and also play 
television. It should play DVDs and VCDs too.
MPlayer can do all of this and much, much more.
</p><p>
MPlayer also is an award-winning, mature, open-source program that still
is actively in development. Perhaps one day in the not-too-distant
future,
support for DVD menus, color subtitles, picture in picture video,
MIDI and audio effects plugins like the ones for SoX
will be added.
</p><p>
MPlayer is admirably stable for the job it does. However, it does
crash under certain circumstances, such as with certain video drivers. 
</p><p>
It is a mature application that has no parallel. MEncoder, its companion 
video encoder program, does a much better job than FFMPEG
in transcoding videos, although it is a bit difficult to use and learn.
</p><p>
Now, let's take a look at MPlayer's magic. The following command plays
a stream URL after resampling it to 48,000Hz and combining channels
into left-right stereo:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -af lavcresample=48000,hrtf 
 &#8618;'http://mp3.streampower.be/radio1-mid.mp3'
</pre>
</p><p>
The following command grabs the same URL stream and dumps it to a file
named stream.aac:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -dumpstream -dumpfile stream.aac 
 &#8618;-softvol -softvol-max 2000 -af 
 &#8618;lavcresample=48000,volnorm=2:0.5 
 &#8618;'http://mp3.streampower.be/radio1-mid.mp3' 
</pre>
</p><p>
You can open the stream file from another terminal window with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer stream.aac
</pre>
</p><p>
Then what happens?
The first instance of MPlayer continues to dump the network stream to a
file and the second plays it for you&mdash;time-shifted Internet radio.
Cool, eh?
</p><p>
Most of the switches are not necessary to accomplish this, but they show
MPlayer's ability to use the Linux command line so elegantly. 
The -softvol and -softvol-max switches invoke the software volume
control feature of MPlayer. It reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, but
it can amplify the signal to very high levels. 
</p><p>
The volnorm=2:0.5 filter invokes the volume normalization audio
filter. The first argument, 2, specifies that several samples are to be 
used to smooth the volume variations. The 0.5 sets the maximum amplitude
to which you want the volume normalized.
As you can see, MPlayer provides a high level of customization. 
</p><p>
The other options on the command line should not be difficult to decipher.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1474580.0x156c8c8"></a>
Playlists</h2></div></div><p>
The following is a command similar to the first one above. In this case, however,
you specify a playlist URL. Unlike the above command, this one may
not work for you, depending on whether the file happens to be
available from the SHOUTcast site when you try it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -af lavcresample=48000,hrtf -playlist 
 &#8618;'http://www.shoutcast.com/sbin/shoutcast-playlist.pls?rn
&#8618;=1025&amp;file=filename.pls'
</pre>
</p><p>
The -playlist option is used only with stream URLs that have a
.pls extension in the stream. 
</p><p>
You can create your own playlists in a variety of ways. Here is one
way to do it with the find command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ find /home/girish/music -name "*mp3 
 &#8618;-or -name "*ogg" &gt; ~/playlist.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, fire up MPlayer with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -playlist ~/playlist.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
The following variant shuffles the list and plays songs in random
order without repeating songs:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -shuffle -playlist ~/playlist.txt
</pre>
</p><p>
Naturally, MPlayer is a media player. You don't have to limit yourself
to audio files. You could add any MPlayer-playable media file into the
mix, including videos, movies, television, radio and, of course, Internet
streams.
</p><p>
In addition to this simple line-based playlist format, MPlayer also has
excellent support for ASX, M3U and other popular playlist formats.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1474580.0x156cd40"></a>
Special Effects</h2></div></div><p>
There is good support for audio effects, and the karaoke effect
especially gets 
interesting with certain songs. It is not perfect, but you can attenuate
the voice in a song a great deal. Use the following command to activate
karaoke mode:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -af karaoke song.mp3
</pre>
</p><p>
MPlayer also has a ten-octave band equalizer. The following command
ignores
the middle frequency bands and amplifies the frequencies around 31.25Hz by 7dB, 62.5Hz by 8dB, 125Hz by 5dB and all of the frequencies
around 4, 8 and 16Hz are attenuated by 2dB:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -af equalizer=7:8:5:0:0:0:-2:-2:-2 video.mpg
</pre>
</p><p>
The following command gives a live effect to playback. Try it with songs
that sound monotonous:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -af extrastereo song.mp3
</pre>
</p><p>
You can issue a command like the following to play the third song
five times:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer song1.mp3 song2.ogg file.wav -loop 5
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to repeat the whole list five times, type the
following instead:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer { song1.mp3 song2.ogg file.wav } -loop 5
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can use -loop 0 to play something over and over again.
</p><p>
Additionally, there are many audio effect plugins designed especially for
multichannel and 3-D audio. If you want some really advanced audio
effects, try the SoX Swiss Army knife. It is another
command-line application that excels in professional audio effects.
</p><p>
You can specify multiple audio filters on the command line and they are
applied one after another in a chain.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9787f1.large.jpg"><img src="9787f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. MPlayer Audio/Video Filter Chaining
</p></div></div><p>
What if you like a certain audio filter chain and you want to save the
resulting audio to a file? The following command saves the output
of filtering to the file named filtered.wav rather than playing it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -ao pcm:file=filtered.wav -channels 4 -af
lavcresample=48000,hrtf,pan=2:1:0:0:0.3:0.5:0.5:0:12 audio.ogg
</pre>
</p><p>
The lavcresample filter resamples the frequency of audio.ogg to 48,000Hz.
</p><p>
The pan filter is a very powerful and sophisticated filter. It mixes the
input audio channels into the specified output channels in various amplitudes.
</p><p>
In this example, we use the -channels switch to specify four input
channels. The first argument to pan is 2 to specify two output channels.
In the first pair of arguments after that, the 1:0 specifies the amplitude of
the first input channel that is fed into the two output channels. It goes
into the left channel with an amplification factor of 1. The second 
input channel goes into the right channel with an amplification factor 
of 0.3 (0:0.3), and the third input channel is divided
equally into both output channels (0.5:0.5). The fourth channel goes
into the right channel with an amplification factor of 12.
</p><p>
You can use the following command to re-encode the WAV file to Ogg:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ oggenc -q 9 filtered.wav 
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1474580.0x156d688"></a>
The Command Subsystem</h2></div></div><p>
MPlayer has a very rich input command processing subsystem that
can be manipulated with the keyboard, mouse, joystick or LIRC remote
control. You also can customize several keyboard keys to invoke
MPlayer's controls.
</p><p>
The following provides the list of keys that can be configured. The
defaults are very sensible, and you may not need to change them:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -input keylist
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can find MPlayer's controls for seeking, volume control,
brightness correction and other things with the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -input cmdlist
</pre>
</p><p>
The slave.txt file that comes with MPlayer's documentation explains how to
customize the input.conf and menu.conf files that come with the MPlayer
package in your Linux distribution.
</p><p>
You also can have MPlayer accept input commands from a FIFO file
(FIFO stands for First In, First Out). This comes in handy when it is reading
the media from the standard input:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkfifo /tmp/fifo
$ cat playlist.txt | mplayer -input 
 &#8618;file:/tmp/fifo -cache 8192 -playlist -
</pre>
</p><p>
Typing the following mutes and executes it again with the audio unmuted:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo 'mute' &gt; /tmp/fifo
</pre>
</p><p>
You can use the mouse for the usual seek operations. The mouse wheel is
configured by default to seek files in both directions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1474580.0x156db00"></a>
On-Screen Display</h2></div></div><p>
Apropos of input methods, MPlayer has excellent support for on-screen
display (OSD). I normally use only the superb
scalable TTF fonts. These are not available on the MPlayer Web site.
</p><p>
The following command displays a timer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -osdlevel 3 -font 
 &#8618;/home/girish/.ttffonts/Comicbd.ttf video.avi
</pre>
</p><p>
See Figure 2 for a sample of this display. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9787f2.large.jpg"><img src="9787f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. MPlayer with Basic OSD Support
</p></div></div><p>
You can create a custom menu to browse using the keyboard
with the OSD facility. It even has a console where you can enter
MPlayer slave commands.

Figure 5. MPlayer with OSD of Media File Information
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, the scalability of the OSD fonts does not break with the video
scale filter.
</p><p>
Here is how to create this kind of configuration. First, set up
most everything in the config file. Here is my ~/.mplayer/config file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# Write your default config options here!
# Use Matrox driver by default.
vo=sdl
font=/home/girish/.ttffonts/comicbd.ttf
vf=hue,eq,screenshot
#menu-startup=yes
menu=yes
subfont-autoscale=3
subfont-osd-scale=8
subfont-text-scale=8
subpos=50
spuaa=4
osdlevel=3
# I love doing headstand (Sirsasana) while watching videos.
#flip=yes
# Decode/encode multiple files from PNG,
# start with mf://filemask
mf=type=png:fps=25
# Eerie negative images are cool.
#vf=eq2=1.0:-0.8
</pre>
</p><p>
The input configuration and menu configuration are stored separately
in input.conf and menu.conf, respectively. The menu.conf file needs to
have a section that looks something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;cmdlist name="main" title="MPlayer OSD menu" ptr="&lt;&gt;" &gt;
     &lt;e name="Pause" ok="pause"/&gt;
     &lt;e name="Prev/Next" ok="pt_step 1" cancel="pt_step -1"/&gt;
     &lt;e name="Jump to ..." ok="set_menu jump_to"/&gt;
     &lt;e name="Open ..." ok="set_menu open_file"/&gt;
     &lt;e name="Open playlist ..." ok="set_menu open_list"/&gt;
     &lt;e name="Help" ok="set_menu man"/&gt;
     &lt;e name="Pref" ok="set_menu pref_main"/&gt;
     &lt;e name="Properties" ok="set_menu properties"/&gt;
     &lt;e name="Console" ok="set_menu console0"/&gt;
     &lt;e name="Quit" ok="quit"/&gt;
&lt;/cmdlist&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You need this line in input.conf in order to tell MPlayer what
event invokes the menu. The setting here invokes the menu if you click
the left-mouse button:

<pre     class="programlisting">
MOUSE_BTN0 menu main
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1474580.0x1564f98"></a>
Custom Subtitles</h2></div></div><p>
Not surprisingly, MPlayer understands close to 12 subtitle formats, and it
has its own MPSub format too. The options for subtitle display are the
richest I have seen. You can display subtitles in any size, any position
on the video, move them dynamically with the keyboard, adjust the delay,
change the transparency, format them into multiple lines and so on.
</p><p>
Here is the most basic usage of the file subtitles.txt:

<pre     class="programlisting">
FORMAT=TIME
# first number  : wait this much after 
# previous subtitle disappeared
# second number : display the current 
# subtitle for this many seconds

2 3
What is going on?

4 3
How are you doing?

8 3
You are wrong!

0 3
A long long, time ago...
in a galaxy far away...

0 3

0 200
I don't understand this.
</pre>
</p><p>
Tell MPlayer to use this file with a command like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -sub subtitles.txt 
 &#8618;-font ~/.ttffonts/Verdana.ttf video.avi
</pre>
</p><p>
This next command dumps the subtitles file into the srt format into
the file dumpsrt.sub in the current directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -sub subtitles.txt video.avi -dumpsrtsub
</pre>
</p><p>
You can take a quick look at all subtitles in the file by pressing
the Y and G keys. Of course, you can specify multiple subtitle 
files, and you can switch between them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1474580.0x1565308"></a>
Create Screenshots</h2></div></div><p>
Want to take screenshots with MPlayer? It's easy. Here's a sample command
to use when you start to play a video:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -vf screenshot video.avi
</pre>
</p><p>
Press S when you want to take a screenshot. If you want a screenshot
every five seconds, try the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -vo png -vf screenshot -sstep 5 video.avi
</pre>
</p><p>
What if you want to take a screenshot of every frame? Set MPlayer to
accept slave commands with a FIFO, and type these commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkfifo /tmp/fifo
$ mplayer -input file:/tmp/fifo video.mpg
$ echo 'screenshot 1' &gt; /tmp/fifo
</pre>
</p><p>
Toggle the screenshot process with the following command while the
video is playing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo 'screenshot 1' &gt; /tmp/fifo
</pre>
</p><p>
You might want to use the -vf spp,scale=1024:768 switch to get full-screen
screenshots.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1474580.0x15656d0"></a>
Even More Power</h2></div></div><p>
There's much more MPlayer can do. You can encode image files into
a video and extract frames into image files with MPlayer. You also
can watch analog television with the tv:// option and watch DVB channels
with the dvb:// option. It supports a wide variety of streaming
protocols,
including RTP, RTSP, MMS, SDP and LIVE5555 streaming.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1474580.0x15657d8"></a>
Discover the Power Yourself</h2></div></div><p>
The following command lists the available filters:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -af help
</pre>
</p><p>
The man page and MPlayer's HTML documentation have more thorough descriptions of
its options. Typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -vo help
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1474580.0x15659e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
lists the compiled video output drivers.
</p><p>
You can play an arbitrary audio file with the video using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer video.mpg -audiofile audio.aac
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, MPlayer can play a wide variety of audio and video media
files. The following commands list them:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mplayer -vo help

$ mplayer -ao help
</pre>
</p><p>
Try using the -audio-demuxer switch along with -rawaudio.
</p><p>
I hope this gets you started in discovering the awesome power
of MPlayer.
Enjoy your multimedia experience!
