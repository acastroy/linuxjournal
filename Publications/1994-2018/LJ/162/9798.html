Why settle for VoIP when you can pack digital media in the same package?

When I considered evaluating SysMaster's Tornado M20 Media Center, I
thought I was simply evaluating a video/voice IP telephone. Imagine my
surprise when I discovered that it also could handle IPTV, streaming
audio, stored graphics, IM, e-mail, RSS news and weather! I thought
all it needed was a built-in calculator. Then, I read the Owner's Manual
and discovered that it does have a calculator function. Wow! All this
inside a box the size of an average speaker phone, and it even has space for
10Mb LAN, 802.1a Wi-Fi and a 3.5 color video screen. For about 
$250 US, this device seems to be able to do everything my MythTv system 
can do, but it's <span   class="emphasis"><em>much</em></span> smaller! 
</p><p>
Enough hype. Let's talk about practical issues.
</p><p>
As soon as I unboxed the unit, I was immediately struck by how heavy
it was. This is not a phone you'll be dragging across your desk
every time you lift the handset. When you put this unit on your desk,
it's going to stay where you put it, and it's going to look nice sitting
there. The M20 is a very clean, professional-looking phone.
</p><p>
Appearances are more important than you might think. I once was involved
in a Voice-over-IP (VoIP) evaluation project where we set up a VoIP system
and deployed a few phones for potential users. The prevailing comments
we received from the users were that they liked the system. They liked
the sound quality. They hated the phone. They said it looked too
much like a toy. Obviously, we ended up taking another direction.
</p><p>
The M20 is black and silver-tone with clearly labeled buttons. There are
no silly icons next to each button to make you guess what the button does.
The handset, though perhaps a bit light, is comfortable to use. The
color display and pivoting camera on the side of the unit tease
functionality beyond mere voice communication.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9798f1.large.jpg"><img src="9798f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The SysMaster M20 VoIP phone is actually a digital media
center.
</p></div></div><p>
The M20 is a four-line VoIP telephone that uses the SIP protocol
to make and receive voice and video phone calls. Video conferencing uses
the H.264 protocol. For voice calls, the device can use the G.711, G.729
and G.726-32 codecs. For video calls, the unit supports H.263. Streaming
media uses MP3 and MPEG-4. The unit's network configuration is done via
DHCP, PPPoE or can be done manually. The rest of the configuration is
done with a Web interface or a central provisioning mechanism via HTTP. As
far as I can tell, there is no closed or proprietary functionality in
this unit, which is important to me as a Linux and open-source advocate.
</p><p>
Because there are many voice-only VoIP phones out there, most of which
are considerably less expensive, I opted not even to bother testing the
voice-only capability and jumped straight to the main event, video. So, I
asked one of the technical-support staff members at SysMaster to initiate
a video call to me.
</p><p>
When the M20 receives a call, it indicates that it is a video call
by displaying a V next to the caller-ID information on the
display. If you want to establish a video call, you simply press the
VIDEO button on the phone. On the other hand, if you want to
establish a voice-only call, you pick up the handset, just like a regular
phone, and the video function is disabled. Placing a voice or video call
is done similarly.
</p><p>
Before we started our video call, the technician made sure I
understood that the quality of the call was limited by the available
bandwidth. I was using a residential DSL connection, so that would be
the limiting factor. However, when we made the call, I didn't feel
limited at all.
</p><p>
I was able to see the technician clearly, and in color&mdash;the
color was a bit washed out though. Later, I discovered that the video
camera was quite tunable, and that the camera's brightness, sensitivity
and hue were all adjustable. I suspect his camera was just poorly
adjusted. When I was playing with the phone earlier that morning,
I was able to use the camera and see myself on the display, in full,
vivid color. As scary as that was, it wasn't the phone's fault.
</p><p>
As with any CCD camera with a slow frame rate, objects that are moving 
quickly tend to blur, but normal speaking and moving looked natural. 
However, when the technician waved his hand across the field of view to 
demonstrate the effect, the blurring was apparent. The default frame 
rate of 3&ndash;5 frames per second can be adjusted, but it seemed adequate 
for normal usage. Adjusting it much higher probably would have exhausted 
my available bandwidth and caused the call quality to drop sharply.
</p><p>
Even though we had a full video stream between us, the sound quality was
still quite usable. The sound quality wasn't quite up to the level of
the Polycom 501 I use at home, but in my opinion, nothing is. Even so,
it was better than many VoIP phones I've used in the past.
</p><p>
The M20 supports all of the normal call functions, such as call forwarding,
call transfer, hold, do-not-disturb, message waiting and voice mail. The
phone supports Network Address Translation (NAT) as well as multiple
server registrations.
</p><p>
In addition to normal call features, the M20 can function as an alarm
clock by sounding the phone ringer at preselected dates and times. But,
you can take it further than that. The device also can be configured to call
an external phone number at a preselected time.
</p><p>
The device can store up to 80 voice-mail messages locally. The voice-mail
system amounts to an internal answering machine, but at least it doesn't
require a centralized server. Recorded messages are easy to retrieve
via the menu or with a Web browser. The company's literature boasts
advanced IVR (Interactive Voice Response) capability, and I think you'll
agree I've got enough to write about as it is without getting into
that function in any depth.
</p><p>
I'm told that the devices will auto-discover each other on the same
network and establish a peer-to-peer telephone PBX configuration. So,
it's a pretty well-rounded SIP phone.
</p><p>
After hanging up with the support technician, I decided to watch
some TV&mdash;IPTV, that is. Accessing the IPTV feature is easy using the
on-screen menu. Once activated, the IPTV feature displays a list of
available channels. A channel is selected by pressing the up and down
buttons on the phone and then by pressing the OK button to begin
viewing. The color display is simply stunning! I watched a soccer game on
the unit; the field looked green, and the players didn't. Flesh tones
were realistic. Motion was smooth without any hint of ghosting.
Once in a while, I noticed some video artifacts, but that probably
was due to bandwidth limitations or packet loss.
</p><p>
Using the built-in PVR function is much like programming a VCR. You select
the date, time and channel, and at the designated time, the system 
either can switch to that channel and allow you to view the program or 
record the program for later viewing.
</p><p>
After changing channels to watch Shakira do her thing for a while,
I decided to check out the M20's streaming audio feature. Streaming
audio works about like you'd expect and sounds as good as most of the
small radios people bring to work. But, that's where the
three RCA plugs (both audio and video) on the side of the unit come into
play. The M20 can be connected to standard AV equipment allowing you to
take advantage of the bigger screen and better (amplified) speakers you
probably already own. I easily could see using this unit, connected to
The Big Amp in the living room, to play streaming music at parties
or while we worked around the house. In my experience, Internet radio
stations tend to play better music than over-the-air radio stations,
so this would be a great thing to have at the home or office.
</p><p>
Any time I see a device with a USB port on it, it piques my interest, and
the M20 was no exception. Once I plugged a pendrive in to the port,
located on the back of the device, I was able to play any MP3, AVI
or MPEG file on the drive as though it were a streaming media source. I
was a little dismayed to discover that plugging in a USB keyboard would
crash the phone. USB keyboard support might have been nice for some of
the messaging features discussed later.
</p><p>
The Owner's Manual indicates that the phone can scan the network for
open shares that contain music and video files. I wasn't able to test
that feature in time for this article, but you can bet I will soon, and
the configuration options indicate that this should be fairly easy to do.
</p><p>
I really like reading news via RSS. Usually, you get a lot of diverse
headlines and just enough summary information to let you determine
whether the
article is interesting enough to read in depth. However, this function
on the M20 points out its two biggest weaknesses. First, the font is
small and sometimes difficult to read. It is readable, but it takes
some time to get used to it. But, the biggest problem comes from the
fact that if you see a news headline you want to read more fully,
you can't, because the M20 doesn't have a Web browser. Now, I understand
that it's asking a lot to embed a Web browser in a telephone, but the
newsreader feature just screams for it.
</p><p>
The M20 has a weather function that displays the local weather forecast
for the next four days. Having gone through all of the configuration
options, I'm not sure how this function works. I suspect that the weather
information is pushed to the phone from a central server. Other minor
services worth mentioning include a stock tracker, currency converter
and, yes, as I noted earlier, a calculator.
The M20 also has e-mail, instant messaging and SMS messaging features.
</p><p>
I wasn't able to test the e-mail capability directly, as the unit
supports only the POP protocol, and my Courier POP server didn't want
to cooperate. However, explaining this feature is fairly easy. Once
properly configured, the M20 can be used to check a user's
e-mail quickly. The M20 doesn't support sending or replying to e-mail,
only
reading it. Now, at first, this may not seem like a very useful feature,
but imagine rushing into your office on your way to an 8:00am meeting and
using your telephone to skim your incoming e-mail quickly to check for any
important messages. Now, imagine being able to do this in less time than
it takes your PC even to boot up. How I wish the unit supported IMAP,
but it would be worthwhile for me to configure a POP server just to use
this feature.
</p><p>
Because the M20 lacks a keyboard, the IM function seems like it would be
a bit cumbersome. But, as the unit supports ICQ, MSN, AOL and SMS
messaging, it's very much worth mentioning. The initial configuration of
the IM client is done via a Web browser. Once configured, you can send
and receive instant messages on any of the supported networks. Sending
a message involves using the phone keyboard to type messages, just like
you would to send an SMS message on a cell phone.
</p><p>
So, as you can see, the M20 packs a lot of features in one little
footprint. But, how well is it supported? As part of this evaluation,
I had intended to contrive a fictional, yet plausible, problem with
the unit and call SysMaster's tech-support line. Fortunately for me,
the unit arrived misconfigured, and I had a perfect opportunity to visit
with one of SysMaster's support technicians.
</p><p>
I already had determined that the SIP password had been misconfigured,
but I let the technician guide me through resolving the problem, which he
did in a logical progression&mdash;all the while exhorting various features
of the device that he thought I may not have been aware of. He obviously
knew the equipment and the technology. I was relieved not to be talking
to someone who was simply reading a script.
</p><p>
As you might imagine with a device as sophisticated as this, configuration
is everything. Sadly, very little of this configuration is exposed via
the built-in video screen. Almost all of the configuration is done with a
Web browser via HTTP. Because the Web-based administration console didn't
work with Konqueror, I had to use my second choice, Mozilla Firefox,
which worked well. At least I didn't have to resort to some other buggy
browser. The administration console wasn't as straightforward as I would
have wished. There is a lot of configurability in this device, but in
my opinion, it isn't well organized.
</p><p>
So, despite a few quirks here and there, this is an amazing device. The M20
brings video, voice and text communications together in one convenient
platform. Wireless, as well as LAN connectivity, plus its adherence
to open standards, allows the M20 to be deployed just about anywhere.
