SSH tunnels can be used to connect securely to a server behind a
firewall in such a way that the firewall can't observe the data. This is
also true and useful if you know an attacker has gained control of the
firewall.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0f580.0x1e07250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Recently at our local (Phoenix) Free Software Stammtisch, we were talking about
security. I was surprised to find that no one else realized you can 
<tt  >ssh</tt> safely across a compromised host to another machine behind it.
A common example of &ldquo;crossing&rdquo; a host to get to another machine is accessing
a machine on a private network protected by a firewall.
The firewall is on the edge of the private network and provides the only
means to get to the private network. So, you have to pass
through the firewall to get to the private network.
</p><p>
But, what happens if the firewall has (or you believe it has) been
compromised?
How do you get to the private network without more security
problems?
It turns out that the answer is the same. You go through the firewall, but you do
it in such a way that your connection remains secure even when the firewall
itself may no longer be.
The connection to the machine on the private network still can be made
securely,
even if you know the host you're passing through has been compromised and
some rogue element has taken control of it.
</p><p>
As an example, let's say you need to connect from your Netbook to a
server on your work's network. Let's also say the only way to get to your
server is via a connection to your work's SSH/VPN gateway, but you think
someone has broken into the gateway
(yes, yes, get it off-line as soon as possible, but let's do that,
and continue to be able to work and recover the gateway).
</p><p>
Now, let's consider an example scenario with three machines, named corresponding
to what they are: Netbook, Gateway and Server.
If you already understand SSH tunneling and want the short story,
see the Short Story sidebar.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0f580.0x1e07618"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Short Story</b></p><p>
The short description is that you initiate a connection to Gateway.
With that connection, you create a tunnel to port 22 on Server using the
-L option to ssh:

<pre     class="programlisting">
-L $local_port:Server:22
</pre>
</p><p>
You then can connect to a local port on Netbook
that is the entry point for a tunnel that comes out at port 22 of the
destination machine, which is Server. The tunneled connection is never
decrypted on Gateway, so it stays secure.
</p></div><p>
For the long story, let's start with a description of some simple tunneling.
The -L option on the command line allows you to create a tunnel:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -N -f -L 2222:localhost:22 Gateway
</pre>
</p><p>
The -L option allows you to specify the entry and exit points for a secure tunnel
created by SSH. In the examples used in this article, it gets an argument
that has three fields. The fields are separated by colons. The first field
is the local port to bind (the local port to listen on). The next field is
the host to connect to. This field is interpreted by the remote machine
in the SSH connection, not by the local machine.
The computer initiating the SSH connection doesn't need to know how to get to it.
The third field is the port to connect to on the far end of the tunnel.
</p><p>
If you run this first command from Netbook, the command creates an SSH connection to Gateway
and builds a tunnel that forwards port 2222 on Netbook to port 22 (the standard SSH port)
on Gateway. The local port, 2222, can be almost any value as long as it's not
already in use, although it must be above 1023 if you're not connecting as root.
Now you can connect to SSH on Gateway by using that tunnel.
Again, it's important to note that the tunnel destination hostname (the second field)
is interpreted by Gateway, so &ldquo;localhost&rdquo; is instructing
Gateway to connect to itself.
localhost is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> Netbook; it's Gateway.
For more examples of using -L to create tunnels, see the SSH -L Examples
sidebar.
</p><p>
The -N and -f options are useful when just creating a tunnel and not
needing a remote shell. The -N option tells SSH not to run a remote
command. The -f option puts the ssh command in the background, so you can
regain control of the shell that ran the ssh command.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0f580.0x1e07b40"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
SSH -L Examples</b></p><p>
The following command connects to remote_host and builds a tunnel from port 8888
of your desktop to port 80 of my Web server.
You then can point a Web browser at http://localhost:8888/ to read my home
page:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -L 8888:www.LuftHans.com:80 remote_host
</pre>
</p><p>
The following command connects to remote_host and builds a tunnel from port 9993
of your desktop to port 993 of mail_server's IMAP over SSL server. You 
then can configure your mail client to connect to port 9993 on your local system to
read your mail:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -L 9993:mail_server:993 remote_host
</pre>
</p><p>
In both cases, the remote servers see the connection coming from
remote_host, and in both cases, it doesn't matter whether your desktop
can talk directly to the server at the far end of the tunnel.
</p></div><p>
Now, run the following command on Netbook:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -p 2222 localhost
</pre>
</p><p>
This second command creates an SSH
connection to port 22 on Gateway by using the tunnel created in the first
command. In the second command, localhost is the destination machine, so
it's interpreted by the SSH client on Netbook, which means the ssh command
running on Netbook connects to Netbook but on a nonstandard port.
The tunnel is entered at port 2222 on Netbook and comes out at port 22
on Gateway. Because sshd is listening on port 22, the tunnel connects to the
SSH d&aelig;mon on Gateway.
</p><p>
Presuming Gateway can connect to Server even though Netbook can't
(remember Server is &ldquo;firewalled&rdquo; behind Gateway),
it's also possible to create a tunnel to Server using a command
such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -a -N -f -L 3333:Server:22 Gateway
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, the tunnel from port 3333 on Netbook doesn't connect to
Gateway, rather it connects to port 22 on Server. Gateway is essentially
forwarding packets from Netbook to Server. Like the first command, the
tunnel destination (the second field, <tt  >Server</tt>) is interpreted by Gateway,
so this tunnel connects to Server.
Netbook doesn't need to know how to get to Server; Gateway handles the routing.
</p><p>
The -a option here makes sure authentication agent connections are not forwarded
to Gateway. If you are concerned that Gateway is compromised,
you don't want the attacker to gain control of your authentication agent connections.
For more, see the Authentication Agents sidebar.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0f580.0x1e081c8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Authentication Agents</b></p><p>
An authentication agent holds authentication credentials and allows
other processes to use it for authenticating with SSH servers. It
can be used for an X session allowing various commands and shells to
authenticate automagically when logging in to remote services.
</p><p>
Authentication agents also can pass credentials on to remote servers
allowing the remote shell to use it.
The following command will connect to hostB and forward the authentication agent
connection if you have one established:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -A hostB
</pre>
</p><p>
If hostC allows authentication with the same key, you then
can <tt  >ssh</tt> from
hostB to hostC without having to authenticate manually.
</p><p>
A couple risks are involved in this type of authentication
agent forwarding. In the example in the article, the risk is that if you
forward the authentication agent connection to Gateway from Netbook, the
attacker also could gain access to that authentication agent connection. If
Server accepts the same key, the attacker could use your authentication
agent connection to establish a connection to Server.
</p><p>
Another issue is that the authentication agent will forward all
keys that it has. If you use one key for customerA and another key for
customerB, you don't want the agent to forward the key for customerA
to customerB's machine.
</p></div><p>
Figure 1 displays the example graphically.
The initial ssh command builds the SSH connection for
the tunnel, the tunneled connection and the forwarded connection.
The second ssh command initiates a new connection through the tunnel and
forwards the connection directly to the machine you are trying to reach.
The forwarded connection is in red to show that it is unencrypted,
but the blue SSH connection going through it is secure.

Figure 1. Tunneling across a Compromised Host
(Brian Cluff, <a href="mailto:LJ2009@Macrosift.com">LJ2009@Macrosift.com</a>, created the image for
this article.)
</p></div></div><p>
This tunnel could work for any TCP protocol, but the packets from
Gateway to Server and back to Gateway are unencrypted.
That means unencrypted services would not be secure between Gateway
and Server, even though you're using an SSH tunnel.
You may want to review the -L option section of the SSH man page and
consider this a bit to convince yourself that the Server/Gateway connection
(the red part in Figure 1) is unencrypted.
Anything that isn't secure or that gets decrypted on Gateway can be read
by the attacker if the attacker has root access on Gateway.
The attacker also can read much of that simply by having
access to your account on Gateway even without root access on Gateway.
</p><p>
Before connecting to the tunnel, you need to make sure you have Server's
host public key registered as a key for localhost. If you tried to pull the public
key out of Gateway's known_hosts file, the attacker can give you a bogus
key, so you need to get the key another way.
</p><p>
Therefore, it's best to have Server's public key already. If you don't
already have the public key, make sure to acquire it or the fingerprint
for the key from a secure, trusted source. For instance, you could list
the SSH key fingerprints for all of your servers on a secure Web page.
</p><p>
I suggest registering Server's public key in your known_hosts file
under the real server name as well as under localhost. By registering
under the real server name, you can figure out to which server a key belongs
with the ssh-keygen command.
</p><p>
The following command checks your $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts file for a public
key for Server. The command also reports the line number for the entry:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh-keygen -F Server
</pre>
</p><p>
The entry then can be copied. By replacing the hostname portion of the
copied entry with localhost, you create an entry for that key on localhost.
See the Obtaining the Public Key sidebar for information on how to
obtain a server's public key securely.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0f580.0x1e08b10"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Obtaining the Public Key</b></p><p>
The public key for a host is usually in either
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub or /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub, depending
on the type of key the host uses. You also can get the public key out of
the known_hosts file of a computer you can trust. For instance, if you
normally connect to the server from your work desktop, you could copy the
entry for server out of your work desktop's known_hosts file.
</p><p>
Your site also might publish SSH public keys or public key fingerprints
via a secure Web page or via DNS entries.
</p></div><p>
If your known_hosts file has hostnames that look like the keys,
you have hashed hostnames. Use the -H option to ssh-keygen to hash your
new localhost entry.
The following command translates plain-text hostnames in your known_hosts
file to hashed hostname entries:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh-keygen -H
</pre>
</p><p>
Now with the tunnel set up, you can connect to SSH on Server, and because it's an
SSH connection, it's encrypted:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -p 3333 localhost
</pre>
</p><p>
Again, localhost here is from Netbook's perspective, so that command
connects to port 3333 on Netbook. The last SSH &ldquo;tunnel&rdquo; command created a
tunnel from that port over to the SSH port on Server via
Gateway&mdash;meaning
that this command uses the tunnel to connect to Server's SSH server
via port 3333 on Netbook.
</p><p>
Even though the tunnel passes through Gateway, it is unreadable by
Gateway. Just as SSH connections normally travel across untrustable
routers, yet are secure, the connection through Gateway to Server is
secure. The SSH connection via the tunnel is never unencrypted on Gateway,
so the attacker can't compromise it.
But again, remember to have verified the host key for Server already, or the
attacker can compromise the connection with a man-in-the-middle attack.
</p><p>
With the connection to Server, you now could set up a SOCKS proxy to allow
applications running on Netbook to be effectively on your work's network.
See the SOCKS Proxy sidebar for more information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0f580.0x2201288"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
SOCKS Proxy</b></p><p>
OpenSSH can set up a SOCKS tunnel when called with the -D option
to contact services on Server.
</p><p>
One example would be to use the FoxyProxy add-on for Firefox to direct
requests for Intranet servers to use the SOCKS tunnel. The http requests
then would be sent from Server and would be able to contact Web servers on the
Intranet. One such server could be a trouble-ticketing system to allow you
to report that Gateway has been compromised.
</p><p>
The following command, when given on Netbook, would use the tunnel to Server by
connecting to port 3333 on localhost and then create a SOCKS proxy on port
1080 of Netbook:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -p 3333 -D 1080 localhost
</pre>
</p><p>
FoxyProxy then could be configured to proxy Intranet requests via port
1080 on localhost.
</p></div><p>
If Netbook has a public IP, you also can set up a reverse tunnel from
Server to Netbook. The reverse tunnel allows you to connect to Netbook
from Server and then connect back to Server via the reverse tunnel. If the
reverse tunnel doesn't need to go through Gateway, you then could take Gateway
down for investigation and repair while still being connected to the
internal network.
See the Reverse SSH Tunnel sidebar for more information about reverse tunnels.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0f580.0x22016a8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Reverse SSH Tunnel</b></p><p>
A reverse tunnel is just like the tunnel we set up with -L, except it
allows the destination machine to connect to the client machine.
</p><p>
In the example from this article, you can create a reverse tunnel from
Server to Netbook allowing Netbook to reconnect to Server.
The following command, when run from Server, connects to Netbook and creates a
tunnel from port 4444 on Netbook to the SSH d&aelig;mon on Server. Any shell on
Netbook then can connect to Server via port 4444:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -R 4444:localhost:22 Netbook
</pre>
</p><p>
The following command, when run from Netbook, would connect to Server via the
reverse tunnel:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -p 4444 localhost
</pre>
</p><p>
If the outbound connections from Server don't go out via Gateway, the
reverse tunnel can be used even after Gateway is shut down.
</p><p>
I suggest running the SSH command from within a screen session on
Server to make sure the controlling shell doesn't exit.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d0f580.0x2201ac8"></a>
Review</h2></div></div><p>
Connect to your possibly compromised machine, Gateway, and create a
tunnel to the machine you ultimately want to reach, Server.
Once the tunnel is up, use it to connect to SSH on Server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ssh -a -N -f -L 3333:Server:22 Gateway
ssh -P 3333 localhost
</pre>
</p><p>
Reminders:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Don't forget to block authentication agent forwarding.
</p></li><li><p>
Don't forget to specify remote user names if you need them.
</p></li><li><p>
Use a port above 1023 if you're not connecting as root.
</p></li><li><p>
Make sure to have confirmed SSH host keys previously.
</p></li><li><p>
Add the host key to your known_hosts file as an entry for
localhost, because SSH will see the connection as being to localhost.
</p></li><li><p>
Use -D to create a SOCKS proxy.
</p></li><li><p>
None of the commands in this article require root access.
All would work from your own account.
</p></li><li><p>
The attacker can block the connection and can control the connection to
Gateway, but the attacker can't compromise the connection to Server.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Any SSH connection across the Internet is crossing questionable hosts/routers.
If those were safe, you wouldn't need a secured connection.
The tunnel is the same scenario, because it's just enabling a normal SSH
connection.
