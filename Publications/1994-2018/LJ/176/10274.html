Promise Technology's SuperTrak EX16650 16-Port RAID Controller</h2></div></div><p>
Promise Technology stresses comprehensive Linux support on its new 16-Port
RAID Controller, the SuperTrak EX16650. The EX16650 and the rest of
the SuperTrak EX RAID controller family now officially supports more
than
15 different Linux kernel distributions in addition to the company's
open-source Linux drivers. The devices also now have native
&ldquo;inbox&rdquo; driver
support in all major Linux distributions. The EX16650 provides 16 ports
of SAS/SATA connectivity, eliminating the requirement for a separate
expander in most applications. Promise says the controllers are
ideal for enterprise data solutions, such as enterprise storage servers,
network backup, disk-to-disk backup, security and surveillance, video
editing and digital content creation.

Terracotta</h2></div></div><p>
The open-source Java clustering solution Terracotta has added a tick to
the tenths column, landing at Version 2.7. The makers of Terracotta claim
their application lowers costs and simplifies Web application deployment
by reducing development effort and easing the load on application
servers and databases, making it a solution well suited for scaling
critical applications. Because Terracotta offers &ldquo;the performance of
local memory with the high availability of a database&rdquo;, it eliminates the
&ldquo;unyielding performance and reliability trade-offs that constrain many
Java applications today&rdquo;. Version 2.7 also extends support of the Spring
framework and the Glassfish application server, plus features that enhance
scalability, performance and operational visibility.

Ravi Kothuri and Albert Godfrind's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pro Oracle Spatial for Oracle Database
11g</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Apress is venturing into the under-published topic of geospatial data
management with its new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pro Oracle Spatial for Oracle
Database 11g</em></span>,
by authors Ravi Kothuri and Albert Godfrind. The book is targeted at
software developers who want to develop applications using Oracle's
extensive built-in support for working with spatial, or geocoded, data.
The book addresses issues such as the special nature of spatial data
and its role in professional and consumer applications; the modeling,
storing, accessing and analyzing of spatial data; the Oracle Spatial
solution and the integration of spatial data into enterprise databases;
and how spatial information is used to understand business and support
decisions. Other topics include the SDO_GEOMETRY data type, geocoding
of data, map creation, network modeling and optimizing analysis of
spatial data.

Matthew Scarpino's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming the Cell Processor</em></span> (Prentice-Hall)</h2></div></div><p>
The Cell processor is the linchpin that enables the world's fastest
supercomputer, IBM's Roadrunner, so it likely will add wings to
your application too. Matthew Scarpino's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming
the Cell Processor</em></span>, published by Prentice-Hall, shows how to create
applications that harness the power of IBM's powerful Cell processor.
Oriented toward game developers, graphics programmers and engineers,
the book covers everything from the Cell's advanced architecture to its
tools and libraries, presenting code examples that help you gain a
deep understanding of Cell development. Topics include mastering the
Cell SDK, understanding Cell's PPU, programming the Synergistic Processor
Unit and more.

site, Sothink hopes you'll choose its new solution, Video
Encoder Engine for Adobe Flash, to do so. This Linux-based encoder can
convert nearly any popular video format to FLV and can be utilized on
Web servers, blogs, forums and other interactive sites. The product
also enables advanced video editing, batch conversion, quality control
and other tasks with CGI or any other server-side scripting language.
A demo video hosting site, complete with source code and written in PHP,
is included. Other functions include full control of video and audio
quality and characteristics.

Astaro's Mail Gateway</h2></div></div><p>
Astaro offers that its new Mail Gateway appliance trumps its competitors
by being &ldquo;the only security vendor that provides e-mail encryption free
with its mail gateway solution&rdquo;. Targeted at small- to medium-size
businesses, the Mail Gateway also features virus protection and remote
exchange access and runs transparently at the gateway to eliminate need
for employee action. Removing individual employees from the encryption
process, says Astaro, significantly lowers the chance that confidential
data may be sent accidentally in plain text across the Internet. Astaro's
encryption is based on standards, such as S/MIME, OpenPGP and TLS,
and allows for scanning of encrypted e-mail for malware. In addition,
Astaro's solution complements traditional antispam technologies with
reputation-based filtering.
