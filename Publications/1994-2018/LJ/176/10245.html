You are always on the Internet, so why shouldn't your GPS be? Read
on for a review of the Dash Express GPRS-connected GPS system.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad5580.0xbcd300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I spend a lot of time in my car. Like a fair number of people who work in
the San Francisco Bay Area, I commute a long distance&mdash;in my case, 60 miles
one way. I've learned to time my commute to avoid the worst of the traffic,
but I still spend about three hours each day in my car. I've tried
different GPS (Global Positioning System) units here and there, but because
most of my time in the car is spent going to the same place, I don't
typically need a lot of driving directions. A GPS would sit unused
only until I travel or go to a new restaurant, which is only every once in
a while. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad5580.0xbcd4b8"></a>
Introduction to the Dash Express</h2></div></div><p>
Now, I like gadgets at least as much as the next Linux geek, so when I first
heard about the Dash Express GPS, I instantly was intrigued. Basically, Dash
has created a new GPS unit aimed at the commuter market. This GPS adds a
GPRS cellular connection, so that it has an always-on Internet connection
while you drive. The Internet connection can be used to get new software
updates and maps, but one of the main selling points for the Internet
connection is improved traffic, routing and search data. The Dash network
keeps track of each GPS unit anonymously and combines its data with
traffic sensors and other data points to gauge up-to-the-minute traffic
data it then shares with each Dash user.
</p><p>
The Internet connection also allows the Dash Express to source other
Internet services when you do a search. Along with the built-in database of
locations of interest, you also can search Yahoo for anything from the
closest coffee shop to the best sushi place nearby, as Yahoo searches not
only return locations but also ratings for each result.
</p><p>
One of the most interesting aspects of the Dash for me and other
Linux users is the open-source nature of the device. For one, the hardware
itself runs Linux. The hardware is actually similar to what is being used
in the OpenMoko cellphones. In addition, Dash has opened its API, so
interested parties can register as developers and write their own
applications to run on the Dash Express. Later in this review, I talk
about my own experience writing a Dash application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad5580.0xbcd6c8"></a>
Pricing</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, the GPS unit and cellular connection aren't free. The Dash
Express currently retails for $299 and includes three months of free
cellular connection. After that, the cellular connection costs $12.99 with
a month-to-month contract, $10.99 per month with a one-year contract and
$9.99 per month with a two-year contract. If you choose not to renew the
cellular connection, the unit still functions like a standard GPS, but you
no longer will be able to use Send2Car, Dash applications, Yahoo searches
and other features that require the Internet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad5580.0xbcd7d0"></a>
Standard GPS Functions</h2></div></div><p>
Although the Internet features might seem cool, a GPS device still needs to be
able to find your destinations and route you there correctly. Plus, if you
don't renew the cellular connection, you'd like to know that the device
still would be useful. First, though, let me point out the elephant in the
room. One of the first things you will notice about the Dash Express is
that it is <span   class="emphasis"><em>big</em></span> compared to other modern GPS devices
(4.8"Wx4.1"Hx2.8"D and 13.3 ounces). Although the face of the device is about
the same size as other devices, it's as thick as the Garmin GPSes from a few
generations ago. Along with its thickness, the top of the device actually
extends back a few inches in a sort of L shape and houses the speaker.
Unfortunately, this means you won't be storing the Dash Express in your
pocket or possibly even in a small glove compartment.
</p><p>
The installation is pretty straightforward, and out of the box, the device
will connect to a cellular network (or open Wi-Fi access point) for any
Internet features. The interface itself is simplified compared to some
other GPS units and relies almost entirely on the touchscreen for input,
apart from a physical menu and volume button on the top of the device. When
you calculate a route, you will see and hear turn-by-turn directions from
the main map screen. The interface is pretty clean (Figure 1) with most of
the screen taken up by the map.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10245f1.large.jpg"><img src="10245f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Dash Express Interface
</p></div></div><p>
As a standalone GPS, the Dash is so-so. A few times I searched for a
business only to find that when I got there it was out of business. The
routing isn't entirely perfect either and seems to favor larger
highways and more direct routes, even if they are slower. My town has four
different exits on the highway, but even though the first exit is the
fastest, the Dash always routed through a different exit. There is a
particularly bad bottleneck along my commute that occasionally backs up for
miles. There's an alternate route to my house right before the bottleneck
that normally takes longer except when there is very heavy traffic at the
bottleneck, but the Dash seemed unaware of this as an alternate route.
</p><p>
The Dash does appear to be dealing with the routing issues actively. You can
report a problem directly from the device, and it will tar up all of its
logs and other information about your current location and send it off
to Dash via the cell connection. Once you get home, you will see an e-mail
response in your inbox, and you can go to Dash's Web site to fill out the details
of your problem. I did, in fact, report an issue with routing around the
bottleneck, and Dash was quick to respond. Apparently, the next iteration of
its map and routing internally does not have the issue, so presumably my
problem will be fixed at the next update.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad5580.0xbcdbf0"></a>
Connected GPS Functions</h2></div></div><p>
There are a lot of different GPS units from which to choose, but the Dash Express
is the first to include a cellular connection in its device. It really is
the main feature that differentiates it from competitors, so
it's even more important that this extra functionality is
compelling. So, how do the Internet features fare?
</p><p>
When the Dash Express has a cellular signal, you will see the word
connected on the search button at the main menu. Without a cellular
signal, you can perform only local search, and the rest of the search
options are grayed out. When connected, the default input box at the
search window searches Yahoo for keywords you enter. In addition to the
Yahoo searches, there are a number of saved search categories, including
Airports, Food, Gas and Movie Theaters. The Gas and Movie Theater saved
searches make special use of the Internet connection. The Movie Theater
search will not only show you the theaters in your area, but it also will list
the current show times. For the Gas search, each result also includes local
gas prices along with how recently that information was gathered. You also can
sort your results by price, which makes it quick and easy to find
the cheapest gas in your area.
</p><p>
One of the most-touted features of the Internet connection is live traffic
information. As I mentioned before, the Dash anonymously gathers the location
information of all Dash units and combines it with trusted road sensors,
information from commercial fleets and other data sources to create what it
calls the Dash Network. On the main map screen, each street with traffic
data shows up color-coded. Green represents good traffic; yellow indicates slight
congestion; orange, moderate traffic; and red means heavy traffic. In
addition,
the Dash uses solid lines when the traffic information comes from its trusted
Dash Network and dotted lines when the information is from less-trusted
sources. So essentially, if someone else with a Dash Express is on the same
road ahead of me, I can get very accurate traffic information. As you drive
to your destination, if the GPS unit detects traffic ahead, you will get
an alert on your screen with the option to calculate alternate routes.
</p><p>
One of the more straightforward Internet features is Send2Dash. Often one
of the more annoying features of a GPS is typing in an address on the
touchscreen. With Send2Dash, you can log in to a custom portal on the Dash
site, type in an address and then send it to your own Dash, where it will
show up the next time it starts. This makes it nice and easy to build an
address book. There's even a Firefox plugin, so you can highlight an
address and then right-click and select Send to Car.
</p><p>
The Internet-enabled features on the Dash&mdash;specifically the enhanced
searches&mdash;are great features, especially the Gas search. The Yahoo
searches also work well as a supplement and second opinion to the internal
map of destinations. The traffic, however, is a mixed bag. When it's
accurate, it has been a lifesaver. It takes some time and familiarity with
the map to interpret what light, moderate or heavy traffic really means,
and how much weight to give to the dotted less-reliable traffic lines.
Once you figure it out, however, you can search ahead while you commute
and often see problems before they affect you. 
</p><p>
On the downside, traffic information isn't always as &ldquo;live&rdquo; as
I'd like it to be.
I've seen a situation or two where I've been in pretty heavy congestion or
even in stopped traffic a number of minutes before the Dash updates. Of
course,
maybe I'm the traffic canary in the coal mine helping the rest of the
Dash community in the Bay Area. I know that Dash is working on traffic
reporting, but for now, I recommend supplementing the Dash data with
something like the Yahoo Traffic Incidents Dash application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad5580.0xbcdf08"></a>
Dash Apps</h2></div></div><p>
Like Apple with the iPhone, the Dash has allowed third parties to write custom
applications, &ldquo;Dash apps&rdquo;, for use on the device. The applications are
easy to add from Dash's Web portal, and so far, all of them are free. There
are a number of interesting applications, but here are some of the more
notable ones:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Trapster&mdash;search for and report speed traps and red-light cameras along
your route.
</p></li><li><p>
Weatherbug&mdash;weather forecasts for your location or destination.
</p></li><li><p>
Yahoo Traffic Incidents&mdash;accidents or slowdowns along your route.
</p></li><li><p>
Trulia&mdash;local available real-estate with pricing.
</p></li><li><p>
Baktrax&mdash;a list of local radio stations and the last few songs they
played.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
All in all, the Dash apps are one of the more compelling reasons
to have a Dash Express right now. It's these sorts of programs that move
the Dash from a standard GPS to use when you are lost to a GPS you
use on your dashboard every day.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad5580.0xbce4e0"></a>
Developing Dash Apps</h2></div></div><p>
Earlier in the year, the Dash opened up its API to the community, so anyone
could register on its site as a developer and write custom Dash apps.
Since then, the API has been updated and expanded with some new features, and
it still appears to be in active development. Even so, there already seems to
be a pretty active developer community springing up in the Dash forums, and
quite a few community-developed Dash apps are already available on
the site.
</p><p>
I wanted to see how easy it was to develop my own Dash app, so I downloaded
the latest edition of the API documentation, registered as a developer on
the site, and started with a sample PHP program I found on the forum.
Essentially, when you conduct a search with a Dash app, the Dash Express
then sends an HTTP GET to a Web service you specify that contains a few
variables including the Dash's GPS location and potentially a custom value
from a text entry window on the Dash itself. Your Web service replies
back with its results formatted in some basic XML (the structure is defined
in the API documentation) that the Dash then displays. Here's a sample of
the XML output that Dash accepts:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;resultSet&gt;&lt;serviceId&gt;10114&lt;/serviceId&gt;&lt;count&gt;1&lt;/count&gt;
&lt;sort&gt;di&lt;/sort&gt;
&lt;result&gt;&lt;title&gt;Title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;point&gt;38.2440154167-122.6531425&lt;/point&gt;
&lt;description&gt;requestType-&gt;search   serviceId-&gt;10114
point-&gt;38.24401541666667 -122.6531425   count-&gt;20   
offset-&gt;0   sort-&gt;null signature-&gt;ed002f9a2f86013c9affd8d9e1b9f90e   
&lt;/description&gt;&lt;address&gt;12000 San Jose
Blvd&lt;/address&gt;&lt;city&gt;Jacksonville&lt;/city&gt;
&lt;regionCode&gt;FL&lt;/regionCode&gt;&lt;countryCode&gt;US&lt;/countryCode&gt;
&lt;postalCode&gt;32223&lt;/postalCode&gt;&lt;/result&gt;&lt;/resultSet&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
After all these years, I still tend to favor Perl for this sort of thing, so
the first thing I did was port the sample PHP script to Perl. Once I got
that working, I decided to try to write something actually useful. I wasn't
ready to dig heavily into sourcing sites like Google Maps for location
data, so instead, I decided to write something more basic. I planned to
write an application that would take the current mileage as input and then
read from a basic CSV file and report back any maintenance due within plus
or minus 10,000 miles. The first column in the CSV file has the mileage
when the maintenance was due, the second column has a description of the
maintenance, and the third column is optional but had a 1 or 0 depending
on whether the task was completed. Here's some sample lines from the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
151000,Change Oil,1
156000,Change Oil and Filter,1
161000,Change Oil
160000,Replace Tires
180000,Replace Coolant
160000,Replace Air Filter
</pre>
</p><p>
Listing 1 shows the script that reads from the file and outputs the XML
for the Dash.

</pre></div><p>
It's pretty basic, but it works. The whole process from testing the PHP
script to writing the final application took only about two hours. Once you
write the program, you can create a new Dash app instance via an interface
on the my.dash.net site and add it to your saved searches. You also
can choose to keep the program to yourself, or you can make it public so
any Dash user can use it.
</p><p>
The ease of developing applications for the Dash
is a definite plus for me.
There are still some limitations in its API (for instance, there is only
one text box available for user entry at the time of this writing), but the
API still appears to be under heavy development and already has had feature
updates. Even as it is, if you have some imagination and some programming
ability, you can write some pretty useful applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xad5580.0xbceb10"></a>
Hacking the Dash</h2></div></div><p>
Okay, so I couldn't help myself. Here was a device that I knew ran Linux
with not only a GPRS connection, but also a Wi-Fi connection. There had
to be a way to get to a Linux prompt on the thing.
</p><p>
First, I let the Dash associate with my home Wi-Fi and then tried to SSH to
it. It turns out, it actually does have SSH listening; however, I didn't know
the password (if there even were one, I haven't had a chance to attempt SSH
brute-force attacks yet), and it could use SSH keys.
</p><p>
The Dash Express does have a USB port on the side and even comes with a USB
cable to connect it to your computer, but currently, there is no official
use for this port other than charging the battery. When you connect it to
Linux, dmesg gives some hope:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Sep  1 21:53:11 minimus kernel: [ 1447.814648] 
 usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd

 for sub-path usb0.dbus.get.reason
</pre>
</p><p>
So, the device does show up as some sort of USB Ethernet device. Some
research on the Internet led to a page that described how the OpenMoko
phone had a similar connection, but unfortunately, if the Dash Express
assigned itself a static IP, it didn't use the same one as the OpenMoko. I
tried an nmap host discovery on all of the private IP space and even
collected a few minutes of packets from the USB network to see whether there
were any clues there, but as of yet, I haven't been able to get into the
device.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Overall, the Dash Express is a very interesting GPS device. The Linux user
in me wants to root for the underdog, especially if that underdog uses
Linux as the OS on the device. The programmer in me is really drawn to
the open API and the ability to write my own applications on the device and
use the applications from a community of developers. The commuter in me
likes a device aimed at delivering accurate traffic data. The gadget geek
in me likes the concept of adding an Internet connection to a GPS device
and is really interested in the potential that sort of improvement brings.
</p><p>
When it comes down to it, potential is the keyword for the Dash Express.
Today, the Dash is a very useful GPS product with some advanced search
features and Dash apps that no other competitor has&mdash;it just has some rough
edges in some of the more fundamental GPS functions. It's the overall
potential of the platform that is most compelling to me. I know that the
rough parts are being worked on actively, and in the meantime, the community
has added some great new free features to the device. As long as Dash can
stay responsive to its users and especially to its developers (and maybe
give us Linux geeks a peek under the hood), I think it's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>the</em></span> GPS for geeks.
