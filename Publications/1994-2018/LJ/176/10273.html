Ah, gadgets. I remember back in 1996, the Palm Pilot came out and promised
to streamline our schedules in such a way that we easily could get our
daily work accomplished in half the time it normally took. (Yes, I realize
the Apple Newton and several others offered similar features earlier, but
it was the Palm Pilot that really took the world by storm&mdash;at least, my
world.) The funny thing was that while the organization and portability
of the Palm did in fact allow us to accomplish more in less time, the end
result wasn't lots of free time and afternoons on the beach. Instead, we
crammed more duties into an already-cramped day. It's been more than a decade
since the Palm Pilot was introduced, and we're still using gadget after
gadget to cram more and more activities into our lives. The good news is
at least some of the gadgets cram <span   class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span> into our lives as well as work.
</p><p>
If you're a Linux fan, as we here at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> obviously are, gadgets
can be a double-edged sword. Although many, if not most, gadgets run some
sort of Linux as their operating system, those very gadgets often are not
designed to interface with a Linux desktop environment! Thankfully, many
of them work with Linux&mdash;either by design or by hack&mdash;and this
month, we
talk a bit about both.
</p><p>
One device, the BlackBerry, doesn't run Linux as its operating system. It
also doesn't support syncing with a Linux desktop. Like so many other
hardware devices, the Linux community has wedged the BlackBerry into the
list of supported devices, in spite of the RIM corporation. Carl Fink
shows us all the gory details. Cory Wright takes us to the other end of
the spectrum and shows us the OpenMoko Neo FreeRunner phone. This little
beauty is open from the word go, and of course, it runs Linux. Cory tells us
the ups, the downs and the potential future for a phone that makes other
&ldquo;Linux-friendly&rdquo; phones seem clich&eacute;.
</p><p>
Some gadgets don't even need computer interaction. The Dash Express GPS,
for example, is an in-car GPS system that connects to the Internet all by
itself. It runs Linux, and with its on-line access, could prove to be an
amazingly powerful navigation tool. Luckily, our own Kyle Rankin has one,
and he tells us all about it. Another Linux-running gadget that doesn't
need any help getting on-line is Amazon's Kindle. Daniel Bartholomew tells
us all about his and gives us the nitty-gritty regarding viewable content,
DRM and the &ldquo;free&rdquo; EVDO Internet access.
</p><p>
Technology keeps shrinking and shrinking. Although my Palm Pilot back in
1996
was fairly limited in what it could do, nowadays, a device like the Nokia
Internet Tablet isn't much bigger&mdash;but boy is it more powerful. Bill
Childers shows us how to hack around with a Nokia, and Jes Hall shows us
the Acer Aspire One. Granted it's a bit larger than your standard gadget,
but the Aspire One can barely be called a laptop. Along with the Eee PC,
the MSI Wind, the HP Mini-Note and a slew of others, it fits into that
little space of devices called Netbooks. Jes tells us all about the one
she's been using and how its features stack up.
</p><p>
For some power users, gadgets are just silly. Those folks will likely want
to read this month's review of Terra Soft's PowerStation. It's a PPC-based
workstation unlike anything you've seen. Luckily, those power users can
still get &ldquo;gadgets&rdquo; of their own, of the software variety.
Marcel Gagn&eacute;
shows us a handful of software goodies that, although tough to stuff into your
pocket, will fit on your desktop easily.
</p><p>
And yes, even if gadgets aren't your thing at all, we have our regular cast
of columnists writing on the topics you know and love. Reuven M. Lerner
shows us how to speed up database transactions with memcached; Mick Bauer
continues his series on Samba security; Dave Taylor finishes off his series
on the FilmBuzz Trivia program; plus lots, lots more. So, whip out your
Palm Pilot and schedule time to read this issue. You won't be
disappointed.
