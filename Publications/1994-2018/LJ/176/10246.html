Why limit yourself to searching for messages within one folder in
mutt? You are a few short shell scripts away from multifolder searching
bliss.

If you didn't already know, I'm a mutt-addict^H^H^H^H^Huser. At this
point, I can't even remember when I started using mutt. All I do know is
that every time I try another mail client, I just get frustrated by how
long it takes to go through my e-mail. Well, that, plus try to navigate
a GUI e-mail program with vi key bindings&mdash;it (usually) doesn't work.
</p><p>
Why try other mail clients if I love mutt so much? Well for one, some
of the other mail clients do have a few interesting features, such as
virtual folders. With a virtual folder, you can create a keyword
search, and then all messages that match the search end up in a special
folder you can browse. Well, it turns out, the same functionality
is available in mutt if you use maildirs and are willing to do a little
scripting.
</p><p>
One major problem with the default search abilities in mutt is that
you can search within only one folder at a time. I store just about
everything that's important in e-mail, and I have many different folders
with even more procmail rules to sort incoming mail between them. The
downside to this is occasionally I can't remember exactly in which
folder a particular e-mail message is located.
</p><p>
The solution to the mutt search problem takes advantage of the fact that
if you use maildirs on your mail server, each folder is a directory on
the server, and each e-mail message is a file within that directory.
Basically,
a script can go through each of your folders and grep for your
keyword and then create a new maildir with symlinks to any matching
files. I named my solution maildirsearch, and it looks something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

MAILDIRS="$HOME/mail"
VFOLDER="search"
VFOLDERPATH="$MAILDIRS/$VFOLDER/cur/"
FOLDERS=`ls $MAILDIRS | egrep -v "search|flagged"`

rm -f $VFOLDERPATH/*

for i in $FOLDERS
do 
   for j in `egrep -lR "$@"  $MAILDIRS/$i`
   do
      ln -s $j $VFOLDERPATH/;
   done;
done;
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, I created another script called muttsearch that would execute my
maildirsearch script, then open a new instance of mutt that reads the
new virtual search folder. One nice feature of using this method is
that I can see the search results grow within the mutt window and start
reviewing results immediately:


<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh

VFOLDER="search"
$HOME/bin/maildirsearch "$@" &amp;
sleep 1;
mutt -f "=$VFOLDER" &amp;&amp; killall maildirsearch &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, I set up a key binding in mutt so that I could press Esc-S, type
in a keyword (or regex) and start the search:

<pre     class="programlisting">

macro index \eS "&lt;shell-escape&gt;$HOME/bin/muttsearch \""
macro browser \eS "&lt;shell-escape&gt;$HOME/bin/muttsearch \""

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, there is a downside to this script&mdash;it's designed to be run on the
server that stores the messages. In my case, I use a tool called offlineimap
to sync my remote e-mail server with my laptop, so I always have a copy of
my messages locally. If you don't want to go that route, but want to
be able to search from your local machine, you potentially could modify
my muttsearch script so that it SSHes into your mail server and executes
the script.
</p><p>
The script actually works well for me, but I realized after some time that
I did a lot of the same searches over and over again. For instance, I am
a heavy user of the &ldquo;flag for follow-up&rdquo; function in mutt. If you are in
the message index and press the F key, it sets a flag on the message
and displays an exclamation point in front of it. I use this to remind
myself that I need to reply to a message. The downside to this is that I
have to go to a particular folder regularly to see the flag, and sometimes
I want to see all of my flagged messages at once. It turns out that the
same virtual folder concept I used for my search works well for this too.
</p><p>
First, I created a script called flag-folder. When you flag an e-mail
in a maildir system, the e-mail gets an F added after the last comma
in the filename. Basically, my flag-folder script searches through all
my maildirs for files that match the pattern and then symlinks those
files into a new maildir named flagged:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

# This script finds all the flagged e-mail in a 
# Maildir and symlinks them to a 'flagged' folder 
# in the Maildir. 
# To run it every 5 minutes, for instance, add the 
# following to the user's crontab:
#
#       */5 *    * * *   /home/greenfly/bin/flag-folder

MAILDIR="$HOME/mail/"      # path to your maildir
FLAGGED="${MAILDIR}/flagged/cur" # path to your 
                                 # (precreated) flagged folder

cd $FLAGGED
rm ${FLAGGED}/*

# find all the files in the maildir, then search for 
# flagged files (files with an F after the last comma 
# in the filename) and symlink them
find ${MAILDIR} -type f | perl -ne '$foo = ""; $foo = 
 &#8618;(split ",", $_)[-1] if(/,/); if($foo =~ /F/){chomp; 
 &#8618;system "ln -s $_ .\n";}'
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see in the comments in the script, you also simply can set
this up as a cron job on your mail server so that your flagged folder is
updated constantly. Then, I created a script similar to my muttsearch
script called muttflag that basically does the same functions, except for
the flag-folder script:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/sh

VFOLDER="flagged"
$HOME/bin/flag-folder &amp;
sleep 1;
mutt -f "=$VFOLDER";

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, I created another key binding so that pressing Esc-F executes the muttflag
script:

<pre     class="programlisting">

macro index \eF "&lt;shell-escape&gt;$HOME/bin/muttflag \n"
macro browser \eF "&lt;shell-escape&gt;$HOME/bin/muttflag \n"

</pre>
</p><p>
There are a lot of other possibilities when you use virtual folders
in mutt. So far, the only big downside I have found is that because
the script uses symlinks, any flags applied to messages within virtual
folders don't apply to the real message. For instance, if you reply to a
message within a virtual folder, it updates the filename for the symlink,
but not the file it links to. Essentially, this means you lose that
reply flag unless you go to the original folder and reply.
</p><p>
Apart from the downsides though, I'm pretty happy with virtual folders
in mutt. Once again, it's faster than searches I've seen in other clients,
plus I get to keep my vi key bindings, which you can have when you pry
them from my cold, dead IBM Model M keyboard.
