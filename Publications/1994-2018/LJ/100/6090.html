the steady stream of new devices coming to fruition, it certainly
is. In this month's column, we learn of an incursion by Tux into

Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a webcam has been installed for
the first time at the North Pole&mdash;one that runs on embedded Linux,
no less. The device was installed on April 28, 2002 and is logging
four images a day&mdash;take a look at NOAA's web site:
<a href="http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/gallery_np.html" target="_self">www.arctic.noaa.gov/gallery_np.html</a>.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6090f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. North Pole NetCam</p></div></div>
</p><p>The webcam's images will track the North Pole snow cover,
weather conditions and the status of NOAA's Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory's North Pole instrumentation, according to
James Overland, head of NOAA's North Pole Project.</p><p>Although the webcam is capable of transmitting camera video
at the rate of one image per second, NOAA keeps the device powered
off most of the time in order to conserve its solar-charged battery
power. Four times a day the webcam wakes up, places a phone call
via the Iridium low Earth orbit satellite system and transfers the
latest images at 2,400 baud to NOAA's servers using PPP.</p><p>The webcam being used is the NetCam from StarDot
Technologies, a 20-person company located in Buena Park,
California. StarDot created their first webcam design in 1996,
developed a custom digital camera control chip in 1997 and went on
to sell over 65,000 webcams based on that design (manufactured by a
Taiwanese partner and imported to the US by StarDot).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6090f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

(<a href="http://www.uclinux.org" target="_self">www.uclinux.org</a>), is
based on a 54MHz Motorola ColdFire microprocessor equipped with 8MB
of RAM memory and 2MB of nonvolatile Flash memory. I/O ports
include a pair of RS-232 serial ports, a 10Mbps Ethernet port, an
I2C serial bus and four bits of digital I/O. The device implements
a web server function based on Boa
(<a href="http://www.boa.org" target="_self">www.boa.org</a>), which allows
it to be accessed remotely from a web browser anywhere in the
world, provided it's connected to the Internet via either Ethernet,
modem or wireless. (See

Inside</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>snom 100 VoIP Phone</b></span>: The
snom VoIP phone supports a wide range of open telephony standards
including SIP, H.323/H.450 and Asterisk, along with data protocols
like HTTP, TAPI and LDAP. The company says the snom 100's IP-based
voice quality is indistinguishable from that of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; ISDN
phones and, in addition, the 128 &times; 64 pixel graphical LCD
display and web-browser interface make calling, remote management
and configuration even easier. In addition to its IP functionality,
the device also provides typical telephone features like call hold,
call waiting, call forward/transfer, call divert, caller line
identification, and so on. Inside the snom 100, there's a 50MHz
Motorola MPC855T PowerQUICC Integrated Communications processor
equipped with 16MB of RAM. The system's embedded OS, based on a
Linux 2.4.18 kernel, was developed in-house, and snom created their
own drivers and libraries for the use of the 128 &times; 64 pixel
graphical LCD and even wrote their own embedded HTTP server. (See
<a href="http://www.snomag.de/snom100_en.htm" target="_self">www.snomag.de/snom100_en.htm</a>.)</p><p>

</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>hippo Internet Phone</b></span>: The
hippo Internet Phone looks a lot like an ordinary desktop
telephone, but it can make calls over either Ethernet LAN or normal
telephone lines (via PPP, through the user's local ISP). Instead of
being carried as analog signals over normal phone lines, the calls
are carried digitally over the Internet. At the other end, the
calls can be received by either another Internet Phone (PC-based or
dedicated Internet Phones) or by a standard PSTN (Public Switched
Telephone Network) telephone anywhere in the world, including cell
phones. Obviously, substantial reductions in phone bills are
possible using this approach because no long-distance phone service
is necessary. The hippo Internet Phone has a 4 &times; 20 character
LCD screen, a 12-button telephone keypad, six function keys and a
telephone handset with hook/switch, ringer and normal-sounding dial
and call progress tones that simulate &ldquo;normal&rdquo; telephone
operation. Inside hippo's Internet Phone is an embedded computer
based on a 48MHz Motorola MPC850/823 PowerPC system-on-chip
processor that is equipped with 16MB of DRAM and also runs an
embedded Linux OS derived from MontaVista's Hard Hat Linux. (See

</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>SONICblue Rio Central</b></span>: This
high-fidelity home stereo component that stores up to 650 CDs'
worth of music on its built-in 40GB hard drive is said to be &ldquo;as
simple to use as a CD player, but as smart as a PC&rdquo;--a Linux-based
PC, that is. The system is intended to function as a standalone
audio system, making it easy to store your music (&ldquo;you load your
CDs, the device does the rest&rdquo;) and create an essentially
unlimited number of customized playlists. Thereafter, a large
display, intuitive interface and advanced search features are meant
to make it easy to find the music you want instantly. Plus, the
system optionally offers suggestions based on your tracked
listening habits. Inside, there's a 206MHz Intel StrongARM
processor along with 16MB of system RAM, running an embedded Linux
OS derived by the system's developers from Debian/ARM sources. In
addition to its standalone operation, the Rio Central can also be
used as the basis of a broader Rio experience, serving one or more
companion Rio Receiver thin clients (which also run embedded Linux)
via HomePNA (phone line networking) or Ethernet. It also can
download files to Rio portable MP3 players via USB. The device is
broadband-ready (via an external USB-to-Ethernet adapter), includes
a built-in 56Kbit/sec modem (for users without broadband access)
and provides a 10Mbps HomePNA connection. (See

</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Cyclades Device Server</b></span>: The
Cyclades TS100 is a powerful yet highly compact device server used
to connect various serial devices to a TCP/IP network. Typical
applications include industrial automation and control, out-of-band
network management, retail automation and connecting various types
of serially interfaced devices to networks. The device provides
interface ports for both 10/100Mb Ethernet and RS-232/RS-485 serial
lines, allowing it to integrate legacy instruments and systems
having serial interfaces to broadband networks using TCP/IP. Unlike
its competitors, which are typically based on proprietary software
models, the TS100's built-in embedded Linux OS and other
open-source software make it easy to customize operation of the
TS100. Although not much larger than a deck of playing cards (2.8"
&times; 3.4" &times; 1.2"), the TS100 contains not just one but two
microprocessors. This is possible thanks to the use of Motorola's
MPC855T &ldquo;PowerQUICC Integrated Communications Processor&rdquo;. The
MPC855T is a dual-core system-on-chip processor that includes a
PowerPC core processor (running at 50MHz) plus a separate RISC
engine specifically designed to off-load communication tasks.
Memory resources consist of 16MB of SDRAM, plus a 4MB Flash disk
from which the firmware is uncompressed and loaded into a RAM disk
at boot time. The device's embedded Linux OS is based on a 2.2.14
kernel, along with a variety of open-source utilities including the
GoAhead web server (for web-based setup and management of the
device), Portslave, OpenSSH 3.1, crontab, BusyBox, net-tools,
rsyncm and others. Cylades started from MontaVista's Hard Hat Linux
1.2 and added their own in-house customization. (See

</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linksys Wireless Presentation
Gateway</b></span>: Using this embedded Linux-powered device,
wireless mobile PC users can project presentations and other data
using VGA-equipped devices such as multimedia projectors, monitors
and LCD panels without having to physically wire each PC to the
projector. The WPG11 lets users take turns controlling the display
instantly. Users are each assigned unique key codes for access and
control of the device. Because cabling and setup time is
eliminated, WiFi-enabled users can take turns controlling the
presentation display simply by typing in the pre-assigned key
codes. In real time, participants can offer instant visual input
that follows the verbal discussion. Perhaps it even solves the
inevitable incompatibilities between the laptops and the
projectors? (See
