    Virtex-II Pro FPGA and MontaVista Linux provide a highly flexible and powerful solution for embedded system designers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x267e580.0x27767c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>How many times have you faced the problem
that after the specification phase is complete you simply cannot
find a matching microprocessor with the required type and number of
peripherals? How many times did you find out that for the closest
matching microprocessor no Linux port is available? How hard was it
to put together all the tools you need to design and debug your
system? How many hours have you spent working around all of these
issues? In any case, relax! The Virtex-II Pro FPGA family and the
corresponding tools combined with MontaVista Linux OS and
development environment enables you to pick your system &agrave; la
carte and saves you a lot of time and sweat.
</p><p>The Virtex-II Pro FPGA family offers up to four hard-core
PowerPC 405 processors, 16 Rocket I/O 3.125Gbps serial
transceivers, 3.8Mb of block RAM (BRAM) and four million system
gates on a single programmable platform chip. This rich set of
features opens the field for a wide range of applications and
provides high flexibility for system designers. Single-chip systems
with an arbitrary number and type of I/O devices are possible. For
example, you can have five UARTs, a PCI bus and several Gigabit
Ethernet ports all controlled by the on-chip processors.</p><p>An Xilinx partnership with IBM introduces support for the
hard-core PPC405, a robust busing standard and a device fabrication
process. Xilinx offers a wide variety of intellectual property (IP)
cores for the Virtex-II Pro FPGA, which are predefined hardware
blocks that directly snap into IBM's CoreConnect bus technology
(Figure 1).</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6073f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. IP Cores Connected to CoreConnect
</p></div></div><p>CoreConnect has several features for interconnecting the
processor to the FPGA fabric in order to construct system designs.
The key CoreConnect features are the application-oriented system
buses, which include the processor local bus (PLB), the on-chip
peripheral bus (OPB) and the device control register (DCR) bus.
Selected IP cores include many forms of I/O and external memory
controllers. For I/O, the cores include 16450- and 16550-compatible
UARTs, IIC controller and SPI controller. The memory controllers
include support for SRAM/FLASH, SDRAM, DDR SDRAM and ZBT devices.
More sophisticated, system-level I/O is also available as IP cores:
PCI cores, 10/100 Mb Ethernet, Gb Ethernet and the System ACE
configuration interface. Each core is delivered with a
corresponding driver where appropriate. The drivers are shipped as
source code.</p><p>The powerful software design tools that help the user make
use of the processors, the IP cores and, more generally the FPGA,
will be described here in more detail. The interaction of this
hardware and software is unique for the Virtex-II Pro FPGA because
it enables the design of a completely custom embedded system
solution on a single chip. The issues of hardware/software codesign
include use of powerful application software tools for embedded
Linux and some unique tools for embedded debugging. Before delving
into codesign issues, let's look a little deeper inside the
Virtex-II Pro FPGA.</p><p>The PowerPC 405 processors run at 300+ MHz and each have 16KB
of data and 16KB of instruction cache. The PLB and OPB buses run at
100+ MHz. A powerful feature of the Virtex-II Pro FPGA is the
implementation of the on-chip memory (OCM). The OCM is memory that
has similar access characteristics as the processor caches but is
managed by the user. The Virtex-II Pro FPGA implements the OCM as
dual-ported BRAM, allowing for an extremely fast data path from
peripheral devices to the processor or as a communication buffer
between processors.</p><p>The Rocket I/O 3.125Gbps serial transceivers support many
different communication standards, listed in Table 1. Important
features like buffers, 8B/10B encoding and decoding, and CRC
calculation and checking are implemented on-chip and do not take
space away from the FPGA fabric.</p><p><a href="6073t1.html" target="_self">Table 1. Virtex-II Pro Platform
FPGAs support these protocols and baud rates.</a></p><p>The BRAMs can be used as memory accessible by the processors
and can be connected to CoreConnect or as OCM. While OCM offers
better performance and a direct way to the processor, hooking up
the BRAM to the PLB makes it available for DMA transfers where the
processor is not involved. It is up to the system designer to
decide how the BRAM is used best.</p><p>The FPGA fabric can be filled with IP cores provided from
Xilinx or with user-specified designs. While some of the IP cores
interact with each other, others work completely in
parallel.</p><p>Because FPGAs can be reconfigured dynamically you can even
switch the number and type of devices while the system is running.
Such a flexible platform needs a powerful operating system and
tools for hardware and software engineers to develop and debug
their embedded applications.</p><p>Depending on their application, users may choose from a wide
variety of COTS (commercially available off the shelf) real-time
operating systems, proprietary RTOS or embedded Linux environments.
In the Linux arena, Xilinx chose MontaVista Linux as a suitable
embedded OS and development environment for the Virtex-II Pro FPGA
family because of its extreme versatility. Linux, by default,
supports a wide range of devices. Xilinx and MontaVista Software
chose to use a layered device-driver approach. It is split into a
low-level, OS-independent layer that directly sets up on the
hardware and an OS specific adaptation layer that sits in the
middle between the OS and the low-level drivers. Xilinx provides
the low-level drivers written for optimal performance and best use
of the functionality of the IP cores. MontaVista Software
implements the adaptation layer for Linux and uses its expertise
for a seamless integration of the drivers. Both driver layers are
pushed into the open-source repository and are released under the
GPL (General Public License). All device drivers can be compiled
into the kernel or are available as loadable modules. Being able to
load and unload driver modules supports hardware that can be
reconfigured while the system is running. Replacing hardware in a
running system is a well-known process for external devices like
USB devices and PC cards, but replacing hardware on the chip and
dynamically loading the corresponding Linux driver is something
completely new.</p><p>The Linux port is first targeted toward the Virtex-II Pro
ML300 Platform from Xilinx (shown in Figure 2), and it supports
most of the IP cores and hardware on this board. Since the ML300 is
an elaborate board with a lot of functionality, it will be easy for
users and customers to adapt the port to their own specific
hardware. MontaVista Software offers professional support for such
projects.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6073f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Still, hardware and software engineers need powerful tools to
develop, boot and debug their systems. With System Generator for
Processors, GDB/XMD, System ACE and ChipScope Pro, Xilinx has a
complete tool suite for all aspects of hardware, software and
systems engineering.</p><p>System Generator for Processors (SGP) helps you put together
the design for the Virtex-II Pro FPGA both on the hardware and on
the software sides. In user-friendly dialog boxes you can specify
all the parameters for the system, like base addresses for the
peripherals, interrupts to be used and amount of memory present. As
a result, SGP emits the hardware design files that are ready for
FPGA implementation or simulation and a parameter file that is used
when the Linux kernel is built and the corresponding driver modules
are created. Listing 1 shows an excerpt of the parameter file. In
this case, the user assigned parameters to configure the interrupt
controller in the system.</p><p><a href="6073l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. Excerpt of the Parameter
File to Configure the Device Drivers</a></p><p>SGP gives system architects the flexibility to investigate
different options and variations for their new embedded systems.
Setting the parameters to different values tailors the hardware and
software to the specific requirements. Only functionality that will
be accessed and used is included in the system; other functionality
is stripped out of the design. Additionally, devices are
preconfigured with the default parameters. As a result the hardware
and software use less space, offer better performance and the
initialization process is much simpler (in some cases it is not
even required). SGP and its companion tools use an open interface
that makes it simple for users to add their own hardware
functionality and software drivers. XMD is a debugging server using
the on-chip debug (OCD) protocol to communicate with GDB on the
host system. It controls the target system through the JTAG port of
a processor in the Virtex-II Pro FPGA. At the same time, XMD serves
multiple GDBs. Thus, it is possible to debug more than one
processor at once. More specifically, all four processors within
one Virtex-II Pro FPGA can be debugged simultaneously. On Linux,
GDB runs on the command line or with one of the different front
ends. It is compiled with support for the Insight GUI but can also
be used with DDD and Emacs.</p><p>In GDB the PPC405 architecture was added and the &ldquo;target
ocd&rdquo; command was extended to support all the features of the
Virtex-II Pro FPGA. As a result all the registers of the PPC405,
the caches, the TLB (translation look aside buffer) entries and the
contents of the OCM cannot only be inspected and changed but also
can be mapped into the memory space of the processor.</p><p>Debugging an embedded system traditionally has been a
difficult process. You have to look at hardware and software at the
same time. An external, non-intrusive software debugger like GDB
combined with XMD is a big help. Additionally, the PPC405 supports
hardware breakpoints and allows freezing the processor on
exceptions. But especially when processors and peripherals are
integrated on the same chip, it is difficult to see what
transactions are executed and how (in which order) memory is
accessed. All the important signals are buried within the chip, and
there is normally no way to get access to these signals. The
Virtex-II Pro FPGA does not have such a limitation because it
integrates peripherals as soft hardware. All signals are visible
and can be accessed with the appropriate tool.</p><p>ChipScope Pro is an integrated hardware logic analyzer. It
consists of a logic analyzer running on the debugging host system
and a set of trigger and data units compiled or inserted into the
hardware design. The integrated logic analyzer (ILA) units can be
hooked up to any number of signals inside the FPGA and can trigger
on user-defined conditions or processor bus transactions. Multiple
ILA units can be active at the same time. Sometimes it is useful to
hook up multiple ILAs to the same signals. In one case, we hooked
up two different ILA units to the PLB address and data lines to
resolve a problem with corrupted memory. One ILA was hooked up to
the PLB signals connected to the PPC405. We knew that the processor
would do a memory access at the time when the corruption would
occur. The other ILA was hooked up to the PLB signals connected to
the DDR memory controller. By comparing the address and data lines
reported by the two ILA units, we were able to isolate the problem
and fix it. Having access to the hardware and being able to watch
bus transactions is very useful, especially in Linux where the MMU
is used. From a software perspective, the same physical block of
RAM can be mapped into many different virtual address spaces. On
the hardware level, all addresses are physical.</p><p>The combination of ChipScope Pro, GDB and XMD gives the
developer extremely high visibility into the system. The software
tools share a common cable and communicate through the JTAG port of
the FPGA. The friendly cooperation between the tools reduces the
number of cables and makes the setup of the debugging environment
much easier.</p><p>The boot process is an imminently important phase when an
embedded system is powered up. In a few steps the components on the
board, the processor, the memory system and the communication
infrastructure are brought up. On the Virtex-II Pro FPGA, the boot
process happens in two steps. On one hand, the FPGA is configured,
and on the other hand, the processor is started. The FPGA needs to
be configured with its functionality in one of many different ways.
We will show one recommended method later in this article. Often a
specialized primary boot loader is used to start the processor,
bring up the system, load the Linux kernel into memory and transfer
control to the entry point of the kernel. The Virtex-II Pro FPGA
supports this traditional boot method where the primary boot loader
resides in external ROM or in internal BRAM. The latter case
removes the need for external ROM in that the primary boot loader
is included in the bit stream that configures the FPGA. Immediately
after the FPGA is configured the processor is released from reset,
starts reading instructions from the internal BRAM and executes the
primary boot loader.</p><p>A new and, especially with MontaVista Linux, powerful
solution to boot the system uses System ACE. System ACE is a
companion chip external to the Virtex-II Pro FPGA and allows
booting a system without having any ROM. It has two main functions.
For one, it boots the system by configuring the FPGA, the processor
and any device on the processor bus through the JTAG chain from a
CompactFlash card or a Microdrive. And two, it uses the same
storage device as a filesystem accessible by Linux.</p><p>The Microdrive contains a FAT12 or FAT16 and a Linux
partition. The Linux kernel is configured with support for the
System ACE device, compiled, converted into a System ACE-specific
file format, concatenated with the configuration bit stream for the
FPGA and stored on the FAT filesystem. On power-up, System ACE
reads the configuration file from the FAT filesystem, configures
the FPGA and boots the kernel. During the boot process, the Linux
kernel mounts the Linux partition on the Microdrive as a root
filesystem. The non-obvious advantages of booting with System ACE
are that no memory at all is required at the reset vector of the
processor, different boot configurations can be stored on the FAT
partition and the boot configuration can be changed by normal file
operations.</p><p>System ACE works on the JTAG chain like an external debugger
through the debug port of the processor. Code, data and, if
required, a RAM disk, for the Linux kernel are loaded through the
JTAG chain and the processor bus into system memory. Configuration
of any devices in the system accessible by the processor can be
done in the same way before the kernel is loaded. And at the end,
the program counter of the PPC405 is set to the start address of
the Linux kernel and directly executed from this location.</p><p>A switch points System ACE to one of eight active
configurations. The configuration to be loaded also can be set by
software. A running Linux system selects the new configuration,
resets the system and boots into this new configuration that may
consist of a different set of peripherals.</p><p>The FAT filesystem allows Linux to update the System ACE file
while the system is running&mdash;a very powerful solution to upgrade
hardware and software in-system and on the fly.</p><p>The Virtex-II Pro Developer's Kit adds another dimension to a
successful system design experience. The kit allows you to simulate
your embedded system before you build real hardware and introduces
another abstraction level during the debugging phase. Each
component of the system can be simulated on its own. Once the whole
system is put together, hardware and software can be run in the
simulation to verify the functionality of the embedded system.
Problems observed in real hardware can be taken back into
simulation and tracked down. GDB/XMD can be configured to connect
to HDL simulators and enables an engineer to follow the program
execution step by step and watch the bus transactions and hardware
state changes as they occur. The completeness of the combination of
the Virtex-II Pro FPGA with MontaVista Linux makes it an ideal
platform for many different applications. The Rocket I/O serial
multigigabit transceivers make it interesting for
telecommunications, for example, in base stations where complex
calculations have to be combined with high bandwidth and enormous
computing power. The same transceivers can also be used as a
backplane interconnect between multiple devices. The available
peripherals combined with up to four processors also make it an
ideal platform for data and graphics terminals or even as a
workstation.</p><p>The integration of processors into the FPGA fabric offers
some opportunities for interesting system architectures and future
development. On the architectural side, in a simple system,
multiple processors can be interconnected by a shared PLB. A more
complex system uses a switched approach to prevent congestion on
the bus and gain better performance. Due to the nature of FPGAs,
system designers might start with the simple approach and later
change their strategy. In any case, Linux will have to support the
architecture. Since semaphores and mutexes are easily implemented
by dual-ported BRAM, resource management and access to shared
memory are straightforward. Hardware/software coprocessing will
improve system performance a great deal. While hardware is fast and
can execute in parallel, software is much more flexible. Linux will
call certain system functions that in reality are implemented in
hardware. It will be a challenge for the system designer to find
the functions for which it makes sense to off-load into hardware,
but it pays off in a faster and more dynamic system. In an even
more complicated system Linux will use dynamic coprocessing. It
partially reconfigures the FPGA with the desired hardware functions
optimized for the currently running applications. While one
application calculates extensive FFT transformations, another
application searches for patterns in a data stream. Whenever the
scheduler transfers control to one of the two applications, it also
replaces the corresponding IP. Based on statistical data, the
scheduler decides whether the application will be hardware
accelerated or whether a corresponding software function is used.
The Virtex-II Pro FPGA and MontaVista Linux combined with the
corresponding system generation, debugging and configuration tools
is a powerful and flexible solution. It enables you to implement
the design in your specification and not the one given by hardware
and software limitations, increases the integration factor without
losing observabilitiy, reduces time-to-market because of available
IP cores and related software drivers, and finally, opens a new
dimension to your creativity with respect to hardware/software
codesign.</p></div></div>
