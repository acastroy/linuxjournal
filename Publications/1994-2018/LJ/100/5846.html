at Christmas washes over me&mdash;a new toy to play with. Only this is
no ordinary toy. This is a DS3 (T3) router that costs under $4,200
US. Three years ago I would have scoffed at the possibility of such
a thing. I was used to the world of Nortel and Cisco, a world in
which a router this powerful cost as much as a new car and, in some
cases, a small house. It was a world in which RAM and card upgrades
became necessary due to the growing number of routes on the
Internet, and the aforementioned companies would charge in excess
of $15,000 US for an upgrade that really didn't allow your router
to do anything it wasn't doing the year before. And it was aworld
in which good technical support meant signing a $10,000/year
contract. Boy, the world has changed since then.
</p><p>Anyhow, back to the box. Opening it, I find the new and
improved Rebel Router from ImageStream. For those of you who don't
know, ImageStream makes Linux-based routers that are capable of
wire-speed throughput yet are incredibly flexible and inexpensive.
I have been using theses routers for the past two years, both in my
network and in customer networks, with great success. The new Rebel
Router comes in a black rackmount case about the size of a Cisco
2500 (height: 1U, depth: 10.75"). The front is adorned with the
ImageStream logo and a blue LED that really makes it stand out on a
network rack. The back panel includes dual 10/100 Ethernet ports,
an auxiliary console port, a couple of fans for cooling and two PCI
card slots. In order for me to test this router for <i  >Linux Journal</i>, I requested a configuration that I could use to
replace my current network router. Because of those needs, my
configuration includes a single DS3 card and a Quad T1 card.</p><p>Upon opening the case, I was struck by the neat layout. The
case is segmented into three parts. The left side of the case
contains the single power supply. The central section contains what
is essentially a PC-based motherboard sans PS/2 and parallel ports.
The right side contains the area for the serial cards. ImageStream
sells cards for this router in the following capacities: single or
quad 10/100 Ethernet; single, double, quad or octal port T1; and
single DS3. ImageStream does sell Dual DS3 cards, but they don't
recommend them for this router. Instead they recommend a platform
with multiple CPUs for a multiple DS3 configuration. On a further
note, under the recommended configurations they guarantee wire
speed.</p><p>Now to the real point of this review: what can the Rebel
Router do? One great feature of this router is its ability to bond
multiple interfaces. For instance, you can bond two T1s to get a
3Mb channel as opposed to a fractional DS3. This can come in handy
if you want to avoid the high local loop charges associated with
most DS3s. As the marketing literature says, you can provide
connectivity for up to 16 T1/E1s or one DS3/E3, but aside from the
level of throughput, the most impressive part of this router is the
routing capabilities. The Rebel Router uses GateD, originally
developed by Merrit. These are the same people that developed the
Radius standard, as well as many other technological advances used
on the Internet today. GateD supports static, RIP, OSPF and, most
importantly (for ISPs and large companies), BGP-4 routing.</p><p>For those unaware, BGP-4 is the standard used to route
traffic across the Internet dynamically, and it is used in almost
all configurations that are truly redundant (i.e., connections to
more than one upstream provider). As the Internet has exploded in
growth over the past few years, so have the number of routes in the
routing tables. This has caused many ISPs to have to upgrade their
RAM, which can be prohibitively expensive, as I mentioned above.
ImageStream uses a relatively off-the-shelf, unbuffered RAM that is
inexpensive when compared to the proprietary RAM sold by other
router manufacturers. Combine this with the fact that these routers
are slightly modified PCs using Intel processors, that you have
your choice of the 2.2.14 or 2.4 Linux kernel, and you get an
incredibly powerful router without the hefty price tag of something
that is totally proprietary.</p><p>Some of the other wonderful features of this router are the
result of its Linux-based nature. For example, If you are like me
and wouldn't use Telnet on your servers to save your soul, then
guess what? You don't have to on your routers either. All
ImageStream routers allow you to turn off Telnet in favor of SSH.
If you don't feel like learning a new firewall language or messing
around with access lists, then you can use the ipchains that come
with the current 3.2 distribution. The 2.4 kernel, and therefore
iptables, are also available. In addition, if you truly hate to use
menus to get things done, you can always drop to the shell and do
anything that you would do in a normal Linux system. Because all of
the files for configuring your interfaces, routing, firewalling,
etc., are in ASCII format, you can open them in vi or Pico and make
your changes.</p><p>Other great features of the Rebel include the ability to see
the traffic flowing through the router in real time. ImageStream
routers come with a program called Stats that works just like the
top command (also available from the command line), except that
instead of seeing system resources you can see your interface-usage
statistics. This feature helps a great deal when you're
troubleshooting. Another great feature is the QOS system that uses
Diffserv to allow you to limit bandwidth and shape parts of your
network down to the single-IP level. This can become essential in a
limited bandwidth environment if you need to give priority to
certain types of traffic.</p><p>One of the new services that this router provides is IPSec
using FreeS/WAN. This is something I had never played with prior to
this router test, so I ended up getting on the phone with the
support staff at ImageStream because I did not want to chance doing
something wrong and taking my network down. I spoke with Josh, who
was very knowledgeable and friendly and helped me set up a test
VPN. We first set up a subnet-to-subnet VPN. This setup took about
15 minutes, as I was a newbie and wanted to understand everything
about it. Once that was done we were able to set up additional VPN
tunnel variations rapidly, including subnet-to-PC and
PC-to-PC.</p><p>Over the span of the week that I tested the router, it
performed flawlessly. Because I have used ImageStream routers
before, I felt totally confident that it would perform without a
hitch as the core of my network, and it didn't let me down. During
that time period I added an additional T1 to the network, changed
the BGP-4 AS number and added another block of addresses in the
normal course of business. In addition, I tested the IPSec service
and did DS3 throughput tests, all without a hitch.</p><p>Finally, the most important feature of these routers is the
support. I have used ImageStream routers for almost two years now
and have found that the biggest savings in the purchase of these
routers is the support. ImageStream's support personnel are
knowledgeable, friendly and go out of their way to ensure that you
are happy with the product. The best part about dealing with
ImageStream is that there are no support contracts. They provide
24/7 tech support and free software updates for the life of the
product, and they warranty the hardware for a year. That being
said, there is nothing on the market today that can touch the Rebel
Router from a cost/savings perspective.</p><p><a href="5846s1.html" target="_self">Information/The Good/The
