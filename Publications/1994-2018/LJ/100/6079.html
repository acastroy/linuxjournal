about a month ago. It went something like this (abbreviated for
space): &ldquo;Hey David, I have problem with a client's mail server
[Caldera eServer 2.3]. It's been running great since I installed it
two years ago, but a power failure caused it to shut down. Now, the
system comes up, but the Ethernet interfaces won't come up.&rdquo; Me:
&ldquo;Well, let's bring them up manually and see why they don't come up
at bootup. Any problems with fsck?&rdquo; Friend: &ldquo;None. I've tried
running ifconfig, but it won't configure the interfaces.&rdquo; Me:
&ldquo;Run <b  >lsmod</b>, if the drivers aren't installed.
Let's do that first, then humor me and run
<b  >ifconfig</b> exactly as I give it to you.&rdquo; Friend:
&ldquo;Modules are installed; ifconfig segfaults.&rdquo; Me: &ldquo;Segfaults?
(With alarm bells going off in my head.) Let's replace the ifconfig
RPM in case it was damaged when the system crashed (as I'm
thinking, ifconfig is one of the least likely apps to go south).
You'll have to use <b  >--force</b> to replace the
ifconfig package.&rdquo; Friend: &ldquo;It appears ifconfig can't be
replaced, even with --force.&rdquo; Me: &ldquo;Please run <b  >lsattr
ifconfig</b> and tell me what you see.&rdquo; Friend: &ldquo;I see an
'i' to the left of the name.&rdquo; Me (with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star
Trek</em></span>'s &ldquo;whoop, Intruder Alert&rdquo; playing in my mind):
&ldquo;Humor me again. Run <b  >locate ifconfig</b>.&rdquo; Friend:
&ldquo;/sbin/ifconfig; /dev/sdg/.azgub/backup/ifconfig,
/usr/man/man8/ifconfig.8.gz.&rdquo; Me: &ldquo;Well, you just found a rootkit
hidden in /dev. Your client has been broken into. By the way, have
any of the security patches been applied to that server since
installation?&rdquo; (No answer, but I assume not.)
</p><p>It's a month since I sent a quote to fix his security
problems and install a firewall (among other services). The
intruder is still in this system, the Ethernet cards are in
promiscuous mode, and the client seems oblivious to the dangers
(says he's changed his passwords, so he's taken
precautions&mdash;right). Who's inside? Why? Has this system with a
fairly large pipe been used to break into other systems and/or act
as a zombie to perform DDOS attacks? Some folks should not be
allowed to remain connected to the Internet. Is he alone? Not
hardly. My servers are pounded daily, my bandwidth being eaten by
virii, automated attacks, etc. And, I'm paying for unnecessary
bandwidth because of it. There should be a law.</p><p>SmtpRC
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/smtprc" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/smtprc</a></p><p>Need to find out if you (or someone on your network) are
contributing to the spam problem? This tool is all you need to help
stop the spam problems on your network. Requires: libpthread,
glibc.</p><p>GTK-Agenda
<a href="http://brufal.kleenux.org/proyectos.shtml" target="_self">brufal.kleenux.org/proyectos.shtml</a></p><p>This is an excellent start on a nice GTK agenda. It holds
names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses in a PostgreSQL database.
Currently available only in Spanish, changing the labels, etc., to
English, German, whatever, should be fairly simple&mdash;although
Internationalization would be the way to go. You can send e-mails
from within this application, but you'll need an SMTP d&aelig;mon
running. Should be an easily extended application for your database
needs. Requires: libgtk, libgdk, libgmodule, libglib, libdl,
libXext, libX11, libm, libpq, libssl, libcrypto, libcrypt,
libresolv, libnsl, glibc.</p><p>x86info
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/x86info" target="_self">sourceforge.net/projects/x86info</a></p><p>If you need to find out more than you can get from
/proc/cpuinfo, this may be what you need. It reads directly from
the CPU registers, so it can provide more information than what
most of us will need or even understand. Requires: glibc.</p><p>ILIAS
<a href="http://www.ilias.uni-koeln.de/ios/index-e.html" target="_self">www.ilias.uni-koeln.de/ios/index-e.html</a></p><p>If you're looking for a way to give courses and tests over
the Internet, ILIAS is another tool that will allow you to do this.
Data on students, test scores, etc., are all maintained in a MySQL
database. Requires: Apache w/PHP and MySQL, MySQL server, GD, zlib,
freetype, libjpeg, ImageMagick, zip, unzip.</p><p>pktstat
<a href="http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/~leonard/personal/software/#pktstat" target="_self">www.itee.uq.edu.au/~leonard/personal/software/#pktstat</a></p><p>There are a lot of utilities out there for watching packets
on your network, but this one is slightly different. It looks at
the percentage of bandwidth use for packets. This little jewel can
tell you very quickly that one of your abusers running Kazaa is
gobbling 99.7% of the available bandwidth. Requires: libm,
glibc.</p><p>DNSMan
<a href="http://www.xsta.cc/dnsman" target="_self">www.xsta.cc/dnsman</a></p><p>This web application is probably one of the easiest ways to
maintain your BIND zone files, even easier than Webmin's BIND
module. Requirements are small, but it does mean running a web
server on your DNS platform. I'll be watching this one as it
develops, as the author has a number of interesting items on his
to-do list. Requires: web server (Apache) capable of running CGI
scripts, Perl, BIND 8 or 9.</p><p>ntop
<a href="http://www.ntop.org" target="_self">www.ntop.org</a></p><p>This month's pick from three years ago wavered between two
great programs: ntop and stickerbook, a great program for children
(mine love it, but ntop won). This is now a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>much</em></span> improved version of ntop. It has
developed from a simple ncurses utility to an advanced web client
using HTTPS or HTTP for connections, with graphing in gdgraph
(optional). <span   class="bold"><b>ntop</b></span> now bears little
resemblance to its former self and is easier to use and read. If
you need a top-like utility for your network, you need this.
Requires: libmysqlclient, libcrypt, libm, libssl, libpthread,
libresolv, libnsl, libdl, libgdbm, libz, glibc. Until next
month.</p></div></div>
