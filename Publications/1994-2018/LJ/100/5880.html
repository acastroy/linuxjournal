multiplatform network at your fingertips&mdash;one that fits right on
your desk? That may not be the first item on everyone's wish list,
but as a company that creates solutions for integrating different
operating systems, it certainly ranked high on ours.
</p><p>The biggest limiting factor to accomplishing this was
obviously space, but with the help of OmniCluster Technologies, our
dream became a reality. We first met OmniCluster at LinuxWorld 2001
in San Francisco, where they were demonstrating what looked like
some type of network expansion board, but turned out to be a
complete Linux blade server on a PCI card.</p><p>The SlotServer is a half-length industry standard PCI card
that contains a fully compatible x86-based server blade with two
network adapters. The standard bracket provides an integrated
100Mbps network interface. A second &ldquo;Modular Network&rdquo; is also
provided as a peer network connection between the host system and
each card. This network adapter is essentially two Gigabit Ethernet
adapters set back to back in the same integrated circuit. One of
these adapters is connected to the PCI bus of the SlotServer
processor and the other connects to the PCI bottom-edge connector
and hence to the &ldquo;host&rdquo; system. Multiple peer modular networks
can then form a high-speed local private network with the host
machine. This high-speed connection allows each SlotServer to
operate diskless Windows or Linux from a &ldquo;virtual partition&rdquo; of
the host machine's filesystem. This permits a RAID filesystem to be
shared by many SlotServers and enables a provided utility, called
Virtual Disk Manager, to create, replicate, remove and associate
operating system images for all the SlotServers in a system. The
SlotServer kit even includes one sample OS image.</p><p>The SlotServer can be loaded with Windows 2000, NT, XP, Linux
and FreeBSD operating system environments and can run any
application supported by those operating systems. It fits into any
standard PCI slot, allowing you to have complex server clusters and
multiple operating systems within a single PC base. The minimum of
two network ports per SlotServer permits processing information
in-line to or from the host.</p><p>We had previously looked at other blade servers from various
vendors, but they were considerably more expensive and required an
additional proprietary chassis, bumping the cost up even more. So,
we decided to give the SlotServer a try.</p><p>We obtained our first SlotServer for use in our support
organization. Our products run on Windows and provide file-sharing
capabilities with any operating system that uses NFS (network
filesystem), including UNIX or Linux, so we get support calls
involving a wide range of operating systems. With the different
variations of UNIX and Linux available, we would require a large
number of servers in-house if we did support using traditional
methods. The ability to use SlotServers to run these operating
systems has allowed us to support them by using only a couple of
mini-tower-based host systems. We have saved countless hours in
building and rebuilding systems to different operating systems or
specific versions of an operating system, enabling us to test and
resolve issues more quickly for our customers.</p><p>The SlotServer provides the same benefits of multiple servers
and operating systems within one system for our developers. Our
products run on and are developed on the Windows operating system.
However, since the products are used to share files between Windows
and other operating systems, a minimum of two machines are needed
for even a cursory test. Using the installed SlotServer, the
developers have a complete test environment consisting of two
different operating systems within a single machine. This allows
them to perform functionality tests efficiently without needing
external resources. It's also very helpful when testing
precertified, unstable code. If a blue screen occurs on the
SlotServer, their host machine will not be affected.</p><p>The SlotServer has also proven to be very beneficial for us
at tradeshows. They're lightweight and easy to ship&mdash;we used to
spend a small fortune just shipping the number of various machines
we needed to demonstrate our products. With the ability to
configure different operating systems on each SlotServer within one
mini-tower system, we are able to demonstrate all of our products
at a tradeshow using one mini-tower and two laptops.</p><p>We can also easily change our server configuration, for
example, from Red Hat to SuSE or any of the many other operating
systems supported on the SlotServer. If we are demonstrating our
DiskAccess NFS client or X-Win32 X server with Red Hat NFS server
loaded on the SlotServer, and someone wants to see our products
working with a SuSE NFS server, we can quickly comply with their
request. The SlotServer allows you to boot up in different
operating system images by way of OmniCluster's host-resident
Virtual Disk Manager (VDM). We simply assign the SuSE boot image to
the SlotServer and reboot it via VDM without affecting the host
system or any of the other SlotServers installed within the host
system. One operating system and its associated applications can be
exchanged in a minute or so. With this ease of configuration, we
can demonstrate our products within another company's server by
simply installing the SlotServer in an available PCI slot and
powering up their system.</p><p>While our use of the SlotServers has advantages from which
others could benefit, the different applications that can share a
mutual benefit with these devices is tremendous. Some of the more
mainstream uses for the SlotServers include front-end servers for
highly available web clusters, generic application mirroring for
automatic failover and even a dedicated firewall solution (Check
Point) that runs inside mission-critical servers. The use of
industry-standard PCI as the SlotServers host interface means that
blade systems made with SlotServer are not proprietary. We can use
any available PCI system as the host and any of thousands of PCI
peripheral cards can be mixed in our configurations as
necessary.</p><p>Note: this review is specific to the SlotServer 1000.
OmniCluster's SlotServer 3000 has additional features and memory.
