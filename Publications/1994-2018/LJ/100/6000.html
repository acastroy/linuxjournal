    100 of the most significant events in Linux history.

we present 100 of the most significant events in Linux history. As
shown in the timeline, the first issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i> coincided with the release of Linux 1.0. Ever
since, the fortunes of our magazine have followed those of Linux at
large.
</p><p>It's been a wild eight years, filled with a variety of
exciting events. Choosing only 100 was a difficult task, and
certainly some readers will be quick to point out events they would
have chosen that we did not, but the following manages to maintain
the roller-coaster ride that is Linux history.</p><p>We would like to recognize our indebtedness to Rebecca Sobol
and Jonathan Corbet at Linux Weekly News, for allowing us to borrow
heavily from the timeline featured on their site and for their
accurate and gracious historical editing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13b6450"></a>August 1991</h2></div></div><p>&ldquo;Hello everybody out there using minix - I'm doing a (free)
operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like
gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and
is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people
like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same
physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among
other things).I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and
things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical
within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people
would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll
implement them :-) Linus (PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code,
and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT protable (uses 386 task
switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other
than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13b6558"></a>September 1991</h2></div></div><p>Linux version 0.01 is released and put on the Net.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13b6660"></a>April 1992</h2></div></div><p>The first Linux newsgroup, comp.os.linux, is proposed and

immediately sent to Linus. &ldquo;Digital [DEC] and the Linux community
formed the first truly successful venture of suits and Linux geeks
working together&rdquo;, said maddog.</p><p>Linux International, a nonprofit vendor organization, is
founded by Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall. Linux International goes on to

prominent Linux companies demanding money for use of the trademark
&ldquo;Linux&rdquo;. A lawsuit is filed in 1996 against Della Croce.
Plai.pngfs in the suit include Linus Torvalds; Specialized Systems
Consultants, Inc. (publishers of <i  >Linux Journal</i>); Yggdrasil Computing, Inc.; Linux

series, launches, thanks to the folks at North Carolina State
University and in particular, Donnie Barnes. Speakers include Marc
Ewing, Rik Faith and Michael K. Johnson, among others. Linux Expo
snowballs and becomes the most popular and well-attended annual
Linux show for the next several years (after three years Red Hat
takes over organization and becomes the major sponsor). The price
for entry into the exhibit hall and a pass to the conferences?
$4.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13b73c8"></a>January 1997</h2></div></div><p>First &ldquo;Linux virus&rdquo; discovered. Called Bliss, it actually
works on any UNIX-like OS and offers a
helpful&mdash;&ldquo;bliss-uninfect-files-please&rdquo; command-line option. Alan
Cox points out that Bliss &ldquo;does not circumvent the security of the

and reminds users to install digitally signed software from
trustworthy sites only and to check signatures before
installing.</p><p>&ldquo;In fact it's probably easier to write a virus for Linux
because it's open source and the code is available. So we will be

<span   class="emphasis"><em>LWN</em></span> was to become.</p><p>Netscape announces that they will release the source to their
browser under a free software license. This almost certainly
remains one of the most important events of the year; it opened a

since become one of the higher-profile places where people are paid
to develop free software and an important component of the GNOME

other than David Miller, the source of much that is good in the
Linux kernel.</p><p>The Linux user community wins
<span   class="emphasis"><em>InfoWorld</em></span>'s technical support award; Red Hat
5.0 also won their Operating System award. But it was the tech
support award that truly opened some eyes; everybody had been
saying that Linux had no support. This was the beginning of the end
of the &ldquo;no support&rdquo; argument.</p><p>Eric Raymond and friends come up with the term &ldquo;open
source&rdquo;. They apply for trademark status and put up the
<a href="http://opensource.org" target="_self">opensource.org</a> web site.
Thus begins the formal effort to push Linux for corporate
use.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12be580.0x13b79f8"></a>March 1998</h2></div></div><p>Consumer advocate Ralph Nader asks the large PC vendors

at each other. Linus gets in on the act, saying that KDE is okay
with him. In this context, KDE 1.0 is released. The first stable
release of the K Desktop Environment proves to be popular, despite
the complaints from those who do not like the licensing of the Qt
library.</p><p>Informix quietly releases software for Linux. Meanwhile,
Oracle beats Informix to the punch PR-wise and makes a
Linux-friendly announcement first, suggesting that they would soon
be supporting Linux. Oracle promises to make a trial version
available by the end of 1998, a deadline they beat by months. This,
seemingly, was one of the acid tests for the potential of long-term
success for Linux; a great deal of attention resulted from both
Informix's and Oracle's announcements.</p><p>Informix announces support for Linux effectively moments
after Oracle does so. Sybase later announces their support for

about free software and suggests that some of the Windows NT source
code may be made available to developers. The same month Microsoft
goes on to list Linux as a competitive threat in its annual SEC (US
Securities and Exchange Commission) filing. Speculation abounds
that their real purpose is to influence the upcoming antitrust

Washington, seems almost grateful for the rising profile of Linux,
