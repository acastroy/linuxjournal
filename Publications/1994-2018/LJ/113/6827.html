My wife and I bought our house in the summer of 1996. In early
spring of 1997, the basement filled with water. In early spring
of 1998, the basement filled with water. In early spring of
2001, the basement filled with water. Fed up with the
basement filling with water, we decided it was time to install a sump
pump.
</p><p>
Late in 2003, looking up the hill at more than four feet of snow
waiting to flood our basement, we realized we never got
around to installing the sump pump we decided to get in 2001. This time
we vowed we really were going to do something, and we did. After
a week of jackhammering the basement, we had ourselves a shiny new
sump pump complete with a perimeter drain, battery backup and
snazzy cover. Not trusting the ability of this little pump to eject
all that melting snow, I become obsessed with the sump. I
checked the water level every ten minutes. I woke up at night to
check the water level. I called home from work to get a report&mdash;it was
getting absurd. The very thing that was supposed to
make me sleep easier was suddenly consuming me.
Then it dawned on me: why not rig up a contraption that would
let me monitor the pump remotely? I established some goals for the
project: 1) do not in any way burn the house down, 2) do not in any way
cause the pump to stop working, and 3) learn something.
</p><p>
In accordance with my primary and secondary goals, I decided I
would not place any new circuitry in series with the pump's power. In
addition to the obvious dangers of running 10 amps through a circuit I
constructed, a fair amount of isolation circuitry would be
required to ensure I didn't fry the processor to which I was going to
connect. One option was to wrap a coil of wire around the current-carrying conductor in the pump's cord. Presumably, after suitable
signal conditioning, the induced voltage would be detectable at the
processor. Unfortunately, given that my home electronics lab is
pretty meager, this
method likely would take too long to develop.
</p><p>
After rejecting several
other ideas, I went to Google. Eventually, I was reminded of a
phenomenon known as the Hall Effect. The Hall Effect is a
manifestation of the Lorentz force acting on electrons flowing in the
presence of a magnetic field. The Lorentz force acts normal to both
the electric and magnetic fields, causing the electrons to have a
non-uniform distribution in the direction of the Lorentz force. The
voltage induced on the surface of the conductor in this direction is
proportional to the magnetic field strength and therefore can be used
to detect its strength. A wide variety of
Hall Effect sensors are available commercially, differing in the amount of signal
conditioning they provide internally and the magnetic field strengths to
which they are sensitive. For this application, I chose the Allegro
Microsystems A3240LUA, a fairly sensitive unipolar sensor; a
datasheet is available at <a href="http://www.allegromicro.com/sf/3240" target="_self">www.allegromicro.com/sf/3240</a>. A
unipolar sensor basically acts as an NPN transistor whose base current
is on when the device is in the presence of a south magnetic pole.
</p><p>
I acquired a few of the sensors with which to experiment. My hope was
the remote sensor would consist of nothing more than the Hall effect
device connected to a general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pin on the
processor. To ease the software debugging, I decided to construct a
standalone circuit that would indicate whether the pump was on by way of an LED. This would boost my confidence that the sensor was capable
of detecting the current. I constructed the circuit shown in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6827f1.large.jpg"><img src="6827f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
I plugged the batteries in,
waved a magnet in front of the sensor and, as expected, the LED came
on. The next step was to wait for the pump to come on and wave the
sensor near the power cord to see if it could detect the near field.
Wait, wave, nothing; wait, wave, nothing. It appeared that the
near-field/far-field boundary was much closer to the conductors than I had
originally thought. The magnetic fields of the hot and neutral leads
in the power cord were close enough to cancel one another, so I
couldn't detect them. No matter where I placed the sensor, I
couldn't detect the current. Not to be dissuaded, I came up
with a slight modification to the plan. Armed with an old 15-amp
extension cord and a piece of soft iron core, I set about
strengthening the field by wrapping about ten turns of the neutral lead
around the iron core. A couple of wire ties and a bit of epoxy
completed the job. With my modified cord, I headed down to the sump.
After plugging the pump into the extension cord, I waited for some
activity. When the pump came on this time, I was able to get the test
sensor close enough to the iron core to detect the field. With a bit of
perf board, some solder and a bit more epoxy, the final sensor was
completed. Figure 2 shows the
finished sensor.

The next decision to make was what sort of a processor to use. The main
considerations were price, presence of onboard Ethernet,
available GPIOs and the ability to run Linux. After searching
for a while, I came to the conclusion that a number of
embedded microcontrollers were available that had Ethernet and enough
horsepower for this task, but most didn't explicitly mention Linux.
At the other end of the spectrum were the PC/104 class embedded PCs,
which significantly offered more muscle and cost than was needed for this
project. I ended up with a Net4501 from Soekris Engineering,
a single-board computer with a CompactFlash socket, 64MB of
RAM, an AMD Elan processor and three onboard Ethernet controllers. As
an extra bonus, the board has the ability to boot over the network through
the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE).
</p><p>
The documentation on the Soekris Web site
(<a href="http://www.soekris.com" target="_self">www.soekris.com</a>) made it clear that several of the Elan's
GPIO pins were available on a readily accessible header, along with a
+5V supply. The price was quite reasonable and included a power
supply and a nifty metal case to hold the board. Each of Elan's
GPIO pins has an internal pull-up or pull-down. Selecting one with an
internal pull-up allowed me to connect the bare sensor to the CPU
without any other components.
</p><p>
Next, I built a recent (2.4.19) kernel capable of being network-booted and
disabled almost everything. I built the kernel with no modules
and enabled the Natsemi Ethernet driver, root NFS, serial console and
the SC520 watchdog timer. In addition to the normal configuration
process, an additional change to the kernel was required for
this project. In the 2.4 series of kernels, the default timer
interrupt for x86 is set to 100Hz. Because I knew I'd be sampling a
signal running at nearly the same frequency (60Hz), I decided
to increase the timer frequency. The interrupt timer frequency is
controlled by the Hz define in asm/param.h. The upper boundary
on this value is 2K, so I set mine to 1,500 to provide
me with 1,500 timer interrupts per second. With little else running on
the machine, there would be no real likelihood of timer-based routines
interfering with one another due to the increased frequency.
</p><p>
I configured my DHCP server
and PXELINUX to serve up the previously built kernel. All that
was left was to populate the root filesystem for the TFTP sever. To
create the initial runtime environment, I built the latest uClibc,
BusyBox, TinyLogin and utelnetd packages. I statically linked all
three executables against uClibc. BusyBox's version of init
starts up a shell on the console port by default. To add other features,
I added my own /etc/inittab. It enables the console shell
and invokes a simple init script that initially (re)mounts the
root filesystem, enables the watchdog and
starts a telnetd so I can connect remotely. With a terminal connected
to the serial console port, I rebooted the device. Through the console
port I was able to see the system load and eventually drop into the
BusyBox version of the shell.
</p><p>
Once the system was up and running, it was time to focus on the new
drivers. The only kernel-space device driver needed for this project
is something to monitor the GPIO pin to which the sensor is connected.
Because I am new to kernel programming, I decided to minimize the
likelihood of anything going wrong in the kernel by limiting this
driver to the smallest possible amount of code. To that end, I
decided to write a /proc filesystem driver that simply would report
the state of the pump as on or off. Any other work that needed to
use user-space programs would poll the low-level driver.
</p><p>
The driver's init function performs three
main tasks. First, it registers itself as a /proc filesystem module
with the create_proc_entry call. The two important structures the
proc_dir_entry returned are the file and inode operations tables, which
are set to two static structures with entries filled out
appropriately. Because this is such a simple module, the vast
majority of the entries in both structures are NULL. Once the proc
entry has been created, the init routine pokes a few Elan-specific
registers to make sure the desired GPIO is set as an input.
</p><p>
The last thing the initialization routine does is kick off a timer to
check the pin at regular intervals. The timer function bears a bit more
exploration:



<pre     class="programlisting">

static void sample( unsigned long data ){

  static int remaining_samples = 0;
  __u16 dat;
  int ntimeout = 1;
  int mtimeout = Hz*mper - nsamp*ntimeout;

  if ( remaining_samples ){
    /*
     * Take another microsample
     */
    timer.expires = jiffies + ntimeout;
    remaining_samples--;
    dat = readw( pio_dat ) &amp; DMASK;
    if ( dat == 0 ){
      /* low true logic at the pin */
      sample_buf[remaining_samples] = 1;
    }
    add_timer( &amp;timer );
  }
  else {
    /*
     * We have accumulated a full buffer worth of
     * samples.  Decide if the pump is on.
     */
    int i;
    char buf[MAXSAMPLES];

    pump_state = 0;

    for( i = 0; i &lt; nsamp; i++ ){
      /* itegrate the pin signal */
      pump_state += sample_buf[i];

      /* convert to a printable buffer for
         osciloscope mode */
      buf[i] = sample_buf[i] + '0';

      /* clear the buffer for next time */
      sample_buf[i] = 0;
    }
    buf[i] = '\0';

    if((verbose==1 &amp;&amp; pump_state) || (verbose&gt;1) ){
      /* print the signal trace */
      printk( KERN_INFO
              "Sample buffer at tick (%ld) %s\n",
              jiffies, buf );
    }

    /* long tick between samples */
    remaining_samples = nsamp;
    timer.expires = jiffies + mtimeout;
    add_timer(&amp;timer);
  }

}

</pre>
</p><p>
Because the magnetic field, and therefore the
output of the sensor, oscillates, I couldn't
simply sample the state of the pin and report it
as the state of the pump. To avoid introducing any
noise in the statistics as a result of inopportune
sampling, I implemented a crude integrator. When
the timer initially fires, the remaining sample
count is reset to the number of per-period
samples desired. In the default case, we set
this value to Hz/60 or 25 samples per period.
Remember that Hz is the frequency of the kernel
timer interrupt, which I increased to 1,500 when
I built the kernel.
</p><p>
At the end of the 25 fast
samples, I reset the timer to expire again at the
end of the macro-sampling interval. In the default
case, I take a macro sample once every five seconds.
While resetting the timer, I also integrate (add)
the number of active fast samples. Because I am
sampling fairly quickly,
I can be certain to detect that
the pump is on. When I do detect that the pump
is on, I set the pump_state variable. When the
module is read (in the pump_output function),
I simply examine the state of this variable and
report it. This mechanism allows me to twiddle
around with the sample timing without affecting
the response time of the driver.
</p><p>
While debugging the driver, I added a verbose parameter to print
various tidbits to the log file. Running the module with
verbose=1 passed as a parameter causes it to dump the sample
buffer whenever it thinks the pump is on. This provides a simple
oscilloscope function, allowing me to check the log file periodically
to confirm I am not receiving any spurious results. It also
provides a second, somewhat interesting ability. Knowing the trip
points of my sensor and the phase angle (time) between the two points,
I can calculate the peak magnetic field strength at the sensor. At
1,500Hz, the sensor is on for five samples. Given that the field
oscillates at 60Hz, this gives me a phase angle of 0.4PI radians
between samples. The equations below can be solved for my sensors'
worst-case trip points (on at 50 Gauss, off at 5) for a peak amplitude
of 51.4 Gauss. Using the typical values (35 and 25) indicated that
the field is likely around 38G peak:
</p><p>
A * sin( theta ) = 35
</p><p>
 A * sin( theta + 0.4PI ) = 25
</p><p>
Another debugging aid I wrote is a similar driver that activates
an onboard LED, also connected to a GPIO, when instructed to do so. This
driver is similar to the pump driver, except the output function
(the read <span   class="emphasis"><em>from</em></span> the module) doesn't require any sophisticated
sampling, and the driver now has an input (a write <span   class="emphasis"><em>to</em></span> the module)
that allows a user to set the state of the GPIO pin. The new
function (led_input) reads a buffer from user land and decides whether
it needs to set, clear or toggle the current state of the pin. This
new function is registered using the file_operations struct. The only
other structural difference between this driver and the pump driver is
that file permissions (specified in the create_proc_entry
call) must allow write access.
This
driver coupled with a simple shell script provides feedback at the
pump that the software is working&mdash;if the LED state tracks the pump
state, everything is up and running.
</p><p>
With the basic drivers in place, it was time to build a
useful system out of all the parts. The first piece of user-space
code needed was a d&aelig;mon to enable remote queries to determine
the pump state. As my root filesystem is
mounted with NFS from my main server, I could run a simple shell
script that would sleep for a while, check /proc/pump and update
a real file with the results. But, instead of taking the
easy way out, I wrote pumpserv.
</p><p>
pumpserv is a simple d&aelig;mon that accepts a connection on port 5678 and
copies the entire contents of /proc/pump to the caller. At the other
end of the pipe is pumpwatch. pumpwatch is another
d&aelig;mon that runs on the host computer and checks the pump periodically
to record the time of each state change. The transitions
are timestamped and dumped to a log file. The log file then can be
post-processed with any statistical means desired, or it can be uploaded
to a spiffy Web site for the world to view.
</p><p>
The system has been up and running since April 2003. Given that it
seems to work fine, I probably should call it a victory and move
on, but I can't help pondering pumpserv2. If I ever get around to it,
I will do a few things differently. A basic flaw
with the current system is it requires an NFS server to serve up
the root filesystem and more importantly, it requires a d&aelig;mon running
on the server to capture the data. A much more robust system would
have the root filesystem local to the pump monitor; the Soekris
Net4501 has a CF slot, so this should be easy. It also would be
desirable to have the d&aelig;mon on the pump monitor log the data locally
and provide this data when requested. This way, if the main server
ever goes down, none of the data is lost.
</p><p> This basic technique could be modified
easily to monitor other devices that draw enough
current to trip the sensor. Some possibilities
include air conditioners, refrigerators, hottub heaters, well pumps, beer coolers&mdash;the
possibilities are endless. Perhaps the most useful
application of this technique
is keeping track of the all-important
coffee level in the office coffeepot, because the
frequency at which the heater cycles is inversely
proportional to the volume of remaining coffee.
</p><p>
