Manage modules separately from the kernel
with a simplified delivery system, and make your

Source is a wonderful thing. Merged module source in the kernel tree is even
better. Most of all, support for that source is what really counts.
In today's explosion of Linux in the enterprise, the ability to
pick up the phone and find help is critical. More than ever, corporations are
driving Linux development and requirements. Often, this meets with
skepticism and a bit of anxiety by the community, but if done correctly,
the benefits are seen and felt by everyone.
</p><p>
The dynamic kernel module support (DKMS) framework should be viewed as a
prime example of this. DKMS, a system designed to help Dell Computer
Corporation
distribute fixes to its customers in a controlled fashion,
also speeds driver development, testing and validation for the entire
community.
</p><p>
The DKMS framework is basically a duplicate tree outside of the kernel tree
that holds module source and compiled module binaries. This
duplication allows for a decoupling of modules from the kernel, which, for
Linux solution and deployment providers, is a powerful tool.
The power comes from permitting driver drops onto existing kernels in an orderly and
supportable manner. In turn, this frees both providers and their customers
from being bound by kernel drops to fix their issues. Instead, when a driver
fix has been released, DKMS serves as a stopgap to distribute the fix
until the code can be merged back into the kernel.
</p><p>
Staying with the customer angle for a bit longer, DKMS offers other advantages.
The business of compiling from source, installing or fidgeting with
rebuildable source RPMs has never been for the faint-of-heart.
The reality is that more Linux users are coming in with less experience,
necessitating simpler solutions. DKMS bridges these issues by creating one
executable that can be called to build, install or uninstall modules.
Further, using its match feature, configuring modules on new kernels could
not be easier, as the modules to install can be based solely on the
configuration of some kernel previously running. In production
environments, this is an immense step forward as IT managers no longer
have to choose between some predefined solution stack or the security
enhancements of a newer kernel.
</p><p>
DKMS also has much to offer developers and veteran Linux users. The
aforementioned idea of the decoupling of modules from the kernel through duplication
(not complete separation) creates a viable test bed for driver development.
Rather than having to push fixes into successive kernels, these fixes can be
distributed and tested on the spot and on a large scale. This speedup in
testing translates to an overall improvement in the speed of general
development. By removing kernel releases as a blocking mechanism to
widespread module code distribution, the result is better tested code that
later can
be pushed back into the kernel at a more rapid pace&mdash;a win for both
developers and users.
</p><p>
DKMS also makes developers' lives easier by simplifying the delivery process
associated with kernel-dependent software. In the past, for example, Dell's
main method for delivering modules was RPMs containing kernel-specific
precompiled modules. As kernel errata emerged, we often were
taken through the monotonous and unending process of recompiling
binaries for these new kernels&mdash;a situation that no developer wants to be
in. However, Dell still favored this delivery mechanism because it minimized
the amount of work and/or knowledge customers needed to have to install
modules. With DKMS, we can meet these usability requirements and
significantly decrease our workload from the development standpoint. DKMS
requires module source code to be located only on the user's system. The
DKMS executable takes care of building and installing the module for any
kernel users may have on their systems, eliminating the kernel catch-up
game.

Using DKMS</h2></div></div><p>
With all of this up-front hype about DKMS, perhaps it might be best to
settle into the particulars of actually how the software is used. First,
using DKMS for a module requires that the module source be located on the
user's system and that it be located in the directory
/usr/src/<span   class="emphasis"><em>(module)</em></span>)-(<span   class="emphasis"><em>(module-version)</em></span>)/.
In addition, a dkms.conf file
must exist with the appropriately formatted directives within this configuration
file to tell DKMS such things as where to install the module and how to
build it. More information on the format of the dkms.conf file can be found
later in this article. Once these two requirements have been met and DKMS
has been installed on the system, the user can begin using DKMS by adding a
module/module-version to the DKMS tree. The example add command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dkms add -m qla2x00 -v v6.04.00
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d0580.0x1ac8920"></a></h2></div></div><p>
would add qla2x00/v6.04.00 to the extant
/var/dkms tree. This command includes creating the directory
/var/dkms/qla2x00/v6.04.00/, creating a symlink from
/var/dkms/qla2x00/v6.04.00/source to &rarr; /usr/src/qla2x00-v6.04.00/ and copying
the dkms.conf file from its original location to
/var/dkms/qla2x00/v6.04.00/dkms.conf.
</p><p>
Once this add is complete, the module is ready to be built. The dkms build command requires that the proper kernel sources
are located on the system from the
/lib/module/<span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel-version</em></span>/build
symlink. The make command used to compile the module is specified in
the dkms.conf configuration file. Continuing with the qla2x00/v6.04.00
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dkms build -m qla2x00 -v v6.04.00 -k 2.4.20-8smp
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d0580.0x1ac8b30"></a></h2></div></div><p>
compiles the module but stops short of installing it. Although build
expects a kernel-version parameter, if this kernel name is left out, it assumes the currently running kernel.
However, building modules for kernels
not currently running also is a viable option. This functionality is
assured through the use of a kernel
preparation subroutine that runs before any module build is performed. This
paranoid kernel preparation involves running a <tt  >make
mrproper</tt>, copying the
proper kernel .config file to the kernel source directory, running a
<tt  >make
oldconfig</tt> and, finally, running a <tt  >make dep</tt>. These steps ensure that the module
being built is built against the proper kernel symbols. By default, DKMS
looks for the kernel .config file in the
/lib/modules/<span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel-version</em></span>/build/configs/ directory, utilizing Red Hat's
naming structure for those config files. If the kernel .config file is not
located in this directory, you must specify a --config option with your
build command and tell DKMS where the .config file can be found.
</p><p>
Successful completion of a build creates, for this example, the
/var/dkms/qla2x00/v6.04.00/2.4.20-8smp/ directory as well as the log and
module subdirectories within this directory. The log directory holds a log
file of the module make, and the module directory holds copies of the
compiled .o binaries.
</p><p>
With the completion of a build, the module now can be installed on the
kernel for which it was built. Installation copies the compiled module
binary to the correct location in the /lib/modules/ tree, as specified in the
dkms.conf file. If a module by that name is already found in that location,
DKMS saves it in its tree as an original module, so it can be
put back into place at a later time if the newer module is uninstalled. The example install
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dkms install -m qla2x00 -v v6.04.00 -k 2.4.20-8smp
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d0580.0x1ac8ea0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
creates the symlink
/var/dkms/qla2x00/v6.04.00/kernel-2.4.20-8smp &rarr;
/var/dkms/qla2x00/v6.04.00/2.4.20-8smp. This symlink is how DKMS keeps tabs
on which driver version is installed on which kernel. As stated earlier, if
a module by the same name is installed already, DKMS saves a copy in its
tree in the /var/dkms/<span   class="emphasis"><em>module-name</em></span>/original_module/ directory.
In this case, it would be saved to
/var/dkms/qla2x00/original_module/2.4.20-8smp/.
</p><p>
To complete the DKMS cycle, you also can uninstall or remove your module
from the tree. Uninstall removes the module you installed and, if
applicable, replaces it with its original module. In scenarios where
multiple versions of a module are located within the DKMS tree, when one
version is uninstalled, DKMS does not try to understand or assume which of
these other versions should be put in its place. Instead, if a true
original_module was saved from the original DKMS installation, it
is put back into the kernel. All of the other module versions for that
module are left in the built state. An example uninstall would be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dkms uninstall -m qla2x00 -v v6.04.00 -k 2.4.20-8smp
</pre>
</p><p>
If the kernel version parameter is unset, the currently running
kernel is assumed, but the same behavior does not occur with the
remove command. Remove and uninstall are similar in that a remove
command completes all of the same steps as does an uninstall. However,
if the module-version being removed is the last instance of that
module-version for all kernels on your system, after the uninstall portion
of the remove completes, remove physically removes all traces of that module
from the DKMS tree. In other words, when an uninstall command
completes, your modules are left in the &ldquo;built&rdquo; state. However, when a
remove completes, you have to start over from the add command before
you can use this module again with DKMS. Here are two sample remove
commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dkms remove -m qla2x00 -v v6.04.00 -k 2.4.20-8smp
dkms remove -m qla2x00 -v v6.04.00 --all
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d0580.0x1ac9210"></a></h2></div></div><p>
With the first remove command, the module would be uninstalled.
If this module/module-version were not installed on any other kernel, all
traces of it would be removed from the DKMS tree. If, say,
qla2x00/v6.04.00 also was installed on the 2.4.20-8bigmem kernel, the first
remove command would leave it alone&mdash;it would remain intact in the DKMS
tree. That would not be the case in the second example. It would uninstall
all versions of the qla2x00/v6.04.00 module from all kernels and then
completely expunge all references of qla2x00/v6.04.00 from the DKMS tree.
Thus, remove is what cleans your DKMS tree.

Miscellaneous DKMS Commands</h2></div></div><p>
DKMS also comes with a fully functional status command that returns
information about what is currently located in your tree. If no parameters
are set, it returns all information found. Logically, the specificity of
information returned depends on which parameters are passed to your status
command. Each status entry returned is of the state added, built
or installed. If an original module has been saved, this information
also is displayed. Some example status commands include:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dkms status
dkms status -m qla2x00
dkms status -m qla2x00 -v v6.04.00
dkms status -k 2.4.20-8smp
dkms status -m qla2x00 -v v6.04.00 -k 2.4.20-8smp
</pre>
</p><p>
Another major feature of DKMS is the match command. The match command takes
the configuration of DKMS-installed modules for one kernel and applies
it to some other kernel. When the match completes, the same
module/module-versions installed for one kernel are then
installed on the other kernel. This is helpful when you are upgrading from
one kernel to the next but want to keep the same DKMS modules in
place for the new kernel. In the example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dkms match --templatekernel 2.4.20-8smp
&#8618;-k 2.4.20-9smp
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d0580.0x1ac9528"></a></h2></div></div><p>
--templatekernel is the
match-er kernel
from which the configuration is based. The -k kernel is the
match-ee
upon which the configuration is instated.
</p><p>
For systems management purposes, the commands mktarball and ldtarball also have
been added to DKMS. These commands allow the user to make and load
tarball archives, respectively, into the DKMS tree to facilitate using
DKMS in deployments where many similar systems exist. This allows the system
administrator to build modules on only one system. Rather than
build the same module on every other system, the
built binary can be applied directly to the other systems' DKMS
tree.
Specifically, mktarball creates a tarball of the source for a given
module/module-version. It then archives the DKMS tree of every kernel
version that has a module built for that module/module-version. Consider
the
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dkms mktarball -m qla2x00 -v v6.04.00
&#8618;-k 2.4.20-8smp,2.4.20-8
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d0580.0x1ac9738"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Depending on the -k kernel parameter, mktarball archives only certain
binaries compiled for those kernels specified. If no kernel parameter is
given, it archives all built module binaries for that module/module-version.
</p><p>
With ldtarball, DKMS simply parses the archive created with mktarball and
applies whatever is found to that system's DKMS tree. This leaves all
modules in the built state; the dkms install command then can be used
to place the module binaries into the /lib/modules tree. Under normal
operation, ldtarball does not overwrite any files that already exist in the
system's DKMS tree. However, the archive can be forced over what is in the
tree with the --force option. An example ldtarball:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dkms ldtarball --config
&#8618;qla2x00-v6.04.00-kernel2.4.20-8smp.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
The last miscellaneous DKMS command is mkdriverdisk. As can be inferred from
its name, mkdriverdisk takes the proper sources in your DKMS tree and
creates a driver disk image that can provide updated drivers to Linux
distribution installations. A sample mkdriverdisk might look like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dkms mkdriverdisk -d redhat -m qla2x00
&#8618;-v v6.04.00 -k 2.4.20-8BOOT
</pre>
</p><p>
Currently, the only supported distribution driver disk format is Red Hat,
but this easily could expand with some help from the community in
understanding driver disk requirements and formats on a per-distribution
basis. For more information on the extra necessary files and their formats
for DKMS to create Red Hat driver disks, see
<a href="http://people.redhat.com/dledford" target="_self">people.redhat.com/dledford</a>. These files should be placed in your
module source directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d0580.0x1ac9a50"></a>
The dkms.conf Configuration File Format</h2></div></div><p>
For maintainers of DKMS packages, the dkms.conf configuration file is the
only auxiliary piece necessary to make your source tarball DKMS-ready. The
format of the conf file is a successive list of shell variables
sourced by DKMS when working with your package. For example, an excerpt
from the qla2x00/v6.04.00 dkms.conf file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
MAKE="make all
&#8618;INCLUDEDIR=/lib/modules/$kernelver/build/include"
MAKE_smp="make SMP=1 all
&#8618;INCLUDEDIR=/lib/modules/$kernelver/build/include"
LOCATION="/kernel/drivers/addon/qla2200"
REMAKE_INITRD="yes"
MODULE_NAME="qla2200.o:qla2200_6x.o
&#8618;qla2300.o:qla2300_6x.o"
CLEAN="make clean"
MODULES_CONF_ALIAS_TYPE="scsi_hostadapter"
MODULES_CONF0="options scsi_mod
&#8618;scsi_allow_ghost_devices=1"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d0580.0x1ac9bb0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
shows that each of the shell variable directives should be coded in all capital
letters. One of the current exceptions to this rule is the MAKE_ directive.
DKMS uses the generic MAKE= command to build your module. But, if a
MAKE_<span   class="emphasis"><em>kernel-regexp-text</em></span> command exists and the text after the MAKE_
matches (as a substring) the kernel for which it is being built,
then this alternate make command is used. In the above example, you can see
how DKMS would use the MAKE_smp directive on any smp kernel for which it
was building this module. Similar PATCH_ commands also exist. When the
text after the underscore matches the kernel for which a module is being
built, that patch first is applied to the module source. This allows
developers to distribute one source tarball, with one dkms.conf and multiple
patches. Yet, different patches can be applied as necessary to the source to
ensure all modules function correctly on all kernels.
</p><p>
Also notice that dkms.conf accepts the $kernelver variable, which, at build
time, is replaced with the kernel version for which the module is being
built. This is especially important so the correct include directories
are referenced when compiling a module for a kernel that is not currently
running.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19d0580.0x1ec1fb8"></a>
Using DKMS in Conjunction with RPM</h2></div></div><p>
DKMS and RPM actually work quite well together. The only twist is that to
make it function properly, you have to create an RPM that installs
source. Although normal practice is to install source only with source RPMs, a
source RPM does not necessarily work with DKMS; it will not let you
do much besides install the source. Instead, your source tarball
needs to be included with your RPM, so your source can be placed in
/usr/src/<span   class="emphasis"><em>module</em></span>-<span   class="emphasis"><em>module-version</em></span>/ and the proper DMKS commands can be
called. The %post and %preun basically are DKMS commands.
Here is a sample .spec file:

<pre     class="programlisting">

In the December 2002 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Linus Torvalds was quoted as
saying, &ldquo;Basically, all of the commercial people have their own agenda, and
that's very healthy because you want to have these often-conflicting agendas
to push the system into something that actually works for
everybody.&rdquo; As a
commercial reseller of Linux-enabled products, Dell is interested in
finding a good solution to the ongoing module/kernel issue, both to support
the community and to create a better Linux experience for their customers.
DKMS was designed with this in mind.
