LISP and Java programmers take garbage collection for granted. With
the Boehm-Demers-Weiser library, you easily can use it in C and C++
projects, too.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1ea01e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The first word that came to mind when I
heard about introducing Garbage Collection techniques into a C or C++
program was &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo;. As with any other decent C programmer
who loves this
language, the thought of leaving
the management of my own memory to others seemed nearly offensive. I had a
similar feeling 15 years ago, when I first heard about
compilers that would generate assembly code on my
behalf. I was used to writing my code directly in 6510 opcodes, but that
was Commodore 64&mdash;and a totally different story.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1ea0348"></a>What Is Garbage Collection?</h2></div></div><p>
Garbage Collection (GC) is a mechanism that provides
automatic memory reclamation for unused memory blocks.
Programmers dynamically allocate memory, but
when a block is no longer needed, they do not
have to return it to the system explicitly with
a free() call. The GC engine takes care of
recognizing that a particular block of allocated
memory (heap) is not used anymore and puts it
back into the free memory area. GC
was introduced by John McCarthy in 1958, as the memory
management mechanism of the LISP language. Since
then, GC algorithms have evolved and now can
compete with explicit memory management. Several
languages are natively based on GC. Java
probably is the most popular one, and others include
LISP, Scheme, Smalltalk, Perl and Python. C and
C++, in the tradition of a respectable, low-level approach to system resources management,
are the most notable exceptions to this list.
</p><p>
Many different approaches to garbage
collection exist, resulting in some families of
algorithms that include reference counting,
mark and sweep and copying GCs. Hybrid
algorithms, as well as generational
and conservative variants, complete the
picture. Choosing a particular GC algorithm
usually is not a programmer's task, as the
memory management system is imposed by the adopted
programming language. An exception to this rule is
the Boehm-Demers-Weiser (BDW) GC library, a
popular package that allows C and C++ programmers
to include automatic memory management into their
programs. The question is: Why would they want to
do a thing like this?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1ea04a8"></a>
The Boehm-Demers-Weiser GC Library</h2></div></div><p>
The BDW library is a freely available library that
provides C and C++ programs with garbage collection capabilities. The
algorithm it employs belongs to the family of mark and sweep
collectors, where GC is split into two phases. First, a scan of all the
live memory is done in order to mark unused blocks. Then, a
sweep phase takes care of putting the marked blocks in the free
blocks list. The two phases can be, and usually are, performed separately to increase the general response time of the library. The BDW
algorithm also is generational; it concentrates free space searches on
newer blocks. This is based on the idea
that older blocks statistically live longer. To put it another way, most
allocated blocks have short lifetimes. Finally, the BDW algorithm
is conservative in that it needs to make assumptions on which
variables are actually pointers to dynamic data and which ones
only look that way. This is a consequence of C and C++ being weakly
typed languages.
</p><p>
The BDW collector comes as a static or dynamic library and is
installed easily by downloading the corresponding package (see Resources) and
running the traditional configure, make and make install commands. Some
Linux distributions also come with an already-made package. For example,
with Gentoo you need to type only <tt  >emerge boehm-gc</tt> to
install it. The
installed files include both a shared object (libgc.o) and a static
library (libgc.a).
</p><p>
Using the library is a fairly straightforward task; for newly developed
programs, you simply call GC_alloc() to get memory and then forget
about it when you do not need it anymore. &ldquo;Forget about
it&rdquo;
means setting all the pointers that reference it to NULL. For already
existing sources, substitute all allocation calls
(malloc, calloc, realloc) with the GC-endowed ones. All
free() calls are replaced with nothing at all, but do set any relevant pointers
to NULL.
</p><p>
GC_alloc() actually sets the allocated
memory to zero to minimize the risk that
preexisting values are misinterpreted as valid pointers by the GC
engine. Hence, GC_alloc() behaves more like calloc()
than malloc().
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1ea0768"></a>
Using GC in Existing C Programs</h2></div></div><p>
If you want to try GC in an existing application, manually
editing the source code to change mallocs and frees is not necessary. In
order to redirect those calls to the GC version, you basically have
three options: using a macro, modifying the malloc hooks and overriding
glibc's malloc() with libgc's malloc(). The first approach is the easiest
one;
you simply need to insert something like:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

#define malloc(x) GC_malloc(x)
#define calloc(n,x) GC_malloc((n)*(x))
#define realloc(p,x) GC_realloc((p),(x))
#define free(x) (x) = NULL

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1ea08c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
into the appropriate include files. This code substitutes only the explicit
calls contained in your code, leaving startup and library allocations
to traditional malloc/free calls.
</p><p>
A different approach is to hook malloc and friends to functions of your
own, which in turn would call the GC versions. Listing 1
shows how to do it, and it can be linked directly to an existing program. See
my article &ldquo;Advanced Memory Allocation&rdquo;
[<i  >LJ</i>, May 2003] for details on these hooks. With this
method, any heap allocation is guaranteed to go through libgc, even if it is
not performed directly by your code.

As a third alternative, you can pass --enable-redirect-malloc to
<b  >configure</b> before compiling the libgc library. Doing so
provides the library with wrapper functions that have the same names as the standard glibc
malloc family. When linking with your code, the functions in libgc
override the standard ones, with a net effect similar to using malloc
hooks. In this case, though, the effect is system-wise, as any program
linked with libgc is affected by the change.
</p><p>
Do not expect to endow huge programs with GC easily using any of these
methods. Some simple tricks are needed in order to exploit GC functions
and help the collector algorithm work efficiently. For example,
I tried to recompile gawk (version 3.1.1) using GC and obtained
an executable ten times slower than the original. With some adjustments,
such as setting each pointer to NULL after having freed it, the execution
time improved significantly, even if it was still greater than the
original time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1ea0ef8"></a>
Garbage Collection in New Programs</h2></div></div><p>
If you are developing a new program and would like to take advantage
of automated memory management, all you need to do is use the
GC_malloc() family in place of the plain malloc() one and link with
libgc. Memory blocks no longer needed simply can be disposed
of by setting any referencing pointers to NULL. Alternatively, you can call
GC_free() to free the block immediately.
</p><p>
Always remember that your whole heap is scanned periodically by
the collector to look for unused blocks. If the heap is large, this
operation may take some time, causing the performance of the program to
degrade. This behavior is suboptimal, because large blocks
of memory often are guaranteed never to contain pointers, including buffers
used for file or network I/O and large strings. Typically, pointers are
contained only in fixed positions within small data structures, such
as list
and tree nodes. Were C and C++ strongly typed languages,
the collector could have decided whether to scan
a memory block, based on the type of pointer. Unfortunately,
this is not possible because it is perfectly legal in C to have a char
pointer reference a list node.
</p><p>
For optimal performance, the programmer should try
to provide some basic runtime type information to the collector.
To this end, the BDW library has a set of alternative functions
that can be used to allocate memory. GC_malloc_atomic() can be used
in place of GC_malloc() to obtain memory blocks that will never contain
valid pointers. That is, the collector skips those blocks when looking
for live memory references. Furthermore, those blocks do not need
to be cleared on allocation. GC_malloc_uncollectable() and
GC_malloc_stubborn() also can be used to allocate fixed and rarely
changing blocks, respectively. Finally, it is possible to provide
some rough type information by using GC_malloc_explicitly_typed()
and building block maps with GC_make_descriptor().
See gc_typed.h on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP site for more
information [available at <a href="../listings/113/6679.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue113/6679.tgz</a>].
</p><p>
The collector's behavior also can be controlled by the user through a
number of function calls and variables. Among the most useful ones are
GC_gcollect(), which forces a full garbage collection on the whole
heap; GC_enable_incremental(), which enables incremental mode
collection; and GC_free_space_divisor, which tunes
the trade-off between frequent collections (high values, causing low
heap expansion and high CPU overhead) and time efficiency (low values).
</p><p>
Heap status and debug information is available through a number of
functions, including GC_get_heap_size(), GC_get_free_bytes(),
GC_get_bytes_since_gc(), GC_get_total_bytes() and
GC_dump(). Many of these parameters and functions are not documented at all,
not even in the source code itself. As always, a good editor is your friend.

Performance and Behavior</h2></div></div><p>
A single best approach to memory management that is effective
for any program does not exist. Given a specific application, the optimal solution
must be found by compromising on a number of different
factors, including CPU overhead, heap expansion, allocation latency and,
last but not least, manageability and robustness of the code. Profiling
the program and testing different memory strategies probably is the best
solution for dealing with these issues.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1ea1318"></a>Garbage Collection and Compiler Optimizations</h2></div></div><p>
One subtle point against GC is it requires extra care if
compiler
optimizations are switched on. The collector
may wrongly assume a certain pointer has disappeared simply because
references to
it have been optimized out. Thus, the corresponding memory block might be
freed
even if it still is in use by the program, with the obvious consequences.
Hence,
it might be tempting to turn compiler optimizations off to be safe,
losing
part of the performance gain obtained by using GC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1ea1420"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In order to have an idea of the behavior and performance of GC vs.
traditional memory management, we have experimented with a test program,
gctest, which loops over the creation and destruction of a simple
list. Simple as it may seem, the test raises some interesting points. The
source code is not really instructive and is too long to be printed, so it
is available for download on the FTP site (<a href="../listings/113/6679.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue113/6679.tgz</a>).
</p><p>
<b  >gctest</b> can be controlled with a number of options that allow you
to experiment with different list lengths and node sizes, as well as to
change working parameters&mdash;enabling and disabling specific features of
the GC library. Before we comment on the results we obtained with this
test tool, it is important to point out that they were obtained in an
artificial and not excessively realistic environment. So, again, you
are invited to test the GC library yourself and evaluate it for your
own code. Take the parameters presented here as possible indicators
of the library suitability to a particular application.
</p><p>
The measurements we collected are overall execution time, the
CPU load; heap expansion, how much memory is requested by the
system with respect to how much actually was allocated by the program;
and allocation latency average and standard deviation, how long
it takes to allocate a single block of memory and how much this time
varies across different allocations. The meaning of the first parameter
is quite obvious and needs no further explanation. Heap expansion
is a measure of how much of the allocated memory is fragmented
and what amount of extra memory is requested by the library from the
operating system. As we will see, the library may allocate a 1MB
block ten times, freeing it after each allocation and requesting a total of
10MB of the system, as if freed memory was
not put back on the free list. Although this sometimes is desired
behavior, needed to optimize the allocation strategy, it can
be annoying on systems with a limited availability of RAM. It can become a
further source of CPU overhead if swap space is involved. Finally,
allocation latency is important for real-time applications,
which need the longest allocation time to be bounded. Typical cases are
multimedia playback applications and specialized embedded systems that
need to react to external events in a predictable amount of time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1ea1688"></a>
Some Comments on the Results</h2></div></div><p>
Our test box A is a Pentium 4 2.53GHz system, with 1GB of RAM running Gentoo
Linux (all code is optimized for the CPU architecture) and glibc 2.3,
which has an improved memory management algorithm over glibc 2.2. Test
box B is a K6-II 400MHz laptop with 128MB of RAM, running Slackware
Linux with glibc 2.2.
</p><p>
Our first test consisted of allocating a list of 150,000 nodes, 16
bytes each, 30 times. On each loop, the allocated list was destroyed,
that is, free()ed in case of traditional management, unlinked in case of
GC. The test commands were:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

gctest -tu -s 4 -n 150000 -l 30

</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1ea1840"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and:

<pre     class="programlisting">

gctest -gu -s 4 -n 150000 -l 30

</pre>
</p><p>
The overall execution time, on box A, was 3.80 seconds with traditional
management and 2.43 seconds with GC, an improvement of about 35%.
The same test performed on box B showed an even
greater improvement, around 40%. This first test shows that, contrary to
popular belief, GC actually can be quite faster than malloc/free. Heap
expansion is rather limited and amounts to about 2 in both cases. What
is even more surprising is that allocation latency is the same&mdash;6.7
microseconds&mdash;with a slightly larger deviation for the GC case.
Also interesting is that by calling GC_gcollect() at each
loop (option -G), the overall execution time decreases by 0.1
second. This result is counterintuitive, because we have one more function call
in the loop.
</p><p>
Now, let's see what happens if we forget to destroy the list at the
end of each loop. In the traditional management case, the test executes
faster, 2.58 vs. 3.80 seconds, but the peak heap expansion is 140MB,
which is twice the overall allocated memory. In the GC case, the test aborts
due to memory exhaustion unless we call for an explicit collection (-G)
at the end of each loop. By doing so, we obtain the lowest execution
time, 2.32 seconds. This probably is quite far from what we could have
imagined a priori&mdash;that's why actual
experimentation is important for finding the optimal solutions.
</p><p>
The same test also has been performed on box B, but with an unoptimized
Slackware distribution and glibc 2.2. It is interesting that
although the improvement of GC over malloc/free still was around 40%,
the test ran 27% faster under Gentoo.
</p><p>
The second test we made shows some limitations of the GC library. The test
conditions actually were quite extreme: we tried to allocate five lists,
each having 1,500,000 nodes, with each node being 16 bytes long. Although
the malloc/free version ran correctly, the GC version did not complete
the test because of memory exhaustion. The problem probably is due to
the large number of blocks consecutively allocated.
</p><p>
The third test used larger nodes, 140 bytes each, and a shorter list
length, 150,000 nodes. We ran:

<pre     class="programlisting">

gctest -tu -s 128 -n 150000 -l 5

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1ea1c08"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and:

<pre     class="programlisting">

gctest -gu -s 128 -n 150000 -l 5

</pre>
</p><p>
Under these conditions, the improvement of GC over malloc/free was around
20%, 0.85 vs. 0.60 seconds. Recall, though, the GC
library always clears the allocated blocks, but malloc() does not. The
overhead associated with this operation grows linearly with node size
and thus is more important with larger nodes. To make a fair
comparison, then, we need to substitute malloc() with calloc() at those points
where GC_malloc() is called, as happens in:

<pre     class="programlisting">

gctest -tuc -s 128 -n 150000 -l 5

</pre>
</p><p>
This test yields an execution time of 0.88 seconds and brings the GC
improvement to 32%. Heap expansion is greater in the GC case, with a
value of 1.7 vs. 1.0. Allocation latency is practically the same for both
traditional and GC management, although a larger latency variation
was experienced in the latter. Enabling incremental collection (-i option) did
not lower the variation, although introducing calls to GC_free() (-F option)
to explicitly free the list nodes explicitly actually did yield better results than
the malloc/free case, on both execution time and latency.
However, in this case we are not strictly using a real
garbage collection approach.
</p><p>
Testing even larger memory blocks makes the difference between
traditional and GC memory management quite noticeable. On 4KB
nodes,
GC performed quite poorly in comparison with malloc/free on execution time,
0.85 vs. 2 seconds; heap expansion, 2.75 vs. 1; and latency, 0.7
milliseconds vs. 1.6 microseconds. When compared with calloc/free
performance, the execution time of GC still is quite competitive (40%
faster). But, issues related to heap and latency remain.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
GC techniques often are surrounded by myths and
legends. In this article we have shown that GC actually can perform
better than malloc/free. These advantages do not come for free, however,
and the correct use of the library requires minimum knowledge on its
internal mechanisms.
</p><p>
There is no final verdict on the suitability of GC for C programs. For now, the
BDW library can be one more tool in your box, to be given
serious consideration the next time you deal with a complex piece
of software. Several open-source projects, like the Mono Project and
GNU gcj Java runtime, have been using it for a while.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1da8580.0x1e98968"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Pros and Cons</b></p><p>
Before deciding that GC is for wimps and a hard-core C programmer
would never need it, it may be beneficial to consider the actual
advantages GC may offer with respect to the traditional C/C++ memory
management schemes. As Ellis and Stroustrup say in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Annotated
C++ Reference Manual</em></span>, &ldquo;C programmers
think memory management is too important to be left to the computer. LISP
programmers think memory management is too important to be left to the
user.&rdquo;
</p><p>
That memory-related problems contain some of the most
insidious and time-wasting bugs a C programmer can encounter is a
well-known fact. Even
an experienced programmer might have a hard time tracking down
bugs caused by invalid accesses, overflowing writes, accesses to
dead memory,
memory leaks and the like. Furthermore, from a
software design point of view, the need to prevent such situations often
leads designers to unclean interfaces between modules that should be
decoupled. Think of functions that return a dynamically allocated
memory block that then must be freed by the caller or a pointer to
an internal static buffer, spoiling threadsafety&mdash;strtok() is
a typical example in this sense&mdash;not to mention problems arising from
memory areas shared among several modules. Each module has to free such
areas only if no other modules are or will be using it, resulting in a
tighter coupling between the modules themselves. This problem usually is
addressed by using reference counting, where an internal counter is
kept for each active user of the area; multiple copies, where
one copy of the area is kept for each module; or, for those who fancy C++,
smart pointers.
</p><p>
GC is an effective way
of dealing with memory-related problems in C, relieving the programmer of memory
accounting burdens. Each memory block knows when it is in use, actually,
the GC engine knows, and the block automatically disappears when it
is not referenced anymore. GC eliminates a
priori all premature frees
and memory leak problems.
</p><p>
GC has some drawbacks, of course, the most annoying being the feeling of
having lost control that afflicts C programmers. More concretely, drawbacks
stem from the automated management of resources, which translates into:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Not knowing when an unused memory block actually is freed and if it
ever will be. This has further consequences when the memory block is
a C++ object, whose destructor is called at an unspecified time.
</p></li><li><p>
Not being able to determine in advance how much time an allocation
takes (allocation latency and jitter), which often is an issue
for real-time systems. It must be said, though, that traditional malloc()
also presents this problem sometimes. Incremental GC can help
alleviate the problem and provide limited constraints to allocation times.
</p></li><li><p>
Longer execution time due to GC processing overhead. This often is not
true, as sometimes the overhead associated with traditional free()s
is equal to or even greater than that of GC. In this sense, only storage
allocators written specifically for a given program might be
faster. Even so, programmers often write their
own memory management systems without a preliminary profiling activity,
sometimes resulting in negative effects on performance.
</p></li><li><p>
Higher memory fragmentation (heap expansion), caused by unused objects
not being freed by the GC engine when more memory is allocated by the
program. It is quite common to have a heap much larger than the amount
of memory in actual use at a certain time. Even worse, the heap size
sometimes is proportional to the total amount of allocation performed
since the program started. This may be a serious issue on systems with
scarce RAM availability, where frequent collections and explicit free()
calls might be necessary to limit fragmentation.

Reduced locality of reference, due to the garbage detection phase that
has to traverse the whole addressable heap space to look for unused
blocks. This results in cache and virtual memory misses more often
than happens with traditional allocations. Generational GC algorithms limit
the severity of this problem.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
GC enthusiasts claim that these issues are not
so relevant, considering the cleaner design and
greater robustness that GC offers. Even
if these advantages are difficult to be
evaluated concretely, they sometimes provide a convenient
trade-off between code manageability and loss
of resources.

Finally, the BDW library also can be used proficiently as a leak detector;
the Mozilla team uses it this way, for example. For more information,
have a look at the included documentation.
