We're clearly on the upside of the wireless wave, with new installations
happening across the country and around the world every day.
Like many technologies in an early emergent phase,
providers still seem to be at a loss as to how to get the word out that
they're making this valuable service available. Discovering the wireless
networks in your community on your own can be a challenge. If you live in
an urban area, it's likely that hundreds of publicly accessible
wireless networks are just waiting for you to log in. If you live in a rural
area, they may be harder to come by, but they're there. What you need is
a set of tools to help you find and use the networks made publicly
available for your convenience.
</p><p>
The first tool, of course, is the computer itself. Because of the near
ubiquity, increasing power and decreasing size of laptops, they've
become the tool of choice for wireless discovery. Or, you can go with the
PDA. Though classified as a PDA (or,
in the marketing parlance of Sharp, a Personal Mobile Tool) the power
of the Zaurus makes it a de facto desktop in a pocket size. Armed with
the proper software tools, the Zaurus is much lighter on the wrists
and arms for discovering networks, while sacrificing virtually nothing
in power.
</p><p>
The software tool of choice for discovering wireless networks with the Zaurus is
Kismet, available as a .tar.gz file from <a href="http://killefiz.de/zaurus" target="_self">killefiz.de/zaurus</a>. Kismet
can be used in tandem with Kismet-Qt, a clean and extremely friendly
GUI interface that provides all the information you need to sniff
and connect to the wireless networks in your community.
You don't need a Zaurus to use Kismet; it works
under any Linux system.
</p><p>
For a quick taste of the Kismet command-line interface, slide your
wireless CF card into the CF slot and, from the terminal mode, enter
<tt  >kismet</tt> as root.
Your network card will begin to flash rapidly, indicating that Kismet
is sniffing for wireless networks by analyzing all packets it encounters.
</p><p>
The Kismet command-line application indicates the number of networks in
close proximity, as well as the number of packets received and how
many of those packets are encrypted. To configure the command-line
tool to your particular preferences, use vi to edit
/home/root/usr/etc/kismet.conf. This is a well-commented configuration
file, providing detailed instructions for each configurable element of
Kismet. There are many, all of which are applicable to your use
of Kismet-Qt.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6861f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Kismet Command-Line Interface
</p></div></div><p>
Installation of the Kismet-Qt application is a bit more straightforward. With the
.ipk file downloaded and transferred to your Zaurus, the file appears in the Add/Remove Software option within the Tools tab. By default,
the file actually is stored at /home/zaurus/Documents/Install_Files. You
can select the application from the Add/Remove Software window, select
install and your install location (internal Flash or an external storage
device), then let the Zaurus do the heavy lifting for you. If you'd
prefer to install the file using the terminal application, change to this
directory and follow the ipkg instructions above to install.
</p><p>
Command-line Kismet installs a server from which the Kismet-Qt application
pulls its information. If the Kismet server isn't running,
Kismet-Qt throws an error noting it was unable to connect
to this server. So, you need to start the server from the terminal
window as above, then open the Kismet-Qt interface by selecting it from
the applications button in the lower-left corner of your Zaurus screen.
With the Kismet-Qt package installed and Kismet running in your terminal
window, you're ready to start discovering open wireless networks. Let's
take a look at the Kismet-Qt interface.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6861f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Kismet-Qt Interface
</p></div></div><p>
As shown in Figure 2, the Kismet-Qt interface is broken out into
four main tabs. These tabs display the current network activity, a
statistical summary of all current activity, a summary of all special
strings detected and a configuration screen. These tabs provide more
than enough detail for most users to detect and connect to community
wireless networks. Let's take a look at some of these tabs individually.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6861f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Kismet-Qt Results Tab
</p></div></div><p>
Kismet-Qt retains the data on all network activity detected during the
current session. This data is presented in the Results tab in collapsible
form, identified at the top level by the network name (or ESSID). Although
the Results tab provides a wealth of information, a caveat or two is
in order when viewing discovered networks. In cases where the wireless
network does not utilize an ESSID, the default name is displayed
within angle brackets. Seeing a name within the list such as
&ldquo;linksys&rdquo;
may be an indication that you've stumbled upon a private wireless
network operating in the manufacturer's default configuration. Although
the owner's intention may be to provide this service to the community,
tread lightly. If there's any question about the purpose of the network,
avoid using the network you've detected.
</p><p>
The Results tab provides virtually all the information you need to
establish a connection with an open wireless network. We'll discuss
these items in a bit. In particular, you need to note the ESSID,
whether the signal is WAP-encrypted, the IP-address range and the
channel on which the network is operating. These are your keys to
the wireless kingdom. You also may want to pay attention to the signal strength
figures and the time the last activity was detected (&ldquo;last
seen&rdquo;). This
data will provide wireless users on the move with an indication of their
relative location to the hot spot. A weaker signal indicates you're
on the fringe of the hot spot, moving either in or out.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6861f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The Kismet-Qt Stats Tab
</p></div></div><p>
Kismet-Qt provides a clean interface to display the aggregate current
wireless activity. This data includes the number of wireless networks
currently within range, both the total number of packets received and
the number that are encrypted, the signal noise level and the current
packets-per-second receipt rate. Because this is an aggregate summary of
the current activity, these numbers can be very high when encountering
overlapping wireless zones. The rate-per-second figure, as with the
signal strength and last seen figures above, can provide some indication
of the user's movement into and out of the heart of a network.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6861f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Kismet-Qt Config Tab
</p></div></div><p>
The Config tab in Kismet-Qt contains the most critical data for
making the Zaurus a wireless sniffer. You can select the system ROM type
(Sharp or OpenZaurus) and the type of CF card you're using. Most common
CF wireless cards are covered in the card type options, though you can
modify the settings manually with the Other option if your card does not
utilize one of the listed protocols. You also can select the operating
channel from a list that provides the option of listening for specific
individual channels or all US or international channels. The latter two
options listen across the range of the US or international channels
for any with current activity. Perhaps the most utilitarian option in
the Config tab is the ability to beep when
a new network is discovered.
</p><p>
The depth of the data provided by the Kismet/Kismet-Qt
combination is quite rich. The tools provide all the data you need to
sniff, connect to and utilize wireless networks in your community.
Community wireless is coming to a town near
you. With a Zaurus, Kismet and a wireless CF
card, you can leverage the power of Linux to stay
connected nearly anywhere.
