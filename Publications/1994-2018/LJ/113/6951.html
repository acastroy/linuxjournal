Remember how fun it was to get your first Net
connection working? It's like that.

How about a project that combines hardware
construction, community building, network hacking
and, of course, Linux and other free software?
Best of all, the stuff you need to get started
is cheap and standardized, and there's a great
balance of helpful resources and unanswered
questions. We're talking about wireless networks.
You'll impress even people who aren't Linux users
by offering convenient Net access at your business
or organization and the public spaces nearby.
</p><p>
Here on the West Coast of the USA, people sometimes
get complacent about being first to understand and
deploy new technology. If you're in San Francisco
or Seattle, you're bound to be living a couple
years ahead of everyone else, gadget-wise, right?
Wrong.
</p><p>
Even though the West Coast has some wireless
users groups that have done some impressive work,
wireless is really making an impact in New York
City, where &ldquo;business improvement districts&rdquo;
are using access points to improve business in
their neighborhoods, and even the phone company
is offering access points. NYCwireless is a force
to be reckoned with and might give you some ideas
for your town. Find out exactly what that beat box on the cover has
to do with Linux, and learn about the wireless
frenzy sweeping New York City, on page 42.
</p><p>
When Doc's article has you typing &ldquo;LGA&rdquo; into
your favorite travel site, be sure to pack your
favorite Linux PDA or laptop, and bring along
a copy of Kismet. Tony Steidler-Dennison shows
you how to discover all the wireless resources
available to you, on page 58.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the author of Kismet, Mike Kershaw,
explains how to set up your very own access point,
with NoCatAuth and a friendly login screen for
security, on page 52. If you merely leave your
access point open, people might hesitate to use
it because they're polite or don't know what your
intentions are. Change its name to something with
&ldquo;public&rdquo; or &ldquo;open&rdquo; in it, and put up NoCatAuth so
that people can sign in and understand the terms
under which they're allowed to use it.
</p><p>
As always, networks are most useful and fun
when you can connect them to real-world devices.
Tad Truex has a sump pump on the Web, and you can
learn to hook up your own electrical appliances
on page 38. Remember, safety first, and read the
part about not burning your house down.
</p><p>
Often, you need a big directory that handles
everyone's information for your business, and the
last thing you want is to get locked in to some
vendor's idea of how to do it, so naturally you've
been reading Mick Bauer's series on OpenLDAP. This
month, on page 32, Mick finishes the series. If you're a new
subscriber, check out <a href="http://interactive.linuxjournal.com" target="_self">interactive.linuxjournal.com</a>
for the previous two articles in the series.
</p><p>
Finally, don't miss the chance to get your Web
site onto a content management system (CMS)
that helps everyone do his or her job better
and release pages to the public at the right
time. Reuven Lerner offers Bricolage for your
consideration on page 16.
