In the conclusion of his series on LDAP, Mick
takes the secure LDAP server project to the point
where it can authenticate real users for real
applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x26ff298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
For the past couple of months in the Paranoid Penguin column, we've been building
an LDAP server. We've installed OpenLDAP; configured slapd, the server
d&aelig;mon; made TLS encryption work; and created our first LDAP record, a
root organization entry. Now, it's time to add some users
and start using our server for authenticating IMAP sessions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x26ff3a0"></a>
Database Structure</h2></div></div><p>
The first step in creating an LDAP user database is to decide on a
directory structure, including whether to group users and other entities or
use a completely flat structure. If your LDAP database
is strictly an on-line address book or authentication server,
a flat database may suffice. In that case, your users' Distinguished Names
(DNs) should look like this: <tt  >dn=Mick
Bauer,dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org</tt>.
</p><p>
If, however, your database contains information not only about
individual users but also records for organizational subgroups or
departments, for computers on your network and so on, you'll probably
want to use a more sophisticated directory tree structure. There
are a variety of ways to do this. One is by using domainComponent
(dc) fields to create subdomains of your domain name, regardless
of whether these actually exist in DNS. The method looks like <tt  >dn=Bick
Mauer,dc=engineering,dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org</tt>. Another is to use
organizationalUnit objects in the same way, for example, <tt  >dn=Dick
Lauer,ou=engineering,dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org</tt>.
</p><p>
In order to keep this discussion simple, I use a flat database
for the rest of the article; I leave it to you to determine whether and
how to structure an LDAP database that best meets your particular LDAP
needs. The documentation found at <a href="http://www.openldap.org" target="_self">www.openldap.org</a> and included with
OpenLDAP software provides ample examples.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x26ff6b8"></a>
Schema and User Records</h2></div></div><p>
Another decision you need to make is which LDAP attributes you
want to include for each record. Last month, I described how these are
grouped and interrelated in schemas. You may recall that the schemas
you specify, or include, in /etc/openldap/slapd.conf determine which
attributes are available for you to use in records.
</p><p>
In addition to including schema in /etc/openldap/slapd.conf, in
each record you create you need to use objectClass statements to
associate the appropriate schemas with each user. Again, as discussed
last time, the schema files in /etc/openldap/schema determine which
schema support which attributes, and within a given schema, which object
classes to which those attributes apply.
</p><p>
Suppose you intend to use your LDAP server to authenticate IMAP
connections. The essential LDAP attributes for this purpose are uid
and userPassword. This also holds true for any other application that
authenticates to LDAP using the Bind method, in which the authenticating
service simply attempts to bind to the LDAP server using the user name
and password supplied by the user. If the bind succeeds, authentication
is judged successful, and the LDAP connection is closed.
</p><p>
One way to determine which schema and object classes provide uid and
userPassword is to <tt  >grep</tt> the contents of /etc/openldap/schema for
the strings uid and userPassword, note which files contain them and
then manually parse those files to find the object classes that contain
those attributes in MUST() or MAY() statements. If I do this for
uid on a Red Hat 7.3 system running OpenLDAP 2.0, I find that the files
core.schema, cosine.schema, inetorgperson.schema, nis.schema
and openldap.schema contain references to the uid attribute.
</p><p>
Quick scans of these files (using <tt  >less</tt>) tell me the
following: core.schema's
object uidObject requires uid; cosine.schema's only reference
to the attribute uid is commented out and can be disregarded;
inetorgperson.schema contains an object class, inetOrgPerson, that
supports uid as an optional attribute; nis.schema contains two object
classes, posixAccount and shadowAccount, both of which require uid;
and openldap.schema's object class OpenLDAPperson also requires uid.
</p><p>
Luckily, there's a much faster way to determine the same information.
The gq LDAP tool allows you to browse all supported attributes in all
supported schema on your LDAP server. Figure 1 is a screenshot
illustrating my LDAP server's support for uid, according to gq.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6936f1.large.jpg"><img src="6936f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Schema Browsing with gq
</p></div></div><p>
The Used in objectclasses box in Figure 1 tells us
that the selected attribute, uid, appears in the object classes
uidObject, posixAccount, shadowAccount and inetOrgPerson,
all of which we identified earlier using <tt  >grep</tt>. The object class
OpenLDAPperson does <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> appear in the gq screen, because
the LDAP server in question doesn't have an include statement in its
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf file for the file openldap.schema. When
in doubt, you should include schema you're not sure
you need. After you settle on an LDAP record format, you can always
un-include schema that don't contain object classes you need.
</p><p>
All this probably sounds like a lot of trouble and indeed it can be,
but it's extremely important to be able to create records
that contain the kinds of information pertinent to your LDAP needs.
Because LDAP is so flexible, figuring out precisely how to assemble
that information in the form of attributes can take some tinkering.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x26ffd98"></a>
Building and Adding Records</h2></div></div><p>
Just as schema browsing can be done either manually or with a GUI, so can
adding LDAP records. We used the manual method last month to create our
root organization entry, and we'll do so again to add our first user
record. This method has two steps: first, create a special text file
in LDIF format, then use the ldapadd command to import it
into the LDAP database. Consider the LDIF file in Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x26ffea0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. LDIF File for a User Record</b></p><pre     class="screen">
dn: cn=Wong Fei Hung,dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org
cn: Wong Fei Hung
sn: Wong
givenname: Fei Hung
objectclass: person
objectclass: top
objectclass: inetOrgPerson
mail: wongfh@wiremonkeys.org
telephonenumber: 651-344-1043
o: Wiremonkeys
uid: wongfh
</pre></div><p>
Because they determine everything else, we'll begin by examining Listing
1's objectclass statements: this user has been associated with
the object classes top (mandatory for all records), person and
inetorgperson. I chose person because it supports the attributes
userPassword (which is <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> set in Listing 1; we'll set
Mr. Wong's password shortly) and telephonenumber, which I don't need
now but may in the future. The object class inetOrgPerson supports the uid attribute, plus a whole slew of others that
also may come in handy later.
</p><p>
One way around having to know and comply with the MUST and MAY
restrictions in schema is to add the statement <tt  >schemacheck
off</tt> to
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf. This allows you to use any attribute
defined in any schema file included in slapd.conf without needing
to pay any attention to object classes. However, it also adversely
affects your LDAP server's interoperability with other LDAP servers and
even with other applications (besides flouting LDAP RFCs), so many LDAP
experts consider it poor form to disable schema checking in this manner.
</p><p>
It isn't necessary to discuss each and every line in Listing 1; many of
the attributes are self-explanatory. In short, know that you don't need
to set every attribute you intend to use, but some are mandatory; they
are contained in MUST() statements in their respective object class
definitions. Each attribute you do define must be specified in the
MUST() or MAY() statement of at least one of the object classes
defined in the record, and some attributes, such as cn, may be
defined multiple times in the same record.
</p><p>
To add the record specified in Listing 1, use the ldapadd command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ldapadd -x \
-D "cn=ldapguy,dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org" \
-W -f ./wong.ldif
</pre>
</p><p>
This is similar to how we used ldapadd in last month's
column. For a complete explanation of this command's syntax, see the
ldapadd(1) man page.
</p><p>
If you specified the attributes required by all object classes set in
the LDIF file, if all attributes you specified are supported by
those object classes and if you provide the correct LDAP
bind password when prompted, the record is added to the database. If any of those
conditions is false, however, the action fails and ldapadd tells you what
went wrong. Thus, you can use trial and error to craft
a workable record format. After you've figured this out the first time,
you can use the same format for subsequent records, without going through
all this schema-induced zaniness.
</p><p>
I offer one caveat: say your LDIF file contains multiple records, which
is permitted, if your LDAP server detects an error,
it quits parsing the file and does not attempt to add any records
below the one that failed. Therefore, you should stick to single-record
LDIF files for the first couple of user adds, until you've finalized
your record format.
</p><p>
The manual record creation method is a little clunky, but it
accommodates a certain amount of tinkering. This is especially useful
in the early stages of LDAP database construction.
</p><p>
Once you have a user record or two in place, you can use a GUI tool
such as LDAP Browser/Editor (<a href="http://www.iit.edu/~gawojar/ldap" target="_self">www.iit.edu/~gawojar/ldap</a>) or gq
(included in most Linux distributions) to create additional records. In
gq, for example, left-clicking on a record pops up a menu containing
the option New&rarr;Use current entry, which copies the selected record
into a new record. This is much faster and simpler than typing
everything into an LDIF file manually.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x2700528"></a>
Creating Passwords</h2></div></div><p>
I mentioned in the description of Listing 1 that we generally don't
specify user passwords in LDIF files. A separate mechanism is used for
that, in the form of the command ldappasswd. By design, its syntax is
similar to that of ldapadd:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bind-$ ldappasswd -S -x -D
"cn=hostmaster,dc=upstreamsolutions,dc=com" \
-W "cn=Phil Lesh,dc=upstreamsolutions,dc=com"
</pre>
</p><p>
You don't need to be logged in to a shell session on the LDAP server to
use the ldappasswd command. You instead can use the -H option to specify
the URL of a remote LDAP server, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ldappasswd -S -x \
-H ldaps://ldap.upstreamsolutions.com \
-D "cn=hostmaster,dc=upstreamsolutions,dc=com" \
-W "cn=Phil Lesh,dc=upstreamsolutions,dc=com"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x2700790"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This option also may be used with ldapadd.
</p><p>
The ldaps:// URL is required in the above example. I've specified the
-x option for simple clear-text authentication, so I definitely need to
connect to the server with TLS encryption
rather than in the clear. Last month, I showed how to set up an LDAP
server to accept TLS connections.
</p><p>
Having said all that, however, I must point out that password management
for end users is one of LDAP's problem areas. On the one hand, if
your users all have access to the ldappasswd command,
you can use a combination of local /etc/ldap.conf files
and scripts/front ends for ldappasswd to make it reasonably simple for
users to change their own passwords.
</p><p>
But for users who run some other OS, you must
manage passwords centrally and have all
users contact the e-mail administrator every time
they need to change their password, or you must install LDAP
client software for their OS. For client systems
running Microsoft Windows, you can configure Samba
to let users change their LDAP password with the
Windows password tool. See the article &ldquo;OpenLDAP
Everywhere&rdquo; in <i  >LJ</i>, December 2002.

Access Controls</h2></div></div><p>
Technically, we've covered or touched on all the tasks needed to build an
LDAP server using OpenLDAP (excluding, necessarily, the sometimes lengthy
step of actually getting your various server applications to
authenticate users against it successfully). In the interests of robust security,
a concept not alien to readers of this column,
we need to discuss one more thing: OpenLDAP access control lists (ACLs).
</p><p>
As with most other things affecting the slapd d&aelig;mon, ACLs are set in
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf. And, like most other things involving
LDAP, ACLs can be confusing to say the least and usually require some
tinkering to get right. Listing 2 shows a sample set of ACLs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2607580.0x2700bb0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. ACLs in /etc/slapd.conf</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
access to attrs=userPassword
    by dn="cn=ldapguy,dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org" write
    by self write
    by * compare

access to *
    by dn="cn=ldapguy,dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org" write
    by users read
    by * auth

</pre></div><p>
ACLs are described in detail in the slapd.conf(5) man page, but in Listing
2 you can see generally how they work. For each LDAP element to which you
wish to control access, you specify who may access it and with what level
of access. Technically, an entire ACL can be listed on one line,
but by convention we list each
&ldquo;by...&rdquo; statement on its own line. slapd is smart enough to know that
the string &ldquo;access to&rdquo; marks the beginning of the next ACL.
</p><p>
Space doesn't permit my describing ACL syntax in detail, but
remember a few important points. First, ACLs are parsed from top to bottom,
and first match wins; they act like a stack of filters. Therefore,
it's crucial that you put specific ACLs and by statements
above more general ones. For example, in Listing 2 we see an ACL restricting access to the
userPassword attribute, followed by one applicable to *, that is, the
entire LDAP database. Putting the userPassword ACL first means
the rule that allows users to change their own passwords (access to
attrs=userPassword by self write) is an exception to the more general
rule stating users may read anything (access to * by users read).
</p><p>
Another important point is access levels are hierarchical. Possible
levels are none, auth, compare, search, read and write, where none is
the lowest level of access and write is the highest, and where each
level includes the rights of all levels lower than it. These two points,
the first match wins rule and the inclusive nature of access levels,
are crucial to understanding how ACLs are parsed. They also are important
for making sure
your ACLs don't lead to either greater or lesser levels of access
than you intend in a given situation.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
LDAP is one of the most complicated technologies I personally have worked
with lately. To make it work the way you need, you have to
spend a lot of time testing while watching logs and fine-tuning the
configurations of both the LDAP server and the applications you
wish to authenticate against it. But, having such a flexible, powerful
and widely supported authentication and directory mechanism is well worth
the trouble. I hope this series of articles has helped you get there
or at least pointed you in the right direction.
