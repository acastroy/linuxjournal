Linux Makes Wi-Fi Happen in New York City</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #113, September 2003</div></div><div><p>
Community groups, startup companies
and even the phone company are using Linux to make
New York City into one big happy wireless network
hot spot. How is your town doing?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131c580.0x1414240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Public wireless networks are hacker community
outreach. For hackers, it's a way to bring
broadband Internet to public spaces. For users in
streets and parks, it's a more civilized public
life. Unwired from providers, public Wi-Fi makes
the Net a gift&mdash;a civic grace akin to parks,
sidewalks, boulevards and libraries.
</p><p>
In May 2003, when the FCC continued deregulating
ownership of what we used to call the &ldquo;public&rdquo;
air waves, the agency made a big deal about &ldquo;saving&rdquo; what was
left of &ldquo;free over-the-air&rdquo;
broadcasting. The Internet, however, needs no
deregulation&mdash;or regulation&mdash;to make it
free over the air. All it needs is generous
technologists, citizens and civic organizations.
That's what we have in New York City today. And, their work is remarkable
to behold.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131c580.0x14144a8"></a>
New York Unwired</h2></div></div><p>
Some public Wi-Fi efforts are largely municipal. That's the case with
Long Beach, California,
which provides a large
public &ldquo;hot zone&rdquo; in its downtown and another at its airport.
Other efforts are driven by technically savvy volunteers,
such as in Austin, London, Perth, Seattle, San Francisco and
many other places. Companies also are doing their
part. In Asheville, North Carolina, Natural
Communications offers a public hot spot called the
BeamPost. New York, however, is different breed. It's all the above.
</p><p>
Although New York ranks 27th on Intel's list of &ldquo;most
unwired&rdquo; cities (Portland is first), it is perhaps the
best example of a working consensus between hackers,
businesses, government and nonprofits about
the need for free public Wi-Fi. This consensus is
what gave rise to NYCwireless, a self-described
&ldquo;loose collection of interested minds&rdquo;. NYCwireless
has two missions: to provide free public wireless
Internet access and to provide a forum for
wireless technology development.
</p><p>
The founders of NYCwireless are Anthony Townsend
and Terry Schmidt, partners in Emenity, the company
that has been building out the new NYCwireless
infrastructure in New York. Both NYCwireless
and Emenity are products of public and private
symbiosis&mdash;same with its customers, which include
publicly funded neighborhood associations created
for the purpose, among other things, of building
out infrastructural improvements, such as public
Wi-Fi in the parks.
</p><p>
In May, New York's City Council issued a staff
report that recommends a restructuring of the
city's fractured broadband procurement methods,
a new fiber/wireless metropolitan area network
(MAN) and public Wi-Fi networks. As an example
of the latter, it says a potential Prospect Park
Wi-Fi network would cost $192,000 to create
but little to maintain. That report opens with special thanks to Anthony
Townsend, who is also a Research Scientist at
NYU's Taub Urban Research Center, where he has
produced a pile of wise and seminal papers about
the growth of the Internet in urban settings.
Terry Schmidt's job is turning Anthony's vision
into reality. Terry is Emenity's CTO and the hacker
behind Pebble Linux, the stripped-down Debian used
in NYCwireless access points.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131c580.0x14147c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Pebble Linux: Debian for Wi-Fi</b></p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6897s1f1.large.jpg"><img src="6897s1f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
An Inexpensive Single-Board Computer from Soekris Engineering
</p></div></div><p>
If you want to set up a
public access point (AP), however, you'll need something that gives you a
high level of functionality and control, in a compact and reliable
system. Something, of course, that runs on a form of Linux.
Pebble Linux is a tiny Debian-based Linux that's
the basis of a load-and-go, fully-featured,
(relatively) easy-to-customize, no-moving-parts
AP. Created by Terry Schmidt of NYCwireless and
maintained by a pack of user/hackers, Pebble is
Debian, stripped down to a size and shape that
fits cozily on a 128MB Flash card. Because
it's Debian, adding and removing packages is
relatively easy. Here's how Terry Schmidt says he did it:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
I stripped out all the documentation, all the Perl stuff, a lot of
the binaries, all the packages I didn't think were necessary.
I got it down to 44MB. I wanted the functionality of a real distro like Debian in a size that
would fit in a CompactFlash in something like a Soekris box. I could
do <tt  >apt-get install apache</tt> and bang, we'd have
Apache. So the full package manager is there, with all the ease and
functionality you'd expect.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Terry's README (<a href="http://www.nycwireless.net/pebble/pebble.README" target="_self">www.nycwireless.net/pebble/pebble.README</a>) file adds:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Its biggest advantage is that it mounts read-only. You don't have
to worry as much about wearing down the CompactFlash, and you don't
have to worry about doing proper shutdowns. Unplug and plug in as
much as you want.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
There are two packages in a base Pebble image that aren't installed as
Debian packages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
HostAP: a driver for Prism-based 802.11 cards that provides the best
support for running an AP, as opposed to a client. This is
available as a Debian package, but Pebble uses the latest version
from CVS, because it associates better with 802.11g clients.
</p></li><li><p>
NoCatAuth: more details below.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Three optional packages also are available:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
&ldquo;Pebble mesh&rdquo; support, which allows multiple Pebble machines to
form a transparent mesh. This means that a user can roam without
changing IP addresses or losing network connectivity. AP mesh
capability (which is, IMNSHO, unbelievably cool) is the most
interesting add-on for people building <span   class="emphasis"><em>public</em></span> wireless networks.
You can build an arbitrarily large wireless hot zone,
and&mdash;best of all&mdash;the devices autoconfigure, so adding or removing a
node doesn't require modifying the configurations of the other nodes.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for an ELAN SC520 watchdog timer. In particular, this
addresses the built-in watchdog timer on the Soekris. This allows
for automatic reboot in case of software glitches. It's
particularly useful when the AP is mounted someplace that's hard
to access (like in a kiosk in a public park), or the AP isn't
actively monitored (like almost every AP). This, along with
the read-only filesystem, makes a Pebble system close to
zero-maintenance.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for running as a bridging firewall.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Pebble runs well on a 486 processor or better and requires no more
than 32MB of RAM and 128MB of &ldquo;disk&rdquo; storage. It probably will run on
that old 486 in your closet, but for less than $300, you can buy the
very cool and very tiny Soekris 4511-20
and a wireless card&mdash;and be up and running
in no time. If you're hard-core, you can buy the Soekris with no power
supply or case and build your AP for less than $250.
</p><p>
Pebble is designed to work out of the box with any Intersil Prism2 or
Prism2.5-based 802.11b card, such as the Linksys WPC11, the D-Link
DWL-650 or the Compaq WL100 and WL200. With some simple configuration,
it should work with any Linux-supported 802.11b card.
</p><p>
When you're ready to get started with Pebble, see the project site.
As an alternative to Pebble for the /truly/ minimal-minded, you might
consider WISP-Dist (Wireless ISP
Distribution&mdash;<a href="http://leaf.sourceforge.net" target="_self">leaf.sourceforge.net</a>). WISP is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>incredibly</em></span>
tiny; it fits on an 8MB Flash ROM and 16MB of RAM. It's not nearly
as full-featured as Pebble (it's a really-vanilla AP) nor is it as easy
to customize.
</p><p>
To set up your own public AP, all you need is an ISP that doesn't care if
you share bandwidth, an AP, a target service area, a directional antenna
and motivation.
</p><p>
Some ISPs, like Bway.net
in New York, are happy
to let you share the bandwidth for which you pay. Others, like Time-Warner
Cable and AT&amp;T Broadband, crack down
on users sharing bandwidth.
A local
public Wi-Fi organization can help you locate an ISP with
suitable terms of service or help you lobby your ISP to change their
terms of service. Freenetworks.org can
help you find your nearest public Wi-Fi group.
</p><p>
NYCwireless' mission is to target outdoor
public spaces, such as parks. Placement means
everything. As Doc and Britt discovered when
trying to reach Tudor City's park from high
in a building half a block away, distance is
a problem. A highly directional antenna can
help by concentrating energy in a narrow beam,
but a nearby omnidirectional (omni) antenna
outperforms a distant directional antenna nearly
every time. Bryant Park is served from a number
of points by a combination of omni and sector
(directional) antennas on the tops of kiosk
buildings. City Hall Park is much better served
by a sector antenna on the store across the
street. Verizon gets great curbside service from
simple omni antennas on public phone booths.
</p><p>
Antennas are not commodities, but they don't have to be expensive,
either. And, sometimes simply putting an AP in a window does the job.
Ben Hammersly did exactlly that for Kynance Mews in London and served a
whole street, including two outdoor cafes. Motivation, of course, is up to you.

Going Signal Fishing</h2></div></div><p>
Wi-Fi range is low on purpose. It operates on a
tiny wedge of unlicensed microwave frequencies divided into
14 channels between 2.412 and 2.484GHz. Here
in the US, we use only 1&ndash;11. In Europe they use
1&ndash;13, except for France, where they use 10&ndash;13. Japan
runs from 1&ndash;14. The default transmission power
of most access points (also known as APs, WAPs
and base stations) is 30mw, about one-tenth the power
of a cell phone but on a higher frequency, where
the energy attenuates more rapidly with distance
through air and has trouble penetrating many
objects, including tinted windows and leaves full
of microwave-absorbing water.
</p><p>
Wi-Fi range tends to run less than the average cordless phone, which
sports a more powerful signal.
With such a handy service delivered by such a short-range signal, it's
only natural to find the best signal where the population is
both dense and conveniently arranged, such as New York City, where
people live and work on top of one another.
</p><p>
I ran six wardriving sessions, which included
nine taxi rides, nearly all in Manhattan. The last
session ended with a highway ride to LaGuardia
Airport through signal-free parts of Queens. Each
session recorded basic data about every detected
signal, including ESSID (Extended Service Set
Identifier&mdash;the access point's name).
On the nine rides, I logged a total of
1,548 open access points.
</p><p>
On city streets in Manhattan, I found there was
nearly always an access point in range. And I'm
sure the numbers above would have been much higher
if I'd had an antenna outside each taxi instead
of on my lap in the back seat. Although
lots of commercial hot spots exist, the vast majority
appear to belong to individuals. &ldquo;Linksys&rdquo;
is the default ESSID for the company's popular
inexpensive access points.
</p><p>
The willingness of individuals to share bandwidth
is amazing. Although the number of wide-open APs
was lower than the WEP numbers above suggest,
because quite a few were password-protected,
plenty of usable signals still were available. More than
once I was able to pick up and send e-mail while
a cab was stopped at a light.
</p><p>
The ideal way to go signal fishing with a Linux
or BSD laptop is with Kismet, a wireless network
sniffer so full-featured it even does neat stuff
with GPS, precisely associating signals with
locations [see page XX].

Right before the trip, I mentioned in a SuitWatch
newsletter that I'd be coming to New York to check
out the Wi-Fi situation and that I could use
some local help. The first reply came from Kurt
Starsinic who quickly became my Wi-Fi docent for
warwalking and wardriving through lower Manhattan.
I hooked up with Kurt at Alt.Coffee on Avenue A
across from Tompkins Square Park. Alt.Coffee is
both a comfortably run-down coffee house and a
reliquary for dead computers. Kaypros, ARCnet
hubs, early-vintage PCs and other antiques are
scattered on tables and piled up in corners&mdash;worth a visit.
</p><p>
As it happened, the APs for both Alt.Coffee
and NYCwireless were down while we were there,
but when we walked around Tompkins Square Park,
we still found at least one home node with an
open and usable connection. And yes, <span   class="emphasis"><em>of course</em></span>
we used it.
</p><p>
Our next stop was City Hall Park where the
NYCwireless signal is clear and strong. There I
was able to sample NYCwireless' local fare while
Kurt briefed me on technology issues and both of us
waited for my old friend Stephen Lewis to show up.
</p><p>
Steve, who carries US and Dutch passports, is
a European telco industry veteran who was highly
curious about what was happening with Wi-Fi in his
home town. Walking around Steve's old haunts in the
Lower East Side, we were impressed by the density
of Wi-Fi, from both public and private sources:
Verizon public phones, McDonalds restaurants and
Starbucks coffee shops, in addition to private
homes.
</p><p>
The ability to get on the Web almost anywhere in an outdoor urban
setting was especially impressive to Steve, a two-time Fulbright Scholar
with a hearty appetite for information. As a result, he began to develop
ambitious plans to carry the lessons of New York neighborhood Wi-Fi
(including Linux technologies) to Bulgaria, where he has lived for much
of the last decade.
</p><p>
One of the most interesting figures in the New York Wi-Fi movement is
Drazen Pantic. A former
mathematics professor at the University of Belgrade, Drazen ran the
Internet service of B92, a radio station that was
a thorn in the side of the Milosevic regime. After the station's
transmitter was shut down mysteriously, Drazen made sure
the station's
news and information continued to come out on the station's Web site
and through streams that were picked up and rebroadcast in the UK,
Netherlands, the US, and, most significantly, Yugoslavia. Stations
there picked up and rebroadcast the analog signals relayed by satellite
from the Netherlands. As a result, B92 quickly became the primary source
of news from, and about, Yugoslavia and the conflicts there. Hearing him
tell the story of his life, it was clear that Drazen was a hero of
several revolutions at once.
</p><p>
Drazen is also involved with
Dyne.org, a Vienna-based group of free software
hackers devoted to producing GPL'd freeware for real-time video
processing, media streaming and other cool stuff. The coolest of Dyne's
tools, Drazen explained, is HasciiCam, a neat
little hack that captures video from a TV card, renders it into ASCII
and outputs it in a variety of ways&mdash;as HTML with a refresh tag, as a
live ASCII window or as a simple text file.
</p><p>
On the downstream side, Drazen is excited about both the Dyne:bolic
Linux distro and MPEG4IP.
Dyne:bolic is a multimedia-oriented
distro that can run from a CD and recognize sound, video, TV, network
cards and other peripherals. MPEG4IP is a streaming package that
obviates the need to use proprietary streaming systems.
Drazen says, &ldquo;After downloading Dynebolic, you can burn a CD,
boot in to Linux and stream high quality MPEG4.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Drazen believes all these open-source efforts will finish liberating
audio and video authoring, production and distribution from the
corporate chokeholders that still hold our ambitions and imaginations in
check. He sees Linux as the public OS platform and Wi-Fi as the public
network commons. Together they'll support a new form of (literally)
public TV and radio. Between Wi-Fi, HasciiCam, digital camcorders, cheap
hardware, free software, Dyne:bolic and MPEG4IP, Drazen expects the
threshold of reporting and broadcasting to drop about as far as it can
go. When it gets there, watch out.

Luggables and Wearables</h2></div></div><p>
On Sunday I returned to Alt.Coffee to meet with Ahmi Wolf.
He and Mark Argo are the creators of the Bass-Station,
a turn-of-the-80s suitcase-size ghetto
blaster
that also happens to be a digital juke box and a Wi-Fi hot spot. Ahmi
and Mark removed the radio and cassette components of this funky old
thing and replaced them with a variety of modern portable Wi-Fi goods:
Via mini-ITX motherboard, wireless interface card hooked to an
antenna, Debian (Woody) loaded onto a CompactFlash card, and a 120GB
hard drive. They left the amplifier and speakers and hooked them up to
the board's audio output.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131c580.0x180e7a0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Boom-Box: the Guts behind the Glory</b></p><p>
The Bass-Station's guts consist of a mini-ITX motherboard using an
800MHz processor (<a href="http://www.viatech.com" target="_self">www.viatech.com</a>), 256MB of RAM, a
Prism-based PCI
wireless interface card and a 120GB IDE hard drive. It runs Debian
Linux (Woody 3.01), which uses the HostAP drivers (hostap.epitest.fi) to
put the Wi-Fi card into an access-point mode so the machine appears as a
managed node as opposed to an ad hoc
client mode. We have a DHCP server for dishing out IP addresses to wireless clients.
It is the standard ISC DHCP server that comes with almost all Linux
distros, configured in the standard manner. The Bass-Station also runs a DNS server configured to serve as the
top-most authoritative DNS server on the Net&mdash;the so-called
dot (.) domain, which resolves all domains to the IP address of the
Bass-Station. This way any URL a user points to
takes that user to the Bass-Station's
Web server.
</p><p>
There also are alternative ways to take users to a specific Web page.
Using active portal software like NoCat (<a href="http://www.nocat.net" target="_self">www.nocat.net</a>) will do this,
but the purpose of such software is to be a portal or entryway to a
network. The problem with this software is that it tries to resolve the
intended URL <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> it shows you the portal page.
Because the
Bass-Station is not connected to or associated with any other network,
there is no means to resolve an external intended address, so the
program tries to resolve and resolve and doesn't show anything.
So here's the hack-around. Start with a clean installation of the DNS
system Bind (we used version 9). Then, in /etc/bind/named.conf change the zone &ldquo;.&rdquo; entry to the following:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

zone "." {
type master;
file "/etc/bind/db.root";
notify no;
};

</pre><p>
Then, replace the default db,root file (back it up first) with a file
that contains only the following:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

;-----------Beginning of file------------;
$TTL 604800
@ IN SOA . root.localhost. (
1 ; Serial
604800 ; Refresh
86400 ; Retry
2419200 ; Expire
604800 ) ; Negative Cache TTL
@ IN NS .
* IN A 192.168.23.1
;-----------End of File----------------;

</pre><p>
Replace the IP address 192.168.23.1 with the IP address to which you
want all domains to be resolved.
</p><p>
Data lives in a MySQL database and is displayed through the Apache Web
server. Together these provide the interface to all functionalities. For
now these include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Uploading files (we're using HTTP, so all
interaction can happen through a browser).
</p></li><li><p>
Browsing/viewing/downloading of files located on the Bass-Station.
</p></li><li><p>
Controlling the playback of music from the stereo.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
We use mpg123 for media file playback. I also wrote the back-end program
for control of mpg123 and interaction with our databases. C++ source
should be available on our site some time in the future.
</p><p>
&mdash;Ahmi Wolf
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x131c580.0x180f038"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The result is the social and aesthetic opposite of an iPod: a big ugly
stereo that's also a Linux-based Wi-Fi access point, plus a juke box
with a big-ass hard drive. The idea was to create a juke box for all kinds of convivial
settings&mdash;from parties in parks to hang-outs on college campuses.
Everyone connected by Wi-Fi to the Bass-Station gets to contribute music and play
disk jockey, so it rewards cooperation as well.
</p><p>
The Bass-Station belongs to the
neighborhood extranet&mdash;not to an individual and not to the whole
world. Ahmi explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The Bass-Station is not connected to or a part of another network.
It creates it's own network that exists only within the range of the
Bass-Station itself. On one hand, the range of Wi-Fi is limited, but
the limited range makes it special. Users of the network are all in
close proximity to each other, making them members of a
community&mdash;be it a stable, persistent community or a spontaneous
and mobile one like the Bass-Station's network.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Ahmi's Bulgarian friend Milena
Iossifova,
a fellow student at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program,
has a way-cool Wi-Fi creation of her own called Wi-Fisense,
which she calls &ldquo;a wearable scanner for
wireless networks&rdquo;. It's a handbag with 64 LEDs in
three different colors, each turned on by Wi-Fi activity on a different
channel.
</p><p>
The optimism and energy of all this reminded me of what Silicon
Valley felt like back in the 80s and 90s but without the corrupting
context of other people's money. Ahmi, Milena and Dave
already have produced enabling goods in this new culture.

Building a New Infrastructure, One Pebble at a Time</h2></div></div><p>
I met with Terry Schmidt at Emenity's offices near Wall Street, where he
briefed me on the challenges of deploying public Wi-Fi in New York's
peculiar urban settings. The first big project for both NYCwireless and Emenity was Bryant Park,
which shares a midtown block with the New York's Public Library. Terry
explains:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
We overbuilt that one with two omni antennas, one sector antenna and
two point-to-point links within the park itself. But it was a big
success, so it became clear that there was a need for free wireless
networks. A volunteer organization like NYCwireless can't easily do
service level agreements and stuff like that, so that's what we provide
with Emenity.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Terry sees Emenity as a midway organization between the purely voluntary
and the purely self-reliant. Bryant Park, for example, originally was
built by NYCwireless, then maintained by Emenity and now is
run entirely in-house by the park itself.
</p><p>
Emenity's biggest customer is the Downtown Alliance, a business
improvement district (BID)
organized to &ldquo;create and promote a safe, clean, live-work, totally wired
community&rdquo;. BIDs throughout the city
are supported by a small additional local sales tax. Improvements to
Bryant Park&mdash;which are nothing less than spectacular, considering the
no-mans-land it used to be&mdash;are examples of a BID at work. Because the
alliance serves landowners, it also can approach them with requests to
use their roofs or windows for wireless antennas aimed down at public
spaces.

A Rooftop Antenna Serves City Hall Park

Location, Location, Location</h2></div></div><p>
At City Hall Park, the rooftop across the street
at J&amp;R Music and Computer World proved to be the
ideal access point location. A square white sector
antenna with a beam width of about 40&deg;,
angles down at the park and provides a signal
footprint that serves the park itself and little
else. At the far edge of the park by City Hall
it fades away. A fairly precise footprint also
graciously yields to other access points at the
local Starbucks, City Hall, the Woolworth Building
and elsewhere in the neighborhood.
</p><p>
Terry Schmidt says NYCwireless encourages local citizens operating free
access points to label them &ldquo;NYCwireless&rdquo; and register with NYCwireless
so they appear on the organization's node list.
End user licensing runs the gamut from locked-down to free. Time-Warner,
for example, aggressively denies users the right to share bandwidth. At
the other extreme, Verizon sells Wi-Fi access points to its DSL
customers.

Verizon Gets It</h2></div></div><p>
Verizon, which has thousands of phone booths on the streets of New York,
has seen the same writing on the own wall, and come up with a
brilliant plan: turn phone booths
into access points. The first 150 were fired up on May 13, and the
company has plans to add the service to 500 or more throughout the city
and beyond.
</p><p>
At the time of this writing, the service is available and free, to Verizon
business and residential DSL customers only. But there's nothing in the
deployment that prevents the company from opening up to other customers
or from opening up completely&mdash;it was designed that way. In fact, it was designed to be
as easily deployable and modifiable as possible, which is why the
company made use of Linux and open-source tools. Sean Byrnes, an
architect with Verizon, explained it this way:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
What Linux let us do was deploy extremely quickly. So, rather than
setting up large servers in one of our data centers, we were able to
create Linux clusters and build initial versions that supported the
hot spot service extremely quickly, using a wide variety of open-source software&mdash;much more quickly than if we had been waiting for
licenses, etc. We couldn't have moved it into the data center if Linux didn't allow
us to develop with platform independence and with open-source
technologies that are implemented across multiple operating systems.
We're working to have Linux qualified for the data centers, but it
isn't there yet.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
When I said it sounded to me like Verizon was an example of a company
that found it easier to roll their own solutions than depend on
vendors for help, Sean Byrnes replied, &ldquo;That would be an understatement,
actually.&rdquo; He explained:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
If you think of very large companies, more often than not, when
you're rolling out a new service or application, the argument can be
made that the majority of it is glue. Because you already have so
many systems and applications out there you have to
glue them together somehow, so you're forced to be agile. It's never
a question of being able to buy a package from a vendor and use it
on day one.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
With that many managed access points on the street, the Verizon people
have been gaining some valuable experience with Wi-Fi in the real world.
Terry Schmidt isn't optimistic about nonfree business models for Wi-Fi.
He says, &ldquo;We don't think that a lot of the for-pay wireless stuff has a
sustainable business model. Companies like T-Mobile, with all those
Starbucks locations, are hemorraging money, and almost nobody's using
them.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Meanwhile, plenty of people are taking advantage of free Wi-Fi in
places like Bryant Park and Alt.Coffee. &ldquo;Free wireless is good for business&rdquo;, Terry says.
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
That's the model. Local business owner says, &ldquo;I'm going to make my business and my
surrounding market more valuable by providing free wireless. It's an
attractive thing to do. It enhances the environment and attracts
customers.&rdquo;
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Does Verizon's service, free for existing customers, serve as a
conditional flower box? I believe so. Verizon is the incumbent local
phone company in New York. It has a lot of home and business DSL
customers. Flower boxes that appear magically for those customers are
a nice bonus to existing service. It's a way for Verizon to say &ldquo;Take
that laptop out of here. Go sit in a cafe somewhere&rdquo;.

Enlarging Civic Life</h2></div></div><p>
Wi-Fi adds a new and practical feature to civic life. For two decades,
most personal computing happened indoors, attached to printers,
networks, servers and phone lines. If we used our laptops outdoors, it
was usually in the same disconnected way we still use them on airplanes.
With public Wi-Fi, we bring the networked knowledge of the world out
into the open air, and that changes things.
</p><p>
For all the years I used to visit the New York Public Library, I
completely ignored the wasteland that was Bryant Park. This last trip
was my first exposure to Bryant Park, because it was completely re-done in
the fashion of the great parks of Europe's cultural capitals. With its
lawns, fountains, shaded pavilions and chairs scattered on sidewalks
outside restaurants with open doors, it seemed to me the height of
civilization.
It also made me love civilization and
the graces that increase it. That's saying a lot, too.
It is the public places that civilize our cities. Perhaps public Wi-Fi
will civilize the Net as well.
