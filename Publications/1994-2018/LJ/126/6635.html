Tools are available that allow you to do professional photographic
work straight from your Linux desktop.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1853580.0x194b298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
A new breed of inexpensive, photo-quality
products are revolutionizing the photo industry, and Linux is there
with the tools to put these products to use. In 1990, while editing my
first digital image on a Mac SE, I had visions of one day having all
the power of a high-end photo retouching workstation in my own digital
studio. Several years later, I had the Mac studio I had dreamed of
but still was dependent on an outside service bureau for scanning and
printing. Around 1996, I saw an early version of The GIMP and was excited
at the possibility of moving my digital studio to Linux. Fast-forward to
the present: inexpensive photo scanners and printers are available that
offer professional results at affordable prices, and the Linux drivers
and tools are there to take advantage. A color management work flow is
starting to take shape on Linux, and The GIMP is maturing at a steady pace.
</p><p>
I now can go from scanned transparency through digital retouching
to final output, all in my own studio running Linux. This article
explains the steps required for creating professional digital prints with
Linux by following one of my images through the process. Rather than go
into details about compiling and installing Linux packages, I try
to give a bird's-eye view of how the different pieces fit together
and provide links to more detailed information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1853580.0x194b3f8"></a>
Hardware Requirements</h2></div></div><p>
Not much separates the workstation I use for
photo editing from a good Linux desktop. Certainly, the more memory
you have the better; I recommend 512MB as a minimum, and a fast
disk is a real time-saver as well. My photo workstation is a dual-head,
1.7GHz P4 machine with 1GB of RAM and three 36GB, 10K RPM SCSI hard drives. What
truly separates a photo editing setup from a generic desktop are the
peripherals. Excellent photo-quality scanners and printers are now
available for under $1,000 US. Most of these are supported under
Linux, but always check the Linux compatibility pages before you buy one
of these specialized devices. When looking for a scanner, cross-check
advice from dedicated on-line photo forums, such as <a href="http://Photo.net" target="_self">Photo.net</a>, with the
Linux compatibility information found on the VueScan and SANE Web sites.
Because I shoot large format, 4" &times; 5" film, my choice in desktop scanners
is limited to flatbed scanners with transparency adapters. For 35mm
film scanning, the dedicated film scanners offer better results than
flatbeds. For photo printers, it's hard to beat the current generation
of Epson inkjets. The <a href="http://LinuxPrinting.org" target="_self">LinuxPrinting.org</a> site provides a great
utility to find out whether a particular printer is supported under Linux,
and it even suggests the best driver to use.

Color Communication</h2></div></div><p>
Communication is all about having a standard vocabulary that
two parties understand, and in the world of color communication the
International Color Consortium (ICC) provides this lingua
franca. All
color devices have their own color space, meaning they are able to
reproduce only a certain range of colors. This type of color is known as
device-dependent color. In order to convert between different color
spaces, a device-independent color space is needed. ICC uses a color
description known as the CIE 1931 standard colorimetric observer to
describe accurately the color space of any color device. ICC profiles
are files that contain the information needed to translate the color
space of a particular device to this device-independent color space. A
special type of color space, called the working color space, is a
device-independent color space used when editing an image. By having one
common language and a translator from each different language, complete
communication is possible. Although it's helpful to know all about
color theory, it is not required to make good color prints. All
you do need to know is that ICC profiles are used to convert
the colors from one device to the colors of another device accurately.

Monitor Calibration</h2></div></div><p>
An accurate monitor is vital for working with color photos.
Professionals use a device called a colorimeter to measure the actual
computer display and create an ICC profile that then is used by the
OS to reproduce colors faithfully. Unfortunately,
I am aware of no Linux drivers that support any of these devices. Even if you
could get a monitor profile, The GIMP does not support using one for monitor
display. Certainly, this is one feature in The GIMP I sorely miss. In
fact, The GIMP bug #78265 documents the problem; hopefully, we will have this feature
soon. In the meantime, we will do the best we can by carefully adjusting
the monitor manually, using the controls built in to most quality monitors:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Set the monitor white point to 6,500K. This provides more yellow than
the 9,300K that most monitors ship with, but it is much easier for your
eyes to see correct color, which is why it's the industry standard
recommendation.
</p></li><li><p>
Increase the monitor contrast to 100% and adjust the brightness
until you can see most of the B Black Level strip in Norman Koren's
excellent calibration chart, shown in Figure 3.
</p></li><li><p>
Adjust the display gamma using the gamma strip of Figure 3. To
read the chart, squint your eyes until you can't discern the
horizontal lines and find the location where the gray tone is the same
across the strip; this is your current gamma. Adjust the display gamma
using xgamma until the gamma is 2.2, the industry default.
</p></li><li><p>
Now adjust the separate R, G and B controls to make the gray
of the target as neutral as possible. Use an image such as the color
calibration chart, shown in Figure 3, to help adjust the monitor
color balance. By focusing on the skin tones as well as neutral gray
tones, you should be able to eliminate any gross color imbalances.
</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6635f3.large.jpg"><img src="6635f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Koren's monitor gamma chart, and on the right, the Photodisc color
calibration image. These printed examples should not be used
for reference as their colors may have changed due to printing press
inconsistencies.
</p></div></div><p>
In addition to a well-adjusted monitor, a consistent lighting
environment is critical for accurate color viewing. Dim light is best,
and by lighting your room with 5,000K daylight-balanced compact
fluorescents,
the white of a piece of paper should look very close to the white on your
display. ISO 12646 goes into great depth on providing further guidelines
on ambient viewing conditions. Bright colors in your environment
alter your color perception, so watch out for brightly colored nearby
walls, as well as bright backgrounds and colored windows in your Linux
environment. My Linux desktop uses a plain gray background and black
and white window decorations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1853580.0x194c0b0"></a>
Scanner Calibration</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have a reasonably correct monitor and viewing environment,
we can turn our focus to scanning. Both SANE and VueScan are excellent
Linux solutions for scanning, I have chosen to use VueScan primarily
because it's the same software I use on the Mac. Whichever scanning
software you choose, it's important always to use the same
software settings. This is vital for correct color, as the ICC profile we
are about to create is valid only for the color settings used when making
it. In order to make a scanner profile, it's necessary to have a
known quantity to scan, called a color calibration target. The target
I use is the Q-60 Color Input Target made by Kodak, and it is available
from many high-end photo stores. Scan the target using your preferred
scanning software; remember to save your settings, and always use the
same settings moving forward.
</p><p>
Creating an ICC from this scan is made possible by the LProf profiling tools,
available from the Little CMS Web site (see on-line Resources). Run kmeasurementool and
open the scan. Go to the Options tab and select the correct pick
template for the target used, in this case the Kodak column picker. Go
back to the image tab and resize the green target outline. Once the
little squares are lined up with the color patches in the scan, select
Pick and then Save IT8 sheet. Now use kscannerprofiler to create a custom ICC
profile for your scanner by first selecting the correct target vendor
and
batch ID. Each target comes with a date identifying the batch. Open
the IT8 sheet file created above and enter an output profile filename
for your ICC profile, then press GO. This ICC profile now can be used to
interpret the color space of the scanner.

</p></div></div><p>
Now that we have profiled our scanner, we can scan an actual
transparency. When scanning, it's helpful to know the true optical
resolution of the scanner. Scanning at the maximum optical resolution
captures as much detail as possible without making your file too
large. When saving the file, use the TIFF format for best results as it
is a lossless format.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6635f5.large.jpg"><img src="6635f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Making the Initial Scan Using VueScan
</p></div></div><p>
After scanning the transparency, the resulting TIFF file's
color space is that of the scanner. I want to convert this color space
to a working color space to do my image editing. A popular working color
space is the Adobe 1998, a profile of which can be obtained
from the Adobe Web site. Apply the scanner profile using tifficc, which
is part of the Little CMS package, by running <tt  >tifficc -i scanner.icc -o
Adobe1998.icc scan.tiff scan_working.tiff</tt>, which converts the scanned
TIFF image to our working color space.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1853580.0x194c688"></a>
Photographic Tools in The GIMP</h2></div></div><p>
A lot of the tools in The GIMP, as well as other image editing
programs, aren't needed for photographic work. Most of my time is
spent using the Levels or Curves tools. The first adjustment I make is
to the overall exposure, and the best tool for this is Levels. Never
use the Brightness/Contrast tool, as it tends to clip values. Open the
Levels tool and slide the black and white points right up to the point
where data (height) is apparent. Adjust the middle slider to lighten or
darken the overall image.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6635f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Cleaning up dust and scratches is the vital next step, and the Clone tool
is perfect for this. Zoom in until the size of a dust spot
is easily seen on the screen and then carefully scan the entire image.
When you find a spot, select the Clone tool using a soft-edged brush
that is slightly larger than the dust spot. Set the Clone Tool Options
to 100% opacity and select aligned. Ctrl-click on an adjacent area to
pick up an area to copy, release the Ctrl key and click directly on top
of the spot. By using an opaque brush, the spot should be
removed completely. The technique for removing scratches is similar, but you have to watch
out for repeating patterns. With a little practice, you should be able
to clone large sections without any telltale artifacts.

The Artist's Proof</h2></div></div><p>
We now are ready to make a print. For me, the print is the final
piece of art, and I spend a lot of time trying to create a print that really
speaks to the viewer. I often will print out a picture 10&ndash;20
times, subtly making adjustments until I am happy with the image. I call this
inkjet print my artist proof.
</p><p>
To prepare the image for printing, a few adjustments must be made
that are specific to the print size. These adjustments are destructive,
so save a copy of your image to a master file before getting started.
First, resize the image by opening up the Scale Image dialog under
The GIMP's Image menu. For inkjets I recommend 200PPI at your desired
print size. Next, sharpen the image using the Unsharp
Mask tool. Think of this as enhancing the edges in a photo. In case
you're wondering why it's called unsharp, the name comes from
the traditional photographic method of using a blurred (or unsharp) copy
negative to increase the edge definition, and thus the perceived sharpness, of
an image. Select
Filter&rarr;Enhance&rarr;Unsharp Mask, and a dialog box appears
with three sliders. Radius is how far away from the edge pixels are
affected, Amount controls how much the pixels are changed and Threshold
determines which edges are affected. To decide how much sharpening
to apply, view the image at 100% and try a few settings. Unfortunately,
Unsharp Mask does not yet have a preview, so you have to apply a
setting, undo and repeat until you get the look you want. I
am looking for the setting where the sharpening is barely obvious on my
screen, generally starting with a radius of 1.0, a threshold of 3 and
an amount of .75.
</p><p>
I use CUPS with Gimp-Print when printing to the Epson inkjets. Check the
Gimp-Print Web page for instructions on getting this set up and running. By
using Gimp-Print, all of the Epson-specific options are available in the
Print menu. It also includes the Epson printer utility escputil,
which allows for head cleaning and print alignment. Ideally, at this
point we would be able to create an ICC profile for our printer;
however,
no software for Linux exists yet that does this. Instead, I recommend
creating a standard set of adjustments using Gimp-Print's color
adjust feature. To arrive at these adjustments, use a color test image
such as the one we used for monitor calibration. Print the image, and
look carefully at the results. You should be able to see details in the
shadows and separation in the grayscale step tablet; the neutral and
skin tones should not have a color bias. If this isn't the case, open the Print dialog
box, select Image/Output Settings&rarr;Adjust Output and make the necessary
changes. Repeat until your printout looks correct. Once you find a
standard set of adjustments, write them down so you can use them as a
starting point for future prints.

</p></div></div><p>
The moment of truth has finally arrived&mdash;will the final print match
what we have been viewing on the screen? Print out the image and compare
it to the image onscreen. They should be very similar, but
something is fundamentally different about looking at a print vs. the
screen. Study the image and see where improvements can be made, and
continue making refinements in The GIMP until you are satisfied.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1853580.0x1943808"></a>
Working with a Service Bureau</h2></div></div><p>
For salable, fine-art prints, I prefer Lightjet prints
made by a service bureau on a Cymbolic Sciences Lightjet printer. This
printer uses lasers to expose the image onto conventional photo paper,
most often Fuji Crystal Archive paper. Wilhelm Imaging Research tests (the
authority on photo print life) show these prints have a display life
of 60 years with little color shift or fading, significantly longer than
most inkjet prints. These prints are indistinguishable from conventional
photos and can be made as large as 4 &times; 5 feet.
</p><p>
Preparing the file for output on the Lightjet is similar to preparing
it for inkjet printing. Start by going back to the original file that was saved,
not the file for inkjet output. Again, resize the file to the correct
physical dimensions, this time using 300PPI rather than 200PPI, sharpen
the file using the technique described above and save it to a separate TIFF
file. The service bureau I use, Calypso Imaging, offers Lightjet prints
for photographers across the US. They also offer a discount if the file to
be output has been resized and the correct ICC profile, available from
their Web site, applied. Download the latest ICC profile and apply it to your
image using tifficc. The image then is ready to be burned to CD-ROM or
uploaded to Calypso's FTP site for final output.
</p><p>
A few days later I receive the final print, look back at the process used
to create it and contemplate how, although my photo tools have changed,
the goal remains the same&mdash;to create a print that conveys my feelings
about my chosen subject. Finally, I am able to go through this entire
process using Linux in combination with affordable desktop products, all
in my own digital studio. Although a few areas still need
improvements, Linux is very much up to the task. So get
out there, take some photos and try out these Linux tools to make great
photographic prints.
