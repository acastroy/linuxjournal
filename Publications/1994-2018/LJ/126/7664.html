<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #126, October 2004</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>Wichert Akkerman</b></span> has been trying for some time
to add a <span   class="bold"><b>Debian package</b></span> build target to the kernel
sources to complement the RPM target. His initial
effort in October 2003 suffered the fate of bad
timing, falling smack in the middle of the 2.6-test
series, which had started in July and led to a
2.6.0 announcement in December 2003. Wichert got some work
done on the patch at that time and apparently
has been maintaining it privately until June 2004, when he
tried again to submit it. This time, with the kernel
still in some amount of flux at a recent 2.6.6 release
(at the time of this writing 2.6.7 also has come out),
Wichert's patch got a much better reception, and it
looks as though a .deb target will be accepted into
the kernel without much fuss.
</p><p>
For a long time, <span   class="bold"><b>Mel Gorman</b></span> has maintained
on-line documentation of the 2.4 and 2.6 <span   class="bold"><b>Virtual
Memory</b></span> Subsystem. After Linus Torvalds'
surprise move to replace the subsystem en masse in
the early 2.4 releases, documentation was scarce or
nonexistent. Mel worked like a dog to describe its
inner workings and to offer them on-line as a free
resource, and his work eventually was picked up by
Prentice-Hall for inclusion in the Bruce Perens Open
Source Series. The book, called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Understanding the
Linux Virtual Memory Manager</em></span>, is a down-and-dirty
examination of one of the most difficult aspects of
the Linux kernel.
</p><p>
The relationship between the kernel and the <span   class="bold"><b>C
compiler</b></span> is one of constant controversy. When a
kernel release won't compile, often it is not entirely
clear whether the problem is with the C code in the
kernel or with the compiler's attempt to convert
that C code into machine language opcodes. Lately,
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> and others have begun to speculate
that future versions of Linux, perhaps in the 2.8
or 3.0 series, would require a GCC version beyond
3.3. Linus cited bad handling of aliasing in earlier
GCC versions, but the compiler people are likely
to have their own views on what is broken in their
code and what isn't. In any case, it's not unusual
for the kernel to require a tool upgrade, but every
time it happens, the break in compatibility opens the
floodgates for requiring other tool upgrades. The flip
side is that it is generally preferable to require no
tool upgrades at all, so the user has as easy a time
as possible upgrading the kernel when they want to.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> has taken official
responsibility for being the <span   class="bold"><b>sysfs</b></span>
maintainer. He was forced out into the open by
<span   class="bold"><b>Christian Gmeiner</b></span>, who had been trying to identify
the sysfs maintainer to answer a coding question.
Before then, no one was listed in the MAINTAINERS file,
but Greg has said he'll submit a patch at some point
to update that with his own contact information. The
sysfs project has advanced quite far in the 2.5
and 2.6 time frame, and is now the preferred method
to interface with the running kernel. Of course,
some folks still use /proc and other mechanisms, but
they gently are corrected and have been gradually
(and sometimes quickly) coming around to the new
ideas. sysfs has established itself
quite successfully over the past couple of years.
</p><p>
Write support for <span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft's NT
filesystem</b></span>
(NTFS) is not exactly a holy grail of computing but,
nevertheless, it has been a persistent itch that some
programmers have felt a technical need or personal
compulsion to scratch. <span   class="bold"><b>Anton
Altaparmakov</b></span>
is one of these and recently has announced a step
in the &ldquo;write&rdquo; direction for NTFS: the ability to
overwrite files that already are resident on the
filesystem. Along with this, the NTFS driver also
performs some housekeeping chores that previously had
to be done by hand to prevent corruption. Clearly,
NTFS is not yet ready for hard-core use and still
is best for users needing to copy data out of their old
disks, but it seems a time will one day come when
full-on NTFS support will be available in Linux.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>PC9800</b></span> sub-architecture is slated to be
dropped from the 2.6 tree. The hardware is obsolete,
which is not necessarily grounds for removing a
feature from the kernel. But, in addition to that,
the PC9800 code is unmaintained, which certainly
is grounds for removing a feature. Linus Torvalds has
made it abundantly clear that it doesn't matter even
if there are users clamoring for a feature; if code is
broken and no one will fix it, out it goes. Of course,
thanks to the proprietary <span   class="bold"><b>BitKeeper</b></span> revision
control system, it is easier now to put the code back
into the kernel once a maintainer is found. And, among
other justifications for putting unmaintained code on
the chopping block is that it does get the attention
of people who might then choose to maintain it.
</p><p>
Another bit of code that may end up being dropped
from the 2.6 tree is the venerable <span   class="bold"><b>UMSDOS</b></span>
feature. Back in the old days, UMSDOS was used to
install Linux within an existing MS-DOS partition, so
folks could experiment with it without repartitioning
their drives. Nowadays, UMSDOS is not used as much,
but its historical value is significant, so much so
that Linus Torvalds, <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> and the
other kernel maintainers might be happy to leave it
in the kernel for posterity's sake. Unfortunately,
however, UMSDOS is currently broken in 2.6, which
greatly reduces the chances that it will be kept
around. Without a maintainer to nurse it back to
health, the tool that introduced many folks to Linux
in the early days may become only a memory.
