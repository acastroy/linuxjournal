Although the shipping now of a high-end Linux workstation from a major computer
manufacturer is not the news it was in the late 1990s, the arrival of
the A Pro workstation is nonetheless important and not only for its
pedigree. With it, IBM has created a capable Red Hat Linux ES-based workstation featuring dual AMD Opteron processors with gobs of
room for expansion.
</p><p>
The A Pro provided for review has the following features:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Two AMD Opteron 248 series processors running at 2.2GHz each.
</p></li><li><p>
4GB, um, 3GB of memory out of a possible 16GBs (more on memory below)
</p></li><li><p>
One 36GB SCSI hard drive.
</p></li><li><p>
An NVIDIA Quadro FX 1100 GPU.
</p></li><li><p>
Mouse/keyboard and other miscellaneous bits.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
As shipped, the A Pro costs $7,066, according to the
IBM store on May 25th, 2004. Options are available.
</p><p>
When I worked for Linux hardware company VA Research, we always
were amazed at&mdash;no matter how much integration work we'd put into customizing
a distribution&mdash;how many of our customers would reload the machine with
their favorite flavor of Linux as soon as it hit their loading docks. I'm
not certain this situation has changed, but I've chosen to review the machine
as delivered.
</p><p>
The review machine did not ship with recovery media, but the contact
from IBM has assured me that the machine does ship with recovery CD-ROMs,
so that's good.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ad580.0x15a66e0"></a>
The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing you notice after slapping the Power button is the
sound. Is it quiet? Well, for a dual Opteron, the noise level is what one
would
expect. IBM has done some nice work to cut down on the noise, such as
adding rubber grommets on the fan mounts and providing some solid
thick steel in the construction of the workstation's case. It is not
whisper-quiet by any means, and I think that will limit the A Pro's use to the
professional who needs this much capability.
As I noted before, volume is a relative thing, and I think
this system probably is quieter than it should be, considering the expansion
capabilities presented by the A Pro. Also, this thing weighs a ton.
</p><p>
One nit about the hardware: it should be noted that it didn't recognize
my monitor without tweaking. Not recognizing my monitor, an NEC
Multisync FP1350x, was pretty odd, but no worries, redhat-config-xfree86
worked well enough to get X up and running.
</p><p>
I did not have an opportunity to span the screen to two monitors;
as shipped, the NVIDIA driver does support such a configuration. The
NVIDIA driver is proprietary software but commonly is used because it is
considered to be faster than the open-source driver and supports more of
the card's features.
</p><p>
An odd thing was some obnoxious noise (tick tick), over the
audio subsystem (spurt tick), and it occurred whether you (tick) had your
phones plugged in the front or back jacks. It really was annoying, and
considering the system noise this thing puts out, the additional noise
might qualify as a quality-of-life issue.
</p><p>
IBM engineers thoughtfully provide extra screws attached to the strut
spanning the card cage in front of the motherboard, but inexplicably,
they don't tie down or otherwise tuck away any of the internal cables,
which can impede airflow and otherwise disrupt the machine's thermal
performance. You could write this off to the pre-production nature
of review machines, but it also can indicate a less than careful hand at
manufacturing. Another nit is the quality of the mouse and keyboard. The
keyboard is your standard generic keyboard, but the mouse is awful and
made me want to smash it with a hammer.
</p><p>
The machine they sent came with 4GB of memory. The BIOS, however,
has a hole of 1GB, making the fourth gigabyte disappear. So, effectively,
if you buy a machine with more than 3GB of memory&mdash;something
64-bit computer users want, mind you&mdash;you are paying a tax of one
gigabyte.
</p><p>
I wouldn't recommend buying an A Pro until IBM fixes this memory loss
situation. This is doubly
vexing because at the time of this writing, IBM was offering machines
with up to 16GB on its Web site, with no note that you would be
losing out expensively.
[<span   class="emphasis"><em>IBM has since updated its Web site with information on the memory hole
issue. See sidebar.  &mdash;Ed.</em></span>]
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ad580.0x15a6a50"></a>
The Software</h2></div></div><p>
The A Pro appears to be aimed solidly at a graphic workstation market.
As such, I tested it using some GIS exploration software I
have experience with, so I could get a feel for how well IBM has succeeded
at providing a machine for that market.
</p><p>
The machine ships with a pretty standard Red Hat Enterprise Server
load. As mentioned above, there were a few hiccups during load, mostly
connected to video configuration and port selection. Past that, it
doesn't look like IBM did much at all to the distribution, short of
loading the NVIDIA driver as noted above. Although I'd like to see more
&ldquo;welcome to your A Pro Super Machine, here's what you've
got&rdquo;, a stock
distribution is less likely to be overwritten immediately, so IBM's
decision is
understandable.
</p><p>
Partitioning was done competently in my opinion, with /var suitably
reined in. When you are in the Linux hardware business you
quickly realize there is no one true partitioning scheme. I imagine
you would want to tell IBM your preferred layout if you were to buy in
quantity, though. Like many Linux users, I have a set of things I do to
any base load&mdash;change Mozilla's search to Google, set up the monitor
to reflect my ideas about color depth and resolution&mdash;and the system
didn't gag on anything I did to it in that vein.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ad580.0x15a6cb8"></a>
Application Support</h2></div></div><p>
The A Pro comes with the regular array of apps, including Mozilla, OpenOffice.org and
everything else that ships with Red Hat ES. IBM chose to load all the apps,
which is a valid decision for a desktop machine. Again, when buying,
you might want to specify the parameters of your load.
</p><p>
Java is the only major language not supported out of the box,
unless you consider Pascal major. This struck me as odd considering
IBM's dedication to the language.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ad580.0x159d6a8"></a>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux Racer</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
Games are a good way to test the OpenGL subsystem, and they also are fun.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Tux
Racer</em></span> ran fine&mdash;no graphic glitching. The sound was not turned on out of
the box, though, so I set that up using the standard Red Hat sound card setup
program to good result. It struck me as odd that IBM hadn't done this
as part of the load.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ad580.0x159d860"></a>
TerraVision Test</h2></div></div><p>
Because I wanted a program that could test the graphics,
processors and memory handling of this machine, I chose the geographical
exploration application TerraVision, which allows you to do
3-D flythroughs of GIS height map data with textures created
from satellite data. I loaded four data sets into the system&mdash;the Palo
Alto resolution set, global set, Lawrence Livermore and San
Francisco&mdash;all at various resolutions, spanning 1km to 3 meters. This represents a
total of about 4GBs of data, and although the program is good with swapping
the data into the program's memory, it is quite consumptive. The A Pro performed
quite well&mdash;no real glitching of the data set and the flythrough was
smooth. You can download TerraVision and a number of data sets off
the SRI Web site (<a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/TerraVision" target="_self">www.ai.sri.com/TerraVision</a>).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14ad580.0x159d9c0"></a>
Price and Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
When comparing the A Pro against two white box vendors, the IBM machine
seems to run about $1,800 US more. Is it worth it? Perhaps,
as IBM's casework and layout generally is excellent, but I have to admit
I wasn't overwhelmed with the machine to the tune of $1,800, mostly due
to the noise profile. I have to say, from a sound perspective, it was a
relief to shut off the A Pro, which is never a good thing. The Opteron is
a cool-running 64-bit chip, so it shouldn't take this many decibels to cool it.
</p><p>
The case is designed to hold and power a vast number of drives, so it has cooling to spare, but there
is no clear way to turn down the fans and make them
less intrusive. The scope of the machine should
be taken into account as the valid excuse for the
noise level, however. If you need the beefiest, most solid
workstation on the market, then the IBM A Pro is what you'll
be buying, and I think you'd be both happy and well
served by it.

IBM Responds to the &ldquo;Memory Hole&rdquo;</b></p><p>
The IBM IntelliStation A Pro uses an x86 industry-standard method to assign memory space for drivers
of installed devices, which indicates that
less memory is available to the operating system than
the actual &ldquo;physical&rdquo; memory installed in the system.
The memory reported by the operating system does not
account for space reserved for the drivers that must
reside in memory for devices such as the network
controller, SCSI, IEEE 1394 and graphics cards.
</p><p>
The A Pro is packed with integrated technologies to
provide our high-end customers with the scalability
and functionality they demand. The industry-standard
method implemented in the A Pro has an architectural
limitation, because it is an x86-based system that
must support both 32- and 64-bit operating systems.
Therefore, the system BIOS must allocate memory for
these device drivers within the first 4GB of memory
in order to support the 32-bit operating systems.
</p><p>
As the first worldwide tier-one vendor to ship
x86 64-bit capable workstations, IBM is leading the
design of new solutions to take advantage of the full
capabilities of the IntelliStation A Pro. We are in
the process of working with our hardware and software
vendors to design an open solution to eliminate
the memory restriction in systems running a 64-bit
operating system in future releases of the A Pro.
