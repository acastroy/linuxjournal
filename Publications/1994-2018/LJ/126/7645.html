Wireless Questions</h4><p>
I have been reading <i  >LJ</i> for a few years now, and I am
amazed at the transformation of the articles and
content.
I especially like Robin Rowe's articles about
technology in the movie industry. He tends to have a
lot of inside info about DreamWorks and ILM that I
find interesting. Please keep these articles coming.
Marcel gives some great tips for newbies and casual
experimenters, which I appreciate, and I think the
French theme is orginal and entertaining.
There was an article about GNU Radio in the April 2004
issue. The article glazes over the issue of how the
input stream is obtained from the A/D (sound card or
PC Card) and piped to the processing application. I
have an interest in this software for use in my
master's thesis. Could this be explained?
</p><p>One more thing&mdash;what is an inexpensive PCMCIA wireless card that is
compatible with Linux?


<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Michael Wallace  <br><br>
</p><p>
The September 2004 article by Eric Blossom featured a step-by-step FM
listening project that should help with your question.
Hope you enjoyed it. All of the common wireless
cards are compatible&mdash;check your distribution's
hardware list. The least expensive one we use is an
Actiontec HWC01170-01.  &mdash;Ed.

Check Out gdesklets</h4><p>
I am pretty new to the <i  >Linux Journal</i> world, so
forgive me if you have already covered this topic, but
I recently read an article about SuperKaramba [<i  >LJ</i>,
May 2004] and just
wanted to suggest writing about gdesklets as well. In
my experience, they are much harder to install and
actually get working than SuperKaramba, and I think
it's only fair for non-KDE users to have some desktop
eye candy as well.

Browsing SMB Shares</h4><p>
I read the <i  >Linux Journal</i> article &ldquo;It's a Cross
Platform, All Right!&rdquo;, by Marcel Gagn&eacute; with enthusiasm and excitement
that we finally have a very useful Linux SMB
browser. Each and every time I would try to open any MS Windows
folder in the SMB4K &ldquo;Network&rdquo; window the following
message would appear:


<pre     class="programlisting">
An error occurred:

smbmnt must be installed suid for direct users mounts (1000,1000)
smbmnt failed: 1
</pre>

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Pete Mackies  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Marcel replies:</b></span> first of all, let me say
&ldquo;Thanks&rdquo; for reading the
column and for writing. I do appreciate it.
As with a number of these projects, it is still in
pre-1.0 development phase, but I had great success
using the tool, both in building and in terms
of use. Had there been huge problems, I would not
have featured it. I've been so impressed with it that
I've been using it as my Windows share browser since I
wrote about it in the article roughly two months ago.
</p><p>
That's a problem with the smbmnt program
and the permissions it allows, not
specifically with SMB4K. There's a note
about this in the FAQ on the SMB4K Web site
(<a href="http://smb4k.berlios.de/faq.html" target="_self">smb4k.berlios.de/faq.html</a>). Specifically,
the smbmnt binary is not SUID root and therefore
doesn't allow anyone but root to mount. On my test
system (Mandrake 10), the smbmnt binary is setuid
by default.
</p><p>
You should be able to solve the problem you are
experiencing by changing smbmnt's permissions.
Start by doing an <tt  >ls -l</tt> on smbmnt to make sure
you aren't pointing to a different binary (as on
my Mandrake system). Then, change the permissions
as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
chmod +s /usr/bin/smbmnt
</pre>
</p><p>
That should allow you to mount shares in non-root accounts.
</p><p>
I understand your concern, but I feel that when
presented with a highly promising piece of software
like SMB4K, it is sometimes worthwhile to mention it,
despite its pre-1.0 status. Furthermore, I never write
about something without having personally confirmed
that it works. Unfortunately, I don't have access to
every conceivable distribution, and it is possible that
things don't always work perfectly on other systems.
In the meantime, I hope you'll have some luck with
the solution I offer. Thanks again for writing,
and do take care out there.

Another Linux Cat</h4><p>
Here is a picture of my cat, Tosca, who seems
to enjoy <i  >Linux Journal</i> as much as I do. Often,
when I arrive home with a fresh new <i  >LJ</i> and sit
down to read the many interesting articles, he'll
come along and lie down on top of it on my table,
and then fall asleep! He's also a big fan of Linux
and specially the SolarWinds GL screensaver.

Bring <i  >LJ</i> to Europe</h4><p>
I think it would be great to have a European <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I think that
there's a lot going on here that would give lots of interesting
articles. Europe, besides having a larger population than the USA,
has much more Linux aficionados, so I think the
&ldquo;gold mine&rdquo; is here, and a Eurpean version of <i  >Linux Journal</i> could be great.

Video Editing Software, Please</h4><p>
I've been a subscriber to <i  >LJ</i> for more than a few issues now.
Thanks for the great work and dedication. I get a kick out of at least
one section per issue, so keep at it!
I don't remember seeing any pieces related to Non-Linear Video

like to see some articles about the tools that are available in Linux
for this.

Jump Pages for Articles&mdash;Good or Bad?</h4><p>
Would it be all right if I'm candid? I thought so.
I have a couple of thoughts concerning your choice
to move the on-line resources to your Web site.
I got a subscription to a magazine, not to a Web site.
Consequently, I want this to be self-contained.
I don't want to have to go to the Web site to get
the URLs.
</p><p>
The very first URL I went to (<a href="../124/7609.html" target="_self">/article/7609</a>) was
not there. If you don't provide the resources as
promised, you are doing a great disservice to your
readers. It would be much, much better to use a
little space on paper rather than to do this.
</p><p>
This could be okay, if you had user feedback like
the wonderful feedback on php.net, which allows
users to share their experiences. Then, this new
approach to using the Web site would cause me to find
instantaneous feedback like corrections and other tips
that pertain to each article, and further, I would
likely go to this page, as I would want additional
information on the topic of the article.
</p><p>
It could be okay to not have to type in long URLs,
but really that's only rarely an issue, and if
you were truly concerned, I'm sure you could provide
shortened URLs. This is really just a lame excuse
so you can get more traffic on your site.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Shane   <br><br>
</p><p>
We'll be candid right back then. We'd rather fit
in one extra original article per issue than a chunk
of URLs for all the other articles in the magazine.
And, you need a browser and a Net connection to use
the URLs anyway.
The late jump page was bad, and our fault. We're
going to adjust our Web and print calendars to fix
that for future issues. In the future, the jump pages
will be up before you see the issue. Try it now.
The jump pages are set up for comments in a threaded
Slashdot-like style just like the Web-only articles
on <a href="http://linuxjournal.com" target="_self">linuxjournal.com</a>.  &mdash;Ed.

Bad Magazine CD, Bad, Bad</h4><p>
I have been rereading several magazines that I have
bought over the last couple of months concerning
Linux. At present, I am using Red Hat 8 as it is the
only one I can get to operate on my laptop.
</p><p>
I recently purchased a copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Format</em></span> from
England with a copy of Mandrake 10 on the cover.
It loaded on my laptop but I was unable to use it as far
as the Internet goes&mdash;no drivers and no information
concerning an external modem.
</p><p>
I am sure that many people who are fed up with
Windows would very much like to try Linux, but with
the extreme difficultly of finding drivers and not
knowing if any particular external modem will work, we
are defeating our purpose in trying to promote Linux
to many people.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Herb Taylor  <br><br>
</p><p>
There are often better sources of
Linux CDs than magazines. Here's
some advice on picking a distribution:

Layout Software for Books and More</h4><p>
It's been a long time since I've seen an article in
<i  >LJ</i> about LaTeX. With the now-mature LyX GUI front
end,
it's more than ready for prime time in business.
LyX will not replace OpenOffice.org, for example, for simple
letters, invoices and the like (although it can). But,
for reports, articles, books, slide presentations and
other printed materials, including PDF distribution,
it cannot be exceeded.
I'm using it for my book (to be published this autumn
by Springer-Verlag) using their svmono class file, so
I can send it to them essentially camera-ready. LyX
is much like Linux itself; use the half-hour tutorial
and you're immediately productive, but the depth and
breadth of what it can do is a never-ending learning
process.
The on-line support is outstanding, and the output,
being typeset, is visibly better than anything done
with a word processor, even on the same 600dpi
laser printer.

Why Mozilla?</h4><p>
I read Mr McFarlane's article on cross-platform
development in Mozilla (&ldquo;A GUI for PS(1) Built with
Mozilla&rdquo;, July 2004), and much of his book (<span   class="emphasis"><em>Rapid Application
Development with Mozilla</em></span>) as well. I salute him
for his work explaining the Mozilla environment.
</p><p>
For all that I am a fan of Mozilla, but I must confess
that I do not see its appeal as a development
platform. The more I learn about development with
Mozilla, the less I understand what it offers. As far
as I can tell, Mozilla development requires that one
master at least XUL (the Mozilla GUI layout language),
CSS, JavaScript, RDF and the Mozilla template
language (another XML dialect). In order to get your
software working, you must also contend with a fairly
arcane process of software installation, in which
you must place your code, and RDF to describe it,
in very specific places in the directory structure.
Even after overcoming these hurdles, one is left
with a fairly restricted set of interface tools.
For example, if you want something that features
free-form drawing, like a Canvas, you are out of luck.
Finally, there are only the weakest of debugging
tools to help you grapple with all of this machinery.
</p><p>
In contrast, consider Tcl/Tk, PerlTk or the Python equivalents
(wxWidgets is a reasonable alternative to Tk as a widget set). In
this case, there is only one notation to deal with and the debugging
tools are good. In addition, these languages all feature some sort of
read-eval-print loop for rapid prototyping and testing. Finally, all
of these approaches are platform-independent. So what application
development niche does Mozilla fill?
</p><p>
Please note that I am not asking this because I want to start a
programming language war, nor because I want to denigrate the work of
McFarlane and others! No, this is a serious question, and it's one to
which I'd like to have a good answer. I am a fan of the Mozilla
Project, and I have invested a fair amount of time in understanding
the development process. I'd like to see a way to use this stuff, but
right now the hurdles seem too high.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Robert Goldman  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nigel replies:</b></span>
I note your puzzlement and take no umbrage at such well-put
remarks. Here's my brief take.
</p><p>
Mozilla negatives:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
We're only at version 1. There's lots of nasty problems in
any version 1, and lots of missing items.
</p></li><li><p>
XML learning curve for traditional programmers&mdash;it may not
seem obvious, but there is a collection of people who
just love stitching applications together using XML.
The XML learning curve is also a toolset&mdash;one different
from the traditional 3GL toolset. One can get a lot done
with it.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Mozilla positives:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Mozilla applications can run from chrome, local disk or
across the Internet without change. That's powerful flexibility.
The execution environment is widely deployed and highly secure.
At least on the graphics side, Mozilla is better integrated
in some areas with native GUIs than, say, Tcl/Tk.
</p></li><li><p>
Linux lacks a Visual Basic-like easy-to-use type of environment.
Mozilla aspires to a degree to achieve that.
</p></li><li><p>
Mozilla development proceses are a natural extension of Web
development processes; there's already an audience and a
work flow.
</p></li><li><p>
Mozilla uses no cryptic syntax. JavaScript, XML and CSS are
all well-established standards. Niche syntax, like Python and
Tcl, are unlikely to get as widespread support. That's not
to dismiss those languages; they're good. It's just that they're
also odd.
</p></li><li><p>
Web delivery&mdash;with broadband increasingly available, Web delivery
of applications is a real option for service-oriented businesses.
</p></li><li><p>
Records management&mdash;there are few free 4GL-style tools available
on Linux. Records management applications are a very large
segment of the computer industry. Mozilla presents front-end
opportunities for vertical apps. Using 3GL code to develop advanced
4GL apps is just not sustainable in the long term (I think).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This is my two cents. I agree that what Mozilla does can be done in other
ways. I think that there are ways of leveraging Mozilla that are
uniquely efficient, though.

Thrilling USB Story</h4><p>
I read Greg Kroah-Hartman's article on USB snooping
[<i  >LJ</i>, August 2004] with great interest, not because I'm
interested in USB devices or CrypToken devices,
but because of Greg's writing style. Learning how he
thought, and the false steps he took, kept me reading
the article. Greg clearly understands that articles
not only need to live up to technical standards,
but must be fun to read!

Ultimate Linux Box Hardware</h4><p>
In the sidebar to the Ultimate Linux Box article in
the August 2004 issue, you note that if there is any one thing
to buy this year, it's an HDTV card. You also talk
about doing articles next year on pre-ban cards.
So, do you have any card suggestions? I may &ldquo;kick myself&rdquo; for not
getting a card now, but I'll kick myself more if I spend a couple
hundred dollars on a card that won't function under Linux.
Thanks for any input, and thanks for a consistently great read.

Photo of the Month; Penguin Hatching Season</h4><p>
At 9:25 pm on the evening of July 14th, Sebastian Phillip Gagn&eacute; came into
this
world. He weighed in at 7 pounds and 14 ounces (3.565kg) and was just
over
21 and a half inches long (55cm). This beautiful blue-eyed wonder also
has a
crop of thick luxurious brown hair. Both baby and mother are doing
great!

Attached is a picture that requires a little explanation...as you
