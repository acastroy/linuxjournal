SELinux needs to store extra security information about
each file, and Linux makes it possible with extended attributes.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21db2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
With NSA Security-Enhanced Linux now integrated into the 2.6 kernel and
making its way into distributions, an increasing number of people
likely will be installing SELinux and experimenting with it. Given this
increasing user base,
this article takes a closer look at filesystem labeling under
SELinux.
This is an intermediate-level article. Although a brief review of some
SELinux concepts is provided in the next section, pointers to more
detailed information can be found in the on-line Resources section.
In particular, Faye Coker's introductory article
[<i  >LJ</i>, August 2003] is recommended as a starting point.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21db450"></a>
SELinux Overview: Labeling and Access Control</h2></div></div><p>
In SELinux, important objects, such as tasks, inodes and files are
assigned a security context, a label that encapsulates the security attributes
associated with an object. Under standard SELinux, this label is a colon-separated ASCII string composed of values for identity, role and type.
</p><p>
These labels are assigned by a kernel component called the security server,
using rules loaded into the security policy database.
The security context label on my workstation's /etc/shadow file
is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
system_u:object_r:shadow_t
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21db608"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where <tt  >system_u</tt> and <tt  >object_r</tt> are generic identity and role values
used for files. shadow_t is the type of the file, an attribute
that determines how the file can be accessed. A process, for example,
would be labeled like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root:staff_r:staff_t
</pre>
</p><p>
The SELinux identity here is root, assigned by SELinux as a
more permanent form of identity than the standard UNIX identity.
The role is staff_r, indicating that the process has all of
the permissions assigned to that role. The type assigned to
the process is staff_t. For a process, the type attribute
indicates how it is allowed to access objects and interact
with other processes. The type attribute of a process
often is referred to as a domain.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21db870"></a>
Access Control Decisions</h2></div></div><p>
SELinux uses these security context labels to make access control decisions
between processes and objects, but how does this happen?
SELinux has hooks located at strategic points within the core kernel code,
such as the point where a file is about to be read by a user. These hooks
allow SELinux to break out of the normal flow of the kernel to request
extended access control decisions. Access control decisions usually are made
between a process (for example, cat) and an object (for example, /etc/shadow) for a specific
permission (read).
</p><p>
Decision requests are sent to the access vector cache (AVC), which passes
requests through to the security server for interpretation. The security
server consults the security policy database and determines a result,
which is cached in the AVC and returned to the SELinux hook.
</p><p>
The SELinux hook then allows the flow to continue or return
EACCES, depending on the decision result. Security context
labels assigned to processes and objects are used to make
these access control decisions.
</p><p>
Refer to Figure 1 for a simplified view of this process.

</p><p>
The following code demonstrates how security context labels are used on a
real system, as seen by a user:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ id -Z
root:staff_r:staff_t

$ cat /etc/shadow
cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied
</pre>
</p><p>
The audit log records the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
avc:  denied  { read } for  pid=13653 exe=/bin/cat
name=shadow dev=hda6 ino=1361441 scontext=root:staff_r:staff_t
tcontext=system_u:object_r:shadow_t tclass=file
</pre>
</p><p>
Translation: the cat program, labeled with the security context
<tt  >root:staff_r:staff_t</tt>, was denied permission to read a file labeled
<tt  >system_u:object_r:shadow_t</tt>.
</p><p>
SELinux knows nothing about the meaning of cat or
/etc/shadow. It is concerned only with their respective
security context labels, the class of the target object
(in this case, it's a file) and the permission being requested.
</p><p>
An important aspect of SELinux design is that labels encapsulate
all security attributes of an object, and they are interpreted only by the
security server in the kernel and by libselinux in user space. The rest
of the kernel code and user space merely pass labels around as opaque data.
New security attributes can be added to labels without having to recompile
applications or redesign core SELinux code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21dbe48"></a>
Extended Attributes</h2></div></div><p>
On a typical Linux disk-based filesystem, each file is identified
uniquely by an inode containing critical metadata for the file, including UNIX
ownership and access control information. When the kernel references
a file, its inode is read from disk into memory. A standard UNIX
permission check simply uses the information present within the inode.
SELinux extends standard UNIX security and uses security context labels
to make extended access control decisions.
</p><p>
Linux implements Extended Attributes, also called EAs or xattrs. These
are name/value pairs associated with files as an extension
to normal inode-based attributes. EAs allow functionality
to be added to filesystems in a standardized way so that
interfaces to the attributes are filesystem-independent.
Examples of EA functionality are access control lists (ACLs),
storage of character-set metadata alongside file data and SELinux
security context labeling.
</p><p>
EAs are stored within namespaces, allowing different classes
of EAs to be managed separately. ACLs are stored in the
system.posix_acl_access and system.posix_acl_default
namespaces. SELinux security context labels are stored in the
security.selinux namespace. See attr(5) for more information
on EAs under Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21dc000"></a>
EA Security Labeling</h2></div></div><p>
EAs can be managed manually with the getfattr(1) and setfattr(1) utilities.
For example, to view the SELinux security context label of a file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ getfattr -n security.selinux /tmp/foo
getfattr: Removing leading '/' from absolute
path names
# file: tmp/foo
security.selinux="root:object_r:sysadm_tmp_t\000"
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21dc160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Notice the specification of the EA security namespace. A wrapper utility
called getfilecon(1) is provided for use with SELinux. It saves you
from having to specify the EA namespace, and it has a cleaner output.
</p><p>
The use of text-based labels ensures that meaningful,
human-readable security attributes are stored along with the
file data. These labels can be preserved or translated if
the filesystem is mounted on a different system, possibly
with a different security policy. A counter example is the
way the owner of a file is stored as a numeric UID in the
file's inode. The UID typically is mapped to a meaningful
value by way of /etc/passwd; it may not have the same meaning on
a different system.
</p><p>
For a filesystem to support SELinux security context labels, it needs EA
support and a handler for the EA security namespace. Such filesystems
currently include ext3, ext2, XFS and ReiserFS; the last uses an external
patch. In addition, the devpts filesystem has a dummy security handler
that allows
EA-based access to the in-kernel labels of ptys.
</p><p>
So, when are files labeled? During an SELinux system
installation, the setfiles(8) utility typically is used to
label all of the files in filesystems that support EA security
labeling. Package management tools such as RPM also may label
files during installation, while system administrators
often need to set security contexts manually with chcon(1)
or setfilecon(1).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21dc370"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Evolution of SELinux Filesystem Labeling</b></p><p>
The first release of SELinux in 2000 used a different mechanism
for labeling filesystems than is used by the extended attributes approach
discussed in this article. Persistent security IDs (PSIDs),
integer representations of security context labels, were stored
in an unused field of the ext2 inode. Mapping files on each
filesystem were used by SELinux to look up a file's PSID by
inode and then to map the PSID to a security context label.
</p><p>
This approach had the disadvantage of needing to modify each
filesystem separately to support PSIDs. Thus, it was not a good general solution
for extended security in the upstream kernel.
</p><p>
With the LSM Project, a generalized access
control framework was implemented for the Linux kernel. As
no filesystem-specific hooks are used in LSM, SELinux moved away from the
modified filesystem approach and stored PSIDs in a normal file next to
the mapping files. This allowed SELinux to be used purely as an
LSM application with no kernel patching. It also allowed labeling to work for more
filesystems, but it was not optimal in terms of performance and consistency.
Accessing files from within the kernel remains generally problematic.
</p><p>
As part of the process of merging SELinux into the mainline kernel,
with more feedback from the community, SELinux moved to the current
filesystem labeling model based on extended attributes.
Extended attributes provide applications with a standard API, eliminating
the need for custom system calls to manipulate security labels, while
filesystems also can be
used similarly by other security modules, even on the same filesystem,
using the separation provided by EA namespaces.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21dc688"></a>
File Creation</h2></div></div><p>
When a file is created, a matching rule in the security
policy typically describes how to assign a label based on the security
contexts of the parent directory and the current task. Here's an example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ id -Z
root:staff_r:staff_t
$ ls -dZ /tmp
drwxrwxrwt+ root  root system_u:object_r:tmp_t /tmp
$ touch /tmp/hello
$ getfilecon /tmp/hello
/tmp/hello      root:object_r:staff_tmp_t
</pre>
</p><p>
In this case, the security policy contains a rule that states files
created by staff_t in a directory labeled tmp_t must be labeled with the
type staff_tmp_t. If there is no explicit rule, files are labeled
with the context of the parent directory.
</p><p>
Privileged applications can override the above-stated rule by writing a security
context to /proc/self/attr/fscreate. This security context then
is used to label any newly created files. The setfscreatecon(3) library
function encapsulates this operation.
</p><p>
Unlabeled files may exist if a filesystem has not been labeled
properly before use or if files are created on a filesystem when SELinux is not
enabled. In case of the latter, the SELinux kernel internally assigns a
default context to unlabeled files for AVC calls, but it does not attempt to
relabel them on disk.
To restore a security context label manually, use restorecon(8).
</p><p>
An fsck-like utility is being developed for managing the scenario where
unlabeled files have been created. To be run on boot, this utility will
ensure that all files are labeled correctly before the system
enters multiuser mode.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21dc9a0"></a>
Labeling Behaviors</h2></div></div><p>
In the preceding section, we discussed file labeling for filesystems
that both support EAs on disk and have handlers for the EA security
namespace. When such a filesystem is mounted normally, it is said to
use xattr labeling behavior.
</p><p>
When a filesystem is initialized by SELinux, such as when it is being
mounted, a log message is generated that reads:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELinux: initialized (dev hda6, type ext3), uses xattr
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21dcb58"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The <tt  >uses xattr</tt> clause means the filesystem uses
the xattr labeling
behavior described above.
</p><p>
Many filesystems do not support EAs, and of those that do, not all
have security namespace handlers. For on-disk filesystems, it may
be that nobody has done the coding work yet or that EAs simply don't
make sense for legacy filesystems such as vfat.
</p><p>
A proliferation of pseudo-filesystems have developed under Linux.
Filesystems are becoming an increasingly favored user-kernel
API mechanism. The most obvious of these is procfs, which is
an interface between user space and various kernel components.
Due to the long history of procfs, it has accumulated a lot of
cruft, and new user-kernel filesystem APIs are encouraged to
be implemented by way of separate filesystems. These filesystems
are kernel resident and have no intrinsic EA support.
Examples include usbfs, sysfs and selinuxfs.
</p><p>
Such non-EA cases are managed with a variety of labeling behaviors,
according to rules in the security policy for each filesystem type.
</p><p>
The transition SIDs labeling behavior is used for devpts, tmpfs
and shmfs filesystems. Files in these filesystems are labeled on demand
in the kernel, based on the security contexts of the current
task and a security context specified for the filesystem in policy.
</p><p>
devpts is a special-case transition SIDs filesystem. It provides EA
API access to ptys by way of a dummy EA security handler. Privileged applications,
such as sshd, use this feature to relabel ptys, overriding the transition
SID labels.
</p><p>
The task SIDs labeling behavior simply labels the file with
the same security context as the current task. It is used for
pipes and sockets created in the pipefs and sockfs filesystems,
respectively.
</p><p>
The genfs_contexts labeling behavior is used for filesystems
unsuited to xattr, transition SIDs and task SIDs
labeling. In the security policy, security context labels
are assigned to filesystem/pathname pairs. The purpose of the
pathname component is to allow finer-grained labeling of the
filesystem. This feature is important for procfs in particular,
which is a jumble of readable and writable kernel data, including
the sysctl interface.
</p><p>
Most non-EA filesystems use genfs_contexts labeling, usually
with the entire filesystem set to a single security context.
Common examples include sysfs, vfat, nfs and usbdevfs.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21d3808"></a>
Mountpoint Labeling</h2></div></div><p>
A new feature included with the 2.6.3 kernel is mountpoint labeling,
also referred to as context mounts. The main purpose of this is to
allow the security context of an entire filesystem to be specified by
using
a mount option. Mountpoint labeling can be applied to any type of
filesystem and overrides its normal labeling behavior.
</p><p>
A specific use of mountpoint labeling is to allow different NFS
mounts to be labeled separately at mount time. It also is useful
for general ad hoc mounting of filesystems that do not support EA
security labeling and for mounting EA-labeled filesystems
labeled elsewhere. The latter may be important in forensic work,
for example.
</p><p>
Legacy filesystems with no labels also may need to be mounted under
an SELinux-enabled OS. Even though the filesystem type supports EA security
labeling, we may not want to add persistent security context labels to
these filesystems. Mountpoint labeling allows us to assign
kernel-resident labels that are not written to disk.
</p><p>
As mountpoint labeling is a new feature and is not widely documented,
let's discuss it in a little more detail.
</p><p>
When SELinux is enabled in the kernel, three new mount options are
provided for mountpoint labeling:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
context: causes every file on the filesystem, and the filesystem
itself, to be labeled with the specified security context. The
/proc/self/attr/fscreate API discussed above is ignored for
the filesystem. This overrides existing labeling behavior,
changing it to mountpoint labeling. Filesystem labels are
read-only to the user with this option, although policy-specified
labeling transitions still operate on filesystems with
EA security labeling support.
</p></li><li><p>
fscontext: sets the label of the aggregate filesystem (that is, the
filesystem itself) to the specified security context. This allows finer-grained control of filesystems by allowing their labels to be set on
a per-mount basis rather than on a per-fs type basis specified in a
policy. As the context option also implements this functionality,
the two options cannot be used together. This option works only for
filesystems with EA security labeling support.
Aggregate filesystem security contexts are used for access control
decisions made during file creation within a specific filesystem, mounting
and unmounting of filesystems, accessing filesystem attributes and
relabeling the filesystem itself.
</p></li><li><p>
defcontext: sets the default security context for unlabeled files, instead of
the value specified in the policy. As with the fscontext option, it works
only for filesystems with EA labeling support and is not valid if context
has been specified, as it too implements this functionality.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In the kernel, SELinux parses and strips out the security mount options
during mount(2), passing normal options through to filesystem-specific
code. Normal filesystems do not need to be aware of the security options,
thus, they do not need to be modified. This is possible because most
filesystems use text name/value pairs for mount options, which
SELinux is able to manipulate easily.
</p><p>
Filesystems with binary mount option data, including NFS, SMBFS, AFS and
Coda,
need to be handled as special cases. Of these, only NFSv3 is supported
at this stage of SELinux development.
</p><p>
Here's an example of how the context option operates, as it is likely
to be the most widely used of the three mount options.
A floppy disk with log files has arrived on our desk, and we'd like to mount it
on our SELinux box and run some log analysis software on it. Due
to the way policy is configured, these files need to be labeled
system_u:object_r:var_log_t for the log analysis software
to work properly. Mounting in this fashion also can help provide a
sandbox for the data on the floppy, allowing SELinux to protect the OS
and the contents of the floppy from each other.
</p><p>
Let's mount the disk:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mount -v -t vfat \
-o context=system_u:object_r:var_log_t \
/dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
/dev/fd0 on /mnt/floppy type vfat
(context=system_u:object_r:var_log_t)
</pre>
</p><p>
What does the audit log say?


<pre     class="programlisting">
SELinux: initialized (dev fd0, type vfat), uses mountpoint labeling
</pre>
</p><p>
This message looks promising. Next, we verify that the files on the disk
are labeled as expected. Normally, you would use getfilecon(1), but
getfattr(1) has more explicit error messages:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ getfattr -n security.selinux /mnt/floppy/access_log
/mnt/floppy/access_log: security.selinux: Operation not supported
</pre>
</p><p>
What is going on here? An <tt  >ls -Z</tt> also shows that
the file has a null
security context:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls -Z /mnt/floppy/access_log
-rwxr-xr-x+  root  root  (null)   /mnt/floppy/access_log
</pre>
</p><p>
The vfat filesystem on the floppy does not have EA support, and its
security context labeling occurs purely within the kernel. It turns out
that this in-kernel labeling is working correctly, but the user-space tools
are not able to view the labels in the EA API. This is a limitation
of the current EA implementation that has yet to be resolved elegantly.
</p><p>
However, there's a sneaky way to see what the labels on the files
are by using the audit log, which always records the security context
of a target object when logging an access message.
</p><p>
The use of getfattr(1) caused the following audit record to be generated:


<pre     class="programlisting">
avc:  denied  { getattr } for  pid=12354 exe=/usr/bin/getfattr
path=/mnt/floppy/access_log dev=fd0 ino=132 scontext=root:staff_r:staff_t
tcontext=system_u:object_r:var_log_t tclass=file
</pre>
</p><p>
So, the file is labeled correctly (system_u:object_r:var_log_t),
per the context mount option passed to the mount command.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21d4410"></a>
Future Work</h2></div></div><p>
Although it is possible to assign security context labels to NFS mounted
filesystems, they operate only locally for access control decisions
within the kernel. No labels are transmitted across the network
with files. Work has been advancing in this area, with SELinux-specific
modifications being made to the NFSv2/v3 protocols and code. Further down
the track, NFSv4 integration is expected to involve labeling over the wire
by way of named attributes, which are part of the more extensible NFSv4
specification. This would allow both the NFS client and server to
implement SELinux security for networked files. Support for other networked
filesystems also would be useful, as would interoperability with
Trusted BSD's SELinux port.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20e3580.0x21d4518"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Backup and Restoration</b></p><p>
One of the many tasks that change for system administrators using SELinux is
backup and restoration. When creating an archive, how will the security
context labels be preserved within the archive? The answer is to use
the highly flexible star(1) utility, which has extended attribute
support.
</p><p>
To manipulate archives with security context labels, use the xattr
option.
When creating archives, you also need to specify the exustar format.
For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ star -xattr -H=exustar -c -f cups-log.star /var/log/cups
</pre>
</p><p>
creates an archive of the /var/log/cups directory, retaining security
context labels on the files.
</p><p>
To extract, simply use the xattr option:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ star -xattr -x -f cups-log.star
$ ls -Z var/log/cups/
-rw-r--r--+ root     sys      system_u:object_r:cupsd_log_t
error_log
-rw-r--r--+ root     sys      system_u:object_r:cupsd_log_t
error_log.1
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the security context labels have been preserved.
