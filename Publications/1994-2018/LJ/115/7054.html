Scribus is a full-featured desktop publishing application
that works with a paste-up model, not the typewriter model
of word processors. Learn to create industry-standard PDF documents
for print.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cc51e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In contemplating the seemingly eternal question&mdash;Is Linux ready for the
Desktop?  &mdash;the recent release of Scribus 1.0 adds one more major
reason to say yes. A frequent complaint is &ldquo;I can't use Linux on
the desktop because I am missing application <span   class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>.&rdquo; Scribus ably fills
a missing piece&mdash;a graphical WYSIWYG page layout application. Linux
users and their *nix cousins now have a versatile and user-friendly
desktop publishing application with fresh approaches to the challenges
of using Linux as a desktop publishing (DTP) platform. Moreover, Scribus
brings other new capabilities beyond DTP with its ability to create PDF
(portable document format)
Web forms and interactive PDF documents.
</p><p>
Thanks to the increasing polish of
important support libraries, like freetype2,
Ghostscript and CUPS, Linux desktop publishing
is a reality. Scribus cleverly works around some
of the potential limitations of Linux and UNIX
as DTP platforms, by the extensive and flexible
use of PDF as an output file format and to a
lesser extent, PDF import. PDF, whose format is
copyrighted by Adobe but licensed at no charge
for other developers' use, offers flexibility,
stability in format and broad application support.
PDF
is similar to PostScript and is well documented by Adobe; the draft PDF 1.5
reference manual is a slim 1,000+
pages. Plus, PDF is supported on almost every modern computing platform
available.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cc53f8"></a>
DTP Applications vs. Word Processors</h2></div></div><p>
At the most simplistic level, creating documents with Scribus is like
grade-school cut and paste. When using the drawing tools, working with Scribus
is like having a canvas. When dealing with text and images, it is like
using a pasteboard. Composing documents with a word processor
is more like working with an intelligent typewriter. Conceptually, it
helps to think of Scribus as a pretty face wrapped around a great
PDF engine&mdash;an engine that greatly reduces the complexity in
creating either press-ready high-resolution PDF files or fully interactive
PDFs. One of the challenges in
creating PDFs, especially press-ready PDFs, is the necessity to
know some of almost 100 distilling options in Adobe Acrobat Distiller.
</p><p>
Scribus is most definitely not a word processor; it belongs to
the family of applications known as page layout programs. Well known DTP
applications include Adobe's PageMaker
(the original) or InDesign and Quark XPress. Scribus is unique
because it is licensed under the GPL, and no other DTP application with
its professional features runs on Linux. Scribus has been ported to the
BSDs, HP-UX and Solaris as well. With the help of KDE-Cygwin, an experimental
version of Scribus also runs on Microsoft Windows 2000. Work on a Mac
OS X version with the GPL'd Qt for OS X is underway as well.

A page layout application is different from word processors in the sense
that it is concerned with laying out text, images and drawings with a
much higher level of precision and control by the designer, which is not
possible and sometimes not desirable with modern word processors. Where
a word processor excels at processing words, only a page
layout program can combine text plus images and other artwork with
exactness and ease. Scribus, for example, has many bits of code to
optimize PostScript output, control color reproduction, layer images
with text and manage high-resolution artwork.
</p><p>
In a page layout application, text is an object, like pictures or
shapes, and is contained within frames. This enables
precise placement and flow of text on a page. With Scribus you
easily can create effects like flipping or running text at angles or
auto-flowing multicolumn text. You can use layers or place objects on
top of each other, otherwise known as masking, to achieve impressive
visual effects. Scribus has special controls for typography to adjust
the layout and spacing of individual letters within words, known as
kerning. You can control the placement of all
objects to within hundredths of an inch or hundredths of a millimeter.
Try thinking of a page layout file as a wrapper&mdash;the last step in
composing a document of any kind destined for print professionally,
in-house or a Web downloadable PDF, where object placement, exact color
matching and formatting are a necessity.
</p><p>
Some of Scribus' major features include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Creating state-of-the-art ISO standard PDF/X-3 conforming high-quality press-ready PDF files for use in commercial pre-press. It is
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> one to support this directly&mdash;a DTP first.
</p></li><li><p>
Creating fully scripted and interactive PDF documents, which include
external links, such as Web links and presentation PDFs &agrave; la MS PowerPoint
or OpenOffice's Impress. You also can create calculated fields and send
user-entered form data to a Web site.
</p></li><li><p>
Using Python as a scripting language. Most serious DTP
applications are scriptable. Python gives Scribus a uniquely
powerful and platform-neutral scripting language. Most other DTP
applications use a custom scripting language or AppleScript,
which does not cross platforms. This ability also enables you
to run third-party Python modules, like the imaging modules,
or to run other Python applications, such as PySol.
</p></li><li><p>
Having full support for CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow and black) color used in commercial printing,
including optional color management, color separations and importing
spot colors in EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files.
</p></li><li><p>
Supporting Unicode text and fonts with freetype2, as well as
right-to-left languages, like Arabic or Hebrew. At the time of this writing,
Scribus has been translated into 19 languages, most recently Czech,
Russian and Indonesian.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cc6790"></a>
Getting and Installing Scribus</h2></div></div><p>
Installing Scribus is straightforward. You can choose to compile from
source or grab one of the third-party packages of Scribus. Details and
locations are in the Scribus on-line documentation. Compiling from source
is the usual <tt  >./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</tt>.
You should have the latest updated versions of Trolltech's
Qt, freetype2, libtiff, libpng and ghostscript available for your
distribution. Scribus 1.0 is optimized for Qt 3.1.2, the latest stable version
at the time of this writing. If you wish to enable color management, you
need the littlecms libraries and some ICC profiles. Scribus also needs
the development libraries for libtiff, libjpeg and libpng. The biggest
issue we have seen when compiling is that the QTDIR environment variable
either is
not set or is set incorrectly. The
documentation contains detailed notes about compiling.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7054f1.large.jpg"><img src="7054f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Scribus tools&mdash;Scribus has easy-to-use palettes, all of
which have tooltips explaining their functions. Clockwise from the
top: 1) The Page palette manages pages and page templates. Adding a
page is drag-and-drop simple. 2) The Measurements palette provides
frequently used editing tools. 3) The PDF toolbar shows how toolbars can be
dragged from the desktop. 4) Outline is a tree diagram
of every object in the document. This assists in selecting objects in
complex documents. 5) Layers allows you to stack objects on top of
each other for stunning effects. 6) The Scrapbook stores
frequently used items.
</p></div></div><p>
Scribus' user interface has been optimized for DTP. You
can drag guides right from the rulers. Measurement units can be changed
with a simple click. The status bar gives users a lot of information and
precise measurements of objects and tools. Although Scribus runs under any
window manager, it has special features when run under KDE, such as desktop drag
and drop, and uses KDE-style plugins.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cc6b00"></a>
Creating Your Masterpiece</h2></div></div><p>
Unlike word processors, you do not simply open a new empty document and
start typing. First, you must create a text frame and then either start
typing or importing some text. My preferred method is to use a text editor,
edit, spell-check and then save and import the text. Similarly, you
do not open The GIMP, then copy and paste. First, create an image frame then
place the image on the page. Image files can be huge, so they are
linked externally. This also ensures that the latest up-to-date image is in
your document. Keeping track of commonly used objects is made easier with
the Scrapbook.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7054f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. User-friendly&mdash;the Scrapbook enables the easy re-use of
objects between pages and documents. You can save scrapbooks separately,
and they can be saved for
projects or single documents. Shown here is an EPS of a full-page map, a full
page of text and a logo. Almost any kind of object can be saved
by right-dragging it from the page to the Scrapbook.
</p></div></div><p>
To help with creating your publication, Scribus comes with a set of useful
and user-friendly drawing tools, including styled lines, polygons, Bezier
curves, tinting or shading of drawn objects and gradients, which is a
special way of blending one or two colors to add shadowing or dimension
to an object. Scribus also can manipulate type the way that illustration
or drawing programs like CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator do, by
converting fonts into PostScript curves or outlines, which can
be twisted, scaled, sheared and stretched at will. You also can fill
these with gradients or images and attach text to a path. Scribus also can
export SVG, including text and images. All images within SVG files
are converted to PNGs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7054f3.large.jpg"><img src="7054f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Advanced PDF export&mdash;Scribus can modify font outlines and create
sharp, high-resolution gradients with layers in the object and transparency as well. This kind of
output requires advanced
 Level 3 PostScript and PDF 1.4 operators, previously available only in
proprietary DTP applications. (This is a snapshot of Scribus 1.1.0.)
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cbd860"></a>
User Preferences</h2></div></div><p>
DTP users are accustomed to extensive keyboard
shortcuts, and Scribus is no
exception. Functions can be operated by user-defined keyboard shortcuts,
menu choices and considerable usage of right-click context menus. Font
paths can be added or disabled, along with font substitution preferences
on the fly. Caution is advised to ensure your fonts are
installed correctly with up-to-date fonts.dir and fonts.scale files. Scribus is
necessarily quite fussy about font paths and has a lot of code
to sniff out the exact capabilities of your installed fonts. A common
problem new users find with Scribus is they think that Scribus cannot
find fonts that have been installed. To the contrary, Scribus
rejects installed fonts that are not 100% in order.
The documentation contains an extensive explanation of this. Fonts are mini
programs in a sense and have bugs too.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cbd9c0"></a>
Text Handling</h2></div></div><p>
Scribus can import ASCII text files as well as clipboard text. This
is enhanced by the ability to specify the encoding of text. Thus, you
can place Unicode text, as well as text created in Cyrillic and Latin
encodings. You also can switch the direction of text to right-to-left
scripts like Arabic and Hebrew. Expect to see additional import filters
added in the next versions.
</p><p>
Special font handling features allow you to rotate, flip and
scale text. Scribus automatically can hyphenate text in many languages
and can allow you to adjust kerning or spacing between
letters in a font. If you add AFMs (ASCII font metrics) files for
a given font, Scribus uses this to adjust the spacing
between letters automatically. Scribus also supports Type 1 and TrueType
fonts equally.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7054f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Scribus has one of the easiest to use tools for creating text on
a path. This allows users to have text follow an irregular object and can
be used for styling text or, for
example, naming roads in a diagram.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cbdcd8"></a>
Image Handling</h2></div></div><p>
Scribus can import many common image formats, such as PNGs, TIFFs and
JPEGs. All images can be scaled within Scribus, rotated, flipped and
layered. If an image file has an ICC color profile embedded, Scribus
reads the tags and uses them in the littlecms color management.
You easily can import EPS files, as well as
the first page of a PDF. To make it easier for you to place EPSes
and PDFs, Scribus automatically generates a low-resolution preview. EPS
files do not have previews natively.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cbdde0"></a>
PDF and PostScript Exporting</h2></div></div><p>
Scribus has one of the best PDF export engines on
the planet&mdash;a
bold claim, but in my opinion, second only to the latest version of Adobe's
InDesign. The PDF exporter is not only easy to use, but generates
high-quality PDFs, as long as you use properly prepared
images and choose good quality fonts. Part of the genius in the PDF
exporter is the way it masks confusing options but does not
constrain the power of the user or the use of advanced
features, like
PDF/X-3. In testing, I used the same images and fonts to create large
high-resolution, four-color CMYK PDF from both Scribus and other high-end
DTP applications. The differences were indiscernible. Colors, fonts and text
rendered exactly the same, and the images were rendered with the same
fidelity throughout. It also fully supports PDF 1.4 features,
such as 128-bit encryption and transparency in the PDF. Scribus can
export high-quality EPS and raw PostScript files if needed as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cbdf40"></a>
Power of XML</h2></div></div><p>
Scribus documents and preference files are XML-based, completely open and
documented. This makes adding features much simpler, and their text-based
nature makes them robust. DTP file formats internally are some of
the most complex in the PC world. File corruption frequently can be a
problem, and DTP files can be unstable on less-than-perfect networks
as well. I have found the XML format in Scribus to be almost crash-proof. Even
with bleeding-edge CVS versions of Scribus, I rarely have lost a file, and
even broken ones can be fixed with a text editor. PageMaker and Quark
users have long been used to frequent saves and some novel tricks to
repair damaged documents.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cbe048"></a>
Scribus in the Commercial Print World</h2></div></div><p>
The design decision early in the launching of the Scribus Project to
concentrate on the PDF format was prescient. After many years of false starts, the
commercial print world is adopting PDF as the preferred method of file
exchange. [<i  >Linux Journal</i> sends pages to the printer as PDFs&mdash;Ed.] It is not uncommon for publications to require PDF files
from advertisers. Thus, some magazines are composed entirely of PDFs,
with the complete publication re-exported as a PDF. Why? PDF eliminates
a host of application and cross-platform incompatibilities, especially
with fonts. In addition, mature preflighting tools
now exist for verifying PDFs as being press-ready. The emergence of the PDF/X ISO
standards also has pushed PDF adoption.
</p><p>
That said, Scribus was not designed to be a &ldquo;Quark-killer&rdquo;. Scribus
is meant to give Linux and UNIX users comparable tools, which have
been, until now, the province of expensive proprietary applications, available only on Mac and Windows operating systems. DTP users
and shops can be rather conservative about upgrades and changing
applications. Reliability is critical&mdash;a missed print run can cost
thousands of dollars. Plus, these applications take months, sometimes
years to master. Productivity can suffer in the switch-over, even amongst
newer versions of the same application.
</p><p>
The support for PDF/X-3 in Scribus is another way to make Scribus
files accepted in the print world. The newest raster image processors (RIPs)
can support PDF/X-3, preserving the original RGB (red, green and blue) images
and ICC profiles until the last moment when the files are converted to
printing plates.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cbe2b0"></a>
Summing Up</h2></div></div><p>
As a personal aside, as a Linux newbie and nonprogrammer at the time,
volunteering to work on the documentation was one of the best experiences
I have had in computing. Coming from the Windows/Mac/Novell world, this
gave me a more sophisticated understanding of Linux/UNIX
methodologies. Many excellent open-source projects and developers
almost always can use help with documentation and testing. For
nonprogrammers, this
is a small repayment for the many programs we enjoy so freely.
</p><p>
The history of DTP on Linux is, well, brief. In 2000, Adobe
publicly beta tested a release of Framemaker that runs on some flavors of
UNIX. It then disappeared. For a short time, a company called Chilliware
offered a DTP application called Ice Sculptor. The company closed shortly
after the release. Although DTP is in some respects a niche application,
Scribus brings new reach to the Linux desktop.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cbe410"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Q &amp; A with Franz Schmid</b></p><p>
Q: Why did you begin Scribus?
</p><p>
A: I needed a program for Linux to make menus and
cards for my in-laws' small hotel in Bavaria, but
there was nothing for Linux like the DTP programs
that ran on my Mac. I originally wrote this only
for myself in Python, until a friend suggested
I put it on the Web. I was really surprised with
the response.
</p><p>
Q: How did you come up with the name Scribus?
</p><p>
A: I was thinking of calling it something like &ldquo;Open Page&rdquo;,
but it was not unique enough for me. Scribus comes from Latin for the
name of official writers in Rome, like we use the word scribes in
English. It makes sense in many languages.
</p><p>
Q: Why did you pick Qt?
</p><p>
A: When I decided to switch to C++, Qt was the only C++ kit with
full documentation. Scribus was and is my first C++ project. Python
is great for proof of concepts, but it was slow in some functions.
</p><p>
Q: Who is on the Scribus team?
</p><p>
A. Well, at the moment, it is me and Paul Johnson, who has been a member
since 0.8 of Scribus. He started the anoncvs, helped with code review
and does many other things like supporting users on the mailing list.
Peter Linnell joined earlier with testing and documentation.
Some valuable contributions have come from other users. Our
mailing list is quite active, and I have received some nice e-mails
from users who appreciate the quick responses. We have a group of
users who are really active on the mailing list, and this helps free
me to have time to code. We are probably not normal for open
source in that we all are in our 30s and 40s. We all have
regular jobs and families. But for DTP, especially, it helps to have
some experience and knowledge of the industry.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cbe8e0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>When to use TeX, when to use Scribus?</b></p><p>
For years, a large part of the UNIX/Linux world
has equated DTP with TeX and its derivatives&mdash;for
good reason, in the publication of long technical
documents, scientific, mathematic and other
text-heavy documents, TeX excels. TeX
can create press-ready files as well; entire
books have been created with TeX. However, although one can
add images and other artwork, TeX is neither
intuitive nor efficient for
composing highly graphically oriented documents. DTP is actually one of the
best uses of WYSIWYG. The methodology of TeX
is quite different from visual WYSIWYG DTPs. It's like
trying to describe a painting in HTML code&mdash;you can do it, but it is not easy. In
the Linux world, there is most certainly room and
a need for both.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cbeaf0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>The Secret Sauce of Color Management</b></p><p>
One of the advanced features of Scribus is the
option to use the littlecms color management
libraries. Released under the LGPL, littlecms
has become a refined and versatile package for a
number of color-related tasks. End users of the
profiling tools give it high marks for accuracy
and constant improvement.
</p><p>
Proprietary color management methods have been
a closely guarded secret until now. How does
littlecms accomplish this? First, there exist ISO
standards for color and color profile formats
that are open and published by the ICC at
 <a href="http://color.org" target="_self">color.org</a>. Second, to greatly simplify, conversions
are made with 3-D lookup tables to convert one color
space to another. The secret sauce is the
algorithms used by the color management module to
adjust the differences between color spaces. The
challenge is mapping from one type of color to the
other while minimizing the effects of gamut
compression. This is the result of the CMYK color
space typically having a smaller gamut, or
range, of colors that can be rendered by a given
device. For example, certain brilliant greens
can be created on an RGB monitor but are
difficult to render with CMYK colors on a printed
page. The thickness, brightness and ink adsorption
of the paper also affect printer gamuts. The latest
versions of littlecms have something called Black
Point Compensation, another trick in adjusting the
colors just so, matching as closely as possible the
screen and scanner to the final print destination.
</p><p>
Littlecms offers not only a cmm (color management
module), but additional utilities that
can assist with color-oriented tasks.
Some command-line tools allow for embedding or
tagging ICC profiles in image files,
but also a set of profiling tools can
be used to create ICC profiles for your monitor and
scanner. A good ICC profile of your monitor is
really the first necessity in setting up useful
color management in Scribus. My testing of the
littlecms monitor profile yields good results
for a visual profiler. In high-end DTP, profile
creation and calibration is done with special
equipment and software, which can run in the
thousands of dollars.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1bcd580.0x1cbee08"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Using The GIMP with Scribus</b></p><p>
One of the limitations of using The GIMP in the
pre-press and DTP world has been the lack of
CMYK support. Simply put, The GIMP works in RGB or grayscale. The printing
world uses CMYK&mdash;the four primary ink colors used in four-color printing. A reading of The GIMP mailing list
suggests this might be added to GIMP 2.0, as it has
been a long-standing request. Moreover, a lot of
discussion has surrounded patents
relating to CMYK color. To me, this is a lot of
nonsense. As Scribus and the littlecms libraries
show, CMYK colors themselves are not encumbered
by patents. As long as you do not use patented
processes, you are in the clear. Fortunately,
a couple of workarounds exist for using The GIMP
in the CMYK world: 1) Scribus itself automatically converts RGB colors
to CMYK, if the printing
options are set to printing in PDF export.
2) Alistair Robinson, who has contributed code to Scribus before, has
created a simple, but effective way to output CMYK TIFFs with The GIMP, by cleverly
separating the RGB layers and using the gray channel for the CMYK colors.
Separate is a GIMP plugin available here: <a href="http://www.blackfiveservices.co.uk/separate.shtml" target="_self">www.blackfiveservices.co.uk/separate.shtml</a>.
</p><p>
There are two other options for CMYK support in
Linux: Corel PhotoPaint 9 still is downloadable via
FTP. It is free, as in free beer, but unsupported and
difficult to install on newer distributions. Caldera
Graphics offers both a free &ldquo;light&rdquo; version and
a commercial version of Cameleo, which includes
scanning and image conversion tools. Both have

One frequent stumbling block for beginners is image
resolution. Typically, most images on the Web are
72&ndash;96 dpi (dots per inch). When creating DTP
files, much higher resolutions often are needed,
typically a minimum of 200 dpi or often 300 dpi. For
example, this magazine has an optimal resolution
of 266 dpi. I have output images in The GIMP as
high as 1,200 dpi with excellent results.

Peter Linnell is an IT consultant and principal of Atlantic Tech
Solutions in New England, specializing in networks, pre-press and DTP. A
self-described &ldquo;Windows refugee&rdquo;, the Scribus Project is the
first open-source project he has worked on. He is working studiously on gaining a
Red Hat Engineers' certification to complement his Microsoft and CompTIA
certifications. He eschews all claims to geek status, hopefully proven
by marrying a lovely French lady, preferring Bordeaux to Jolt cola and
traveling to Europe as much as possible.
