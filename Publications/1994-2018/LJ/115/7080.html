It's true, Fran&ccedil;ois, I feel exactly as you do. Although I realize
the theme of this issue is high-performance computing, when I think
<span   class="emphasis"><em>high performance</em></span>, I think <span   class="emphasis"><em>race
cars</em></span>. In a strange way, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>, the link is a powerful one. After all, what pushes the boundaries
of computing performance like great 3-D simulation? Think of
it&mdash;high-performance racing driving high-performance computing. One might
call that a delicious, perhaps intoxicating relationship,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?
</p><p>
Ah, just in time. Our guests have arrived, Fran&ccedil;ois. Welcome,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of fine Linux fare,
exceptional wines and edge-of-your-seat racing action. Please sit, and make
yourselves comfortable. I hope you enjoy the d&eacute;cor today. I had
Fran&ccedil;ois paint racing stripes on all the tables and chairs in honor of
this high-performance computing issue.
</p><p>
Fran&ccedil;ois! To the wine cellar, <span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>! We need something to
excite the senses. As I recall from my earlier quality-control
tour of the cellar, the 1999 Margaret River Chardonnay from Australia
is certainly exciting and has enough spirit to go the distance.
</p><p>
While we wait for Fran&ccedil;ois to return with the wine, I should tell you that
every item on tonight's menu requires an accelerated 3-D video card
and the appropriate XFree86 drivers, including the Mesa 3-D development
libraries for compiling. All the systems here in the restaurant are
ready, but if you need some information on setting up 3-D acceleration on
your home Linux system, see my <i  >Linux Journal</i> May 2003 article,
&ldquo;Battles inside the Computer&rdquo;, for some information on direct rendering
and testing your card's performance.
</p><p>
The first car racing simulation I remember wasn't on a computer. It was
a simple, electric slot car track. The action on the figure-eight strip
of black plastic was exciting. Although it was three dimensional&mdash;after
all, nothing is 3-D like reality, <span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?  &mdash;it was from an overhead
viewpoint, a kind of overhead 3-D. That's the spirit behind the first
item on tonight's menu, Harry Storbacka's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Race</em></span>.
</p><p>
To get <span   class="emphasis"><em>Race</em></span> up and running (or to get yourself up and running in
 <span   class="emphasis"><em>Race</em></span>), you can either download the static binary from the Web site
or build from source. Both are available from the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Race</em></span> Web site at <a href="http://race.sourceforge.net" target="_self">race.sourceforge.net</a>. Obviously, the easiest thing to
do is extract the binary package, but should you decide to build it from
source, make sure you have the clanlib, xml2 and ode development
libraries. After extracting the package, it simply should be a matter
of running <b  >make</b> as indicated below:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf race-0.9.0-src.tar.gz
cd race-0.9.0
make
./race
</pre>
</p><p>
The installation is less than graceful (at least for now). I found
that I had to play with the Makefile (specifically to deal with
the path to my xml2 libraries), so running the available static
binary certainly is much easier. Extract the source (<tt  >tar -xzvf
race-0.9.1-0-static-linux.tar.gz</tt>), change to the directory and run
<tt  >./race-0.9.1-static</tt>. The game starts by letting you choose a
few settings, including the track. You also can click Continue until
the race starts. As I mentioned, the view now is from above. If you are
slow on the old gas pedal, the other cars on the track will start pushing
on you. The action has a kind of twisted realism to it. As the tires
spin, smoke starts to rise from their tires. Press A (think accelerate)
to start moving. The cursor keys turn the wheels left and right.
</p><p>
After spinning out on the curves a few times, I was delighted to learn
that such small details were remembered in the game. When I came around
for my second lap, the skid marks still were on the road. It's a
cool effect.

</p></div></div><p>
The real thrill of racing starts when you get behind the wheel of
a car (even virtually), which explains the excitement and attraction of
sit-down racers at your favorite arcade. Out there in the Linux world,
you'll find a number of simulators of this type. Some are quite mature
and professional, but as with the real world, cars and engines are
always under development, pushing the envelope as they try to eke out a
few extra revs. So it is in the world of open-source development. I'll
show you a couple of these now.
</p><p>
One particularly promising entry is Alex Pozgaj's <span   class="emphasis"><em>T1 Car Racing
Simulation</em></span> (t1-crs). As of this writing, the game was listed
as alpha. It still was a lot of fun, though perhaps not totally
playable; nevertheless, it shows great promise. If you would like to
take it for a spin (in Alex's Toyata Supra), visit the <span   class="emphasis"><em>T1</em></span> Web site at
<a href="http://t1-crs.sourceforge.net" target="_self">t1-crs.sourceforge.net</a>. Armed with the source, follow
these steps:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf t1-crs-0.1.2a.tar.gz
cd t1-crs-0.1.2a
./configure
make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122e580.0x13271b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There's no install as of yet. To play the game, stay in the build
directory and type <tt  >src/t1_crs</tt>.
</p><p>
Cursor keys control left and right motion as well as the gas and brake
pedals. Make sure you gear up before starting or you may find yourself
going backward. The letters Q and A on your keyboard let you gear up
and down, which is absolutely necessary if you want to start moving.

The authors of the next item on tonight's menu, foobar and
judeo, call their creation <span   class="emphasis"><em>OpenGL Race Game</em></span>, but I'll call
it <span   class="emphasis"><em>Canyon Racer</em></span> to differentiate it from the other OpenGL race games
featured today. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Canyon Racer</em></span> is another game currently in development
that is nonetheless a lot of fun to play. With a hint of flavor
from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars</em></span>' pod racers, this game puts you on a futuristic,
floating vehicle careening along canyon walls. The action is fast and
a little wild as you try to stay inside those walls. Above and to the
left you'll find a partial map alerting you to upcoming turns. I must
confess, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I had enough trouble avoiding the
walls, never mind looking at the map.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7080f3.large.jpg"><img src="7080f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Futuristic <span  class="emphasis"><em>Canyon Racer</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>
For a copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Canyon Race</em></span>r, go to the Project Z Web site at
<a href="http://projectz.ath.cx/?id=70" target="_self">projectz.ath.cx/?id=70</a> and pick up the source. As with
basically all of these games, you do need a 3-D accelerated video card.
To build the game, you need the OpenGL and SDL (mixer and image)
libraries. With the necessary prerequisites in
place, the rest is easy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xjvf racer-0.5.tar.bz2
cd racer-0.5
make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x122e580.0x1327b58"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Because there is no install script, game play starts from the build
directory. Type <tt  >./race</tt>, and you are on your way.
Movement in the game is through the keyboard. The easiest thing
is to use the cursor keys, but there are letter equivalents as well.
Pressing W moves you forward; S is reverse, and A
and D are left and right. Pressing the spacebar puts on the brakes.
To play full screen, press the F1 key.
</p><p>
As mentioned, the developers consider this a game in its early stages
(anyone want to help them?), but it is fun. The game's development
nature shows up when you lose control and fly over a canyon wall
into the <span   class="emphasis"><em>non-world</em></span>.
</p><p>
My favorite race game (and the most advanced in this roundup), is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TORCS</em></span>. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>TORCS</em></span>' Project leader Eric Espi&eacute; and his team have put together a mature
and advanced race simulation with beautiful graphics, photo-realistic
scenery, real-time action and a lot of different cars (more than 40 at the
time of this writing). If you find yourself getting bored with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TORCS</em></span>,
perhaps it's time for you to get into the action.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TORCS</em></span> lets you program
your own cars, robot opponents and race tracks as well. This is a game for
the serious racer.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7080f4.large.jpg"><img src="7080f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Taking to the Open Road with <span  class="emphasis"><em>TORCS</em></span>
</p></div></div><p>
For a copy of <span   class="emphasis"><em>TORCS</em></span>, visit <a href="http://torcs.sourceforge.net" target="_self">torcs.sourceforge.net</a>. The site provides binary packages
for Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake, Debian and others, as well as source (the
software is GPL'd, after all). For those who really want to live on
the high-performance racing edge, CVS downloads also are provided.
</p><p>
Building from source is pretty standard stuff, but there are a number
of prerequisite libraries for 3-D development (namely Mesa and GLUT), as
well as plib. The easiest way is to download one of the binary packages.
Should you go that route, make sure you get everything you need. At the
very least, pick up the base TORCS and TORCS-data packages.
Although this is all you really need to get started, download and install
some TORCS-robots, TORCS-data-cars and the TORCS-data-tracks-base
packages as well. This gives you robot opponents to race against,
some seriously cool places to race and that wide selection of cars I
was telling you about.
</p><p>
You can start <span   class="emphasis"><em>TORCS</em></span> by typing <tt  >torcs</tt>. The first
thing you'll see is a simple screen offering a single-player race and
an option for setup. If you are impatient, head straight for a single-player race, but you will want to come back and tweak some of those
setup options. <span   class="emphasis"><em>TORCS</em></span> works with keyboard, mouse or
joystick access, and the setup lets you tune these choices. From the setup,
you also can
change your player name, choose a car or track, select the type
of transmission (manual or automatic) and so on. Even under the basic
race menu, you can make choices, such as what kind of car you want
to drive and where you want to race. I personally like being at
the wheel of that red Ferrari on the Alpine track.
</p><p>
The action is fast and guaranteed to make your heart race. Onscreen
displays show your position in the race, including current lap, as well as
the status of your opponents (you sometimes pass them sitting in the
ditch). It also has the standard speedometer, tachometer
and fuel gauges. The top right-hand corner shows a constant
frames-per-second readout, giving you an idea of your graphic card's
performance, a fascinating mirror to your virtual race car's performance
(my NVIDIA card ran about 75fps on average). The physics of the game are
great as well. As with the overhead race game I covered at the beginning,
too fast a turn sends you careening and leaving skid marks, and if
you find yourself on a slope without any forward acceleration, the car
starts to roll downhill.
</p><p>
Time has screamed by tonight, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and already I see
we are approaching the checkered flag and closing time. Still, there
is always time for a final glass of wine and a final race,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>non</em></span>?
Fran&ccedil;ois, if you would be so kind as to do the honors. Have another
sip of wine, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, then set down your glasses and get ready
to put the pedal to the metal.
Until next time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, let us all drink to one
another's health. <span   class="emphasis"><em>A v&ocirc;tre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
