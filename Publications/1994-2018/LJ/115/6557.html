Your new code may be secure, but what about the large project you
inherited? Use a tool to find and prioritize possible security
issues.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef4580.0x1fec240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The main focus of most writing about security is
network security and physical security. Not much
is written about writing secure programs.
A lot of what you need to write secure programs is common sense,
but due to time constraints and design shortcuts,
it is rarely used. Any good programmer knows the
concepts but usually does not have the time to
implement them; there is a lot of pressure to
produce a lot of code and get the project done.
</p><p>
In the early 1970s, the concept of structured
programming was alive. Not only was the
program structured but the whole
project had structure; there were technical
specifications, design specifications, detail
design specifications, design walk-throughs and
code walk-throughs. This made projects bigger
and longer, but when finished, the code was
debugged easily and often worked with few changes. Some of
these projects took many years to produce. However,
there was little external influence from networks,
the Web and time to market.
</p><p>
Today, a lot of the structured development process
has literally disappeared.
But security starts with the design of the program or
application and depends on coding standards
established by the organization where the
work is being done.
</p><p>
It
is very unlikely that any code will be
100% secure; no code ever is. But, what can be done to
make sure code is solid and secure?
This article offers some ideas on what to consider
and explains three tools to help write secure
code. When designing and implementing an embedded
system, more care is required for the coding. With
the assistance of the tools in the
Resources section, a lot of coding errors can be
checked. The ultimate judge of secure code is left
up to the implementer of the code and the ability
of the implementer to understand what is secure.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef4580.0x1fec450"></a>
Check for Errors</h2></div></div><p>
Every function returns some type of status,
returned either directly or as part of
errno. Checking these should be simple. In C++, the
exception-handling capability is easy to use but
can be complicated to set up. Exception handling
has improved greatly over the past few years, once
the C++ standard was finalized. When practical, it
should be used. Previous practice had been to
ignore errors, because it was thought the data being
passed was valid. This has been proven to be a bad
assumption.
</p><p>
Data buffer overflows have led to many
security fixes in the past years. When writing for
an embedded system, checking for error returns is
important. Decisions need to be made about whether the
error is benign and can be ignored. If the error
is not benign, maybe it can be corrected. If it
cannot be corrected, does the system perform a soft
reset or a hard reset? In some cases a soft reset,
causing the action in error to be restarted,
is all that is required. This is the basis for some
fault-tolerant systems. Depending on the type
of device, a hard reset may not be a bad thing.
Other times, some form of recovery is a must.

Looking for Strings</h2></div></div><p>
Instead of using sprintf, strcpy and strcat,
use functions like strncpy and strncat. These
functions make sure the buffer does not overflow and
discard any excess. Do not use fgets
when reading data, as this allows overflows.
These may seem like simple changes, but they are easy
to forget, as is string handling, one of the most
exploited areas of programs. Automated test
programs check for these problems quite nicely, but the
tests can be misleading. Some uses of the
string function may be flagged as a problem but
prove to be fine in the context where used. This is
where the ability and knowledge of the implementer
plays an important role. The logs generated by
the tools need to be scanned to determine what
code has been flagged and needs to be changed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef4580.0x1fec710"></a>
Memory Leaks and Buffer Overflows</h2></div></div><p>
Memory leaks in and of themselves do not
necessarily create security risks. However, they
can be exploited if
the memory is shared by several procedures and
structures.
</p><p>
Buffer overflows are by
far the most common security issue. If a buffer
is allocated on the stack, it can be overflowed
to wipe out or change the return address of a
function. When a function returns then, it returns to the new address
instead of to the proper address. Some buffer attacks also can occur
on the heap. These are more difficult to create, but they still can be done. Programs written in C are
most vulnerable to these attacks, but any
language that provides
low-level memory access and pointer arithmetic
can be problematic. Pointer arithmetic is one
area that should have bounds checking.
</p><p>
The GNU C
compiler has an extension available, which needs
to be included when the compiler is built, that
implements bounds checking. It is used as an option
that adds code to the program. During testing, the
code can be turned on and used. During deployment
the code would not be present. The reason the code
should be turned off is it prints messages
when the bounds are breached. If the system
in place is a workstation, the messages
can be left on, but an embedded system typically
has no console.
</p><p>
An idea that might occur here
is all the buffers should be statically
allocated; then the problem goes away. In truth, the
notion that a buffer is of fixed length can be
exploited. The data being moved to the buffer still
can be longer than the buffer. When it is moved it
overflows, and the same problem happens. To lower
the risk, the data movement should move up only
to the maximum allowed for the buffer. Dynamic
reallocation of strings permits programs to
handle inputs of arbitrary sizes. The problem
with this is the program could run out of
memory. On an embedded system, such a mistake is fatal. On a
workstation, the virtual memory system may start to
thrash and create a performance bottleneck.
In C++, the std::string class has the dynamic
growth approach. If the class' data is turned
into a char * pointer, a buffer overflow can
happen. Other string libraries may not have
these problems, but the implementer needs to be
aware of the limitations.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef4580.0x1fec978"></a>
Validate the Input</h2></div></div><p>
If a program is receiving data on which it must
operate, there should be some type of validation
that the data is correct, does not exceed the
maximum size and is free of non-valid types. For
instance, if the data is limited to uppercase
letters from A to Z, the function should reject
anything else. It also should check to make sure
the length of the data is valid. Many years ago,
everyone thought of data as 80 characters, the size
of a punch card. Today, data literally can be any
size; it can be text or binary or encrypted.
It still has some type of limit
though. This should be checked, and if it
fails, reject it.
</p><p>
Not only should you check for the maximum size of
a record or piece of data but, in some cases, check
for a minimum size. Strings should be checked
for legal values or legal patterns. If the data
being checked contains binary data that needs to be
kept that way, it may be better to use the common
escape character to signal that the data is binary.
If the data is numeric, range checking should
be done. If it is any positive integer, check if
it is less than zero. If there is a maximum value,
check for that. The file limits.h defines the
maximum and minimum values for most values, so it
is easy to check for system limits.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ef4580.0x1fecad8"></a>
Help Tools</h2></div></div><p>
The dilemma most developers get into is the code already exists,
and there is little time and manpower to spend checking for potential
security issues. After all, the code is not broken, so why fix it? This
attitude prevails in a lot of organizations. Once the code has been found
susceptible, however, fixing it becomes a high priority, as does assigning
blame.
</p><p>
What can be done to find
potential problems short of code inspection? I have learned of three tools
that are capable of finding potential problems and flagging them in a report.
These tools could be used on an embedded system, but most development is done
in a cross-hosted environment. Do the heavy work on the host workstation,
and leave
the fine-tuning to the target. The information on where to get the tools is
listed in the Resources section.
</p><p>
Flawfinder, RATS and ITS4 are three packages
that scan the source tree and display a report
about potential problems. The display is a
list of what is wrong, in which source module
and at what line. All of this information also is
weighted as to its degree of vulnerability.
Listing 1 shows a snippet from a Flawfinder execution on
the sample code. The severity level is from 0 to
5, with 0 being very little risk and 5 being high
risk.

Flawfinder version 1.21, (C) 2001-2002 David A. Wheeler.
Number of dangerous functions in C/C++ ruleset: 127

Examining ../../example_code/msgqueue/mksem.c
../../example_code/msg_queue/msgtool.c:73  [4] (buffer) strcpy:
  Does not check for buffer overflows when copying to destination.
  Consider using strncpy or strlcpy (warning, strncpy is easily
  misused).
../../example_code/msgqueue/mksem.c:34  [4] (shell) system:
  This causes a new program to execute and is difficult to use safely.
  Try using a library call that implements the same functionality if
  available.
../../example_code/pipes/fifo/fifo_out.c:28  [4] (race) access:
  This usually indicates a security flaw.  If an attacker can change
  anything along the path between the call to access() and the file's
  actual use (e.g., by moving files), the attacker can exploit the race
  condition. Set up the correct permissions (e.g., using setuid()) and
  try to open the file directly.
../../example_code/process_control/proc_mem_info/proc_mem_info.c:139
  [4] (buffer) sscanf:
  The scanf() family's %s operation, without a limit specification,
  permits buffer overflows. Specify a limit to %s, or use a different
  input function.
../../example_code/msg_queue/sender/snd_thread.c:70  [3] (random)
  srand:
  This function is not sufficiently random for security-related
  functions such as key and nonce creation. Use a more secure technique
  for acquiring random values.
../../example_code/dlopen/dltest.c:30  [2] (misc) fopen:
  Check when opening files - can an attacker redirect it (via
  symlinks), force the opening of special file type (e.g., device
  files), move things around to create a race condition, control its
  ancestors, or change its contents?
../../example_code/msg_queue/receiver/rcvr.c:51  [2] (buffer) char:
  Statically-sized arrays can be overflowed. Perform bounds checking,
  use functions that limit length, or ensure that the size is larger
  than the maximum possible length.
../../example_code/dlopen/another_dlopen_test/obj.c:15  [1] (buffer)
  strlen:
  Does not handle strings that are not \0-terminated (it could cause a
  crash if unprotected).

Number of hits = 139
Number of Lines Analyzed = 5491 in 2.67 seconds (2527 lines/second)
Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!

</pre></div><p>
Even though several messages are returned,
the implementers can choose to fix or ignore the
potential problems. Some developers might argue
that these tools should change the code, but it
is much better to change code selectively rather
than to make wholesale edits un-aided. The Flawfinder
program uses an internal database called a
ruleset. This ruleset is a list of the common
security flaws. These flaws are general issues
that can have an impact on C/C++ and a number of specific
problematic runtime functions.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Writing secure code can be easy. Thinking about
what is being written and how it can be exploited
has to be part of the design criteria. Testing
methods should be devised to check for various
types of attacks or misuse. Fully automating these
tests is a luxury that can go a long way to getting
a superior product to the consumer. The techniques
and tools discussed here are only helpers. The
development of secure programs still rests in the
hands and minds of the developers.
