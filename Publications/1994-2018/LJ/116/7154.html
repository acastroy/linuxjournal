distribution on his home computer. He's a part-time student and didn't
want a repeat of a situation from last semester: having rebooted his
system after it crashed, he discovered the document file he'd been
writing was corrupted. This wasn't the first time he'd
&ldquo;lost&rdquo; work, and he wanted to know if there was another OS option.
We switched him to the latest Red Hat, which uses the
journaling ext3 filesystem, and so far things
have run smoothly.
</p><p>I thought of my friend recently when reading Bruce Byfield's
Web article on &ldquo;Breaking the Word Processor Curve&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7120" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7120</a>). Bruce builds a good case
for OpenOffice.org's Writer being the best word processor around,
because it takes a completely different approach to style, structured
texts and long documents. Instead of using menus to access a limited
number of style options, OOo Writer &ldquo;offers a floating palette called
the Stylist. Repositionable anywhere on the screen, the Stylist not only
makes the application of styles more convenient, but it makes the
editing and creation of styles a single right-click away.&rdquo; In addition,
many features that don't work in Microsoft Word do work in OOo Writer, such as
master documents and automatic numbering. In this case, although my
friend was looking for an alternative, he may have ended up with the
better choice.
</p><p>If you're already familiar with Linux or other UNIX systems but
want some refresher articles, start with &ldquo;Using CFS, the Cryptographic
Filesystem&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6381" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6381</a>). Author Jerry Sweet
explains how CFS encrypts files in a directory and then lets you
decrypt them to plain text for a specified amount of time with a local
loopback NFS mount. When you're done, you check the files back in, and
they are once again encrypted. If you're interested in trying CFS,
Jerry's article also provides scripts and tips.
</p><p>
Two more good refresher articles are &ldquo;Overview of Linux Printing
Systems&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6729" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6729</a>) and &ldquo;Linkers
and Loaders&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6463" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6463</a>). The first article discusses the
basics of UNIX printing systems and how they revolve &ldquo;almost entirely
around the PostScript page description language&rdquo;. Author Stephane Peter
then shows how these basics apply to Linux and covers the BSD LPD
printing system, the LPRng printing system and CUPS. &ldquo;Linkers and
Loaders&rdquo;, on the other hand, is an overview of how compilers, linkers
and loaders work. Author Sandeep Grover explains three different types
of object files and the difference between working with static and shared
libraries. If you're looking to get into development or administration,
these two articles might be a good place to start your research.
