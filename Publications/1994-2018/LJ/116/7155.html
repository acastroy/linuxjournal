This special issue on entertainment puts you on the cutting edge
with great media apps and a 64-bit workstation you can build.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x218f580.0x2287298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Freedom and DVDs, unfortunately, make an explosive combination.
In the US, a judge cited the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright
Act (DMCA) in a decision banning our technology journalism colleagues
at <span   class="emphasis"><em>2600</em></span> from even linking to one DVD-descrambling program,
DeCSS.
</p><p>
In other countries, though, whether you can play DVDs on
your Linux box depends on whether you let your government impose a
DMCA-like law. Today, the UK Campaign for Digital Rights (<a href="http://ukcrd.org" target="_self">ukcrd.org</a>)
and other organizations are trying to prevent DMCA-like laws from taking
effect in Europe.
</p><p>
While the legal sniping continues, we're getting
more and better free, open-source DVD software for Linux. Dave Phillips
covers his favorite players and some DVD-playing tips on page 42.
Ian Pointer shows how to make your own DVDs with menus and
background music on page 50.
By the time DVD-playing software for Linux comes under attack outside
the US, it won't be merely a C program on a Web site. As Linux desktop
adoption continues to grow, DVD software for Linux will run on millions
of desktops that users take for granted.
</p><p>
And, those users are voters and jurors too. A California jury acquitted
Elcomsoft, a Russian software company that developed software to convert
proprietary &ldquo;e-books&rdquo; to open formats, of DMCA charges. That's not
surprising, considering that California jurors probably are used to
desktop applications and don't think selecting &ldquo;Save as...&rdquo; from the File
menu is a crime. Jury foreman Dennis Strader told the <span   class="emphasis"><em>San Jose Mercury
News</em></span>, &ldquo;Under the eBook formats, you have no rights at all, and the jury
had trouble with that concept.&rdquo;
</p><p>
It's hard to sell a product without a demo, and freedom needs a demo too.
So it's a race. Can freedom lovers deploy software that gives people
a chance to experience their digital rights before
governments take those rights away? Congress'
attempt to impose mandatory digital rights management in the US didn't go
anywhere, so the incredibly versatile effects builder Pure Data (page 60)
is safe for now, as is the jukebox at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>
(page 24). The more
people are used to doing something, the harder it would be to take away.
</p><p>
Gaining an ally in the struggle for freedom and justice&mdash;what better
reason to build someone a Linux system? When you read Glenn Stone's
article on page 36, build an Ultimate Linux Box for a family member
or friend, too. The Ultimate Linux Box gets to be more of a
bargain every year, even as we add 24/96 audio and move up to the 64-bit
AMD64 architecture.
Turn up the volume, put on some Oggs, break out the power screwdriver
and enjoy this issue.
