Managing Audio with Pd</h1></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Peter Todd</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #116, December 2003</div></div><div><p>
Ready to turn your Linux box into the
ultimate audio effects machine? With the Pd
environment, you can build reverb and more, visually.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b9190"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Pure Data (Pd) is a real-time visual programming environment for audio and
other multimedia applications. With it you can make patches that perform
operations on audio and visual data. These patches are represented
visually;
you &ldquo;draw&rdquo; where you want the signal data to go and what you want to happen to
it. This process is similar to how you program modular analog synthesizers.
The process
also is well suited to how you end up programming sound and video
applications; signals come in and go out, and you manipulate
various signals along the way. Due to space constraints, this article
covers only the more mature audio capabilities of Pd. If you later want to
try the video processing plugins, you should find that many of the concepts are
similar to those for audio.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b92f0"></a>
Messages and Audio Signals</h2></div></div><p>
Pd uses two main types of data, messages and audio signals. Messages
are sporadic, like MIDI note events. They can contain numbers or strings and
are used to pass around information, such as &ldquo;set the gain on the
output to <span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>&rdquo;.
Audio signals are constant; whenever the DSP code is turned on, audio is being
transferred. Internally in Pd, audio is represented by 32-bit floating-point
numbers. This means that unlike conventional analog or digital sound
processing, Pd signals can have nearly any amplitude you want. During
processing you can make a audio signal really quiet for one stage and amplify
it for another, with no loss in quality. Of course, when the signal is sent to a
hardware output, you must make sure it's within the usable range of
&ndash;1 to 1, or
the audio gets clipped.
</p><p>
These messages and audio signals are manipulated by various types of boxes,
described below. When put together, this collection of connected boxes is
called a patch.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20b9500"></a>
Boxes&mdash;Getting Some Work Done</h2></div></div><p>
Boxes do all the work. Pd has four main types of boxes: object,
message, GUI and comment. These boxes perform operations on messages and audio,
provide ways to give user input and document what's been done. Object boxes in
turn are divided into two types, control objects and tilde objects. Control
objects work with messages and therefore perform their functions
sporadically. Tilde objects work with audio data and perform their functions
constantly.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Message boxes send their contents to their output port when the user
clicks on them or when they receive a message on their input.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
GUI simply refers to boxes you can interact with, such as the number box
on the left.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
Finally, comments allow you to put text into a patch. They actually don't
affect anything.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Starting Pd and Making Your First Patch</h2></div></div><p>
Assuming you've compiled and installed Pd by now, you should try to start
it. First, make sure you've set the setuid bit on the Pd executable, and
make sure it's owned by root. Although this could be a security risk, you need
to do this to enable real-time scheduling if you want to run Pd as any user
other than root. If you don't and real-time scheduling isn't activated, you'll
hear a lot of clicks and pops whenever any other process, even the X server, tries
to do anything.
</p><p>
Run Pd with the -rt option and any other options you need in
your setup. I'd recommend using -verbose, because Pd itself is not overly
chatty and the verbose option does
provide some useful information. When that's done you should see a window
similar to the one shown in Figure 5. The IN and OUT boxes are peak meters for input
and output, respectively, and can be enabled by clicking the peak meters option.
If either clips, the respective CLIP box will go red. The DIO errors button
flashes if there are any synchronization errors in the input or output. Click
on it to see a list of recent errors. Finally, the compute audio check box turns audio
processing on or off.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The Main Window
</p></div></div><p>
First, let's create a new blank patch in which to work (File&rarr;New). From this we are going to
create a simple patch to print &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; to standard output.
So, we need a message box to hold the message &ldquo;Hello
World!&rdquo; and
an object box to do the printing. Both of these can be created from the Put
menu. You also can use the accelerator keys: Crtl-1 to place the object box
and Crtl-2 to place the message box. Once you've done that, to enter
the right text in the boxes, click on them and type. You also need to connect
the outlet port on the bottom of the message box to the inlet port on the top
of the object box. Your patch should look like the one shown in Figure 6. Get out of
edit mode by pressing Crtl-E. Now try clicking on the &ldquo;Hello
World!&rdquo; message
box; if all goes well, a message saying so is printed to the terminal in
which you started Pd.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f6.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1fc1580.0x20ba478"></a>
Using Messages</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's try a more complex example, making a
patch that adds two numbers together and displays the result. Make a patch
like the one shown in Figure 7, using two number boxes at the top, an object box in
the middle and a number box on the bottom. Next, exit edit mode (Crtl-E
again),
and try changing the numbers at the top. You can do this by clicking and
typing or clicking and dragging; move up to increase the number and move
down to decrease it.
As you've probably noticed, changing the number on the left makes the sum
immediately change, but changing the number on the right does nothing. Why?
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Adding Two Numbers
</p></div></div><p>
Nearly all objects in Pd treat their left-most inlet as hot, meaning that any
changes in their value affects an immediate change in the output. The
other inlets are cold. Changes in their values don't trigger any change in
the output. The new value simply is put into storage until a computation is triggered
by the hot inlet, at which point the new value is used.
</p><p>
But, what if you do want a change in a cold outlet to trigger a change in
output? One way to accomplish this is to inset a message box. In Figure 8, I connected
the outlet of the number box on the right to the inlet of a message box. The
outlet of that message box then is connected to the hot inlet of the addition
object box below it. When message boxes receive any message at all on their
inlets, they send all their contents as a new message on their outlets. So when
the right-most number box is changed, it sends a message to the bang
message box, which then sends a bang message to the addition object box.
Bang messages mean &ldquo;Do something!&rdquo;, so any object box
receiving one on its hot inlet immediately performs whatever computation
it's told to do.
We use this behavior here to make our addition object box act as though it has
two hot inlets.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. The Na&iuml;ve Way to Deal with Hot and Cold
</p></div></div><p>
But wait, doesn't that mean the bang message has to arrive after the number? If
it doesn't, the patch won't work, right? Well, yes; depending on
the order in which you made your connections, you already might have noticed that it
doesn't. Indeed, in Figure 8 the numbers don't add up precisely because of this
problem. So, we need a way to ensure that the bang message arrives after the number.
An easy way to do this is to insert a delay, as shown in Figure 9.
Interestingly, a delay of 0 actually works.
The message simply is delayed by one DSP cycle, thus
ensuring that the bang message arrives second.

Audio Processing</h2></div></div><p>
The most basic audio function is input and output. The adc~ tilde object,
standing for analog-to-digital converter, performs the first task; and the dac~
object, digital-to-analog converter, performs the second. Both objects operate
on the first two channels by default. If you want to change this&mdash;for
instance, if you have a multichannel sound card such as a Hammerfall
HDSP&mdash;you can enter
channel numbers as arguments, and the respective channels then are mapped to
their respective inlets or outlets. Figure 10 shows a simple example where stereo
input is flipped and routed to output. Because stereo input is the default,
the channel numbers in the example are redundant, but we've included them
anyway for demonstration purposes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f10.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. Flipping Left and Right in a Stereo Signal
</p></div></div><p>
Sound data is a sequence of numbers at a specific sample rate,
so it's possible to apply arithmetic operators to sound data. All you
have to do instead is add a tilde to the end of the operator you want to use. For
instance, Figure 11 turns a stereo signal into a mono one by adding the left and right
channels together. Another useful operator is multiply, *~, which acts as a
gain control. Remember, though, signals clip when output to hardware
if they are beyond the values &ndash;1 and 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f11.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. Turning Stereo into Mono
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 12 shows a more complex example. You might want to turn your speakers
down some before you run this one, because it's loud. First, the osc~
object at the top is a sine-wave generator, in this case running at
440Hz. This signal is split into two, the left side going directly to the
addition and the right side first going through a multiplication.
</p><p>
Now try entering &ndash;1 into the number box. The sound stops, why? If you remember your wave
physics from high school, you know that waves can cancel
one another out. In this case, the &ndash;1 creates a perfect inverse of the original
signal. So where the original is at 1, the inverse is at &ndash;1. When you add these
two signals together you get 0, silence. You also can try holding down the Shift
key and dragging on the number box; the numbers should change slowly enough that you
can hear the sound getting quieter as you approach &ndash;1 and then finally
stopping.

Making a Simple Reverb Filter</h2></div></div><p>
Let's put these components together and try to do something useful with
them;
let's make a simple reverb filter, using the above
techniques and one new one, the delay line. If you already have experience with
designing sound effects, you probably know what a delay line is; if not,
think of it as a buffer for sound. Sound that goes into a delay line inlet is
stored for a fixed period of time before it comes out again.
All sorts of complicated technologies have been used to implement delay
lines in the analog realm, some involving special springs and loops of tape.
Fortunately for us, we are dealing with digital signals where a delay line
can be implemented with nothing more than a FIFO (first in, first out) buffer.
</p><p>
Reverb is a natural phenomenon caused when a sound reflects off surfaces in
its environment. Due to increased distance, these reflections arrive slightly
after the initial sound is heard. These reflected sounds also are reflected
themselves. Most environments have some degree of reverb, and indeed a
carefully controlled level of reverb is a sought-after feature in concert
halls. A room without reverb is discomforting, because every sound you make
seems
like it's been snatched out of thin air.
</p><p>
The heart of this filter is the delay line. Figure 13 shows a delay line adding
a one second (1,000msec) delay to the sound input. Delay lines in Pd are
named,
meaning that to use one you need two separate objects, a writer and a
reader. The writer, delwrite~, takes two arguments: the first is the delay
line's name, and the second is the maximum delay you want to use in msec. You
can have only one writer per delay line. The second half is the reader,
delread~, which also takes two arguments: the name of the delay line and
amount of delay you want. Unlike the writer half, you can have as many readers
as you want, with any delay time you want. An
additional type of reader, the variable delay object (vd~), can change
its delay in response to an audio signal, but that's beyond the scope of
this article.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f13.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. A Delay Line
</p></div></div><p>
To recap, a reverb filter needs one straight signal path, the main signal, and
one or more delayed signal paths, the reverberations. The reverberations are
recursive, so some form of feedback needs to be in the system. Finally,
although our inputs and outputs are stereo, in the interest of space we
simply implement a mono reverb filter. For this, the incoming left and right need
to be mixed together and split at the other end. Figure 14 shows such a
filter. If we follow the signal patch from the inputs, the first thing you
should
notice is the *~ 1 object. This object is included to make the patch a bit cleaner. It
multiplies the signal by one, which is useless in itself, but it also gives us an inlet
to connect both the left and right channels and mix them into one. You can see a
similar structure at the bottom of the patch. The reverb signal then is sent to
another multiplier to attenuate the reverberation before it goes through
another reverb cycle. The delwrite~ and delread~ form a loop of reverberation.
Finally, the outlet of the multiplier is sent back to the dac~.

Adding MIDI Control</h2></div></div><p>
Make sure the MIDI device you want to use, preferably a
control device such as the Evolution UC-16, currently is working. An easy way
to verify that MIDI events are being received by Pd is to go to the Test Audio
and MIDI menu item in the Help menu on the upper-right corner of any window. Open
them and generate some MIDI events. If your controller is working and sending
out control messages, as opposed to note events, you should see the numbers under
the ctlin (control in) object at the bottom of the window change. You may need
to play with the -midi command-line argument to Pd to get this working;
also,
make sure you read the debug messages displayed as Pd starts up by using the
verbose option.
</p><p>
If all of this works, try out the patch shown in Figure 15. It's identical
to the reverb patch in Figure 14, except the reverb and delay now are controlled
from MIDI rather than from the GUI. This switch is achieved with the ctlin
object, which
takes one argument in this example, the controller number of the control you
want to use. The output is the raw value from the controller. Assuming you are
using a UC-16 or similar controller, this is a value from 0 to 127. The
other objects need to do a little math on this value to get it into the
desired range. In the case of reverb, the range we want is from 0 to 1,000, so we divide by 127 to get
a value from 0 to 1 and then multiply by 1,000 to get our final value. For
decay, a value of 0 to 1 is good, so we need only to divide.
Providing visual feedback on the values to which your effects are set is
good practice, so
this patch sends a copy of both reverb and decay to number boxes marked as
such.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7062f15.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 15. Using MIDI to Control a Patch
</p></div></div><p>
There you have it&mdash;a fully computerized, MIDI-controlled sound effect made
from only a few Pd objects connected together. This is only the
beginning of what's possible. Got a MIDI keyboard? You can use it as a control
device and make a patch that actually synthesizes the notes. Or, make a patch control
the MIDI keyboard. You even could make an entire reprogrammable effects
box. Furthermore, you
don't have to be content with the existing objects in Pd; you can write
your own in C or even in Pd itself. With Linux and Pd, the only limits are your
skills and the speed of your CPU.
