Traditionally, DVD authoring has been an expensive affair.
Full-featured professional applications can cost thousands of dollars,
while cheaper products, such as Apple's iDVD, have arbitrary restrictions
that significantly reduce their usefulness. A new open-source effort,
dvdauthor, is bringing the possibility of low-cost, professional-grade DVD
authoring to Linux. Although it doesn't yet support all the features of
the DVD specification, development is proceeding at a fast pace, and
new features are being added with each release. Together with a more
established open-source toolkit, mjpegtools, this article explains how
to construct a relatively complex DVD application, a photo album, with
dvdauthor.
We also illustrate the various features that dvdauthor currently supports
and how to use open-source tools to construct a DVD-R that can play on
almost every DVD player.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c9580.0x23c12f0"></a>
How a DVD Works (Quick Version)</h2></div></div><p>
A DVD is comprised of one or more video title sets (VTSes), which contain
video information in the form of MPEG-2 video streams. Each disc can
have up to 99 VTSes, and each title set can be subdivided further into as
many as 99 chapters, allowing DVD players to jump to a certain point
within the video stream. Within each VTS, a DVD can have up to eight
different audio tracks and 32 subtitle tracks that the viewer can
switch between at will. A menu system can be included within a title
set, allowing the viewer to select between the different subtitle and
audio tracks. An optional top-level menu, known as the video
manager menu (VMGM), is used to navigate between the different
title sets. One VTS may contain a feature film and another
may contain a documentary on the film, and the VMGM allows viewers to
select which one they want to watch.
</p><p>
The DVD format doesn't eliminate the differences between the two
competing broadcasting formats, NTSC (primarily used in America) and
PAL (the standard in Europe and Japan). I live in Britain, so the frame
information and resolution details used in this article are for a
PAL system, but I point out the differences you need to be
aware of when they appear and offer appropriate settings for an NTSC
disc.
</p><p>
The DVD specification includes advanced features, such as the concept of
region coding, the possibility of viewing different angles of a
video stream and simple computations using built-in registers provided
by a DVD player. I don't know much about these features, and they aren't
discussed in this article. The
dvdauthor mailing list is a good source for further information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c9580.0x23c14a8"></a>
Planning</h2></div></div><p>
Before we rush headlong into creating menus, subtitling
and multiplexing, it's a good idea to sketch out the structure of
the DVD with paper and pencil. Proprietary DVD tools offer GUI systems
for creating this type of structure, but no such
tools are available yet for DVD production on Linux. As you'll soon see, the command-line
tools have a lot of different options, so having your ideas on paper is
preferable to trying to keep everything in your head.
</p><p>
The DVD application I'm creating is a photo album, using pictures that
I took while studying abroad at UNC-Chapel Hill this past year. For
simplicity's sake, I have only six photos in each category. On
paper, I decide that the main menu (the VMGM unit) should have five
buttons, four of which are simple text buttons (one for each different
photo category), plus a secret link unlocking extra pictures (secret
extra features are a common occurrence in commercial DVDs) and a music
track playing in the background. The four regular buttons link to one
of four menus, one for each different section. The menu system for each
section consists of two menus and an audio track, with selectable
preview images of the slideshow, a button to move onto the next set of
preview images and two buttons that allow the viewer to watch
the complete slideshow or go back to the main menu. To keep things
simple, the photo slideshow should have the same song as the section menu
playing in the background. After the slideshow is finished, the
viewer is sent back to the section menu. The secret link is a
short slideshow with no menu, but it has two different music
tracks that the viewer can switch between while the video sequence is
playing.
</p><p>
To prevent things from getting mixed up, I created the directory
structure below to organize the files. The image directory
eventually will hold the completed DVD, while the raw photos go in the
photos/setN
directories and the video files go in the titleN or main directories:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dvd
	- title1
	- title2
	- title3
	- title4
	- title5
	- mainmenu
	- photos
		- set1
		- set2
		- set3
		- set4
		- set5
	- image
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c9580.0x23c16b8"></a>
Processing Pictures</h2></div></div><p>
In order to make the slideshows, we need to transform the pictures into
video clips. The mjpegtools suite includes a utility called jpeg2yuv
that transforms a JPEG file into YUV (a color model used for video
pictures) format, which then can be piped into mpeg2enc to generate an MPEG-2 video file. Before this transformation happens, though, we need to make sure
the picture files are formatted correctly for DVD. It is advisable
to alter your pictures manually to fit the PAL or NTSC resolution
constraints (720&times;576 and 720&times;480, respectively) before feeding them into
jpeg2yuv. mjpegtools includes a utility called yuvscaler that
automatically resizes incoming YUV data into the correct resolution, but
this can alter the aspect ratio of your pictures and cause distortion.
</p><p>
A sample command line to generate a slide looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
jpeg2yuv -n 125 -I p -f 25 -j picture1.jpg | \
mpeg2enc -f 8 -o slide.mpg
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c9580.0x23c1870"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The -n option tells jpeg2yuv how many frames it should generate, in
this case 125 (5 seconds at 25fps); you should use 29.97 for NTSC.
The -I option tells it to use progressive interlace (rather than
throwing parts of the image away), and -f sets the required frame rate.
The -f option to mpeg2enc tells it to create a DVD MPEG-2 video stream.
This process needs to be repeated for all the photos to be
included on the DVD, so you might want to write a quick Perl or shell
script to automate this process.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c9580.0x23c1978"></a>
Adding Music</h2></div></div><p>
Now we have video clips of separate slides. The next step is to add a
music backing track that plays across each clip. The DVD specification
allows for the use of PCM, AC-3 or MPEG-2 audio, at various
bit rates. For the photo album, I decided to use MPEG-2 audio; I decided that
I didn't need the higher audio quality of AC-3 or PCM.
mjpegtools includes a tool called mp2enc that encodes WAV files
in MPEG-2 format. Another tool from mjpegtools, mplex,
multiplexes one or more audio files into a video MPEG stream. To do
multiple audio files, you need the CVS version of mjpegtools.
Start by concatenating all the video files required for a particular
slideshow using <b  >cat</b>, as mplex seems to have problems with handling
multiple input files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cat *mpg &gt; video.mpg
</pre>
</p><p>
In the title5 directory (the fifth title is going to have two audio
tracks), I ran mplex on this new file:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mplex -f 8 -o video%d.mpg photos/set5/video.mpg \
audio1.mp2 audio2.mp2
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates a series of files called video1.mpg, video2.mpg, ...,
videoN.mpg in the current directory, multiplexed with the two audio
tracks, audio1.mp2 and audio2.mp2. The -f 8 argument to mplex ensures
that the new MPEG files are DVD-compatible, the same as mpeg2enc.
</p><p>
One issue to be aware of is that mplex multiplexes the whole audio
track. If the track is longer than the combined length of the video
clips, then the final clip is extended to cover the rest of the audio.
You may want to adjust the frame times in jpeg2enc phase or edit the
audio track to prevent this from happening.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c9580.0x23c1c90"></a>
Making Menus</h2></div></div><p>
The process for creating DVD menus is similar to generating the slides.
Using The GIMP, make a new image of size 720&times;576 (for PAL), with a
resolution of 75dpi in the x-axis and 80 in the y-axis (NTSC values
are 81 and 72). Add an alpha channel, then create the menu picture you
desire (see Figure 1 for the base image of the main menu). Once this is
finished, add another layer and mark out the location of the buttons
that can be highlighted, as seen in Figure 2. A maximum of four colors
can be used for this mask; I used red to mark the button areas, and
white to make sure that the text still was visible when a button was
selected. When you're satisfied with the menu, export the background
layer as a JPEG file and the mask as an indexed PNG. Make sure
you've set the number of colors to four, three if you're saving the
transparent background as a color. This process is repeated for all
menus required in the DVD (see Figures 3 and 4 for a further example).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6953f1.large.jpg"><img src="6953f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 4. The Mask for the Submenu
</p></div></div><p>
As before, use jpeg2yuv and mpeg2enc to create an MPEG file, and mplex
to multiplex it with an audio file. For some reason, menus need an
audio file to work, so if you want silent menus, you have to use a
short burst of silence. Buttons in DVD are implemented as part of the
subtitle stream, so we use dvdauthor's submux tool to define a menu's
buttons. The program reads in subtitle information from a text file and
multiplexes it into the video stream. The format of the submux files
looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;file_name&gt; &lt;start_time&gt; &lt;end_time&gt; &lt;x_offset&gt; \
&lt;y_offset&gt; &lt;4 8-bit numbers&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
There can be multiple entries in a .sub file, but only one line is required
for the menus:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mainmask.png 00:00:00.00 00:00:00.00 0 0 0 1 0 1
</pre>
</p><p>
Defining the start and end times as zero instructs the DVD player to
keep the subtitle on screen continuously. The 0 1 0 1 sequence
turns the selected button red when using the default palette file
supplied with dvdauthor. The four different numbers (from 0&ndash;255)
control the transparency values of the colors in the indexed PNG. You
might want to experiment with these values to see what effects you can
create, but the sequence above seems to produce reasonable results.
Having made a subtitle file, we then run submux to add the subtitles to
the video stream:

<pre     class="programlisting">

submux menu.sub &lt; video.mpg &gt; menu.mpg

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c9580.0x23c2688"></a>
Subtitles</h2></div></div><p>
As previously mentioned, a DVD can have up to 32 different subtitle
streams in a VTS. Although they're called subtitle streams,
they actually are implemented as overlaid picture files rather than as a text
representation, so they can do other things as well. An example of this is the &ldquo;White Rabbit&rdquo;
feature seen on <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Matrix</em></span> DVD.
Subtitling is fairly easy, as it's essentially the same process as creating
menus, only without the background layer. Figure 5 shows an example
subtitle picture, providing a title for a photo. A sample submux
description for this title that keeps it onscreen for two seconds would
be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sub1.png 00:00:00.00 00:00:02.00 0 0 0 255 0 255
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6953f5.large.jpg"><img src="6953f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. A Subtitle Image
</p></div></div><p>
In this application, I'm working with separate, short MPEG-2 clips, so
each has to have a separate submux description. For longer clips, a
submux file probably would have multiple entries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c9580.0x23c2aa8"></a>
Putting It All Together</h2></div></div><p>
Having made the video slides, subtitling them and creating the menus,
the only thing left to do is assemble everything
together using dvdauthor. dvdauthor works in two modes, one for normal titles and
another to define the VMGM menu; the VMGM can't have any video
information apart from the menu. Let's start with the first title:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dvdauthor -o tmp -m -P \
-b 239x397-489x457,subtitle32+vts1 \
-b 239x500-489x560,vmgm1 \
-b 27x223-127x263,subtitle32+vtsm.2 \
-b 165x184-325x305,subtitle32+vts1.1 \
-b 352x184-512x305,subtitle32+vts1.2 \
-b 539x184-699x305,subtitle32+vts1.3 \
\
title2/titlemenu1.mpg -m -P \
-b 239x397-489x457,subtitle32+vts1 \
-b 239x500-489x560,subtitle32+vmgm1 \
-b 27x223-127x263,subtitle32+vtsm.1 \
-b 165x184-325x305,subtitle32+vts1.4 \
-b 352x184-512x305,subtitle32+vts1.5 \
-b 539x184-699x305,subtitle32+vts1.6
\
title2/titlemenu2.mpg -t -P \
\
title2/v1.mpg title2/v2.mpg title2/v3.mpg \
title2/v4.mpg title2/v5.mpg title2/v6.mpg \
 -i post=3Dvtsm
</pre>
</p><p>
This code defines two title menus with six buttons each, six MPEG video
clips (dvdauthor defines the transition from one clip to another as
a chapter point) and a post-video instruction that returns the DVD
player to the title menu. The coordinate system is the same as The
GIMP's, so you can use that to get the necessary regions. A button can
perform various actions (see <tt  >dvdauthor --help</tt> for a
list of possibilities).
In the example above, the first button sets the audio track to zero,
sets up the required subtitle stream (stream 0 is bizarrely numbered
32, stream 1 is 33 and so on) and plays the video associated with the
title. The second button returns the player to the main VMGM menu, and
the third button moves the DVD player to the second title menu. The
other three buttons move to specific chapters within the video stream,
corresponding to clicking on one of the thumbnail pictures. The -o
option is for an output directory, in this case the image/
subdirectory. The program works incrementally, so running the same
command line twice creates an additional title set rather than
updating the original.
</p><p>
For the main menu, you need to pass the -T option to dvdauthor so
it knows it should create the required VMGM information. Then, link
in the VTS files it already has created:


<pre     class="programlisting">
dvdauthor -o tmp -T -m \
-b 497x89-693x136,vtsm1 \
-b 497x138-693x187,vtsm2 \
-b 497x189-693x239,vtsm3 \
-b 497x240-693x289,vtsm4 \
-b 426x405-490x474,vts5 \
-P mainmenu/mainmenu.mpg
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c9580.0x23b95f8"></a>
Testing and Burning</h2></div></div><p>
It's a good idea to test the DVD image before burning it onto disc.
This can be done using xine; all you need is to give xine an argument
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xine dvd:/path_to_dvd_root/VIDEO_TS/
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22c9580.0x23b9758"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and xine should act as though it is playing the information from a DVD. As
dvdauthor is incremental, you should be able to use xine after creating
each separate title to ensure that you're doing things properly.
</p><p>
Once you're happy with your DVD, it's time to burn. I used the
cdrecord-prodvd application for DVD-R burning. The operation is the
same as cdrecord, so first you need to create an ISO image using
mkisofs:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mkisofs -o &lt;output_filename&gt; -dvd-video \
&lt;path_to_dvd_root&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Then use cdrecord.prodvd to burn it:

<pre     class="programlisting">

cdrecord.prodvd dev=3D0,0,0 -pad -dao \
&lt;path_to_DVD_image&gt;

</pre>

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Although dvdauthor doesn't have the easy-to-use interface of professional
applications, it provides all you need to make DVDs to the same
standards as Hollywood uses, merely for the price of DVD-R media. Hopefully,
this article has shown you the basics of DVD authoring and provided
you with some ideas for your own applications. Get creating!
