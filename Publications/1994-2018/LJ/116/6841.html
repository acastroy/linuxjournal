Add your own functionality to MySQL
with MyPerl, which brings the powerful, versatile
Perl interpreter into the heart of the relational
database.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7d580.0x1c75298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Despite the fact that MySQL comes with a rich set of functions, at some
point you will find yourself wishing for some additional function or
needing an advanced regular expression engine. To
solve this problem, MySQL supports user-defined functions (UDFs). Through
the UDF interface, you can load
new functions into your database dynamically. Although this is a powerful
feature, it does
mean time spent debugging C or C++ code. As much as I like C, sometimes I
don't have the time to write and debug applications written
in it, and at other times I want a much faster development cycle. Enter
Perl, the Swiss Army knife of languages, with a cast of thousands thanks
to the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network
(CPAN). Embedding Perl into MySQL gave me a lot of flexibility in being
able to extend my database quickly. For these reasons, the embedded MySQL
Perl interpreter, MyPerl, was written.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7d580.0x1c753a0"></a>
Setting Up Perl</h2></div></div><p>
The first step in putting Perl into the database is to get the right
setup for Perl. Perl by default is not threadsafe, and MySQL, on the
other hand, uses a thread for each user connection. So for Perl to live
inside the database, you must compile a threadsafe version of Perl:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./Configure -Dusethreads -Duseithreads
</pre>
</p><p>
Once this is finished and built, you will have a Perl that is threadsafe.
This does not mean your code or any Perl modules
you use will be threadsafe, it simply means that Perl itself will
be. Building Perl to be threadsafe is a necessary step, because I know
of no vendors shipping a threadsafe Perl at this time. Don't
be fooled by the fact that MyPerl will build with a nonthreaded Perl;
it can, but at some point it will crash your database. I suspect that
with the advent of Apache 2.0 and a final release of mod_perl 2, some
vendors will consider shipping their Perl binaries with threads enabled.
While completing this article, I finally upgraded to Red Hat 9 and saw that
they have begun shipping Perl with threads enabled.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7d580.0x1c755b0"></a>
Writing the Embedded Perl Interpreter</h2></div></div><p>
UDFs have three stages: init, request and deinit. The init stage is
called once at the beginning of a query; the request stage is called
once per row returned, and the deinit stage is called after the data
is sent to the client. Both the init and deinit stages can be skipped,
although for all but the most simple UDF you need to
create and clean up memory you will use to return data to the client.
</p><p>
MyPerl starts off with the following init function:

<pre     class="programlisting">

my_bool
myperl_init(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
            char *message)
{
    myperl_passable *pass = NULL;
    int exitstatus = 0;
    char *embedding[] = { "perl",
                          "-MMyPerl::Request",
                          "-e", "1" };
    PerlInterpreter *my_perl;
    uint i =0;
    initid-&gt;max_length = 256;
    initid-&gt;maybe_null=1;

</pre>
</p><p>
Three parameters are passed into the init method, and it returns
either success or failure. The UDF_INIT structure holds information
that controls the behavior of how UDF responds. It also is the only
structure that is passed between all three stages. First,
MySQL is told the UDF will be sending data
back that is greater than the size of a VARCHAR. By telling the server
it needs more space then a VARCHAR, the server assumes it
will be returning blobs.
</p><p>
Although MyPerl does not know that it actually will be doing this, at this
point it has
no way of knowing how much data it will be returning, so
telling the server that it is returning blobs is the safer bet. Next, it
sets maybe_null to 1, because there is always the possibility it will
be returning NULL values. MyPerl returns NULL for both empty results
and upon compilation errors that occur from code that you eval().
</p><p>
The next thing is to check the rows being passed in:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if (args-&gt;arg_count == 0 || i
    args-&gt;arg_type[0] != STRING_RESULT) {
    strncpy(message,USAGE, MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE);
    return 1;
}
for (i=0 ; i &lt; args-&gt;arg_count; i++)
        args-&gt;arg_type[i]=STRING_RESULT;

</pre>
</p><p>
MyPerl expects that the first row being passed in is the code it
will execute. Therefore, if no rows are passed in or if the first row
is not a string, an error should occur. Error messages must be at most
the size of MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE, and they must be copied into the message
string. To save some time, MyPerl walks through the arguments that MySQL
will be passing in and tells it to convert them to strings.
</p><p>
Before the Perl interpreter is set up, a structure must be created to
store the interpreter and track a memory block that it will use to
return data for each request:

<pre     class="programlisting">

pass = (myperl_passable *)
    malloc(sizeof(myperl_passable));;
if (!pass) {
    strncpy(message, "Could not allocate memory",
            MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE);
    return 1;
}

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7d580.0x1c759d0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The structure is as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">

typedef struct {
    char *returnable;
    size_t  size;
    PerlInterpreter *myperl;
    size_t  messagesize;
} myperl_passable;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7d580.0x1c75b30"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The char pointer returnable is used to store the block of memory, and size
and messagesize are used to track both the total size and
the current size of the returnable data. Because creating and destroying
memory is quite costly, it is important to keep this down to a minimum. The
Perl interpreter also will be stored in this structure.
</p><p>
At this point, the work of setting up the Perl interpreter that will be
used for the query must be done. Currently, MyPerl creates a new Perl
interpreter for each request to keep from leaking memory and ensure
the security of data between requests. The odds of this becoming a pool
of Perl interpreters in the future is quite high:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if((my_perl = perl_alloc()) == NULL) {
    strncpy(message, "Could not allocate perl",
            MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE);
    return 1;
}
perl_construct(my_perl);
exitstatus = perl_parse(my_perl, xs_init, 4,
                        embedding, environ);
PL_exit_flags |= PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END;
if (exitstatus) {
    strncpy(message, "Error in creating perl parser",
            MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE);
    goto error;
}
exitstatus = perl_run(my_perl);
if (exitstatus) {
    strncpy(message, "Error in parsing your perl",
            MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE);
    goto error;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The first function, perl_alloc(), allocates a new Perl
interpreter that is then constructed with perl_construct().
Now it is simply a matter of starting up Perl. The embedding variable
is used as parameters for the Perl interpreter. These are exactly the
same parameters you would use on the command line.
Errors must be checked for at every point in dealing with the Perl
interpreter. In
the current design, if an error occurs, MyPerl jumps to a collection of
function calls that will clean up the memory that has been allocated.
</p><p>
Now that a good Perl interpreter exists, a few defaults in the
pass structure need to be set; the interpreter must be stored, and the
address of the structure must be stored in initid-&gt;ptr pointer so
it can be used throughout the query:

<pre     class="programlisting">

pass-&gt;returnable = NULL;
pass-&gt;size = 0;
pass-&gt;messagesize = 0;
pass-&gt;myperl = my_perl;
initid-&gt;ptr = (char*)pass;
return 0;

</pre>
</p><p>
After all of this setup, MyPerl is ready to start taking requests:

<pre     class="programlisting">

char *
myperl(UDF_INIT *initid, UDF_ARGS *args,
       char *result, unsigned long *length,
       char *is_null, char *error)
{
    myperl_passable *pass =
        (myperl_passable *)initid-&gt;ptr ;
    char *returnable = NULL;
    unsigned long x = 0;
    size_t size = 0;
    char *newspot = NULL;
    char *string = NULL;
    myperl_passable *pass =
        (myperl_passable *)initid-&gt;ptr ;
    STRLEN n_a; //Return strings length
    PerlInterpreter *my_perl = pass-&gt;myperl;

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7d580.0x1c75ea0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
It is important that the address of the interpreter is copied
into a variable named my_perl. Much of the Perl internals are based on
macros that expect you to use variables with certain names. STRLEN is
a variable type that Perl uses to store the size of strings.
</p><p>
At this point the interpreter is called:

<pre     class="programlisting">

dSP;
ENTER;
SAVETMPS;
PUSHMARK(SP);
// Now we push the additional values into ARGV
for(x = 0; x &lt; args-&gt;arg_count  ; x++) {
    XPUSHs(sv_2mortal(newSVpvn(args-&gt;args[x],
           args-&gt;lengths[x])));
}
PUTBACK;
call_pv("MyPerl::Request::handler", G_SCALAR);
SPAGAIN;
string = POPpx;
size = (size_t)n_a;

</pre>
</p><p>
XPUSHs is used to push all of the rows into an array of strings
that will be passed to the Perl function handler() in the library
MyPerl::Request(). This Perl module is similar to the Apache::Request
module except where the Apache module uses a filename to track code
it has eval'ed, MyPerl uses the code itself to determine this.
</p><p>
Because the variable named size now holds the size of the data that will
be returned, space needs to be allocated for it:

<pre     class="programlisting">

if (size) {
    if(pass-&gt;size &lt; size) {
        newspot = (char *)realloc(pass-&gt;returnable,
                                  size);
        if(!newspot) {
            error[0] = '1';
            returnable =  NULL;
            goto error;
        }
        pass-&gt;size = size;
        pass-&gt;returnable = newspot;
    }
    // Always know the current size,
    // it may be less than the full size
    pass-&gt;messagesize = size;
    memcpy(pass-&gt;returnable, string, size);
} else {
    is_null[0] = '1';
}

error:
PUTBACK;
FREETMPS;
LEAVE;
*length = pass-&gt;messagesize;

return pass-&gt;returnable;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
This is where the information that needs to be sent to the server is
stored. The memory call realloc() is used if more memory needs to be
allocated. If no data is received from the Perl interpreter, is_null is set
to 1 so that MySQL knows a null result
should be returned to the client. MyPerl also makes sure to clean up
memory that might have been used for the call_pv() function.
</p><p>
The myperl() function is now called for each row. After MySQL
returns its data to the client, it calls the deinit function to
free the interpreter and release any allocated memory:

<pre     class="programlisting">

void myperl_deinit(UDF_INIT *initid)
{
    myperl_passable *pass =
        (myperl_passable *)initid-&gt;ptr ;
    perl_destruct(pass-&gt;myperl);
    perl_free(pass-&gt;myperl);
    free(pass-&gt;returnable);
    free(initid-&gt;ptr);
}

</pre>

Examples Using MyPerl</h2></div></div><p>
Now that a Perl UDF exists, simple tricks like this can be performed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; select myperl('return $ARGV[0]',User)
       from mysql.user;
</pre>
</p><p> As you can see, each row corresponds with
a value in @ARGV. You also can use MyPerl with
CPAN modules to enter data directly. This example
fetches the content for a list of URLs and inserts
the content into the database:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mysql&gt; insert into html select
       myperl("use LWP::Simple;
       my $content = get($ARGV[0]);
       return $content", url) from urls;
</pre>
</p><p>
Using modules like XML::Simple and XML::XPath, you can even query any XML
you may have stored in your database. I have used MyPerl
for quickly debugging serialized Perl objects I have stored
in the database.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7d580.0x1c76528"></a>
But What about GROUP BY?</h2></div></div><p>
Although the above demonstrates how to handle row requests with this code,
it does not work for queries that use GROUP BY to treat data as sets. For
this reason, there is an additional type of UDF called an aggregate.
Aggregates
differ from their more bland cousins by having two additional stages,
reset and add. With aggregate UDFs, the add function handles each row,
and the request stage sorts out the results and sends the data on to
the client. The reset stage is called at the beginning of each data set,
so it is guaranteed to be called at least once. MyPerl currently has an
aggregate UDF, but its design is still in flux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b7d580.0x1c76630"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
By embedding Perl into MySQL, the realm of possibilities as to what you
can do in your database has expanded. Although frequently it is better
to keep your database as simple as possible, you may find in some
cases this is not practical. Imagine having to pull a gigabyte of
text out of the database and send it to a client to be used. The time
spent on sending the data would be considerable; being able to do work on
the data directly in the database with Perl may turn out to be a real time-saver. Being able to make use of Perl advanced regular
expressions may allow you to write simple clients in other languages
that do not have a good regular expression support. I am sure
you will find many uses for this in your own environments.

UDFs you can use as examples to write your own.
