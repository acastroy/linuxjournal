Our chef prepares a tasty selection of featureful jukebox software.
<span   class="foreignphrase"><i>A chacun son got</i></span>&mdash;try them all.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf99580.0x10913a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
What do you mean, you've never heard this song, Fran&ccedil;ois? This is
classic Steppenwolf, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. Bo-rn to be wi-i-ild! What's that?
You think I should keep my singing to the shower? I think, Fran&ccedil;ois,
that you are forgetting who the Chef and owner of this restaurant is.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Non, mon ami</em></span>, that was purely informational, and I already
have chosen to ignore that subtle dig. Look here, though. Each of these
programs allows us to provide customized playlists of our favorite
music for our guests.
</p><p>
Speaking of our guests, they are here. Welcome, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, home of fine Linux fare, exceptional wines and the
finest in musical entertainment. Entertainment is, after all, the theme
of this issue. Why musical entertainment, you ask? In a much earlier
part of my life, I used to make some extra money babysitting some
of my parents' friends' children. One of their friends repaired jukeboxes for a
living. Consequently, a real honest-to-goodness jukebox was always
in the house, full of 45 RPM singles. From time to time, the model
and type of machine would change, but with the coin mechanism disabled,
I had all the music I wanted available. Now, that's entertainment!
</p><p>
Like a lot of readers out there, I keep a lot of songs on my disk in
Ogg Vorbis or MP3 format. This makes sense because although I have a large
CD collection, popping CDs into my notebook means carrying the things
around, and that's not convenient. So I rip songs from all those
CDs I've bought and store them in the tiniest space possible, namely
my notebook. The CDs in jewel cases disappear into that virtual space
that is my disk, but the system still is far from perfect. Now I have all these
songs in a number of large folders with little or no organization.
If I want to play something, I have to go searching. Well, no more,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>! On today's menu, I offer you some
great open-source jukebox programs. With any of these on your Linux
system, your song collections can become well organized, searchable
and fun to use&mdash;just like the machines of my youth,
only much more compact.
</p><p>
Fran&ccedil;ois! What are you still doing here? To the wine cellar,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>imm&eacute;diatement</em></span>! I think we need something light
today&mdash;something
fresh and exciting. The 2001 Riesling Auslese Gold Cap Mosel-Saar-Ruwer
Wehlener from Germany certainly qualifies as stellar entertainment for
that most important of the senses, taste. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois!
</p><p>
While Fran&ccedil;ois brings back the wine, let's start our tour of jukebox
programs available for your Linux system. If you are a KDE desktop
user (and even if you are not), you should consider having a look at
Scott Wheeler's <b  >JuK</b> (Figure 1). In terms of pronunciation, think
jukebox and you have the idea. This program, being a KDE application,
integrates nicely into the KDE desktop, with a tray icon to
drop the application out of sight quickly. It includes support for your MP3
and Ogg Vorbis files, collection and playlist management, tag editing
and much more.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7139f1.large.jpg"><img src="7139f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. JuK is slated to be part
of KDE 3.2.
</p></div></div><p>
JuK will be released as part of KDE 3.2 and should be
part of any future KDE installation. In the
meantime, you can get your copy from the JuK Web site at <a href="http://www.slackorama.net/cgi-bin/content.pl?juk" target="_self">www.slackorama.net/cgi-bin/content.pl?juk</a>. Building Juk
is a simple matter of using the old extract and build five-step:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf juk-1.95.tar.gz
cd juk-1.95
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
When JuK starts up (with the command <tt  >juk</tt>), you find yourself
looking at a simple two-pane interface with a sidebar on the left-hand
side and a large work/display window on the right, both of which you can
size to suit. The expected menu and quick access icons are along the top.
The sidebar has a single folder icon labeled Collection List.
Adding songs to your JuK box is as simple as clicking the open folder
icon, pointing to a folder and selecting the songs you want. Click OK
and your songs appear in the default collection list. Because organization
is key, you can create additional playlists, then drag and drop titles
into your folder of choice. The titles appear in your new playlist but
remain in the master collection as well.
</p><p>
From the main track list window, you can click each of the columns
to sort by album title, artist, date or other catalog identifier.
As anyone with a collection of songs on their computer knows, the
information contained in the information tags isn't always perfect.
To deal with this problem, we have JuK's power tag editor.
What I really like about this feature is you can edit information in-line
by right-clicking on a song title, as well as by bringing up the more
comprehensive tag editor. Let's say you have 12 songs from a single
album and you'd like to enter the date for that album, JuK's editor
lets you select multiple titles and do mass changes to selected fields.
This is extremely handy and a great time-saver.
</p><p>
On the GNOME side of things, allow me to introduce you to
Colin Walters' <b  >Rhythmbox</b> (Figure 2). Rhythmbox is
another slick-looking jukebox program. You can search for songs, sort by a variety
of fields, create playlists and so on. The music library browser
views can be configured for two or three columns listing artist, genre
or album title. Click on any of the choices, and Rhythmbox narrows down
your choices. There's a tag editor for your collection
but no in-line edit feature (at least, not at the time of this writing).
It even has built-in support for Internet Radio; with a tuner card,
you can set your favorite stations and listen from the same interface.
You can pick up your copy of Rhythmbox at <a href="http://www.rhythmbox.org" target="_self">www.rhythmbox.org</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7139f2.large.jpg"><img src="7139f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Your Very Own
Rhythmbox
</p></div></div><p>
Rhythmbox plays its songs using the gstreamer package, so that's
an important prerequisite. Building Rhythmbox from source isn't
difficult, but I did wind up spending some time looking for all the
various required GNOME development packages. These included the development packages for bonobo, GTK+, pango, gnomeui, atk,
gconf and others. I mention this because I found myself going back
quite a few times for packages I was missing when building this one.
Binaries are available for those who would like a shortcut.
For a great RPM repository, try <a href="http://rpm.pbone.net" target="_self">rpm.pbone.net</a>. But I
digress; Rhythmbox is another extract and build five-step
project, so no big surprises there:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -xzvf rhythmbox-0.5.3.tar.gz
cd rhythmbox-0.5.3
./configure
make
su -c "make install"
</pre>
</p><p>
When you start Rhythmbox for the first time, you're met with a small
question-and-answer dialog. As part of that setup, you are asked
where on the system you store your music. You can either provide a
pathname here or skip the step entirely. If you skip it, you can add your
songs manually. Rhythmbox reads the song titles, artist name,
album title and so on from each cut's tag and sorts the whole thing
automatically. Using the tag editor, you also can rate the songs from zero
to five stars and then use that rating to look for your favorite tunes.
</p><p>
The final item on tonight's menu bills itself as &ldquo;the one
music manager to rule them all&rdquo;, a boast that certainly makes
you take notice. On that note, I think we all should take a
minute to sip our wines. The program to rule them all
is Andreas Kl&ouml;ckner's <b  >Madman</b> (Figure 3), and it is
housed at <a href="http://madman.sourceforge.net/index.php" target="_self">madman.sourceforge.net/index.php</a>.
</p><p>
Should you decide to build Madman from source, you need to do
a reprise of your old friend, the extract and build five-step.
At the time of this writing, Madman's source release package was
madman-0.91.1.tar.gz.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7139f3.large.jpg"><img src="7139f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You don't have to be
mad to use Madman.
</p></div></div><p>
Obviously, the basic features of Madman are much the same as
JuK's and Rhythmbox's in that it provides an interface that allows you to
organize your music collection and play selected songs. That said,
Madman really is different&mdash;it even feels different. For instance, the
search function is ridiculously flexible. Let's say you wanted to
play a song by Celine Dion, but you didn't know how to spell Celine.
Simply enter <tt  >selin</tt> or something that looks like it
might be right, and Madman locates the song for you (Figure 4). <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mais
oui</em></span>,
of course I know how to spell it.
</p><p>
But wait, there's more. In the bottom part of Madman's main
screen sits another one of Madman's cool features. The program
automatically tracks which songs you've listened to completely
and how often. So, you create an automatic list of favorites, simply
by listening. You also can right-click on a song and assign it a rating
using a five-star system.
</p><p>
Madman starts by asking you to enter directories in which you store
your songs. This is a simple add dialog where you can add as many as
you like. All the music in your collection can be accessed by artist,
genre or album title. You also can search for a song using Madman's
aforementioned super-flexible search engine. When you find a song
you like, highlight it and press F9; press F10 to play it next.
Alternatively, you can choose totally random select.
</p><p>
While the other two programs I looked at tonight play directly from
the interface, with the machinery hidden in the background,
Madman fires up XMMS to do the actual playing. An option can be found in
the preferences dialog to select a different player, but
at this time, XMMS seems to be the only option available.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7139f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Madman lets
you search for a song even if you can't spell it.
</p></div></div><p>
There's a lot to like about Madman. When I rip and encode CDs, I
sometimes find the information isn't properly carried through
into the tag. As a result, I'll get a blank listing. No problem; press
F9 to play it, check the title in XMMS's display and edit the tag in-line
on Madman's display with a slow double-click.
</p><p>
What did you say, Fran&ccedil;ois? Ah, thank you. I'm sorry, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>,
but it appears as though we have sailed right through another evening.
Where does the time go, eh? Still, at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, we never want
you to leave without one more leisurely glass of wine, so I will have
Fran&ccedil;ois pour you a final glass. Since you all have Linux systems at
your tables, why not bring up the jukebox program of your choice, put
on the headphones and listen to one last song while you finish your wine.
Until next time, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, let us drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute; Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
