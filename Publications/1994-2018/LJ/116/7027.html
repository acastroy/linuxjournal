Lindows is a Linux distribution intended to be as easy to use as
possible, even for complete beginners.
The Lindows promotional literature promised a ten-minute install, and
indeed, the process took about ten minutes.
</p><p>
Lindows 4.0 comes with two CDs. One is the installation CD, which
detects all your hardware and installs Lindows. The other is a demo CD,
which detects all your hardware and then runs Lindows in RAM,
loading any applications directly from the CD. You can use the demo CD
to try out Lindows 4.0 on a computer without overwriting your data.
I booted up the demo CD, and it worked as advertised. It let me
experiment with Lindows and did not write to my hard disk.
</p><p>
Next, I installed Lindows on a spare computer. When you begin the
installation you are offered
two choices: automatic disk partitioning (labeled &ldquo;take over the whole
hard disk&rdquo;) or manual partitioning for advanced users. I let the
Lindows installer take over the whole hard disk.
It created a small boot partition and a 256MB swap partition; it then
filled the rest of the disk with a single large ReiserFS partition.
</p><p>
The installer asked few questions, none of which concerned what kind of hardware the computer
had; the installer detected hardware without prompting.
At the end of the install, the installer prompted me to enter an
optional system password. This password is, in fact, the root password. By
default, Lindows sets up the user to run as root all the time and only
weakly encourages the user even to set a password for root. This design
certainly is a convenient way to set up a system, but it gives up much of
the traditional security inherent in Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f26580.0x201f108"></a>
Running</h2></div></div><p>
Lindows is based mostly on KDE. The desktop is a KDE desktop, heavily
customized with the Lindows brand. The custom theme's icons run to
green and blue colors that match the Lindows logo.
</p><p>
Lindows 4.0 defaults to Mozilla for both Web surfing and e-mail.
Mozilla is rebranded as &ldquo;Lindows Internet Suite&rdquo;, and unless
you run <tt  >mozilla --version</tt> at a shell prompt, it is difficult to figure out that
it is version 1.3.
</p><p>
Konqueror, rebranded as File Manager and Web Browser, is the default
file manager for Lindows. Desktop icons for My Computer, My
Documents and Network Browser all open Konqueror to the appropriate
location.
</p><p>
When I tried out a command prompt, I discovered that Lindows was missing
some important tools, such as the <b  >man</b> command. Fortunately, Lindows is
based on Debian GNU/Linux and contains a working core Debian system. By
running <b  >apt-get</b> I was able to install man, vim and other must-haves for
the more advanced user.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f26580.0x201f478"></a>
Click-N-Run</h2></div></div><p>
The most impressive part of Lindows is the Click-N-Run system. With
Click-N-Run you can browse through a virtual warehouse divided into
categories, with aisles (departments) containing software packages.
For example, in the Multimedia &amp; Design category you can find an aisle
named Image Editing, which contains various image editors including The
GIMP. If you click on the Click-N-Run icon next to The GIMP, it is
added to your Click-N-Run queue and automatically installed.
</p><p>
Because Click-N-Run starts up as soon as you log in, it can download
software continuously in the background while you work. As long as you
are connected to the Internet, Click-N-Run downloads packages until
your queue is empty again. You can open the Click-N-Run client to check
on the status of your queue and to see what's already installed, see what's
pending, cancel pending downloads and so on.
</p><p>
One nice touch, the Programs menu in the main program launcher is
organized exactly the same as the Click-N-Run Warehouse. Thus, after you
have installed The GIMP, you can find it by clicking on Start
Applications, Programs, Multimedia &amp; Design, The GIMP. The icons on the
categories are the same icons used in the Click-N-Run Warehouse as well,
so the system is visually well organized, too.
</p><p>
In order to use Click-N-Run, you need to sign up with Lindows for a
Click-N-Run account. This costs from $50 to $150 US per year, depending on
what level of account you choose. Much of the Click-N-Run software is free
software, such as The GIMP, but some proprietary
software also is offered. If you use Click-N-Run to download a proprietary
package, you are billed automatically.
</p><p>
Among the available proprietary software packages are VirusSafe, a virus
scanner based on Vexira Antivirus, and SurfSafe, a Web site blocker based
on the Cerberian Web Filter. With SurfSafe in place, trying to access a site
like <a href="http://playboy.com" target="_self">playboy.com</a> brings up the &ldquo;LindowsFamily
&mdash; SurfSafe
Warning&rdquo; page.
</p><p>
Click-N-Run isn't perfect. When I installed MPlayer, it didn't work, but
returned
with no error message&mdash;it simply shut down. By running MPlayer from a
command prompt, I was able to see an error message explaining that the
.mplayer directory was not set up correctly. But Click-N-Run worked
well for the other packages I tried.
</p><p>
I was somewhat annoyed at the relentless rebranding of packages that
exists in Lindows 4.
KWrite, the KDE word processor, is available in Click-N-Run, but it's
called Write Pro. GTKPool is called Billiards; Gnumeric is rebranded
as Numeric. Some other packages retain their names&mdash;but does a typical
Lindows user know what TK Gocr is? If Lindows needs to come up with
friendly names, I would hope they include the original name in the new
one, as they do with <span   class="emphasis"><em>XGalaga Galactic Invaders</em></span>. Or, at
least mention the original name somewhere
on the Click-N-Run information page.
</p><p>
In the future, it should be possible to use Click-N-Run to upgrade from
a previous version of Lindows to a newer one. However, Click-N-Run
currently cannot upgrade from Lindows 3.0 to Lindows 4.0; you need to use the
Lindows 4.0 CD.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f26580.0x201f8f0"></a>
Creating Users</h2></div></div><p>
At the end of Lindows setup, you have the option to create user
accounts. Also, after setup, the standard KDE tool for managing users,
KUser, is available in the Settings menu as User Manager. It's simple
to create non-root users with this tool. Then, after the computer boots
up, the KDM login manager prompts for a user name and password.
</p><p>
I highly recommend that you create a separate account for each person who
will use the Lindows computer. For more on
managing user accounts in Lindows, see my companion article on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web site (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7166" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/7166</a>).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1f26580.0x201fb00"></a>
Family License</h2></div></div><p>
The Lindows Family License permits Lindows customers to install Lindows
on multiple computers, as long as all the computers are in the
customer's household. Click-N-Run has a section, My Products, that
shows all software installed by the Click-N-Run user; this includes
proprietary software licensed by the user. Any software the
user has installed with Click-N-Run on a different computer is listed in
a dim-grey font, while software installed on the current computer is shown in
black. It's easy to click on grey packages and select them for
downloading and installing on the current computer.
</p><p>
Thus, any proprietary software purchased using Click-N-Run
actually is
licensed for all Lindows computers in the purchaser's
household. If you run proprietary software and your
household has multiple computers, this license potentially could be a good
deal.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Click-N-Run is the slickest package installation system I have seen yet
in a Linux distribution, but you must pay a minimum of $50 per year to
use it. The Lindows system is mostly smooth and polished, but a few
rough edges remain.
</p><p>
If you read <i  >Linux Journal</i>, it is unlikely that you will want to run
Lindows on your own computer. But, it is a possibility
that family members or friends would appreciate a Linux system designed for newbies.
As long as you set them up to not run as root all the time, Lindows
is a good choice.
