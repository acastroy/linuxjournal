    We compare features, convenience and performance of the leading
    DVD-playing software for Linux and cover some important tweaks for smooth playback.
  </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1607298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I love movies. I'm a fan of films from almost every genre, from various
countries and in various languages. Last Christmas, Ivy
and I received a DVD player from her kids, and since then I've
become an unabashed convert to the medium. Images are sharper, sound is
clearer and the medium itself permits my choice of amenities such as
subtitling, scene selection (aka chapters) and language preference. The
only real problem I have with the player is it resides at her house
and not mine. I don't even own a television, so purchasing a standalone
DVD player also would mean buying a TV, and that's a purchase I'd rather
not make. However, I do have a nice 19" monitor attached to my computer
and a good video card to drive it. So the logical step is to add a
DVD drive to my machine and configure my system for DVD playback. This
article describes how I did that, the problems I encountered and my
impressions of the software used for the job.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x16073a0"></a>
The Test Platform</h2></div></div><p>
I learned a lot about hardware while setting up my system for DVD play.
My machine is capable of enjoyable glitch-free playback, but it took some
tweaking to squeeze the most performance out of it. Here, I describe
my system as it was used for this article, but I also describe what I
recommend for a more current base system. Hardware matters a lot in this
domain, so make sure your system can handle the
audio/video requirements for the best DVD viewing and listening
experience.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x16074a8"></a>
The Real</h2></div></div><p>
My DVD drive is an inexpensive unit purchased from a friend who had it
lying around his apartment. dmesg reports this information about the
drive:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hdd: LITEON DVD-ROM LTD163D, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1607608"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you're in doubt as to what kind of drive is in your machine,
run <tt  >dmesg | grep DVD</tt> for a report. Linux has exceptional support for DVD drives; in fact, the
Linux Hardware Compatibility HOWTO states that virtually all ATAPI and
SCSI DVD-ROM and DVD-RW drives are supported. If you're looking for
recommended brands or are concerned about a specific drive, a quick search on
Google should turn up the needed information.
</p><p>
The base machine also includes an 800MHz AMD Duron processor, two 15GB
hard disks and 512MB of RAM. The display hardware is a generic 19"
monitor connected to an NVIDIA GeForce2 video card with 64MB of video RAM.
Audio is handled by a Sound Blaster Live! Value card and a sound system that
includes a Yamaha DMP7 digital mixer, a 100-watt QSC power amplifier
and a pair of Yorkville Sound YS-10 studio monitors. The kernel is
compiled for low latency, and all drives are tuned for optimal disk
throughput.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x16077c0"></a>
The Recommended</h2></div></div><p>
I prefer a faster CPU, something 1GHz or higher. I have received
reports of decent DVD playback on 600MHz and slower machines, but
at less than 1GHz you need to tune your other system
components more finely. If you like to watch films in wide-screen mode, I recommend at least a 19" screen for comfortable viewing. Your
graphics chipset should support the XFree86 Xv extension (most do), and
your card should have at least 16MB of video RAM. The Creative Labs
Sound Blaster Live! or Audigy 2 sound cards are excellent choices for stereo or 5.1
audio output configurations. The low-latency kernel is not absolutely
necessary, but your DVD drive performance can and should be optimized.
I discuss kernel options and tuning your drive in the next section.
</p><p>
One more note regarding an optimal audio system. Many DVDs support 5.1
Surround Sound and other audio options that may or may not be possible
under Linux. An inexpensive 5.1 speaker system is fine for casual
use, but if you're serious about sound you probably want to invest in
a high-quality system. See the Tom's Hardware Guide URL in this
article's Resources section on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> Web
site (<a href="../116/7174.html" target="_self">/article/7174</a>) for more information regarding available 4.1 and 5.1
sound systems for PC sound cards.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x16079d0"></a>
Configuration Considerations</h2></div></div><p>
The base Linux installation used for these tests is a heavily modified
Red Hat 7.2, but the methods and procedures described here should apply
to any relatively recent mainstream distribution with only minor changes
(if any). Plain-vanilla Linux is not likely to yield optimal results for
DVD performance, so following are a few tips I gathered from the Web and
from the documentation for various players tested. The main
considerations concern optimizing the kernel itself, tuning X, tuning
the DVD drive and ensuring you have the correct device mountpoint.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1607ad8"></a>
Kernel Options</h2></div></div><p>
Some kernel options should be activated for optimizing DVD
playback. I strongly urge the application of Andrew Morton's low-latency
patches, and it also may be advisable to apply Robert Love's
preemptive kernel patch. The combination of these patches provides very
low latency (below 3msecs) over sustained periods of time. My kernel of
choice is currently 2.4.18, but Andrew's and Robert's patches are
available for a variety of kernel releases (see Resources
for more information).
</p><p>
You also should make sure your kernel has enabled support for the RTC
and MTRR options (found under the Character devices and
Processor
type and features kernel configuration sections, respectively). RTC
provides access to the real-time hardware clock of your PC. According to
the kernel configuration help file, all PCs have such a clock but it is
not enabled by the default kernel configuration. Although it is not
absolutely required, many Linux audio and video applications can utilize
this clock for a finer timing response (MPlayer likes it), so I suggest
building it directly into your kernel or as a dynamically loadable module.
</p><p>
According to the kernel configuration help, enabling the MTRR (memory
type range registers) provides a mechanism that is used:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...to control processor access to memory ranges. This is most
useful if you have a video (VGA) card on a PCI or AGP bus. Enabling
write-combining allows bus write transfers to be combined into a
larger transfer before bursting over the PCI/AGP bus. This can
increase performance of image write operations 2.5 times or more.
</p></blockquote></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1607d40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
So, if you have a PCI or AGP video card you will want to enable
this option.
</p><p>
Under the ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL Support section, I advise enabling the
options for generic PCI bus-master DMA support and the use of PCI DMA by
default.
</p><p>
The last step is to configure sound support for your hardware. I
use the ALSA sound system, so all I do is enable sound card support in
the kernel options. The ALSA drivers are built in normal user space and
installed as root as loadable kernel modules. You safely can
use the available kernel modules instead of ALSA, but in my opinion the
ALSA drivers are superior.
In fact, ALSA will become the de facto kernel sound system for Linux kernels
beyond the 2.5.x series.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1607ef8"></a>
The X Factor</h2></div></div><p>
I began my tests with XFree86 4.1.0. Everything seemed to work fine
except for an annoying problem with xine: after closing that player my X
server would unceremoniously crash, dumping me back at the console
prompt. When I upgraded to
XFree86 4.3.0 and the latest driver for my GeForce2 from NVIDIA
(1.0-4363), all problems were resolved. Because XFree86 4.3.0
fixes a number of problems and bugs found in the earlier versions, I
suggest the upgrade to anyone using any of these players, not only xine.
And, if you're using an NVIDIA card you always should use their latest
drivers.
</p><p>
As mentioned earlier, XFree86 provides a video output driver called Xv,
but other drivers are available for the frame-buffer device, SDL (Simple
DirectMedia Layer) video output and X11/Xshm. The driver you select
affects playback performance. Xv normally is preferred, but you can
experiment with whatever drivers are supported by your player of choice
for the best output.
</p><p>
My X environment also includes the Blackbox window manager. I prefer simple and fast,
and Blackbox fits the bill for me. Be advised that your DVD-viewing
mileage may vary in part due to your window manager or desktop
environment of choice, and you may need to adjust your available video
resources accordingly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x16080b0"></a>
Tuning the Drive</h2></div></div><p>
It may come as a surprise to learn that you can tune your DVD and CD-ROM
drives as easily as you can tune your hard disks. The hdparm utility can
optimize drive performance to peak efficiency, run it
(as root) with at least the following parameter options:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hdparm -c1 -d1 -a8 -u1 /dev/hdd
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1608210"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where -c1 enables 32-bit I/O, -d1 enables DMA access, -a8 sets the
filesystem read-ahead value and -u1 sets the drive's interrupt-unmask
flag. /dev/hdd should specify your particular DVD drive device
location.
</p><p>
The parameters shown above work well with my DVD drive, but I urge you
to read the hdparm manual page (<tt  >man hdparm</tt>) before running the
utility. Your DVD drive is a read-only device, so filesystem corruption
is not an issue here. You might, however, inadvertently lower your drive's
efficiency with non-optimal settings.
</p><p>
It has been brought to my attention that Red Hat 8.0 users have reported
difficulties enabling DMA on their DVD drives. If you're running that
distribution, add the following line to your /etc/modules.conf to fix the
problem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
options ide-cd dma=1
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1608478"></a>
About /dev/dvd</h2></div></div><p>
The players reviewed here all expect to find the default hardware mountpoint at /dev/dvd. Though they all also allow a user-specified location,
I suggest making things easier by making
/dev/dvd. Typically the drive itself actually is /dev/cdrom, so you may
need to create a link from /dev/cdrom to /dev/dvd. Simply issue the following command (again as root) to make the link:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ln -sf /dev/cdrom /dev/dvd
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have multiple CD/DVD-type drives, you need to specify the
correct device number for /dev/cdrom; for example, mine is /dev/cdrom1 because
my CD-RW drive sits at /dev/cdrom.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1608630"></a>
The Test DVDs</h2></div></div><p>
I tested the players with a variety of DVDs, all legitimately
manufactured and purchased.
My local library lends DVDs, many of which are in less-than-optimal
condition, and they played fine on the test system, with the single
exception of an incredibly bad duplication of Bruce Lee's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chinese
Connection</em></span>. I even was able to watch a truly awful DVD of dubious
origin, a remarkable event given that our standalone DVD player wouldn't
even recognize the disc in its drive. I'm happy to report that in all
tests the options for subtitling, language selection, chapter jumps and
skins worked.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1608790"></a>
Linux DVD Players</h2></div></div><p>
So your kernel is configured, the DVD drive is
installed and connected, and you're ready to watch
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Shrek</em></span> for
the 40th time. All you need now is a player application, and happily
Linux has some excellent DVD player software. The profiles below
focus on four of the most popular players: MPlayer, Ogle, VideoLAN
Client and xine. See the Freshmeat listings for other available players and DVD
amenities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x16088f0"></a>
Expectations</h2></div></div><p>
I've already used a standalone DVD player, so I expect to find most of
its features in whatever software player I select. In the players
reviewed here, I looked for support for these minimum features:
standard transport controls (start, stop, pause, fast-forward and rewind),
scene selection, subtitling and audio preferences and
DVD menus. In addition to the amenities found on the standalone hardware
player, I
expect a software DVD player to switch from windowed to full-screen
view easily and to offer random seek/relocate, keyboard control of all transport
functions and skin support.
</p><p>
Most of my expectations were satisfied by the players I
reviewed. See Table 1 for an overview of
versions, features, licensing and CPU stress. All of them performed
with excellent results, with no clear winner in the &ldquo;Best Of&rdquo; category.
My advice is to try them all, then use the one(s) that seem best to you.
In terms of weight, Ogle is the lightest (it's a DVD-only player)
while the others all come in with about the same metric tonnage.
Although I briefly described building the programs, the reader should
check the player Web sites for available RPMs and other prepackaged
binaries.

Win32 Codecs and the DeCSS</h2></div></div><p>
Much of the magic performed by these players comes from their use of
video codecs (compression/decompression libraries) found in Windows and
the Mac OS. In particular, MPlayer and xine require certain codecs to
play files in formats such as Microsoft's ASF/WMV and Apple's QuickTime
MOV. These codecs usually are not provided by the source or
binary packages for the players themselves, but they are acquired easily.
I advise getting whatever collections
are currently available. Most of us want
the standard packages, but if you're a die-hard video fanatic you might
as well download and install them all. The legal status of acquiring and
utilizing these codecs is somewhat unclear, but because they are available
now I suggest getting them right away. It might prove difficult to do so at a
later date.
</p><p>
The notorious DeCSS is a descrambler for DVDs encrypted with the
Content Scrambling System (CSS). The original
DeCSS software was proprietary and binary-only, but it has been
reverse engineered and has spread through the Internet.
A great deal of ink and ill-will has been spilled over CSS, and the DVD
legal battles are far from over. For more information regarding the
issues involved, please read the material at <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/openlaw/DVD" target="_self">cyber.law.harvard.edu/openlaw/DVD</a>.
None of the
players discussed here require DeCSS. The open-source libdvdcss is used for
runtime CSS decryption and does not require a region-locked DVD player.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1600888"></a>
MPlayer</h2></div></div><p>
MPlayer is undoubtedly the most full-featured player reviewed here. It
is considerably more than a DVD player, handling files in far too many
video and audio formats to list here. Suffice it to say that if it's video,
MPlayer likely can play it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6921f1.large.jpg"><img src="6921f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. MPlayer with Blue Skin
</p></div></div><p>
MPlayer's DVD support meets the standard expectations listed above, and
it adds a few features I now can't live without, including
its equalizer, a control for audio equalization (EQ) as well as video
EQ. Brightness, contrast, hue and saturation can be controlled
by the equalizer's sliders.
Both audio and video EQ can be controlled in real time with
smooth responses. Another nice feature is the ability to set the aspect
ratio, that is, how much of your available screen space is occupied by the
picture. I don't use this feature so much with DVDs, as most discs
are available in wide-screen or standard formats, often on the same disc.
Finally, MPlayer provides preset normal, double and full-screen modes
for your viewing pleasure.
</p><p>
I really like MPlayer, but I must advise that its build
procedure can be somewhat complex. Look over the myriad of
configuration options carefully before building the program (see the
results from <tt  >./configure --help</tt>). For instance, the
MPlayer GUI is
not included by default and must be enabled explicitly. DVD menus
are supported with libdvdnav, but the documentation for
MPlayer 0.90 indicates that menu support currently is not working.
MPlayer's extensive documentation explains every aspect of the program,
including compilation details. Look there before you post a complaint to the MPlayer mail list.
</p><p>
One more note concerning MPlayer: its developers are not fond of certain
versions of GCC 2.96, nor do they particularly recommend NVIDIA graphics
cards. Their stated position is to not answer questions
from users with systems owning those components, which is a bit of a
problem for me because I have an NVIDIA card and
a version of GCC 2.96 on my machine. Nevertheless, I have compiled and
used MPlayer under those build conditions and am quite happy with the
results. If you have problems when compiling MPlayer with those factors,
a Google search should resolve them. In all fairness, I must add that
the MPlayer developer and user community is otherwise quite helpful.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1600ca8"></a>
Ogle</h2></div></div><p>
Unlike the other players reviewed, Ogle is strictly a DVD player&mdash;but
what a DVD player it is. Ogle was the first player to support DVD menus,
and its other amenities include bookmarks, time skipping, multichannel
audio, SPDIF audio output (a digital audio format) and crop and zoom
video. The bookmarks function is unique and sweet: I can stop anywhere
within a movie, bookmark my position, then return to that position later
simply by clicking on the mark. It may not seem like an exciting feature,
but it is handy. With the Goggles GUI, Ogle also supports the option
to start play upon opening; that is, Ogle automatically starts playing
the disc in the drive.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6921f2.large.jpg"><img src="6921f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Ogle with Goggles GUI and gxvattr
</p></div></div><p>
Ogle by itself can be used from the command line. It also
can be built with a native GUI, and a number of third-party GUIs are
available from the Ogle Web site. Personally, I like having a control
panel handy, and I especially like the appearance of the Goggles GUI,
but Ogle's keyboard mapping is excellent.
Also, the Goggles GUI requires the FOX toolkit, which is not commonly
found in mainstream Linux distributions. The Ogle Web site can direct
you to the Goggles home, where you can find out how to acquire the
FOX toolkit.
</p><p>
I'm also happy that Ogle's documentation directed me to the xvattr
utility. The xv driver typically is the default video output driver
for Ogle and the other players reviewed here, and its capabilities
usually can be modified by preference settings in the players themselves.
However, xvattr is a standalone utility that queries your video card for
its specific xv-related capabilities and allows direct user control over
them from the command line (or the gxvattr GUI). I found it to be
quite handy when trying to resolve some frame rate difficulties due to
my NVIDIA card's default double buffering (I was able to switch it off
using xvattr). I advise using xvattr to learn more about your video
card's particular xv-related capabilities.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1601018"></a>
VideoLAN Client</h2></div></div><p>
VideoLAN Client (VLC) is one part of a project intended to provide a
cross-platform client/server solution for A/V (audio/video) streaming
over high-bandwidth networks. According to the excellent VideoLAN
documentation, the project includes the VideoLAN Server (VLS), which can stream MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4
files, DVDs, digital satellite channels, digital terrestrial
television channels and live videos on the network in unicast or
multicast. It also includes the
VideoLAN Client (VLC), which can be used as a server to
stream MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 files and DVDs on the network in
unicast or multicast. It also can be used as a client to receive, decode and
display MPEG streams under multiple operating systems.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6921f3.large.jpg"><img src="6921f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. VideoLAN Client Controls and Preferences Dialog
</p></div></div><p>
As a standalone DVD player, VLC's performance is in line with the rest
of the players reviewed. Its CPU usage was the lowest measured,
making VLC a first-choice solution for networked machines or relatively
low-powered systems. VLC's GUI isn't especially exciting, but it works
smoothly and flawlessly. If you don't need extensive file format support
or if your system fits the target model, then I have no hesitation
recommending VLC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1601330"></a>
xine</h2></div></div><p>
If MPlayer and xine were horses in a race, they'd be side by
side at the finish line. xine is somewhat easier to build (the xine
developers are not as parochial about your compiler and video card), and it
includes all needed libraries within the source package, as well as
its GUI in the default build. It also supports DVD menus by
default, plays a wide variety of video formats and uses a video EQ
similar to the one found in MPlayer. xine's GUI is a little strange at
first, but it is actually well organized and easily navigated.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6921f4.large.jpg"><img src="6921f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. xine with default GUI
</p></div></div><p>
xine's performance is second to none. I was concerned about the
results of my original test of its CPU usage, but I discovered the
program remembered a &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; setting I had made while experimenting
with its video output drivers. I had told xine to try the xshm driver,
not realizing that subsequent sessions would continue to use that
driver. Nothing was wrong with the driver itself, I simply
noticed that xine's CPU usage was much higher than the results for the
other players. Resetting the output driver to xv dramatically lowered
CPU consumption, so I've been a little more careful with any changes I
make to xine's default settings. You also can run the handy xine-check for a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of your
system's capabilities analyzed with regard to xine's performance.
</p><p>
The only feature I miss in xine is an interface for random chapter
selection. I can jump to scenes before or after the current location,
but at this time there is no graphic representation of the chapters tree
&agrave; la Ogle or MPlayer. However, scene selection from the DVD menu itself
is fully supported, so as long as the disc includes a menu with scene
selection, xine performs random chapter jumps. One other
item of possible complaint is xine's inclusion of its required libraries
within the source tree. Apparently this bothers some people, but I
consider it to be a great convenience. I didn't have to run around the Web to
find what I needed to complete the build; all I needed (except the
Win32 and Apple codecs) was included with the original package.
</p><p>
Incidentally, although xine's default GUI is handsome and perfectly usable,
a variety of alternative user interfaces can be found on the xine home
page. Some nice-looking GUIs are shown, including one that shows
your video output in an ASCII character display.
</p><p>
As with the other players, xine's community maintains a number of highly
active mail lists. If you have questions about xine that are not
answered in its excellent documentation, you certainly can find help
from its community of developers
and users.

Ripping, Burning and Hardware Decoding</h2></div></div><p>
Rather than trying to rewrite the excellent and exhaustive advice found at
<a href="http://bunkus.org" target="_self">bunkus.org</a>,
here is some brief advice regarding ripping a
DVD. Get a big hard disk, install either mencode or transcode (and its
dvd::rip GUI) and follow the detailed instructions on the bunkus site.
Ripping a DVD can involve a large number of options, so
plan ahead for best results. The author of the bunkus
site recommends at least 10GB of free space per disc ripped.
Also, even using a fast CPU, the ripping process can consume many
hours.
</p><p>
I don't own a DVD burner, so I can give no useful advice regarding the
process other than mentioning that J&ouml;rg Schilling's excellent <span   class="bold"><b>cdrecord</b></span> is at the heart of it. However, as with
ripping DVDs, a number of on-line articles are listed in the Resources
section on the Web (<a href="../116/7174.html" target="_self">/article/7174</a>) that describe the
process in some detail.
</p><p>
While preparing material for this article I asked members of the Linux
Audio Users mail list what DVD software they used. MPlayer and xine were
the clear winners, but one respondent asked whether I intended to cover
hardware DVD decoding boards. Alas, I have no experience with such
hardware and welcome feedback from any readers who have used them.

Documentation and Support</h2></div></div><p>
Apparently none of the developers of the players reviewed ever wanted to
be accused of supplying inadequate documentation. MPlayer, VideoLAN
Client and xine supply especially extensive docs for developers and
normal users. Ogle provides somewhat less exhaustive documentation, but
it's also the most narrowly focused player reviewed, and its manual page
(<tt  >man ogle</tt>) is excellent. All of these players have extensive support
available through highly active mail lists and list archives.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x150f580.0x1915168"></a>
The Final Frame</h2></div></div><p>
The players reviewed all show remarkable longevity and maturity. Linux
may not be an obvious first choice for a multimedia platform, but it's
certainly becoming difficult to ignore the fact that it is rapidly
evolving into a superb platform for audio and video play. I encourage
readers to check out the software listed and reviewed here, and I look
forward to receiving your reports. Have fun, but remember to try to
get some real work done too.
