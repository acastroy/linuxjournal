TRENDnet's THA-101 Home Smart Switch with Wireless Extender</h2></div></div><p>
So your attic is the only place where real work happens, Junior is hooked on
Angry Birds Transformers, and the router is in the basement. What to do?
TRENDnet seeks to keep you productive in any of your home's Wi-Fi-free corners
with its new THA-101 Home Smart Switch with Wireless Extender, a combination
smart electrical outlet and powerful N300 wireless extender. Simply place the
THA-101 in a location where you get at least two bars worth of home wireless
signal from an existing wireless network. Next, plug in the THA-101 and follow
a quick app-based installation. The powerful built-in N300 wireless extender
then broadcasts a strong wireless signal to an area of your home with low or no
wireless coverage. Then, plug anything in to the THA-101's electrical outlet and
use the free mobile app to control the outlet from a mobile device with an
Internet connection, including an on/off schedule. The app also displays a
delicious feast of geek-friendly data, namely real-time current, voltage, power
and total energy consumption.

AdaCore's GNATdashboard</h2></div></div><p>
The Ada programming language is geared toward industries where software is
mission-critical and often safety- or security-critical as well. Ergo, quality
assurance monitoring in Ada, which is what AdaCore's new GNATdashboard is
all about, is of utmost importance. GNATdashboard is AdaCore's new tool
that serves as a control panel for monitoring and improving the quality of Ada
software. The new tool feeds code-quality information from AdaCore's tools
to the open-source SonarQube code quality management platform and Squoring
Technologies' SQUORE quality and performance decision support solution.
This helps quality assurance managers and project leaders understand or
reduce their software's technical debt, eliminating the need for manual
input. GNATdashboard fits naturally into a continuous integration environment,
says AdaCore, providing users with metrics on code complexity, code coverage,
conformance to coding standards and more.

Violin Memory's Oracle Performance Analysis Service (O-PAS)</h2></div></div><p>
Poor database and application performance easily can result in lost revenue,
extra IT and database manpower expenses, and unacceptable operational and
capital expenses. Solving this bundle of challenges is the inspiration for
Violin Memory's new Oracle Performance Analysis Service, or O-PAS, a free tool
designed to remove the complexity of reporting, analyzing and decision-making
around Oracle databases. The goal with O-PAS is to assist database
administrators, application owners, IT executives and resellers in making
informed decisions and selecting the right solution for achieving significant
performance improvements and cost savings. The Violin O-PAS identifies core
performance bottlenecks in end users' Oracle environments and determines
the suitability of Flash-based storage solutions to increase
IOPS, reduce latency and lower overall costs substantially. The tool generates comprehensive
reports that identify areas in Oracle implementations where massive performance
improvements can be gained by using all-Flash arrays and the associated cost
savings that they enable.

Ron Fuller, David Jansen and Matthew McPherson's <span   class="emphasis"><em>NX-OS Configuration Fundamentals
LiveLessons</em></span> (Cisco Press)</h2></div></div><p>
NX-OS is an embedded Linux-based network OS from Cisco Systems that is designed
to support the high-performance, high-reliability server-access switches found
in data centers. Network engineers or operators who want to gain a solid
understanding of NX-OS technologies would be wise to investigate a new video
training product called <span   class="emphasis"><em>NX-OS Configuration Fundamentals
LiveLessons</em></span> from Cisco
Press. Authors Ron Fuller, David Jansen and Matthew McPherson offer 12 hours of
instruction on NX-OS technologies and configuration, covering 13 individual
video lessons, which are in turn subdivided into 88 sub-lessons. The lessons
guide students from an introduction to the product families and operating
system to Layer 2 and 3 capabilities before moving on to multicast and
security. High availability, unique embedded serviceability features, and
Unified Fabric and the Nexus 1000v are covered as well, followed by QoS, OTV,
MPLS and LISP.

DigLinks' CIMT</h2></div></div><p>
Problems like server breakdowns, errors related to hardware and software
management and typical technical issues that stymie everyday business
operations can all add unplanned costs. To help businesses minimize these
costs, system and network solution provider DigLinks created the Configuration
and Identity Management, or CIMT, a new open-source IT management solution that
allows for central, user-friendly management of the entire IT infrastructure in
small- to large-scale enterprises. DigLinks states that CIMT can be integrated
into IT landscapes easily and with minimal effort&mdash;irrespective of the
number of systems, types of operating systems, hardware components or network
connections. In addition, a customized, scalable service package is available,
which frees companies from time-consuming routine work on their technical
operations and focuses on their core business. CIMT is written in Java for
portability and covers all aspects of IT management&mdash;users, workstations, IPs,
network devices or servers, hardware and software&mdash;from a single application.

Ron Jeffries' <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Nature of Software Development</em></span> (Pragmatic
Bookshelf)</h2></div></div><p>
The only things you'll need to take advantage of Ron Jeffries' <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Nature of Software Development</em></span> are &ldquo;your Standard Issue Brain, a bit of
curiosity and a desire to build your own understanding&rdquo;. Subtitled
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Keep It
Simple, Make It Valuable, Build It Piece by Piece</em></span>, Jeffries' book is
intended to help you get value from your software project, perhaps not
&ldquo;free, now and perfect&rdquo; as you wish but at least &ldquo;cheaper,
sooner and better&rdquo;. Jeffries leads readers from the desire for value down to the
specific activities that help good Agile projects deliver better software
sooner and at a lower cost. Using simple sketches and a few words, Jeffries
invites readers to follow his path of learning and understanding from his
engagement with Agile methods from their very beginning. Jeffries also
illustrates why Agile methods ask for what they do, as well as why a shallow
implementation of Agile can lead to only limited improvement. The ultimate goal
is to embark on a long-term journey to make a project a bit more perfect each
day and ultimately end up with a deep understanding of the nature of software
development done well.

Pydio</h2></div></div><p>
Companies currently are exposed to massive liability when employees use
uncontrolled consumer services like Dropbox to share and store sensitive
company information. Breathe a sigh of relief ye IT departments and developers,
knowing that solutions like the new-and-improved Pydio 6.0 exist, a controlled,
open-source alternative to consumer cloud services. Formerly called AjaXplorer,
Pydio 6.0 is described as &ldquo;the first open-source file sharing solution to
deliver tight control of information on the scale demanded by enterprises and
service providers, and to combine this with the same intuitive ease of use
found in modern consumer apps and cloud services&rdquo;. The platform's
wealth of deeper, enterprise-focused features still are available for
power users and system administrators, but these have been moved to a second
level to avoid confusing the majority of users. The company also touts Pydio as
the perfect solution for developers looking to build intuitive multiplatform
file sharing into their own products or cloud service offerings. Finally, Pydio
enables the integration of different client applications (Linux, Android,
Windows, MacOS, iOS and so on) into a unified, multidevice platform.
