I don't listen to music very often. It's not that I don't like music,
it's just that I love books. If I have an opportunity to listen to
entertainment, I almost always go for an audiobook. For several years,
I've been using Smart AudioBook Player on my Android devices. I've
written about it before, and although it's still incredible, I have a
new favorite&mdash;namely, Listen Audiobook Player.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11811androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="11811androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Along with the normal bookmark features you'd expect from an audiobook
program, Listen provides:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Multi-device playback position sync via Dropbox.
</p></li><li><p>
Support for m4b, m4a, mp3, opus and ogg files (DRM-free).
</p></li><li><p>
Cover art downloading.
</p></li><li><p>
Variable speed playback with global default and individual book settings.
</p></li><li><p>
Automatic sleep timer with audio fade.
</p></li><li><p>
Bluetooth control support (play, pause, skip).
</p></li><li><p>
Widgets.
</p></li><li><p>
Elaborate appearance customization (colors, buttons and so on).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Although Listen isn't free, the $0.99 cost is more than fair for the
smooth-functioning, feature-rich application. When combined with FolderSync
to upload audiobook files automatically, I'm hard-pressed to think of a
better way to experience audiobooks. Since the author has a seven-day refund
policy, there's no reason not to give it a try (<a href="http://snar.co/listen" target="_self">snar.co/listen</a>).

<h2 class="title">Linux for Astronomers</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #250, February 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I've looked at specialty distributions that were created
for engineers and biologists in previous articles, but these aren't the only scientific
disciplines that have their own distributions. So in this article, I 
introduce a distribution created specifically for astronomers, called
Distro Astro (<a href="http://www.distroastro.org" target="_self">www.distroastro.org</a>). 
This distribution bundles together astronomy software to
help users with tasks like running observatories or planetariums, doing
professional research or outreach. 
</p><p>
From the very first moment of
booting up Distro Astro, you will notice that this distribution is aimed
at astronomers. The look and feel of items, from the
boot splash screen to wallpapers and screensavers, have all been given an
astronomical theme. Even the default wallpaper is a slideshow of Hubble
images.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11811distrof1.large.jpg"><img src="11811distrof1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Even the boot splash screen has an astronomy theme.

Figure 2. Once you boot up, you have desktop shortcuts pointing to a series of
different tasks.
</p></div></div><p>
There is also a unique feature 
called Nightvision Mode that lets you switch the color theme to red-based colors to help maintain your night vision when using the computer
during observations. Clicking on the menu item will
toggle this mode on or off. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11811distrof3.large.jpg"><img src="11811distrof3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. For night observations, you can turn on Nightvision Mode.
</p></div></div><p>
The advantage of having a domain-specific distribution is that all
of the software you likely will use is bundled together and
installed. Ideally, you shouldn't have to install anything other
than the distribution itself. 
</p><p>
The first task in astronomy is to
collect images of the sky. In Distro Astro, the INDI library
is pre-installed for you. This library is the main interface that is used
in telescope control. With it, you can control telescopes from Meade,
Celestron and Orion, among others. If you are lucky enough to have
a domed observatory, you even can control commercial domes, such as
those from Sirius Observatories. 
</p><p>
To be able to make your observations,
you need a front end to talk to your hardware. This access is provided
through clients like KStars, XEphem and Cartes du Ciel, which use the INDI
library to talk to your telescope. 
</p><p>
After aiming your telescope, you need
to collect some images or do some astrophotography. While you
can do some of this with software like KStars, you have software specifically
designed to do image capture. Some, like wxAstroCapture, are specifically
written for use in astronomy. With it, you can set
up automatic guiding and batch image collection. You then can go have a
nice hot cup of coffee while your telescope collects your data. To help
you keep track of all of these observations, you can use the Observation
Manager, a logging program to maintain your records.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11811distrof4.large.jpg"><img src="11811distrof4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can do image capture from your telescope with wxAstroCapture.
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have made your observations, you need to process them and do some
science with them. The first step is to do image processing. This
might be some filtering or some sort of feature identification
routine. One common task is image stacking, so much so that
Distro Astro includes the RegiStax package. With it,
you can set alignment points and do image analysis on full stacks of
images. You even can set up batch processes and run on multiple CPUs,
if you have them. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11811distrof5.large.jpg"><img src="11811distrof5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. With RegiStax, you can do image processing on full stacks of images.
</p></div></div><p>
You can do more complex image analysis with tools
provided by IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility). Sometimes,
however, the functions already available aren't enough, especially when you are
doing leading-edge research. In those cases, you are forced to write
your own algorithms to do this work. ImageJ is a very popular choice
that is available in Distro Astro. With it, you can develop and write
your own algorithms in Java.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the weather doesn't always allow for observations. So,
what can you do if you have been stuck away from the telescope for days on
end? Distro Astro includes a number of sky chart programs to allow you to
plan out your future observations. They also are really useful for budding
astronomers. You can use packages like Cartes du Ciel to learn about the
sky above your head. And there are several other options,
including Stellarium and Celestia. If you are more interested in deep sky
objects, there is a package called Where is M13?. 
This package shows objects from several catalogs, such as the Messier,
Caldwell, Collinder or NGC catalogs. The unique feature of this software
is that it can locate these deep sky objects in three dimensions. That way,
you can start to get a feel for where in space these objects actually are.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11811distrof6.large.jpg"><img src="11811distrof6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. With Carte du Ciel, you can learn more about the sky.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11811distrof7.large.jpg"><img src="11811distrof7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Where is M13? lets you see where deep sky objects are located around
you in three dimensions.
</p></div></div><p>
Part of science is outreach, sharing your findings with others and
inspiring them. One way of doing this is by putting on a planetarium
display. This is a way to expose a large number of people
to the wonders of the sky all at once. Several different software
packages are included in Distro Astro that can talk to planetarium
projectors. Packages like Celestia and OpenUniverse can be used with
non-fisheye projectors. If you have a more professional fisheye projector,
there is a modified fork of Stellarium called Nightshade Legacy that
is included in Distro Astro. The original version of Stellarium also
is included, giving you some choice in what is available.
</p><p>
With Distro Astro, you now easily can set up that observatory computer
or configure a machine to do your research runs on. And, with a live CD
option available, you have no excuse to keep you from downloading an ISO
and giving it a try. And with all of the packages included, you should
be able to burn a CD and run with nothing else to install.

<h2 class="title">Elementary, My Dear Linux User</h2>

I suspect there are as many Ubuntu-based Linux distributions as there
are all other distributions combined. Many of them are designed with a
specific purpose in mind. Whether the desire is for a different looking
desktop, custom kernel or just pre-installed packages, there's probably
a version of *buntu out there to fit every need. Elementary OS is just
another in a long list of variants, but what it does, it does very well.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11811elementf1.large.jpg"><img src="11811elementf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Upon first boot, Elementary obviously is designed to look and function
like OS X. Although that might turn the stomachs of die-hard Linux fans,
it provides an interesting platform for folks who appreciate the clean,
functional layout Apple provides on its flagship OS. Elementary
OS includes the Ubuntu Software Center, and like most variants, it can
install any program in the Ubuntu repositories. Out of the box, however,
it's a clean, fast operating system that people familiar with OS X will
recognize right away.
</p><p>
Elementary OS doesn't do anything particularly special compared to
other Linux distributions, but when I tried it, I really liked it. The
graphics are beautiful, and the default applications are lightning fast.
If you just want a simple, functional desktop, I urge you to give it
a try. At the time of this writing, the version based on Ubuntu 14.04
still is in beta, but the stable version is available today and looks
very similar. Give it a spin at <a href="http://elementaryos.org" target="_self">elementaryos.org</a>.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Homebrew</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #250, February 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I use OS X quite often during my day job. I'm able to tolerate it largely
due to the terminal. If I couldn't do my work with green text on a
black background, I think I'd go crazy (or crazier). Unfortunately,
OS X doesn't come with all the command-line tools I need. That's where
Homebrew comes in to save the day.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11811fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11811fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Homebrew acts like the package management system OS X is lacking. Using
commands very similar to apt-get, it allows the installation of hundreds
of applications. A perfect example is the wget program. I was surprised
to find that OS X doesn't include wget, but with Homebrew, it's a simple
one-liner away.
</p><p>
The best part is that Homebrew installs everything in the /usr/local
file space. There's no reason to worry about Homebrew corrupting your
system, because it doesn't touch anything outside of /usr/local. OS X
system updates won't overwrite your programs, and because /usr/local/bin
is already in the PATH, installed Homebrew apps just work!
</p><p>
Homebrew uses Ruby to manage its packages and functions, but it doesn't
require any programming knowledge to use. And the installation procedure
is literally a copy/paste on the command line. If you use OS X, but you
wish you could install packages as easily as in Linux, give Homebrew a
try: <a href="http://brew.sh" target="_self">brew.sh</a>.

<h2 class="title">Many Drives, One Folder</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #250, February 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
RAID is awesome, and LVM is incredibly powerful, but they add a
layer of complexity to the underlying hard drives. Yes, that complexity
comes with many benefits, but if you just want to spread your files
across multiple storage locations, there's a much easier way.
</p><p>
The mhddfs program is a userspace application that creates a virtual
mountpoint. Using standard drives (USB, network, RAID, whatever), it
concatenates the storage into a single volume. When you write files to
the virtual volume, it just saves them to the underlying drives until
one of them fills up, then it moves to the next. Looking at the virtual
mountpoint, you can't tell where one drive ends and the next starts,
but because mhddfs writes directly to the underlying drives, you easily
can look at them (and even remove them!) to see the individual file locations.
</p><p>
There's no RAID involved, there's no striping or mirroring, there's simply
a single virtual mountpoint that shows the contents of all your drives
in a single folder. It's a simple concept, but incredibly convenient if
you need to have a single view of all your data spread across multiple
drives. (See Figure 1 for a visual representation of the system in action,
and Figure 2 to see it in use.)

</p></div></div><p>
Although mhddfs might be simple, it's incredibly useful. In fact, we found
it so ingenious, we gave it this month's Editors' Choice award. You 
probably can install it from your distribution's repositories, but if not,
visit the home page at <a href="http://mhddfs.uvw.ru" target="_self">mhddfs.uvw.ru</a>. (The page is in Russian,
but an English version is available.)
