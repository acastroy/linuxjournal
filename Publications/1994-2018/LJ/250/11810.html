Cloud Computing Basics Article</h4><p>
Thank you very much for the article &ldquo;Cloud Computing Basics&mdash;Platform as a
Service (PaaS)&rdquo; from Mitesh Soni in the February 2014 issue of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>.
</p><p>
I'm a PhD student, and my work is about security models for PaaS, so this text
was very useful reading.

Ideal Backups with zbackup&mdash;Data Integrity?</h4><p>
I very much enjoyed David Barton's article &ldquo;Ideal Backups with zbackup&rdquo;
in the November 2014 
issue. 
</p><p>
One of the main concerns I have (which is mentioned in the article) is how to
mitigate data corruption to which the deduplicated data store of a zbackup is
particularly vulnerable. 
</p><p>
The author hints that the filesystem snapshots can be used to help but is not really
explicit as to his methods. I was wondering if he would be willing provide
some more detail on that point. 
</p><p>
I could envision snapshotting the backup volume every once in a while to
basically do a &ldquo;full&rdquo; backup, but these snapshots would have to be replicated to
other machines for it to really be worthwhile. Is this what the author was
hinting at, or is there another technique I'm missing here?
</p><p>
Another partial solution, as the author suggests, might be to <tt  >rsync
--ignore-existing</tt> (and also maybe <tt  >-c</tt>) the zbackup data store when replicating
it offsite. This would prevent a corrupted store from being blindly over
written across offsite media. Combined with regular restoration tests, this
might be sufficient for some workflows. 
</p><p>
Any further insight that I might be missing would be much appreciated.

Dr Hjkl Feedback</h4><p>
As a Vim fanatic myself, I was excited to see Kyle Rankin's article Dr Hjkl
in the
December 2014 issue. But I was shocked after reading it. All the command-line
shortcuts you listed are actually bash/readline <span   class="emphasis"><em>Emacs</em></span>
shortcuts (<span   class="emphasis"><em>gasp</em></span>)!
Try adding the following to ~/.inputrc:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set editing-mode vi
</pre>
</p><p>
Now a lot of your Vim favorites&mdash;^, $, w, f and so on&mdash;work verbatim! So all the
Vim muscle memory you've acquired is directly applicable in Bash.
</p><p>
What's more, .inputrc is actually a config file for the GNU readline library,
not Bash. Bash is only one of the many consumers of readline&mdash;you'll have the
same vi keybindings in gdb, pdb, database shells and may other CLI
applications.
</p><p>
The only caveat is that Bash won't show you when you're in insert vs. normal
mode like Vim will. I tend to press Esc (or Ctrl-[) when in doubt.
</p><p>
Also, if you happen to be on OS X, be aware that some BSD applications use the
editline library instead of readline, so you'll want to <tt  >echo "bind -v" &gt;&gt;
~/.editrc</tt>.
</p><p>
Thanks to you and all the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> team for all the great articles!

Regarding <tt  >find</tt>, <tt  >xargs</tt> and Spaces</h4><p>
In Dave Taylor's article &ldquo;Power Shell History and the find
Command&rdquo; in the December 2014 issue, he wrote:
&ldquo;Next time, I'll talk about the <tt  >find|xargs</tt> command pipe pair
and the substantial problem with files and directories that contain
spaces.&rdquo;
</p><p>
There is another, in my view even more severe, problem with typical uses of
&ldquo;find | xargs&rdquo;. The <tt  >xargs</tt> command
(except in the <tt  >xargs -0</tt> case) parses for
matching single and double quotes. So if an incoming filename contains an
odd number of such characters, the <tt  >xargs</tt> command will fail.
</p><p>
For example, in an empty test directory, execute the following commands:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
touch a 'b"c' d
find . -print | xargs ls -ltd
</pre>
</p><p>
The result will be the following error and failure with exit by
<tt  >xargs</tt>:
 
<pre     class="programlisting">
xargs: unmatched double quote; by default quotes are \
special to xargs unless you use the -0 option
</pre>
</p><p>
Both the space issue, and this quote issue, make the typical use of this
otherwise quite useful pipe <span   class="emphasis"><em>unacceptable</em></span> in production shell scripts, in
my view, and likely present a serious security risk, if a root-enabled script
uses &ldquo;find | xargs&rdquo; over a portion of the filesystem space in which
non-root tasks can create files (almost anywhere).
</p><p>
Sometime ago, I wrote a small wrapper for <tt  >xargs</tt> that has served me well,
and that always invokes <tt  >xargs</tt> with the <tt  >-0</tt> (minus zero, for nul separator)
argument, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> safe and reliable form of
<tt  >xargs</tt>.
</p><p>
In my view, the initial <tt  >xargs</tt> command-line interface options and design
(dating back to at least Western Electric's UNIX System V, January 1983,
the oldest UNIX manual I still possess) are irreparably flawed and should
<span   class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> be used in production code. The only safe
<tt  >xargs</tt> option, <tt  >-0</tt>, was
added later in the history of <tt  >xargs</tt>, and it is not in the System V variant.
</p><p>
You can find a copy of my &ldquo;x.c&rdquo; program at <a href="http://pauljackson.us/x.c" target="_self">pauljackson.us/x.c</a> available
under the GPLv2 license. It might be worth recommending to your readers.
</p><p>
The <tt  >x</tt> command compiled from &ldquo;x.c&rdquo; is used
exactly like <tt  >xargs</tt>,
except that the incoming filename stream from find must be
newline-separated, the natural <tt  >find</tt> default. Instead of saying

<pre     class="programlisting">
find ... | xargs ...
</pre>
</p><p>
rather say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
find ... | x ...
</pre>
</p><p>
So, for example, the test case above that failed using
<tt  >xargs</tt> works fine
using <tt  >x</tt>.
</p><p>
My <tt  >x</tt> command does still have the same limitations as the underlying
<tt  >xargs</tt> command regarding multibyte language locales for filenames,
plus the problem with not correctly handling the nul to newline conversion.
It is useful only in single-byte ASCII-like locales, so far as I know.

Paul Jackson  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span> Thanks for your thoughtful note. I am always aware of the lurking horror of
weird characters in filenames, but there's a balance because part of what
makes the shell a great learning environment for scripting and programming is
that it's simple and straightforward. Many shell scripts could be more
robust and bulletproof if written as C programs or Perl scripts, and in some
instances, that's critical. In other instances, however, simplicity and an
understanding of how Linux works, and the UNIX underpinnings, is more
important.
</p><p>
And really, how often do you find filenames in your Linux system that have a
single or double quote as part of the filename?

</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Paul Jackson replies:</b></span> I have lots of such
filenames on my Linux disks, as they include some
Windows filesystems, which run inside VirtualBox emulators.
</p><p>
But the more important fact is that <tt  >xargs</tt> in any form, except the
<tt  >xargs -0</tt>
form (minus zero, for nul-separated) is <span   class="emphasis"><em>dangerous</em></span> in
any root-enabled script,
if fed paths from a <tt  >find</tt> command over any portion of a filesystem that
non-root processes can write, as they can construct, deliberately, filenames
that will be incorrectly parsed by <tt  >xargs</tt>.

Readers' Choice Awards Request</h4><p>
As I read through the Readers' Choice Awards 2014 (in the December 2014
issue), I was looking for and hoping
to see a category for best IDE, since many, or most readers probably also
are programmers. Would you consider Best IDE as a category in the future?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Joe Farkas  <br><br>
</p><p>
Absolutely. In our attempt to streamline the categories, &ldquo;Best
IDE&rdquo; ended
up on the cutting-room floor. If it's something folks still are interested
in, we can certainly add it back next year. Thanks for the
feedback, and if you think there are other categories we should be
including, please send e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>.&mdash;Shawn Powers

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> App on Kindle Fire HDX 8.9" Tablet</h4><p>
I found how to increase the text size of the articles in the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> app
on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9" tablet, but how can I increase the text size of the
table of contents?

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Mike   <br><br>
</p><p>
I don't actually have a Kindle Fire, but if the font size doesn't increase
on the table of contents using the same method to increase the font size
elsewhere, maybe it's not supported in the device. I think it would be
worth contacting Amazon's tech support to find out.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Index to Past Articles?</h4><p>
Your back issues contain a vast wealth of information, much of which is still
relevant.
Do you ever publish an index to past articles?

The annual DVD (see <a href="http://lj.mybigcommerce.com/linux-journal-archive-dvd-1994-2014" target="_self">lj.mybigcommerce.com/linux-journal-archive-dvd-1994-2014</a>) contains every issue ever published, and as such is fairly
popular for that very reason. It's a convenient way to read the archived
information as well, since looking at back issues isn't quite the same as browsing
through a new one.&mdash;Shawn Powers
