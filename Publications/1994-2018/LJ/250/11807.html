Time to get your gambling on as Dave implements the simple betting card game
Acey-Deucey.

I've been looking at the fundamentals of Bash shell script writing and
programming in my past few articles, so it's time to get back to some game coding.
In this article, I'm writing about a simple card game called Acey-Deucey.
You might have played this with your kids&mdash;it's a really simple betting
game popular with people who don't get poker (mostly just kidding there).
</p><p>
The idea is easy. The dealer flips up two cards, one on each side of the (face
down) deck, then players bet on whether the next card to be flipped up is going
to be numerically between the two exposed cards.
</p><p>
For example, if I flipped up a 6 of diamonds and a jack of hearts, you would
then bet on whether the next card would be in the range of 7&ndash;10. Suit
doesn't matter; it's all about rank.
</p><p>
This means, yes, you can do the math easily enough. If you have the entire
deck available each time, the chance of any given card coming up is 1/52. Suit
doesn't matter, so each card rank has a 1/13 chance of being chosen. In the
above example, 7&ndash;10 is four possible winning ranks, so the chances are 4/13 or
30%.
</p><p>
But this isn't a math game, so I apologize for the slight sidetrack! This
is a programming problem, and it starts where all card games start, with
simulating a deck of cards.
</p><p>
To make things interesting, I'm going to approach the problem by having two
decks, one sorted one unsorted. The &ldquo;shuffle&rdquo; then randomly selects
from the sorted deck and adds it to the unsorted (that is, shuffled) deck. Then
cards can be &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; from the unsorted/shuffled deck sequentially, a
simulation that adds a bit of arguably unnecessary computation, but lets us
debug by previewing the top cards on the deck and so on. It also opens up the
possibility of cheating, but that's another story entirely.
</p><p>
To start, let's create the sorted deck, modeling it as an array:

<pre     class="programlisting">
card=1
while [ $card -le 52 ]       # 52 cards in a deck
do
  deck[$card]=$card
  card=$(( $card + 1 ))
done
</pre>
</p><p>
To create the shuffled deck&mdash;herein called
&ldquo;newdeck&rdquo;&mdash;we'll need to have a new function
<tt  >pickCard</tt> that randomly tries to grab a
card out of the ordered deck. Note that this has some nuances, but let's
start with the base code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
while [ $errcount -lt $threshold ]
do
  randomcard=$(( ( $RANDOM % 52 ) + 1 ))
  errcount=$(( $errcount + 1 ))

  if [ ${deck[$randomcard]} -ne 0 ] ; then
    picked=${deck[$randomcard]}
    deck[$picked]=0         # picked, remove it
    return $picked
  fi
done
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >threshold</tt> variable is because although the first 80% of card picks
are easy, the last few end up problematic, because we could, for example, end up
with an array of 51 empty slots and one available card that we're trying to
find with random selections. So <tt  >threshold</tt> limits the number of random
picks made. If we don't get a valid card within that count, the script will
drop down to the less random sequential search for an available card:

<pre     class="programlisting">
randomcard=1
while [ ${newdeck[$randomcard]} -eq 0 ]
 do
    randomcard=$(( $randomcard + 1 ))
 done
 picked=$randomcard
 deck[$picked]=0             # picked, remove it
 return $picked
</pre>
</p><p>
It's not so glamorous, but it's functional, and really, by the time we hit this code,
we're down to the last half-dozen cards in the deck anyway, and a lack of
randomness is unlikely to be noticed, certainly not in Acey-Deucey where we use
the entire deck each time we play.
</p><p>
Now that we have a card picking function, we can create the shuffle deck
function, which instantiates the array <tt  >newdeck</tt> with a randomly chosen
ordering of the sorted cards in <tt  >deck</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
while [ $count -le 52 ]
do
  pickCard
  newdeck[$count]=$picked
  count=$(( $count + 1 ))
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Still with me? These functions are mnemonically named
<tt  >initializeDeck</tt>,
<tt  >shuffleDeck</tt> and <tt  >pickCard</tt>, meaning that all we need to do to be ready to start
writing some game playing code is this sequence:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
initializeDeck
shuffleDeck
</pre>
</p><p>
Nice. Now the first step of the actual game is to pick those first two cards,
right? Right!
</p><p>
The core code is straightforward, but we have to deal with the fact that
numerically we're representing a king as a rank of zero (so that all the
other rank cards are their own value). So we need to keep fixing that each time
a card is picked:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function dealCards
{
    # Acey Deucey has two cards flipped up...

    card1=${newdeck[1]}      # since deck is shuffled, we take
    card2=${newdeck[2]}      # the top two cards from the deck
    card3=${newdeck[3]}      # and pick card #3 secretly

    rank1=$(( $card1 % 13 ))     # get the rank values
    rank2=$(( $card2 % 13 ))     # to make subsequent
    rank3=$(( $card3 % 13 ))     # calculations easy

    # fix to make the king, default rank = 0, have rank = 13

    if [ $rank1 -eq 0 ] ; then
      rank1=13;
    fi
    if [ $rank2 -eq 0 ] ; then
      rank2=13;
    fi
    if [ $rank3 -eq 0 ] ; then
      rank3=13;
    fi

    # now organize them so that card1 is always lower value 
    # than card2

    if [ $rank1 -gt $rank2 ] ; then
      temp=$card1; card1=$card2; card2=$temp
      temp=$rank1; rank1=$rank2; rank2=$temp
    fi

    showCard $card1 ; cardname1=$cardname
    showCard $card2 ; cardname2=$cardname

    showCard $card3 ; cardname3=$cardname    
    echo "I've dealt:"
    echo "   $cardname1" ; echo "   $cardname2"
}
</pre>
</p><p>
There's a lot going on in that particular function, but don't be too
bewildered, the main work is here in these two lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
card1=${newdeck[1]}     
rank1=$(( $card1 % 13 ))    
</pre>
</p><p>
On first glance, the omission of a <tt  >$RANDOM</tt> might cause anxiety, but remember
we've already created the shuffled deck as <tt  >newdeck[]</tt> in
the script. Now we
can just grab the top card and save it as <tt  >$card1</tt>, then calculate its rank by
doing the old mod 13 trick. This, of course, is why a king with a value of 13 ends up
being a zero, so we need to fix it a bit later in the function.
</p><p>
The eagle-eyed among you will notice that we've already picked the third
card in this function, so we could actually just say &ldquo;winner!&rdquo; or
&ldquo;loser!&rdquo; immediately, dispensing with the entire betting sequence, but
what's the point in that?
</p><p>
There's one more function that's needed for the playing card library in
the shell, and that's <tt  >showCard</tt>. You can see it referenced above, so
let's have a look. Fundamentally, it's easy: pull the rank and
suit from the card value, then translate each as needed to make the output
pretty.
</p><p>
Here's my shot at that, demonstrating my zeal for case statements:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function showCard
{
   # This uses a div and a mod to figure out suit and rank, though
   # in this game only rank matters. Still, presentation is
   # important too, so this helps make things pretty.

   card=$1

   if [ $card -lt 1 -o $card -gt 52 ] ; then
     echo "Bad card value: $card"
     exit 1
   fi

   # div and mod. See, all that math in school wasn't wasted!

   suit="$(( ( ( $card - 1) / 13 ) + 1))"
   rank="$(( $card % 13))"

   case $suit in
     1 ) suit="Hearts"    ;;
     2 ) suit="Clubs"    ;;
     3 ) suit="Spades"   ;;
     4 ) suit="Diamonds" ;;
     * ) echo "Bad suit value: $suit"; exit 1
   esac

   case $rank in
     0 ) rank="King"    ;;
     1 ) rank="Ace"     ;;
     11) rank="Jack"    ;;
     12) rank="Queen"   ;;
   esac

   cardname="$rank of $suit"
}
</pre>
</p><p>
You also could do the same thing, probably quicker, by setting up an array of
rank names and an array of suit names, but that can be your version of the
code. Me? I like case statements.
</p><p>
Now we have everything we need for the basic game, but I'm going to hold
off on the overall game logic and some demonstrations of the game in play until
my next article.
