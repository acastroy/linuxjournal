An introduction to SQL injections and their impact on a popular content
management system, and recommendations to mitigate 
SQL injection attacks against Web applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13aa580.0x14a21f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Drupal is a very widely used open-source content management system.
It initially was released in 2001, and recent statistics show Drupal
as the third-most popular content management system, with just less than
800,000 Web sites utilizing Drupal as a content management system.
</p><p>
Drupal is written in PHP, and it is architected to use a database back end
to store Web site content and settings, whether a full-fledged database
management system (such as MySQL) or an embedded DBMS (such as SQLite).
In recent versions, Drupal has provided a database abstraction layer in
order to facilitate the use of any of a number of database management
systems to support a given Drupal installation. Database abstraction
layers provide a consistent programming interface that can be used to
communicate with a variety of database systems without development of code
specific to a given database management system. 
</p><p>
Due to vulnerabilities
in the database abstraction layer introduced in version 7 of Drupal,
Drupal 7 prior to version 7.32 was vulnerable to an SQL injection
attack.
This article provides an introduction to SQL injection attacks, an
examination of the Drupageddon vulnerability specifically and an explanation
of a number of potential defenses against SQL injection attacks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13aa580.0x14a24b8"></a>
SQL Injection</h2></div></div><p>
SQL injection is an attack methodology in which malicious SQL code is
included in user input, leading to the execution of said SQL code as part
of SQL statements used by an application. SQL injection attacks can
lead to privilege bypass and/or escalation, disclosure of confidential
information and corruption of database information, among other effects.
</p><p>
Command injection attacks, such as SQL injection, routinely place at
or near the top of the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)
Top Ten List of Web application security risks. SQL injection attacks
are likely the most well-known type of command injection attacks, but
injection attacks can occur any time data is supplied to an interpreter
by an application. The recent Bash vulnerability known as Shellshock
is an example of a command injection attack that is not related to
SQL injection.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13aa580.0x14a2618"></a>
SQL Injection Example</h2></div></div><p>
An example SQL injection attack starts with code utilizing an SQL
statement, such as:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$db_statement = "SELECT COUNT(1) FROM `users` WHERE 
 &#8618;`username` = '$username' AND `password` ='$password'";
</pre>
</p><p>
In an SQL injection attack against code such as this, the attacker supplies
input, such as the following, to the application:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$username = "badUser";
$password = "' OR '1'='1";
</pre>
</p><p>
Using this example, the SQL statement executed becomes the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT COUNT (1) FROM `users` WHERE `username`='badUser' 
 &#8618;AND `password`='' OR '1'='1';
</pre>
</p><p>
In the above example, this results in returning a count of all rows in the
&ldquo;users&rdquo; table, regardless of the user name or password supplied, since the
conditional <tt  >'1'='1'</tt> always returns as true. If the query shown in this
example is used for authentication purposes, the example SQL injection
attack has just bypassed the authentication process for the application
in question.
</p><p>
SQL injection attacks, and other command injection attacks in general,
represent a significant risk for Web applications. Exploitation of SQL
injection vulnerabilities is relatively easy for an attacker to perform,
and both the attack itself and searches for vulnerable code are easily
automated. Additionally, the impact of SQL injection attacks is quite
often very severe, as is seen in the authentication example above,
as well as in the specific example of Drupageddon.

Drupageddon</h2></div></div><p>
The Drupageddon vulnerability officially was discovered by SektionEins
GmbH while the company was performing a security audit for a customer that
was utilizing Drupal as a content management system. SektionEins GmbH reported the vulnerability
to Drupal developers on September 16,
2014. The vulnerability was disclosed publicly by Drupal on October
15, 2014, using the Drupal advisory identifier DRUPAL-SA-CORE-2014-005
and the CVE identifier CVE-2014-3704. The public disclosure included
a description of the vulnerability, as well as recommendations for
vulnerability mitigation. The primary recommendation for mitigation
of this vulnerability was an immediate upgrade to Drupal version 7.32.
For administrators of Web sites that could not be upgraded to
Drupal version 7.32 immediately, a patch was provided to resolve the SQL injection
vulnerability. 
</p><p>
SektionEins nicknamed this vulnerability Drupageddon due to the potential impact of
exploitation of this vulnerability upon Drupal-based Web sites. (Note:
in a number of instances in the press, this vulnerability was referred to
as &ldquo;Drupalgeddon&rdquo;, which is inaccurate. The term
&ldquo;Drupalgeddon&rdquo; refers to a
diagnostic tool intended to be used in order to diagnose Drupal instances
that may have been compromised due to the Drupageddon vulnerability.)
</p><p>
Successful exploitation
of this attack could result in execution of arbitrary PHP commands,
privilege escalation, installation of system backdoors and other
exploits. Additionally, exploitation of this vulnerability did not
require any sort of successful authentication to the target Drupal
instance(s) prior to exploitation. 
</p><p>
It was estimated that within several
hours of the announcement of the Drupageddon vulnerability, active
and automated exploits for this vulnerability were being utilized by
attackers to compromise Drupal-based Web sites. 
</p><p>
On October 29, 2014,
the Drupal Security Team released advisory identifier DRUPAL-PSA-2014-003.
This advisory informed administrators of Drupal-based Web sites that all
Drupal-based Web sites utilizing vulnerable versions of Drupal should
be considered compromised if they were not patched/upgraded before
2300 UTC on October 15, 2014 (seven hours following the initial announcement
of the vulnerability in SA-CORE-2014-005).
</p><p>
In the case of the Drupageddon vulnerability, the database abstraction
layer provided by Drupal included a function called
<tt  >expandArguments</tt>
that was used in order to expand arrays that provide
arguments to SQL queries utilized in supporting the Drupal installation.
Due to the way this function was written, supplying an array with keys
(rather than an array with no keys) as input to the function could be
used in order to perform an SQL injection attack.
</p><p>
A potential (non-malicious) use of the <tt  >expandArguments</tt> function would
be as follows:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$query = "SELECT COUNT(1) FROM `users` WHERE `id` IN (:userids)"; 
$args = [ 'userids' =&gt; [ 1, 2, 3, ] ]; 
$db-&gt;expandArguments($query, $args);
</pre>
</p><p>
This would result in the following SQL statement:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT COUNT(1) FROM `users` WHERE `id` IN 
 &#8618;(:userids_0, :userids_1, :userids_2);
</pre>
</p><p>
However, by supplying a carefully crafted argument array, an attacker
could perform an SQL injection attack:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$query = "SELECT COUNT(1) FROM `users` WHERE `id` 
 &#8618;IN (:userids)";
$args = [ 'userids' =&gt; [ '0); DROP TABLE 
 &#8618;importantInformation; --' =&gt; 1 ], ];
$db-&gt;expandArguments($query, $args);
</pre>
</p><p>
This would result in the following SQL statement:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT COUNT (1) FROM `users` WHERE `id` IN (:userids_0); 
 &#8618;DROP TABLE importantInformation; --)
</pre>
</p><p>
The -- marks the remainder of the line as an SQL comment, avoiding the
syntax error due to the unmatched right parenthesis. The results of
the execution of a malicious query such as this obviously could be
catastrophic.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13aa580.0x14a3328"></a>
Recommendations</h2></div></div><p>
A number of strategies can be used to
minimize the risk of SQL command injection attacks. These include input
sanitization and whitelisting, use of parameterized queries and defense
in depth.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Input Sanitization and Whitelisting:</b></span>
</p><p>
One strategy that can be used for prevention of SQL injection attacks
is the sanitization and whitelisting of user input. This strategy
is implemented by analyzing both expected or valid input that will be
provided by users as well as input that may be provided by attackers
attempting to compromise your Web-based application. Following this
initial analysis, sanitization code will need to be added in order
to remove or escape any harmful/unwanted input by a user prior
to use of said input in any database queries. In the case of the SQL
injection example given earlier in this article, there are two potential
sanitization and whitelisting processes that could be utilized.
</p><p>
In the SQL injection example given earlier, let's assume you 
previously have told users of the Web application that valid characters
for user names are a&ndash;z, A&ndash;Z, 0&ndash;9 and &ldquo;.&rdquo;. This would represent an
excellent opportunity for the use of whitelist-based input validation.
In this method of input validation, you would construct a whitelist of
allowed characters for the user input and would allow only user input
limited to those characters to be passed to the database for processing.
In this case, you either would discard any characters provided by users
as their user name aside from a&ndash;z, A&ndash;Z, 0&ndash;9 and
&ldquo;.&rdquo;, or you simply
would refuse to perform any processing following user input that includes any
characters that are not included in your whitelist of allowed characters.
Using this example, an attack in which the following is provided as
input for the <tt  >username</tt> value:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$username = "x'; DROP TABLE importantInformation; 
 &#8618;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'badUser'";
$password = "Test";
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13aa580.0x14a36f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
either would be refused or would be sanitized (if inappropriate
characters are discarded) to the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$username = "xDROPTABLEimportantInformation
&#8618;SELECTFROMusersWHEREusernamebadUser";
</pre>
</p><p>
If sanitization is used in this example, this would result in the
following SQL statement being executed:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT COUNT(1) FROM `users` WHERE `username`=
&#8618;'xDROPTABLEimportantInformationSELECTFROMusersWHEREusernamebadUser' 
 &#8618;AND `password`='Test';
</pre>
</p><p>
Without sanitization, the following SQL statements would be executed:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT COUNT(1) FROM users WHERE username='$username = 
 &#8618;"x'; DROP TABLE importantInformation; SELECT COUNT(1) 
 &#8618;FROM users WHERE username = 'badUser' AND password = Test';
</pre>
</p><p>
This results in two <tt  >SELECT</tt> statements being executed, and also results
in the deletion of the <tt  >importantInformation</tt> table.
</p><p>
(Note: this SQL example also represents other security problems in that
passwords in the database appear to be stored in plain text. However,
that is outside the scope of this article, and encryption of passwords
would have no impact on vulnerability to SQL injection attacks.)
</p><p>
In the user authentication example, additional processing is needed in
order to handle the password provided by the user, however. Assuming
that you allow all keyboard characters in an effort to allow for as
complex passwords as possible, you cannot simply refuse password input
containing potentially dangerous characters. In this case, you will want
to sanitize user input by escaping said input prior to query processing.
In this example, the following input:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$username = "badUser";
$password = "' OR '1'='1";
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13aa580.0x14a3c70"></a></h2></div></div><p>
would become escaped to the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$username = "badUser";
$password = "\' OR \'1\'=\'1";
</pre>
</p><p>
This then would result in the following SQL statement being executed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT COUNT (1) FROM users WHERE username='badUser' 
 &#8618;AND password='\' OR \'1\'=\'1';
</pre>
</p><p>
This version of the SQL statement would result in returning a count of
the number of rows in the users table where the contents of the user name
field is equal to the string &ldquo;badUser&rdquo;, and the contents of the password
field are equal to the literal string &ldquo;' OR '1'='1&rdquo; (that is, the attack
has been blocked).
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Use of Parameterized Queries</b></span>
</p><p>
Another strategy for guarding against
SQL injection is the use of parameterized queries. With 
parameterized queries, SQL statements are predefined and stored on the
database server with placeholders representing the parameters that will
be utilized in the query. When it comes time for the SQL statement(s)
in question to be executed, relevant user input is added to the queries
prior to execution, with any relevant escaping of user input being
handled automatically by the database server.
</p><p>
In the user authentication example shown previously, the parameterized
version of the query would resemble something like the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=?un? AND password=?pw?;
</pre>
</p><p>
When it comes time for the SQL statement to be executed, the database
management system performs any escaping needed for the parameter(s)
in question, and the SQL statement then is executed with the escaped
parameter(s) taking the place of the placeholders.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Defense in Depth:</b></span>
</p><p>
At a very high level, the best plan for preventing SQL injection
attacks is an overall strategy of defense in depth. This approach relies
on deploying a number of different defense mechanisms simultaneously,
with the overall strategy being that if an attacker is able to defeat one
of the defense mechanisms, the other defense mechanisms still will be in
place and still will be able to defend against/detect attempted attacks.
In the example of Drupageddon, the following parallel defense strategies
in addition to the previously mentioned defense strategies would have
helped to minimize the risk of system compromise due to SQL injection.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
System and Application Updates:</em></span>
Keeping systems and applications current with updates is one of the
first lines of defense that should be implemented by individuals and
organizations in order to prevent system and application compromises.
In the case of Drupageddon, either upgrading to Drupal version 7.32 or
installing the patch provided by Drupal developers would have 
mitigated against the Drupageddon vulnerability immediately. Although the Drupageddon
vulnerability existed since 2011, there is no evidence of any significant
exploitation of the vulnerability until after the public disclosure of
Drupageddon by SektionEins.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Intrusion Detection Systems:</em></span>
Most current intrusion detection systems include functionality to
detect attempted SQL injection attacks. These systems can provide early
warnings of attempted SQL injection attacks, and if paired with intrusion
prevention functionality, often can prevent the attacks from occurring.
</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Limitation of Database Privileges:</em></span>
Privileges of database users used for applications should be limited
to as restrictive a set of privileges as possible that will allow for
the performance of required database activities in order to support the
functionality of the application. For instance, if the only database
activities that are required for the application in question are reads
from the database, consider limiting the database account used by the
application to a read-only account. This will not prevent SQL injection
attacks aimed at inappropriate access to information, but it will prevent
SQL injection attacks that are intended to cause unauthorized changes
to the database.
</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
System and Application Monitoring:</em></span>
Although system and application logging and monitoring will not, in and
of themselves, prevent an SQL injection attack from occurring, they will
help in the process of detecting attempted attacks. Additionally, use
of functionality like file integrity monitoring can help detect
the results of system compromises due to SQL injection attacks.
</p></li><li><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
Code Audits:</em></span>
Auditing of source code utilized in an application can help identify
security vulnerabilities in the application in question. In fact, the
Drupageddon vulnerability was discovered due to a source code audit that
was performed against the Drupal code base. Source code audits 
typically should be performed by a party other than those responsible for
the creation of the source code in question, as this provides a fresh
perspective on the source code. Unfortunately, source code audits usually are
very expensive and time-consuming.
