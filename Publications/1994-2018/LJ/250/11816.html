A new Linux distro for everybody's everythings.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2393580.0x248b300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
UBOS is a new Linux distro that
I like for two reasons. One is that it works toward making it easy for muggles
to set up their own fully independent personal home servers with little or no
help from wizards. The other is that it comes from my friend Johannes Ernst.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11816f1.large.jpg"><img src="11816f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
It's in beta at the time of this writing, and it runs on PCs, Raspberry Pi models B and B+,
and on Macs in VirtualBox. It's been tested with ownCloud, Known, WordPress,
Mediawiki, Selfoss, Shaarli and Jenkins and plugins for a number of those.
</p><p>
Says Johannes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
My goal is to make the administration of personal servers 10x
easier for users, and also to make it much easier for developers to create
&ldquo;personal data&rdquo; Web applications that don't spy on us and get them deployed.
Over time, we will get UBOS to as many pieces of hardware as possible, and
pre-install lots of &ldquo;personal data&rdquo;-related middleware. We're already working
with two Internet of Things projects to get UBOS to be the OS they run as the
default on their hardware. Imagine if all the IoT products you bought were
&ldquo;indie&rdquo; and not tied to some corporate overlord's take-over-the-world
strategy? To do that, we need to make administration easier.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Here are some of the ways that's done:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Single-command deployment of Web apps</b></span>, with automatic database
provisioning, Web server configuration and so on&mdash;including SSL setup.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Full virtual hosting</b></span>&mdash;for example, you can run two instances of WordPress
with different plugins and one of ownCloud at
http://personal.example.com/blog, http://home.example.com/news and
http://home.example.net/owncloud on the same host.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Single-command undeployment</b></span>.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Single-command full system upgrade</b></span>, which backs up all your data, upgrades
all code from the operating system over middleware to applications, runs
whatever data migrations might be necessary and redeploys all your apps.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Single-command backup and restore</b></span> of all or part of the apps installed on
the same host.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Phil Windley is the creator of picos (persistent compute objects, or
virtual things) and CloudOS (an operating system for picos, the subject of
&ldquo;The First Personal Platform&mdash;for Everything&rdquo; in our
October 2013
issue), and my guru on what I'll call the Internet of Personal Things. When
I asked him for his take on UBOS, he wrote this back:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
There's a healthy sorting out happening in the &ldquo;personal
cloud&rdquo; space, around
devices, sensors and other &ldquo;things&rdquo; that people will
use&mdash;and around
personal control and ownership as well. Picos/CloudOS are about providing
specific services in a lightweight way for things that are all under a user's
control. Picos allow personal data to remain personal. So the first way picos
and systems like UBOS are related is in the heads of people realizing they
need to be in control of everything in their life: words, personal data,
things or whatever.
</p><p>
More technically, UBOS and picos could interact in the following ways:
</p><p>
1) You could host your picos on UBOS on your own server.
</p><p>
2) You could monitor and control them from such a platform.
</p><p>
3) UBOS would be a great place to run your personal (UMA-based?)
authorization server.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
To unpack this the rest of the way, I interviewed Johannes. 
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: According to DistroWatch, there are hundreds of Linux distros already. Why
one more?</em></span>
</p><p>
JE: There is a hole in the market, and it's at home. UBOS focuses on making
the administration of home servers much simpler, which is not something most
distros pay much attention to.
</p><p>
The timing is also right. First, hardware has become cheap and powerful enough
to run Web servers at home. Many people now keep their calendars, personal
photos and other important private data away from the major cloud providers,
because they would rather store it on hardware they have control over. Second,
developers of cool IoT projects almost always need a Web server, so they can
open their garage door, set their thermostat or water their plants over the
Web. While many of those are $35 Raspberry Pis, they still require the same
amount of maintenance as any big Linux server used for business purposes.
</p><p>
With UBOS, we set out to make administration of these kinds of
personally owned servers at least 10x faster and easier, so more people can
run their own servers at home, build more cool IoT projects and keep their
data private and at home, without turning home server maintenance into a
full-time job.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: &ldquo;10 times&rdquo; faster system administration is a big claim. How do you back
this up?</em></span>
</p><p>
JE: Think of what you need to do to install a Web app, such as ownCloud, on your
server. This usually involves:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Finding and downloading a tar file.
</p></li><li><p>
Full virtual hosting. For example, you can run two instances of WordPress
with different plugins and one of ownCloud at
http://personal.example.com/blog, http://home.example.com/news and
http://home.example.com/owncloud.
</p></li><li><p>
Provisioning a MySQL database.
</p></li><li><p>
Editing application configuration files and fixing permissions.
</p></li><li><p>
Setting up logging.
</p></li><li><p>
Restarting servers and so on.
Installation of a single app can easily take a few hours and usually
requires real Linux admin knowledge. We think it should be easier, so more
people can do it, faster, and more reliably.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
In UBOS, you say <tt  >sudo ubos-admin createsite</tt>. UBOS will ask you a few
questions, like the desired virtual hostname or whether you want SSL, and
then UBOS does all these steps for you. Total time consumed: maybe a minute.
</p><p>
This already works for a number of Web apps, including ownCloud, WordPress,
Mediawiki, Selfoss, Shaarli, Known and even Jenkins where UBOS automatically
sets up an Apache reverse proxy to Tomcat.
</p><p>
When it is time to upgrade, server administration is even more time-consuming,
and don't we all want to keep our Web sites patched for security reasons! You
need to do all of the above, but also back up data before (don't forget any
place the app might have written valuable files!), and perhaps manually run
data migrations. Some apps like WordPress have made it easy, but most have
not. In UBOS, it's simply: <tt  >sudo ubos-admin update</tt>. And you can relax while
UBOS does all of the above, for all the apps you have installed at
all of the virtual hosts on your personal server.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: What changes did you need to make to the Web apps you list so they could
be administered by UBOS?</em></span>
</p><p>
JE: So far, we haven't had to fork any of them, so it's been pleasantly
simple. It's mostly adding some JSON metadata to the application package and
parameterizing configuration files so UBOS can &ldquo;edit&rdquo; them correctly.
Sometimes some additional scripts are required, but rarely. All the current
apps are on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/indiebox" target="_self">https://github.com/indiebox</a>.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Wasn't one of the existing distros close to being what you want to give
the world with UBOS?</em></span>
</p><p>
JE: UBOS is a derivative of Arch Linux, which we
rely on heavily. You can
think of UBOS as a subset of Arch, plus UBOS administration tools and the
additional metadata and conventions required to make ubos-admin work.
</p><p>
We inherit many of the great qualities of Arch&mdash;for example, it is a rolling release
distro, so we never have to impose major upgrades on the user; packages
on Arch are never very much out of date, because we do want to run the latest
and greatest, and the Arch community and its wiki are simply amazing. UBOS
takes many of the Arch packages even without recompiling.
</p><p>
We started out by simply adding our administration packages to Arch, but
because we want to make sure that apps always install correctly and upgrade
correctly, we need to control when upgraded packages are made available to
servers. So it was the needs of the quality assurance process that caused us
to create a new distro with separate repositories.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: How, besides this interview, are you going to attract hackers to jump
in and improve the code?</em></span>
</p><p>
JE: We just published the very first UBOS beta, for x86_64 and the Raspberry
Pi, so we are only at the beginning of this. The next steps are the inevitable
bug fixes, easier networking setup, perhaps more hardware platforms if users
want that and more apps.
</p><p>
But then, we're looking to work with developers of Web applications who want
to make it easier for their users to install their apps, and to developers of
Internet-of-Things hardware who want to make it easier for developers to get
Web applications running and maintained on their hardware. We all have the
same goal here&mdash;make home servers easier&mdash;and we invite anybody who
shares this goal to help make it so.
</p><p>
You might also be a really frustrated home user who's had it with with fixing
/etc/i/forget/what Saturday afternoons and would much rather help fix the
problem once and for all.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: What do you mean by personal servers? I can guess, but I'd rather have you
tell me. And how are these different from personal clouds, stores, lockers and
vaults, except in the sense of where they live?</em></span>
</p><p>
JE: All these, in my mind, describe a different part of mostly the same
elephant. A personal server, for me, is a computer that is primarily accessed
over the network, but it is one that I have root access to and nobody else
does. (Or at least that I can have root access to if I want to, and I can take
away root access from anybody else.) Such a personal server can be a physical
piece of hardware or a virtualized one in the cloud. It's different from a
non-personal server in that I use this server for my own, personal purposes
and for those of my family, but not for setting up a Web site for the general
public.
</p><p>
A personal cloud, a personal data locker or vault would be one kind of use of
that personal server. Another use would be to control one's home appliances.
So many kinds of personal applications have their natural home on a personal
server, because by its very definition, nobody gets to touch the data on that
server other than the owner.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: Why just Web apps?</em></span>
</p><p>
JE: Package managers are great at helping administer most code on a Linux box,
and UBOS heavily relies on pacman. But they are not able to administer Web
apps because they do not (and cannot) help with Web server configuration,
database configuration and so forth. ubos-admin sits on top of the pacman
package manager and adds that additional layer of automation.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: What kind of &ldquo;intelligent Internet of Things devices&rdquo; are you talking
about?</em></span>
</p><p>
JE: There seem to be four types of IoT &ldquo;devices&rdquo; emerging:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Sensors, for example, thermometers, often with very low power
requirements.
</p></li><li><p>
Actuators, for example, relays to switch on something.
</p></li><li><p>
Cloud servers.
</p></li><li><p>
Higher-powered devices in the home that connect the Internet to the sensors
and the actuators. For many hobbyists, that often is a Raspberry Pi.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
This last category of devices is often powerful enough to run Web
applications. It turns out that for many home IoT applications, there is no
need to run Web applications in the cloud at all. So why not turn these
devices into devices that run the Web apps directly?
</p><p>
This has the added advantage that our personal IoT data stays private in the
home, and can't be abused by a cloud provider.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
DS: What's the end state of the &ldquo;Internet of our own things&rdquo;? Or at least a
state to which <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers can aspire&mdash;and weigh in with some
code and product?</em></span>
</p><p>
JE: As geeks, and as an industry, we have a choice to make here about how we'd
like the Internet of Things to look ten years from now.
</p><p>
There's the &ldquo;NEST way&rdquo;, which is totally closed devices 100% dependent on
being tethered to some corporate overlord. Google in this case. Some people
consider these beautiful-looking devices to be nothing else than surveillance
devices first and thermostats second. I guess they have a point. In any case,
we have no control whatsoever over their functioning and terms of service, nor
what they do with our data.
</p><p>
And there's the user-owned, free/libre, &ldquo;indie&rdquo; way, where
every device is&mdash;at least in principle&mdash;hackable. Where data stays home, or at least
is only shared with anybody because the owner of the device decided that that
is what they wanted to do. Where we can run the code we want on whatever
device we buy or build. Where interoperability is not subject to whether some
big companies love or hate each other this week.
</p><p>
Personally, I'm horrified at the first of these scenarios, and I know many
other geeks are too, because all these great IoT projects keep popping up
everywhere. The next step is to make this all reliable and maintainable enough
that it's not just the geeks who can control their own homes. UBOS is one step
in that direction, but many others are required. In fact, we might need a real
barn-raising effort to together create an &ldquo;Internet of our own
things&rdquo;.
Anybody up for that? I am!
