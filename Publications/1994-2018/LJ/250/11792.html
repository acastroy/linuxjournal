DevAssistant is a tool that helps you easily kick off development,
automate mundane tasks and publish code without hassle.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f41f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you ever have started writing a new piece of software or checked out
someone else's, you certainly know there's a lot more to be done than
just opening the file and starting coding. You need dependencies. You
need the proper directory structure. You need the proper things put on your
$PATH and countless others considerations. To seasoned developers, these are issues that
only somewhat slow them down; for new people, these often are obstacles
that make them give up and try something else altogether. A few of
my team members and I decided we wanted to fix the problem for both of these kinds
of developers. Easier said than done, you think? It depends. About two
years ago, we started discussing concrete ways of solving these small,
frequent and annoying problems, and we've come up with something that
gradually became DevAssistant (usually shortened to DA) today
(<a href="http://www.devassistant.org" target="_self">www.devassistant.org</a>).
</p><p>
What we created is, essentially, a simple but powerful tool that sets
up your entire environment for developing a particular software project
with only a few clicks in a GUI or a single line on the command line,
and that you can extend almost without effort. DevAssistant consists
basically of three things: the main program, which is packaged under
the name devassistant on the Python Package Index and in Fedora; the
scripts called Assistants that implement the particular workflows; and
the DevAssistant Package Index (DAPI), which is where you install the
Assistants from.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f4460"></a>
What Is It Actually Good For?</h2></div></div><p>
This is usually where people start asking questions. Truly, at first
glance, DevAssistant may seem redundant. After all, there's support for
most of these things in IDEs, so that's sorted out already, right? And
dependencies are specified in the package management software for that
particular language, aren't they? Technically, yes. Actually, no. The
main problem with IDEs is the very fact that you actually have to use
them, and by &ldquo;them&rdquo;, I mean only the specific one that supports what you
need. Every single IDE has a ton of neat features, but what about users of
different IDEs? When we designed DevAssistant, we deliberately wanted
to avoid this kind of dependence on a particular development suite,
so that we are able to cater to all users, regardless of whether they
use a particular IDE, a standalone text editor or write machine code
into standard input.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11792f1.large.jpg"><img src="11792f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. DevAssistant's main window&mdash;you can select which Assistant
to run from here (Node.js selected, cursor not visible).
</p></div></div><p>
The other major objection we usually get is that there are dependency
mechanisms already well established across languages, and there's no
reason to have another. That assertion is almost, yet not exactly,
true. There certainly are mechanisms to manage dependencies that are
necessary to run the program or use the library. On the other hand,
there is usually little that can be done if you want to make sure that
you have everything needed to develop the code. And even if there is,
it rarely takes care of settings other than dependencies. What if you
need a working Web server to test your app, open a port in a firewall or set
up SELinux? None of the established systems takes care of such trouble
for you. Furthermore, nobody solves the dependencies for you if you're
not really writing a program&mdash;like writing documentation in Markdown
and wanting to see how your text will look when converted to HTML or
another language.
</p><p>
In addition to all this, there is the question of publishing your
code. Since you're using free/open-source software, we bet that
you want to publish your code as well. To make this easier for you,
DevAssistant is fairly tightly integrated with GitHub, so if you want
to create a new repository and push your sources there, you can do so
without even opening your browser. The same goes for forking existing
repositories. Conventionally, it means this: going into your browser,
logging in, typing the repo's full address, clicking &ldquo;Fork&rdquo;, waiting
for the forking to finish, selecting the address for cloning,
then going into your console and typing <tt  >git clone</tt> and pasting the address.
With DevAssistant (and the Assistant called &ldquo;custom&rdquo;), you run this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
da prepare custom --gh-repo olduser/repo --gh-fork newuser
</pre>
</p><p>
DevAssistant then performs all the steps mentioned above, in a single
command. You can do the exact same thing in the GUI with very few clicks
as well. More specifically, the GUI and the command-line interface both
share the same Assistants that contain instructions and dependencies
specifications, and that are analyzed and carried out by the main
program.
</p><p>
The previous four paragraphs possibly made you think &ldquo;Wouldn't it be
better if beginners learned by setting up everything in the first
place, instead of having DA do it all for them?&rdquo; Of course it would. However,
ask yourself honestly, when you were starting whatever you are doing
now, did you dig deep into each step of the installation instructions and
analyze it thoroughly before moving on? Or did you just stumble your way
through it, having a vague idea of what the instructions meant, impatient
to get to the &ldquo;Hello world!&rdquo; example at the end? We are willing to bet
that nine out of ten cases were the latter, and most developers learned only
much later how the language worked. What our team did was simply build
a tool to lower the learning curve for these developers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f4b40"></a>
Assistants and Workflows</h2></div></div><p>
Let's talk about what you can automate through various Assistants. 
Be aware that at the time of writing of this article, there are two
supported versions of DevAssistant: 0.9.3 and 0.10.0. The first
one is a bug-fix release, which still includes some Assistants in its
core distribution and is available in Fedora 21 by default. To install
Assistants for this version, you need to download and unpack the packages
manually (more on that later). In version 0.10.0, no Assistants are
included, and they can be installed via the command line by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
da pkg install NAME_OF_PACKAGE
</pre>
</p><p>
With Assistants installed, you can run them either from the command-line
interface (CLI) or the GUI. In the CLI, an invocation looks like this (the
example works with the Assistant called &ldquo;python&rdquo;, available on the DAPI):

<pre     class="programlisting">
da create python flask -n my_flask_app
</pre>
</p><p>
The same can be achieved in the GUI by selecting Create
project&rarr;Python&rarr;Flask and typing &ldquo;my\_flask\_app&rdquo; as the project
name. Running this Assistant creates a new Flask Web application named
&ldquo;my\_flask\_app&rdquo;, installs all necessary dependencies, creates the
required directory structure in a directory named like the app itself,
and modifies the boilerplate files to conform to your project (for example, by
changing paths, names and settings). Once DA's run is finished, you 
then can just run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./manage.py runserver
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f4f08"></a></h2></div></div><p>
in the new project's root directory, and you'll have a running Web app
only seconds after launching DA. During the run, basic information is
logged either to the standard output or the log window (depending on
which interface you are using), so you can keep track of what is being
done. If you prefer more verbose feedback or need to figure out
what the problem is if something went wrong, you can select the debug
option and see all the information that either DevAssistant itself or
the shell underneath it outputs.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11792f2.large.jpg"><img src="11792f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Project creation window&mdash;here is where you specify
parameters for the project you want to create.
</p></div></div><p>
Generally speaking, there are four main kinds of Assistants: create,
tweak, prepare and extras. This is the naming used in version 0.10.0
and all future versions; older releases of DevAssistant use
&ldquo;modify&rdquo;
instead of &ldquo;tweak&rdquo; and &ldquo;task&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;extras&rdquo;. Each of the Assistant
types corresponds to the action you want to perform. Some Assistants
help you create new projects from scratch. Some tweak existing code by
adding new headers or generating new files from existing ones. The
extras (or &ldquo;task&rdquo;, in version 0.9.3) Assistants are used for all other
workflows that are not covered by the previously mentioned categories.
</p><p>
The prepare type is a bit special, as it is used for preparing the
environment for a specific project, not just a generic one. That means
that if you create a Web application in Django, add some dependencies,
have some specific database settings that work just for your app and
don't make sense for other Django projects, you can write a prepare
Assistant that will set up users' computers for them. Users then
can develop your application without making any further configuration
changes. This is especially helpful in cases where the project you
created is very complex and you want to make it easy for people to
submit patches to you. Consider that if a patch takes technically adept
users five minutes to write, and they have to spend an hour setting up their
environment just to verify that their patch works, they simply won't write it.
With DevAssistant, they spend maybe a minute installing a prepare
Assistant for your app and five minutes writing that patch. Everybody wins.
</p><p>
Out of the box, DevAssistant version 0.9.3 supports many popular languages
including Python, Java, C(++), PHP, Ruby, Node.js or Perl. For most of
these languages, sub-Assistants exist for particular frameworks or apps.
So under Python, you can find both the general Python library support
as well as Django. If necessary, more Assistants implementing Python
workflows easily can be added without affecting the existing ones. Both
the command-line arguments and the GUI screens then are generated
automatically. As a side note, DA comes with bash completion in Fedora,
which also is automatically generated right until the last parameter. All
the mentioned Assistants are available on the DAPI for installation into
DevAssistant 0.10.0 as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f5488"></a>
Docker</h2></div></div><p>
As you may have noticed, all I've mentioned up until now was
happening on the user's machine, on bare metal. At this very moment, we
are working on having the support for DevAssistant workflows in Docker
containers as well, which means that once you set up a development
environment in Docker with DA, you easily can share it with your
teammates or just publish the Dockerfile for anyone to rebuild. Note
that at the moment, DA is not the tool to deploy that very Docker image
in production, but we may add that functionality in the future.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f55e8"></a>
DevAssistant Package Index</h2></div></div><p>
As previously mentioned, one of the key parts of the DevAssistant
ecosystem is the DevAssistant Package Index, or DAPI. This is a server
for developers to upload their Assistants in packages, which are called
DAPs (DAP is short for DevAssistant Package). It's worth mentioning
that this mechanism is quite new (made for use with DevAssistant version
0.10.0), so more content and features are to come. In the aforementioned
version 0.10.0, users can install these packages directly with DA itself
by issuing the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
da pkg install FOO BAR
</pre>
</p><p>
Running this particular command would install the packages FOO and BAR
with all the DAPs on which these two depend. Similarly, users can un-install and
search directly from DevAssistant too. At the moment, this functionality
is available only in the command-line interface, but version 1.0 of
DevAssistant will feature a re-designed GUI with the same features in a
&ldquo;clickable&rdquo; form as well. 
</p><p>
If you are using version 0.9.3 of DevAssistant and want to install
a new Assistant, you need to do so yourself. First, you need to
download the DAP file, presumably from the DAPI Web interface found
at <a href="https://dapi.devassistant.org" target="_self">https://dapi.devassistant.org</a>. Once downloaded, you must unpack the file (it is technically
a gzipped tarball) into ~/.devassistant while stripping the topmost
directory. On the command line, this is done by running:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xzf DAP_NAME --strip-components=1
</pre>
</p><p>
In a graphical archive tool, you just select the second-level directories
(assistants, snippets, icons and so on) and extract those. Furthermore,
it is necessary to rename the directories &ldquo;twk&rdquo; or
&ldquo;extra&rdquo; to &ldquo;mod&rdquo; or
&ldquo;task&rdquo;, respectively, because of the older layout used by version
0.9.3. The reason for the apparent lack of user-friendliness is that due
to significant architectural changes between versions 0.9.3 and 0.10.0,
it takes a disproportionate amount of effort to backport the package
installation mechanism from 0.10.0 to the previous version, and we'd
rather spend it on fixing the new version and implementing new features
for you. For users of Fedora 21 who want to benefit from the DAPI
integration, we recommend using the COPR repository located at
<a href="https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/tradej/DevAssistant" target="_self">https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/tradej/DevAssistant</a>,
where version 0.10.0 is packaged.
</p><p>
Developers who want to upload a package to the DAPI need to log in
either with their GitHub account or Fedora's FAS account. Once
uploaded, the DAP is tested for validity, and if it passes, saved to the
repository. Obviously, this means there soon will be hundreds and
hundreds of DAPs in the index, and users will have to make sense of
them somehow. We have taken that into consideration, giving users
the ability to search by tags (filled in by the authors of DAPs) and
by quality, represented by a simple one-to-five-star system (as voted on by
logged-in users). There is, of course, a mechanism to report malicious
packages as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22f5b68"></a>
How Assistants Work</h2></div></div><p>
So far, I have been talking mainly about the user perspective only. If
you don't want to delve deeper in the technical side of things, feel
free to skip this section.
</p><p>
On the inside, DevAssistant consists of the core, which is written
in Python, and the Assistants accompanied by auxiliary files (which
are usually copied to the final project's directory structure). The
Assistants are written in a domain-specific language based on YAML. We
are expecting quite a few eyebrows will raise right now. We are perfectly aware
of the ramifications of this selection, and we didn't make it by rolling
dice or doing an eenie-meenie. Instead, we have done our research, and
although it wasn't the obvious or even the first choice, we settled with
YAML due to a number of reasons.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11792f3.large.jpg"><img src="11792f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A log window with a finished successful run&mdash;when you see
this, your project is ready.
</p></div></div><p>
First and foremost, it isn't associated with any other widely used
language. In the past, we repeatedly got a lot of negative feedback when
deciding to support only one particular language for writing modules
for programs. People using interpreted languages don't like compiled.
Users of static typing refuse to use dynamic, and so and so on. For this
reason, a markup language was the obvious choice. We didn't select simpler
formats like INI due to technical constraints, and we didn't select XML
because we think that the scripts should be written in something that
is readable by humans. YAML, a mature enough language used widely in
systems orchestration, which is fairly close to what DevAssistant does,
emerged as a victor of this challenge.
</p><p>
However, for those who do not want to write their whole script in YAML
and prefer to use their language of choice, there is a nice surprise in
version 0.10.0. You guessed it, DevAssistant has an API for running
scripts in other languages. For each language that you want to use for
running an Assistant, you need bindings for the DevAssistant PingPong
protocol (DAPP). At the moment, these bindings are available for Python
only in the form of a reference implementation. When using the bindings,
you need a minimal YAML Assistant file to specify dependencies, arguments
and the script, which then does all the heavy lifting itself.
</p><p>
The content of the YAML-only Assistant is fairly simple. There are
metadata like name and description, declarative dependencies, argument
and files sections, and an imperative run section that contains the actual
commands and shell calls that perform the Assistant's task. Assistants are
inheritable and support an inclusion mechanism; therefore, you easily
can do things like support Eclipse integration with all your Java projects
or add a specific Vim config to only a select few. The invocation of
DAPP-enabled scripts is done in the run section too, and it requires
only the script to be specified in the &ldquo;Files&rdquo; section.
</p><p>
As far as dependencies go, we tried to make the mechanism as bulletproof
as possible, which means that you can specify dependencies for a
particular packaging format (RPM, pip, pacman and so on) in a descending
order. So if DA cannot use a particular package manager, it moves on
until it finds one that is available or runs out of package managers
altogether. To answer a question we get quite often, right now we do not
support versioned dependencies due to the fact that it is difficult to
make sure that the underlying package managers report accurate information
to DA, but we're in the process of finding alternative solutions.
</p><p>
You can read further descriptions of the Assistants and related concepts at
<a href="http://docs.devassistant.org" target="_self">docs.devassistant.org</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22ec9d0"></a>
Going Further</h2></div></div><p>
At the moment, we have several initiatives going on, which largely
will define where DevAssistant goes from here. Apart from the aforementioned
Docker container support across Assistants, we aim to improve support of
certain project management workflows that take place after the project
has been created. However, this support is rather specific because we
do want to avoid duplicating the IDE functionality as much as possible.
</p><p>
On the integration level, DevAssistant is a part of a larger ongoing
effort to make Fedora Linux more accessible and attractive to
developers, so although DA does run on other Linux distros (and, mind you,
even runs on Mac OS), integration with Fedora is our main focus. That
means, among others things, automatically creating RPM SPEC files for your
projects, building on the Fedora infrastructure (especially COPR),
possibly deploying on FedoraHosted and the like.
</p><p>
In version 1.0, DA will have a new, more user-friendly graphical
interface, which also will support installing, removing and looking up
Assistants directly within the application. We still aren't quite sure
about some aspects of the GUI, so expect more to come.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x21fc580.0x22ecb88"></a>
Give It a Try</h2></div></div><p>
If you want to try DevAssistant, you can get it in several ways. For one,
it is present in the Fedora 21 Workstation installation by default (that
is true for version 0.9.3). This way, you get seamless installation,
bash completion and automatic updates as part of the system update
routine. Version 0.10.0 for this version of Fedora is accessible
as a COPR repository (for installation instructions, see the Download
section of the DevAssistant home page: <a href="https://devassistant.org/download" target="_self">https://devassistant.org/download</a>). Another option is downloading
DevAssistant from the Python Package Index. If your system is running
pip, you need to run:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pip install devassistant
</pre>
</p><p>
Bear in mind, though, that for some dependent Python libraries, you will
need certain underlying C header files, so the installation may not be
straightforward, and the program may not behave the way it is intended to.
It generally should be safer to use the Python 3 version of DA, installed
by invoking the Python 3 variant of pip. Still, we can't tell if it
will work as expected on your system. The last option is downloading the
source code from GitHub, which also is a perfectly valid way to go,
especially if you intend to contribute to DevAssistant.
</p><p>
We hope this article makes DevAssistant interesting to you, and that you
will check it out (if you pardon the pun). Both DA and DAPI are free and
open source (licensed under GPL v2+ and AGPL v3+, respectively). We're
eager to get more feedback, because DevAssistant is mainly about helping
you, and we can't do that if we don't know what you need as precisely as
possible&mdash;whether it's a message sent to the mailing list, an IRC question,
a bug report or a pull request, we are grateful for all that you tell us.
Let DevAssistant help you start developing with ease.
