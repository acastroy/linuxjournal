Our new house is built into the side of a hill. It's not quite a Hobbit
hole, and our doors are rectangular as opposed to round, but it still has
its challenges. The first challenge we face is mowing the front yard.
There's an approximate 15' drop over the 20' from the house to the road.
The safety concerns aside (mowing side to side is dangerous and really
difficult, and mowing downhill is asking to get your toes cut off), with
such a steep angle I couldn't keep the mower running! I went through
several &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; before I found one that works. I bought a big weed
whacker, thinking I'd mow the lawn that way. Then I bought a plug-in model
electric mower, which somehow tries to eat its own cord at every turn. The
final solution was a battery-operated mower. It works great, and the
batteries are shockingly long-lasting. Ten years ago, the thought of a
battery-powered lawn mower would have been ridiculous. As technology
advances, the impossible becomes the practical. So, I say this fairly
often:
&ldquo;It's so awesome to live in the future!&rdquo;

Dave Taylor starts off the issue this month by traveling to Mars. Well, that's not entirely
accurate. He starts off on the process of coding a text-based game
simulating the landing procedure for a spacecraft on the surface of Mars.
If you've ever played <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lunar Lander</em></span> and wanted to test the math, Dave's
column will be right up your alley.

Most of us have a pile of servers somewhere in the house or garage that we
use for experiments and to store our files. Kyle Rankin's server is in his
garage (I'm jealous, I don't have a garage), and he recently decided it was
time to upgrade. Rather than buying a huge server, however, Kyle decided to
create a powerful NAS device using the smallest and most power-efficient
server possible. This month he walks through his process and explains
how he landed on the final solution. It's tinier and far more efficient
than anything available just a few years ago. If you want to revamp your
server closet or save some electricity by replacing old power hogs, check
out his column.

I decided I wanted to do old things in new ways, but the things I wanted to
do were all game-related. I spent a shameful number of weekends in my youth
playing Nintendo games. Although Nintendo is releasing a console this winter
with some classic NES games embedded into the system, there's something
special about playing with the original controllers. This month I turned a
Raspberry Pi and a cigar box into an emulation machine for Nintendo and
Super Nintendo. If you ever played <span   class="emphasis"><em>Super Mario Brothers
3</em></span> or had fever
dreams about building experience points by killing Slime Molds, come play
along.

We have a guest columnist this issue talking about SNMP. Andrew Kirch
explains SNMP in simple terms and shares his frustrations over the lack of
development it's gotten during the past decade. SNMP is more than just a way
to read network data and build throughput charts. It's a two-way protocol
that allows for actual management of devices. For a look at how SNMP works
and why we should be giving it more attention, be sure to read Andrew's
column!

Nathan R. Vance and William F. Polik teach how to build a wall.
Specifically, they describe how to use firewalld in multi-zone configurations.
Firewalld makes building firewall rules much easier, and that clarity
allows for more complex sets of rules that still make sense. Nathan and
William take the daunting concept of firewall zones and make it easy to
understand. They're followed by another Andrew, Andrew Nii Addo, who gives
us a lesson on rescuing hard drives with a Raspberry Pi. For years I kept a
full-blown tower on my workbench for the inevitable hard drive rescue
operations. With Andrew's guidance, you can use a simple Raspberry Pi to do
the same task in a far more convenient way.

The Linux kernel itself was created to do something old in a new way. In
fact, pretty much everything we do with technology is designed to do old
tasks in more efficient ways. Sometimes it's important to stick with tried
and true methods. So we've also included the usual tech tips, product
announcements and technology tidbits you've come to expect from every
issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>. I learned a lot this month, and as a reward, I plan
to play Nintendo. Maybe not as long as I did in high school, but I think
there are still a few Slime Molds left in the forest who need to taste my
sword!
