<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> previously has published articles that
provide insight
on the applications of udev,
ddrescue and Raspberry Pi home automation
employing the use of relays. This article combines the unique features of
each of those tools to solve the issue of 
failing hard disks.
</p><p>
My Uncle Tee has a knack for relegating most of his computer-related
problems
to me. During our last visit, I was confronted with a task of transferring the files
on an old 750GB USB hard disk to a newer one. My knee-jerk reaction was
to plug the device in to my Linux box, mount it and use
<tt  >cp</tt> or <tt  >rsync</tt> to
replicate all the files to the new disk.
</p><p>
And, that's exactly what I did. With the old and new disk drives plugged
in to USB ports and mounted at /media/usb0 and /media/usb1, respectively, I
proceeded to invoke the <tt  >rsync</tt> command. (Use your
distro's package manager 
to install rsync if it is not already present.) I
must mention, however, that it took a considerable amount of time
for the old drive device to register itself, and the mounting time 
also was noticeably protracted. All of this indicated a failing hard
disk drive:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rsync -av --progress --inplace \
/media/usb0/* /media/usb1/
</pre>
</p><p>
Everything seemed okay, and I continued nursing my warm cup of favorite
black tea&mdash;at least, until it started to look otherwise. I could not fail
to notice the input/output error messages that started to appear in
rsync's verbose output. Then, rsync itself exited abruptly with error
code 23. This translates to &ldquo;partial transfer&rdquo; from the errcode.h
header file in rsync's sources. Immediately re-running the same
command confirmed the source no longer existed.
</p><p>
The old hard disk device that was mounted at /dev/usb0 was not present in
the output of <tt  >lsusb</tt> and
<tt  >blkid</tt>. It was suspended after the first 13GB was
transferred, and I had to power-cycle the hard disk for it to show up again in
the list of detected devices. rsync exited prematurely again in another
attempt, this time after a few megabytes. 
</p><p>
In fact, a few more attempts
followed, each one adding a decreasing amount to the transferred files. I
obviously was making little progress with this laborious process, which
also required a lot of attention. That was when it occurred to me as to
why my Uncle Tee wanted to relegate this task to me. Apparently,
the hard disk had not registered on his Windows machine for some time
now, and with no available backup, he was in need of a miracle.
</p><p>
I needed a solution that would just continue where it left off after
a previous unsuccessful attempt. A solution that skipped the mounting step
also could improve the overall process in rescuing the contents of the
disk. Replicating the files always could be done at a later stage when an
image was available. ddrescue came in handy here. It maintains a log file
that is used to resume the rescue process. A good review of
ddrescue
is available at <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/magazine/hack-and-when-disaster-strikes-hard-drive-crashes" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/magazine/hack-and-when-disaster-strikes-hard-drive-crashes</a>.
(Again, use your Linux distro's package manager 
to install ddrescue.) I basically ran the following command
with root privileges:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ddrescue -dv /dev/sdb1 ./freeagent.img \
./freeagent.log
</pre>
</p><p>
The /dev/sdb1 device corresponds to the source partition I wanted to
recover. I ensured that there was enough space on the destination partition for
the freeagent.img image file to be generated. The last argument is a log
file maintained by ddrescue to make resumption possible. Although this
is optional, it will be very much needed in this case, as the
ddrescue
process will be resumed a number of times.
</p><p>
It is also possible to run ddrescue with a retry
option, in which case it
retries bad blocks a specified number of times before proceeding. However,
it's
not advisable to use this option in this situation, as it could
wind the failing hard disk down to a halt at a faster rate. With
the log file in place, it is always possible to rerun
ddrescue after a
first complete scan to retry the bad blocks. The generated image file will
be updated accordingly.
</p><p>
Armed with the above knowledge, I planned the recovery process:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Run the <tt  >ddrescue</tt> command as above.
</p></li><li><p>
Power-cycle the hard disk when it suspends.
</p></li><li><p>
Wait until the device is detected by the machine and get the new device name.
</p></li><li><p>
Go to step 1, updating the source device with the name from step 3.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
After looping through the above sequence a few times and also considering
the sometimes tiny progress being made on each iteration, one thing
was clear: I was going to spend a great part of the rest of my life
staring at a console screen waiting for the return of an error message,
manually power-cycling the hard disk, restarting the rescue process and
start staring again. I needed to upgrade my solution to free me from this
torture. This solution should require as little human intervention as possible
from the beginning until the full image is generated. This was when I
started to explore the possibility of employing a Raspberry
Pi for the task. (The reasoning that led to this choice will become
clear as the solution takes shape.)
</p><p>
I happened to own a Raspberry Pi 2 model B. I dumped the latest version
of the Raspbian image onto a MicroSD card, and this is how the solution
started. (Note: you can find a good how-to on how to get this running at <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian" target="_self">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian</a>.)
You can use any of the available Raspberry Pi models, although you might need to adapt 
the steps that follow slightly (I'll try to point it out if your
mileage will differ as a result of using a different model).
</p><p>
Step 1 is the one-liner as already shown above. But, what happens after a
power cycle? A udev rule could be added to resume the
ddrescue recovery
when the device is detected after being powered on.
udev is currently the
default device manager for the Linux kernel, and it comes pre-installed
in almost all modern distributions, including the Raspbian image of the
Raspberry Pi. 
</p><p>
To create a rule, you need to know the device information of
the hard disk. Once you have the device name and the partition
to be recovered, you can call up the rest of the information with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ udevadm info --query=property --name /dev/sdb1
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can monitor the flow of information during device detection by
running the following command before plugging in the USB hard disk and
powering it up:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ udevadm monitor --environment
</pre>
</p><p>
A stripped-down version of the section I am looking for looks like
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
UDEV [6899.460576] add /devices/platform/soc/...
ACTION=add
DEVNAME=/dev/sdb1
DEVTYPE=partition
ID_SERIAL=ST3750640AS_5QD463QL
ID_SERIAL_SHORT=5QD463QL
ID_TYPE=disk
SUBSYSTEM=block
TAGS=:systemd:
</pre>
</p><p>
You will use this information to prepare the udev rule that will be
saved in the /etc/udev/rules.d directory. It is a good idea not to add
your rule directly to any of the existing default files. Create a new
file following the naming conventions for your new rule. I named my
file 90-freeagent.rules, and it contains a rule to match the USB hard disk
using the information from above:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ACTION=="add", KERNEL=="sd?1", \
ENV{SUBSYSTEM}=="block", \
ENV{ID_SERIAL}=="ST3750640AS_5QD463QL", \
ENV{DEVTYPE}=="partition", \
RUN+="/opt/bin/freeagent.sh '%E{DEVNAME}'"
</pre>
</p><p>
With the exception of the last section, notice that the rule basically is made
up of a string matching the attributes obtained above. The last section
specifies the path to a script to be run when a match is made. Notice
also that the syntax allows me to pass the name of the device detected as
an argument to the script. Now you safely can check steps 3 and 4 as done.
</p><p>
There is one more fact about udev worth mentioning: <tt  >RUN</tt> can
be used only for very short-running foreground tasks. Scripts with a
protracted duration will be terminated prematurely and unconditionally
after the event handling has finished. udev enforces this to prevent
blocking all further events for the device or a dependent one. There
are a number of ways to circumvent this; some obviously are more elegant
than others. I relocated the main job to another script and delegated
this to the atd d&aelig;mon. Install the &ldquo;at&rdquo; package if you are
following along.
</p><p>
Now you can roll out the contents of the script that is referenced by
the <tt  >RUN</tt> section of the udev rule:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
export HDDEVNAME=$1
at -f "/opt/bin/ddfreeagent.sh" now
</pre>
</p><p>
The worker script, named ddfreeagent.sh, for now, will contain
the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

IMG=/media/usb0/freeagent/freeagent.img
LOG=/media/usb0/freeagent/freeagent.log

/usr/bin/ddrescue -dv ${HDDEVNAME} ${IMG} ${LOG}
</pre>
</p><p>
Ensure that both scripts have the execute permissions set.
</p><p>
Step 2 currently is the only one outstanding. You need a way to power-cycle
the hard disk when it suspends. This sounds like a task for a relay.
The Raspberry Pi makes interfacing a relay to a PC even easier, which
adds more weight to this choice of target device or platform on which to
implement the solution. It already comes equipped with a set of easy-to-use
GPIO pins that could be used to perform the power-cycle procedure through a
relay.
</p><p>
The eventual solution employs a solid-state relay whose control signals
come from the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi unit. The relay controls the
power to the hard disk. The rescue process starts by triggering the
relay to turn on the hard disk. The Raspberry Pi senses the device, and
the udev rule implemented above spawns a script that starts the
ddrescue
process. This comes to an abrupt end when the hard disk suspends and
returns with an error code, which is caught and processed accordingly. The
relay then fires a reset sequence to the hard disk power supply in case
of an error return from ddrescue, and the whole process starts again. The
log file maintained by ddrescue means the rescue operation resumes from
where it left off on the previous attempt. A success return from
ddrescue
ends the rescue process.
</p><p>
As you may have gathered from the above summary, this step involves playing
with naked wires that will carry dangerous voltage levels. It is very
important to observe safety precautions. Make sure you do all the work when the devices
are off and can worked on safely. I recommend that you proceed 
with the implementation only when you are sure of what you are doing.
</p><p>
I managed to find a solid-state relay at a local store to use
to control a load running on AC power. This is essential,
as relays that control DC-powered loads also are available, and they are
by no means interchangeable. Working with these little boxes is very
convenient, as they also respond to voltages as little as 3.3V. As this
also happens to be the voltage level of the Raspberry Pi output pins,
this means they can be connected directly. Other relay types (mostly
coil-based conventional relays) require a separate circuit to
bridge them to the Raspberry Pi unit. This is necessary to raise the 3.3V
to levels that can trigger the relay. These circuits isolate the load
and provide added protection to the unit. Solid-state relays typically
come with built-in isolation circuits.
</p><p>
Having all the needed tools at hand, I proceeded to work on step 2. I
identified one of the general-purpose pins on the board for use as an
output pin. This pin, together with the ground pin, will be connected to
the input side of the relay. The relay is clearly labeled: the ground pin
goes to the negative terminal, and the chosen output pin goes to the positive.
</p><p>
Next, I found an old extension cord, striped off the insulation at a
section along its length and severed the live cable. Both ends were then
fed into the output or load terminals of the relay. This extension cord
will be used to power only the failing hard disk. Figure 1 shows a picture of the
setup.

Two steps are needed to prepare the selected GPIO pin for output on the
console. First, export the pin for the operating system to prepare the
direction files. There are two different ways to refer to pins,
and this can be a source of great confusion. Physical numbering is the
natural way to refer to the pins, and it counts across and down from pin 1
at the top left (nearest to the SD card). GPIO numbering, on the other
hand, refers to how the computer sees the pins and does not follow any
particular order. You need to check the particular model of Raspberry
Pi you are using and identify the correct way to refer to the pins. I
use the GPIO numbers in the script here.
</p><p>
I used pin 40 (GPIO 21) on the Raspberry Pi 2 model B as my output pin. Run the
following to export the pin:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "21" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, specify the direction of use&mdash;an output pin in this case:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "out" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio21/direction
</pre>
</p><p>
With this done, and the above setup in place, the following command switches on
the hard disk:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "1" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio21/value
</pre>
</p><p>
Switch it off with this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "0" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio21/value
</pre>
</p><p>
At the end of everything, you need to clean up by un-exporting the pin:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo "21" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/unexport
</pre>
</p><p>
Putting it all together, now you can update the contents of the
ddfreeagent.sh worker script (Listing 1).

  echo -n "," &gt;&gt; ${RUNLOG}
  echo -n $(cat /proc/uptime | cut -d' ' -f1) &gt;&gt; ${RUNLOG}
  echo -n "," &gt;&gt; ${RUNLOG}

}

if ! [ -f ${RUNLOG} ]; then
  do_log START
fi

/usr/bin/ddrescue -dv ${HDDEVNAME} ${IMGFILE} ${LOGFILE}
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
  #Yay! ddrescue completed successfully.
  do_log PASS

  # Clean up now and exit
  echo "0" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio${PIN}/value
  echo ${PIN} &gt; /sys/class/gpio/unexport

  exit
else
  #Oops; another ddrescue error.
  do_log FAIL

  #Power-cycle the hard disk.
  echo "0" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio${PIN}/value
  sleep 10
  echo "1" &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio${PIN}/value
fi
</pre></div><p>
I also have included some logs to give me an idea of how long the whole
process took and how many times I otherwise would have had to 
power-cycle the hard drive manually. Kickstart the chain process by triggering
the relay to turn on the hard disk.
</p><p>
After about 27 hours and some 130 hard disk power cycles,
ddrescue finally
exited with success. (Your mileage will, of course, vary depending on the size
and state of the hard disk and also on the Raspberry Pi model you're using.)
This meant a mountable image of the failing hard disk was ready. I then
mounted the image with a simple mount command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mount /media/usb0/freeagent/freeagent.img /media/usb3/
</pre>
</p><p>
And finally, I copied them to a backup directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ rsync -av --progress --inplace /media/usb3/* /media/usb0/backup
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember to disable the process when you're done to avoid unwanted runs of
the cycle. You can remove the execute permissions from the udev target
scripts and/or comment out the line containing the udev rule.
</p><p>
And, this concludes the story of how I managed to get Uncle Tee the miracle he so
badly needed. All the files he couldn't do without were 
recovered successfully. I kept smiling as I sat there watching the hard disk
being power-cycled, having to do nothing myself. There were no interruptions this
time, as I sipped my favorite black tea.
