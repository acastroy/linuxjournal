Figuring out all the formulas needed for a simple physics game on
Mars.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e5580.0x14dd3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Remember that I said &ldquo;let's write another game&rdquo; in my last
column? Well,
this is the beginning of a series of articles where I develop a variation
on the classic lunar-lander game themed around the planet Mars. 
To do this in three dimensions can be rather complicated, so in the spirit
of the original arcade game (that I became rather obsessed with, I should
admit), I'm going to tackle the simplified two-dimensional problem. I
also am going to discount terrain issues, although clearly landing on the
very edge of one of the mysterious Martian canals would be more tricky than
a flat plain in the Schiaparelli crater.
</p><p>
Oh also, I'm not going to have any graphics at all. This is going
to be a game where you enter thrust commands second by second and either
shoot off into orbit and land smoothly on the Martian surface or crash into
the planet. You want to add graphics? Excellent. But I'm going to leave
that as an exercise for you, the reader, as that's pretty far afield for
this shell scripting column.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e5580.0x14dd618"></a>
Gravitational Mathematics</h2></div></div><p>
I can't begin Martian lander without talking about physics, because
it's Newton's laws (they're not just a good idea!) that
describe the process of an object coming into the gravitational field of
another and being pulled toward its center.
</p><p>
The Newtonian gravitational formula is 
<span   class="emphasis"><em>F = G m1 m2 / r2</em></span>,
and the big idea is that every object in the universe attracts every other
object with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and
inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two
objects. 
</p><p>
I'm not going to worry about other planets, however, because the
gravitational force that far distant objects have on a ship attempting to
land on Mars is quite negligible (to say the least). The difference in mass
between a planet and a spaceship are enormous too, allowing me to simplify
the formula: <span   class="emphasis"><em>velocity = gravity * time</em></span>.
</p><p>
If I drop something out of a stationary helicopter (or off the side of a
building), in second 0, it'll be falling at 0 ft/s. After one second,
it'll be traveling 32 ft/s, and after ten seconds, it'll be going
320 ft/sec. I'm discounting air resistance, and so on, but this example is
regarding landing
a spaceship on Mars, so there really isn't much atmosphere to worry
about here.
</p><p>
The next question is how far has the object fallen in a specified number of
seconds? This is a more complex equation:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>distance = ( gravity * time**2 ) / 2</em></span>.
</p><p>
So after those same ten seconds, the object will have fallen <span   class="emphasis"><em>(32 *
(10**2))/2 = 1600 feet</em></span>. If I begin the Earthly descent one mile above the
surface, that means that without any rockets to slow things down, it'll
take just more than 18 seconds to crash.
</p><p>
Mars, however, has a different gravitational force than Earth does. Earth
is 32.1 ft/s, while Mars, with only 15% of the mass of our home planet, has
a gravity of 12.1 ft/s.
</p><p>
This means that from a one mile orbital trajectory, it would take a lot
longer&mdash;almost 30 seconds to crash into the surface of the planet.
That's a lot
more time to wonder why you forgot to add thrusters to your Martian lander,
for sure!
</p><p>
There's a third equation also needed for this game: horizontal velocity. The
idea is that the lander will begin in orbit, so it'll have a starting
horizontal velocity but no vertical velocity. The rocket boosters will be
able to be turned to a specific angle and fired, so with just the right
effort, you can stop the horizontal motion entirely, allowing the craft to
descend straight onto the planet&mdash;a good thing, because hitting the surface
with lots of horizontal motion is going to be a crash!
</p><p>
In this case, the formula is really easy, because there's no force
&ldquo;pulling&rdquo; the craft ever faster around the planet nor any force
(such as wind resistance) that's slowing it down either. So if the craft
starts with a 100 ft/sec horizontal velocity, it'll land with exactly the same
velocity if the thrusters don't slow it down.
</p><p>
For simplicity, the formula I'll use is <span   class="emphasis"><em>speedH = initial speed
&ndash; thrust</em></span>.
So to stop all horizontal speed, a burst that exactly matches the current
speed is all that's required. I'll assume this all happens
essentially instantaneously.
</p><p>
But, the thrusters can operate within a 90&deg; rotation, ranging from
straight downward (all vertical thrust, no effect on horizontal speed) to
straight forward (all horizontal thrust, no effect on vertical drop). How
do you model that? Here are my shots at the formulas, with zero degrees being
down and 90 degrees being forward:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>thrustH = thrust * (angle / 90)</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>thrustV = thrust * (1 &ndash; (angle / 90))</em></span>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
So a thrust of 100fps at 45&deg; should balance out, and <span   class="emphasis"><em>100*(45/90) =
50fps</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>100 * (1 &ndash; (45/90)) = 50</em></span>. Good.
What about a 10&deg; thrust?
ThrustH = 11.11 fps and ThrustV = 88.88 fps.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13e5580.0x14de0c0"></a>
Building the Program from the Math</h2></div></div><p>
Now I have the basic mathematics required, remembering that each second of
time adds (gravity) vertical acceleration toward the Martian surface.
To
make this more fun, I'm going to assume that the one-mile mark is the very
edge of the Martian gravity, so if at any point the craft goes farther than
a mile from the surface, it's lost in deep space.
</p><p>
You simply could burn the retro rockets at exactly the force of gravity for
as long as it takes to land on the surface, but of course, you don't have
that much fuel (predictably!). There are constraints to the rocket boosters
too: no burst greater than 100fps is allowed, or it'll tear the lander
apart, which is definitely not a desired outcome!
</p><p>
That means you can't wait until the last second and slam a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>huge</em></span> burst
of rocket power just before you crash&mdash;not to mention that the g-forces would be
more than a bit problematical!
</p><p>
Let's start pulling things together. At any given second, you'll have
the options of firing the thruster, how much to fire it and at what angle
it should be fired. Against that, at any given second, you'll have both
horizontal and vertical velocity and vertical gravitational pull.
Like this:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>thrustH = thrust * (angle / 90)</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>thrustV = thrust * (1 &ndash; (angle / 90))</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>velocityH = velocityH &ndash; thrustH</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>velocityV = (velocityV + gravity) &ndash; thrustV</em></span>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The initial values are thrust = 0, angle = 0, velocityH = 100 (everything
will be in feet per second for simplicity) and velocityV = 0. Gravity on
Mars = 12.1.
</p><p>
There's another formula required, and that's height. At any given
second then,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>height = height &ndash; (velocityV)</em></span>.
</p><p>
If the craft starts at 5280 feet off the Martian surface, then in second
zero:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
thrustH = 0
</p></li><li><p>
thrustV = 0
</p></li><li><p>
velocityH = 100
</p></li><li><p>
velocityV = 0
</p></li><li><p>
height = 5280
</p></li></ul></div><p>
And, in second one, assuming you fire the thrusters at 20fps for one second
at 45 degrees:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>thrustH = 20 * ( 45/90 ) = 10</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>thrustV = 20 * ( (1 &ndash; (45/90) ) = 10</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>velocityH = (100 &ndash; 10) = 90</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>velocityV = (0 + 12.1 &ndash; 10) = 2.1</em></span>
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>height = (5280 &ndash; 2.1) = 5278.9</em></span>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
See how that works? It's not too bad once you get through all the basic
calculations. 
</p><p>
Having gone through all of this physics and mathematics, in my next column, 
I'll jump into the coding, because it's going to be pretty
straightforward. So stay tuned!
</p><p>
Note: thanks to my friend Brad Waller for pointing out all the major
oversimplifications in my physics modeling. My defense is that it's
just a game, and I'm sticking with that, so take a deep breath, physics
nerds.
