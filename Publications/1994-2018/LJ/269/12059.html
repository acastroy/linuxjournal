Tux in Public!</h4><p>
On a recent trip to western New York State, I sat down to use the public
computer in the hotel lobby and was shocked to find it running Ubuntu with
Unity. It was hooked up to a multi-function printer device like you
normally find in hotel business centers, and while not a fan of Unity, I
was able to get online easily and it worked fine. This is the first time
I've seen Tux in a place so visible to the general public. How great is
that?

About Let's Encrypt</h4><p>
I've been a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> reader for more than five years, although the English is
sometimes strange for me.
</p><p>
After reading Andrei Lukovenko's article &ldquo;Let's Automate Let's
Encrypt&rdquo; in the June 2016 issue, I
decided to write you to congratulate you for all of your great work and, even
more, to thank Andrei. I was searching for a way to use SSL on my recently
actualized Request Tracker server, and this article came as a ring on my
finger! In less than five minutes, my server used a certified certificate, and
there were no more warnings from the browser about untrusted sites.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> is a great journal, with great articles!

Proxmox Kernel Is Not Debian-Based</h4><p>
John S. Tonello's article &ldquo;The Tiny Internet, Part II&rdquo; in the July 2016 issue introduces Proxmox VE. However, its kernel is either RHEL or
Ubuntu based on a Debian environment, not directly based on Debian. This is
how we choose server-grade hardware for running Proxmox VE, according to
the certified or compatibility lists from Red Hat or Canonical. FYI.

<br><br>&mdash;<br>

</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>John S. Tonello replies:</b></span> Thanks for the clarification about Proxmox VE.
To clarify, is it fair to say the kernel is pure Red Hat or Ubuntu, but the
environment is something like Debian 6/7? I wanted to let readers know that
the CLI interface is closer to a Debian experience than, say, Ubuntu, and
avoid delving too deep into the kernel itself, which is a more advanced
topic.
</p><p>
Thanks for writing. Proxmox VE is a great tool and one more people should
know about!
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>

Here's the wiki about Proxmox VE kernel: <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_VE_Kernel" target="_self">https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Proxmox_VE_Kernel</a>. I think it's better
to say &ldquo;Red
Hat or Ubuntu based&rdquo;, because it's actually not &ldquo;pure&rdquo;. The team has done
some customization themselves, for example, adding container support
like OpenVZ.
</p><p>
The CLI part is indeed Debian (5/6/7/8 for Proxmox VE version 1/2/3/4), along
with their own repo in APT system: <a href="https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Package_repositories" target="_self">https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Package_repositories</a>.
</p><p>
It's really a convenient tool for building up a PaaS virtualization host with
Proxmox VE in minutes. It's good to see that <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> has so many pages to
introduce it!

<span   class="emphasis"><em>4232</em></span>, a Short Animation Film Using Software Libre</h4><p>
My name is Ernesto Bazzano (Bazza), and I'm an Argentinian artist.
I'm making a short animated film called <span   class="emphasis"><em>4232</em></span>, using libre
software with GNU/Linux&mdash;software made and supported by communities
of programmers and developers worried about freedom.
</p><p>
Among other software, I use the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
GIMP: to clean the scanned images, and for coloring and image processing.
</p></li><li><p>
Synfig Studio: to mount the animation frame by frame.
</p></li><li><p>
My own programs: the drawings of <span   class="emphasis"><em>4232</em></span> are hand-made. I develop
programs that allow Synfig to incorporate real drawings. 
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In
addition to making my short animated film, I generate programs that can
help others artists in their work.
</p><p>
Animation is a very complex activity, thought to be created by a lot of
people, in big studios and with big budgets. I'm making applications to
speed up and make the whole animation process easier. This way, it's a
little bit easier for artists with the desire but with a small budget to make
their dream animations.
</p><p>
Here's a synopsis of <span   class="emphasis"><em>4232</em></span>.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>4232</em></span> is a story about a post-apocalyptic future. In a metropolis
surrounded by a big dome, the aristocracy has converted poor people into
robots, undressing them of all humanity. They are the robot-workers used for exploitation of the last resources
on the Earth, which is turning into a big barren desert.
Some people have escaped this metropolis and found shelter in small
constructions outside the dome, surrounded by desert and pollution.
</p><p>
One day, the inhabitants of one of these shelters finds a robot in the
desert&mdash;number <span   class="emphasis"><em>4232</em></span>. Unlike the other robots,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>4232</em></span> preserves his
consciousness and relates to them how he escaped the metropolis. So
the people of the desert start to wonder why <span   class="emphasis"><em>4232</em></span> is different and see him
as hope for their own robot-ized friends and families to recover their
consciousness.
</p><p>

Ernesto,
wow! It's great to see open-source software used so extensively. In my quick
perusal of your site, I wasn't able to find a sample of the end product, but
your process looks fascinating. Please consider pitching an article idea our
way, I'm sure our readers would love to learn more about your methods.
