One of my favorite things about Linux is that it has become not only the platform of
choice for many projects, but it also tends to inspire an entire ecosystem of
open-source solutions. It's almost as if, when the operating system is free, it only
makes sense that the things built on top of it are free too. In this September
issue, you'll see the
all-encompassing Linux environment in action.
</p><p>
First up is Reuven M. Lerner, who is discussing scaling applications to handle
simultaneous connections. Anyone who has waited in line to get into an amusement
park knows that the only way massive throughput works is if there are multiple
&ldquo;lanes&rdquo; working together at the same time. That concept is demonstrated perfectly
in web applications, and Reuven explains how. 
</p><p>
Dave Taylor follows with a bit of
advancement on scripting dice rolls. He described a simple dice game last month, but
what about dice that have more than six sides? Dave's article will expand your dice knowledge while
making you better scripters at the same time.
</p><p>
Backups are a passion of mine, and thankfully it's a topic Kyle Rankin and I agree
is vitally important. This month, Kyle demonstrates a low-power way to create a fast
and effective backup system using a Banana Pi. A similar thing could be done with
Raspberry Pi, but the Banana is a bit faster, which is ideal for backups. I help
make things faster this month too, but rather than dealing with backups, I continue my series
on Ansible. I love using Ansible, because it thinks like a system administrator,
which happens to be the way I think too!
</p><p>
I mentioned earlier that Linux is great for &ldquo;Soup to Nuts&rdquo;-type projects. Kyle
demonstrated that with his backup system, but John S. Tonello goes even further by
explaining the &ldquo;Full Stack&rdquo; concept. Being able to develop an application is a
desirable trait for many employers, but if you can handle every aspect of
development and deployment, it makes you (and your app) far more
valuable. John
explains how the Full Stack idea works by walking through the development of an
app you can see in action today!
</p><p>
Lee Phillips addresses a topic that is near and dear to my heart&mdash;specifically,
writing. Most people know documentation is that thing we all value, and yet so few
of us do it well. Using Pandoc and Panflute, Lee walks through creating a
publishing pipeline that takes most of the frustration out of technical writing,
allowing you to focus on the actual writing itself. Anything that makes technical
writing easier is a benefit to our entire community, so be sure to check out his
article.
</p><p>
Linux is the perfect platform for experimentation, application and education.
Whether you want to build a web application from the ground up or literally
want to create an interactive application for sharing soup and nut recipes, Linux
really shines. As always, we've included product announcements, reviews, tech tips
and countless other useful bits of Linux-related information. We hope you enjoy
the issue as much as we've enjoyed putting it together!
