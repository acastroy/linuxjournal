Those of us of a certain age, and with the need to write technical
papers, mathematical or otherwise, are likely to be intimate with TeX
and LaTeX. We studied Donald Knuth's <span   class="emphasis"><em>TexBook</em></span>, climbed the ferocious
learning curve and were pleased with the result. Our papers may or may
not have been any good, but they certainly looked good.
</p><p>
Then, the web took over the world, seemingly overnight. Some of us
wanted our work to live in this new, online environment, so we learned a
wholly new system of markup. Then we learned a third language, CSS (Cascading
Style Sheets), and maybe even a little JavaScript.
</p><p>
We still wrote our real work in LaTeX, while turning to HTML for our
hobbies. If we wanted to put one of our papers on the web, we resorted
to one of several options for translation from LaTeX to HTML. None of
these were excellent, but they could produce some approximation of how
the paper was supposed to appear. Of course, we always could translate
our papers by hand, but most people were, naturally, galled by the
duplication of effort this entailed.
</p><p>
Since TeX is a Turing-complete language, it is generally impossible to
translate it into a declarative markup system like HTML. Several
projects address this problem by defining a subset of LaTeX allowed for
input. A better approach is that followed by Docbook, Tbook, Pandoc
(<a href="http://pandoc.org/index.html" target="_self">pandoc.org/index.html</a>) and some others: define a more general
markup language, or system of XML tags, and translate that into any of
the desired targets. Pandoc, one of the subjects of this article, offers
more than that, promising to translate between many possible pairs of
formats. However, its parsing of some of these, including, critically,
LaTeX, is faulty or incomplete. This needn't concern us, because the
best way to unlock Pandoc's power is by using its &ldquo;native&rdquo; input format,
which is an extended dialect of Markdown. Pandoc can translate this into
a really impressive set of output formats, including not just LaTeX and
HTML, but even ODT and docx, so we can communicate with colleagues
unfortunate enough to be stuck using Word. Pandoc is a mature, free
software project; a recent version probably is available through your
system's package manager. And if you use LaTeX, you probably know that
the best way to outfit yourself is by installing the Tex Live
distribution, either through your package manager or directly from the
Tex Users' Group source (<a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive" target="_self">https://www.tug.org/texlive</a>). 
</p><p>
If you are familiar with Markdown, you may be skeptical of the abilities
of a system based upon it, as the original Markdown is too anemic for
any type of complex or technical writing. However, Pandoc's extended
version of Markdown, while retaining its simplicity for simple things,
allows you to include LaTeX math, bibliographic references, internal and
external hyperlinks, tables, language-specific syntax highlighting,
bulleted and automatically numbered lists, images with captions and
much more:



<pre     class="programlisting">
Here is a simple example of Pandoc's Markdown.

That was the first paragraph. This is the second.
It was originally based on email conventions.
You can have *italics*, **boldface**, and 
~strikethrough~~ text. 

Creating hyperlinks is as easy as
[example.com](http://example.com);
you can also use your
[BibTeX keys][@winterberg2004] this way.

Insert LaTeX equations directly, like $e^{i&pi;} = -1$
</pre>
</p><p>
In addition to all this, Pandoc has the ability to be extended and
customized through filters and templates&mdash;and that brings me to the
real subject of this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c7580.0x27bf7d0"></a>
Filters</h2></div></div><p>
Pandoc works by translating its input into an internal representation,
performing certain transformations on the representation and then
translating the result into the desired output format. Because of this
architecture, where parsing, transformation and output are decoupled,
developers can add, for instance, the ability to translate a new format
by just writing a module for parsing that format into the internal
structure. And, they can support a new output language just by writing a
translation from the internal representation into that language.
</p><p>
Crucial to the advanced use of Pandoc is the idea
of a filter. A filter
is a program, invoked with a flag on the command line, that steps in
after Pandoc has parsed its input and makes changes to the document's
internal representation. The filter can be indifferent to the eventual
output format, or it can do different things depending on the target.
For example, when creating HTML, you may want to alter the behavior of
footnotes so that the conventional superscript with note at the bottom
is changed to revealing the footnote text when the reader hovers over
the footnoted word.
</p><p>
Some of the useful things that Pandoc does out of the box are
implemented as filters. Academic users depend on adding the flag
<tt  >--filter pandoc-citeproc</tt>, along with the
<tt  >--bibliography</tt> flag to
indicate the location of a BibTex database file. (The system can handle
EndNote, MEDLINE and several other database formats as well.) This
filter takes keys from the BibTex file, turns them into citations in
your chosen style and adds a bibliography to the end. It replicates the
abilities of LaTeX/BibTex to handle reference data stored in a BibTex
database, but it can handle HTML and other output formats besides TeX.
</p><p>
Pandoc is written in Haskell, which makes that the native and most
natural language in which to write Pandoc filters. But, knowledge of this
language is not very widespread. Since Haskell and I are at most distant
acquaintances, I turned to panflute
(<a href="http://scorreia.com/software/panflute" target="_self">scorreia.com/software/panflute</a>), a package for writing Pandoc
filters in Python. There are others, but panflute is somewhat easier to
use, making the potentially arcane knowledge of Pandoc filters
accessible to the average developer. You can install panflute with pip,
the Python package manager.
</p><p>
The hardest part of getting up to speed with panflute is learning about
its data structures, which shadow the data types internal to Pandoc. But
once you become familiar with it, you can do powerful things with very
few lines of code. Before I get to the case study that became the
impetus for writing this article, let's have a look at a few simple
examples to get the general flavor of Pandoc filters in Python.
</p><p>
Suppose you've sprinkled your article with italics and boldface, but the
journal's editor has just informed you that their house style does not
allow bold text. You could resort to a regular expression substitution,
but this is notoriously error-prone, especially when applied to textual
markup. Here's a Pandoc filter, using panflute, that changes all
instances of bold text to italic, while leaving italic text as is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/python3.5
import panflute as pf

def action(elem, doc):
    if isinstance(elem, pf.Strong):
        return pf.Emph(*elem.content)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pf.toJSONFilter(action)
</pre>
</p><p>
If you save this program as, say &ldquo;myfilter.py&rdquo;, you can say
<tt  >cat file | pandoc --filter myfilter.py</tt> to get
&ldquo;file&rdquo;
translated into HTML, with all the boldface turned into italics. You can
try it on the Markdown sample above and experiment with different
output formats (using the <tt  >-t</tt> flag) to verify that Pandoc will use the
correct markup for italics in each case.
</p><p>
This example embodies the basic pattern used in all Pandoc filters. The
final two lines cause the program to behave as a filter, walking through
each element in the input document and applying the &ldquo;action&rdquo;. The action
function must have the two arguments shown; the first is the current
element, and the second is the entire document. Both refer to Pandoc's
internal version of the document, after the input markup is parsed and
translated. For each element, you test whether it's boldface, which
Pandoc/panflute represents as a &ldquo;Strong&rdquo; element, and, if it is, return
its content (which can contain arbitrary arrays of other elements)
wrapped in the &ldquo;Emph&rdquo; element, which is used for italics.
</p><p>
Although Pandoc's extended version of Markdown covers most of the basic
elements that an author of technical material is likely to need, you
inevitably will wish that it had syntax for something that is not
included. There is a potentially endless number of different semantic
elements that an author might invent for a document, and no markup
language can anticipate them all. In writing for the web, we typically
extend the semantics of HTML by defining classes in CSS, for good or
ill. In LaTeX, this job usually leads to the creation of macros, which
are simple for simple cases but quickly can turn to dark magic. In
either case, we resort to inventing a presentational expression of our
semantic intent, and working out a special case for each end target that
we wish to write for.
</p><p>
Once you know how to write simple Pandoc filters, however, you can
leverage some special features of Pandoc's extended Markdown to extend
it further by creating your own customized elements. The first of these
special features that I discuss here is the ability to add arbitrary
attributes to inline code and code blocks.
</p><p>
In running text, you can indicate code, commands or similar text by
surrounding it with backticks. You usually will see this rendered in a
monospace font, and the author almost always wants it rendered literally
(no use of ligatures, for example). The Pandoc/Markdown default is to
choose the correct semantic markup for the target language, if one
exists. For example, the Markdown input <tt  >type `ls` to see a
listing</tt> is
translated into the HTML <tt  >&lt;p&gt;type &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; to see
a listing&lt;/p&gt;</tt>
(Pandoc puts fragments into paragraphs). 
</p><p>
If you want to include a full-fledged code sample, you have the choice
of several syntaxes. For our purposes here, the backtick syntax will be most
convenient: just put your code in a separate paragraph beginning and
ending with a line of three backticks.
</p><p>
Pandoc extends Markdown by allowing you to add arbitrary lists of
attributes to these elements. For our purposes, one attribute will
serve. For inline code, the syntax is <tt  >`code
fragment`{.attribute}</tt>. For
code blocks, it's even simpler (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12210f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Writing Pandoc/Markdown in Vim
</p></div></div><p>
You are allowed to place any number of spaces between the opening
backticks and the attribute name.
</p><p>
Pandoc intends these attributes to indicate the language name, and it uses
them to create syntax highlighting for HTML and LaTeX output. You might
have noticed that the input example is also syntax-highlighted. This
delightful feature is provided by the Vim editor; some details about how
to use it are at <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown" target="_self">https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown</a>.
</p><p>
You don't have to use these attributes for language names, however. Since
you can get at them through panflute filters, you can use them to extend
the language by defining your own elements. I'll give a few examples of
elements I defined for my own work.
</p><p>
Soon after I began using Pandoc, I decided I needed a way to include
comments in the text that would be passed over and not copied to the
output: a way to &ldquo;comment out&rdquo; passages. I was sure that something like
this was already part of the language, but some Googling revealed that
there was no convenient way to accomplish it. Here is how I decided to
implement this using filters. First, I decided on the name for my new
attribute: &ldquo;n&rdquo;, for &ldquo;note&rdquo;. I want to be able to
type <tt  >`ignore me`{.n}</tt>
in running text, or, for longer commented-out passages:


<pre     class="programlisting">
This is text that will be translated, but

``` n
this paragraph,
no matter what it contains,
will just disappear.
```

And we are back to regular input.
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c7580.0x27c0748"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and not see those passages in the output.
</p><p>
The filter that does this is pretty simple:


<pre     class="programlisting">
import panflute as pf

def action(elem, doc):
    if (isinstance(elem, pf.Code) or
        isinstance(elem, pf.CodeBlock)):
        if ('n' in elem.classes):
            return []

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pf.toJSONFilter(action)
</pre>
</p><p>
As before, the first line of the action function looks for inline code
or CodeBlock elements. When it finds one, it checks whether our special
"n" class is in its list of attributes, called "classes" in panflute.
The final line of the action function in a filter will be the
transformation of the element. In this case, we return an empty list,
which accomplishes what we want by simply deleting the element from the
document.
</p><p>
One important detail: you should save your panflute filters in files
that end with .py, so that Pandoc knows they are Python programs;
otherwise, it will assume they are Haskell and print a mysterious error.
You don't need a separate file for each filter; you can create multiple
filters by including all their relevant conditions in one big action
function.
</p><p>
Here's one more simple example that shows what that looks like. It also
illustrates output-specific processing: applying different
transformations depending on the target. Sometimes I want to put a
&ldquo;publication note&rdquo; at the beginning of an article on my website to
notify the reader that the article may have been updated, for example.
But, I don't want these notes to appear in a PDF (via LaTeX) version of
the article. So, I want different things to happen depending on the
output format. I call this custom element &ldquo;pubnote&rdquo;; here is the
previous filter with the pubnote rule added:


<pre     class="programlisting">

import panflute as pf

def action(elem, doc):
    if (isinstance(elem, pf.Code) or
        isinstance(elem, pf.CodeBlock)):
        if ('n' in elem.classes):
            return []
    if isinstance(elem, pf.CodeBlock):
        if 'pubnote' in elem.classes:
            if doc.format == 'html':
                return pf.convert_text(
                  '&lt;div class = "pubnote"&gt;{}&lt;/div&gt;'.format(elem.text))
            else:
                return []

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pf.toJSONFilter(action)

</pre>
</p><p>
This shows the main reason to pass the <tt  >doc</tt> argument into the action
function: it carries with it attributes global to the document as a
whole, including, in this case, the output format requested of Pandoc.
If this format is HTML, I would like the publication note simply wrapped
in a <tt  >div</tt> with a certain class, so that I can style it appropriately with
my stylesheet; if it's any other format, it can expunge it. I used the
function <tt  >convert_text</tt> to get this done; this function takes
its argument, as if it were a Pandoc input string, and passes it through
Pandoc, using the active output format. The example also shows one way
to extract the contents of an element, with its text attribute. You can
find more information about the Element class and the rest of the
panflute API at <a href="http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/code.html" target="_self">scorreia.com/software/panflute/code.html</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26c7580.0x27b75b0"></a>
Templates</h2></div></div><p>
Your document can define global variables that are carried through the
translation process until the end. I've already described one: the output
format, culled from the command-line flag, that you can access in your
filters as doc.format.
</p><p>
The panflute API extends code blocks to contain YAML data
(<a href="http://www.yaml.org/start.html" target="_self">www.yaml.org/start.html</a>). YAML is a data description language,
like XML, but less verbose and easier on the eyes. You can use this to
define named variables, right in your document, of various types,
including lists of values.
</p><p>
Here's a simple example of how I use this facility in my personal set of
filters. Sometimes I want to include a short quotation, or epigraph, at
the beginning of an article or chapter. The epigraph has two distinct
components, which are the quote itself and the person to which it is
attributed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
~~ epigraph
quote: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
who: Leonardo da Vinci
---
~~ 
</pre>
</p><p>
I can include this data block anywhere in the document. My convention
happens to be to use a row of three tildes, as you can see, but
backticks work as well. Panflute will put the variables, defined between
the start of the block and the &ldquo;---&rdquo; line, into a Python dictionary:
<tt  >&gt;{'quote': 'Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.', 'who':
'Leonardo da Vinci'}</tt>
The space between the &ldquo;---&rdquo; line and the line ending the data block is
for optional data.
</p><p>
Here is a filter that processes the &ldquo;epigraph&rdquo; blocks. It assumes HTML
output, but from the examples above, you will understand how to extend it
to handle other formats. I've used the convenience function
<tt  >yaml_filter</tt>,
which is part of panflute and handles the parsing of YAML-extended code
blocks. You pass it as an argument to the
<tt  >toJSONFilter</tt> function that
I mentioned before, along with a dictionary of tags. This dictionary
associates attribute names with which you tag your data blocks with
function names. The first argument to these filter functions will be the
dictionary of values parsed from the block, while the second will be the
optional data. The element and doc arguments are as you've seen
previously:


<pre     class="programlisting">

import panflute as pf

def epigraph(options, data, element, doc):
    return pf.convert_text(
     '&lt;div class = "epigraph"&gt;{} &lt;span class = "who"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;'
       .format(options.get('quote'), options.get('who')))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    pf.toJSONFilter(pf.yaml_filter,
       tags = {'epigraph': epigraph})

</pre>
</p><p>
You also can use the global variables from your YAML blocks in Pandoc
templates. The Pandoc examples I've given so far have involved translating
fragments of text on the command line. Once you have it installed, you
can say, for example, <tt  >echo "*Hello*, **world**" |
pandoc</tt> to
get the phrase translated into the default HTML, or into LaTeX by adding
the flag <tt  >-t latex</tt>. When creating entire documents, however, you
invariably need other material surrounding the text. For web pages,
you'll have a header linking to your site's stylesheet and probably much
more, and <tt  >body</tt> and <tt  >html</tt> tags. When using
LaTeX, you will need a preamble that defines your document class, loads
all the required packages and, quite likely, defines all your personal
macros and definitions.
</p><p>
If you supply the <tt  >--standalone</tt> flag to Pandoc, it will embed the
translated content into a default template appropriate for your chosen
output format. These templates are quite capable, including such things
as style definitions for the language-specific syntax highlighting that
I mentioned previously. However, they are rarely what you want. You 
inevitably will wind up creating your own templates for real work.
Fortunately, this is quite simple. You merely need to take whatever
template you already are using for document creation and add
placeholders for global variables defined by Pandoc and by you in your
document. These are variable names surrounded by dollar signs. The main
one, <tt  >$body$</tt>, contains the translated text of your document.
Other sources for global variables are the YAML-extended code blocks
that I introduced above, certain command-line flags, the general
flag <tt  >--variable</tt>, unnamed YAML blocks and Pandoc title
blocks. For those last two, see the Pandoc documentation
at <a href="http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html" target="_self">pandoc.org/MANUAL.html</a> for all the details. Remember to save
your templates with filename extensions that match their format: .html
for HTML and .latex for LaTeX. Here's an example of an unrealistically
simple HTML template, showing the use of two variables. It also serves
as an example of three very useful features of Pandoc's template
language: conditions, looping over variable lists and extracting fields
from variables:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html dir="ltr" lang="en-US"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta content="text/html;charset=utf-8"
      http-equiv="Content-Type" /&gt;

    &lt;title&gt;$title$&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

 &lt;h1&gt;$title$&lt;/h1&gt;

 $if(related)$
  &lt;div style = 'font-size: 0.8rem; color: green;'&gt;
   &lt;h2&gt;Related articles:&lt;/h2&gt;
   $for(related)$
    &lt;p&gt;$related.title$: $related.url$&lt;/p&gt;
   $endfor$
  &lt;/div&gt;
 $endif$

 $body$

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Here is the small Pandoc/Markdown document that I'll use as input to
this template. It begins with a standard YAML block that Pandoc uses
to populate the metadata variables used in the template automatically.
This is the syntax that panflute extends to define the YAML-extended
data blocks that I used earlier. Notice the terse yet readable syntax
for lists and variable attributes defined by YAML syntax:

Automating a Complex Document</h2></div></div><p>
Since Pandoc filters, using the panflute package, are just Python
programs, they can do more than merely modify the document translation:
they can perform any processing you desire. In particular, as Python
is a good &ldquo;glue language&rdquo;, in which it's easy to invoke external
processes and perform system functions, you can allow the document to
trigger this processing and include the results in the finished
product.
</p><p>
This final section is a case study showing how to use Pandoc filters and
templates to automate away the tedious and error-prone tasks that happen
to be involved in creating a certain complex document. I hope this
detailed example will make the principles clear, so that you take away
the ability to apply these techniques in creating your own documents,
even though they are unlikely to be similar to my particular case.
</p><p>
The example is an ebook about gnuplot (<a href="http://gnuplot.info" target="_self">gnuplot.info</a>), the
open-source plotting program. The book consists almost entirely of
example gnuplot scripts and their output, side by side, with a paragraph
or so of explanation for each example. On other words, it is similar to
a recipe book. I enforce a firm rule: each script must work as
presented, and the figure displayed with it must be the exact output of
the script. This is more troublesome than it might sound at first. One
winds up with hundreds of scripts and hundreds of image files. If I
decide to alter one of the example scripts, I must ensure that the image
printed next to it is the output of the new script and not a stale one.
I use boldface highlighting and other presentational details in the
printing of the example scripts to help the reader, but this involves
markup that can't be fed to gnuplot.
</p><p>
The system that I describe here allows me simply to type the
gnuplot scripts along with the text, adding special characters for
boldface highlighting. A collection of filters and the output template
take care of all the rest. They do the following: 1) replace my highlighting character
with the LaTeX command for boldface; 2) take care of line
continuations; 3) compute a checksum of the executable version of the
script (with formatting characters removed); 4) define a hypertarget in
the document using this checksum; 5) include the executable version of
the script in the output as a PDF attachment; 6) process the script
with gnuplot and save the resulting graph as a PNG, using the checksum
in the name, if the image file does not already exist; 7) include the
PNG in the output; and 8) create an index of plots, linking to their
locations in the book using the hypertargets in step 4.
</p><p>
Using this system, I can make alterations to the examples at will,
without having to worry about breaking anything or keeping track of what
goes where. Any change in the script will lead to a changed checksum, so
the program knows to run gnuplot on the changes and make a new figure.
After using it to help process almost 200 pages of text, it's pretty
well tested, and I feel that the time spent setting it up was well worth
the resulting savings in headaches and tedium, allowing me to
concentrate on the more enjoyable aspects of writing the book. In
addition to the above, there are extra steps for those gnuplot examples
that create animations. In that case, another filter creates a set of
animation frames, and the system uses ImageMagick
(<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php" target="_self">www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php</a>) to stitch them together
into a movie. It creates a poster frame for the movie, attaches the
movie to the PDF, copies the movie file to the publisher's server and
creates a link to the movie file in the book.
</p><p>
Using the techniques for writing filters and templates described above,
you already know how to construct a system like this. The only new idea
here is using the Python filter to call out to external programs.
</p><p>
Here is the markup for one of the examples in the book. I wrap the
gnuplot script in a code block with a <tt  >gnc</tt> attribute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
```gnc
@set xrange [-pi : pi]@
plot sin(x)
```
</pre>
</p><p>
The @ characters are used to delimit what I want printed in boldface.
The following shows the filter function that processes these
code blocks:


<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/python3.5
import panflute as pf
import subprocess
c = subprocess.run
import re
import zlib
import os



def action(elem, doc):
    if isinstance(elem, pf.CodeBlock):
        if 'gnc' in elem.classes:
            # pff will hold the checksum
            pff = str(zlib.adler32(bytes(elem.text.replace('@', ''),
             &#8618;'utf-8')))
            #The name used for the
            #gnuplot output image:
            pfn = pff + '.png'
            #Check if we've done this one:
            if pfn not in os.listdir():
                dscript = elem.text.replace('@', '')
                script = '''set term pngcairo\nset out
                 &#8618;"{}"\n{}'''.format(pfn, dscript)
                with open(pff + '.gn', 'w') as scriptfile:
                    scriptfile.write(dscript)
                #Execute gnuplot on the script:
                c('''echo '{}' | gnuplot'''.format(script), shell = True)
            if doc.format == 'latex':
                #Lots of escaping needed:
                mt = elem.text.replace('{', '\\{')
                mt = mt.replace('}', '\\}')
                #LaTeX boldface:
                mt = re.sub('@(.*?)@', r'\\textbf{\1}', mt)
                mt = mt.replace('\\\n', '\\textbackslash\n')
                #for newlines in gnuplot labels, etc.

                mt = mt.replace('\\\\n', '\\textbackslash{n}')
                return pf.RawBlock(
                '\n\hypertarget{'+pff+'}{}\\begin{Verbatim}\n'+mt+
                '\n\end{Verbatim}\n\\textattachfile[mimetype=text/'
                +'plain]{' + pff + '.gn}{' + '\\framebox'+'
                {Open script}}\n\plt{' + pfn + '}',
                format = 'latex')
            else:
                return [elem, pf.RawBlock(
                    '&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt = "" src = "' + pfn + '" /&gt;',
                    format = 'html')]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pf.toJSONFilter(action)
</pre>
</p><p>
I've pointed out the key steps in code comments. The filter inserts code
in the output, such as <tt  >\plt</tt>, that refers to macros defined
in the final template. These are simple affairs that handle some
formatting, such as inserting page breaks and including the figures at
the correct width. The code imports the zlib package for the checksums
and uses the subprocess module to run external programs. It performs
filesystem operations using the included os module. The filter inserts
commands to use the LaTeX <tt  >attachfile</tt> package to make PDF
attachments, which I include in my output template. The
<tt  >RawBlock</tt>s are a panflute data structure for
&ldquo;raw text&rdquo; and
must include the intended output format as a second argument.

Figure 3. A Fragment from the Book
</p></div></div><p>
And, finally, here is a fragment of the LaTeX source corresponding to
the book fragment, where you can see how the code checksum is used:


<pre     class="programlisting">
\hypertarget{setting-ranges}{\subsection{Setting
Ranges}\label{setting-ranges}}

That was simple. Notice how gnuplot decided to plot
our function from -10 to +10. That's the default,
which we got because we didn't ask for any
particular range. Gnuplot also set the y-axis
limits (the range of the vertical axis) to
encompass the range of the function over that
default x-axis domain. Let's take control of the
limits on the horizontal axis (the new command is
highlighted). Gnuplot happens to know what &pi; is
(but doesn't know any other transcendental
numbers).


\hypertarget{3260812063}{}\begin{Verbatim}
\textbf{set xrange [-pi : pi]}
plot sin(x)
\end{Verbatim}

\plt{3260812063.png}
</pre>

You can use similar techniques to write filters and templates for
anything imaginable: perhaps processing images, creating logs, using the
results of calculations within documents, checking links or
incorporating information scraped from websites. You can trigger all of
these actions through markup that you define to extend Pandoc's Markdown
language, using the panflute API.
</p><p>
I've found that Pandoc, used with Python-programmed filter functions, is
a powerful system for authoring complex documents. I routinely translate
single input files to HTML, PDF (through LaTeX) and docx for Word-using
publishers, with no additional work. For those of us who write for a
variety of publications, or simply want to be able to repurpose our
manuscripts on occasion, a workflow based on Pandoc is the Holy Grail of
authoring systems.
