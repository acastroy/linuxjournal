Learn how to turn the Banana Pi into a great low-cost, low-power local
network backup server.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xd9c580.0xe94408"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In the September 2016 issue, I wrote an article called &ldquo;Papa's Got a Brand New
NAS&rdquo;
where I described how I replaced my rackmounted gear with a small,
low-powered ARM device&mdash;the Odroid XU4. Before I settled on that
solution,
I tried out a few others including a pair of Banana Pi computers&mdash;small
single-board computers like Raspberry Pis only with gigabit networking
and SATA2 controllers on board. In the end, I decided to go with a
single higher-powered board and use a USB3 disk enclosure with RAID
instead of building a cluster of Banana Pis that each had a single disk
attached. Since I had two Banana Pis left over after this experiment,
I decided to put them to use, so in this article, I describe how I
turned one into a nice little backup server.

The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Although Raspberry Pis are incredibly popular and useful if you want a small,
low-powered, cheap computer, they have their downsides as network
backup servers. One of the main downsides is low-performance disk and
network speeds. A Raspberry Pi maxes out at 100Mbit on the network and
offers only USB2 ports if you want to add a hard drive. Those limitations
are what drove me to look for other solutions for my home NAS in the first
place, and it's one area where a Banana Pi has an edge. Even though the
modern Raspberry Pi 3 has a faster CPU, the old Banana Pi still beats
it on network and disk I/O. This makes it pretty ideal as a standalone
system for home network backups, depending on your needs.
</p><p>
In my case, I'm not backing up terabytes of media; I just wanted bare-metal
backups of my servers and workstations along with backups of important
documents. The size of your backups is important, because the Banana Pi
is limited to a single SATA2 port, and the board itself can power
only a 2.5" laptop drive. So if you want to stick with local power, you are limited
to 2.5" hard drive sizes. That said, if you were willing to splurge on an
externally powered SATA2 enclosure, you could use a 3.5" drive instead. In
my case, I happened to have an old 2.5" 500Gb laptop drive lying around
that I had since replaced with an SSD. Note that you probably will need to
order the appropriate SATA2 cable to connect your hard drive with your
Banana Pi&mdash;it doesn't typically come with the board.
</p><p>
Although I imagine you could just have the board and a laptop drive sitting
on a shelf, I wanted to protect it a bit more than that. Since I have a
3D printer, naturally I went to Thingiverse to see if it had any cases
for a Banana Pi. It turns out someone made just the thing I needed&mdash;a
Banana Pi case that also had mounting points for a 2.5" hard drive. I
printed out the case (in yellow, naturally) and was able to mount the
board and the laptop drive without any issues.

The Software</h2></div></div><p>
I've been a fan of BackupPC as a backup solution for many years. It's
available for just about any Linux distribution, supports SMB and
rsync-based backups, and it provides a nice web interface to make it easy
for users to navigate to their own backups and perform their own restores
without having to involve an administrator. What's more, it's smart about
combining full and incremental backups, and it takes advantage of hard links
and compression so that it's very efficient with disk space. You can end
up storing weeks of backups without taking much more space than one
full backup might consume.
</p><p>
BackupPC already was packaged for the Debian-based distribution made
for the Banana Pi, so it was easy to install. In my case, I already
had been using BackupPC on my previous server, so I was able to copy
over my configuration and backup archive to this new server, and I was
ready to go. Obviously, in your case, you will want to follow BackupPC's
documentation to add your own user accounts and backup jobs. It's pretty
straightforward, and you can configure it both purely on the command line
with configuration files or through the web UI.
</p><p>
I did make one tweak to my previous BackupPC configuration file for
the Banana Pi. It turns out that the Banana Pi has a green LED on the
board that you can control from Linux. The LED is bright enough that
I was able to see it through the translucent plastic lid I printed for
my case, so I thought it would be handy to turn it on whenever a backup
was in progress. I ended up creating two basic scripts to control the
LED. First, I created /usr/local/bin/led_on:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/leds/bananapi\:green\:usr/brightness
</pre>
</p><p>
Then I created a corresponding /usr/local/bin/led_off script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash

echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/leds/bananapi\:green\:usr/brightness
</pre>
</p><p>
I then used <tt  >chmod +x</tt> to add execute permissions to both of these scripts
and tested them out with sudo (you need root privileges to write to that
device), and sure enough, the LED turned off and on.
</p><p>
To make BackupPC use these scripts, first I had to make sure the local
backuppc user could execute them as root, so I added the following line
to my /etc/sudoers file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
backuppc ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/led_on, 
 &#8618;/usr/local/bin/led_off
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, I modified my /etc/backuppc/config.pl file to set the led_on
script as a command BackupPC would run before it started a backup
and led_off to be run after a backup completed. To turn the LED on, I
changed the following BackupPC configuration settings:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$Conf{DumpPreUserCmd}     = 'sudo /usr/local/bin/led_on';
$Conf{DumpPreShareCmd}    = 'sudo /usr/local/bin/led_on';
$Conf{RestorePreUserCmd}  = 'sudo /usr/local/bin/led_on';
$Conf{ArchivePreUserCmd}  = 'sudo /usr/local/bin/led_on';
</pre>
</p><p>
And to turn the LED back off, I updated the corresponding post-backup
settings:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$Conf{DumpPostUserCmd}    = 'sudo /usr/local/bin/led_off';
$Conf{DumpPostShareCmd}   = 'sudo /usr/local/bin/led_off';
$Conf{RestorePostUserCmd} = 'sudo /usr/local/bin/led_off';
$Conf{ArchivePostUserCmd} = 'sudo /usr/local/bin/led_off';
</pre>
</p><p>
Once I reloaded the BackupPC service, the LEDs worked great, and I could
tell at a glance whether a backup was in progress. The nice thing about
this setup for local backups is that it draws very little power and is
silent apart from the noise from the hard drive.
