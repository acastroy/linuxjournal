Chasing Carrots' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pressure Overdrive</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
A &ldquo;funky, four-wheeled shoot 'em up&rdquo; is how independent
game-developer Chasing Carrots describes its newest game release
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pressure Overdrive</em></span> for Linux, Mac OS, Windows and Xbox. Shifting to a
higher gear from its high-octane 2013 predecessor,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pressure</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pressure
Overdrive</em></span> seeks a wider audience with a fast-paced mix of humor and action,
classic couch co-op fun and constant car crashes in colorful environments.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pressure Overdrive</em></span> takes players on a wild ride as they fight against the
evil Count Soap, who has stolen the water out of nearby surrounding rivers
to fill his gigantic &ldquo;Uber-Spa&rdquo;. As pilots of steam-powered and
heavily armed buggies, players must ram and blast their way through hordes
of wacko enemies, including a string of powerful bosses. Between missions,
players bling up their ride with a variety of upgrades and customization
options. Other novelties in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pressure Overdrive</em></span> include a new twin stick
control scheme, additional weapons, new upgrade paths, an endless mode and
couch co-op for playing with friends. Rounding out the new feature set is a
new tutorial level that helps players ease themselves into the game.

Caldwell Partners' Cyber Advisory Board Service</h2></div></div><p>
For many enterprises, cyber risk is the top business risk. Meanwhile,
there is simply not a sufficiently large talent pool of cyber-risk
professionals to satisfy the ever-growing demand. To assuage this business
challenge, executive search firm Caldwell Partners announced the launch of
its Cyber Advisory Board service, a means for companies to 
obtain the level of expertise they require to implement industry
best practices quickly and effectively. Caldwell Partners' new service allows enterprises to

and under-qualified candidates. Companies obtain access to a Cyber Advisory
Board of recognized cyber industry leaders, tailored to fit needs the needs
of a particular company and its industry. This solution is especially
helpful for clients who opt for step-up candidates or deploy trusted
executives open to a career change into cyber security. The advisory board
provides a range of services&mdash;from mentoring a company's CISO to helping
develop cyber strategy to educating the company's C-level executives and
boards, all the way to giving guidance on best practices with regard to
cyber breach responses. A Cyber Advisory Board provides deep expertise and
consistency and satisfies increased governance on public company boards
faced with regulators who exert ever greater pressure on companies to
demonstrate a commitment to best practices.

Paragon Software Group's Paragon ExtFS for Mac</h2></div></div><p>
Ever more Mac aficionados are discovering the virtues of Linux, especially
when their older hardware can experience a renaissance. One annoying
barrier to dual-boot nirvana is filesystem incompatibility, whereby the
Linux side can access the Mac side, but Apple's macOS doesn't
support Linux drives at all&mdash;not even in read-only mode. A handy solution
is Paragon Software Group's Paragon ExtFS for Mac, a low-level macOS
filesystem driver designed to eliminate filesystem incompatibility
between Linux and Mac operating systems. The solution grants transparent
read/write access to ExtFS Linux partitions on macOS, allowing Mac users to
access files fully that are stored on Linux volumes hassle-free, streamline data
sharing and transfer up to 4GB+ files at a high rate. The new 11th edition
of ExtFS for Mac features a completely new UI and advanced features,
including extended mounting options and a menu bar app allowing users
one-click access to all ExtFS drives and instant execution of the most
common volume operations&mdash;for example, volume mount, unmount and verify. Large
volume support enables mounting volumes more than 2TB in size. ExtFS for Windows
also is available from the company.

V. Anton Spraul's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Think Like a Programmer</em></span>, Python
Edition</h2></div></div><p>
What is programming? Sure, it consists of syntax and the assembly of code,
but it is essentially a means to solve problems. To study programming,
then, is to study the art of problem solving, and a new book from V.
Anton Spraul, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Think Like a Programmer</em></span>, Python Edition, is a guide to
sharpening skills in both spheres. Subtitled <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Beginner's Guide to
Programming and Problem Solving</em></span>, Spraul's book helps transition
programmers in training from reading programs to writing them in
Python. No prior programming experience required! Rather than simply
point out solutions to problems, Spraul gets readers thinking
by illustrating techniques that instruct how to self-solve programming
problems. Each chapter covers a single programming concept, such as data
types, control flow, code reuse, recursion and classes, topped off by a
series of Python-based exercises that put readers' skills to the test.
In <span   class="emphasis"><em>Think Like a Programmer, Python Edition</em></span>, readers break big problems down
into simple, manageable steps to build into solutions, write custom
functions to solve new problems, use a debugger to examine each line of a
running program in order to understand fully how it works and tackle
problems strategically by turning each new concept into a problem-solving
tool. Additional chapters are included on early programming topics, such as
variables, decisions and looping.

eCos&mdash;which means the &ldquo;Embedded Configurable Operating
System&rdquo;&mdash;is an
open-source RTOS for deeply embedded applications. Deployed in a diversity
of markets and devices, eCos' popularity is a result of a variety of
commercial and technical advantages over competing RTOS offerings. The

StarNet Communications Corp's FastX</h2></div></div><p>
WebAssembly browser technology is important for making the browser go
beyond what JavaScript can do. StarNet Communications Corp says it is the
first to plant a WebAssembly flag in the EDA space by integrating
WebAssembly technology into its FastX remote Linux display solution. The
addition is part of StarNet's new FastX 2.4 release, which the company
promises will provide EDA engineers with a significant browser client
performance upgrade, particularly with video and graphics applications, such
as Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) tools used in semiconductor design. The
integration of WebAssembly improves in-browser client-side scripting by
executing instructions natively rather than through an interpreter, such
that Linux applications through a browser will run at near native speed.
Browsers with support for WebAssembly include Firefox, Chrome, Safari and
Edge. Besides the performance upgrade, users also will enjoy an updated UI,
optimizations for operating in cloud environments and additions to the
admin toolset, namely several new RDP Protocol extensions to help reduce
bandwidth consumption, simplified upgrades and installation and an Advanced
Windows Management system.
