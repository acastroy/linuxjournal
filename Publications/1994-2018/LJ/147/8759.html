A tutorial on the holistic approach to securing OpenSSH.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe9580.0xce13a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you are a systems administrator of one or more Linux/UNIX systems, OpenSSH is likely one of the most important tools in your toolbox.
OpenSSH can be used interactively or embedded in scripts to provide
secure remote access and file transfer between systems. But, alas, danger
lies ahead. With OpenSSH, it is perilously easy to create sloppy trust
relationships or, worse, leave yourself open to common automated attacks.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe9580.0xce14a8"></a>
Basic Security</h2></div></div><p>
One of the basic tenets of system security has always been to run only
the minimum required services and limit their access only to those
who need it. Linux systems make this pretty easy to do, and like most
things in the *nix world, you can do it in a number of ways. If you're
still reading this article, we assume you need to run
OpenSSH. Let's work on limiting access.
</p><p>
On most Linux distributions, you
have the choice of handling this at the kernel firewall level or using TCP
Wrappers (/etc/hosts.{allow|deny} files).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe9580.0xce1608"></a>
iptables</h2></div></div><p>
A simple iptables firewall
rule to limit OpenSSH only to your local subnet could be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
iptables -A INPUT -s ! 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0
&#8618;-p tcp -m tcp --dport 22 -j REJECT --reject-with
&#8618;icmp-port-unreachable
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells the kernel to reject any TCP/IP packets not coming
from a specific subnet aimed at port 22. (Substitute your own
numbers as needed.) In all likelihood, you will have additional iptables
rules to protect other applications on this system, so integrate the
above into your overall firewall design.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe9580.0xce17c0"></a>TCP Wrappers</h2></div></div><p>
TCP Wrappers is a common feature on most Linux distributions, and OpenSSH
has built-in support. To implement the same rule above using TCP
Wrappers, add the following line to your /etc/hosts.deny file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sshd: ALL EXCEPT 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0
</pre>
</p><p>
For most situations, it is very unlikely that OpenSSH needs to be dangling
out for the world-wild Internet to poke at. Further, it is unlikely
that OpenSSH even needs to be available to your entire organization.
I highly recommend that access be limited, using either of the above
methods, to the smallest audience possible. One common method is to
designate one or more systems specifically for the purpose of centralized
administration. Configure the rest of your systems to accept
OpenSSH connections only from these dedicated and highly secured systems.
</p><p>
To test whether you have limited access to OpenSSH successfully, you can try
to connect using an ssh client, or simply connect to the system using a
command-line telnet client, for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ telnet mylinuxbox 22
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe9580.0xce1a28"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where mylinuxbox is the hostname, and 22 is the port.
</p><p>
If OpenSSH is responding and open, you should see something like the
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.9p1
</pre>
</p><p>
If it is successfully blocked, the connection will be refused. Try this
from multiple locations, and confirm that connections are blocked as
you expect.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe9580.0xce1c38"></a>
Avoiding Automated Attacks</h2></div></div><p>
Over the years, OpenSSH has had a few remotely exploitable vulnerabilities
due to bugs. These always have been fixed quickly, with updated
versions distributed promptly. Unfortunately, a lot of networked systems
are not updated. Also, many systems simply are poorly secured.
Standard accounts with simple or blank passwords are depressingly
commonplace.
</p><p>
All of these are tantalizing targets for crackers and worm authors.
A number of malicious worms exist that scan for any
SSH servers and then try common vulnerabilities and passwords. If you must
have your OpenSSH port open to the world, consider changing its TCP port
number. This can be accomplished by changing the Port directive in
the sshd_config file, which is commonly in /etc/ssh/. Although any live
person trying to crack your systems would likely have little difficulty
detecting this, it is usually enough to escape the attention of large-scale automated attacks and worms.
</p><p>
Also, you might consider rebuilding your OpenSSH from sources after
modifying the version string. This also can help confuse automated
attacks, because many vulnerabilities are dependent on specific versions
of OpenSSH. This is done by modifying the version.h file in the OpenSSH
distribution and recompiling. Change the SSH_VERSION and SSH_PORTABLE
#define lines to anything you like, such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#define SSH_VERSION     "MyCompany_Vers00001"
#define SSH_PORTABLE    "foo"
</pre>
</p><p>
After changing the sources, build and install.	This changes the
version banner shown in the above telnet test.
</p><p>
Changing the port and version string does
<span   class="emphasis"><em>nothing</em></span> to improve security; they simply reduce the risk of being the
victim of a common exploit or worm. There is no substitute for securing
accounts and making sure your systems are running the latest patch
levels of software. If you are using Linux, use a current distribution.
Use automated update tools like yum, apt or up2date to keep your system
running the latest version of all software and libraries including
OpenSSH.
</p><p>
You can confirm that users are selecting good passwords
by using a cracking tool like John the Ripper (see the on-line Resources). John
the Ripper (JTR) uses the one-way encrypted passwords in /etc/shadow
to try to crack passwords. Generally speaking, easier passwords
cracked by JTR are more likely to show up in a brute-force
dictionary attack commonly used by some worms. JTR supports a wide
range of input file formats for those using LDAP, NIS, AFS Kerberos
and other authentication services.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe9580.0xce1fa8"></a>
Avoid Using Passwords</h2></div></div><p>
If possible, stop using passwords for remote logins. You can
accomplish this by setting up trust relationships using public key
authentication. These trust relationships can be set up between any
two user accounts, on the same system or across the network.
</p><p>
The first step to setting up one of these relationships is to create a private
and public key, known as a key pair. Each key is stored
in a separate file. By convention, the filenames are the same, but
the public key file has an extra .pub extension. The private key
stays secret and usually remains in the home directory of the account
that will initiate the connection.
</p><p>
OpenSSH will refuse to use any private
key file with lax file permissions. To form the trust relationship, the
public key is appended to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file (usual location
on most Linux builds of OpenSSH) on the destination side of the
trust relationship. The authorized_keys file contains all the public
keys trusted by the owner's account. These keys can be secured
further by providing a passphrase, which is used to encrypt the private key.
If a passphrase is specified, it needs to be provided before the
private key can be used to make a connection. In the example below,
we create a trust relationship between two accounts, account1
on a system named localbox and account2 on a system named remotebox.
</p><p>
Create account1's key pair (we will specify a passphrase when asked). The
passphrase is not actually displayed as you type it, but it is shown below
for demonstration. We specify that the pair should be based on a 2048-bit
private key (the default is 1024, which recently has been proven to be
much easier to crack):
</p><pre     class="programlisting">

[account1@localbox account1]$ ssh-keygen  -t rsa -b 2048
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/account1/.ssh/id_rsa):
&lt;ENTER&gt;
Created directory '/home/account1/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
This%%%Is%%%My%%%Passphrase&lt;ENTER&gt;
Enter same passphrase again:
This%%%Is%%%My%%%Passphrase&lt;ENTER&gt;
Your identification has been saved in /home/account1/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/account1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
63:9f:75:d5:80:93:67:5e:d8:69:5a:69:69:4f:a0:76 account1@localbox

</pre><p>
This created the two key files /home/account1/.ssh/id_rsa
and /home/account1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. Now, we copy the public key
to account2@remotebox. You can do this with any method you find convenient.
We use scp to copy the file, and then use cat to append to it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[account1@localbox account1]$ scp /home/account1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
 &#8618;account2@remotebox:./account1.id_rsa.pub
account2@remotebox's password:
id_rsa.pub            100%  243   538.1KB/s   00:00
</pre>
</p><p>
Now we append account1's public key to account2's authorized_key file
and set proper permissions on files:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[account2@remotebox account2]$ mkdir ~/.ssh
[account2@remotebox account2]$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
[account2@remotebox account2]$ cat account1.id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt;
&#8618;~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[account2@remotebox account2]$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[account2@remotebox account2]$ rm account1.id_rsa.pub
[account2@remotebox account2]$ ls -l ~/.ssh/
-rw-------  1 account2 account2 243 Dec  9 09:42 authorized_keys
</pre>
</p><p>
By placing the public key on the destination account2, we prove the
identity of account1 when it tries to connect. As you can see below,
we are prompted for the passphrase when we make the connection:

<pre     class="programlisting">

[account1@localbox account1]$ ssh account2@remotebox
Enter passphrase for key '/home/account1/.ssh/id_rsa':
This%%%Is%%%My%%%Passphrase&lt;ENTER&gt;
[account2@remotebox account2]$

</pre>
</p><p>
After the basic trust relationship is set up, you can disable password
authentication by locking the password using the passwd command and the
-l option.
</p><p>
You can restrict this trust further by adding options to the
authorized_keys file. In the example below, we include the from= option
to add host-based checking, so the private key will be accepted only from
predefined network addresses. We also add the command= option, which specifies the one and only command that will be executed after
authentication to the remote account. This feature is most useful from
inside scripts to create special-purpose trust relationships to automate
tasks between systems or accounts:

<pre     class="programlisting">

[account2@kettle account2]$ cat  .ssh/authorized_keys
from="localbox",command="/bin/df -k" ssh-rsa
AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEA54Q3QZLkpRaNN83WUMBGBE+
/xZ88ud+SlM74awZa8P6H3TNcEnrb3Lti58bsgjl3z0W5DXWvNRgszo
QeBJYNVHlsVIUCp0VjVr7aDUn0PiUVI2y658XBlbup5+isgMNuyB7Bs
kVKs9aWYQNCbJVoNo+3wcvA9x+De5Z7yBapi6E= account1@localbox

[account1@localbox account1]$ ssh  account2@remotebox
Enter passphrase for key '/home/account1/.ssh/id_rsa':
This%%%Is%%%My%%%Passphrase&lt;ENTER&gt;
10:32:15  up 8 days, 15:13, 16 users,  load average: 0.15, 0.12, 0.09
Connection to remotebox closed.
[account1@localbox account1]$

</pre>
</p><p>
After the uptime command is executed, we are immediately dropped back
to account1. This relationship is now locked in to performing
only one operation. This could be a single command, script or a restricted
shell. The command= option can be used to allow certain users to perform
selected elevated privilege operations in a controlled manner. Similar
functionality can be gained using tools like sudo, but OpenSSH allows
these operations over the network, which is useful in some circumstances.
If you have problems with any of these examples, you can run ssh with
debugging turned on, using the -vvv command-line option. This usually
helps in figuring out what is going wrong; most commonly, file
permissions cause OpenSSH to ignore key files.
</p><p>
To facilitate the use of public key authentication in scripts, you can
create a key pair for each remote operation and then specify which one to use
by invoking ssh with the -i option and the filename of the private key.
</p><p>
For interactive sessions, you can use a program called ssh-agent to
cache your decrypted private keys in memory, so you need to provide
the passphrase only once. On some Linux distributions, ssh-agent is already
hooked into the login process to start automatically. If so, all you have
to do is use ssh-add to cache your private keys. If you are interested
in ssh-agent, take a look at the ssh-agent and ssh-add man pages for
detailed explanation of their uses.
</p><p>
One final comment about public key authentication: with the price and
ease of use of modern USB Flash drives, you can consider keeping your
passphrase-protected private keys on removable media rather than in your
home directory. This lets you use them from multiple locations
while maintaining only one copy.

OpenSSH Options</h2></div></div><p>
OpenSSH has a number of configuration options that can be employed to
reduce risk. Most Linux distributions come with good middle-of-the-road
settings. In some cases, these can be adjusted for better security.
These include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Logging: turn up the logging level to INFO or DEBUG. Examine your logs
on a regular basis, or better yet, implement one of the many available
log analysis tools to notify you of anomalies:

<pre     class="programlisting">
LogLevel INFO
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Privilege separation: make sure the UsePrivilegeSeparation option
is enabled:

<pre     class="programlisting">
UsePrivilegeSeparation yes
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Protocol: limit OpenSSH to accept only protocol version 2:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Protocol 2
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Root logins: prevent root logins using passwords. This limits root
access only to nonpassword methods like public key authentication.
If you never directly log in as root, set this to no. You always
can log in as a regular user and <tt  >su</tt> to root or use sudo. Setting this
to without-password allows only nonpassword methods, such as public key
authentication:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PermitRootLogin without-password
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
File permissions: make sure StrictModes is enabled to prevent the use of
insecure home directory and key file permissions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
StrictModes yes
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Reverse name checking: require OpenSSH to check proper reverse hostname
lookups. Note that you must have proper name lookups working (that is,
DNS or /etc/hosts):

<pre     class="programlisting">
VerifyReverseMapping yes
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Prevent port forwarding: these two options prevent OpenSSH from setting
up TCP port and X11 forwarding; if you do not need these features,
disable them:

<pre     class="programlisting">
AllowTcpForwarding no
X11Forwarding no
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Disable all host-based authentication: always make sure these are
disabled. These methods assume that the network can be trusted and
allow .rhosts-style authentication based on hostname or IP. Never use
these methods as primary authentication:

<pre     class="programlisting">
IgnoreRhosts yes
HostbasedAuthentication no
RhostsAuthentication no
RhostsRSAAuthentication no
</pre>
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xbe9580.0xfede40"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Using the above suggestions, you will be able to tighten access controls
and eliminate sloppy trust relationships. As I mentioned earlier, staying
current with updates or patches is critical to system security. In order
to stay current, you need to be informed of when updates are released, so I
suggest a multipronged approach. First, automate apt, yum or up2date
to check nightly and report on missing updates. Second, subscribe to
your Linux distribution's security mailing lists. Third, subscribe to one
of the many security discussion groups, such as SecurityFocus. If you build
OpenSSH from sources, join the OpenSSH mailing list to watch for updates.
</p><p>
System security requires a holistic approach. The methodologies provided
in this article form the basis for securing OpenSSH, one small
component of a modern complex Linux system.
</p><p>
After you believe you have secured your system, use scanning tools like
the free Nessus Vulnerability Scanner (see Resources) and peer review
from colleagues to check your work.
