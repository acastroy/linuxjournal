David Heinemeier Hansson is the creator of Rails and a partner at
37signals. He'll soon be moving from Copenhagen to Chicago as he
leaves his place of birth to join the company headquarters.
</p><p>
The interview:
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em><i>LJ</i>: For our readers who are unfamiliar with Ruby and Rails, can
you give us a short description of what they are and what makes
them different from other development environments?</em></span>
</p><p>
DH: Ruby is a dynamic and object-oriented programming language created
in 1995 by Yukihiro Matsumoto. It has been described as a cross
between Smalltalk and Perl, but I don't think that juxtaposition
does it justice. Ruby is, more than anything else, a language for
writing beautiful code that makes programmers happy.
</p><p>
Rails, then, is an attempt to mold the beauty and productiveness of
Ruby into a solution for Web applications. We've sought to adhere
to the same core principle that guided the development of Ruby:
make the programmer happy!
</p><p>
This might all sound mighty fluffy, but only until you recognize
that the single-most important factor in programmer productivity is
motivation. And, happy programmers are certainly motivated
programmers. Thus, if you optimize for happiness, you're optimizing
for motivation, which ultimately leads to an optimization for
productivity.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: What is Rails? Why was it developed?</em></span>
</p><p>
DH: Rails is an extraction from a solution to a real problem. It's not
a science project. It's not something clever men sat down and
designed in the highest of ivory towers. It's simply the generic
pieces that were left after I tried to use Ruby to create
Basecamp&mdash;the Web-based project management system from 37signals.
</p><p>
That means it's a very pragmatic, very targeted framework with a
strong sense of direction. You might not share its vision, but it
undeniably has one. I like to call that opinionated software. And
Rails sure has a lot of opinions.
</p><p>
From one point of view, it could be said to be the collection of
opinions I have about how Web applications should be
constructed. Surely you can use Ruby on Rails without sharing
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
my opinions on how to create Web applications, but the more
opinions you share, the less work is put upon you.
</p><p>
And, these opinions are surprisingly simple. They aim to give most
people most of what they want, most of the time. It's a strong
disagreement with the conventional wisdom that everything should be
configurable, that the framework should be impartial and objective.
In my mind, that's the same as saying that everything should be
equally hard.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: I've been reading about Active Record and the ORM (Object-Relational
Mapping)
capabilitites (or how the application interfaces
with databases) that are available using Ruby on Rails. Can you
comment on this?</em></span>
</p><p>
DH: Active Record has, by many, been called the crown of Rails. Its core
mission is to make relational data mesh seamlessly with an object-oriented domain model. And to do so with a minimum of explicit
configuration.
</p><p>
So, you'll have a Person class that's automatically mapped to a
people table (notice the cases and pluralization that Rails
automatically figures out). This Person class will then have a
first_name method if the people table has a first_name column. So,
we're using reflection and conventions to escape the XML situps
that plague frameworks of the old world.
</p><p>
Although the lack of explicit configuration scores high points with
the Enterprise crowd used to Hibernate, EJBs and other Java
frameworks, it's the mere notion of ORM that wins big with the
PHP/.NET crowd. Active Record relieves you from the vast majority
of all SQL writing. It's automatically constructed on the fly. No
more three-line INSERTs, no more repetitive, tedious UPDATEs. The
only SQL left is the bottleneck-clearing work where actual
brainpower is involved on how to make this query go really fast.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: For many of our readers to adopt Ruby and Rails (or convince
their management to let them), they need real success stories.
Where has Ruby and Rails been used to build scalable, production
applications?</em></span>
</p><p>
DH: Ruby on Rails has been a huge hit inside a lot of organizations. We
have some 400 people signed up as working either partially or
completely in a Rails-related job. So, like an iceberg, the bulk of
the action happens below the surface.
</p><p>
But, we do have a good number of public success stories too. My own
company, 37signals, has four widely popular applications used by
hundreds of thousands to manage their projects (Basecamp), their
personal life (Backpack), their to-do lists (Ta-Da List) and their
collaborative writing (Writeboard). That suite has been the
number-one poster child for Ruby on Rails and has helped win over a lot of
doubters.
</p><p>
But 37signals is by no means the only small team doing big things
with Ruby
on Rails. The Robot Co-op has a suite of social networks that
includes 43things, 43places and 43people. Together, these networks
push more than two and a half million dynamic page views a day across
their three-machine setup.
</p><p>
Odeo is running Ruby on Rails to power its podcasting portal in
front of thousands of subscribers. Evan Williams created Blogger
and knows a thing or two about running a huge, public site. He's at
the wheel at Odeo.
</p><p>
Strongspace is just one of several Rails applications in the making
from TextDrive. They provide gigabytes of secure hosting in the
sky. It's a really cool and smooth site by the same guys that carry the
title of being the official Rails hosting firm.
</p><p>
And, that's just a small taste. We have major applications in
everything from e-commerce to productivity to content&mdash;you name
it. There are very few kinds of Web applications left that Rails hasn't
been used to create.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: By the way, I've been a Backpack user for a while and I love it.
Was it completely developed using Rails?</em></span>
</p><p>
DH: Backpack is indeed 100% Ruby on Rails. When it launched, it was a
mere 2,000 lines of code.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: Java had been around for a while before it really penetrated
the enterprise. It took the development of J2EE for it to
establish itself as a true &ldquo;enterprise development platform&rdquo;. The
addition of transactional management, flexible deployment
strategies and so on seemed required for it to mature into that role.
Could you see Ruby and Rails eventually following a similar path, or do you think its role will be something different?</em></span>
</p><p>
DH: We have a wide enterprise audience that uses Rails simply because
it gets the job done, faster. I think we've seen the peak of Java
in the enterprise. I'm sensing an understanding that while Java and
the J2EE gang certainly has its uses in legacy integration, huge
distributed setups that require two-phase commits and so on, it's
way overkill for the majority of applications created in the
enterprise.
</p><p>
Dave Thomas from the Pragmatic Programmers recently expressed this
as &ldquo;cracking nuts with a sledgehammer&rdquo;. Yes, a few special jobs
do need sledgehammers. But you don't need to use it [a sledgehammer]
for all the other jobs that need to get done.
</p><p>
That's why having a company standard on something like Java and
J2EE seems so nonsensical. Why would you use the heaviest and
slowest machinery to solve the 80% of the business that would
rather have its valuable software two, three, five or ten times faster?
Or, whatever the multiplier is in your environment. So, keep the big
guns in store for that last 20% that actually requires it.
</p><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: Is there anything else you think is important to tell our
readers about Ruby and Rails?</em></span>
</p><p>
DH: Give it a try! We've fought hard to make Ruby on Rails the easiest
Web-application framework to try out. Get Ruby, get RubyGems
(the apt-get of Ruby libraries), gem install rails, rails
my_application, and you have your application skeleton running and
ready to produce.
</p><p>
It's hard to relay in words just how fast and easy it is to get
started. So, I would invite your readers to check out the 15-minute
video on the Rails Web site where we build a complete, if simple,
blogging engine.
