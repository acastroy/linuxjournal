Dynamic languages, formerly known as scripting or glue languages,
always have been a valuable tool in every serious enterprise developer's
toolbox. In the past, hordes of programmers have used Perl, Python,
Tcl and the like to integrate disparate databases, message queues,
LDAP repositories, Web services and so on. But, there's a new kid on
the block called Ruby. In this article, I show how to solve
common enterprise integration problems much more quickly and elegantly than
with any other programming language available today.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ad580.0x1aa53f8"></a>
A Real Enterprise Integration Problem</h2></div></div><p>
To make things more tangible, let's solve a typical real-world problem.
A provider of mobile telecom services wants to offer a new tariff based
on the user's geographical position. People pay a lower fee
when they use their cell phones within a radius of 500 meters around
their home address.
</p><p>
To fulfill this requirement, the team developing the billing application
needs a new HTTP service. The service gets a customer ID and should return
the coordinates belonging to the customer's address in XML format. Our
company already has a customer database, and it has access to a SOAP
localization service. The target system architecture looks like Figure
1, and it's our task to build the new HTTP service.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8969f1.large.jpg"><img src="8969f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Glue That Binds
</p></div></div><p>
Building it step by step, first we modify the customers database
and build an access layer for it. Then, we implement a binding for
the localization service, and finally, we hide all this behind a nice
HTTP interface. As you might have guessed from the article's title,
we use Ruby to do all of this.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ad580.0x1aa5768"></a>
The Customers Database</h2></div></div><p>
Customers are stored in a MySQL database called customers. It basically
consists of only two tables: customer and address (Listing
1). Every entry in the customer table refers to an entry in the
address table and vice versa. Both tables have a primary key called
id that is generated automatically by the database.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ad580.0x1aa5870"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. create_db.sql</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
drop table if exists customer;
create table customer(
  id int unsigned not null auto_increment,
  forename varchar(64) not null,
  surname varchar(64) not null,
  created_on timestamp not null,
  primary key(id)
);

drop table if exists address;
create table address(
  id int unsigned not null auto_increment,
  customer_id int unsigned not null,
  street varchar(64),
  house_number varchar(16),
  postal_code varchar(16),
  city varchar(64),
  state char(2),
  primary key(id),
  foreign key (customer_id) references customer(id)
    on delete cascade
);
</pre></div><p>
Because we have to store the coordinates of every address, we add a new
table called locations (Listing 2). It contains the longitude and
latitude belonging to every address.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ad580.0x1aa5ad8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>

  latitude double not null,
  primary key(id),
  foreign key (address_id) references address(id)
    on delete cascade
);
</pre></div><p>
Alternatively, we could add longitude and latitude columns to the
address table, but our solution is less invasive. Perhaps there are
applications performing SQL statements such as select * from address,
and we do not want to break them.
</p><p>
That's all we have to do on the database side for the moment. Now, we'll
see how to access the tables in a Ruby program.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ad580.0x1aa5d98"></a>
Accessing the Database</h2></div></div><p>
There are many ways to access relational databases. For example, you
can use the database's native interface or an abstraction layer such as
DBI. But in an object-oriented language like Ruby, an object-relational
mapper (ORM) is by far the most convenient tool. ORMs map rows in a
database table to objects and vice versa without a single SQL statement.
</p><p>
ActiveRecord is the most advanced ORM for Ruby and implements one of
Martin Fowler's enterprise application patterns (see the on-line Resources). He
defines it as follows: &ldquo;[An active record is] an object that wraps a row in a database
table or view, encapsulates the database access and adds domain logic
on that data.&rdquo; Simply put, an active record is a class that provides
the typical CRUD methods (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) for a single
row in a database table.
</p><p>
ActiveRecord is part of the famous Ruby on Rails project, but it's
completely independent of the rest and can be obtained and installed
separately. We'll use it to map our three tables to classes.
</p><p>
If you've worked with an ORM before, you probably expect some boring
configuration files now. How do we map a table to a Ruby class? How do we
map a column to an attribute? Don't be afraid! You don't need all this,
because ActiveRecord prefers convention over configuration. The short
program in Listing 3 is all you need to map the Customer, Address
and Location classes to the according tables.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ad580.0x1aa6000"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 3. database.rb</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

require 'rubygems'
require 'active_record'

class Customer &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  set_table_name 'customer'
  has_one :address
end

class Address &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  set_table_name 'address'
  belongs_to :customer
  has_one :location
end

class Location &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :address
end

ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  :adapter =&gt; 'mysql',
  :database =&gt; 'customers'
)

</pre></div><p>
You do not have to do a lot. Derive every class from ActiveRecord::Base,
and you get accessors for every column for free. These accessors have
the same names as the corresponding columns. For example, the Customer
class has accessors called id, forename, surname and created_on.
</p><p>
ActiveRecord maps a class to a table having the same name in plural form
by default. A class named User is mapped to the users table, and a
class named Location is mapped to the locations table. When you work
with a legacy database, you cannot choose table names yourself. In such
cases, specify the table name with the set_table_name method as we did
for our two legacy tables.
</p><p>
Every table must have a numerical primary key called id that is filled
by the database automatically. You can change the name of the primary
key with the set_primary_key method, but if your legacy tables contain
complicated primary keys spanning several columns, ActiveRecord might
not be the right tool for your job. ActiveRecord really shines when you
adhere to its conventions.
</p><p>
Use belongs_to, has_one, has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many to
declare relationships between the different classes. Naming is important
for specifying relationships too. Note the naming scheme we have used
for the foreign keys. In the address table, for example, the foreign
key is called customer_id. By loose convention, many developers built the
name of a foreign key column by appending _id to the name of the table to
which
the key refers. If you do this too, there's nothing more to be done.
</p><p>
In the last lines of Listing 3, we establish the connection to the
MySQL database. If you need to, you can pass :host, :username and
:password options.
</p><p>
Listing 4 shows how to insert a new customer and address into the
database. It's all very intuitive, and we have to clarify only a few
details. In line 7, we store a customer in the database. The save
method automatically creates a new customer ID. We use this ID in line
10 to associate the address with the customer. ActiveRecord creates
accessors for depending tables automatically&mdash;that is, all instances of the
Customer class have an address attribute that refers to the according
entry in the address table. What could be easier?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ad580.0x1aa6420"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 4. create_customer.rb</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
require 'database'

customer = Customer.new(
  :forename =&gt; 'Homer',
  :surname =&gt; 'Simpson'
)
customer.save

address = Address.new(
  :customer_id =&gt; customer.id,
  :street =&gt; 'Main Street',
  :house_number =&gt; '42',
  :postal_code =&gt; '75244',
  :city =&gt; 'Dallas',
  :state =&gt; 'TX'
)
address.save
</pre></div><p>
We can find our new customer with one of the following statements:

<pre     class="programlisting">
customer = Customer.find(1)
customer = Customer.find_by_forename('Homer')
customer = Customer.find_by_surname('Simpson)
</pre>
</p><p>
ActiveRecord dynamically creates tons of useful find methods. For
example, Address.find(:all) iterates over all entries in the address
table. In addition, you can search for arbitrary combinations of column
values&mdash;that is, there are methods such as
find_by_forename_and_surname.
</p><p>
Gone are the days when you had to fiddle with LEFT OUTER JOIN clauses
and the like. ActiveRecord hides all this nasty stuff, and it even has many
more useful features, such as single table inheritance and validations. It
has been ported to nearly all database systems available today and is
constantly enhanced by a big community.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ad580.0x1aa6790"></a>
Localizing the Customer's Address</h2></div></div><p>
Now we know how to store the coordinates belonging to a customer's
address in the database. The next thing to do is to calculate those
coordinates. Normally, this would be a difficult problem and would
call for a digital map. Luckily, we can delegate this job to a SOAP
localization service.
</p><p>
SOAP is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol standardized by the W3C. It
allows you to create and use objects on a remote host as if they were
part of your local process. Method calls and their parameters are turned
into XML documents and are sent over a network layer. In the receiving
process, they are converted back into method calls again. Return values
and exceptions are represented as XML documents also and are sent back
to the calling process. Although SOAP is independent of the transport
layer, most applications use HTTP or HTTPS.
</p><p>
Fortunately, you normally do not have to know all these nitty-gritty
details to use a SOAP service. It's sufficient to know where you can
find it on a network, what methods it supports and what transport
layer it uses. For this purpose, you'll usually use the Web Service
Description Language (WSDL). The localization services' interface is
described in Listing 5. Even if you're not familiar with WSDL, you should
have no problems finding the definition of the locate function of the
LocalizationService service. It takes an address (street, house number,
postal code, city and state) and returns a two-element array containing
its longitude and latitude.

</pre></div><p>
Ruby has excellent support for SOAP because of the SOAP4R library (see
Resources). It
implements version 1.1 of the SOAP specification and is easy to use. If
you've worked with SOAP before, you probably know what to do with a WSDL
file. Normally, you'd use it to create skeleton code for a SOAP server
or client you're going to implement. SOAP4R comes with a tool called
wsdl2ruby.rb that turns a WSDL file into Ruby code. It can create
code both for accessing a service having the interface described in the file
and for creating a server that implements the interface.
</p><p>
We need a client that uses the localization service, and we could generate
the complete code from the WSDL file with wsdl2ruby.rb. But in a dynamic
language like Ruby, we don't need this intermediate step. It's easier to
derive the client from a WSDL file on the fly. Listing 6 demonstrates
how to do this.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ad580.0x1aa6c08"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 6. loc_service.rb</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
require 'soap/wsdlDriver'

class LocalizationService
  def initialize(wsdl_file)
    factory = WSDLDriverFactory.new(wsdl_file)
    @loc_service = factory.create_rpc_driver
  end

  def locate(address)
    @loc_service.locate(
      address.street,

      address.postal_code,
      address.city,
      address.state
    )
  end
end
</pre></div><p>
The initialize method expects a WSDL file and creates a driver factory
from it. This factory creates a driver (a synonym for proxy) for every
service binding that has been specified in the WSDL file. We choose the
RPC driver and treat the instance variable @loc_service as if it were
a local object of class LocalizationService. In the locate method,
we simply delegate the work to the localization service.
</p><p>
You need to run a standalone SOAP server to make these examples work,
as shown in Listing 7.

Build an HTTP Server</h2></div></div><p>
In a final step, we build an HTTP server that returns the coordinates
belonging to a particular address as an XML document. It takes some time
to calculate the coordinates, and the localization service isn't free
either. Hence, we calculate coordinates only if necessary and store
them locally in our database.
</p><p>
Back in the old days of the Internet, you had to use standards like the
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) to create dynamic Web sites. Whenever a
client requested a nonstatic page, the Web server called an external
program&mdash;often a Perl or bash script&mdash;to create the content. The
server passed it the current environment, including the client's request parameters, and returned the script's output to the requesting
client. This approach causes a severe performance overhead, because the
scripts have to be started as separate processes.
</p><p>
CGI programs have more disadvantages. First, they cannot easily maintain
a state, because they are shut down immediately after they have done
their work. Second, they are often a security problem, because they run
in a more or less uncontrolled environment.
</p><p>
With the advent of Java, an alternative technology became fairly
popular&mdash;servlets. Servlets are little code snippets that are executed by a
so-called servlet container. They are loaded into memory only once
and can be reused as often as necessary. This increases performance
tremendously, and it allows developers to manage state information in the
servlets. Eventually, the servlet container controls the environment of
the servlets and can prevent them from performing unwanted operations
such as deleting files.
</p><p>
Ruby ships with WEBrick (see Resources), a fantastic framework for creating HTTP
servers. It allows you to follow the more or less obsolete CGI approach,
but it strongly encourages the use of Ruby servlets. In Listing 8, you
can see a servlet that implements the main logic of our service.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19ad580.0x1db2100"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 8. servlet.rb</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

require 'rubygems'
require 'builder'
require 'database'
require 'loc_service'

class LocalizationServlet &lt; AbstractServlet
  def initialize(server, wsdl)
    super(server)
    @loc_service = LocalizationService.new(wsdl)
  end

  def do_GET(req, res)
    customer_id = req.query['customer_id']
    customer = Customer.find(customer_id)
    address = customer.address
    if address.location.nil?
      lon, lat = @loc_service.locate(address)
      address.location = Location.new(
        :longitude =&gt; lon, :latitude =&gt; lat
      )
      customer.save
    end
    res['content-type'] = 'text/xml'
    res.body = to_xml(address.location)
    res.status = 200
  end

  def to_xml(location)
    xml = ''
    doc = Builder::XmlMarkup.new(
      :target =&gt; xml, :indent =&gt; 2
    )
    doc.position(
      :longitude =&gt; location.longitude,
      :latitude =&gt; location.latitude
    )
    xml
  end
end

</pre></div><p>
We have derived our servlet from class AbstractServlet. The WEBrick
server calls the do_GET method whenever it receives a GET request
for a certain URL. Accordingly, it calls do_POST, do_PUT and so
on for other HTTP request methods. WEBrick always passes a Request and
a Response object to the method it calls. Request objects contain all
query parameters and headers that were sent by the client. It's your task
to fill the Response object with a body and all headers that should be
sent back.
</p><p>
In our case, the servlet logic reads like a pseudo-code specification. We
try to read the geographical position of the customer having the ID
customer_id from the database. If we cannot find it, we localize
the customer's address using the localization service and store the
coordinates in the database, so we do not have to localize it again. Next,
we turn the coordinates into an XML document. At the end of the method,
we set the content type, the HTTP status code and the body.
</p><p>
You do not have to define an initialize method for a servlet, but if
you do, it always gets the server instance as its first argument. In
our case, we also expect the name of the WSDL to be used to initialize
the localization service.
</p><p>
The to_xml method converts a location into an XML document. Too often,
developers use raw strings to create XML documents. I recommend never
doing that, even for apparently trivial documents. Creating XML documents
never is as easy as it seems, because you have to care about difficult
concepts, such as well-formedness and character set encodings. Hence,
we use Jim Weirich's XmlBuilder class (see Resources) to create the result document.
</p><p>
Now we have a servlet that implements our main logic, but a
servlet alone won't cut it. We still have to create an HTTP server that
controls it. Listing 9 is everything we need. We specify the port on
which the
server is listening and map our LocalizationServlet to the path
/. In addition, we make the server terminate whenever it receives a
SIGINT or SIGTERM signal.

It's time for a final test run. Point your favorite browser to
http://localhost:4242/?customer_id=1 or use a command-line tool such as
wget or curl to test our newly created service:

<pre     class="programlisting">

mschmidt:/tmp $ curl http://localhost:4242/?customer_id=1
&lt;position longitude="97.03" latitude="32.9"/&gt;
mschmidt:/tmp $

</pre>
</p><p>
That's exactly the result we have expected. We're done!

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
There's no doubt, regarding enterprise integration, Ruby is ready for prime
time. Even in this short article, we were able to cover some of the most
important enterprise technologies, such as relational databases, SOAP
and HTTP. You also can integrate your existing Java code, access LDAP
servers, create XML-RPC services or manipulate XML documents with ease.

Ruby cannot compete in many respects with platforms such as J2EE or
.NET, but it doesn't have to, and it doesn't want to. Its strengths are
flexibility, maintainability and speed of development. Although the Ruby
platform might not be the biggest compared to other dynamic languages,
it might well be the one that's growing fastest. And, most important,
it's a lot of fun!
