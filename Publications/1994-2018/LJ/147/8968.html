Ruby on Rails 1.1 and the paradox of how constraints can lead to greater
freedom.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x10192f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Ruby on Rails is a framework for Web application development that
promises&mdash;and delivers&mdash;a powerful, productive and fun platform
for building dynamic Web sites. A framework can be thought of as a
library&mdash;a collection of functions for your application to use&mdash;but it's
also more than that, it's a system of constraints for your code. Why
would constraints be a good thing? Because by embracing constraints for
a specific purpose, you actually enable creativity by focusing energy
on the problem at hand. The Rails framework is a set of constraints
that enable effective Web development. To get a feel for how it works,
let's look at the parts that make up Rails.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x10193f8"></a>
ActiveRecord</h2></div></div><p>
Like most Web application frameworks, Rails follows the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which divides your
code into three logical layers. The model layer consists of domain
objects, backed by a database, and the Rails component for that job is
ActiveRecord. Note the three major features of ActiveRecord: associations,
callbacks and validations. Associations allow you to define relationships
between your ActiveRecord classes, such as one-to-one, one-to-many
and many-to-many. Here's how it looks:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many   :projects
  has_one    :address
  belongs_to :department
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Details that normally would require configuration (table
names, foreign key names and so on) are inferred automatically, and
object attributes are created automatically for every column in the
database. Rails calls this convention over configuration. Callbacks
provide a robust set of hooks into the life cycle of your objects,
where you can add behavior. For example, when user record is saved for
the first time, send a welcome e-mail:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  after_create :send_welcome_email
  after_update :update_audit_log
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Validations are a special kind of callback that make standard
data validation routines a cinch:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of     :name
  validates_format_of       :phone, :with =&gt; /^[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$/i
  validates_confirmation_of :email
  validates_acceptance_of   :terms_of_service, :message =&gt; "must be accepted"
  validates_inclusion_of    :age, :in =&gt; 0..99
end

</pre>
</p><p>
By keeping your associations, callbacks and validations rules in the
ActiveRecord class definition, you make it easier to create
reliable, maintainable code.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x1019710"></a>
ActionController</h2></div></div><p>
ActionPack has two subcomponents that work together closely,
ActionController and ActionView. ActionController classes define
actions&mdash;public methods that are accessible from the Web. Actions always end
in one of two ways: either with a redirect (an HTTP response header sent
back, causing the client to be forwarded to another URL) or with a render
(some content being sent back to the client, usually an HTML file). When
an action does a render, ActionView is invoked. Take a look at an example
controller, with three actions:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class MessagesController &lt; ActionController::Base
  def list
    @messages = Message.find :all
  end

              def show
    @message = Message.find params[:id]
  end

  def create
    @message = Message.create params[:message]
    redirect_to :action =&gt; :show, :id =&gt; @message.id
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
The first action uses an ActiveRecord object to find all messages in
the database and then renders the template messages/list.rhtml. The
second action looks up one particular message by its ID and shows
it. The third action also uses the ActiveRecord object, this time to
save the parameters passed in from an HTML form. Then, it sends an HTTP
redirect response, sending the user back to the show action.
</p><p>
Controllers and actions are mapped to URLs using routes. The default route
is :controller/:action/:id, so without any additional configuration,
the URL for the actions above would be /messages/list, /messages/show/1
and /messages/create.
</p><p>
In addition to actions, controllers also can have filters, which allow
you to interrupt actions, and caches, which allow actions to execute
faster. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class MessagesController &lt; ActionController::Base
  before_filter :authenticate, :except =&gt; :public
  caches_page   :public
  caches_action :show, :feed
end

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x10199d0"></a>
ActionView</h2></div></div><p>
ActionView is Rails' system for formatting the output of your
application&mdash;usually HTML files. The primary mechanism is ERB, Embedded Ruby,
which will be familiar to anyone who has used PHP or JSP-like syntax. Any
template file with an .rhtml extension can have embedded Ruby snippets,
inside of &lt;% %&gt; and &lt;%= %&gt; tags. The first kind doesn't output anything,
the second does. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;% for message in @messages %&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;%= message.title %&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
You also can create template partials to extract commonly used chunks of
markup, and helpers are Ruby functions available within your templates
to provide handy functionality, like drop-dead easy Ajax. Lastly, special
templates called layouts can hold markup that is common to the whole
project (like HTML headers and footers).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x1019b88"></a>
Rails 1.1</h2></div></div><p>
The first public release of Ruby on Rails was version 0.5, in July
2004. More than a year later (and with nearly every line of code changed)
Ruby on Rails 1.0 was announced in December 2005. That milestone was
preceded by an intense push of polishing and testing to ensure that it
was a solid release&mdash;so you might expect that the Rails Core team has
coasted down the tracks since then, enjoying the phenomenal success of
its software.
</p><p>
You might expect that, but you'd be wrong. In fact, they haven't
slowed down one bit, and the next major release of Rails has just been
announced. It's the biggest release to date, with more than 500 enhancements,
fixes and tweaks. The majority of the 500 changes subtly polishes existing
features, but some of them are superstars that promise to change the way
your applications are developed. I've poured through the change logs to
find the most interesting parts, and they can be lumped into three major
groups: powerful Ajax, richer domain models and easy Web services.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x1019ce8"></a>
Powerful Ajax</h2></div></div><p>
Arguably, the most significant new features in Rails 1.1 redefine the way
Rails handles Ajax. Rails already had top-notch support for creating
Ajax applications&mdash;it works by sending small snippets of HTML to a
page to be inserted. Now, it also can return JavaScript to the browser
to be evaluated. That means updating more than one page element in one
step is a snap.
</p><p>
The kicker is that instead of writing the JavaScript by hand,
it can be generated by Rails, using Ruby syntax. That's where RJS,
Ruby-generated JavaScript, comes into play. In addition to .rhtml (Ruby
HTML) templates, you can create .rjs (Ruby JavaScript) ones. In them,
you can write Ruby code that will generate JavaScript code, which is
sent as the result of an Ajax call and evaluated by the browser.
</p><p>
Let's look at an example to see how this can be used. The
on-line store IconBuffet uses RJS for its shopping cart (see
<a href="http://www.iconbuffet.com/products/amsterdam" target="_self">www.iconbuffet.com/products/amsterdam</a> to try it out). When a
product is added to the cart, three separate page elements need to be
updated to reflect the change. Before RJS, that would entail a dozen
lines of JavaScript and multiple round-trips to the server. But now,
it can be accomplished in one pass, with no custom JavaScript.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8968f1.large.jpg"><img src="8968f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Add an Item to the Cart
</p></div></div><p>
The Add to Cart button uses the standard Ajax link helper, just
like before:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;%= link_to_remote "Add to Cart", :url =&gt; { :action =&gt;
 "add_to_cart", :id =&gt; 1 } %&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Clicking the link triggers the add_to_cart action, which updates the
session and renders its template, add_to_cart.rjs:

<pre     class="programlisting">

page[:cartbox].replace_html :partial =&gt; 'cart'
page[:num_items].replace_html :partial =&gt; 'num_items'
page["product_#{params[:id]}"].addClassName 'incart'

</pre>
</p><p>
The template is rendered into JavaScript that is sent back to
the browser and evaluated, which updates the three page elements
accordingly. You may be wondering where this page object came
from&mdash;it's passed to RJS templates to represent JavaScriptGenerator, and it
has many tricks up its sleeve:
</p><p>
1) Pop a JavaScript dialog box:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.alert 'Howdy'
</pre>
</p><p>
2) Replace the outerHTML of an element:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.replace :element, "value"
</pre>
</p><p>
3) Replace the contents of an element:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.replace_html :element, "value"
</pre>
</p><p>
4) Insert text:

<pre     class="programlisting">

page.insert_html :bottom, :list, '&lt;li&gt;Last item&lt;/li&gt;'

</pre>
</p><p>
5) Simulate a redirect with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
window.location.href: page.redirect_to url_for(...)
</pre>
</p><p>
6) Call a JavaScript function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.call :alert, "Hello"
</pre>
</p><p>
7) Assign to a JavaScript variable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.assign :variable, "value"
</pre>
</p><p>
8) Call an effect:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.visual_effect :highlight, 'list'
page.visual_effect :toggle, "posts"
page.visual_effect :toggle, 'comment', :effect =&gt; :blind
</pre>
</p><p>
9) Show an element:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.show 'status-indicator'
</pre>
</p><p>
10) Hide elements:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.hide 'status-indicator', 'cancel-link'
</pre>
</p><p>
11) Refer to an element by ID:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page['blank_slate']
page['blank_slate'].show
</pre>
</p><p>
12) Get elements with CSS selectors:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.select('p')
page.select('p.welcome b').first
page.select('p.welcome b').first.hide
</pre>
</p><p>
13) Insert some JavaScript:

<pre     class="programlisting">

page &lt;&lt; "alert('hello')"

</pre>
</p><p>
14) Make a draggable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.draggable 'product-1'
</pre>
</p><p>
15) Make a droppable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.drop_receiving 'wastebasket', :url =&gt; { :action =&gt; 'delete' }
</pre>
</p><p>
16) Make a sortable:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.sortable 'todolist', :url =&gt; { action =&gt; 'change_order' }
</pre>
</p><p>
17) Delay execution:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.delay(20) { page.visual_effect :fade, 'notice' }
</pre>
</p><p>
Enumerable methods also can be used, and they'll generate the equivalent
JavaScript code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
page.select('#items li').collect('items') do |element|
              element.hide
      end
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x1011758"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which generates this JavaScript:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var items = $$('#items li').collect(function(value, index)
 &#8618;{ return value.hide(); });
</pre>
</p><p>
In addition to having .rjs files in your views directory, you also
can write inline RJS. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

def create
  # (handle action)
  render :update do |page|
	  page.insert_html :bottom, :list, '&lt;li&gt;Last item&lt;/li&gt;'
	  page.visual_effect :highlight, 'list'
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, you don't want to pollute your controllers with a lot of
view-specific code, so you also can write RJS Helpers that can be called
from update blocks. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

module ApplicationHelper
  def update_time
    page.replace_html 'time', Time.now.to_s(:db)
    page.visual_effect :highlight, 'time'
  end
end

class UserController &lt; ApplicationController
  def poll
    render :update { |page| page.update_time }
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Debugging RJS can be tricky, because if a Ruby exception occurs,
no error will be visible in the browser. To get around that, set
<tt  >config.action_view.debug_rjs = true</tt>, and you'll be notified of RJS
exceptions via alert().
</p><p>
You may have noticed that the output of the RJS templates makes use
of a great new feature of Prototype: methods of the Element class are
mixed into all HTML elements that are referenced by $() and $$(). That
means instead of writing <tt  >Element.show('foo')</tt>, you now can write
<tt  >$('foo').show()</tt>. It's a small change that makes writing JavaScript
code more natural and Ruby-like. The methods available are visible(),
toggle(), hide(), show(), visualEffect(), remove(), update(html),
replace(html), getHeight(), classNames(), hasClassName(className),
addClassName(className), removeClassName(className), cleanWhitespace(),
empty(), childOf(ancestor), scrollTo(), getStyle(style), setStyle(style),
getDimensions(), makePositioned(), undoPositioned(), makeClipping() and
undoClipping().
</p><p>
Ruby-generated JavaScript also uses another fantastic new feature of
Prototype, the Selector class and its corresponding $$() function. Like
the $() function, $$() is used to reference HTML elements, but this one
matches elements by CSS selector strings. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

// Find all &lt;img&gt; elements inside &lt;p&gt; elements with class
// "summary", all inside the &lt;div&gt; with id "page". Hide
// each matched &lt;img&gt; tag.
$$('div#page p.summary img').each(Element.hide)

// Attributes can be used in selectors as well:
$$('form#foo input[type=text]').each(function(input) {
  input.setStyle({color: 'red'});
});

</pre>
</p><p>
If you're not convinced by now, take it from me, RJS and the new additions
to Prototype will revolutionize the way Ajax is done in Rails.

Rich Domain Models in ActiveRecord</h2></div></div><p>
So far, we've looked at advancements in the controller and view layers
of Rails. Let's turn now to ActiveRecord, which also got a lot of love
in this release. First up, a new type of association.
</p><p>
Prior to 1.1, Rails supported many-to-many relationships with has_and_belongs_to_many. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Author &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :books
end
class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :authors
end

</pre>
</p><p>
That works fine, to a point. The difficulty comes in when you need data or
behavior for the association itself. The solution is to make an explicit
join model for the association. Take a look at this alternative:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Author &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :authorships
  has_many :books, :through =&gt; :authorships
end
class Authorship &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :author
  belongs_to :book
end
class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :authorships
  has_many :authors, :through =&gt; :authorships
end
Author.find(:first).books.find(:all, :include =&gt; :reviews)

</pre>
</p><p>
The new :through option of has_many allows you to specify an
explicit association join model, so you can have the ease of
has_and_belongs_to_many but get full power of ActiveRecord for the
Authorship model.
</p><p>
The :through option also can be used where the intermediate association
is a has_many. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Firm &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :clients
  has_many :invoices, :through =&gt; :clients
end
class Client &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :firm
  has_many   :invoices
end
class Invoice &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :client
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Without the :through option, getting all invoices for a firm would
require multiple SQL hits to the database or a custom SQL query. Now,
ActiveRecord handles the join automatically and leaves a clean API to
access the associations.
</p><p>
Another new association option that further enriches your domain
models is polymorphic associations. This solves the problem of having a
model that could share relationships with multiple other models. With
polymorphic associations, the model defines an abstract association,
which can represent any other model, and ActiveRecord keeps track of
the details. Take a look at this example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class Address &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :addressable, :polymorphic =&gt; true
end
class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :address, :as =&gt; :addressable
end
class Company &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :address, :as =&gt; :addressable
end

</pre>
</p><p>
Any developer experienced with SQL has run into the &ldquo;n+1 queries&rdquo;
problem, where looking up a set of records, each with a related record,
causes a large number of queries to the database. The solution is SQL JOIN
statements, but writing them by hand quickly gets complicated, especially
after more than one join. Rails 1.1 significantly reduces that pain, with
cascading, bottomless eager loading. Now, queries like <tt  >Author.find(:all,
:include=&gt; { :posts =&gt; :comments })</tt> will fetch all authors, their posts
and the comments belonging to those posts in a single query. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Author.find :all, :include =&gt; { :posts =&gt; :comments }
Author.find :all, :include =&gt; [ { :posts =&gt; :comments }, :categorizations ]
Author.find :all, :include =&gt; { :posts =&gt; [ :comments, :categorizations ] }
Company.find :all, :include =&gt; { :groups =&gt; { :members =&gt; :favorites } }
</pre>
</p><p>
The next major new feature of ActiveRecord is nested with_scope. This
feature allows your dealings with ActiveRecord objects to be more
clearly understood&mdash;especially important for code with security
implications. Here's an example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Developer.with_scope :find =&gt; { :conditions =&gt; "salary &gt; 10000", :limit =&gt; 10 } do

  # SELECT * FROM developers WHERE (salary &gt; 10000) LIMIT 10:
  Developer.find :all

  # parameters are merged
  Developer.with_scope :find =&gt; { :conditions =&gt; "name = 'Jamis'" } do
    # SELECT * FROM developers WHERE (( salary &gt; 10000 ) AND ( name = 'Jamis' )) LIMIT 10
    Developer.find :all
  end

  # inner rule is used. (all previous parameters are ignored)
  Developer.with_exclusive_scope :find =&gt; { :conditions =&gt; "name = 'Jamis'" } do
    # SELECT * FROM developers WHERE (name = 'Jamis'):
    Developer.find :all
  end

end

</pre>
</p><p>
The last major addition to ActiveRecord provides convenient syntax for
accessing calculations and statistics, without writing custom SQL. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Person.count
Person.count   :conditions =&gt; "age &gt; 26"
Person.count   :include =&gt; :job, :conditions =&gt; "age &gt; 26 AND job.salary &gt; 60000"
Person.average :age
Person.maximum :age
Person.minimum :age, :having =&gt; "min(age) &gt; 17", :group =&gt; :last_name
Person.sum     :salary, :group =&gt; :last_name
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf21580.0x1012410"></a>
Easy Web Services</h2></div></div><p>
The third big category of changes in Rails 1.1 involves creating Web
services&mdash;specifically, embracing certain aspects of the HTTP protocol
so that REST-style APIs can be implemented very easily.
</p><p>
The first piece of the equation is a new method for your actions,
respond_to. This method parses the HTTP Accept header sent from the
client, so that one action can return multiple response formats. For
example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class MessagesController &lt; ActionController::Base
  def list
    @messages = Message.find :all
      respond_to do |type|
                              type.html # using defaults, which will render messages/list.rhtml
                              type.xml  { render :xml =&gt; @messages.to_xml } # generates XML and sends it with the right MIME type
                              type.js   # renders index.rjs
    end
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, a typical browser requesting /messages/list will get
the HTML version of the data back, as usual. But an Ajax request for
the same URL might send an Accept header of
application/javascript&mdash;triggering the RJS template to be used instead. Yet another client
might want to interact with your application as a Web service API, so
it requests application/xml, and the same action handles that format
as well. If you've wondered how hard it would be to add an API to your
Web application, it's never been easier.
</p><p>
The above example includes a new option for the render method, :xml. It
works just like render(:text =&gt; text), but sets the content-type to
application/xml and the charset to UTF-8. You can specify the
content-type header manually with the :content_type option. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
render :action =&gt; "atom.rxml", :content_type =&gt; "application/atom+xml"
</pre>
</p><p>
Arrays, hashes and ActiveRecord now have a to_xml method, and every
object has to_json. These powerful additions mean that providing
machine-readable versions of your application data can be accomplished
with a few keystrokes. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">

message.to_xml
message.to_xml(:skip_instruct =&gt; true, :skip_attributes =&gt; [ :id, bonus_time, :written_on, replies_count ])
firm.to_xml :include =&gt; [ :account, :clients ]

[1,2,3].to_json =&gt; "[1, 2, 3]"
"Hello".to_json =&gt; "\"Hello\""
Person.find(:first).to_json =&gt; "{\"attributes\": {\"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Scott Raymond\"}}"

</pre>

The above examples demonstrate how easily you can enable a read-only
API, but what if you want to accept input from the API as well? Well,
it's remarkably simple:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class MessagesController &lt; ActionController::Base
  def create
    @message = Message.create params[:message]
    redirect_to :action =&gt; :show, :id =&gt; @message.id
  end
end

</pre>
</p><p>
But wait&mdash;isn't that the same code as the non-API version of the
action? Indeed, Rails now examines the HTTP content-type header of the
incoming POST and parses the input accordingly into the params
object&mdash;just as if the data came from a Web form. By default, requests submitted
with the application/xml content type are handled by creating an XmlSimple
hash with the same name as the root element of the submitted XML. XML
data is handled automatically, but what if you want to handle other
formats as well? Enter pluggable parameter parsers:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ActionController::Base.param_parsers['application/atom+xml'] = Proc.new do |data|
  node = REXML::Document.new data
  { node.root.name =&gt; node.root }
end
</pre>

Clearly we've barely scratched the surface of the new features in Rails
1.1&mdash;to say nothing of Rails as a whole. But you should now have a
taste of Rails' latest additions. For more in-depth information and
