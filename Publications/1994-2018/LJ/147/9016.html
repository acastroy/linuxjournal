Freespire is Linspire's new inspired response to the factors that are
holding back the best desktop distribution around.

This column has a new name, /var/opinion. I changed it for three
reasons. First, as much as I enjoy a good rant (and I will continue
to rant whenever the mood strikes), I've found too much to rave about
lately. I find it constraining to produce a rant when I get excited
about something good. Second, I named it
/var/<span   class="emphasis"><em>opinion</em></span> because
a column is, by definition, an opinion. We editors and writers take
that for granted, but not all readers are as savvy about publishing
practices. Some readers express dissatisfaction when someone expresses
an opinion in a column. I'm not finding fault with these readers for
doing so, because they simply may not know better. The title is meant
to remind them that an editorial column is opinion. The two are inseparable.
Finally, as many readers were so kind to point out, /etc/rant was not
LSB-compliant. So I changed the location of the column to /var.
</p><p>
Linspire recently announced that it will ship a community-driven
distribution called Freespire sometime in August 2006. When it gets here,
I'll decide if it's worthy of a rant or a rave. But the idea is spot on,
and worthy of a rave.
</p><p>
Let's get the self-serving nature of this move out of the way.
Linspire may grab a lot of pieces from Debian and other sources in order
to produce the Linspire distribution, but the company still has to do a
lot of work fine-tuning the distribution to make it easier to use than
the competition. Linspire is attempting to
off-load that work to the volunteer community. It sounds like Linspire
is exploiting volunteers, but if so, Linspire is just joining a very big
club. Red Hat created Fedora Core 5 in part to off-load the development
of the core distribution to volunteers. Countless Debian-based
distributions exploit the hard work of Debian volunteers. So, unless
you want to spread the blame across just about every distribution
available, Linspire doesn't deserve any criticism for doing the same.
</p><p>
Let me squash another probable criticism. Is Freespire Linspire's
response to the threat of an Ubuntu/Kubuntu revolution? Probably. But
again, what difference does that make if we Linux users benefit?
</p><p>
Here's the cool thing about Freespire. The Linspire folks are
adopting some of the most significant improvements you'll find in other
distributions, such as Ubuntu. For example, you will be forced to create
a user account and will no longer log in as root by default.
</p><p>
More important, the plan is to make it customizable. Those who are
anal about licensing issues can have a completely open-source version of
Freespire. Those who want to use Java, Flash, play DVDs or do anything
else that requires an alternative license or proprietary software can
get Freespire with support for these additions.
</p><p>
Maybe you're a license freak, in which case you don't use Java,
Flash or play DVDs on Linux. Sorry, but I'm not only unafraid of most
licenses (some are unacceptable, but not most), I actually use and
pay for proprietary software. For example, there's a new proprietary
graphics program out there called Pixel, and it looks fantastic. It's
almost like an incredibly inexpensive Photoshop clone. It is far more
intuitive and friendly than GIMP. So, to me, it's worth every penny. Visit
<a href="http://www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel" target="_self">www.kanzelsberger.com/pixel</a> for more information, and don't be
a cheapskate if you like what you see.
</p><p>
I also want Flash support for my browser, I want to play DVDs, and I
can't live without Java. Aside from applications like Jedit and Eclipse,
my favorite Java applet is the doppler radar applet you can find on the
National Weather Service site (NOAA). Just visit <a href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov" target="_self">www.srh.noaa.gov</a>
and select your location, click on the radar map and then select one of
the radar types (composite reflectivity or base reflectivity, among others).
I went tornado chasing while I lived in Missouri, and I found this feature
to be invaluable. By the way, I'm told NOAA has adopted Linux as its
standard platform.
</p><p>
Back to Freespire. If Freespire attracts a community of developers,
it could easily turn out to be my distribution of choice. Why? I think
Linspire is by far the best desktop distribution available. Linspire
blows away every other distribution in terms of ease of use.
</p><p>
In spite of all this praise, I don't use Linspire on a daily basis. One
reason I don't use it is because Linspire takes so long to stay up to
date with KDE and hardware support. It always has an older version of KDE,
and it doesn't even install on my latest dual-core AMD64 machine.
</p><p>
Just as the Fedora developers have been able to keep Fedora more
up to date than Red Hat was able to do internally, perhaps the Freespire
developers will be able to keep Linspire current, and therefore more
attractive to people like me. And, maybe even you. Keep an eye on
Freespire. I will.
