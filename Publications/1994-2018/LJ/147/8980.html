<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #147, July 2006</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<span   class="bold"><b>Paul Mundt</b></span> has submitted patches to
remove <span   class="bold"><b>RelayFS</b></span> from the kernel and
migrate all of its functionality into a generic API that can be used by any
filesystem. Thus, what started off as a highly specialized tool&mdash;a
filesystem only for high-speed data transfer between user space and the
kernel&mdash;has now been generalized into a service with wide-ranging
applicability. Because RelayFS has been in the official kernel for some time,
taking it out now already has produced some controversy. But, apparently,
<span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> promised the RelayFS developers that they could continue to
make these large, sweeping developments, so long as no in-kernel code relied
on RelayFS. User applications should not have been relying on RelayFS during
this time of instability.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span> has announced a new open-source
project to support its <span   class="bold"><b>PRO/Wireless
3945ABG Network Connection mini-PCI express adapter</b></span> (IPW3945). It is not
fully open source. There is a single binary-only part, containing the
regulatory enforcement logic for all the countries where those adapters
ship. In his announcement, <span   class="bold"><b>James
Ketrenos</b></span> said that Intel had improved its
licensing relative to earlier projects. The binary portion of this project
uses the same license as the binary-only firmware, and James has said it is
easier to understand and more permissive of redistribution than earlier
licenses. The whole issue of regulatory enforcement and binary distribution
is, as one might expect, controversial. The binary d&aelig;mon must run as root,
which makes any potential bugs a large security problem. Also, there is some
question as to whether the FCC regulations actually require binary-only
distribution, or only, as <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> puts
it, &ldquo;that the transmitting device
must be reasonably tamper-proof&rdquo;. Regardless of any controversy (that is sure
to be ongoing), Intel can at least be credited with freeing the portions of
its code it has freed and with making some effort to improve its
license.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bernhard Rosenkraenzer</b></span> has forked the
<span   class="bold"><b>cdrtools project</b></span> into his own
<span   class="bold"><b>dvdrecord project</b></span>, and released version 0.3.1 with various enhancements,
such as supporting 2.6 kernels, supporting writing to DVD-R and DVD-RW disks
using purely free software and cleaning up the make system. Apparently,
there have been massive flame wars precipitating the fork, and a number of
kernel folks have said that Bernhard's work represents the only progress on
the driver in recent days. The conversation has turned toward whether
his dvdrecord will support additional features, such as DVD RAM, DVD+R, DVD+RWand DVD+DL. It's unclear what the long-term direction of the project will
be, because forks are always controversial, but at least there seems to be
no immediate outcry that Bernhard forked the project unreasonably. It's
still too soon for predictions, however.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Miklos Szeredi</b></span> has created the <span   class="bold"><b>mountlo utility</b></span>, a tool that supports
loopback mounting in user space. Until now, a filesystem image stored in a
single file on disk could be mounted only via the kernel's own loopback
support. Miklos' utility relies on FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace) to move
the entire feature into userland and out of the kernel. Miklos considers it
more of a pet project than anything else&mdash;an opportunity to play with FUSE
and see what useful tools he could create.
</p><p>
The ever-vigilant <span   class="bold"><b>Christoph Hellwig</b></span> has
pointed out that the <span   class="bold"><b>gdth driver</b></span>
seems to be the only user of the <span   class="bold"><b>scsi_request interface</b></span> expected to be gone
in Linux 2.6.17. The gdth maintainers have not responded to patch
submissions, and unless someone steps forward to make sure gdth survives the
interface change, it will be marked as &ldquo;BROKEN&rdquo; in 2.6.17.
<span   class="bold"><b>Achim Leubner</b></span> has
stepped forward to do some testing, but this leaves the question of
driver maintainership up in the air. Typically, unmaintained code is rapidly
deprecated in Linux.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> has begun to document
<span   class="bold"><b>ABI</b></span> (Application Binary Interface)
levels of stability within the kernel. When a binary interface changes,
user-space binaries that link to that interface break. And, because a given
interface may have countless applications relying on it, it is considered
virtually unacceptable to change the kernel ABI for that reason.
Unfortunately, ABI changes are a fact of life. They do change, and have been
changing, and the question as Greg sees it, is how to balance this with the
needs of userland. Greg's idea is to provide enough indication about the
future of a given interface that application developers will have time to
rewrite their code before the change takes place. As one might expect, this
is an incredibly controversial issue. Many top kernel people feel that the
ABI is sacrosanct and should never be altered. But <span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>, in spite
of having criticisms of the specific details of Greg's effort, seems
generally to agree that ABI changes are inevitable, and that the kernel
should do what it can to ease the burden placed on application developers.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>&ldquo;First they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you,
then you win.&rdquo;&mdash;Mahatma Gandhi</em></span>
</p><p>
For many years, Linux and open source were synonymous with
&ldquo;threat&rdquo; at
Microsoft. Although that status may not have changed, the company has
been moving gradually in a more accepting direction toward market
opponents that include, in some cases, its own customers.
</p><p>
We've seen acceptance, for example, in the Identity Metasystem, which was a
topic of my <i  >Linux Journal</i> column in October 2005, and also with the
company's embrace of blogging&mdash;a product of open standards and
practices that grew up outside Microsoft's (or any vendor's) platform.
</p><p>
But with Microsoft's Open Source Software Lab, which started up in
August 2005, acceptance was elevated above the purely de facto level. It
became policy. Then, in April 2006, Microsoft opened the lab
itself, through a new Web site called Port 25. Named for the router port
for outbound e-mail, the site is open, interactive and intended to
foster helpful communications with Microsoft customers that use open-source software as well.
</p><p>
Although this hardly means Microsoft will be developing open-source
software any time soon (especially for Linux), it may help ease tensions
in the heterogeneous environments where customers require productivity,
and not merely coexistence.
</p><p>
I asked David Sifry, founder and CEO of Technorati (which runs on
Linux), for some perspective on what it means. He said, &ldquo;It's good to
see Microsoft recognizing the impact and importance of open-source
software, and I'm encouraged by its recent moves to understand and
work with the large community of nonproprietary software developers out
in the world. In the end, it will be good for Microsoft
customers.&rdquo;

If you're looking to make something more of your digital photos than the
usual on-line gallery, Tabblo has ways to do it. In addition to your
basic GIMP (or, to the less free, Photoshop) tools (crop, zoom, add
text and so on), Tabblo lets you lay out, annotate and share
&ldquo;tabblos&rdquo; (a
pun off &ldquo;tableaus&rdquo;) of photo sets, or output them in various print
forms through off-line services&mdash;all from inside a browser.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8980tabblof1.large.jpg"><img src="8980tabblof1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Tabblo Creator Antonio Rodriguez and Python Creator Guido van Rossum
</p></div></div><p>
As Tabblo founder and CEO Antonio Rodriguez puts it, &ldquo;If you have a
story to tell with pictures, we have ways for you to tell it&mdash;on-line
and off.&rdquo; He also says Tabblo's own story would not be possible without
Linux. To get that story, we did a brief interview:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: Why this business, and why now?</em></span>
</p><p>
AR: This is something the market has needed for a long time, but the
conditions weren't right. The Web browser wasn't built to do serious
multimedia processing, and until recently, it wasn't possible to do
it on the server&mdash;at least not with economics that worked for
anyone trying to build a business out of it. If you wanted to do
server-side image editing at high scale, for example, the cost of
the software and hardware involved was simply prohibitive. If you
wanted to have a rich database of things like metadata-based
navigation and unlimited undo, the cost of the Oracle licenses at
volume would probably put you flat out of the business of providing
any meaningful functionality for free in order to attract customers.
And most important, if you wanted to store gigs and gigs of
people's pictures, NetApp or EMC were the only games in town&mdash;at
economics that make sense only for investment banks and NASA. I can
say without any doubt that there was absolutely <span   class="emphasis"><em>no
way</em></span> that we could
provide the level of application given to users at launch for
free without the benefit of our modified LAMP stack and its
associated development practices. I am particularly sensitive to
this because of the number of photo sites in the past that have actually
tried to make money and have been undone by spiraling capital expenses
and wrong assumptions about the likely uptake of revenue-generating
products.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: What's in your stack?</em></span>
</p><p>
AR: For hardware, we use custom-made whitebox AMD64 boxes with plenty
of horsepower per dollar of cost, running Debian AMD64 (which
greatly lowers our sysadmin costs). We run our own clustered filesystem built mostly on top of the Apache 2.0 stack (as modules) and
get throughput that commercial storage solutions can't touch, mostly
because the software is written specifically for our workload. The
image servers also leverage the Apache runtime, as well as
ImageMagick. Our database is MySQL5, which is great for its ability
to be set up in very funky configurations that let you optimize
writes, reads or replication depending on your own needs. And, finally,
our Web app is written in Python, which is both lightning
fast to develop in and incredibly clean as a dynamically typed language.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: How do you plan to evolve the service?</em></span>
</p><p>
AR: To start, we're going for composition, layout and effects. Next
is printing and distribution. We also plan to make everything
publishable to blogs though the metaweblog API.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Tabblo also makes the most of what's &ldquo;mashable&rdquo; from other Web services,
over open APIs. When Antonio showed me Tabblo's beta service at
O'Reilly's eTech Conference in February 2006, he populated my own Tabblo
library by copying more than 6,000 photos from my collection at
Flickr. He did this also to demonstrate the well-behaved nature of
Flickr as a Net citizen. Rather than locking up customer data, Flickr is
wide open, allowing users on other services to access and use photos,
including all kinds of photo metadata, as well as tags. Tabblo, he told
me, also aims to be equally responsible to what he calls &ldquo;the open
marketplace&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Thus, what's open about Linux-based infrastructure expands out to support
whole marketplaces.

<h2 class="title">They Said It</h2>
<div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

Don't worry about people stealing an idea. If it's original, you will
have to ram it down their throats.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>

<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/03/entrepreneurial_proverbs.html" target="_self">radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/03/entrepreneurial_proverbs.html</a>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One of my many mottos of the past is &ldquo;Only steal from the
best.&rdquo; When
you use someone else's idea that's the ultimate sign of respect. But
it's important to say who you're stealing from, because they're the
best, right?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
&mdash;Dave Winer, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/03/31.html#When:7:12:08AM" target="_self">www.scripting.com/2006/03/31.html#When:7:12:08AM</a>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Think about it this way: if the water that's piped into your house had
DRM on it and only allowed you to use it for showers, how would you wash
your clothes? If you were only allowed to make ice cubes, how would you
make iced tea? If you had to pay $0.99 every time you wanted a glass of
water?
</p><p>
Ideas and hope need to flow like water if a civilization is to continue
its ascension toward greatness. Impediments to that flow will stall
growth. Fortunately, like a solvent, the culture of open source will
continue to expand, will wear away at these impediments, to restore the
natural flow of social capital, of ideas, of hope. Those who get this
first will rise, and rise quickly.
