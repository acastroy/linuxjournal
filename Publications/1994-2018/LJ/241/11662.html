Moxa's DS-P510A-8PoE Series Switches</h2></div></div><p>
Keeping critical devices running in the harshest of environments&mdash;and
thereby protecting the bottom line&mdash;is the role of the Moxa's new
EDS-P510A-8PoE Series rugged switches. Targeted at industrial manufacturing and
outdoor networks, these Gigabit managed PoE+ Ethernet switches are equipped
with eight /100BaseT(X), 802.3af (PoE) and 802.3at (PoE+)-compliant Ethernet
ports, and two combo Gigabit Ethernet ports for uplinks for transmitting data up
to 120km with high EMI immunity. The devices also feature 3KV LAN surge
protection and a wide temperature range (&ndash;40&deg;C to +75&deg;C) that ensures the
highest reliability of PoE systems while delivering network speeds of up to
1,000Mbps to eliminate bottlenecks. PoE-compliant network devices receive a
maximum 30 watts of power per PoE+ port in standard mode, and high power output
of up to 36 watts for greater compatibility with power-hungry devices.

Avago Technologies' 100G QSFP28 SR4 and 100G CFP4 LR4 Optical
Transceivers</h2></div></div><p>
The latest expansion to Avago Technologies' portfolio of 100G optical
transceiver module solutions are the Avago 100G QSFP28 SR4 and 100G CFP4 LR4.
The two innovations, designed for modern data-center and enterprise networking
applications, cover the full spectrum of link distance requirements for 100G
interconnects, says Avago. The 100G QSFP28 SR4 solution, designed for 100GbE
short-range data-center interconnects, is compliant with IEEE 802.3bm
100GBASE-SR4 and CAUI-4 specifications and enables seamless transition from 40G
to 100G using the QSFP form factor. Meanwhile, the 100G CFP4 LR4, designed for
100GbE long-range data communications, is compliant with IEEE 802.3 Clause 88
for 100GBASE-LR4 media, Clause 83E for CAUI-4 electrical interface, OTN OTU4
and the CFP4 MSA for MDIO functionality. The solution leverages best-in-class
CyOptics single-mode laser technology.

2ndQuadrant's Barman</h2></div></div><p>
Professional PostgreSQL specialist 2ndQuadrant is calling the updated Barman
1.3 PostgreSQL Backup and Recovery Manager &ldquo;more robust&rdquo; and
&ldquo;exciting&rdquo;. Barman, an open-source administration tool, allows
businesses of any size to perform continuous remote backups of multiple
servers, providing significant time and cost savings in the event of a crash. A
key feature is the network compression option, which allows for a reduction in
the amount of traffic between the PostgreSQL server and the backup server. For
instance, when two servers are in different data centers, variable costs from
network traffic can be reduced. Barman 1.3 features a new code infrastructure
in terms of output, sub-processes, remote commands, filesystem, events
(&ldquo;hooks&rdquo;) and metadata management. In addition, administrators can now force a
rebuild of the xlog.db file (WAL archive).

Krita</h2></div></div><p>
Although Krita is free, a graphic artist recently described the open-source
digital painting studio as &ldquo;a production beast&rdquo;. Recently updated to
version 2.8, Krita is an advanced digital painting application, used by
illustrators, comic-book artists, concept artists, matte painters and in VFX and
game studios worldwide. Although version 2.8 offers significant advancements on
both Linux and Windows, the release marks a major milestone on the Windows
side: the platform is henceforth fully supported. Of the many new features and
improvements, highlights include a drastically improved drawing experience
thanks to a complete rewrite of the graphics tablet support and an improved
OpenGL canvas. The new High Quality Filtering option uses shaders instead of
hardware to perform display zooming, giving clean, clear, crisp and accurate
line art, also at lower zoom levels. Krita is developed by the Krita team and KO
GmbH.

Terascala's Intelligent Storage Bridge</h2></div></div><p>
The problem that Terascala's Intelligent Storage Bridge (ISB) tackles is
the vast amounts of unstructured &ldquo;stranded data&rdquo; found in
today's
HPC infrastructures. These infrastructures are typically not optimized for
efficient and daily movement of data, which strictly limits valuable analysis
opportunities. Terascala says that ISB is the first solution of its kind to
solve this &ldquo;stranded data&rdquo; challenge by automating the transfer of
large data sets between high-performance fast scratch storage and a
cost-effective enterprise storage system. The latest version of the ISB now
includes vendor-agnostic support of Lustre solutions, allowing organizations to
bring together a wider range of HPC and enterprise storage solutions. Other new
aspects of the ISB include programming interfaces that enable integration and
management by third-party orchestration solutions or home-grown scripts and
applications, as well as passive CIFS and NFS gateway capabilities, which allow
users of workstation technologies lacking Lustre support to access and update
fast scratch data through native filesystem technologies.

Open-E Data Storage Software</h2></div></div><p>
Open-E hews to the philosophy that you should be saving big money by leveraging
commodity servers for centralized data storage in high availability, big data,
cloud storage, virtualization and business continuity environments. This
philosophy is alive and well in the updated Open-E Data Storage Software (DSS)
V7, a Linux-based enterprise storage application used for building and managing
centralized data storage servers&mdash;NAS and SAN. Open-E claims that the Open-E
DSS V7 can significantly increase the performance of replicated environments,
ensuring the safety of customers' businesses in case of any disaster, and brings
superior performance, extensibility and reliability. The company adds that
customers can achieve superior performance of up to 10X in random writes of
mirrored volumes, allowing data to be copied in real time and every change
immediately mirrored from the primary server to the secondary storage server.
Storage system performance also will be evident in environments with multicore
processors and can be optimized further with integrated and improved hardware
performance-tuning parameters.
