Build your own ATmega328p programmer with the BeagleBone Black. This
tutorial starts from raw components and shows you how to assemble the
hardware, manipulate the kernel's device tree files and write the
software for a complete soup-to-nuts project.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1695580.0x178d250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The Raspberry Pi is the inexpensive, embedded Linux computer that
comes to mind for most <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers. Last year, the Pi swept
three Readers' Choice Awards: Linux Product of the Year, Best Other
Linux-Based Gadget and Best New Open-Source Project. However, I was
in the proud 3.3% of readers who voted for the BeagleBone. Although the
Pi may have the popularity, the BeagleBone Black (BBB) has a faster
processor, 2GB of onboard eMMC storage and more than 65 different Input/Output
(I/O) pins. These features make the BBB my embedded development
platform of choice. However, for some truly low-level projects, it is
more appropriate to use an embedded microprocessor, such as that provided
by the familiar Arduino platform.
</p><p>
In this project, I describe how to combine the ATmega328p, the
microprocessor on the Arduino UNO, with the BBB. Specifically, I
detail the steps needed to use the BBB as a programmer for the ATmega328p
so that you can upload sketches built with the Arduino IDE directly to
the chip!
</p><p>
There are a few open-hardware projects that incorporate this
technique. For example, one of the most successful BBB projects,
OpenROV, uses a similar configuration. OpenROV is an open-source
(software and hardware) underwater exploration robot. On the robot,
the ATmega328p controls the servos for movement. There is another
BBB cape that uses an ATmega328p: the CryptoCape. The CryptoCape is a
collaborative project between SparkFun Electronics and Cryptotronix,
my open-hardware company. The cape also contains various other security
Integrated Circuits (ICs), like a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), an
encrypted Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM),
a Real-Time Clock with an attached holder for a coin-cell battery and ICs
that perform the Elliptic Curve Digital Signal Algorithm (ECDSA). I've
included an ATmega328p on the CryptoCape for users to upload their own
crypto-library to the microcontroller or to use the microcontroller to
interface with other hardware.
</p><p>
The soon-to-be-released Arduino TRE combines the Atmel ATmega32u4 with the
Texas Instrument Sitara ARM Cortex-A8. The Arduino TRE is a collaborative
effort between BeagleBoard.org and Arduino, and early looks indicate that
it has four USB ports, HDMI, audio In/Out, Ethernet and power options for
a 5V jack and USB power. Until the TRE is available, you can make your
own BBB and ATmega cross-breed using the approach outlined here.
</p><p>
In this configuration, think of the BBB as a front end for the
ATmega328p. Imagine a configuration where the ATmega328p is controlling
an electromechanical device, but the firmware needs to be updated. With
an attached BBB, the BBB can run a Web server, accept the new firmware
and update the ATmega328p without a programming cable.
</p><p>
For completeness, there is another option for those looking for
a low-level hardware interface on the BBB. The BBB contains two
independent Programmable Real-Time Units (PRUs). The two PRUs on the
BBB run at 200MHz and have shared memory with the main processor. The
PRUs run at much higher speeds than AVRs and are better suited for high-speed
applications like real-time motor control or video encoding/decoding. Although there is an example library provided by BeagleBoard.org,
the PRUs are more complicated and have a slightly higher learning
curve. The software support is not as mature as the Arduino project,
and for custom applications, one needs to program in assembly for the
PRU instruction set. However, if execution speed is critical for your
application, it may be worth your time to learn about the PRU.
</p><p>
When combining the ATmega328p and the BBB, you must consider the operating
voltages of both devices. The Arduino UNO, which is built around the Atmel
ATmega328p, operates at 5V, while the expansion headers on the BBB operate
at 3.3V. To combine the BBB and the ATmega328p, you must decide whether to
operate all components at 3.3V or use logic-level converters and supply
power to the ATmega328p at 5V. If operating at 3.3V, you also must reduce
the crystal frequency for the ATmega328p from 16MHz to 8MHz. For this
tutorial, I've chosen to keep all voltages at 3.3V, because the circuitry
is simpler, and I can afford the reduced processor speed.
</p><p>
This tutorial has three parts.
First, I describe the
hardware components and skills required to build the prototype. Second,
I detail the software required to power, program and communicate
with the microprocessor. And finally, I show how to upload sketches onto
the ATmega328p.

The Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
This project does require soldering. However, I have chosen to use only
through-hole components, which generally are easier to solder. If you
are new to soldering, the SparkFun Web site has some great tutorials (see
Resources).
</p><p>
For this project, you need the following components:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Soldering equipment (iron, solder).
</p></li><li><p>
(1) ATmega328p in DIP package.
</p></li><li><p>
(2) 22 pF capacitors (for the crystal).
</p></li><li><p>
(2) .1 uF capacitors (for decoupling).
</p></li><li><p>
(1) 8MHz crystal.
</p></li><li><p>
Hookup wire.
</p></li><li><p>
(1) 6-pin shrouded connector.
</p></li><li><p>
(1) Protoboard.
</p></li><li><p>
Male breakaway 0.1 inch pins.
</p></li><li><p>
AVR Programmer (AVR Pocket Programmer).
</p></li><li><p>
(Optional) AVR breakout board.
</p></li><li><p>
(1) LED.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
I've made a public SparkFun wish list that lists all of these components
(see Resources).
</p><p>
There are two ways to build the hardware for this project: the easy way is
to use a solderless breadboard to assemble the components, and the harder
way is to build a prototype cape. I generally try to get projects working
on a solderless breadboard first, before I start soldering components
onto a protoboard, but sometimes a breadboard introduces challenges
with poor connections. Refer to the Fritzing diagram for details of the
breadboard implementation (Figure 1).

</p></div></div><p>
If your ATmega328p already has a bootloader, you can skip the ISP
programming header, but it's very handy to flash a bootloader quickly or
sketch on the microprocessor if there is a problem. However, you should
not connect the ISP programmer to the board while connected to the
BeagleBone. The programmer is most likely using 5V, and the VCC line is
tied to the main power supply from the BBB, which is 3.3V. You could add
logic-level converters to make this safer, but it adds some complexity.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11649f2.large.jpg"><img src="11649f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Datko)
</p></div></div><p>
The benefit of using a protoboard is that you will have a much more stable
prototype, both electrically and mechanically. However, it requires more
of a time investment and significantly more soldering. The protoboard 
also requires some 0.1" male headers to attach into the BBB's expansion
headers. You could get away with soldering just the pins that are used
in this project, but I recommend attaching the entire 2x23 male headers.

The Software</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Flashing a Bootloader</b></span>
</p><p>
There are several ways to load a bootloader, including purchasing an
ATmega328p with a pre-installed bootloader. The method I chose was to use
the Arduino IDE and the AVR Pocket Programmer. To load the bootloader,
connect the six-pin ISP cable to your ISP header and the USB end to
your host computer. Select &ldquo;Power Target&rdquo; on the Pocket Programmer. In
the Arduino IDE, select a board type of &ldquo;Arduino Pro or Pro Mini (3.3V,
8MHz) w/ ATmega328&rdquo;. Under Programmer, select &ldquo;USBtinyISP&rdquo;. Then select
&ldquo;Burn Bootloader&rdquo;. After a few minutes, you should be rewarded with
the message &ldquo;Done burning Bootloader&rdquo;. With a bootloader installed,
disconnect the programmer and attach the cape to the BBB.

</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Preparing the BBB</b></span>
</p><p>
There are three wires required for the software reset and sketch
upload feature. Two are for serial Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL)
data transmit (TX) and receive (RX), and the third line is a General
Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pin, used to toggle the reset line. You
can manipulate the pins through the exported sysfs, but first you must
determine the pins to use. For the reset line, arbitrarily pick a
GPIO pin. For this example, pick pin P9_23, which is GPIO1_17. The BBB
System Reference Manual (SRM) contains the mapping of pins to pin mode
in Table 13 for the P9 Header.
</p><p>
Let's further break down the GPIO number. The 1 in GPIO1_17 refers
to the GPIO controller. There are four GPIO controllers on the BBB,
numbered 0 through 3. The second number, 17, is the pin ID on that GPIO
controller. The interface to the Linux kernel's GPIO driver requires
you to use a single GPIO number. Therefore, you need to understand the
mapping from the BBB's SRM GPIO naming convention to the kernel. To help
understand, mount the debugfs, if it's not already mounted with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, view the GPIO information with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
cat /sys/kernel/debug/gpio
</pre>
</p><p>
The result should be something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
GPIOs 0-31, gpio:
 gpio-6   (mmc_cd              ) in  hi

GPIOs 32-63, gpio:
 gpio-49  (sysfs               ) out hi
 gpio-52  (eMMC_RSTn           ) out lo
 gpio-53  (beaglebone:green:usr) out hi
 gpio-54  (beaglebone:green:usr) out lo
 gpio-55  (beaglebone:green:usr) out hi
 gpio-56  (beaglebone:green:usr) out lo
 gpio-59  (McASP Clock Enable P) out hi

GPIOs 64-95, gpio:

GPIOs 96-127, gpio:
</pre>
</p><p>
Here you see the four GPIO controllers on the BBB. The GPIO you want to
use is GPIO1_17, which you now know is on GPIO controller 1. You also now
know the offset. GPIO0 controls 32 GPIOs, 0&ndash;31. GPIO1 also controls 32
GPIOs, 32&ndash;63. You want the 17th GPIO on GPIO controller 1, which starts
at 32; therefore, the number you need is 32 + 17 = 49.
</p><p>
Now that you know the mapped pin number, you can control the pins from
userspace with basic shell scripting. It's a three-step process. First,
export the desired pin. Then, set the direction of the pin for either
input or output. Finally, set the pin to a logic high (&ldquo;1&rdquo;) or low
(&ldquo;0&rdquo;).
</p><p>
Export the pin with the following command, as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo 49 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/export
</pre>
</p><p>
With the pin now exported, set the direction and value with the following
two commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo out &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio49/direction
echo 1 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio49/value
</pre>
</p><p>
The first command declares the pin as an output, and the second command
sets the reset line high and powers the ATmega328p. Now your reset line
is ready to go.
</p><p>
It is a bit trickier to enable the TTL serial lines. Per the BBB SRM,
I've chosen UART4 TX and RX, which maps to P9_13 and P9_11. However,
because these are going to be used in a different mode, namely serial TTL,
the pins cannot be mapped like normal GPIOs. In this case, for the 3.8
kernel series on the BBB, it's easiest to build a device tree fragment
and load it at runtime with the BeagleBone's Cape Manager (Capemgr).
</p><p>
The BBB uses the Linux kernel's device tree system, but the Capemgr is a
BBB-specific solution. For complete BBB capes, during system startup,
the kernel will probe the four authorized EEPROM addresses and try to
match the cape name and version, stored in the EEPROM, with compiled
device tree files. But, it's also possible to load a compiled device
tree object at runtime from userspace.
</p><p>
The following snippet shows the key insight to configuring the device
tree on the BBB; it is based on the fragments for the BeagleBone Black
in am335x-bone-common.dsti (the complete code is in my GitHub repository
listed in the Resources section):


<pre     class="programlisting">

fragment@0 {
    target = &lt;&amp;am33xx_pinmux&gt;;
    __overlay__ {
        pinctrl_uart5: pinctrl_uart5_pins {
            pinctrl-single,pins = &lt;
                0x070 0x26  /* P9_11 = MODE6 */
                0x074 0x06  /* P9_13 = MODE6 */
            &gt;;
        };
    };
};

</pre>
</p><p>
The &ldquo;magic&rdquo; numbers contained in the
<tt  >pinctrl-single,pins</tt> property warrant
some explanation. This device tree snippet is changing the mode of the
pins with the kernel's Pin Control subsystem. Specifically, the driver
is the <tt  >pinctrl-single</tt> driver. The documentation for that driver states
that the first 32-bit value in the two 32-bit value pair (known as
&ldquo;cells&rdquo;
in the device tree documentation) is a register offset whose value to be
set is the second 32-bit value. The source document that describes the
registers is the ARM Cortex-A8 AM335x's Technical Reference Manual. This
is the manual for the processor on the BBB. The second value is a hex
encoding for the mode and control for that pin. The least significant
six bits of this value are encoded per Table 1. 
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x1695580.0x1b87e90"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Bit Encoding</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. Bit Encoding11649t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Bit</th><th>0</th><th>1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6 - Slew Control</td><td>Fast</td><td>Slow</td></tr><tr><td>5 - Receiver Active</td><td>Disabled</td><td>Enabled</td></tr><tr><td>4 - Pullup or Pulldown</td><td>Pulldown</td><td>Pullup</td></tr><tr><td>3 - Enable Pulls</td><td>Enabled</td><td>Disabled</td></tr><tr><td>2,1,0 - Mux Mode</td><td>Mode 0 through 7</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
In this example, P9_11 is decoded as follows: fast slew control, receiver
active, internal pulldowns are disabled, and mode 6. In the BBB System
Reference Manual, mode 6 for this pin corresponds to UART4_RXD, which
is exactly what you want.
</p><p>
With the device tree source in hand, compile the file with the device
tree compiler (dtc), copy it to the /lib/firmware directory and enable
the overlay.


<pre     class="programlisting">
dtc -O dtb -o enable-uart5-00A0.dtbo -b 0 -@ enable-uart5.dts

cp enable-uart5-00A0.dtbo /lib/firmware/
echo enable-uart5 &gt; /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.*/slots
</pre>
</p><p>
If dtc complains about the @ symbol, update dtc with the following
script:


<pre     class="programlisting">
wget -c https://raw.github.com/RobertCNelson/tools/master/pkgs/dtc.sh
chmod +x dtc.sh
./dtc.sh
</pre>
</p><p>
This will download a patched version of the dtc that supports this
feature.
</p><p>
Run <tt  >dmesg|tail</tt> to verify that the device tree was loaded
successfully,
and you should see messages similar to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

</p><p>
The last line tells you that the serial device, /dev/ttyO4, is now ready.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1695580.0x1b88d00"></a>
Uploading Sketches</h2></div></div><p>
With the hardware in place and the interfaces ready, there are two
pieces remaining. You need a mechanism to transmit sketches from the host
computer to the BBB, and then you need a mechanism to upload the sketch to
the ATmega328p. The first piece can be solved in numerous ways. I wrote
a simple Python Web server that receives sketches via a POST and then
launches the script to flash the ATmega328p. There are lots of examples
of how to do this in Python, so I'll leave this as an exercise for the
reader. Although, you can take a look at server.py in my GitHub repo
for this tutorial listed in the Resources section for an example.
</p><p>
The Arduino IDE compiles and uploads sketches directly from the GUI. You
still can use the IDE to compile sketches, but your BBB programmer
isn't supported. In the Arduino preferences, select verbose output for
compilation. When you compile your sketch, the output window will show
the location of your compiled file which should be something like:
Blink.cpp.hex.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11649f8.large.jpg"><img src="11649f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Selecting verbose compilation is helpful
in finding the compiled sketch.
</p></div></div><p>
The script to upload the sketch to the ATmega328p is a bit
trickier. Before proceeding, install the avrdude package on the BBB.
Avrdude is the &ldquo;AVR Downloader/UplodDEr&rdquo; and is the back-end utility
that the Arduino IDE uses to upload sketches. Avrdude alone should be
sufficient, but if you want the full tools on your BBB, install the
following extra packages:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
gcc-avr 
</p></li><li><p>
binutils-avr 
</p></li><li><p>
gdb-avr avr-lib
</p></li></ul></div><p>
This script works on the principle that the ATmega328p bootloader
will monitor the serial TTL lines shortly after a reset for incoming
programs. Therefore, you must coordinate the reset of the ATmega328p with
the start of the transmission. Use the following bash snippet to upload
the sketch:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/bash
if [ "$#" -lt 1 ]
then
  echo "Usage: $0 sketch.cpp.hex [time to sleep]"
  exit 1
fi

pin=49
serial=/dev/ttyO4

if [ "$2" == "" ]; then
   tts=.9
else
   tts=$2
fi

echo Waiting $tts seconds

(echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio$pin/value \
    &amp;&amp; sleep $tts \
    &amp;&amp; echo 1 &gt; \
    /sys/class/gpio/gpio$pin/value) &amp;

avrdude -c arduino -p m328p -b 57600 -v \
    -P $serial -U flash:w:$1

</pre>
</p><p>
The first command splits off a subshell that will toggle the reset
line. After a brief delay, the <tt  >avrdude</tt> command flashes the sketch. Use
the <tt  >-c</tt> option to indicate the arduino programmer, which is the closest
setup to this hardware. Since the processor is running at 8MHz vs. 16MHz,
cut the serial baud rate in half (<tt  >-b 57600</tt>).
</p><p>
You may need to adjust the timing values. A logic analyzer is very
helpful in this situation to see the logic levels; otherwise, you are
left to trial and error. If you intend to dive deeper into hardware,
a logic analyzer is well worth your investment.
</p><p>
The text should scroll by and you should see output similar to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
avrdude: reading input file "sketch.hex"
avrdude: input file sketch.hex auto detected as
         Intel Hex

If you've uploaded the standard Arduino Blink sketch, the LED on your
cape should be blinking! Congratulations, you've just programmed the
ATmega328p from your BeagleBone Black!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1695580.0x1a9a008"></a>
Next Steps</h2></div></div><p>
This project showed the minimal configuration needed to program an
ATmega328p from a BBB. Serial TTL is just one way to communicate with
the ATmega329p, however. Many devices can be connected on the I2C bus,
including the ATmega328p. What's nice about I2C on the BBB is I2C is
enabled by default on pins P9_19 and P9_20. There are no extra device tree
overlays or steps required to configure this. Also, both the BBB and the
ATmega328p can communicate over the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus.
</p><p>
Be warned, hardware hacking is addictive! The first time you build a
semi-complicated circuit and watch the LED blink in front of you, it's
like the first time you booted into your modified kernel. Have fun and
Happy Hacking!
