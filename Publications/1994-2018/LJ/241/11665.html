&ldquo;Do you know Linux? WE AE HIRING!&rdquo; That's what billboards from HostGator
(<a href="http://www.hostgator.com" target="_self">www.hostgator.com</a>)
have been saying for the past several years. That company is not alone. Demand for
Linux talent is high and getting higher. In a February 2014 report
(<a href="http://marketing.dice.com/pdf/LinuxJobsReport_2014.pdf" target="_self">marketing.dice.com/pdf/LinuxJobsReport_2014.pdf</a>), the
Linux Foundation and Dice detailed a picture that was already obvious:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The explosive demand for Linux talent is intensifying. Seventy seven
percent of hiring managers have &ldquo;hiring Linux talent&rdquo; on their list of
priorities for 2014, up from 70 percent a year ago. More than nine in ten
hiring managers plan to bring Linux professionals on board in the next six
months. Furthermore, 46 percent plan to boost their hiring of Linux pros in
2014, a 3-point increase over 2012.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And that's not all:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Linux professionals know they're a hot item, and they're fully aware of how
their skills have contributed to their success in the workplace. In fact, a
full 86 percent of survey respondents said that knowing Linux has advanced
their career opportunities. But when asked why they sought out a Linux
career in the first place, only 17 percent ranked money and perks highest.
Instead, 51 percent cited their passion for Linux, and 64 percent wanted to
work with Linux because of its pervasiveness in modern-day technology
infrastructure.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Exactly the same could have been said of DOS in 1985 and Windows a decade
later. It cannot be said of either today, even though both still are used
all over the place. In 2012, for example, United Airlines moved its
reservation system to SHARES
(<a href="http://servicesangle.com/blog/2012/03/08/united-airlines-goes-from-the-web-to-dos" target="_self">servicesangle.com/blog/2012/03/08/united-airlines-goes-from-the-web-to-dos</a>), which runs on DOS. And Microsoft's sundowning
of Windows XP (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/endofsupport.aspx" target="_self">www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enterprise/endofsupport.aspx</a>) seems to have given cramps to nearly the entire retail
banking industry
(<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/20/5326772/windows-xp-powers-95-percent-of-atms-worldwide" target="_self">www.theverge.com/2014/1/20/5326772/windows-xp-powers-95-percent-of-atms-worldwide</a>),
which finally will move its ATM machines from XP to
Windows 7
(<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/atms-face-deadline-to-upgrade-from-windows-xp#p2" target="_self">www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-16/atms-face-deadline-to-upgrade-from-windows-xp#p2</a>)
or to Linux
(<a href="http://www.atmmarketplace.com/article/129594/Brazilian-banks-look-to-Linux-for-ATMs" target="_self">www.atmmarketplace.com/article/129594/Brazilian-banks-look-to-Linux-for-ATMs</a>).
It's not going to Windows 8, which Supersite for
Windows (<a href="http://winsupersite.com" target="_self">winsupersite.com</a>) guru Paul Thurrot calls
&ldquo;a debacle&rdquo;
(<a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/threshold-be-called-windows-9-ship-april-2015" target="_self">winsupersite.com/windows-8/threshold-be-called-windows-9-ship-april-2015</a>)
and says is &ldquo;tanking harder
than Microsoft is comfortable discussing in public&rdquo;. He also says the next
version of Windows, code-named Threshold, &ldquo;recasts Windows 8 as the next
Vista&rdquo;, adding &ldquo;there's no way to sugarcoat this. Windows 8 has set back
Microsoft, and Windows, by years, and possibly for good.&rdquo;
</p><p>
According to Ali R. Babaoglan, who, presumably, pays to read Gartner's
expensive reports
(<a href="http://www.alibabaoglan.com/blog/gartners-technology-predictions-2014-2015-2016" target="_self">www.alibabaoglan.com/blog/gartners-technology-predictions-2014-2015-2016</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
90 percent of enterprises will bypass broad-scale deployment of Windows 8.
Gartner claims that most enterprises and their trusted management vendors
are not yet prepared for the change to Windows 8, and says enterprises will
want to wait for more stability before proceeding. While Microsoft as a
technology company can make these changes at a more advanced pace, the
market will take time to mature, and most enterprises will sit on the
sideline for now.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
In today's world, the closest thing to Windows' longtime domination of PCs
is Android's domination of mobile devices. There the only thing keeping
Android from prevailing as utterly as Microsoft once did over PCs is Apple
devices running iOS. According to comScore's January 2014 report
(<a href="https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2014/3/comScore_Reports_January_2014_US_Smartphone_Subscriber_Market_Share" target="_self">https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2014/3/comScore_Reports_January_2014_US_Smartphone_Subscriber_Market_Share</a>), Android
led smartphone platforms in the US with a 51.7% share, followed by Apple
(iOS) with 41.6%, then Microsoft (Windows Phone,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone</a>) with 3.2% and BlackBerry
with 3.1%. More telling is the number of OEMs making phones for each
operating system. Apple and BlackBerry have just one each: themselves.
Microsoft has HTC, Nokia and Samsung. Android has HTC, Samsung and all the
rest (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Android_devices" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Android_devices</a>), which
are too many to list. According to Sundar Pichai
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai</a>), the Senior VP
who oversees apps at Google, more than a billion devices running Android
have been activated
(<a href="https://plus.google.com/+SundarPichai/posts/NeBW7AjT1QM" target="_self">https://plus.google.com/+SundarPichai/posts/NeBW7AjT1QM</a>).

Microsoft would be far wiser to join that juggernaut than to fight it. And,
if it does, here are a few things Microsoft could bring to the
Linux/Android table that nobody else will, including Google:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft is a personal computing
company.</b></span> It started with the gleam that
appeared in Bill Gates' eye when he saw the MITS Altair, and it's still
there. Google, on the other hand, is a server computing company. Servers
gleamed in Larry Page's and Sergey Brin's eyes when they first put Google
Search atop a pile of Linux boxes, and it's still there too. One thing
companies can't change is where they come from, and Microsoft has a huge
legacy advantage on the personal front.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>I mean, really personal.</b></span> The customers Microsoft cares most about are
individual human beings, not just B2B corporate ones. Microsoft has vast
call centers with well-trained people whose job is to solve individual
customers' problems. Got a problem with Gmail or Google Maps? Try calling
somebody. It soon will be clear that Google would rather not talk to any
users personally, much less operate a call center. (A high-level Google
executive once told me that Google wouldn't operate call centers for
ordinary folk because that would&mdash;no kidding&mdash;result in revenues
of less than $1 million per employee.)
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linux could use a personal touch.</b></span> Depending on the kindness of geek friends
and strangers isn't enough, and never has been. It should be clear by now
that Linux could use a first-rank tech giant willing to get personal with
individual customers. The old usual suspects&mdash;IBM, SAP, Oracle, HP and
so on&mdash;are B2B companies at heart and never have been comfortable
dealing with the creatures they call &ldquo;end users&rdquo;.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft would be in a buyer's market for
talent.</b></span> Perhaps the most
brilliant thing Apple ever did was give Macintosh obsessives a place to
work and a &ldquo;genius&rdquo; title. I would bet there are far more Linux obsessives
who deserve the same title, and would be glad to help Microsoft make the
most of Linux, and to help both customers and users do the same.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft and Linux DNA already are beginning to
mix.</b></span> Exhibit A: the
Microsoft/SUSE Alliance (<a href="https://www.moreinterop.com" target="_self">https://www.moreinterop.com</a>). Yes, it's a B2B one (in compliance with demand by
countless businesses for mixed Linux/Windows solutions), but it could
easily expand into B2C as well.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft + Linux would give IT a new lease on
life.</b></span> For the past several
years, IT budgets have been shrinking and/or shifting
(<a href="http://chiefmartec.com/2011/12/follow-the-money-from-it-to-marketing" target="_self">chiefmartec.com/2011/12/follow-the-money-from-it-to-marketing</a>) over to marketing and
other departments. One big reason is that Windows is moribund while Linux's
strength has been in servers and embedded (especially mobile). By embracing
Linux for desktops and laptops, Microsoft would cover the entire non-Apple
desktop, laptop and mobile waterfront inside the enterprise.
</p></li><li><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft + Linux would create a whole new
hardware OEM game.</b></span> Back in the
Windows 95, 98, NT and XP days, when Microsoft said &ldquo;Jump!&rdquo; every desktop
and laptop OEM would say &ldquo;How high?&rdquo; Then Bill Gates left, Windows got
lame, Apple got hot, and mobile got hotter. As a result, Windows hardware
OEMs have been bailing and failing left and right. IBM unloaded its PC
hardware business on Lenovo in 2005
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#Acquisition_by_Lenovo" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad#Acquisition_by_Lenovo</a>). HP announced it was folding its PC
business in 2011
(<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/08/18/technology/hp_pc_spinoff/index.htm?iid=EL" target="_self">money.cnn.com/2011/08/18/technology/hp_pc_spinoff/index.htm?iid=EL</a>), when it still had the market lead. (It reversed the
decision later, but the damage was done.) Then Dell fell into so much
trouble that it made moves to go private (with help from Microsoft) a few
months ago
(<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/05/us-dell-buyout-idUSBRE9140NF20130205" target="_self">www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/05/us-dell-buyout-idUSBRE9140NF20130205</a>). In all three cases, the direction was away from personal
devices and toward corporate service offerings. For all those reasons and
more, Microsoft became its own OEM with Surface tablets in 2012
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2012/jun12/06-18announce.aspx" target="_self">www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2012/jun12/06-18announce.aspx</a>). Ever used
one? They're pretty slick.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Remember how Bill Gates didn't get the Internet at first, and then turned a
180 in 1995? Read the memo
(<a href="http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/05/0526bill-gates-internet-memo/all" target="_self">www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/05/0526bill-gates-internet-memo/all</a>). Linux wasn't on Bill's radar at the time, but
BSD was. The top item under &ldquo;actions required for the Windows
platform&rdquo;
begins this way:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
1. Server. BSD is working on offering the best Internet server as an
integrated package. We need to understand how to make NT boxes the highest
performance HTTP servers.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Today the reality of Linux is of a piece with the reality of the Internet.
Neither is going away. Both are co-evolving in the minds of every geek
adding value to them. Both transcend the interests of every company
contributing to them, including Google. If Satya Nadella
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella</a>) looks at reality
with the same clear eyes Bill Gates cast on the Internet in 1995, he might
see the wisdom of embracing Linux with the same enthusiasm and commitment.
</p><p>
How would Microsoft do that, exactly? It could start by joining the Linux
Foundation (<a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org" target="_self">www.linuxfoundation.org</a>) and perhaps by purchasing
Attachmate (<a href="http://www.attachmate.com" target="_self">www.attachmate.com</a>), which owns SUSE, plus
what's left of Novell
(<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/attachmate-reveals-novell-suse-and-linux-plans/8771" target="_self">www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/attachmate-reveals-novell-suse-and-linux-plans/8771</a>). 
But I think the easiest route would be to <span   class="emphasis"><em>open
source the intention</em></span>. Nadella could start by announcing a round of hiring
toward harmonizing Linux and Windows, and in the process ask the geek world
what Microsoft should do, specifically. I guarantee that the answers will
be better than any one of us alone can imagine. And that will be good for
Microsoft, Linux and everybody who depends on both.
