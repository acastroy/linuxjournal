Choice of Words</h4><p>
I am a longtime subscriber to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> and generally am very happy
with the magazine. Unfortunately, I was very sick in December and early
January and only got around to catching up now.
</p><p>
In Shawn Powers' mini-article on Pixlr in the December 2013 issue, I was surprised and
disappointed to see his casual use of an epithet used against the disabled.
I have always lived with the name of The GIMP because it purports to be an
acronym. The use of the word gimp or gimpy is offensive to many who live with
physical disabilities and their friends. This is especially true of the
manner in which it was used here to suggest something that is weak or
worthless.
</p><p>
However appealing the matching sounds might be, I suggest you resist the
temptation much as you have so far managed to do with nigger, jew, fag and
retard.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Keith Nunn  <br><br>
</p><p>
I appreciate the letter, and hope you know I meant no offense. I can see
at the end claiming Pixlr wasn't &ldquo;gimpy&rdquo; was perhaps a poor choice of words.
Thank you for bringing it to my attention. I far prefer to hear about such
things than to remain ignorant.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Cat Photos Encryption</h4><p>
First of all, I am very grateful to Shawn Powers for his tips and tricks,
which always are fun to read and interesting, especially his latest article about
encryption, which is very well explained and crystal clear, as understanding
how encryption actually works behind the scenes is not trivial. [See Shawn
Powers'
&ldquo;Encrypting Your Cat Photos&rdquo; in the January 2014 issue.]
</p><p>
This helped me to encrypt my USB sticks successfully. However, I ran into
an error regarding the formatting command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkfs.vfat /dev/mapper/my_crypto_disk -n my_crypto_disk
unable to get drive geometry, using default 255/63
</pre>
</p><p>
I tried again with the option <tt  >-F 32</tt> for a fat32 partition type:


<pre     class="programlisting">
mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/mapper/my_crypto_disk -n my_crypto_disk
unable to get drive geometry, using default 255/63
</pre>
</p><p>
This is not harmful, and the USB drive is encrypted and can be mounted
after the passphrase is entered. I just wanted to mention it to see if anyone
had
an explanation. Maybe it's a bug from my distribution (Kubuntu).
</p><p>
Keep up the good work. 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Patrick Wolf  <br><br>
</p><p>
I haven't seen your exact error, so I'm completely guessing (always
dangerous), but I suspect it might be the USB drive itself, or more
specifically, its embedded controller. Perhaps the controller itself doesn't
give the geometry when queried. I'm curious if it would give the same error if
encryption were taken out of the picture. Either way, thanks for the
letter.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Ubuntu vs. Fedora&mdash;a Reader's Test</h4><p>
In testing Fedora against Ubuntu, trying to be unbiased, I used the full Ubuntu
64-bit on what could be labeled an under-powered machine: a 1GB of RAM
Gateway media tower from 2005 with a 512MB NVIDIA EVGA card and a Sound
Blaster Audigy 2ZS. In terms of speed and boot up, Fedora is the winner, but
in terms of stability and in staying with gaming, the Ubuntu blows it out of
the water&mdash;no hangups, no slow downs and even when loading the
comprehensive OpenSUSE, full KDE, my system still stays with it. As
unimpressed as I am, the Internet browsing through Midori was far worse then
anything I've seen since Windows 98. In switching to Google Chrome, it hits
on usability until it experiences far too many out of memory errors. If
this is an LXDE release for Fedora 20, it seems like it's not ready for
prime time, and they may want to create long-term support options before
they go through with systems that are hurt by less time in working
situations. This entire release review was done on Fedora 20, and I'd really
like to, well, like Fedora again, having used it since Fedora 13. But all in
all, it's not really an operating system as much as it is becoming an
exercise in futility.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Joseph Ziehm  <br><br>
</p><p>
I don't have any experience with LXDE on Fedora, but in general, I think the
desktop manager isn't quite as mature as its counterparts. Although not quite as
efficient (depending on whom you ask), I've been very impressed with recent
releases of XFCE. My main operating system currently is Debian with
XFCE.&mdash;Shawn Powers

Mars Needs Older Women</h4><p>
I would like to weigh in on the discussion involving the lack of women in
the Linux field (and IT in general). I found a rare contemporary in Rose
Dlhopolsky's letter in the February 2014 issue. We are both females in our
fifties who have been using Linux for a long time.
</p><p>
I installed Linux for the first time in 1999. I didn't know anyone else who
used it, so I had to figure everything out myself. Sometimes it worked,
sometimes it didn't. I avoided the local LUG because it seemed to be filled
with young men who didn't take this old gal too seriously. In fact, there
are almost <span   class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> women my age in IT.
</p><p>
I fell in love with Linux and technology. I taught myself Web design and
hosted my own Web server for many years. I learned Python and wrote/released
a program I'm proud of. I taught computer apps in the public schools and in
private institutions. I am proud to be a self-taught geek, but I still feel
like an oddball at Linux conventions and gatherings where I see no one who
looks like me.
</p><p>
I grew up in a different world. In the 1960s in the US, women were not
expected ever to work outside the home. Girls were not allowed in the shop
classes, but were required to take Home Economics (cooking and sewing). The
only vocational-type class the girls could take was typing, because, you
know, they might be secretaries. (Luckily, keyboarding turned out to be a
useful skill a few generations later.)
</p><p>
Women were not allowed to have credit in their own names, and they could never
buy a car, a house or have a credit card without a man to co-sign. Birth
control became available, and for the first time, women could control when
and if they got pregnant.
</p><p>
Somewhere while I was growing up, the rules changed. Suddenly, women were
expected to work, although girls of my generation had never been prepared
for that world. Economics forced most families to require two incomes. Most
women gravitated toward traditional fields: secretaries, teachers and
nursing.
</p><p>
Somehow, I found and nourished my inner geek, but my community is on-line
where my age and sex doesn't matter, and is usually unknown. But in the
real world, it is a lonely place for an older, female geek.

In Response to Okay, Google</h4><p>
Regarding Shawn Powers' &ldquo;Okay, Google&rdquo; piece in the February 2014
Upfront section: yes, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Trek IV</em></span> was awesome. To this day, I still mimic Scotty picking up
the mouse and speaking to it when I find that a PC or Mac's performance is
slower than what I feel it should be&mdash;especially when assisting 
clients/customers with computer issues and their patience is wearing thin, it
helps to lighten the moment. Using my Nexus 10, I use voice commands
occasionally but have found its use limiting or wanting still. Eventually,
this will be improved but not for everyday use yet. Not to mention that
talking to my Nexus has had the effect of causing my cube neighbors to have
a phone in hand ready to call security.
</p><p>
This brings me to the point that I find voice interaction with a device as
archaic, and it tends to disturb others around me (imagine doing that on a
plane)&mdash;at least as a sole or primary way of interaction. I believe it has
its uses, but I would find it annoying and limiting after a while. Our
interaction with &ldquo;people&rdquo; is more than voice and listening. It
also includes 
visual body language. So, not only do I want to be able to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to my
computing device, I want it to &ldquo;see&rdquo; my body language and cues,
and with that
ability, I want to be able to give it commands with hand gestures or even
facial expressions
(brings a whole new definition to the &ldquo;cube-dance&rdquo;). The computing device
should not always respond back audibly or visually but also with perhaps
some robotic gesture&mdash;whatever is an appropriate (based on
programming/user preference) response to indicate that the device
understood and is carrying out the command.
</p><p>
However, so that we don't turn whole offices into dance clubs, the gestures
detected should be relatively small. The voice commands given should be
almost whispers, and the visual cues limited to the display devices in the
immediate location of the user and the robotic device limited to a certain
area. Privacy is of concern here too. This brings up how to detect such
small gestures and hear nearly inaudible commands. Today's devices (mics,
Kinect and so on) are limited to detecting only loud voices or exaggerated gestures (I
do not want to have a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Minority Report</em></span>-like special room or office
either).
</p><p>
Science-fiction author, Vernor Vinge, in the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Rainbows
End</em></span>, has a vision of
nano-technology that is embedded in clothing, small hearing-aide devices and
contact lenses. The computing device is no larger than our current cell
phones. Clothing contains all the &ldquo;detection&rdquo; devices to read body language
and gestures. Hearing aides hear your voice as well as respond with audio.
Contact lenses have embedded nano-technology that polarizes light to
make visual responses &ldquo;part of the user-acute vision&rdquo; without
giving the feeling
of looking through a heads-up display, but rather the visual cues become
part of what you are looking at. The contact lenses also serve as a camera,
detecting the focused image on the back of the retina. The computing device
and nano-technology/devices are able to communicate wirelessly (in a close
proximity) in a mesh network fashion.
</p><p>
That sort of technology, while it maybe a ways off, is sounding more
plausible each day. I believe Vernor Vinge is on to something here. This
type of interaction with computing devices is much more preferable to me. I
can ride in a subway and do work or communicate with someone across the
country or in another country doing nothing more than tapping my knee or
whispering to myself (along with old lady beside me). I also can stare
blankly at the floor and see what my next stop is or read the news. I'd like to
look
out over a landscape and have the name of mountains or even buildings in a
cityscape appear or have the name of some specific landmark appear. Or, I'd like
the automatic
translation of a foreign language that I can hear but the person
speaking cannot. And when I am wearing this technology, I do not want to look like
Iron Man or RoboCop. In fact, most people should not be able to see or
detect that I am wearing/using it. I just want the technology to be an
augmentation to my daily life.
</p><p>
Although a &ldquo;cranial implant&rdquo; may sound like a cool way to interface, I find
that &ldquo;invasive&rdquo; (not to mention that many science-fiction authors have been able to
envision its abuses). Of course, all technology has the potential for
abuse, but the above nano-technology has fewer risks of being
&ldquo;invasive&rdquo;, as it
uses less power and doesn't actually penetrate the body. And, it wouldn't
turn the office place into a dance club or make me look like Iron Man.
I am sure this technology could be set up for abuse,
but it is more palatable and compatible with everyday life, in my opinion.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
mshives   <br><br>
</p><p>
I do often tease about a cranial implant, and part of me would like some sort
of direct interaction, but really my feelings are similar to yours, especially
when it comes to speaking out loud to/from devices. In all honestly, I hope
sub-vocal communication can be perfected so we can silently interact with a
computer system. You played the nerd card with Vernor Vinge, so I'll do the
same&mdash;the &ldquo;jewel&rdquo; Ender used to communicate with Jane in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Speaker for the
Dead</em></span> I think was an idealistic evolution of the current Bluetooth earpiece. We
really do live in an awesome time, no?&mdash;Shawn Powers

Electronic vs. Paper</h4><p>
It strikes me that those people who prefer to read a paper edition of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> could print out their PDF version (two
sides, two pages/side) much more
cheaply than <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> could print and mail it. You could even keep them in
a loose-leaf binder.
</p><p>
I myself find reading the PDF on a Xoom tablet quite satisfactory except
for the time it takes Xoom to load the pages.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Eric Beversluis  <br><br>
</p><p>
It is admittedly not as nice to read a printout as opposed to a regular paper
magazine. That said, tablets are making digital magazines far more enjoyable to
read than they were even a year ago. I also like the potential for interactive
features and clickable links that the paper version just doesn't support. Like
I've mentioned before, however, there certainly are options if people want a
physical copy, it's just not a service we offer ourselves.&mdash;Shawn Powers

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> iOS App</h4><p>
I've been an <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> subscriber for about six years now. I really grew tired of
reading all of the negative feedback when <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> went digital. At the time, I
was downloading the PDF versions and reading them in a PDF reading app on
my iPad. Somehow, I just now discovered the iOS app. I primarily use my
iPad for reading, and I am quite pleased with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> iOS app. I'm
impressed with the ability to switch to text mode, the options for zooming
in and out, and increasing the font size when in text mode. Overall, I
believe it gives me an even better experience than reading the PDF version.
It also gives me the closest experience to reading it the &ldquo;old-fashioned
way&rdquo; (on paper) as possible. Keep up the good work!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jonathan Calloway  <br><br>
</p><p>
The &ldquo;app&rdquo; was a bit rough around the edges at first, but I agree, it's getting
nicer. I enjoy the one-click download feature the app provides, as opposed to
somehow copying the PDF/ePub to your tablet. I must admit, however, I do still
look at the PDF fairly often, as it has a familiar layout for me.&mdash;Shawn
Powers

Jim Hall's Usability Article</h4><p>
Jim Hall's piece on usability in the December 2013 issue was dead on and important. I recently
learned that the success of Apple is in part a function of allowing a small
number of highly talented designers make most of the major decisions in
development. That is a top-down approach that seems to have merit, even if
it needs to be washed down with a slug of kool-aid now and then. In OSS,
usability needs to be more bottom-up, which is why it is like folding the
laundry. Since you are just going to wear the clothes and wash them again,
it hardly seems worthwhile. In community-driven projects, one hopes we can
see more recruitment of people who like to fold the laundry.
</p><p>
One problem, though. I've heard usability testing was done for Unity.
That's hard to explain.
