    Last month, we inaugurated a column on Linux kernel programming with an
    article on how to write Linux device drivers without doing any kernel
    programming. This month we touch the kernel as we explore block device
    drivers.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2918580.0x2a10450"></a></h2></div></div><p>It is customary for authors explaining
device drivers to start with a complete explanation of character
devices, saving block device drivers for a later chapter. To
explain why this is, I need to briefly introduce character devices
as well. To do that, I'll give a little history.
</p><p>When Unix was written 25 years ago, its design was eclectic.
One unusual design feature was that every physical device connected
to the computer was represented as a file. This was a bold
decision, because many devices are very different from one another,
especially at first glance. Why use the same interface to talk to a
printer as to talk to a disk drive?</p><p>The short answer is that while the devices are very much
different, they can be thought of as having most of the same
characteristics as files. The entire system is then kept smaller
and simpler by only using one interface with a few
extensions.</p><p>This is fine, except that it hides important differences
between devices. For example, it is possible to read any byte on a
disk at any time, but it is only possible to read the
<span   class="bold"><b>next</b></span> byte from a terminal.</p><p>There are other differences, but this is the most fundamental
one: Some devices (like disks) are
<span   class="bold"><b>random-access</b></span>, and others (like
terminals) are <span   class="bold"><b>sequential-access</b></span>.
Of course, it is possible to pretend that a random-access device is
a sequential-access device, but it doesn't work the other way
around.</p><p>A practical effect of the difference is that filesystems can
only be mounted on block devices, not on character ones. For
example, most tapes are <span   class="bold"><b>character</b></span>
devices. It is possible to copy the contents of a raw, quiescent
(unmounted and not being modified) filesystem to a tape, but you
will not be able to mount the tape, even though it contains the
same information as the disk.</p><p>Most textbooks and tutorials start by explaining character
devices, the sequential-access ones, because a minimal character
device driver is easier to write than a minimal block device
driver. My own <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Kernel Hackers' Guide</em></span>
(the <span   class="emphasis"><em>KHG</em></span>) is written the same way.</p><p>My reason for starting this column with block devices, the
random-access devices, is that the KHG explains simple character
devices better than it does block devices, and I think that there
is a greater need for information on block devices right now.
Furthermore, <span   class="bold"><b>real</b></span> character device
drivers can be quite complex, just as complex as block device
drivers, and fewer people know how to write block device
drivers.</p><p>I am not going to give a complete example of a device driver
here. I am going to explain the important parts, and let you
discover the rest by examining the Linux source code. Reading this
article and the ramdisk driver
(<b  >drivers/block/ramdisk.c</b>), and possibly some
parts of the KHG, should make it possible for you to write a
simple, non-interrupt-driven block device driver, good enough to
mount a filesystem on. To write an interrupt-driven driver, read
<b  >drivers/block/hd.c</b>, the AT hard disk driver, and
follow along. I've included a few hints in this article, as
well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2918580.0x2a10b30"></a>The Heart of the Driver</h2></div></div><p>Whereas character device drivers provide procedures for
directly reading and writing data from and to the device they
drive, block devices do not. Instead, they provide a single
<b  >request()</b> procedure which is used for both
reading and writing. There are generic
<b  >block_read()</b> and
<b  >block_write()</b> procedures which know how to call
the <b  >request()</b> procedure, but all you need to
know about those functions is to place a reference to them in the
right place, and that will be covered later.</p><p>The <b  >request()</b> procedure (perhaps
surprisingly for a function designed to do I/O) takes no arguments
and returns void. Instead of explicit input and return values, it
looks at a queue of requests for I/O, and processes the requests
one at a time, in order. (The requests have already been sorted by
the time the <b  >request()</b> function reads the
queue.) When it is called, if it is not interrupt-driven, it
processes requests for blocks to be read from the device, until it
has exhausted all pending requests. (Normally, there will be only
one request in the queue, but the <b  >request()</b>
procedure should check until it is empty. Note that other requests
may be added to the queue by other processes while the current
request is being processed.)</p><p>On the other hand, if the device is interrupt-driven, the
<b  >request()</b> procedure will usually schedule an
interrupt to take place, and then let the interrupt handling
procedure call <b  >end_request()</b> (more on
<b  >end_request()</b> later) and then call the
<b  >request()</b> procedure again to schedule the next
request (if any) to be processed.</p><p>An idealized non-interrupt-driven
<b  >request()</b> procedure looks something like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
static void do_foo_request(void) {
repeat:
  INIT_REQUEST;
  /* check to make sure that the request is for a
     valid physical device */
  if (!valid_foo_device(CURRENT-&gt;dev)) {
     end_request(0);
     goto repeat;
  }
  if (CURRENT-&gt;cmd == WRITE) {
     if (foo_write(
          CURRENT-&gt;sector,
          CURRENT-&gt;buffer,
          CURRENT-&gt;nr_sectors &lt; 9)) {
        /* successful write */
        end_request(1);
        goto repeat;
     } else
        end_request(0);
        goto repeat;
     }
  if (CURRENT-&gt;cmd == READ) {
     if (foo_read(
          CURRENT-&gt;sector,
          CURRENT-&gt;buffer,
          CURRENT-&gt;nr_sectors &lt;&lt; 9)) {
        /* successful read */
        end_request(1);
        goto repeat;
     } else
        end_request(0);
        goto repeat;
     }
  }
}
</pre><p>The first thing you notice about this function may be that it
never explicitly returns. It does not run off the end and return,
and there is no return statement. This is not a bug; the
<b  >INIT_REQUEST</b> macro takes care of this for us. It
checks the request queue and, if there are no requests in the
queue, it returns. It does some simple sanity checks on the new
<b  >CURRENT</b> request if there is another request in
the queue to make <b  >CURRENT</b>.</p><p>CURRENT is defined by default as</p><pre     class="programlisting">
blk_dev[MAJOR_NR].current_request
</pre><p>in drivers <b  >/block/blk.h</b>. (We will cover
<b  >MAJOR_NR</b> and <b  >blk.h</b> later.)
This is the <span   class="bold"><b>current</b></span> request, the
one at the head of the request queue that is being processed. The
request structure includes all the information needed to process
the request, including the device, the command (read or write;
we'll assume read here), which sector is being read, the number of
sectors to read, a pointer to memory to store the data in, and a
pointer to the next request. There is more than that, but that's
all we are concerned with.
</p><p>The <b  >sector</b> variable contains the block
number. The length of a sector is specified when the device is
initialized (more later), and the sectors are numbered
consecutively, starting at 0. If the physical device is addressed
by some means other than sectors, it is the responsibility of the
<b  >request()</b> procedure to translate.</p><p>In some cases, a command may read or write more than one
sector. In those cases, the <b  >nr_sectors</b> variable
contains the number of contiguous sectors to read or write.</p><p><b  >end_request()</b> is called whenever the
<b  >CURRENT</b> request has been processed&mdash;either
satisfied or aborted.</p><p>If it has been satisfied, it is called with an argument of 1
and, if it has been aborted, it is called with an argument of 0. It
complains if the request was aborted, does magic with the buffer
cache, removes the processed request from the queue, &ldquo;ups&rdquo; a
semaphore if the request was for swapping, and wakes up all
processes that were waiting for a request to complete.</p><p>It may allow a task switch to occur if one is needed.</p><p><b  >end_request()</b> is a static function defined
in <b  >blk.h</b>. A separate version is compiled into
each block device driver, using special
<b  >#define</b>'d values that are used throughout blk.h
and the block device driver. This brings us to...</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2918580.0x2a11a50"></a>blk.h</h2></div></div><p>We have already seen several macros which are very helpful in
writing block device drivers. Many of these are defined in
<b  >drivers/block/blk.h</b>, and have to be specially
set up.</p><p>At the top of the device driver, after including the standard
include files your driver needs (which must include
<b  >linux/major.h</b> and
<b  >linux/blkdrv.h</b>), you should write the following
lines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define MAJOR_NR FOO_MAJOR
#include "blk.h"
</pre><p>This, in turn, requires that you define
<b  >FOO_MAJOR</b> to be the major number of the device
you are writing in <b  >linux/major.h</b>.
</p><p>Now you need to edit <b  >blk.h</b>. One section of
<b  >blk.h</b>, right near the top, includes definitions
of macros that depend on the definition of
<b  >MAJOR_NR</b>. Add an entry to the end which looks
like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#elif (MAJOR_NR == FOO_MAJOR)
#define DEVICE_NAME "foobar"
#define DEVICE_REQUEST do_foo_request
#define DEVICE_NR(device) (MINOR(device) &gt;&gt; 6)
#define DEVICE_ON(device)
#define DEVICE_OFF(device)
#endif
</pre><p>These are the required macros for each block device driver.
There are more macros that can be defined; they are explained in
the KHG.</p><p><b  >DEVICE_NAME</b> is the name of the driver. The
AT hard drive driver uses the abbreviation &ldquo;hd&rdquo; in most places; for
example, the <b  >request()</b> procedure is called
<b  >do_hd_request()</b>. However, its
<b  >DEVICE_NAME</b> is &ldquo;harddisk&rdquo;. Similarly, the floppy
driver, &ldquo;fd&rdquo;, has a <b  >DEVICE_NAME</b> of &ldquo;floppy&rdquo;.
Other drivers are even more descriptive; read
<b  >blk.h</b> and follow suit.</p><p><b  >DEVICE_REQUEST</b> is the
<b  >request()</b> procedure for the driver.</p><p><b  >DEVICE_NR</b> is used to determine the actual
physical device. For example, the standard AT hard disk driver uses
64 minor devices for each physical device, so
<b  >DEVICE_NR</b> is defined as
(<b  >MINOR(device)&gt;6</b>). The SCSI disk driver uses
16 minor device numbers per physical device, so for it,
<b  >DEVICE_NR</b> is defined as
(<b  >MINOR(device)&gt;4</b>). If you have only one minor
device number per physical device, define
<b  >DEVICE_NR</b> as
(<b  >MINOR(device)</b>).</p><p><b  >DEVICE_ON</b> and
<b  >DEVICE_OFF</b> are only used for devices that have
to be turned on and off. The floppy driver is the only driver that
uses this capability. You will most likely want to define these to
be nothing at all.</p><p>All these macros, as well as many others, can be used in your
driver where appropriate. <b  >blk.h</b> includes a lot
of macros, and studying how they are used in other drivers will
help you use them in your own driver. I won't document them fully
here, but I will briefly mention some of them to make your life
easier.</p><p><b  >DEVICE_INTR</b>, <b  >SET_INTR</b>,
and <b  >CLEAR_INTR</b> make support for interrupt-driven
devices much easier. <b  >DEVICE_ TIMEOUT</b>,
<b  >SET_TIMER</b>, and <b  >CLEAR_TIMER</b>
help you set limits on how long may be taken to satisfy a
request.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2918580.0x2a09308"></a>The First Shall Be the Last</h2></div></div><p>I've saved the first, and perhaps most important, thing for
last. Before you can read or write a single block, the kernel has
to be notified that the device exists. All device drivers are
required to implement an initialization function, and there are
some special requirements for block device drivers. Here is a
sample idealized initialization function:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
long foo_init(long mem_start, int length)
{
  if (register_blkdev(FOO_MAJOR,"foo", &amp; foo_fops)) {
    printk("FOOBAR: Unable to get major %d.\n",
           FOO_MAJOR);
    return 0;
  }
  if (!foo_exists()) {
    /* the foobar device doesn't exist */
    return 0;
  }
  /* initialize hardware if necessary */
  /* notify user device found */
  printk("FOOBAR: Found at address %d.\n",
           foo_addr());
  /* tell buffer cache how to process requests */
  blk_dev[FOO_MAJOR].request_fn = DEVICE_REQUEST;
  /* specify the blocksize */
  blksize_size[MAJOR_NR] = 1024;
  return(size_of_memory_reserved);
}
</pre><p>The three things here that are specific to block device
drivers are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><b  >register_blkdev()</b> registers the
file operations structure with the Virtual Filesystem Switch (VFS),
which is the system that manages access to files.</p></li><li><p><b  >blk_dev</b> tells the buffer cache
where the request procedure is.</p></li><li><p><b  >blksize_size</b> tells the buffer
cache what size blocks to request.</p></li></ul></div><p>It is worth noting that the hardware device detection and
initialization, which I have denoted as
<b  >foo_exists()</b> here, is very delicate code. If you
can rely on a string somewhere in the BIOS of the computer to
determine whether the device exists and where it is, it's
relatively easy. However, if you have to check various I/O ports,
you can hang the computer by writing the wrong value to the wrong
port, <span   class="bold"><b>or even reading the wrong
port</b></span>. Check only well-known ports if you must check
ports, and provide kernel command-line arguments for other ports.
To do this, read <b  >init/main.c</b> and add a section
of your own. If you can't figure out how to do it, an explanation
is forthcoming in the next version of the KHG.</p><p>Of course, none of this initialization will happen if
<b  >foo_init()</b> is never called. Add a prototype to
the top of <b  >blk.h</b> with the other prototypes, and
add a call to <b  >foo_init()</b> in
<b  >ll_rw_blk.c</b> in the
<b  >blk_dev_init()</b> function. That call should be
protected by <b  >#ifdef CONFIG_FOO</b> like the rest of
the <b  >*_init()</b> functions there, and a
corresponding line should be added to the
<b  >config.in</b> file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
bool `Foobar disk support' CONFIG_FOO y
</pre><p><b  >drivers/block/Makefile</b> should have a
section added that looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ifdef CONFIG_FOO
OBJS := $(OBJS) foo.o
SRCS := $(SRCS) foo.c
endif
</pre><p>This done, configuration should work correctly. Your device
driver file does not need to have any references to
<b  >CONFIG_FOO</b>; the only specific reference to it is
commented out in <b  >ll_rw_blk.c</b>, and the makefile
only builds it if it has been configured in.</p><p>Now all you have to do is write and debug your own new block
device driver. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope that this
whirlwind tour has given you a head start.</p><p><a href="2890s1.html" target="_self">Other Resources</a></p></div></div>
