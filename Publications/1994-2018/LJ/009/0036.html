speaking in Belgium, Australia, Singapore, and other places. Could
you describe some of the questions or events you found interesting?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span>: Hmm. I got a
few interesting questions. In Australia, for example, I had two
quite separate persons ask me whether the windows emulator would be
extended to run OS/2 programs as well. I couldn't answer them
(although I think it's very unlikely to be a high priority), but I
found the fact that somebody even asked interesting, as I haven't
seen an OS/2 program.</p><p>Anyway, the most interesting parts of Australia weren't
computers at all, but the small and furry (and sometimes feathered)
animals there. I got bitten by a penguin in Canberra (Killer
Penguins Strike Again), but it was a very small and timid one. And
I naturally saw all the normal Australian animals like wallabies,
koalas, etc.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Were you in a zoo or on
the coast when you were bitten?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: It was at a zoo in
Canberra. The wild fairy penguins seem to be much too shy to
approach at all closely. I don't remember what the island with all
the penguins close to Melbourne was called (might have been Shark
Island), but reportedly people going there just get to see a lot of
penguins; the penguins are so shy that you won't get very
close.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Where did you find the
best beer?</p><p>[Editor's note: This question about beer needs an explanation
for those new to Linux. Linus thanked the &ldquo;Oxford Beer Trolls&rdquo; for
sending him some virtual beer in his release notes. Also, available
on the Internet is a photo of Linus with a beer bottle in front of
him; the photo is captioned &ldquo;Linus Torvalds&mdash;Creator of Linux&rdquo;.
Jokes about virtual beer and virtual breweries have blossomed among
Linux users.]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: The Australian beer
was okay, although I happen to prefer Guinness, not lagers. There
was one interesting stout in Singapore called ABC stout (or
something equally exciting), but I still think I should probably go
to Ireland some day.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Did you hear any good
jokes you could share with us?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I heard one ... but I
don't think that one is suitable for a family magazine like
<i  >LJ</i>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: How has your perception
of the Linux user base changed?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I don't think my
perceptions have changed all that much. The user base is much more
&ldquo;user&rdquo; these days and less &ldquo;hacker&rdquo;, but that's not some revelation
that I got during my trips abroad.</p><p>Some of them make a mean barbecue, and some of them say
&ldquo;G'day mate&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: The last time we talked
via e-mail was last January and much has happened during these past
eight months. What Linux projects are you working on right
now?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Uhh.. Getting ready
for 1.2, I guess. It's already late, but I'd like to have that over
and done with. Various problems there, of course&mdash;mainly the floppy
driver and the TCP problem with the new ciscos.</p><p>And the alpha port. Watch this space, but don't hold your
breath or you'll go blue and mottled in the face.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Those of your
projections fulfilled or close to fulfillment include: i386 SYSV
binary compatibility and windows emulation (halfway there we're
told). What projects or work related to Unix, if any, have you been
surprised to find not yet fulfilled or close to fruition?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Me? Surprised about
projects not fulfilled? You must be joking. I'm more surprised
about the various things that have been fulfilled (the Linux system
itself being one of the things I'm surprised by).</p><p>Of course, there are a few projects that haven't come to
anything yet, but for which I didn't really have high hopes (but
I'd be more than happy to be proven wrong). Like a nice WYSIWYG
word processor (yes, I use LaTeX occasionally, but no, I'm not
crazy enough to think it's the answer).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: We heard you were doing
a 64-bit port for the Alpha. How is this progressing?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Right now I just have
a bootloader and am testing the Alpha console code (essentially the
same as the BIOS on the PC compatibles, but much more complex and
not as well documented). So I have a simple program which boots the
system and explores what's going on (the Alpha is a fun chip, I can
tell you). The port by Jim Paradis is much further along, and even
gets you a shell prompt (but not much else). I'll certainly
leverage on that, but the travels have been limiting my time in
front of the computer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: I heard there were two
efforts going on for Linux being ported to the PowerPC and the Mac,
and that one effort was put on hold because of lack of information
from Apple. Do you think the effort is stalled, or do you know if
there is still real progress being made?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I have no idea on the
PowerPC port. I have only seen the occasional reports (the latest
one indeed saying that they had no knowledge about the IO
interfaces). Apple isn't known for disclosing technical information
and IBM doesn't seem to have any PowerPC machine out yet (except
for the RT which doesn't follow PReP). I don't know what will
happen with the PowerPC (with regard to Linux or anything else for
that matter). I saw a report about IBM now also considering the
Pentium again.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: What is PReP or a PReP
machine?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: PReP stands for
&ldquo;PowerPC Reference Platform&rdquo;--essentially a unified external
interface to the PowerPC chip, defining the external bus and the
BIOS interface. It's an IBM standard, but even IBM doesn't have any
machines out there that follow that standard yet. IBM does have
machines with the PowerPC chipset, but those are in their RT line
of Unix computers, and have their own bus architecture around the
chip (essentially the same one that the POWER series of processors
had which were the predecessors of the PowerPC chip).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Because you know the
kernel better than anyone else, how do you feel about the port? Do
you think it will be an easy port? Do you think it will run as well
on a PowerPC as on the Intel architecture?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Oh, the PowerPC chip
itself shouldn't be the problem. The memory management of the chip
is rather strange (and ugly, imho), but that can be considered an
extended TLB and the PowerPC port could well use the same memory
management architectures, etc., as the current i386 version. The
port should obviously run quite quickly on the chip.</p><p>The surrounding hardware (and thus the device drivers) will
prove to be more problematic unless something comes up (e.g., IBM
finally releases a PReP machine and actually gives enough technical
documentation on it).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: What is TLB?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: TLB: Translation
Lookaside Buffer. It's essentially a small cache inside the
processor that caches the page tables, so that the processor
doesn't need to look up the virtual-physical mapping in the page
tables each time it does a memory access.</p><p>The i386 has a TLB with 18 entries (don't quote me on that,
but it's something of that order), that it uses to cache the
2-level page tables that define the virtual-memory layout. When a
TLB cache miss occurs, the i386 will then (in hardware) look up the
virtual mapping in the page tables, and fill in the TLB.</p><p>The PowerPC uses a slightly different approach&mdash;it won't do a
page table lookup when it misses its TLB. Instead, it will look up
a new TLB entry from a hash table that has been filled in by the
operating system. The operating system can use whatever page table
it wants to generate that hash table.</p><p>As a final example, let's take the Alpha: it has only a TLB
and does any TLB miss lookup in software (the PAL-code). So you can
chose your own way of implementing the page tables. (You could do a
hash-table plus a physical page table like the PowerPC, or you
could go to the page tables directly, like the i386.)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i>:</b></span> When do you think we
will see Linux on PowerPCs?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus:</b></span> I'll pass on that
one. I think both the Alpha and the MIPS ports will be there before
the PowerPC, if only because the hardware and the documentation
already exist.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: What are the new
features you see as needed for Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: The main new feature
needed by the average user would probably be the ability to run
windows binaries; I hope the Wine project really works out. From a
kernel view, the memory management needs some tuning, and the
buffer cache needs to be reorganized to allow indexing by inode and
offset instead of the current device- centered view. And threading
is already something of an issue.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: &ldquo;What's In a Name?&rdquo; Do
you think Linux would have taken off as fast if you'd named the
operating system what you first considered, Freakix? Do you think
someone would have published Freakix Journal?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: Actually, it was just
&ldquo;Freax&rdquo;. And I think Linux turned out to be a much better name,
even though I at first thought it would sound too
egoistical.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Anything else you'd like
to say?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: So this is where you
expect me to do all the interesting revelations, is it? Foiled
again.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Do you have any new
hopes for Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Linus</b></span>: I think my &ldquo;plan&rdquo;
says something like &ldquo;World domination. Fast.&rdquo; But we'll see.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Thanks for the
interview, Linus. We appreciate your taking the time to answer our
questions.</p><p><a href="0036s1.html" target="_self">Live Chat</a></p></div></div>
