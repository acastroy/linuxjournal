if you could start a counter for important and/or interesting
applications&mdash;both commercial and not&mdash;that have been ported to
Linux. A compact layout might include one line per application:
name and a short description of what it does. Also, articles about
windows emulation and WWW are very welcome!
Cheers, &mdash;Veli-Pekka Pulkkinenvpp@vipunen.hut.fi</p><p><i  >LJ</i> responds:</p><p>As far as non-commercial applications, almost everything has
been ported&mdash;far too much to include in a counter in a small
magazine. Most of the commercial apps that have been ported now
advertise in <i  >Linux Journal</i>, so a counter for them would be
redundant.</p><p>Some day, we might be able to provide something like this. We
would need to be a larger magazine (more pages) and have a clearer
vision of what would be listed and what not.</p><p>We will try to keep occasional progress reports about Wine
coming, and we arranged for Bob Amstadt, the head of the Wine
project, to speak last month at the Open Systems World Linux
Conference, as well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b2580.0x28aa3f8"></a>Hacker's OS</h2></div></div><p>I have been running the Slackware Pro 2.0 distribution at
home now for about a month, and I LOVE Linux! It is a fast,
well-thought-out OS. <i  >Linux Journal</i> is
undoubtedly the most useful, well-written magazine I have EVER
subscribed to. I look forward to each new issue and read it many
times. It's great to have a hacker's OS, instead of being forced
into MS-DOS or MS-Windows. &mdash;Stephen E. Farlowsefarlow@crl.com

(issue #4) got me interested in ez, and I think it's great, but I
can't get the equation editor to print equations properly. I'm
using the auis63L1-wp package from sunsite with Slackware 2.0,
including groff 1.09 and ghostscript 3.01 but the equations look
like they have skipped a formatter, and the program won't convert
them to other formats. y=x^2 comes out like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
delim##define above "to" define below "from" define zilch "" define ...
#y=x sup[2]#delim off
</pre><p>How can I fix this?</p><p>Also, the help file mentions a &ldquo;chart&rdquo; program that isn't
included. Where can I find this?  &mdash;David
Jacksonjackson@cfn.cs.dal.ca</p><p>Terry responds:</p><p>In <b  >/usr/andrew/README*</b> it says:&ldquo;If you
print/preview equations, you should modify
/usr/andrew/etc/{atkprint ,atkpreview} so that geqn and gtbl are
invoked. See the comments in [those shell scripts] for more
details.&rdquo;</p><p>Hope this helps. If you have more questions, drop me some
mail.  &mdash;Terry Gliedttpg@mr.net</p><p><i  >LJ</i> responds, too:</p><p>Although this bug is probably fixed in a newer release of
Terry's AUIS packages, I noticed that it exists with the package I
have, as well. Try (as root, or some other user with write
permissions in /usr/ andrew): <b  >cd /usr/andrew/ bin; ln -s
runapp chart</b> which worked for me.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b2580.0x28aaa80"></a>Stop: You're Making Us Blush</h2></div></div><p>I received in the mail today my seventh issue of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. Thank you for providing the
Linux community with such a fine publication. I started running
Linux on a 486DX33 machine just about one year ago. At that time, I
was very new to Unix and Un*x-like operating systems. However, over
the past 12 months, I've installed and configured several Linux
machines, learning more each time than I knew before. I'm now very
comfortable administering my own system, as well as offering advice
to people who are just starting out with an advanced OS.</p><p>Fortunately for me, I subscribed to <i  >LJ</i>
well before the first issue went to press. I say &ldquo;fortunately&rdquo;
because your publication has provided me with timely advice and
guidance. In fact, I am in your debt for publishing such clear,
concise, and pertinent Linux-specific information as that which
appears in Clarence Smith's article, &ldquo;Linux Performance Tuning for
the Faint of Heart&rdquo; (issue #7). Please keep up the good, practical
job you are doing.</p><p>Moreover, it has been a real joy watching
<i  >LJ</i> develop. I'm eager to see where the next 9
issues will take all of us.  &mdash;Louis Dehnerlouis@winter.net.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b2580.0x28aad40"></a>Debugging the Printer</h2></div></div><p>I am a regular reader of this wonderful journal. I would like
to read some articles on printing, specifically, with the following
items: 1) a minimal working printcap for a single machine with a
printer and a client machine of a Linux print server; 2) filters
for text and postscript files; 3) notes on obvious bugs, if any
(for example, when the printer is on everything works fine, but
when the printer is off, the print queue empties as if lpd is
sending the files through the printer port); and 4) where to find
the latest lp stuff.  &mdash;Genaldo L. Nunesnunes@mtm.ufsc.br</p><p><i  >LJ</i> responds:</p><p>We have an author who is currently writing an article on
printing, although we haven't scheduled it for print yet.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b2580.0x28aaf50"></a>Correction</h2></div></div><p>In the December issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>,
the address of Linux International was given as info@li.org.au.
This has now been changed to info@li.org.</p></div></div>
