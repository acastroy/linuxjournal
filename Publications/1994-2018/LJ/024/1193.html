data</b></span>, n. 1. Data that is written to be interpreted and
takes over program flow when triggered by some un-obvious
operation, such as viewing it. One use of such hacks is to break
security. For example, some smart terminals have commands that
allow one to download strings to program keys; this can be used to
write live data that, when listed to the terminal, infects it with
a security-breaking <span   class="emphasis"><em>virus</em></span> that is triggered
the next time a hapless user strikes that key. For another, there
are some well-known bugs in <span   class="emphasis"><em>vi</em></span> that allow
certain texts to send arbitrary commands back to the machine when
they are simply viewed. 2. In C code, data that includes pointers
to function <span   class="emphasis"><em>hook</em></span>s (executable code). 3. An
object, such as a <span   class="emphasis"><em>trampoline</em></span>, that is
constructed on the fly by a program and intended to be executed as
code. --From the Jargon file, version 3.2.0

Crusty the Clown fans should click <span   class="bold"><b>here</b></span>!!!
</pre><p>Perhaps I was a bit naive&mdash;or just stupid. But I clicked on
the damned link. The actual transfer didn't take very long, and
pageview (Sun's PostScript viewer) quickly brought up a picture of
Crusty the Clown (from The Simpsons). The first inkling of any
trouble was that my disk drive light came on. And stayed on. That
almost never happens, especially without me doing something. I
pulled up another xterm. Something was really funny; my tcsh
configuration was all wrong...</p><p>My drive light went off. My home directory was gone.</p><p>Some fancy footwork with my sysadmin got my home directory
back (fortunately it had been backed up the night before). Since
the catastrophe happened early in the morning, nothing except the
previous evening's e-mail was lost.</p><p>I was damned lucky.</p><p>All that had happened was that someone had embedded a command
line in the PostScript image. The PostScript viewer I was using
happily executed the command and 200 megabytes of my files were
simply erased.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de9580.0x1ee1ad8"></a>More Live Data</h2></div></div><p>As the Internet becomes more and more sophisticated, rich and
complex schemes of data interpretation become more common. Each of
these schemes is a potential security hole. Conventional security
mechanisms are less than effective at dealing with these
problems.</p><p>The breadth of use of live data makes finding an effective
solution quite hard. Users are demanding the newer, richer Internet
services and site administrators cannot delay adding such services
for very long. The widespread deployment of web browsers and MIME
e-mail involves fairly substantial security risks which have many
unintended consequences.</p><p>The (true) nightmare story introducing this article is a good
example. Most PostScript viewers have a secure mode which disables
the file writing and program-launching operations that are part of
the PostScript language. However, my local configuration did not
use the secure mode and I got burned by someone's idea of humor.
Problems with embedded PostScript are well-known, however. Other
tools which (at first) seem innocuous may also have potential
problems.</p><p>The infamous Internet Worm of 1987 used a simple
buffer-overrun bug in the finger daemon to compromise security on a
great many computers. Historically, a great many C programs have
had similar flaws&mdash;maybe not as dangerous to security as the finger
bug, but often quite catastrophic in their own right.</p><p><a href="1193s1.html" target="_self">Buffer-overrun Bugs
sidebar</a></p><p>Consider the current state-of-the-art in web browsers. The
vast majority of the web browsers currently on the market share a
common ancestry with NCSA's Mosaic. Given the intense market
pressures to bring web clients to market in today's Internet
feeding frenzy and greased-pig-catching contest, it seems unlikely
that extreme care has been taken in ensuring that web browsers
securely interpret HTML. Buffer overflow problems (which seem
particularly likely in anchors) could give unscrupulous individuals
a way to execute any arbitrary code sequence on target
machines.</p><p>This problem is only getting worse. The Java language is
currently exploding through the Internet world, and it seems likely
that there will be a great many surprises associated with Java.
Even though Java is intended to provide security mechanisms to
prevent abuse, all it takes is one flaw to cause a major
problem.</p><p>Another example of live data (which few people have
considered) is the local variables list in Emacs. This is a highly
convenient feature, as it allows per-file customization for the
Emacs editor. For example, programmers can code their bracing and
indentation preferences into the file, so other emacs users who
edited the file are automatically able to follow those same bracing
conventions. However, since many of the local &ldquo;variables&rdquo; are
typically Emacs Lisp functions, there could be a substantial risk
associated with merely viewing a file in Emacs&mdash;the same risks
associated with viewing PostScript files with an unsafe
viewer.</p><p>The Emacs problem is fairly manageable. If you set the
variable <b  >enable-local-variables</b> to
<b  >nil</b>, this feature of Emacs is disabled.</p><p>It seems that the biggest risks are associated with the most
complex services. MIME e-mail provides a mechanism for launching
viewer programs based on the contents of the e-mail. So, if you
send a JPEG picture, a JPEG viewer will be launched. Thus, a very
large (and rapidly expanding) set of programs can be involved&mdash;too
many to ensure reasonable security. Some MIME configurations even
allow the transmission and execution of shell scripts or Perl
programs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de9580.0x1ee2000"></a>Some Non-Solutions</h2></div></div><p>The cheapest, most reliable, and most secure components of
any system are the ones that aren't there. Is it possible to solve
the live data problem by avoiding the use of the advanced tools
that pose the threat?</p><p>It probably isn't practical for a site administrator to
outlaw such tools. For one thing, they are all too useful, and one
has to weigh a possibly substantial security risk against a threat
to an organization's competitiveness. In addition, it is unlikely
that any but the most draconian site administrators could prevent
users from acquiring their own personal web browsers or MIME e-mail
clients. Fascist site administration might make matters worse,
since the individuals who were using the outlawed tools would
obviously not be informing site security staff of what they were
doing.</p><p>Internet firewalls are becoming a popular security mechanism.
However, it doesn't seem likely that they can protect against
hostile live data. They could completely block risky services (like
e-mail and the Web), but if you completely block those services
there isn't much point to being on the Internet. It also does not
seem practical for a firewall to inspect all data coming from the
net and looking for &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; activities. For one thing, we
don't have a good mechanism for distinguishing &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; live
data from &ldquo;unfriendly&rdquo; live data&mdash;and the most dangerous live
data doesn't look live at all. Another point to think about is that
the effort involved in trying to solve this problem will likely put
an unacceptable performance burden on the firewall.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1de9580.0x1ee21b8"></a>Some Possible Solutions</h2></div></div><p>There does not seem to be any &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; solution to
this problem. However, there are some fairly simple steps that can
be taken to provide reasonable protection:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If possible, run your web browser and perform other
possibly risky activities (e.g. viewing PostScript files, running
programs you have downloaded) as another user ID that you use
expressly for that purpose. This makes it less likely that major
damage to your personal files or your system could occur.</p></li><li><p>Save your &ldquo;dot files&rdquo; frequently. It may also
help to allow only read-only access to such files. Dot files (such
as your .profile, .emacs, .exrc, or .rhosts files) are frequent
targets of live-data attacks.</p></li><li><p>Probably the best advice is to be a little bit
paranoid. If you get a large MIME attachment that appears to be a
shell script, treat it the same way you would treat an armed
bomb.</p></li></ul></div><p>The best advice is not to avoid tools which use live data,
but rather to use them very carefully. Being aware of the risks is
probably the best defense. So have fun, and be careful out
there.</p></div></div>
