    There is a treasure trove of software for Linux just waiting
    for you to download it from the Internet or copy it from a
    CD-ROM. However, you may need to keep an open mind to
    recognize a treasure when you see it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2189580.0x22813f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the most popular questions asked
throughout the comp.os.linux Usenet hierarchy is &ldquo;Where can I find
a program to do <span   class="emphasis"><em>insert your favorite task
here</em></span>?&rdquo; About half of these questions result in a
three-month thread concerning the merits of WYSIWIG versus markup
style text editing while the other half slide into obscurity
without any answers at all.
</p><p>Finding software for Linux on the Internet is pretty easy,
but there are three principles about free software you should
accept before you start looking:</p><p>1) Something close to what you want exists. There are
thousands of gigabytes of anonymous ftp space on the Internet and
one of them will contain something that you'll consider useful&mdash;if
you ever find it.</p><p>2) Whatever you find won't do everything you need. Most of
the free programs you'll soon be wading through were written by one
or two programmers whose needs are fully met by the programs they
wrote.</p><p>3) Whatever you find will do more then you need. Unix
software tends to accumulate obscure features at an astonishing
rate.</p><p>Everyone's annual pilgrimage for an X-based Ami Pro clone
illustrates these principles. While GUI-based, somewhat WYSIWIG
word processing techniques for Linux do exist, none of them (ez,
idoc, TeX/LaTeX/xdvi/gs combination, or a groff/gs combination)
will do exactly what you had in mind. Then again, you can balance
your checkbook in the middle of ez and and use TeX to get every
other character to print upside down.</p><p>The first place to look for Linux software is the Linux
Software Map (LSM), maintained by Lars Wirzenius
(<a href="mailto:lars.wirzenius@helsinki.fi">lars.wirzenius@helsinki.fi</a>
). It's a collection of lsm entries which are supplied by people
who submit files to the primary Linux archives (sunsite.unc.edu and
tsx-11.mit.edu). The LSM includes descriptions of packages and full
path names to where packages can be found on those two
sites.</p><p>The easiest way to search the LSM is via the World Wide Web.
A number of Web search engines are available, such as
<a href="http://siva.cshl.org/lsm/lsm.html" target="_self">siva.cshl.org/lsm/lsm.html</a>.
This site provides searching via a searchable index, which is
supported by most web browsers. Another web search engine is
available at
<a href="http://harvest.cs.colorado.edu/brokers/lsm/query.html" target="_self">harvest.cs.colorado.edu/brokers/lsm/query.html</a>.
This interface is based on forms, and not all browsers support it
(though lynx, Mosaic, and Netscape all do). When a match is found,
hypertext links enable the user to download the files that matched
without leaving the browser.</p><p>If you don't have Web access (or if you just like doing
things on the command line) you can ftp the latest LSM as one large
text file from sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/docs/LSM.gz. A few
Linux-based tools to make searching this file easier are available
for ftp from sunsite.unc.edu in the directory
/pub/Linux/search.</p><p>Each package in the LSM has description and keyword fields
which provide an excellent basis for searching. Looking for &ldquo;sound
mixer&rdquo; via the colorado web site found 15 matches, showing how
effective searching the LSM can be.</p><p>However, the LSM quickly gets out of date. The filenames and
version numbers in it are often wrong, so don't think you're
finished. The site names, directory paths, and package names can be
used to find the software you're looking for even if the specific
filename is wrong. Use ftp to connect to the site and cd to the
directory the LSM mentions, and you'll probably find a few
different packages that meet your needs.</p><p>If searching the LSM fails to find what you need, look at the
sunsite.unc.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu ftp sites. Both of those sites
have large Linux directory trees (in /pub/Linux and /pub/linux
respectively) with both binaries and sources. Most CD-ROM
distributors of Linux include a CD-ROM of one or both sites which
provide a fast alternative to ftp.</p><p>Sunsite provides a file that is especially handy for finding
software&mdash;/pub/Linux/INDEX.whole.gz. It contains all of sunsite's
text INDEX files concatenated together, meaning it has a
description of almost all of the files in sunsite's Linux
directory. Searching this file for keywords with grep or a text
editor lets you skim all of sunsite's 2 gigabytes very quickly.
Looking for the word &ldquo;mixer&rdquo; in this file found 10 lines that
mention the word, one of which is the name of a directory full of
audio mixers! If sunsite has what you're looking for, this method
is sure to find it.</p><p>Tsx-11.mit.edu's archive doesn't have as nice a way of
searching it. It provides two files, ls-lR and find-ls.gz that list
all of the files in the system. If you know (or can guess) the name
of the file you want, these files will help you find it.</p><p>If none of these techniques help, it's time to look outside
of the Linux world. I've found that the Usenet FAQs provide an
excellent source of information about free software. The
comp.compilers FAQ has an extensive list of free language tools,
including compilers and interpretors. Likewise, the
rec.sport.football FAQ tells of an ftp site (ftp.vnet.com) that
contains software for football fans and the comp.db FAQ has a large
list of free database packages.</p><p>The hardest part about finding an FAQ is finding the name of
a newsgroup it's been posted to. If your newsreader lets you search
for newsgroups via a regular expression, that's the best way. Both
rn and trn let you do this with the &ldquo;a&rdquo; command at the newsgroup
selection level. Typing &ldquo;a&rdquo; followed by a regular expression
returns the names of all newsgroups you have access to which
satisfy that expression. For example, to look for newsgroups
related to computer sound &ldquo;a comp.*sound&rdquo; (which returns 6
matches) would be a good way to start. If you're not familiar with
regular expressions the GNU grep man page provides a good
introduction, as did the introduction to grep in <i  >Linux Journal</i> issue 18. If your newsreader doesn't let you
search for newsgroups, try grepping the .newsrc file in your home
directory (if you have one).</p><p>Once you get the name of the newsgroup whose FAQ you'd like
to peruse, the rest is easy. The site rtfm.mit.edu collects all of
the FAQs that are posted to the net and automatically updates them
as new versions are released. This site is very busy and supplies a
list of mirrors if you can't log in anonymously.</p><p>The directory /pub/usenet contains a directory for each
newsgroup which has one or more FAQs. Those directories contain the
FAQs themselves.</p><p>If you couldn't find the name of a newsgroup that might be
helpful, all is not lost. Rtfm has a separate FAQ directory tree
identical to Usenet's hierarchy. If you ftp in and cd to
/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy you get a directory with a subdirectory
for each top level news domain (such as comp, alt, rec and talk).
Those subdirectories contain further subdirectories. For example,
the newsgroup comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard.misc would have it's FAQ
stored in the directory
/pub/usenet-by-hierarchy/comp/sys/ibm/pc/soundcard/misc on
rtfm.mit.edu.</p><p>Another resource for finding programs is the comp.archives
newsgroup. It contains regular postings from a variety of archive
sites detailing their contents. Reading through those posts or
searching though it's archives (such as the one at
ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/usenet/comp.archives) can help narrow
down the sites to wade through.</p><p>The final choice (and the hardest to use) is the archie
search service. While archie was designed for ftp searches it is an
old service, and fairly hard to use. The various archie databases
on the net each contain file lists from about 1200 ftp sites
throughout the world, providing a total of around 2.5 million
unique filenames that may be searched (the whole database is
currently around 400MB). If a file can be ftped from the net,
archie knows about it.</p><p>The World Wide Web provides the easiest way to conduct archie
searches. A huge list of archie gateways on the web is available at
<a href="http://web.nexor.co.uk/archie.html" target="_self">web.nexor.co.uk/archie.html</a>.
While many of them support forms-based browsers, most also provide
searchable indexes.</p><p>Several direct archie search clients are also available from
archie.mcgill.ca in the /pub/archie-clients directory and come with
some Linux distributions. They allow searching from either the
command line or via a X search engine.</p><p>Finally, there are several telnet interfaces to archie
databases. For example, telnetting to archie.mcgill.ca provides an
interactive archie search session. While it can be somewhat
cryptic, typing &ldquo;help&rdquo; should help you figure it out.</p><p>When you're searching archie it is important to remember that
it just indexed file paths. If you know the file name you're
looking for this isn't a problem, otherwise you have to guess what
a likely name is.</p><p>You'll find that when you search on a term that finds
matches, the matches will come in a flood. Using one of the archie
WWW interfaces to search for &ldquo;mixer&rdquo; as a substring found 95
matches, which is what I had the match limit set to. All of the
sites it found were in Europe, suggesting that archie hadn't begun
to search any of the other continents yet!</p><p>The final thing to know about archie is that it can be very
slow. It is an extremely popular way of searching the net due to
the sheer volume of information it contains and the load on it
results in search times of many minutes even at odd times of the
night.</p><p>The Linux Software Map, the primary linux ftp sites, Usenet
FAQs, comp.archives, and archie all provide useful ways of finding
freely available Linux software on the net.</p></div></div>
