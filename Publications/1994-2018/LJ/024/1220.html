    This article, the second of five, introduces part of the
    actual code to create custom module implementing a character
    device driver. It describes the code for module
    initialization and cleanup, as well as the open and close
    system calls.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1597580.0x168f558"></a></h2></div></div><p>The last issues <span   class="emphasis"><em>Kernel
Korner</em></span> introduced problems related to loading and
unloading a custom module, but didn't uncover the code to actually
perform these tasks. This time, we are going to look at some finer
details of module-writing, in order to begin showing the actual
code for our character device driver.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1597580.0x168f6b8"></a>Load-time Configuration</h2></div></div><p>Although a smart driver should be able to autodetect the
hardware it looks for, autodetection is not always the most
sensible implementation, because it may be tricky to design. It is
wise to provide a way to specify as many details as possible at
load time, in order to test your driver before scratching your head
and deciding to implement autodetection. Moreover, autodetection
may fail if &ldquo;similar&rdquo; hardware is installed in the computer. A
minor project can simply avoid autodetection altogether.</p><p>To configure the driver at load time, we'll exploit insmod's
capability to assign integer values to arbitrary variables in the
driver. We'll thus declare a (public) integer variable for each
configurable item, and we'll make sure that the default value will
trigger autodetection.</p><p>Configuring multiple boards at load time is left as an
exercise to the reader (after reading the manpage for
<b  >insmod</b>); this implementation allows
specification of a single board: for the sake of simplicity
additional boards are only reachable through autodetection.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1597580.0x168f8c8"></a>Choosing Names</h2></div></div><p>The kernel is a complex application, and it is vital to keep
its namespace as tidy as possible. This means both to use private
symbols wherever it is possible, and to use a common prefix for all
the symbols you define.</p><p>A production environment will only declare
<b  >init_module()</b> and
<b  >cleanup_module()</b>, which are used to load and
unload the driver, and any load-time configuration variables.
Nothing else needs to be public, because the module is accessed
through pointers, not by name.</p><p>However, when you are developing and testing your code,
you'll need your functions and data structures in the public symbol
table in order to access them with your favorite debugging
tool.</p><p>The easiest way to accomplish this dual need is to always use
your own prefix in names, declare all of your symbols
<b  >Static</b> (note the capital `S'), and include the
following five lines at the top of your driver:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#ifdef DEBUG_<span   class="emphasis"><em>modulename</em></span>
# define Static /* nothing */
#else
# define Static static
#endif
</pre><p>Real static symbols (such as persistent local variables) may
thus be declared <b  >static</b>, while debuggable
symbols are declared <b  >Static</b></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1597580.0x168fd98"></a>The <b  >init_module()</b>
Function</h2></div></div><p>In this page, the whole code for the initialization function
is uncovered. This is skeletal code, as the <b  >skel</b>
name suggests: a real-world device usually has slightly more than
two I/O ports.</p><p>The most important thing to remember here is to release all
the resources you already asked for whenever you find an error
condition. This kind of task is well handled by the (otherwise
unloved) <b  >goto</b> statement: code duplication is
avoided by jumping to the resource-release part of the function in
case of error.</p><p>The fragment of code shown accepts load-time configuration
for the major number, for the base address of the board's I/O
ports, and for the IRQ number. For each &ldquo;possible&rdquo; board (in the
I/O space), the autodetection function is called. If no boards are
detected, <b  >init_module()</b> returns
<b  >-ENODEV</b> to tell insmod that no devices are
there.</p><p>Sometimes it is wise to allow the driver to be loaded even if
its hardware is not installed in the computer. I implement such
code in order to develop most of my driver at home. The trick is to
have a configuration variable (<b  >skel_fake</b>) which
allows you to fake a nonexistent board. You can look at the
implementation in my own drivers. &ldquo;Faking boards&rdquo; is a powerful
way to start writing code before you get the hardware, or to test
support for two boards even if you only own one of them.</p><p>The role of <b  >cleanup_module()</b> is to shut
down the device and release any resources allocated by
<b  >init_module()</b>. Our sample code cycles through
the array of boards and releases I/O ports and the IRQ, if any.
Finally, the major number is released. The initial check for
<b  >MOD_IN_USE</b> is redundant if you're running a
recent kernel, but a wise thing to put in production code, because
your customers or users may be running old Linux kernels.</p><p>The sample code for <b  >init_module()</b> and
<b  >cleanup_module()</b> is shown in
<a href="1220l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a>. The prefix
<b  >skel_</b> is used for all non-local names. The code
here is quite simplified, in that it lacks some error-checking,
which is vital in production-quality source code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1597580.0x16904d0"></a>Autodetecting the Device</h2></div></div><p><b  >init_module()</b> calls the function
<b  >skel_find()</b> to perform the dirty task of
detecting if a board is there. The function is very device
specific, because each device must be probed for its peculiar
features; thus, I won't try to show code to perform the actual
probing, but only IRQ autodetection.</p><p>Unfortunately, some peripherals can't tell which IRQ line
they're configured to use, thus forcing the user to write the IRQ
number on the command line of insmod, or to hardcode the number in
the software itself. Both these approaches are bad practice,
because you just can't plug the board (after setting the jumpers)
and load the driver. The only way to autodetect the IRQ line for
these devices is a trial-and-error technique, which is, of course,
only viable if the hardware can be instructed to generate
interrupts.</p><p>The code in <a href="1220l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a> shows
<b  >skel_find()</b>, complete with IRQ autodetection.
Some details of IRQ handling may appear obscure to some readers,
but they will be clarified in the next article. To summarize, this
code cycles through each of the possible IRQ lines, asking to
install a handler, and looks to see if interrupts are actually
generated by the board.</p><p>The field <b  >hwirq</b> in the hardware structure
represents the <span   class="emphasis"><em>useable</em></span> interrupt line, while
the field <b  >irq</b> is only valid when the line is
active (after <b  >request_irq()</b>). As explained in
the last issue, it makes no sense to keep hold of an IRQ line when
the device is not in use; that's why two fields are used.</p><p>Please note that I wrote this code as a work-around for the
limitations of one of my hardware boards; if your hardware is able
to report the IRQ line it's going to use, it's much better to use
<span   class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> information instead. The code is quite
stable, anyway, if you are able to tailor it to your actual
hardware. Fortunately, most good hardware is able to report its own
configuration.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1597580.0x1690a50"></a><b  >fops</b> and
<b  >filp</b></h2></div></div><p>After the module has been loaded and the hardware has been
detected, we must see <span   class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> the device is acted
upon. This means introducing the role of <b  >fops</b>
and <b  >filp</b>: these little beasts are the most
important data structures&mdash;actually, variable names&mdash;used in
interfacing the device driver with the kernel.</p><p><b  >fops</b> is the name usually devoted to a
<b  >struct file_operations</b>. The structure is a
<span   class="bold"><b>jump table</b></span> (structure of pointers
to functions), and each field refers to one of the different
operations performed on a filesystem node
(<b  >open()</b>, <b  >read()</b>,
<b  >ioctl()</b>, etc.).</p><p>A pointer to your own <b  >fops</b> is passed to
the kernel by means of <b  >register_chrdev()</b>, so
that your functions will be called whenever one of your nodes is
acted upon. We already wrote that line of code, but didn't show the
actual <b  >fops</b>. Here it is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
struct file_operations skel_fops {
  skel_lseek,
  skel_read,
  skel_write,
  NULL,       /* skel_readdir */
  skel_select,
  skel_ioctl,
  skel_mmap,
  skel_open,
  skel_close
};
</pre><p>Each <b  >NULL</b> entry in your fops means that
you're not going to offer that functionality for your device
(<b  >select</b> is special, in this respect, but I won't
expand on it), each non-<b  >NULL</b> entry must be a
pointer to a function implementing the operation for your device.
Actually, there exist a few more fields in the structure, but our
example will live with the default <b  >NULL</b> value
(the C compiler fills up an incomplete structure with zero bytes
without issuing any warning). If you are really interested in them,
you can look at the structure's definition in
<b  >&lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</b>. <b  >filp</b> is
the name usually devoted to one of the arguments passed by the
kernel to any function in your fops, namely a <b  >struct file
*</b>. The <b  >file</b> structure is used to keep
all the available status information about an &ldquo;open file&rdquo;,
beginning with a call to <b  >open()</b> and up to a call
to <b  >close()</b>. If the device is opened multiple
times, different <b  >filp</b>s will be used for each
instance: this means that you'll need to use your own data
structure to keep hardware information about your devices. The code
fragments within this installment already use an array of
<b  >Skel_Hw</b>, to hold information about several
boards installed on the same computer. What is missing, then, is a
way to embed hardware information in the <b  >file</b>
structure, in order to instruct the driver to operate on the right
device. The field <b  >private_data</b> exists in
<b  >struct file</b> just for that task, and is a pointer
to <b  >void</b>. You'll make
<b  >private_data</b> point to your hardware information
structure when <b  >skel_open()</b> gets invoked. If you
need to keep some extra information private to each filp (for
example, if two device nodes access the same hardware in two
different ways), then you'll need a specific structure for
<b  >private_data</b>, which must be
<b  >kmalloc()</b>ed on open and
<b  >kfree()</b>ed on close. The implementations of
open() and close() that we'll see later, work in this way.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1597580.0x1688150"></a>Using Minor Numbers</h2></div></div><p>In the last article I introduced the idea of minor device
numbers, and it is now high time to expand on the topic.</p><p>If your driver manages multiple devices, or a single device
but in different ways, you'll create several nodes in the
<b  >/dev</b> directory, each with a different minor
number. When your open function gets invoked, then, you can examine
the minor number of the node being opened, and take appropriate
actions.</p><p>The prototypes of your open and close functions are</p><pre     class="programlisting">
int skel_open (struct inode *inode,
               struct file *filp);
void skel_close (struct inode *inode,
                 struct file *filp);
</pre><p>and the minor number (an unsigned value, currently 8 bits) is
available as <b  >MINOR(inode-&gt;i_rdev)</b>. The
<b  >MINOR</b> macro and the relevant structures are
defined within <b  >&lt;linux/fs.h&gt;</b>, which in turn
is included in <b  >&lt;linux/sched.h&gt;</b>.</p><p>Our skel code (<a href="1220l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>)
will split the minor number in order to manage both multiple boards
(using four bits of the minor), and multiple modes (using the
remaining four bits). To keep things simple we'll only write code
for two boards and two modes. The following macros are used:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define SKEL_BOARD(dev) (MINOR(dev)&amp;0x0F)
#define SKEL_MODE(dev)  ((MINOR(dev)&gt;&gt;4)&amp;0x0F)
</pre><p>The nodes will be created with the following commands (within
the <b  >skel_load</b> script, see last month's
article):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mknod skel0    c $major  0
mknod skel0raw c $major  1
mknod skel1    c $major 16
mknod skel1raw c $major 17
</pre><p>But let's turn back to the code. This
<b  >skel_open()</b> sorts out the minor number and folds
any relevant information inside the filp, in order to avoid further
overhead when read() or write() will be invoked. This goal is
achieved by using a <b  >Skel_Clientdata</b> structure
embedding any filp-specific information, and by changing the
pointer to your <b  >fops</b> within the
<b  >filp</b>; namely,
<b  >filp-&gt;f_op</b>.</p><p>Changing values within <b  >filp</b> may appear a
bad practice, and it often is; it is, however, a smart idea when
the file operations are concerned. The <b  >f_op</b>
field points to a static object anyways, so you can modify it
lightheartedly, as long as it points to a valid structure; any
subsequent operation on the file will be dispatched using the new
jump table, thus avoiding a lot of conditionals. This technique is
used within the kernel proper to implement the different
memory-oriented devices using a single major device number.</p><p>The complete skeletal code for <b  >open()</b> and
<b  >close()</b> is shown in
<a href="1220l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a>; the
<b  >flags</b> field in the clientdata will be used when
<b  >ioctl()</b> is introduced.</p><p>Note that the <b  >close()</b> function shown here
should be referred to by both <b  >fops</b>s. If
different <b  >close()</b> implementations are needed,
this code must be duplicated.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1597580.0x1688e08"></a>Multiple- or Single-open?</h2></div></div><p>A device driver should be a policy-free program, because
policy choices are best suited to the application. Actually, the
habit of separating policy and mechanism is one of the strong
points of Unix. Unfortunately, the implementation of
<b  >skel_open()</b> leads itself to policy issues: is it
correct to allow multiple concurrent opens? If yes, how can I
handle concurrent access in the driver?</p><p>Both single-open and multiple-open have sound advantages. The
code shown for <b  >skel_open()</b> implements a third
solution, somewhat in-between.</p><p>If you choose to implement a single-open device, you'll
greatly simplify your code. There's no need for dynamic structures
because a static one will suffice; thus, there's no risk to have
memory leakage because of your driver. In addition, you can
simplify your <b  >select()</b> and data-gathering
implementation because you're always sure that a single process is
collecting your data. A single-open device uses a boolean variable
to know if it is busy, and returns <b  >-EBUSY</b> when
open is called the second time. You can see this simplified code in
the busmouse drivers and lp driver within the kernel proper.</p><p>A multiple-open device, on the other hand, is slightly more
difficult to implement, but much more powerful to use for the
application writer. For example, debugging your applications is
simplified by the possibility of keeping a monitor constantly
running on the device, without the need to fold it in the
application proper. Similarly, you can modify the behaviour of your
device while the application is running, and use several simple
scripts as your development tools, instead of a complex catch-all
program. Since distributed computation is common nowadays, if you
allow your device to be opened several times, you are ready to
support a cluster of cooperating processes using your device as an
input or output peripheral.</p><p>The disadvantages of using a conventional multiple-open
implementation are mainly in the increased complexity of the code.
In addition to the need for dynamic structures (like the
<b  >private_data</b> already shown), you'll face the
tricky points of a true stream-like implementation, together with
buffer management and blocking and non-blocking read and write; but
those topics will be delayed until next month's column.</p><p>At the user level, a disadvantage of multiple-open is the
possibility of interference between two non-cooperating processes:
this is similar to cat-ing a tty from another tty&mdash;input may be
delivered to the shell or to cat, and you can't tell in advance.
[For a demonstration of this, try this: start two xterms or log
into two virtual consoles. On one (A), run the
<span   class="bold"><b>tty</b></span> command, which tells you which
tty is in use. On the other (B), type <b  >cat
/dev/<i><tt>tty_of_A</tt></i></b>. Now go to A and
type normally. Depending on several things, including which shell
you use, it may work fine. However, if you run
<span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>, you will probably see what you
type coming out on B, and you will have to type
<b  >^C</b> on B to be able to recover your session on
A&mdash;ED]</p><p>A multiple-open device can be accessed by several different
users, but often you won't want to allow different users to access
the device concurrently. A solution to this problem is to look at
the <b  >uid</b> of the first process opening the device,
and allow further opens only to the same user or to root. This is
not implemented in the skel code, but it's as simple as checking
<b  >current-&gt;euid</b>, and returning
<b  >-EBUSY</b> in case of mismatch. As you see, this
policy is similar to the one used for ttys: login changes the owner
of ttys to the user that has just logged in.</p><p>The <b  >skel</b> implementation shown here is a
multiple-open one, with a minor addition: it assures that the
device is &ldquo;brand new&rdquo; when it is first opened, and it shuts the
device down when it is last closed.</p><p>This implementation is particularly useful for those devices
which are accessed quite rarely: if the frame grabber is used once
a day, I don't want to inherit strange setting from the last time
it was used. Similarly, I don't want to wear it out by continuously
grabbing frames that nobody is going to use. On the other hand,
startup and shutdown are lengthy tasks, especially if the IRQ has
to be detected, so you might not choose this policy for your own
driver. The field <b  >usecount</b> within the hardware
structure is used to turn on the device at the first open, and to
turn it off on the last close. The same policy is devoted to the
IRQ line: when the device is not being used, the interrupt is
available to other devices (if they share this friendly
behaviour).</p><p>The disadvantages of this implementation are the overhead of
the power cycles on the device (which may be lengthy) and the
inability to configure the device with one program in order to use
it with another program. If you need a persistent state in the
device, or want to avoid the power cycles, you can simply keep the
device open by means of a command as silly as this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
sleep 1000000 &lt; /dev/skel0 &amp;
</pre><p>As it should be clear from the above discussion, each
possible implementation of the <b  >open()</b> and
<b  >close()</b> semantics has its own peculiarities, and
the choice of the optimum one depends on your particular device and
the main use it is devoted to. Development time may be considered
as well, unless the project is a major one. The
<b  >skel</b> implementation here may not be the best for
your driver: it is only meant as a sample case, one amongst several
different possibilities. <a href="1220s1.html" target="_self">Additional
