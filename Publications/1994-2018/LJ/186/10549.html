The <span   class="bold"><b>state government of New York</b></span> is using
<span   class="bold"><b>git</b></span>! The <a href="http://github.com/nysenatecio" target="_self">github.com/nysenatecio</a> site
hosts GPLed tools launched by the New York State Senate, including
<a href="http://open.nysenate.gov/openleg" target="_self">open.nysenate.gov/openleg</a>, which lets users search through ongoing
legislative activities. The project seems very kernel-centric, even
using a MAINTAINERS file similar to that of the Linux kernel. The data
at the back end of these tools also is freely available, so people can
write their own front-end sites or contribute to the state's effort.
Neat!
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>Xen developers</b></span> are tasting the bitter pill of rejection. Many Xen
users see a real need for Xen to be accepted into the kernel in the
immediate future, but the kernel folks are holding out due to various
problems. First, the Xen code is very invasive and apparently is not
very respectful of the areas of the kernel it touches. As <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> puts it, &ldquo;Xen craps all over other people's
code&rdquo;, and
elsewhere, he said, &ldquo;Xen pollutes the architecture code in ways that no
other subsystem does.&rdquo; There also are certain features of Xen that
people such as <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> feel are badly implemented, to the point that
they would create long-term maintenance and debugging problems for the
kernel, which could not simply be backed out when better solutions
arose.
</p><p>
The issues standing in the way of Xen inclusion in the Linux kernel,
therefore, are all messy, difficult issues that would require the Xen
Project in some ways to come to a screeching halt and move off in a
different direction. The Xen developers currently are of a single
voice in resisting this, but there's really no alternative. Their best
bet probably is to submit small, sensible patches that make the kernel
more and more naturally able to support Xen features. Alan Cox,
<span   class="bold"><b>Theodore Y. Ts'o</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo Molnar</b></span> and others have expressed an interest in
helping the Xen developers identify how best to direct their energies
toward getting code into the kernel. But, just hoping that one day
Linus decides Xen is too important to keep out of the kernel is
traditionally a losing strategy.
</p><p>
Once a crucial driver and the topic of endless horrifying flame wars,
the <span   class="bold"><b>IDE code</b></span> is changing hands yet
again, from <span   class="bold"><b>Bartlomiej
Zolnierkiewicz</b></span> to <span   class="bold"><b>David S.
Miller</b></span>, who says he will consider IDE to be
&ldquo;legacy code&rdquo;. IDE is, in fact, gradually being obsoleted by
the <span   class="bold"><b>PATA
drivers</b></span>, but there still are plenty of users tied to the IDE code, and
so bug fixes and other enhancements will continue to be important for
some time to come. The <span   class="bold"><b>linux-next tree</b></span>
already has switched from using
Bart's tree to David's, maintained at
<a href="http://master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/ide-2.6.git" target="_self">master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/ide-2.6.git</a>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Guo Hongruan</b></span> announced that he'd successfully gotten Linux compiled
and running on the <span   class="bold"><b>TriMedia
microprocessor</b></span>, used typically for audio
and video processing. TriMedia has no GCC target, making the port a
difficult one. Guo had to run the kernel through a preprocessor to
translate all the special GCC extensions into standard C99 source
code, after which it compiled under the tmcc compiler. His work is
available at <a href="http://tmlinux.googlecode.com" target="_self">tmlinux.googlecode.com</a>.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jon Masters</b></span> has started a podcast of the

providing semi-daily summaries of events. He was inspired by the
desire to force himself to keep up with the mailing list. Audio is

<h2 class="title">Is Telnet Really the Root of All Evil?</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #186, October 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
For quite some time, security experts have been
claiming that Telnet is one of the worst protocols out there, and that it should
be eradicated from the earth. According to these so-called experts, no one
should use anything but SSH. Well, I'm here to show you that they are
completely wrong. Telnet is one of the greatest gifts to humans.
</p><p>
The above paragraph should ensure some rabid e-mail messages. For those of
you still reading, I actually am serious about Telnet. (Note:
I am not talking about telnetd.) The Telnet protocol is made up of two
parts: the server portion, telnetd, and the client portion, Telnet. Now, I
won't pretend to disagree with the general attitudes toward the server
portion, telnetd, and its inherent insecurities. But, I also think we
shouldn't throw out the baby with the bathwater. 
</p><p>
The client portion, Telnet, is a very useful tool in its
own right. Say you're
trying to configure your mail client and are running into
problems. What options do you have? First, check to
see whether the mail POP server is up. How? Why ping it, of
course. Oh, but the IT staff drank the ICMP Kool-Aid and decided to
block all ICMP traffic. So, now ping won't work. Are you stuck? Of course
not&mdash;Telnet to the rescue.
</p><p>
How can you use Telnet in this situation? Telnet isn't limited to
operating on the standard port. When you run Telnet, you can specify
both a server and a port number. So, you can use it to try to connect to
your mail POP server and check whether it's up by using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
telnet popserver.com 110
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, you're trying to connect to the POP server in order to
read your mail. As Telnet operates over TCP, blocking ICMP
packets shouldn't be troubling. Running the above, you should see a response
like this (assuming that the mail server is up and running):

<pre     class="programlisting">
Trying X.X.X.X...
Connected to popserver.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
+OK InterMail POP3 server ready.
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can see that the
mail server is up, so there must be another issue. This is where Telnet
becomes really useful. POP is a text-based protocol, like many other
Internet protocols. Because it is just text going back and forth, you can
use the Telnet client to talk to the mail server.
</p><p>
For the POP protocol, you simply can log in with your user name and
password by using the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
USER username
PASS password
-ERR invalid user name or password
</pre>
</p><p>
With the above, you can check that you got the credentials right. As you can
see in the example, the password is wrong. Trying again with the correct
password gets you into the mail POP server. You can check whether you have
mail with this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
LIST
+OK 0 messages
</pre>
</p><p>
You even can use Telnet to send e-mail. If you have access to a mail
server, you can connect to port 25 and send e-mail using the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">

telnet mailserver.com 25
Trying X.X.X.X...
Connected to mailserver.com
Escape character is '^]'.
220 mailserver.com ESMTP Postfix
MAIL FROM:&lt;user1@host1.com&gt;
250 2.1.0 Ok
RCPT TO:&lt;user2@host2.com&gt;
250 2.1.5 Ok
DATA
354 End data with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;
From: user1@host1.com
To: user2@host2.com
Subject: Test

Hello. This is a test of sending mail by telnet.

Joey
.
250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 1DE8B2830E38
QUIT
221 2.0.0 Bye
Connection closed by foreign host.

</pre>
</p><p>
POP and SMTP are not the only text-based protocols on the Internet.
You can use Telnet to check Web sites too. Most Web servers operate on
port 80. If you want to check connection issues with a Web site, you can
use this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
telnet google.com 80
</pre>
</p><p>
And, you'll get a result like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Trying 74.125.45.100...
Connected to google.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
</pre>
</p><p>
The HTTP protocol also is text-based, so if you want a particular page,
use the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

GET index.html
HTTP/0.9 200 OK
Cache-Control: private, max-age=0
Date: Mon, 06 Jul 2009 18:29:40 GMT
Expires: -1
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
Server: gws

&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;.........

</pre>
</p><p>
And, you will get the page back from the Web server. Telnet is the
smallest and simplest mail client and Web browser, all wrapped into one.
Of course, you need to have several Internet protocols memorized, but you
really shouldn't be so lazy.
</p><p>
Using this ability, you also can do some basic system probing. With nmap, another
popular tool, you can get a list of the open ports on a host machine.
Starting there, you can try connecting to each of the ports and seeing
what kind of output you receive. I had to do this recently with a remote
site where I was having difficulty connecting to the host through SSH.
Using Telnet, I was able to see the initial response from the SSH server
as the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
telnet host.com 22
Trying X.X.X.X...
Connected to host.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
SSH-1.99-OpenSSH_3.9p1
</pre>
</p><p>
This told me there was an issue with the particular version being run
on the server, and I was able to go to the system administrator with an
intelligent argument for upgrading the SSH server program.
</p><p>
It's still good to keep Telnet
around&mdash;at least the client portion. Although the server portion has been
considered a security risk in the past, the client portion 
can serve as a useful tool in network diagnostics. Sometimes old
tools are the best, at least for some jobs. Have fun exploring your
networks.

As the proud owner of both a Sony PRS-505 and a Kindle DX, it's quickly
come to my attention that most eBook software is designed for operating
systems other than Linux. With the Kindle, Amazon is trying to remedy
that with computer-less converting over e-mail and such, but many of us
want more local control. We also want to manage non-DRM books obtained
from other vendors. Thankfully, the people behind the open-source
Calibre fully support Linux with their Java-based program. Honestly,
it's the best eBook management software available for any platform,
so as Linux users, we're not sacrificing anything.
</p><p>
Calibre manages to do several things, and do them well:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
It makes a sortable and searchable eBook library.
</p></li><li><p>
It converts eBooks to formats supported by all major eBook readers.
</p></li><li><p>
Books can be uploaded directly to the eBook readers.
</p></li><li><p>
It automatically retrieves metadata and cover art.
</p></li><li><p>
Blogs, newspapers and other on-line information can be 
downloaded automatically and converted to eBook formats.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
With all those features, Calibre still manages to be free and open.
If you own an eBook reader or are considering buying one, check out

<h2 class="title">Google Voice&mdash;One Ring(tone) to Rule Them All</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #186, October 2009</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
There is a scene in the movie <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lawnmower Man</em></span> where every phone on the
planet rings at the same time. Although Google may be the biggest technical
force on the Internet, I don't think it's quite to that point.
With the advent of Google Voice (<a href="http://www.google.com/voice" target="_self">www.google.com/voice</a>), however, it's getting closer.
The idea behind GV is that a single phone number can be used for all
your telecommunications. Because I finally got an invite to the closed
beta phase of Google Voice, I can explain a bit about it firsthand.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
When (if?) you get an invite to Google Voice, it binds to your Gmail
account. You get to pick a phone number from a giant pool of available
numbers. The catch is you get to choose only one time. Many area codes
are available, as are many exchanges within them. The coolest part about
picking a number, however, is Google gives you a tool to alphanumerically
choose. Think (123) Coke-Fan might be a nifty number? With the tool, you
can test for availability. I like the number I got so much, I'm almost
tempted to post it here&mdash;almost. Once you pick your number and verify
at least one telephone, you get to set up rules. The rules are amazing.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Based on Caller ID, Google Voice will route calls however you desire
(Figure 1). Contacts are placed into groups, and rules are set up for
specific groups. It's possible for certain contacts to ring only certain
phones, or you can have custom greetings for some people or even direct some
people automatically to voice mail. In fact, with &ldquo;call
presentation&rdquo;,
you can listen in to voice mail while it's being left.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10549googlef1.large.jpg"><img src="10549googlef1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Contacts are sorted into groups, which can have
drastically different call rules.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One issue with Google Voice is that if you call people directly with
your cell phone (or home phone), they see your actual number instead of
your Google Voice number. Thankfully, Google has a couple ways to solve that.
If you look up the contact on-line, you can click a call button that
calls both you and the person you are trying to reach. You answer
your phone to hear it ringing on the other end. Another option is to
call your own Google Voice number from one of your phones. You get
a voice prompt to make a call, and then you type in the number for the
person you are trying to reach. Not only is this a way to have others
see your Google Voice number as the incoming call, but if you're lucky
enough to have one of those cell-phone plans that allows for a certain
number of &ldquo;free&rdquo; numbers, you can add your Google Voice number to your
&ldquo;circle&rdquo;
and never pay for minutes again (hopefully, there aren't any cell-phone
companies reading this).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One more trick up the sleeve of the big Goog is what I refer to as its
&ldquo;Montana Magic&rdquo;. If you get an SMS text message to your Google Voice
number, it automagically is converted to a number in the (406) area code.
Thankfully, the first few letters of the message display the contact name,
because a random text message from an area code in Montana might be a
bit hard to explain otherwise. Once that number is created, however,
you can use it to call or text directly to your contact. The number will
work only if it's called from one of your phones, but if you call it,
the person on the other end sees your Google Voice number instead of
your actual number. It is rather complicated, but brilliant as well.
</p><p>
Voice transcription, on the other hand, isn't exactly what I'd call
brilliant. I'm absolutely certain it will get better with time. Why am
I certain? Because it couldn't possibly get worse. I realize voice mail
and voice-mail transcription are both free services, so I'm not really
complaining, but the quality of transcription is indescribably horrible.
</p><p>
If you get a chance to get a Google Voice number, or if you were a
GrandCentral (<a href="http://www.grandcentral.com" target="_self">www.grandcentral.com</a>) user that
automatically was enrolled into the Google
Voice beta pool, it really is a fun service to play with. I must
admit, I'm a bit leery about publishing the number as my single point of
contact, because since Google Voice is a free service, it could vanish at any time.
The thought of business cards and such being worthless in an instant is
a bit disheartening. As a way to shield your cell-phone number and add
some phone-spam protection, however, Google Voice is quite a nice tool.

If you're a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> reader, chances are you're pretty familiar with
the command line. Don't let that stop you from heading over to our Web site
and checking out our daily tech tip videos. Heck, I make the majority of
them, and I still learn stuff from time to time. Even if you know every
tip we throw at you, feel free to deflect new users at us. I must warn
you, however, before you know it, those &ldquo;n00bs&rdquo; will end up knowing more
tips and tricks than you. Don't say we didn't warn you!

A little hack here and a little tweak there, and you have a new
LinuxJournal.com.
</p><p>
While working on the new version of the site you all know and love, I
have thought about the word &ldquo;hack&rdquo; a lot. I think we in the Open
Source community in particular have found &ldquo;hack&rdquo; to be a useful term
with a broad definition. When working with software and platforms
that are community supported, there is not always a &ldquo;right&rdquo; way to do
things or a well-documented process. Thus, we find ourselves making
our own recipes and hacks to get the job done whichever way we can.
To me, a new way of laying out a Web page may require a workaround
that I think of as a theming hack, or I may need to write or modify a
Drupal module in order to add functionality to <span   class="emphasis"><em>avoid</em></span> hacking, as I
always follow the first rule of Drupal, &ldquo;don't hack core!&rdquo; Are these
code modifications worthy of the word &ldquo;hack&rdquo;? I can't break in to a
secure network, but I can (usually) find a solution to a Web
development conundrum.
</p><p>
Maybe we're all hackers then. As you read through this month's
articles focused on hacks, I hope you discover a new way of solving
your problems, a workaround that saves you some time, or even just a
bit of inspiration that leads you to something new and different.
Then, visit LinuxJournal.com to share your hacks with the rest of us!
