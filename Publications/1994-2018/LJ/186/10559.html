htop&mdash;Improved, Intuitive Version of top
(<a href="http://htop.sourceforge.net" target="_self">htop.sourceforge.net</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
htop aims to be a better version of the long-lived UNIX program,
top. Allowing you to browse through your system processes with the
keyboard, htop is a much more intuitive way of doing things than the
traditional and archaic UNIX way. The htop Web site gives the
best summary with this comparison of htop and top:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
In htop, you can scroll the list vertically and horizontally to
see all processes and complete command lines.
</p></li><li><p>
In top, you are subject to a delay for each unassigned key you press
(especially annoying when multikey escape sequences are triggered
by accident).
</p></li><li><p>
htop starts faster (top seems to collect data for a while before
displaying anything).
</p></li><li><p>
In htop, you don't need to type the process number to kill a process;
in top, you do.
</p></li><li><p>
In htop, you don't need to type the process number or the priority
value to renice a process; in top, you do.
</p></li><li><p>
htop supports mouse operation; top doesn't.
</p></li><li><p>
top is older, hence, more used and tested.
</p></li></ul></div></blockquote></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10559f1.large.jpg"><img src="10559f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
htop vastly improves on the old top UNIX tool, with an interface
that lets you browse through your processes with the keyboard.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10559f2.large.jpg"><img src="10559f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Being able to choose what kind of signal you want
to send to a process adds versatility.
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
If you're chasing binaries, packages are provided in either
native or third-party form for GoboLinux, Debian, Fedora, Red Hat,
Slackware, Gentoo, ALT Linux, OpenSUSE, Mandriva, KateOS and Zenwalk. For
those going with source, head to the Downloads/SVN page, grab the latest
tarball and extract it, or SVN the nightly development tree. In terms
of requirements for compiling the source, the only oddity I ran into was
that I needed to install the development files for ncurses (in my case,
libncurses5-dev).
</p><p>
Open a terminal in the new source directory (whether from an extracted
tarball or SVN), and enter the usual:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the compilation finishes, run the program by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ htop
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Once inside the htop screen, you'll see things arranged in a way
that will make instant sense to those used to some Linux mainstays, such
as xosview, Midnight Commander and various system monitors, including, of
course, top. At the top of the screen is a selection of handy system
information,
such as CPU usage, free memory, swap usage and so on. In the center of
the screen are all of your system's processes waiting to be browsed,
and in classic Norton/Midnight Commander style, the functions of the
program are sensibly linked to the function keys of your keyboard, laid
out clearly on the bottom of the screen. Take note of that in
particular, as you'll be using those functions the most.
</p><p>
To get started, you can browse through your processes with the arrow
keys along with Page Up and Page Down. If you want to kill or tinker
with a process, press either K or F9. At this point, htop brings up a
menu of possible signals to send the program, with SIGTERM
being the default choice. Scroll through these if you want to play with
more-advanced features, but for most users, just pressing F9 and Enter
will do the job fine.
</p><p>
You can kill multiple jobs 
by pressing
the spacebar on each one. 
The Search function is mapped to F3, allowing you to
search for any part of text in the name of the process you're chasing,
which comes in handy particularly for overburdened systems with too many
processes. The SortBy function, mapped to F6, also is of great help, especially
when you want to sort between system- and user-owned processes. And, the
Tree function, mapped to F5, is fantastic for seeking things like tricky
child processes. This program is fairly loaded with features,
so it's worth checking the htop man page and the help screen (assigned
to F1) for more information.
</p><p>
Ultimately, htop is a good evolutionary step from unintuitive,
older programs like top, and with any luck, it will be included by default
with most distros in the years to come. Although the interface still
might be a little intimidating for novices, intermediate or advanced users
should come to grips with it easily (and let's face it,
they're the ones who'll be using it anyway).

Open Cubic Player 
(<a href="http://stian.cubic.org/project-ocp.php" target="_self">stian.cubic.org/project-ocp.php</a>)</h2></div></div><p>
Open Cubic Player (OCP) is a text-based audio player that runs
in various incarnations on Linux and Windows, and there's even an older DOS
version. First appearing in late 1994, the original program
was a binary-only freeware version called Cubic Player (running primarily
in DOS). It had a reputation for being one of the best module players
around, as it supported a great deal of soundcards as well as audio
formats. As Windows grew more popular and people demanded GUI-based
software, popularity and support for the program died off, as did the
project itself.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10559f3.large.jpg"><img src="10559f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Open Cubic Player gives wonderful visualizations rendered in real time
with pure ASCII.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10559f4.large.jpg"><img src="10559f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Thankfully, browsing for audio files is an easy affair, and there are
many advanced features that major GUI players don't even have.
</p></div></div><p>
Eventually, the source code was opened up to the public in the hope
that someone would find it useful, and in late 2003, developer Stian
Sebastian Skjelstad started playing around with it, attempting 
to get the source to compile and run under Linux. After a great
deal of tinkering around, Stian eventually got something working,
and today, it's available in beta form. And quite frankly, it's a little
ripper of a player!
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Installation</b></span>
</p><p>
Binary packages are provided for Debian and Ubuntu, as well as some
specific information for installation on other systems, but if you're not
using the basic .deb packages, you might as well install OCP from
source. Grab the latest tarball from the Web site, extract it, and open a
terminal in the new folder. As for strange requirements with the source,
I had to grab the development files for both ogg and vorbis, which were
liboggz1-dev and libvorbis-dev, respectively. Being a wacky console
program, you probably need the ncurses development libraries too,
but I already had those on my system after compiling htop (see above).
</p><p>
When it comes to compiling the source, documentation is sorely lacking,
but thankfully, compilation is a simple case of the usual:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
</pre>
</p><p>
When the compilation is over, run the program by entering:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ocp
</pre>
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Usage</b></span>
</p><p>
Although I'm still coming to grips with the basic controls, playing
singular files is a simple affair, as is
exploring the program's many functions. When you enter the OCP screen, your
first encounter is with the file browser, where you can select your
songs, append them to a playlist and so on. I'm not too sure 
how to operate the playlist functions confidently enough to explain them
(you can work out the contents of the manual yourself), but playing a
single file is easy. Simply search for the file you want with the up and
down arrow keys. Entering directories or playing a file is done by
pressing the Enter key.
</p><p>
When a track is playing, this whole project comes to life, and
the point becomes clear&mdash;you instantly have full visualizations of
your music along with neat power-level indicators and all manner of
tinkering functions. This is designed for control freaks&mdash;seriously. On
screen is a load of information, right down to file size, frequency and
format information, and so on. However, it's the functions that are the
meat of the program. You can alter the panning, balance, speed, pitch,
amplification and more. You even can turn on a surround function&mdash;not bad for
a text-based player!
</p><p>
These functions are mostly spread over the function keys, but the
coolest feature (although admittedly a little gimmicky) is actually
pausing a
song. Press P, and your song winds down and dies like someone has just
pulled the plug on an old reel-to-reel player. Unpausing winds
it back up to life again. It's really cool and adds genuine charm to
the player.
</p><p>
Working your way around this program is initially
unintuitive, and the documentation feels as if it's written more for
other programmers than new users, but the charm of this program is
unavoidable. The beautiful spectrum analyzer patterns rendered in
real-time ASCII are enough to bring a tear to any geek's eye, and the
advanced controls one expects only of complex, resource-intensive GUI
applications will entrench this player firmly in the heart of many a
technophile. Awesome stuff&mdash;if you can work your way around it!

<span   class="bold"><b>UnixTree</b></span>
(<a href="http://www.unixtree.org" target="_self">www.unixtree.org</a>)
</p><p>
Much like Midnight Commander captured the feel and essence of the
popular DOS application, Norton Commander, UnixTree models itself closely
on the once popular XTreeGold. XTreeGold was the introduction that many
first PC users had with DOS, which, much like Norton Commander, had a
semi-GUI interface to ease the transition into a tricky environment. Although
this may not strike an instant chord with command-line purists or
full-blown X users, I know a number of people for whom XTreeGold was
their primary interface day to day, and hopefully, UnixTree will
ease their transition into the UNIX shell in the same way XTreeGold did
for DOS. I've had a chance to use it, and I'm quite impressed, especially
as certain essential UNIX commands are assigned to single keystrokes to
speed up your daily command-line usage.

<a href="http://lightless.org/gnake" target="_self">lightless.org/gnake</a>)
</p><p>
Anyone who has a mobile phone will know the time-old classic game,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Snake</em></span>. I still play the popular X game
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Gnibbles</em></span> from time to time, and
I've always had a soft spot for the style of gameplay.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Gnake</em></span> brings
that gameplay to the console in a rather simplified form, but still,
it's damn hard. Compilation is easy; simply grab the tarball, enter
<tt  >make</tt> and then <tt  >./gnake</tt>. I'm not
sure whether the levels progress (I
haven't passed stage one), but some of the options that can be
altered include the playground size, speed, number of apples,
growing length and the ability to add computer-controlled snakes.

Console Commander</b></span>
(<a href="http://concom.sourceforge.net" target="_self">concom.sourceforge.net</a>)
</p><p>
Console Commander brings you a selection of information and system
tools under an easy-to-navigate group of menus that should be of serious
comfort to anyone not familiar with the Linux shell. Some of the clever
features group together the sorts of information I've always had to
dig through large GUI programs to reach, like Kinfocenter. Information, such
as CPU type, free memory, partition usage, distro info and so on, is
usually a pain to hunt down individually. Combined with tools that
automate tasks like package and repository upgrades, how-tos and many
more features, this is a handy program indeed. Although there's nothing
technically amazing happening here, it has no pretenses about what it
is and will save time for many users. I love it.
