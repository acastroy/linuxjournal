Add some pseudo-randomness to your scripts and user interaction.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x279c580.0x28943b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I just migrated onto a newer, bigger server (read that as &ldquo;more
expensive&rdquo;, of course, but because my traffic's justifying it, I'm
good with the change). To make matters more interesting, I also just bought a
new laptop (a MacBook Pro), and between the two migrations, I've been looking
through a lot of old directories and bumping into all sorts of scripts I've
written in the past few years.
</p><p>
The one I thought would be interesting to explore here is one
I wrote for a pal who was involved in a charity and wanted a way to have a
single URL bounce people 50/50 to one of two different Web pages&mdash;a sort of mini-load balancer, though his application wasn't quite
the same.
</p><p>
The core piece of this is the $RANDOM shell variable that's actually kind of
magical&mdash;each time you reference it, you'll find it's different, even
though you aren't actually assigning a new value to it. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ echo $RANDOM
21960
$ echo $RANDOM
19045
$ echo $RANDOM
2368
$ echo $RANDOM
2425
$ echo $RANDOM
10629
</pre>
</p><p>
This violates the core user design principles of the shell and even the very
definition of variables (which are supposed to be predictable&mdash;if you assign the
value 37 to it, it still should have that value 200 lines and
17 references later). Other variables change value based on what
you're doing, without you actually assigning it a new value, like $PWD, but
because that's the present working directory, if you move around in the
filesystem, it's logical that its value would change too.
</p><p>
The RANDOM value, however, is in a category of its own and makes it super easy
to add some pseudo-randomness to your scripts and user interaction (whether
it's truly random is a far more complicated&mdash;mind-numbingly complex&mdash;issue. If
you're interested, try Googling &ldquo;determining the
randomness of random numbers&rdquo; to jump down that particular rabbit hole.
</p><p>
In the Bourne Again Shell (bash), RANDOM numbers are within the range of
0..MAXINT (32,767). To chop it down and make it useful, you can simply divide it
by the max numeric value you seek.
</p><p>
In other words, if you want a random number between 1..10, for example, use the
% &ldquo;remainder&rdquo; function with a call to expr:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ expr $RANDOM % 10
7
$ expr $RANDOM % 10
5
$ expr $RANDOM % 10
9
$ expr $RANDOM % 10
6
$ expr $RANDOM % 10
8
</pre>
</p><p>
Boiling this down further, how to choose between two options randomly now should be
jumping out of the page at you, dear reader:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ "$(expr $RANDOM % 2 )" -eq "0" ] ; then
      conditional expression
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
If you wanted to be a purist, you also could write this with the $(( )) math
notation, of course, as you'll see a bit later in this column.
</p><p>
That's enough for us to write the shell script I mentioned earlier, 
the one that randomly switched between two possible pages when invoked:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/local/bin/bash
url1="http://www.bing.com/"
url2="http://www.google.com/"
if [ "$(expr $RANDOM % 2 )" -eq "0" ] ; then
  echo "Location: $url1"; echo ""
else
  echo "Location: $url2"; echo ""
fi
exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Can you see what this example script does? If you guessed &ldquo;randomly
redirects you to either Google or Bing&rdquo;, you're right! If not, well,
what the heck? Go back and read the code again!
</p><p>
Now, let's say my friend said &ldquo;75% of the time, I really want to take
people to URL1. Can you do it, Dave?&rdquo;
</p><p>
Here's how that might look:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ "$(expr $RANDOM % 100 )" -lt "75" ] ; then
</pre>
</p><p>
(Or, even more clearly as <tt  >% 4 -lt 3</tt>, for that matter.)
</p><p>
If you have more than two choices, you can use a case statement that
makes uneven allocation a bit tricky but otherwise is straightforward:

<pre     class="programlisting">
case $(( $RANDOM % 4 )) in
  0 ) echo $url1;               ;;
  1 ) echo $url2;               ;;
  2 ) echo $url3;               ;;
  3 ) echo $url4;               ;;
esac
</pre>

Load Balancing with ruptime</h2></div></div><p>
With this in mind, we could write an n-way load-balancing script, so that when
people come to the home page, they automatically would be bounced to
one of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> possible servers.
</p><p>
The interesting step actually would be to round-robin them, based on the server
load, of course, which could be done by stepping through the data using 
the ruptime command.
</p><p>
So, given the uptime output of:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ruptime host1
host1   16:51  up 3+53:17, 3 users, load 0.65 0.68 0.51
</pre>
</p><p>
What we really want is to get a list of hostnames sorted by how busy those
systems are, which can be generated by ruptime with the -rl
flags, as shown here:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ruptime -r -l
host1   down   16+08:34
host4   up     10+13:26,   7 users,  load 0.07, 0.39, 1.04
host3   up     14+06:49,   3 users,  load 0.10, 0.38, 0.49
host2   up      1+17:40,   4 users,  load 0.18, 0.13, 0.09
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, the first step is to screen out the hosts that aren't
actually up at the present moment, then grab the first field (as it's
sorted by how busy the system is at the current moment).
</p><p>
One approach to this could be to call ruptime every time a request
comes in and just grab the first value. This can be done like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ruptime -rl | grep -v down | head -1 | cut -d\  -f1
host2
</pre>
</p><p>
The trouble is that the systems report uptime information only approximately
every minute,
and calling ruptime dozens or hundreds of times per second can end up
producing a problem&mdash;the least-busy system will be swamped. If you get a lot of
traffic, that's not going to be a manageable solution.
</p><p>
Here's where we could have our friend $RANDOM step back into the
picture. Instead of always simply picking the machine with the lowest load
average, let's randomly choose one of the three least-busy systems.
The core snippet would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
getline="$(( ( $RANDOM % 3 ) + 1 ))"
targethost="$(ruptime -rl | grep -v down |

   sed -n ${getline}p | cut -d\  -f1)"
</pre>
</p><p>
With a bit more code, you could bias it so that, say, 50% of the time it would
pick
the least-busy system, 33% of the time it would pick the second-least-busy system,
and 17% of the time it would pick the third-least-busy system. As time passed
and as the load moved around, these systems would keep changing, and you'd
achieve a crude but effective load-balancing system.
</p><p>
Knowing how easily you can select one of a number of possible paths randomly in
a shell script, what else can you imagine that would be helpful or just fun?
