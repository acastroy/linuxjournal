<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_10">What's New in Kernel Development by Zack Brown</h2>


<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">New NOVA Filesystem</h3>

<p>
<strong>Andiry Xu</strong> (working with <strong>Lu Zhang</strong>,
<strong>Steven Swanson</strong> and others) posted
patches for a new filesystem called <strong>NOVA</strong> (NOn-Volatile
memory Accelerated).
Normal <strong>RAM</strong> chips are wiped every time you turn off your
computer. Non-volatile RAM retains its data across reboots. Their project
targeted byte-addressable non-volatile memory chips, such as
<strong>Intel</strong>'s
<strong>3DXpoint DIMMs</strong>. Andiry said that the current incarnation of
their code was
able to do a lot already, but they still had a big to-do list, and they
wanted feedback from the kernel people.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Theodore Y. Ts'o</strong> gave the patches a try, but he found that
they wouldn't even
compile without some fixes, which he posted in reply. Andiry said they'd
adapt those fixes into their patches.
</p>

<p>
The last time NOVA made an appearance on the kernel mailing list was August
2017, when Steven made a similar announcement. This time around, they
posted a lot more patches, including support for <strong>SysFS</strong>
controls, <strong>Kconfig</strong>
compilation options and a significant amount of documentation.
</p>

<p>
One of NOVA's main claims to fame, aside from supporting non-volatile RAM,
is that it is a log-based filesystem. Other filesystems generally map out
their data structures on disk and update those structures in place. This
is good for saving seek-time on optical and magnetic disks. Log-based
filesystems write everything sequentially, trailing old data behind them. The
old data then can be treated as a snapshot of earlier states of the
filesystem, or it can be reclaimed when space gets tight.
</p>

<p>
Log-based filesystems are not necessarily preferred for optical and
magnetic drives, because sequential writes will tend to fragment data and
slow things down. Non-volatile RAM is based on different technology that
has faster seek-times, making a log-based approach a natural choice.
</p>

<p>
NOVA goes further than most log-based filesystems, which tend to have a
single log for the whole filesystem, and instead maintains a separate log
for each inode. Using the log data, NOVA can perform writes either in place
like traditional filesystems or as copy-on-write (COW) operations, which
keep the old version of a file until the new version has been written. This
has the benefit of being able to survive catastrophic events like sudden
power failures in the middle of doing a write, without corrupting the
filesystem.
</p>

<p>
There were lots of responses to the patches from Andiry and the rest of his
team. Most were bug reports and criticism, but no controversy. Everyone
seemed to be interested in helping them get their code right so the patches
could get into the main tree quickly.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Removing All Syscall Invocations from Kernel Space</h3>

<p>
There's an effort underway to reduce and ultimately remove all system call
invocations from within kernel space. <strong>Dominik Brodowski</strong> was
leading this
effort, and he posted some patches to remove a lot of instances from the
kernel. Among other things, he said, these patches would make it easier to
clean up and optimize the <strong>syscall</strong> entry points, and also
easier to clean up the
parts of the kernel that still needed to pretend to be in userspace, just
so they could keep using syscalls.
</p>

<p>
The rationale behind these patches, as expressed by <strong>Andy
Lutomirski</strong>,
ultimately was to prevent user code from ever gaining access to kernel
memory.
Sharing syscalls between kernel space and user space made that impossible
at the moment. Andy hoped the patches would go into the kernel quickly,
without needing to wait for further cleanup.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> had absolutely no criticism of these patches,
and he indicated
that this was a well desired change. He offered to do a little extra
housekeeping himself with the kernel release schedule to make Dominik's
tasks easier. Linus also agreed with Andy that any cleanup effort could
wait—he didn't mind accepting ugly patches to update the syscall
calling
conventions first, and then accept the cleanup patches later.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Ingo Molnar</strong> predicted that with Dominik's changes, the size
of the compiled
kernel would decrease—always a good thing. But Dominik said no, and in
fact, he ran some quick numbers for Ingo and found that with his patches, the
compiled kernel was actually a few bytes larger. Ingo was surprised but not
mortified, saying the slight size increase would not be a showstopper.
</p>

<p>
This project is similar—although maybe smaller in scope—to the
effort
to get rid of the <strong>big kernel lock</strong> (BKL). In the case of the
BKL, no one
could figure out for years even how to begin to replace it, until finally
folks decided to convert all BKL instances into identical local
implementations that could be replaced piecemeal with more specialized and
less heavyweight locks. After that, it was just a question of slogging
through each one until finally even the most finicky instances were
replaced with more specialized locking code.
</p>

<p>
Dominik seems to be using a similar technique now, in which areas of the
kernel that still need syscalls can masquerade as userspace, while areas
of the kernel that are easier to fix get cleaned up first.
</p>

<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Loading Arbitrary Executables as Kernel Modules</h3>

<p>
<strong>Alexei Starovoitov</strong> posted some patches to allow the kernel
to load regular
<strong>ELF</strong> binaries (aka plain executables) as kernel modules.
These modules
would be able to run user-mode helper routines instead of being absolutely
confined to kernel space.
</p>

<p>
Alexei listed a variety of benefits for this. For one thing, as a user
process, an ELF-based module could crash without bringing down the rest of
the kernel. And although the ELF modules would run with root privileges, he
said that a security breach would not lead directly into accessing the
kernel's
inner workings, but at least initially would be confined to userspace. The
ELF module also could be terminated by the out-of-memory (OOM) killer, in
case of need, or ended directly by a human administrator. It additionally
would be
feasible to subject ELF-based modules to regular userspace debugging and
profiling, using the vast array of tools available for that.
</p>

<p>
Initially there were various technical questions and criticisms, but no one
spoke out immediately against it. Linus Torvalds said he
liked the feature,
but he wanted one change: to make the type of module visible in the system
logs. He said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When we load a regular module, at least it shows in lsmod
afterwards, although I have a few times wanted to really see module load as
an event in the logs too. When we load a module that just executes a user
program, and there is no sign of it in the module list, I think we *really*
need to make that event show to the admin some way.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And he said specifically, "I do *not* want this to be a magical way to hide
things."
</p>

<p>
Andy Lutomirski raised a pertinent question: why not just
retool the
<strong>modprobe</strong> program to handle ELF binaries as desired, rather
than doing
anything with kernel code at all? In other words, why couldn't this feature
be implemented entirely outside the kernel?
</p>

<p>
But Linus replied:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The less we have to mess with user-mode tooling, the better.
</p>

<p>
We've been *so* much better off moving most of the module loading logic to
the kernel, we should not go back in the old broken direction.
</p>

<p>
I do *not* want the kmod project that is then taken over by systemd, and
breaks it the same way they broke firmware loading.
</p>

<p>
Keep modprobe doing one thing, and one thing only: track dependencies and
mindlessly just load the modules. Do *not* ask for it to do anything else.
</p>

<p>
Right now kmod is a nice simple project. Lots of testsuite stuff, and a
very clear goal. Let's keep kmod doing one thing, and not even have to care
about internal kernel decisions like "oh, this module might not be a
module, but an executable".
</p>

<p>
If anything, I think we want to keep our options open, in the case we need
or want to ever consider short-circuiting things and allowing direct
loading of the simple cases and bypassing modprobe entirely.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At one point, <strong>Kees Cook</strong> did offer some more serious
criticisms of the
patch's basic goal. Primarily, he noticed that Alexei's patch could be used
to—and was intentionally designed to—execute arbitrary
code in userspace automatically. This was different from the kernel's normal
approach to
modules, in which they could be loaded but not executed automatically.
</p>

<p>
Kees said, "This just extends all the problems we've had with defining
security boundaries with modules out to umh [user-mode helper code] too. I
would need some major convincing that this can be made safe."
</p>

<p>
He pointed out that a certain class of kernel bugs—apparently prevalent
in the recent past—could redirect module loading outside of a virtual
machine (that is, a container) and into the main kernel itself. And since
containers could trigger loading an arbitrary module, this meant that a
hostile user potentially could load an ELF module, redirect it back to the
main kernel, and execute its attacking code immediately with full
privileges.
</p>

<p>
Kees refused to let the patch go into the kernel as written. He said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
At
the very least, you need to solve the execution environment problems here:
the ELF should run with no greater privileges than what loaded the module,
and very importantly, must not be allowed to bypass these checks through
autoloading. What <em>triggered</em> the autoload must be the environment,
not the
"modprobe", since that's running with full privileges.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the flip side, however, Kees acknowledged that Alexei's patch was an
"interesting idea. I think it <em>can</em> work, it just needs much much more
careful security boundaries and to solve our autoloading exposures too."
</p>

<p>
However, Alexei characterized Kees' response as "security paranoia without
single concrete example of a security issue."
</p>

<p>
And Andy also disagreed with Kees' assessment. He pointed out that Kees'
issue depended on an attacker finding and exploiting an additional
vulnerability that would allow containers to redirect a module outside of
itself—something that was not a kernel feature and that would be
treated
as a bug if it were ever discovered.
</p>

<p>
Kees agreed with Andy that the problem was not with Alexei's code but
instead with potential vulnerabilities elsewhere in the kernel. He said, "I
just don't want to extend that problem further." And he added that he
wasn't opposed to Alexei's patch, but that his concerns were not paranoia,
and "there are very real security boundary violations in this model."
</p>

<p>
At one point, in defense of Alexei's approach, Andy said, "I don't see how
this is any more exploitable than any other init_module()." And Linus
replied:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Absolutely. If Kees doesn't trust the files to be loaded, an
executable—even if it's running with root privileges and in the
initns—is still
fundamentally weaker than a kernel module.
</p>

<p>
So I don't understand the security argument AT ALL. It's nonsensical. The
executable loading does all the same security checks that the module
loading does, including the signing check.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Kees acknowledged that his concern was not with Alexei's code itself, or
even with the design of the feature. But he felt that if certain other bugs
did appear in the kernel—as they had before—then someone would be
able to exploit the feature to run arbitrary code at the root level.
</p>

<p>
However, Linus had spoken, and Kees' concern over potential future bugs
were apparently not a showstopper. And just to hammer it home, <strong>David
S.
Miller</strong> reiterated Linus' point that kernel modules were far more
dangerous
than executable code, because they could access any container and namespace
they pleased.
</p>

<p>
But this was not the end of the story!
</p>

<p>
Close by to this part of the conversation, Linus said to Kees:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
My own
personal worry is actually different—we do check the signature of the
file we're loading, but we're then passing it off to execve() not as the
image we loaded, but as the file pointer. So the execve() will end up not
using the actual buffer we checked the signature on, but instead just
re-reading the file.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Among other things, Linus said, "somebody could maybe try to time it and
modify the file after-the-fact of the signature check, and then we execute
something else."
</p>

<p>
He went on to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Initially, I thought it was a non-issue, because anybody who
controls the module subdirectory enough to rewrite files would be in a
position to just execute the file itself directly instead. But it turns out
that isn't needed. Some bad actor could just do <code>finit_module()</code>
with a
file that they just *copied* from the module directory.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Linus said this issue had to be addressed before the patch could go into
the kernel.
</p>

<p>
Andy also noticed something else that might be a deal-killer. He said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
This patch is a potentially severe ABI break. Right now, loading a module
*copies* it into memory and does not hold a reference to the underlying fs.
With the patch applied, all kinds of use cases can break in gnarly ways.
Initramfs is maybe okay, but initrd may be screwed. If you load an ET_EXEC
module from initrd, then umount it, then clear the ramdisk, something will
go horribly wrong. Exactly what goes wrong depends on whether userspace
notices that umount() failed. Similarly, if you load one of these modules
over a network and then lose your connection, you have a problem.
</p>
              
</blockquote>

<p>
He explained further, "Without your patch, init_module doesn't keep
using the file, so it's common practice to load a module and then
delete or unmount it. With your patch, the unmount case breaks. This is
likely to break existing userspace, so, in Linux speak, it's an ABI
break."
</p>

<p>
At this point—regarding Linus' security exploit—Andy felt that
Kees' thumbs-up would be more important than he had at first. Kees'
responsibility was module security, which Andy had thought was not an issue
earlier in the discussion. Now that it was, it had become more important to
get Kees' blessing on this patch. Andy pointed out to Alexei, "Kees is
very reasonable, and he'll change his mind and ack a patch that
he's nacked when presented with a valid technical argument."
</p>

<p>
However, he also said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
My ABI break observation is also a major problem,
and Linus is going to be pissed if this thing lands in his tree and breaks
systems due to an issue that was raised during review. So I think you need
to either rework the patch or do a serious survey of how all the distros
deal with modules (dracut, initramfs-tools, all the older stuff, and
probably more) and make sure they can all handle your patch.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alexei replied that neither of these problems were real issues. The ABI
(application binary interface) break didn't really break the kernel ABI,
and the security issue was not a real concern. He said, "I think you need
to stop overreacting on a non-issue."
</p>

<p>
There was a bit of back and forth between them. It turned out that Alexei
didn't believe there was an ABI breakage because in his intended use case,
everything would be done identically to the way it was now, and so nothing
would be broken. But <strong>Greg Kroah-Hartman</strong> replied, "For
<em>your</em> use case, yes.
For mine and Andy's and someone else's in the future, it might be." He
added, "You are creating a very generic, new, user/kernel api that a whole
bunch of people are going to want to use. Let's not hamper the ability for
us all to use this right from the beginning please."
</p>
            
<p>
And in terms of specific use cases, Greg said:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We have userspace drivers
for USB today, being able to drag that out-of-tree codebase into the kernel
is a <em>HUGE</em> bonus, and something that I would love to do for a lot of
reasons. I also can see moving some of our existing in-kernel drivers out
of the kernel in a way that provides "it just works" functionality by using
this type of feature.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A bunch of folks, including Linus, started debating ways to address the
problems that had been identified so far. Alexei got on board after a while
and started implementing changes as they were identified by the group.
</p>

<p>
It seems clear that this feature will go into the kernel. It provides cool
functionality that is hotly desired by Linus and others. But the timing of
getting the code into the kernel will depend on how well Alexei fixes the
various problems, and whether new security or ABI issues arise.
</p>

<p>
This whole discussion was interesting on a number of levels. I particularly
like the speed with which the critics and defenders of Alexei's patch would
change positions, without regard to ego or fear of being seen as "wrong"
or anything like that. And what had started as a wholehearted acceptance of
a new feature, became concern over its possible problems and a quest to
resolve them in a useful way.
</p>

<p>
I also like that Alexei's initial minor defensiveness was not
treated as cause for bullying, and everyone simply tried to keep the
discussion productive. It doesn't always go that way in kernel
development.
</p>

<p>
And of course, I also find it exciting to be able to look in on discussions
of potential kernel weaknesses, how they might be exploited by hostile
actors, and what might be done to stop them. In the early days, that was
exactly how the kernel folks used to talk about Microsoft—right out in
the
open! What might Microsoft do to destroy open source? How might it
destroy the GPL? How might it destroy Linux? And all the while, the
kernel people knew that the Microsoft people were reading their every post,
just as they know now that hostile attackers are eagerly poking and
prodding the mailing list discussions and every patch submission, looking
for usable exploits.
</p>


<h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Removing Support for Dead Hardware</h3>

<p>
<strong>Arnd Bergmann</strong> submitted a patch to remove the Linux ports for a variety of
architectures, including <strong>blackfin</strong>, <strong>cris</strong>,
<strong>frv</strong>, <strong>m32r</strong>, <strong>metag</strong>,
<strong>mn10300</strong>, <strong>score</strong>
and <strong>tile</strong>. To do this, he worked directly with the former maintainers of
each port to make sure the code removal was done right and didn't break
anything in the mainline kernel or anywhere else.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line was that no one used those architectures anymore. He offered
his analysis of why this had happened, saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It seems that while the
eight architectures are extremely different, they all suffered the same
fate: There was one company in charge of an SoC line, a CPU
microarchitecture and a software ecosystem, which was more costly than
licensing newer off-the-shelf CPU cores from a third party (typically ARM,
MIPS, or RISC-V). It seems that all the SoC product lines are still around,
but have not used the custom CPU architectures for several years at this
point. In contrast, CPU instruction sets that remain popular and have
actively maintained kernel ports tend to all be used across multiple
licensees.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Linus Torvalds had no objection to ripping those architectures out of the
kernel, but he did say, "I'd like to see that each architecture removal is
independent of the others, so that if somebody wants to resurrect any
particular architecture, he/she can do so with a revert."
</p>

<p>
Linus pulled the patch into the main kernel tree and noted with glee that
it took a half-million lines of code out of the kernel.
</p>

<p>
Linus was not the only one who wanted to ensure the possibility of easily
resurrecting those architectures. <strong>Geert Uytterhoeven</strong> wanted to know exactly
what would be required, since he had an interest in the
formerly removed and later resurrected <strong>arch/h8300</strong> architecture, currently
still in the kernel and going strong. And he pointed out, "In reality, a
resurrection may not be implemented as a pure revert, but as the addition
of a new architecture, implemented using modern features."
</p>

<p>
To which <strong>Pavel Machek</strong> complained, "By insisting on new features instead of
pure revert + incremental updates, you pretty much make sure resurrection
will not be possible."
</p>

<p>
But Arnd pointed out, "now that the other architectures are gone, a lot of
changes can be done more easily that will be incompatible with a pure
revert, so the more time passes, the harder it will get to do that."
</p>

<p>
And he added, "Some of the architectures (e.g. tile or cris) have been kept
up to date, but others had already bitrotted to the point where they were
unlikely to work on any real hardware for many releases, but a revert could
still be used as a starting point in theory."
</p>

<p>
In any case, Arnd's patches are sailing into the kernel, and those
architectures are, for the moment, dead. But even so, it's odd to see them
removed. There will certainly come a day in the far distant future when a
hardware aficionado decides to write an emulator for them; and then they'll
have to root around in the ancient logs of the kernel git repository to
find versions of Linux that supported them, and those versions of Linux
will run only on ancient hardware that itself will exist only in emulated
form. So they'd have ancient hardware running on an ancient kernel on top
of an emulated ancient CPU being simulated by the latest Quantum
Sine-Qua-Non Ultra Linux (QSQNUL) , powered by black-hole turbines and
puppy-dog hearts.
</p>

<p>
It'll happen.
