<p>
In a February 2018 post titled <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/worth-saving">"Worth Saving"</a>,
I said I'd like <em>Linux Journal</em> to be
for technology what <em>The New Yorker</em> is for New York and <em>National
Geographic</em>
is for geography. In saying this, I meant it should be two things: 1) a magazine readers
value enough not to throw away and 2) about much more than what the name
says, while staying true to the name as well.
</p>

<p>
The only push-back I got was from a guy whose comment called both those
model pubs "fanatically progressive liberal whatever" and said he hoped
we're not "*planning* to emulate those tainted styles". I told him we
weren't.
And, in case that's not clear, I'm saying it here again. (For what it's
worth, I think <em>The New Yorker</em> has some of the best writing anywhere, and
I've hardly seen a <em>National Geographic</em> outside a doctor's office in
decades.)
</p>

<p>
Another commenter asked, "Is there another publication that you'd offer up
as an example to emulate?" I replied, "Three come quickly to mind:
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com"><em>Scientific
American</em></a>, the <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/farewell-dr-dobbs/240169421">late
<em>Dr. Dobb's</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)">Byte</a>. Just think of all three
when they were at their best. I want <em>Linux Journal</em> to honor those and be
better as well."
</p>

<p>
<em>Scientific American</em> is the only one of those three that's still alive. Alas,
it's not what it once was: the most authoritative yet popular science
magazine in the world—or at least, that's how it looked when my parents gave
me a subscription when I was 12. Back then I wanted to read everything I
could about science—when I wasn't beeping code to other ham radio
operators from my bedroom or otherwise avoiding homework assignments.
</p>

<p>
Today, <em>Scientific American</em> is probably as close as it can get to that legacy
ideal while surviving in the mainstream of magazine publishing—meaning
it persists in print and digital form while also maintaining a constant
stream of topical stories on its website.
</p>

<p>
That last thing is the main work of most magazines these days—or so it
seems. As a result, there isn't much difference between <em>Scientific
American</em>,
<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com"><em>Smithsonian</em></a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com"><em>Wired</em></a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> and <a href="https://www.inverse.com"><em>Inverse</em></a>. To demonstrate what I mean,
here are stories from those five publications' websites. See if you can
guess (without clicking on the links) where each one ran—and which one
is a fake headline:

</li>
</ul>

<p>
The problem with all of them isn't only that they could run anywhere, but
that they are all just <em>content</em>—or seem to be, no matter how good they
might actually be. (While they can be very good, one example of how they
often aren't is that I had to fix the spelling in one of the five real
headlines.)
</p>

<p>
Here's what I said in <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/problem-content">"The Problem
with Content"</a> (in the March 2017 issue of <em>Linux
Journal</em>):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Back in the early '00s, John Perry Barlow said "I didn't start hearing about
'content' until the container business felt threatened." <em>Linux
Journal</em> was
one of those containers—so was every other magazine, newspaper and
broadcast station. Today, those containers are bobbing around in an ocean of
"content" on the Internet. Worse, the stuff inside the containers, which we
used to call "editorial", is now a breed of "content" too.
</p>

<p>
In the old days, editorial lived on one side of a "Chinese wall" between
itself and the publishing side of a newspaper or magazine. The same went for
the programming and advertising sides of a commercial broadcast station or
network. The wall was transparent, meaning it was possible for a writer, a
photographer, a newscaster or a performing artist to see what funded the
operation, but the ethical thing was to ignore what happened on the other
side of that wall. Which was easy to do, because everything on the other
side of that wall was somebody else's job.
</p>

<p>
Today that wall has been destroyed by the imperatives of "content
production", which is the new job of journalists and everybody else devoted
to "generating content" in maximum volumes, all the better to attract
"programmatic" advertising.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By doing only the old-fashioned
kind of advertising that simply sponsors our work and carries no tracking, we're free to
zero-base something different and better than you'll see elsewhere. And that
applies both here inside the magazine and in other media as well, starting
with the website.
</p>

<p>
So far I see three requirements for becoming as good as we want to be.
</p>

<p>
First is featuring great writers you know by name and who you expect to
produce great stuff. [I'm not sure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni_(magazine)"><em>OMNI</em></a>
magazine (1978–1995) was great, but it sure tried hard.
I was part of that, contributing humorous pieces to early issues. When
that failed to become a full-time gig, I did what many other journalists
do when they reach their rope's end: I started an ad agency. That grew
into one of the biggest in Silicon Valley before I got pulled back to
journalism again in the 1990s—by <em>Linux Journal</em>.] We already have some of those in our stable of veteran
contributors, but we want more.
</p>

<p>
Second is by being as fun, practical and authoritative as we can on Linux
topics. A nice model for that, among successful contemporary publications,
is <a href="https://makezine.com"><em>Make</em></a>. We should be for Linux
what <em>Make</em> is for the maker movement.
</p>

<p>
Third is by going deep. I want us to drill down on topics that are important
and relevant to our readers, but not covered elsewhere—or not covered
well enough.
</p>

<p>
As always, we invite guidance from readers toward all of those.
