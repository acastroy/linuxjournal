<h1 class="title">Open Sauce: OpenStreetMap Should Be a Priority for the Open Source
Community</h1>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_18">
Why open source needs an open geographic dataset. By Glyn Moody</h2>

<p>
Open source has won. The fact that free software now dominates
practically every sector of computing (with the main exception of the
desktop) is proof of that. But there is something even more important
than the victory of open source itself, and that is the wider success of
the underlying approach it embodies. People often forget just how radical
the idea of open, collaborative development seemed when it appeared in
the 1990s. Although it is true that this philosophy was the norm in
the very earliest days of the field, that culture was soon forgotten
with the rapid rise of commercial computing, which swept everything
before it in the pursuit of handsome profits. There, a premium was
placed on maintaining trade secrets and of excluding competitors.
But the appearance of GNU and Linux, along with the other open software
projects that followed, provided repeated proof that the older approach
was better for reasons that are obvious upon reflection.
</p>

<p>
Open, collaborative development allows people to build on the work of
others, instead of wastefully re-inventing the wheel, and it enables the best
solutions to be chosen on technical, rather than commercial, grounds.
The ability to work on areas of personal interest, rather than on those
assigned by managers, encourages new talent to join projects in order
to pursue their passions, while the non-discriminatory global reach of
the open method means that the pool of contributors is much larger than
for conventional approaches. However, none of those advantages is tied
to software: they can be applied to many fields. And that is precisely
what has happened in the last two decades, with the ideas underlying
free software producing astonishing results elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Arguably one of the most important knock-on effects of free
software is the open nature of the World Wide Web. In his book, <a href="https://books.google.nl/books/about/Weaving_the_Web.html?id=Unp4PwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"><em>Weaving
the Web</em></a>, Tim Berners-Lee writes that he originally wanted
to release his creation under the GPL and decided in
1993 to place it in the public domain only because key computing
companies indicated that they wouldn't support the original idea.
Also <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/172781">influenced
by Richard Stallman's work</a> is Paul Ginsburg, who set
up <a href="https://arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a> in 1991 as
an open repository of scientific preprints. This idea of
unrestricted sharing of academic knowledge later gave rise to the <a href="https://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/overview.htm">open access</a>
movement. Similarly, the GNU project's concepts and even name <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/09/the-hive/305118/?single_page=true">fed
into Nupedia</a>, the little-known precursor to Wikipedia. The latter's
open collaborative approach has been so successful, it's hard to
imagine modern life without this extraordinary resource.
</p>

<p>
Those are all major projects that are familiar to many people. But
there's <a href="https://blog.osmfoundation.org">another application
of the core ideas of openness and collaboration</a> that is not as well
known as it should be:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
OpenStreetMap is a world-wide collaborative project aiming
at providing free map data, under an open license, to anyone who wants
it. Volunteers all over the planet contribute their local knowledge and
their time to build the best map ever.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
began in 2004. It was inspired by Wikipedia, and
it took off thanks to Linux, as its creator, Steve Case, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/09/for-the-love-of-open-mapping-data">explained
in 2014</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I gave a lot of talks. Linux user groups used to be very
popular—people getting together on a Saturday afternoon to talk about
Linux. They already knew half the story because they knew about open
source and they knew about computers and data. So it wasn't too hard
to explain what OpenStreetMap was doing.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Despite its low profile, OpenStreetMap is arguably one of the most
important projects for the future of free software. The rise of mobile
phones as the primary computing device for billions of people, especially
in developing economies, lends a new importance to location and movement.
Many internet services now offer additional features based on where users
are, where they are going and their relative position to other members
of social networks. Self-driving cars and drones are two rapidly evolving
hardware areas where accurate geographical information is crucial. All of
those things depend upon a map in critical ways, and they require large, detailed
datasets. OpenStreetMap is the only truly global open alternative to
better-known, and much better-funded geodata holdings, such as Google Maps.
</p>

<p>
The current dominance of the latter is a serious problem for free
software—and freedom itself. The data that lies behind Google Maps
is proprietary. Thus, any open-source program that uses Google Maps or
other commercial mapping services is effectively including proprietary
elements in its code. For purists, that is unacceptable in itself.
But even for those with a more pragmatic viewpoint, it means that open
source is dependent on a company for data that can be restricted or
withdrawn at any moment.
</p>

<p>
There is a more subtle problem with using a proprietary dataset. Free
software is inherently about freedom because it allows users to do what
they wish with a program. Proprietary code, by contrast, is under
the control of the company that produced it, which means its users
are subject to any constraints that are built in to the software:
<a href="http://www.code-is-law.org">"Code is law"</a>, as Larry
Lessig famously wrote. It is the same with mapping data and services.
If the dataset and mapping software are proprietary, they come with the
constraints and biases of the company that created them built-in, and
they are impossible to circumvent. This might mean certain businesses are
highlighted in an area because they have paid to be given preference.
Services that help users find optimum routes also may be biased in
socially harmful ways—for example, avoiding districts that the map
provider deems "unsuitable".
</p>

<p>
The lack of a wider appreciation of the importance of OpenStreetMap to
the future of open source is bad enough. But the situation seems
to be even worse if a recent post by a long-time contributor
to the project is correct. Serge Wroclawski worked on the
OpenStreetMap project for around eight years, and he helped set up
<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.us">OpenStreetMap US</a>,
a nonprofit organization dedicated to OpenStreetMap in the
United States. In 2014, he wrote a widely discussed article <a href="https://blog.emacsen.net/blog/2014/01/04/why-the-world-needs-openstreetmap">"Why
the world needs OpenStreetMap"</a>, which explores many
of the points mentioned above in greater detail, and with
greater authority. It's well worth reading, as is his
latest exploration of OpenStreetMap, ominously called <a href="https://blog.emacsen.net/blog/2018/02/16/osm-is-in-trouble">"Why
OpenStreetMap is in Serious Trouble"</a>. As he writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
While I still believe in the goals of OpenStreetMap, I feel
the OpenStreetMap project is currently unable to fulfill that mission
due to poor technical decisions, poor political decisions, and a general
malaise in the project. I'm going to outline in this article what I
think OpenStreetMap has gotten wrong. It's entirely possible that OSM
will reform and address the impediments to its success—and I hope it
does. We need a Free as in Freedom geographic dataset.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Leaving aside the political issues Wroclawski raises, one key point to
emerge from his critical examination of OpenStreetMap's current status is
that there are significant opportunities for the Open Source community to
help take OpenStreetMap to the next level. Assuming Wroclawski's analysis
is correct, there are plenty of ways programmers could help
rectify some of the deficiencies of the project he identifies. In the
process, they could tackle exciting and worthwhile new coding challenges.
It often seems that many of the major free software projects have reached
a slightly boring maturity, with all that this implies for offering
sufficient incentives for people to join. The world of mapping, by
contrast, has the potential to provide ambitious coders with the scope
to make their mark in a new field of interest to billions of users.
</p>

<p>
So far, OpenStreetMap has spawned only a limited range of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap#Software_for_viewing_maps">free
software tools</a>, and it badly needs many new ones if it is to match
proprietary offerings. That's a relatively straightforward task.
Much harder will be creating open versions of online services like <a href="https://www.waze.com">Google's Waze</a><a></a>, which describes itself as
"the world's largest community-based traffic and navigation app". Doing
so will require working with well-funded organizations—perhaps
the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation">Mozilla
Foundation</a>—or with open-source companies like <a href="https://www.canonical.com">Canonical</a>, since the investment
required will be considerable.
</p>

<p>
Although undoubtedly difficult, creating high-quality map-based
services is a challenge that must be tackled by the Open Source
community if it wants to remain relevant in a world dominated by mobile
computing. The bad news is that at the moment, millions of people
are happily <a href="https://www.waze.com/en-GB/about">sending crucial
geodata</a> to proprietary services like Waze, as well as providing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/13/google-maps-spam-fighters.html">free
bug-fixes for Google Maps</a>. Far better if they could be working with
equal enthusiasm and enjoyment on open projects, since the resulting
datasets would be freely available to all, not turned into corporate
property. The good news is that OpenStreetMap provides exactly the
right foundation for creating those open map-based services, which is
why supporting it must become a priority for the Open Source world.
