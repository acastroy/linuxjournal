<h1 class="title">Review: GitStorage</h1>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_13">Petros reviews the GitStorage server appliance, which emphasizes
data privacy and security.</h2>

<p>
By profession, I'm a software developer. Aside from a preferred editor,
what matters most to a developer is the use of a Source Code Manager
(SCM). So, when a new product comes along featuring my favorite SCM,
Git, I had no choice but to spend some time using it.
</p>

    <p class="caption"></p>
  </div>

<p>
GitStorage develops and distributes a Git server appliance of the same
name with an emphasis on data privacy and security. The company produces two
flavors, the key differences being the following:
</p>

<ul><li>
Price: $399 vs. $499.
</li>

<li>
Local storage capacity: 16GB vs. 64GB.
</li>

<li>
Number of users: 10 vs. unlimited.
</li>

<li>
Color: pink vs. blue.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
When I received the product, it was packaged well with everything needed to
hit the ground running: the device, a micro-USB-connected power plug,
mounting screws and a basic set of instructions for connecting to the
local device over Ethernet. All you need to do is connect it to your router or switch,
apply
power to the device, and within a minute, you'll be able to access a
web-based front end to the device's assigned IP address from within
your preferred web browser.
</p>

<p>
On initial connection, you're greeted
with a setup and configuration menu. This setup allows you to configure
the administrator account, generate CA certificates for your web browser,
configure SMTP email relays so you even can connect the device to an existing
Dropbox account for remote synchronization—all of which can be configured
at a later date.
</p>

<p>
<em>The GitStorage
Dashboard</em>
</p>

<p>
When the configuration is complete, you're redirected to the dashboard of a very
intuitive
user interface. And because this is a single-purpose appliance, the
features and functionality presented in the interface are simple and
easy to understand. You can dynamically create or remove users, create new or
remove existing code repositories, and assign the appropriate users to
those repositories. When those same users log in to the web interface,
they will be limited only to the repositories to which they are assigned.
</p>

<p>
<em>A View of
Repositories</em>
</p>

<p>
Again, the device is predominately focused on securing your data and
limiting access to those who are granted it. Data at rest is always
encrypted—that is, it's local to the device, even when synchronized to
the cloud. For instance, if Dropbox is configured as your back-end remote
archive location, a tarball that is GPG-signed will be synchronized to
it. Even if people were to access that Dropbox archive, they will need
a password to decrypt the file and then untar the tarball.
</p>

Archive File to Dropbox</em></p>

<p>
Now, how does GitStorage compare to existing Git solutions?
It simplifies the task of deploying and maintaining your very own
Git servers. You don't need to be a Git expert to get this handy
device up and running and start providing developers the comfort and
security of maintaining their code using the industry's most popular
SCM. Out of the box, it is easy to configure and just works. Also, if very
sensitive source code is pushed to this device, rest assured that your
data at rest always will be encrypted in both local and remote locations.
</p>

<p>
What environments would benefit from this? I see this as a perfect
solution for hobbyists and small-to-medium-sized software
development firms. As long as you don't push too many binary files, the
larger of the two devices (64GB) definitely can last you some
time. And even if it doesn't, you're also able to add more GitStorage
devices to your network.
