Unless you've been living under a rock, you most certainly have heard
of WordPress, one of the most popular blogging platforms around that
also happens to be 100% open source. WordPress <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/wordpress-quietly-powers-27-percent-of-the-web/">powers
27% of the web</a> from personal to corporate to even government sites
(<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/7kw71q/whitehousegov_is_now_on_wordpress/">Whitehouse.gov</a>
for one).
</p>

<p>
In a 2008 interview, <em>Linux Journal</em>'s Katherine Druckman asked
WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg, "You frequently have reiterated your
commitment to open-source ideals and GPL licensing. How has this
commitment factored into the development of your company, Automattic?
How do you use open-source technology to achieve your goals?"
</p>

<p>
Mullenweg responded:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When I set out to create Automattic, it was an
interesting dilemma—in our society, it seemed the best way to have an
impact on the world was working within a for-profit framework, but at
the same time, I'd seen multiple examples of "open-source companies"
suffocating the communities they grew from.
</p>

<p>
I came across an interesting hack though—by keeping WordPress.org a
separate entity from Automattic and basing our business entirely on
GPL code, you create a balance that aligns the fiduciary
responsibilities of the corporation with the interests of the
community at large. In the long term—10, 20 years from now—it
still
will be in the best interest of Automattic to support the broader
community as much as possible, because its own business succeeds when
they do.
</p>

<p>
I didn't want WordPress to be a one-company project, so by separating
out the nonprofit and for-profit sides and making some explicit
decisions about businesses Automattic would never enter, we created a
lot of room for other companies to embrace, support and build on top
of WordPress. Hopefully, we also set a good example of how to
contribute back to the community.
</p>

<p>
It was the best way I could think of to ensure that the principles I
believe in would endure beyond my personal involvement or control of
either organization. (But I still look both ways when crossing the
street.)
</p>

<p>
Congratulations to WordPress for being <em>Linux Journal</em>'s Readers'
Choice.

Thanks to its stability, performance, feature set and a loyal
following, the K Desktop Environment (KDE) won Best
Desktop Environment in this year's <em>Linux Journal</em> Readers' Choice
Awards.
</p>

<p>
<em>Linux Journal</em> reader Larry Coombes says his vote was for KDE for a
mass of reasons, including:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
1) Totally configurable, which is ESSENTIAL for new users who want
their Linux desktop configured to emulate the exact rendering of
Windows (XP or 7) that they have worked on forever. Also, essential
for when the new user turns to me and says, "Can Linux do XYZ?? Can I
make it so...", with KDE, the answer is always "Yes", which is much
better than explaining limitations of a desktop environment and trying
to train someone, because then you hit "But I could always do this in
Windows...".
</p>

<p>
2) I have tried other desktop environments, and none of them come
close to KDE's keyboard-shortcut support, which is ESSENTIAL to my
business. I teach young children, and I am jumping from app to app, file
to file in chaos. With KDE, I can minimize touchpad operation and use a
laptop as a proper, portable device. I have around 50 keyboard
shortcuts to move my work forward—and to be able to use in taxis and
trains!
</p>

<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/weekend-reading-using-python-science-and-machine-learning">Python</a>
wins Best Programming Language again this year in <em>Linux Journal</em>'s
annual Readers' Choice Awards. It's easy to use, powerful and
versatile with a really large and active community. Having that
supportive community ensures that developers of all skill levels
easily can find the support and documentation they require, which feeds
Python's popularity. It certainly helps that Python has something like a
corporate sponsor. Python is recognized as an official language at
Google, running on many of its internal systems and showing up in
many Google APIs. In fact, Google's developer website offers free <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction">Python
classes, videos and exercises</a>.
