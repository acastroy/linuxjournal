FOSS Project Spotlight: CloudMapper, an AWS Visualization Tool</h1>


<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_20">
Duo Security has released CloudMapper, an open-source tool for
visualizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud environments.</h2>

<p>
When working with AWS, it's common to have a number of separate accounts
run by different teams for different projects. Gaining an understanding
of how those accounts are configured is best accomplished by visually
displaying the resources of the account and how those resources can
communicate. This complements a traditional asset inventory.
</p>

<p>
Duo built CloudMapper to generate interactive network diagrams of AWS
accounts and released it as open source on <a href="https://github.com/duo-labs/cloudmapper">Github</a>.
</p>

<p>
See a demo <a href="https://duo-labs.github.io/cloudmapper">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Using CloudMapper, you can quickly answer a number of questions, such as:
</p>

<ul><li>
Which resources are publicly exposed?
</li>

<li>
What resources can communicate internally with which other resources?
</li>

<li>
Do you have a robust architecture in the event of an availability zone
failure?
</li>

<li>
How many regions is this account using? How "big" is this account? How
complex is it?
</li>
</ul>

<p>
CloudMapper allows engineers to double-check their understanding of what
they've built, quickly understand other environments and present that
information to other stakeholders.
</p>


<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_21">
How It Works</h3>

<p>
There are three steps to getting up and running with CloudMapper:
</p>

<ol><li>
Collect information about an AWS account via a shell script that uses
the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli">AWS CLI</a>.
</li>

<li>
Convert that data into a format usable by the web browser.
</li>

<li>
Run a simple web server to view the collected data in your browser.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first step of collecting information only requires the privileges to
describe and list information about an account. This can be done with the
AWS <code>SecurityAudit</code> policy. If you don't have direct access to the
account, someone who does can run this script and send you the bundle of
files it creates.
</p>

<p>
The second step of converting these cached files into something for the
web browser display is where most of the logic is. This is where the
Security Groups are analyzed to determine what network pathways exist,
and parent/child relationships are created between nodes, such as EC2
instances, and compound node structures, such as subnets, availability
zones, VPCs, regions and accounts.
</p>

<p>
The final step of visualizing the data in the browser makes heavy use of
<a href="http://js.cytoscape.org">cytoscape.js</a> to perform the graph layout and allow interaction with the
resources. Historically, this problem would have been solved with
<a href="https://graphviz.gitlab.io">graphviz</a>, but that solution is more suited toward generating static
images as output. Cytoscape originally was created to visualize molecular
interaction networks, but it has been found to be well suited for a variety
of other network visualizations.</p>

<p>
By using cytoscape.js and presenting the diagram to the user in a web
browser, you can click on nodes to get more information about them, move
them around, delete them and more. This is only for visualizing the
data, so any actions you take will not impact your actual AWS
environments.
</p>

<p>
You can zoom in and out, pan, save a high-definition image, or save and
load the layout after you've moved nodes around. You can click on a
compound node, such as a VPC, and compress it to a single node in order
to simplify the visualization. You easily can find and select neighbors,
siblings, children or parent nodes. You can click on edges to get
details about the Security Groups that are allowing that communication to
happen.

Improving the Layout</h3>

<p>
Visualizing large networks is a hard problem. CloudMapper uses the CoSE
(Compound Spring Embedder) layout for Cytoscape.js that was developed by
the i-Vis Lab in Bilkent University, which is regarded as one of the best
algorithms for laying out graphs with compound nodes. However, any graph
with a large number of nodes and edges is inherently complicated. To
manage this problem, CloudMapper has a number of filtering options that
can be used when preparing the data for visualization.
</p>

<p>
Options to reduce the amount of data displayed include:
</p>

<ul><li>
Show only specified regions.</li>

<li>
Ignore internal edges if you want to see only what resources are exposed
publicly.
</li>

<li>
Aggregate similar EC2 instances to a single node based on a tag name.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Even with these techniques and the advanced layout algorithm used, still be
prepared to spend some time rearranging the nodes.
