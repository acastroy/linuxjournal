Tor Hidden Services</h1>

<h2 id="sigil_toc_id_73">
Why should clients get all the privacy? Give your servers some
privacy too! By Kyle Rankin</h2>

<p>
When people write privacy guides, for the most part they are written from
the perspective of the client. Whether you are using HTTPS, blocking
tracking cookies or going so far as to browse the internet over Tor,
those privacy guides focus on helping end users protect themselves
from the potentially malicious and spying web. Since many people who
read <em>Linux Journal</em> sit on the other side of that equation—they run the
servers that host those privacy-defeating services—system administrators also
should step up and do their part to help user privacy. Although part of that just
means making sure your services support TLS, in this article, I describe
how to go one step further and make it possible for your
users to use your services completely anonymously via Tor hidden services.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_74">
How It Works</h3>

<p>
I'm not going to dive into the details of how Tor itself works
so you can use the web anonymously—for those details, check out
<a href="https://tor.eff.org">https://tor.eff.org</a>. Tor hidden services work within the Tor network and
allow you to register an internal, Tor-only service that gets its own
.onion hostname. When visitors connect to the Tor network, Tor resolves
those .onion addresses and directs you to the anonymous service sitting
behind that name. Unlike with other services though, hidden services
provide two-way anonymity. The server doesn't know the IP of the client,
like with any service you access over Tor, but the client also doesn't
know the IP of the server. This provides the ultimate in privacy since
it's being protected on both sides.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_75">
Warnings and Planning</h3>

<p>
As with setting up a Tor node itself, some
planning is involved if you want to set up a Tor hidden service
so you don't defeat Tor's anonymity via some operational
mistake. There are a lot of rules both from an operational
and security standpoint, so I recommend you read this <a href="https://riseup.net/en/security/network-security/tor/onionservices-best-practices">excellent
guide</a> 
to find the latest best practices all in one place.
</p>

<p>
Without diving into all of those steps, I do want to list a few general-purpose
guidelines here. First, you'll want to make sure that whatever
service you are hosting is listening only on localhost (127.0.0.1) and
isn't viewable via the regular internet. Otherwise, someone may be able
to correlate your hidden service with the public one. Next, go through
whatever service you are running and try to scrub specific identifying
information from it. That means if you are hosting a web service, modify
your web server so it doesn't report its software type or version, and
if you are running a dynamic site, make sure whatever web applications
you use don't report their versions either.
</p>

<p>
Some services need to talk to the internet to resolve DNS names or
download other resources. It's important that you configure your service
so that all of those external requests route over Tor. You can do this
with iptables rules that force all of your traffic through a local Tor
proxy like you would for a client, or if your service has SOCKS proxy
support, you can configure it to use the built-in Tor SOCKS proxy.
</p>

<p>
Finally, although you can run a hidden service and a relay node from the
same host, it's considered a best practice to keep them separated so
you can't correlate a hidden service with a particular relay node. Plus,
this means you can just run a hidden service without worrying about any
risks involved in running a relay node.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_76">
How to Configure a Hidden Service</h3>

<p>
The first step in configuring a hidden service is to install Tor. Tor
should be packaged for most major distributions, so you can just use your
package manager to pull down the latest version. If you like to do things
the hard way, or want to make absolutely sure to get the latest version,
you also could sidestep your package manager and build Tor from sources
on <a href="https://torproject.org">https://torproject.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
You will configure your hidden services the same way whether you use a
Red Hat or Debian-based distribution via the /etc/tor/torrc configuration
file. As you'll see, the configuration is nice and simple.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_77">
Hidden HTTP Service</h3>

<p>
For starters, let's assume you want to host a web service. Make sure that
you configure your web server so that it's only listening on localhost
(127.0.0.1), so as not to leak data that may make it easier to correlate
your hidden service with a public service. Next, add the following two
lines to your /etc/tor/torrc:

</p>
<pre><code>
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/http
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Now restart the Tor service (<code>sudo systemctl restart tor</code>), and your
service will be ready. That wasn't so bad, right? The <code>HiddenServiceDir</code> option
will tell you where Tor should store information about this service
(including its .onion address). The <code>HiddenServicePort</code> option tells Tor
on which port it should listen for the hidden service (80 in this case)
and to which address to forward that traffic (127.0.0.1:80 for this example).
</p>

<p>
Once the service has started, you will notice two different files under
/var/lib/tor/hidden_service/http: a "private_key" and a "hostname"
file. The private_key file is used to authenticate this particular
hidden service. It's important that you protect this file, because anyone
who has a copy of it can impersonate your service. The hostname file
contains the name for your hidden service:

</p>
<pre><code>
$ sudo cat /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/http/hostname
o9asojd8aymqqtoa.onion
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
This .onion hostname is what visitors to your service would enter
into their Tor browser to visit you. Note that you're hosting HTTP and
not HTTPS here. HTTPS requires you to get a valid certificate for
f27sojd8aymqqtwa.onion, which wouldn't be possible. In any case, Tor takes
care of authenticating and encrypting your communication to the site, and
you can think of that private_key file as acting kind of like a private
TLS key.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_78">
Adding Additional Services</h3>

<p>
You can host multiple hidden services from one server, and Tor allows
you to set it up in multiple ways. If you want the same hostname to host
multiple services, simply add extra <code>HiddenServicePort</code> directives under
the same <code>HiddenServiceDir</code>. So for instance, if I wanted to add SSH to my
existing HTTP service, I'd do this:

</p>
<pre><code>
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/http
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
In reality though, you probably will want to segregate different services
into their own .onion addresses—that way you have the option of splitting
them up in the future by copying their particular directory under
/var/lib/tor/hidden_service to a new server along with their configuration
settings. To do that, give each service its own HiddenServiceDir option:

</p>
<pre><code>
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/http
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/ssh
HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22
</code>
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>
Now you can look at /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/ssh/hostname to find
the new .onion address for your SSH service.
</p>

<h3 id="sigil_toc_id_79">
Conclusion</h3>

<p>
As you can see, configuring Tor hidden services isn't nearly as difficult
as you might have originally assumed. Arguably, it will take longer for
you to reconfigure your services to listen on localhost than it will to
configure Tor itself!
