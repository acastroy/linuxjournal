Soekris Engineering, Inc.'s lan1841</h2></div></div><p>
The US-manufactured lan1841 from Soekris Engineering, Inc., is a short
standard-profile PCI Express board featuring four independent Intel 82574L
Gigabit Ethernet controllers for systems where the highest number of ports is
required. The lan1841 is designed to work either with the Soekris net6501 for
communications applications or as a standalone PCI Express LAN card. Together
with the Soekris' net6501 series featuring a 1U 19" rackmount case, the
net6501 PCI-Express riser and two lan1841s, users can configure a reliable,
low-power rackmount unit with 12 ports. Alternatively, those looking for a
four-port PCI Express Gigabit LAN card at a reasonable price for use with
other hardware will find their needs met as well. The lan1841 features a
three-year warranty.

OpenERP 7.0</h2></div></div><p>

stunning user interface&rdquo;. OpenERP 7.0 comes with new modules including
touchscreen POS, contract management, fleet management apps, LinkedIn and
Google docs integration, social collaboration between apps as an alternative
to traditional e-mail, innovative kanban views to manage sales pipeline and
projects, and an integrated customer portal, among others. The portal includes
hundreds of modules developed by the community. OpenERP 7.0. is available

Ben Simonds' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blender Master Class</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
The miracle that is open-source has given us stunningly powerful free software
like the Blender 3-D graphics tool. Harness the power of Blender with the new
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Blender Master Class: A Hands-On Guide to Modeling, Sculpting, Materials,
and Rendering</em></span> by 3-D artist and animator Ben Simonds. Simonds' goal
with <span   class="emphasis"><em>Master
Class</em></span>, which is filled with eye-grabbing full-color artwork, is to inspire and
equip new users to create their own masterpieces. Simonds walks readers
through three complete projects: a muscle-bound gargoyle, a futuristic robotic
spider and ancient temple ruins overgrown with jungle. In the process, readers
master the Blender interface and learn how to model and sculpt amazing models.
Other topics include working with reference and concept art in Blender and
GIMP, utilizing textures from GIMP, mastering the art of creating materials
and lighting for scenes and rendering and compositing images to create
striking images.

AcousticSheep's Bluetooth SleepPhones Wireless</h2></div></div><p>
Counting sheep to get to sleep has never been so pass&eacute; with the release of
AcousticSheep LLC's Bluetooth SleepPhones Wireless, the company's latest
addition to its line of doctor-designed miniature headphones integrated into
comfortable, washable sports-style headbands. AcousticSheep assures
users of SleepPhones that they will &ldquo;fall asleep faster and
drug-free&rdquo;
while using the product. Although AcousticSheep already offers similar wired
products without hard earbuds not only for sleeping but also for exercising,
this new product eliminates cords entirely by playing back media from
any Bluetooth-enabled device. SleepPhones Wireless was selected as an
Innovations Award Honoree from the Consumer Electronics Association in advance
of CES 2013.

Velocity Micro's Cruz D610 and Cruz Q610</h2></div></div><p>
Hardware-maker Velocity Micro's design philosophy is to provide products that
are &ldquo;aesthetically pleasing, blazingly fast, competitively priced and
designed and built in the USA&rdquo;. Although Velocity has yet to add &ldquo;powered

Q610, affordable Android 4.1 tablets powered by dual-core and quad-core ARM
processors, respectively. Both devices feature a 10" capacitive touchscreen, camera (D610 front-facing, Q610 front- and rear-facing), Google Play,

Carlos Sessa's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Android Hacks</em></span> (Manning)</h2></div></div><p>
News from the DIY Android desk is the availability of Carlos Sessa's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Android
Hacks</em></span>, a new Manning Publications book of 50 short and simple programming
hacks that are destined to &ldquo;save you time, stretch your skills and maybe
even make you smile&rdquo;. The 50 &ldquo;little gems&rdquo; are organized into categories
such as Layout, Animation, Patterns and UX, and each covers just a few pages,
including annotated source code. Some examples of the hacks include creating
a wizard form using a Gallery, using Scala inside Android, adding an MP3 to
the Media ContentProvider and batching database operations. Most hacks work
with Android 2.x and greater.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux</h2></div></div><p>
The tried-and-true Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) open-source enterprise
platform recently was upgraded to version 6.4. The new release, which
continues in RHEL's tradition of delivering technology that is tested and
stable, includes updates to the platform's existing feature set and provides
new functionality in the areas of identity management, filesystem,
virtualization, storage and productivity tools. Identity management is
improved via SSSD enhancements that strengthen the interoperability experience
with Microsoft Active Directory. Filesystem enhancements from pNFS deliver
performance improvements with the addition of Direct I/O for faster data
access. Virtualization is more robust, thanks to the inclusion of the Microsoft
Hyper-V Linux drivers and other improvements. Storage management is now easier
thanks to new system log features that simplify the process of locating
specific devices. Productivity-tool upgrades include interoperability
improvements with Microsoft Exchange, calendar support in Evolution and support
for newer Wacom tablets.

JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA</h2></div></div><p>
The headlining new feature in IntelliJ IDEA 12, the latest volume of
JetBrains' Java IDE for Web, enterprise and mobile development, is a
brand-new, much faster compiler. JetBrains says that it pulled out all the
stops,
rebuilding the compiler from the ground up and moving it to a separate
process. The result is that projects can be compiled automatically in the
background on every change a developer makes, so that it can run it almost
instantly any time. IntelliJ IDEA also embraces the latest versions of Java,
including its previews and new features that every developer is eager to try.
With v.12, JDK 8 already can be enjoyed with code assistance for new syntax,
such as lambda expressions, method references and default methods. Also in
the new edition, support for Android is expanded with a new Android UI
designer. Aesthetically speaking, IntelliJ IDEA 12 explores the &ldquo;darker
side&rdquo;
of productive coding by unveiling a stylish new dark look and feel, dubbed
&ldquo;Darcula&rdquo;. JetBrains says that Darcula makes the interface clearer and
more functional, minimizing distraction so users can focus more on the
code and less on the IDE.
