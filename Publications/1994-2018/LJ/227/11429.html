Breaking away from JavaScript for a fresh perspective on Web app design. 
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e1f580.0x1f172a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
JavaScript has had a long-standing monopoly on client-side Web programming. 
It has a tremendously large user base, and countless libraries have been written in it. 
Surely it is the perfect language with no flaws at all! Unfortunately, 
that is simply not the case. JavaScript is not without its problems, and there 
exists a large number of libraries and &ldquo;trans-pilers&rdquo; that attempt to work 
around JavaScript's more quirky behaviors. JQuery, Coffeescript, Objective-J 
and RubyJS are examples of how people have been trying to make JavaScript 
better. However, a new contender is throwing its hat into the ring in a big
way.
</p><p>
In comes Google Dart, a new JavaScript replacement language. Dart is a ground-up re-imagining of what JavaScript should
be. It requires its own runtime 
environment (which Google makes available for free under the three-clause BSD 
license) and has its own syntax and libraries. Dart is an object-orientated 
language with a heavy Java-like feel, but it maintains many of the loved 
JavaScript paradigms like first-class functions.
</p><p>
So, why have I chosen to use Dart? Good question! I have chosen Dart because 
it is a clean break from JavaScript, and it has the object-orientated programming 
style I have come to know and love. Because I have a Java background, the 
learning curve didn't seem as steep with Dart as it does with JavaScript. 
Also, because Dart is so new, it gives me a chance to become an early adopter 
of the language and watch its evolution.

Installing Dart</h2></div></div><p>
Before you can program with Dart, you need to grab a copy from 
<a href="http://dartlang.org" target="_self">dartlang.org</a>. I chose to install only the SDK; however, there is an
option to grab the full Dart integrated development environment with the SDK
included. Eclipse users will feel right at home with the IDE, because it is based
on Eclipse components.
</p><p>
To install the SDK, I just unzipped the files and copied the whole directory to 
$HOME/bin. Then I modified my path variable to look in the folder I created:

<pre     class="programlisting">
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/dart-sdk/bin 
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I can run dart, dart2js and dartdoc from anywhere.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e1f580.0x1f17828"></a>
Language Features</h2></div></div><p>
The core Dart language is pretty straightforward. The basic data types 
available are var (stores any object), num (stores any number type), int, 
double, String, bool, List (arrays) and Map (associative array). All of 
these data types are declared in the dart:core library. dart:core is
always available and does not need to be imported. Functions also can be 
considered a data type, because Dart treats them as first-class objects. 
You can assign functions to variables and pass them as parameters to other 
functions or write anonymous functions in-line. 
</p><p>
For flow control, you have the &ldquo;usual&rdquo; if, else if, else, for, while and 
do-while loops, break, continue, switch and assert. Exceptions are handled 
through try-catch blocks. 
</p><p>
Dart has a lot of support for object-oriented programming. Classes are 
defined with the class keyword. Every object is an instance of some class,
and all classes descend from the Object type. Dart allows only for 
single inheritance. The extends keyword is used to inherit from a parent class
other than Object. Abstract classes can be used to define an interface with 
some default implementation. They cannot be instantiated directly, but can 
make use of factory constructors to create the appearance of direct 
instantiation. Abstract classes are defined with the abstract modifier in 
front of the class declaration. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e1f580.0x1f17a38"></a>
Standard Library</h2></div></div><p>
Dart ships with an impressive standard library. I use a few
of the libraries and classes in my examples here, so it will be helpful to 
have an idea of what they can do ahead of time. I can't cover all of 
them, but I cover the ones I personally find most useful. 
</p><p>
As I said earlier, dart:core defines all of the core data types 
that are available. That's not all though! dart:core also contains the 
regular expression classes that are an invaluable addition to any standard 
library. Dart uses the same regular expression syntax as JavaScript.
</p><p>
dart:io provides classes that let your program reach out to the world. 
The File and Directory classes can be used to interact with the local filesystem. 
The File class also will allow you to open input and output streams on the 
specific file. If you want to write cross-platform code and allow 
users to specify the path of a file native to their operating system, the 
Path class provides a really nice Path.fromNative(String path) constructor that 
will convert Windows and UNIX paths to their Dart counterparts. Also included 
in this library are the Socket and ServerSocket classes that can be used for 
traditional network communications. The HttpServer class allows you to
program a Web server quickly. This is great if you want to add a custom
rest API to your application. dart:io can be imported and used only on 
server-side applications, so don't try to use it in your browser apps!
</p><p>
dart:html contains all of the classes necessary to interact with a client 
browser's document object model. This library is required to write any 
client-side code that runs in a browser. The library defines two static 
methods: Element query(String selector) and 
List&lt;Element&gt; queryAll(String selector). These methods allow you to grab
HTML5 elements from the browser's DOM using cascading-stylesheet selectors. 
(I show an example of this later.)
</p><p>
dart:math, dart:json and dart:crypto provide helpers that are hard to 
live without. dart:math provides all of the static math methods that
programmers have come to expect. dart:json provides the JSON helper class.
It has only three static methods: parse(String json), which returns a Map 
containing the parsed document; String stringify(Object object) and
void printOn(Object object, StringBuffer output) can be 
used to serialize an object into JSON. Any object can be made serializable 
by implementing a toJson() method. dart:crypto has helpers for performing
md5, sha1 and sha256 hashing. There also is a CryptoUtils class with methods
for converting bytes to hex and bytes to base64. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e1f580.0x1f17ca0"></a>
Server-Side Programming</h2></div></div><p>
Let's jump into Dart by looking at some server-side programming:

<pre     class="programlisting">
import 'dart:io';

void main(){
  String fileName = './test.txt';
  File file = new File(fileName);

  var out = file.openOutputStream();
  out.writeString("Hello, Dart!\n");
  out.close();
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Does it look pretty familiar? It's not much different from a Java program at this point. 
You start by importing the dart:io library. This gives you access to the File and 
OutputStream classes. Next, you declare a main method. Just like Java and C, main 
acts as the entry point for all programs. The File object is used to hold a 
reference to a single file on the filesystem. In order to write to this file, 
you open the file's output stream. This method will create the file if it does 
not exist or clears the contents of the file if it does. It returns an 
OutputStream object that then can be used to send data to the file. You write 
a single string and close the OutputStream.
</p><p>
To run this program, save it to a file called first.dart. Then use the 
Dart runtime environment provided with the SDK:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dart first.dart
</pre>
</p><p>
When your program is done, you should see a file called test.txt in the same 
directory. Open it, and you will see your text.
</p><p>
What's interesting about Dart is that all I/O is event-based. This is much in 
the same style as Node.js. Every time you call a method that performs I/O, it 
is added to the event queue and the method returns immediately. Almost every 
single I/O method takes in a callback function or returns a Future object. 
The reason for this design choice is for scalability. Because Dart runs your 
code in a single thread, non-blocking asynchronous I/O calls are the only way 
to allow the software to scale to hundreds or even thousands of users.

  List jsonData = [];
  String apiKey = "";
  String zipcode = "";
  
  //Read the user supplied data form the options

    zipcode = new Options().arguments[1];

    exit(1);

  //Build the URI we are going to request data from
  Uri uri = new Uri("http://api.wunderground.com/"
      "api/${apiKey}/conditions/q/${zipcode}.json");

  HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
  HttpClientConnection connection = 
                           client.getUrl(uri);
  connection.onResponse = 
                  (HttpClientResponse response) {
  
    //Our client has a response, open an input 
    //stream to read it
    InputStream stream = response.inputStream;
    stream.onData = () {
    
      //The input stream has data to read, 
      //read it and add it to our list
      jsonData.addAll(stream.read());
    };

    stream.onClosed = () {

      //response and print the location and temp.
      try {
        Map jsonDocument = 
         JSON.parse(new String.fromCharCodes(jsonData));
        if (jsonDocument["response"].containsKey("error")){
          throw jsonDocument["response"]["error"]["description"];
        }
        String temp = 
        &#8618;jsonDocument["current_observation"]["temperature_string"];
        String location = jsonDocument["current_observation"]
          ["display_location"]["full"];
        
        print('The temperature for $location is $temp');
      } catch(e) {
        print("Error: $e");
        exit(2);
      }
    };
  
    //Register the error handler for the InputStream
    stream.onError = () {
      print("Stream Failure!");
      exit(3);
    };
  };
  
  //Register the error handler for the HttpClientConnection
  connection.onError = (e){
    print("Http error (check api key)");
    print("$e");
    exit(4);
  };
}
</pre></div><p>
In Listing 1, you can see this evented I/O style put to work with the
<tt  >HttpClientConnection</tt> object returned by the
<tt  >HttpClient.getUrl(Uri url)</tt>
method. This object is working in the background waiting for a response 
from the HTTP server. In order to know when the response has been received,
you must register an <tt  >onResponse(HttpClientResponse
response)</tt> callback method. 
I created an anonymous method to handle this. Also notice that toward the 
bottom of the program, I register an <tt  >onError()</tt> callback
as well. Don't worry;
all of the callbacks are registered before the HTTP transaction begins.
</p><p>
Once the <tt  >onResponse()</tt> callback is executed, I pull the InputStream object 
out of the response to begin reading data. I register the
<tt  >onData()</tt>,
<tt  >onClosed()</tt> and <tt  >onError()</tt> callbacks to handle the different states the 
InputStream can be in. <tt  >onData()</tt> simply reads bytes off the stream and 
appends them to the jsonData list object. <tt  >onData()</tt> is guaranteed to be called as 
long as there is data to read. Once the stream has hit &ldquo;end of
file&rdquo;, 
<tt  >onClosed()</tt> is executed. At this point, I know all of the data from the 
HttpRequest has been transferred and read, so I can use the JSON helper class 
to parse the response into a Map object and print the final result to the user. 
This is where the program actually exits from if everything was successful. If 
there was an error in the InputStream, then the
<tt  >onError()</tt> callback would have 
been called, and the program would have exited from there.
</p><p>
To run this program, call it with the Dart runtime environment. You will need to
register for an API key from Weather Underground (<a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api" target="_self">www.wunderground.com/weather/api</a>).
Don't worry; it's completely free. Once you have your API key, you can check the
current temperature for any US zip code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dart wunder.dart ec7....93b 10001
The temperature for New York, NY is 57.2 F (14.0 C)

Client-Side Dart</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you've seen what Dart can do on the server side, let's take a 
look at what it really was designed for, the client side. Dart excels
at programming large-scale browser applications. Unfortunately, space 
constraints prevent me from showing a truly large application. 
Instead, I cover a not-so-large but very cool application using
the HTML5 Canvas object. Let's use Dart for finger painting.

In our simple finger-painting application, there will be buttons for each color
that is available to users, as well as buttons to increment and decrement the
thickness of their strokes. What good is painting a masterpiece if you can't
save it and share it with the world? So, let's make a save button that will
convert the canvas to a PNG image.
</p><p>
First, let's take a look at the markup for this project. In Listing 3, you
can see there is an HTML5 Web page that contains a canvas element called
<tt  >draw-surface</tt>. This is where the work of art will be made. Below the
canvas are the control buttons that allow users to select colors and
stroke width, and the save button. The last part of the document is
the most interesting part. There are two script elements. The first is
a script tag with the type attribute set to &ldquo;application/dart&rdquo;. This
script type is currently recognized only by a fork of Chromium called
Dartium (<a href="http://www.dartlang.org/dartium" target="_self">www.dartlang.org/dartium</a>). The second is a JavaScript
bootstrap file that is required to start the Dart VM in Dartium. It also
has a special second function that I talk about later.
</p><p>
Now let's take a look at the application itself. At the top of Listing 2, I start
the program by importing dart:html. All client-side applications must import
this library to have access to the DOM. Next, I create a class called DrawSurface
that will act as a container class for the canvas object. The constructor takes
in a CanvasElement and grabs its 2-D-rendering context. It also registers all of
the callbacks to handle mouse movements on the draw surface. When the user
presses down on the mouse, somewhere on the draw surface canvas I begin a draw
path.
</p><p>
As the user moves the mouse around with the button pressed down, I add
line segments to the drawing. When the user releases the mouse or moves
out of the canvas element, I close the drawing path.
</p><p>
I implemented getters and setters for the color and lineThickness
attributes. In the setter methods, I make sure to update the rendering
context on any change. I also add two methods <tt  >incrementLineThickness(int
amount)</tt> that will allow the user to adjust the lineThickness by some
amount, instead of just setting it, and
<tt  >getPNGImageUrl()</tt> to expose the
canvas element's <tt  >toDataUrl()</tt> method. This method will allow the save
button to function.
</p><p>
In main, I use the static <tt  >query(String selector)</tt> function to get the canvas
element by its ID. The query function takes any CSS selector and returns
an Element object that matches it. If there is more than one element that
you want to access on a page, you can use the <tt  >queryAll(String
selector)</tt> function
that will return a List&lt;Element&gt; object. I use this function to gather up all
of the color buttons at once and register onClick() events to set the current
color to its respective ID value.
</p><p>
Finally, I register the callbacks for the size-up and size-down buttons that
change the thickness of the line by 1. I also register the callback for the 
save button to grab the PNG data URL from the canvas and open it in a new
window. The user then can save the image by right-clicking on it and choosing
&ldquo;save image as&rdquo;.

Running the Application</h2></div></div><p>
If you have chosen to download and install the full Dart editor
package, you already have Dartium installed. If, like me, you chose
to install only the SDK, you need to grab a copy of Dartium from
<a href="http://www.dartlang.org/dartium" target="_self">www.dartlang.org/dartium</a>. To install it, I just unzipped
the file and created a symlink in my $HOME/bin directory to the chrome
program that I extracted:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ln -s /path/to/unzipped/folder/chrome dartium
</pre>
</p><p>
Once it is installed, you can run this application from the command line with 
the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dartium fingerpaint.html
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e1f580.0x22245e0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Dartium is an experimental browser, so it should be used only for developing
Dart applications locally. Don't use it as your normal browser! There might
be security exploits or stability issues that have not been discovered yet.

Running on Other Browsers</h2></div></div><p>
It's okay if you don't have Dartium. Remember that bootstrap script line in 
fingerpain.html? Aside from starting the Dart VM in Dartium, it also 
will fall back to a JavaScript application if Dart is not supported. The JavaScript
application must have the same name as the Dart application with the extension
.dart.js. The Dart SDK comes with a nifty program called dart2js that will convert 
a Dart browser application into a JavaScript application for use in any
browser.
To convert this application, you can run <tt  >dart2js</tt> on
fingerpaint.dart: 

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ dart2js -ofingerpaint.dart.js fingerpaint.dart
</pre>
</p><p>
When this is done, you will see several new files, including fingerpaint.dart.js.
</p><p>
Now the application will work in any browser that can handle JavaScript. I
personally recommend using Dartium for application development and then
converting the application to JavaScript for release.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11429f2.large.jpg"><img src="11429f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. After being converted to JavaScript, the finger-paint application can
now run on any browser. Here it is running on Firefox.

State of Dart</h2></div></div><p>
I would love to tell you that the community has welcomed Dart with open arms,
but that's simply not the case. The people in charge are afraid of
Dart becoming the next VBScript and hurting the open Web. So far,
Microsoft, Mozilla and Apple have rejected the idea of embedding a Dart 
runtime into their browsers. As Dart matures and gains popularity, I hope to
see this stance reverse, but for now, dart2js is the only way to get Dart
projects on-line for all to use.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Dart is a fantastic language that presents an entirely new approach to writing
large-scale, client-side, object-oriented applications. I have enjoyed working with
it, and I hope you will too. The potential of this language is limitless, and I hope 
to see wide-spread adoption of it in the future.
