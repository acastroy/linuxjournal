Test your Web applications by controlling real browsers from Ruby.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xec2580.0xfba3b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I recently was visiting a new client when one of the staff developers
asked me to help debug his automated test suite. I asked what test
frameworks he used, and he responded by saying, &ldquo;Cucumber and
Watir&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Now, I've long known about Cucumber, and I even wrote about it several
years ago in this column. It's an advanced acceptance-testing
framework that's especially popular among Rubyists who promote
behavior-driven development (BDD), an offshoot of test-driven
development (TDD), which looks at a system's functionality from the
end user's perspective. Cucumber allows you to describe your
tests in plain English, which makes the test specifications easy to
understand, even for nontechnical users.
</p><p>
But Watir? I knew that Watir (Web Application Testing In Ruby,
pronounced &ldquo;water&rdquo;) is a BSD-licensed framework that lets you interact
with a Web browser from within a Ruby program, allowing you to test
with a real browser (like the macro-based, cross-platform Selenium
test tool) but with Ruby commands (like the popular Capybara test
tool). I had last looked at Watir more than four years ago, at which
time it had a fatal flaw: it worked only on Windows systems and only
with Internet Explorer.
</p><p>
But it seems that in the past few years, Watir has grown and expanded,
with a suite of software projects and products that are increasingly
flexible and impressive in their scope, handling many different types
of browsers, operating systems and conditions.
</p><p>
In this article, I take a look at Watir and how you can use it to test
your Web applications more easily. My client's test suite, implemented
with Watir, really impressed me, and it showed how with a bit of
cleverness, you can take advantage of Watir's platform-independence to
ensure that your application works on different browsers and operating
systems with a minimum of hassle&mdash;and without having to worry if the
JavaScript emulation package you're using will reflect the
version that's in a user's browser accurately.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xec2580.0xfba778"></a>
Installing Watir</h2></div></div><p>
One of the confusing things about Watir is that it's the name of one
particular open-source project, as well as a set of related projects
that have the &ldquo;watir&rdquo; name in them. Each project has slightly
different capabilities and dependencies, and is maintained by a
different person or group.
</p><p>
Moreover, although documentation for Watir certainly exists, it's not
nearly as centralized, organized or easy to follow as many other
open-source projects that have reached this maturity level.
Understanding how to use Watir frequently requires that you understand
the general world of Web browsers and automatic testing frameworks in
order to work with it, and that you figure out which version of Watir
will do what you want.
</p><p>
For example, as I mentioned previously, Watir originally worked only on
Windows and IE. This remains true for the &ldquo;watir&rdquo; system itself, also
known as &ldquo;watir-classic&rdquo;.
</p><p>
You can use Watir on non-Windows machines by using Webdriver&mdash;part of
Selenium, an Apache-licensed Web application testing framework. Just
in case you missed that part, let me repeat it: Watir's cross-platform
capabilities are made possible by Webdriver, which is developed by the
maintainers of the &ldquo;competing&rdquo; Selenium test automation system.
</p><p>
(Wait, did I say that Webdriver is an open-source product? It is, but
it's also a draft specification API from the W3C, the reference
implementation of which is, you guessed it, the Webdriver software in
the Selenium project.)
</p><p>
Because Selenium is widely used and well maintained, and because the
Selenium team wants to have connections from many languages and to
many browsers, it's generally safe to assume that you can control just
about any Web browser programmatically using Webdriver. The Watir
community has taken advantage of this, creating the watir-webdriver
gem&mdash;basically, connecting the Watir API to the Webdriver back end.
Of course, there are exceptions; I recently found that watir-webdriver
did not yet support the just-released Firefox 19. A quick check on
Freenode IRC's #watir channel confirmed that Webdriver doesn't yet
support the most-recent Firefox version.
</p><p>
The bottom line is that for virtually any work you'll want to do
on a Linux system, you'll need to install the watir-webdriver gem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo gem install watir-webdriver -V
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have installed watir-webdriver, you can work with Chrome and
Firefox. Actually, that's not entirely true. You'll also need to
install chromedriver, a program that lets you control Chrome via
Webdriver (see Resources for the download URL).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xec2580.0xfbacf8"></a>
Watir Basics</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have installed Watir, things should be much easier and more
exciting. Fire up an interactive Ruby shell, either using IRB or the
more modern Pry. If you're running Ruby 1.8, you first need
to load the Ruby gems package:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; require 'rubygems'
</pre>
</p><p>
And in all cases, you then need to load the watir library:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; require 'watir'
</pre>
</p><p>
Now I'm going to create an instance of Watir::Browser, the class that
represents a Web browser, which I can control via Ruby. I do this
by passing the &ldquo;new&rdquo; constructor method a parameter indicating which
kind of browser I want. For example, I can create a Chrome browser:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser = Watir::Browser.new :chrome
</pre>
</p><p>
In my case, this takes a little while to execute, as the browser
binary starts up and then opens a communication channel, via Webdriver
and Watir, with my Ruby instance. I often like to use the &ldquo;inspect&rdquo;
method on a Ruby object to examine it. Here's what I get when I do
this with my browser:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; print browser.inspect
#&lt;Watir::Browser:0x1b4e74e97c5b6930 url="about:blank" 
 &#8618;title="about:blank"&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
Not surprisingly, my browser instance has both a current URL and a
title, neither of which is particularly exciting. So, let's point
the browser to somewhere that's a bit more interesting:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.goto 'http://linuxjournal.com'
</pre>
</p><p>
Within a few moments, I not only get control back at my interactive
Ruby prompt, but the Web browser also has gone to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> home page. I can
ask the browser for its title with the &ldquo;title&rdquo; method:


<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.title
=&gt; "Linux Journal | The Original Magazine of the Linux Community"
</pre>
</p><p>
I similarly can invoke the &ldquo;url&rdquo; method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.url
=&gt; "http://www.linuxjournal.com/"
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that although I told the browser to go to
http://linuxjournal.com, it was redirected to
http://www.linuxjournal.com, and the browser's current URL
reflects this.
</p><p>
At this point, I can use the &ldquo;html&rdquo; method to get the HTML from the
current browser window or the &ldquo;text&rdquo; method to retrieve a version of
the current browser, stripped of HTML tags. I also can go to the
previous page (with the &ldquo;back&rdquo; method) or reload the current page
(with the &ldquo;refresh&rdquo; method).
</p><p>
Now, let's say that I want to retrieve all of the headlines from the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> site. From a quick inspection of the site, I can see that each
headline is in an &ldquo;h2&rdquo; tag. I can ask Watir to retrieve all of the
&ldquo;h2&rdquo; tags in a collection, from which I then can display the first
headline's text. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.h2s[2].text
=&gt; "Kyle Rankin to Keynote SCALE 11x"
</pre>
</p><p>
But why stop there? I can retrieve and display all of the current
headlines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.h2s.each {|h| puts h.text}
</pre>
</p><p>
I'm not going to use up all of my column with a list of headlines, but
you can be sure that this does print all of the headlines on the site.
Actually, it does a little more than that. The above code prints all of
the h2 tags anywhere in the site, which includes a bit more than that.
Upon closer inspection, I don't really want all of the h2 tags on this
page, but rather all of the h2 tags that are within the div whose name
is &ldquo;content-area&rdquo;.
</p><p>
So, what I need to do is tell Watir to grab the &ldquo;content-area&rdquo; div and
then retrieve all of the h2s contained within it. To grab the
content-area div, I use the &ldquo;div&rdquo; method, which tags a hash describing
the attributes of the div I want:

<pre     class="programlisting">
browser.div(id: 'content-area')
</pre>
</p><p>
That returns the div, which is a good start. But I want the h2s
within the div, so I can just say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
browser.div(id: 'content-area').h2s
</pre>
</p><p>
Yes, the &ldquo;h2s&rdquo; method that I used before, when executed within the
context of a div, restricts the search to that div, rather than the
entire browser window. So, I can display all of the latest
headlines with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
browser.div(id: 'content-area').h2s.each {|h| puts h.text}
</pre>
</p><p>
And sure enough, that works very nicely. Watir provides methods for
you to retrieve many different types of elements from within the full
browser context, or within a more restrictive context. Thus, you can 
find a single div with the singular &ldquo;div&rdquo; method or a number of them
matching (optional) criteria with the plural &ldquo;divs&rdquo; method. You can
retrieve the first h2, or the first h2 to match optional criteria,
with the &ldquo;h2&rdquo; method, or all of the h2s that match optional criteria
with the plural &ldquo;h2s&rdquo; method. The same is true for
&ldquo;span&rdquo;, &ldquo;h3&rdquo;, &ldquo;p&rdquo;
and even &ldquo;a&rdquo; tags. The singular method retrieves the first item to
match your stated criteria, or if multiple elements matched, the first
from that list.
</p><p>
Watir provides a number of tricks that let you find and work with Web
pages. For example, I can search for all paragraphs whose text
is the word &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.ps(text: 'Linux').count
</pre>
</p><p>
Not surprisingly, this returns a value of 0, because no paragraph
consists solely of the word &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;. However, if I pass a regexp
object rather than a string, I'll get back the &ldquo;p&rdquo; elements that
contain the word &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; anywhere inside them:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.ps(text: /Linux/).count
=&gt; 4
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, one of the ways in which I check that my criteria are
working is by using the &ldquo;count&rdquo; method. If I'm working with a single
Watir element, I also can use the &ldquo;flash&rdquo; method to 
highlight the element briefly on the screen, in the browser. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.h2(text: 'Help Us Feed You Pi!').flash
</pre>
</p><p>
Although this makes the element extremely obvious in the browser for a
few seconds, you do need to be looking at the browser, and have it
scrolled to the appropriate element, to see it. You also can loop
through a number of matches and flash each of them in turn:


<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.ps(text: /Linux/).each {|p| p.flash}
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xec2580.0xfb2ea0"></a>
Interaction</h2></div></div><p>
Of course, Watir can do much more than retrieve information from the
browser. For example, let's assume that I want to execute a search on
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> site. Looking at the home page, I see a text field and a
search button next to it. If I enter text in that text field and
click on the search button, I should see some results.
</p><p>
By using the &ldquo;view source&rdquo; feature in my browser, I see that the
search field has a class of &ldquo;gsc-input&rdquo;. So, I focus on that
element, which removes the grayed-out &ldquo;hint&rdquo; text:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.input(class:'gsc-input').focus
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, I type into the element:


<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.input(class:'gsc-input').send_keys('Reuven')
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, I submit the search form:


<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.input(class:'gsc-search-button').click
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, the browser submits the form, and I get a list of
ego-boosting results from the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> site.
</p><p>
Notice that I used the &ldquo;send_keys&rdquo; method when typing into the form
element. There are other ways to modify the text. For example, I can
retrieve the text of the text field with the &ldquo;text&rdquo; method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.input(class:'gsc-input').text
</pre>
</p><p>
If I use the &ldquo;text_field&rdquo; method, I also can set the value of the
text in the search field before clicking on it:


<pre     class="programlisting">
pry(main)&gt; browser.text_field(class:'gsc-input').set 'Reuven'
pry(main)&gt; browser.input(value:'Search').click
</pre>
</p><p>
One of the best things about Watir is that you're not working inside
an emulation package, but rather an actual browser. This means that
you can use and test things that require JavaScript. For example, if I
go to the AirBNB.com home page, I see a huge photo behind the simple
&ldquo;Where do you want to go?&rdquo; form. That photo changes every 30 seconds
or so, but I can force it to move forward or backward by clicking on
the &lt; and &gt; signs. Is there a way for me to move the image forward or
backward without clicking on these buttons with the mouse?
</p><p>
The answer is yes, but first I have to find the elements that will
take the click. Opening the HTML source, I found that the &lt; and &gt;
buttons were defined as &lt;i&gt; elements inside a div whose class was
&ldquo;arrows&rdquo;. I was able to grab that div with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
browser.div(class: 'arrows')
</pre>
</p><p>
I then wanted to get at the &lt;i&gt; elements inside of the div. Using the
&ldquo;elements&rdquo; method on the div, I grabbed the left-arrow:

<pre     class="programlisting">
browser.div(class: 'arrows').elements.first
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, I double-checked that I had grabbed the correct element
with the &ldquo;flash&rdquo; method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
browser.div(class: 'arrows').elements.first.flash
</pre>
</p><p>
Once establishing that it was the right item, I clicked on it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
browser.div(class: 'arrows').elements.first.click
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, that did it&mdash;the front page of AirBNB.com switched
images right away, rather than waiting for the timeout to occur. In
this way, you can test JavaScript and Ajax events, as they take place
in an actual browser.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xec2580.0xfb3c60"></a>
Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
The good news is that Watir is a great tool for testing Web
applications. I've been using it only a short while, and I'm already
delighted with the sorts of sophisticated tests I can run. The
fact that I can test different browsers automatically, work against
actual sites and know that I'm using a real-world environment, rather
than one designed for testing, is a big help. Watir has come a long
way from its Windows-and-IE-only roots, and the developers deserve a
great deal of credit.
</p><p>
That said, there are a number of issues with Watir, ranging from the
difficult-to-follow installation instructions, to the confusingly
large number of related (and unrelated) Ruby gems, to the API, which
is well written, but poorly documented. It's frustrating, for
example, that I can retrieve the contents of a text area using either
the &ldquo;input&rdquo; or &ldquo;text_field&rdquo; methods, but that only text_field allows
me to change the current text value.
</p><p>
Integrating Watir into existing test facilities, such as RSpec and
Cucumber, appears to be possible, but the documentation for doing so
(like much in the Watir world) is incomplete, somewhat out of date
and spread across a number of sites.
</p><p>
Should you use Watir? Based on what I've seen, the answer is yes,
although you should be prepared to spend some time reading blog posts,
downloading a number of versions of Watir and trying to understand
why things that should work don't. Once you're past the initial
installation and learning curve, working with Watir is pleasant and
straightforward, with an API that is second to none. I've started to
incorporate Watir into my own test procedures, and I encourage you to
consider doing the same on your own projects.

For the latest versions of Watir and documentation, go to
<a href="http://watir.com" target="_self">watir.com</a>. 
</p><p>
There is now a Watir book that I
downloaded and read called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Homebrewer's Guide to Watir</em></span>
by Zeljko Filipin, an active Watir community member.
I'm sorry to say that the
book isn't well written and doesn't include very many examples or
considerations beyond simple documentation of what Watir can do. To his
credit, the author is contributing all proceeds from the book to the Watir
project.
</p><p>
A second book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cucumber and Cheese</em></span>, by Jeff Morgan, is
also available for $14.99, but I didn't have a chance to read or review it.
Links to both books are at <a href="http://watir.com/book" target="_self">watir.com/book</a>.
</p><p>
There is a Watir podcast in which prominent Watir users are interviewed
about their test techniques, available from <a href="http://watirpodcast.com" target="_self">watirpodcast.com</a> and
distributed via a variety of networks, including iTunes. It is hosted by
author and community member Zeljko Filipin.
</p><p>
A variety of Watir-related projects, such as watir-grid, are available
for download as Ruby gems. You can find a large number of Watir-related
Ruby gems by searching for &ldquo;watir&rdquo; at <a href="http://rubygems.org" target="_self">rubygems.org</a>. Other gems and resources are available from
<a href="http://watir.com" target="_self">watir.com</a>, which has a large number of pointers to
other sites and software. 
</p><p>
You can download Chromedriver from Google Code at
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver" target="_self">code.google.com/p/chromedriver</a>. From the downloads tab,
choose the driver for either Linux32 or Linux64, according to your
computer's needs. After downloading Chromedriver, install it in a
directory on your PATH, such as /usr/local/bin, or in your own personal
~/bin directory.
