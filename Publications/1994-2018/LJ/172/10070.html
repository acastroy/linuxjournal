If a server goes down, do you want to hear it?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2665580.0x275d2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, does it
make a sound? This the classic query designed to place your mind into
the Zen-like state known as the silent mind. Whether or not you want
to hear a tree fall, if you run a network, you probably want to hear a
server when it goes down. Many organizations utilize the long-established
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) as a way to monitor
their networks proactively and listen for things going down.
</p><p>
At a rudimentary level, SNMP requires only two items to work: a management
server and a managed device (or devices). The management server pulls
status and health information at regular intervals from the managed
devices and stores the information in a table. Managed devices use local
SNMP agents to notify the management server when defined behavior occurs
(such as errors or &ldquo;traps&rdquo;), which are stored in the same table on the
server. The result is an accurate, real-time reporting mechanism for
outages. However, SNMP as a protocol does not stipulate how the data in
these tables is to be presented and managed for the end user. That's
where a promising new open-source network-monitoring software called
Zenoss (pronounced Zeen-ohss) comes in.
</p><p>
Available for most Linux distributions, Zenoss builds on the basic
operation of SNMP and uses a comprehensive interface to manage even the
largest and most diverse environment. The Core version of Zenoss used
in this article is freely available under the GPLv2. An
Enterprise version also is available with additional features and support. In
this article, we install Zenoss on a CentOS 5.1 system to observe
its usefulness in a network-monitoring role. From there, we create
a simulated multisystem server network using the following systems:
a Fedora-based Postfix e-mail server, an Ubuntu server running Apache and
a Windows server running File and Print services. To conserve space, only
the CentOS installation is discussed in detail here. For the managed
systems, only SNMP installation and configuration are covered.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2665580.0x275d5c0"></a>
Building the Zenoss Server</h2></div></div><p>
Begin by selecting your hardware. Zenoss lacks specific hardware
requirements, but it relies heavily MySQL, so you can use MySQL
requirements as a rough guideline. I recommend using the fastest processor
available, 1GB of memory, fast enough hard disks to provide
acceptable MySQL performance and Gigabit Ethernet for the network. I ran
several test configurations, and this configuration seemed adequate enough
for a medium-size network (100+ nodes/devices). To keep configuration
simple, all firewalls and SELinux instances were disabled in the test
environment. If you use firewalls in your environment, open ports 161
(SNMP), 8080 (Zenoss Management Page) and 514 (if you integrate syslog
with Zenoss).
</p><p>
Install CentOS 5.1 on the server using your own preferences. I used
a bare install with no X Window System or desktop manager. Assign a static IP
address and any other pertinent network information (DNS servers and so
forth). After
the OS install is complete, install the following packages using the
yum command below:


<pre     class="programlisting">
yum install mysql mysql-server net-snmp net-snmp-utils gmp httpd
</pre>
</p><p>
If the mysqld or the httpd service has not started after yum installs it,
start it and set it to run for your configured runlevel. Next, download the
latest Zenoss Core .rpm from Sourceforge.net (2.1.3 at the time of this writing),
and install it using rpm from the command line. To start all the
Zenoss-related d&aelig;mons after the .rpm has been installed, type the following at
a command prompt:

<pre     class="programlisting">
service zenoss start
</pre>
</p><p>
Launch a Web browser from any machine, and type the IP address of the
Zenoss server using port 8080 (for example, http://192.168.142.6:8080). Log
in to the site using the default account admin with a password of
zenoss. This brings up the main dashboard. The dashboard is a
compartmentalized view of the state of your managed devices. If you
don't like the default display, you can arrange your dashboard any way
you want using the various drop-down lists on the portlets (windows). I
recommend setting the Production States portlet to display Production,
so we can see our test systems after they are added.
</p><p>
Almost everything related to managed devices in Zenoss revolves around
classes. With classes, you can create an infinite number of systems,
processes or service classifications to monitor. To begin adding
devices, we need to set our SNMP community strings at the top-level
/Devices class. SNMP community strings are like passphrases used to
authenticate traffic between devices. If one device wants to communicate
with another, they must have matching community names/strings. In many
deployments, administrators use the default community name of public
(and/or private), which creates a security risk. I
recommend changing these strings and making them into a short phrase. You
can add numbers and characters to make the community name more complex
to guess/crack, but I find phrases easier to remember.
</p><p>
Click on the Devices link on the navigation menu on the left, so
that /Devices is listed near the top of the page. Click on the
zProperties tab and scroll down. Enter an SNMP community string
in the zSNMPCommunitiy field. For our test environment, I used the
string whatsourclearanceclarence. You can use different strings with
different subclasses of systems or individual systems, but by setting
it at the /Devices class, it will be used for any subclasses unless it is
overridden. You also could list multiple strings in the zSNMPCommunities
under the /Devices class, which allows you to define multiple strings for
the discovery process discussed later. Make sure your community string
(zSNMPCommunity) is in this list.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2665580.0x275d9e0"></a>
Installing Net-SNMP on Linux Clients</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's set up our Linux systems so they can talk to the Zenoss
server. After installing and configuring the operating systems on our
other Linux servers, install the Net-SNMP package on each using the
following command on the Ubuntu server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install snmpd
</pre>
</p><p>
And, on the Fedora server use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
yum install net-snmp 
</pre>
</p><p>
Once the Net-SNMP packages are installed, edit out any other lines in
the Access Control sections at the beginning of the /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf,
and add the following lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
##      sec.name  source      community
com2sec local     localhost   whatsourclearanceclarence
com2sec mynetwork 192.168.142.0/24   whatsourclearanceclarence

##  group.name  sec.model  sec.name
group MyROGroup	v1         local
group MyROGroup	v1         mynetwork
group MyROGroup	v2c        local
group MyROGroup	v2c        mynetwork

##         incl/excl subtree  mask
view all   included  .1        80

##             context sec.model sec.level prefix  read   write  notif
access MyROGroup ""      any       noauth  exact    all    none   none
</pre>
</p><p>
Do not edit out any lines beneath the last Access Control Sections. Please
note that the above is only a mildly restrictive configuration. Consult the
snmpd.conf file or the Net-SNMP documentation if you want to tighten
access. On the Ubuntu server, you also may have to change the following
line in the /etc/snmp/default file to allow SNMP to bind to anything
other than the local loopback address:


<pre     class="programlisting">
SNMPDOPTS='-Lsd -Lf /dev/null -u snmp -I -smux -p /var/run/snmpd.pid'
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2665580.0x275de00"></a>
Installing SNMP on Windows</h2></div></div><p>
On the Windows server, access the Add/Remove Programs utility from the
Control Panel. Click on the Add/Remove Windows Components button on
the left. Scroll down the list of Components, check off Management
and Monitoring Tools, and click on the Details button. Check Simple
Network Management Protocol in the list, and click OK to install. Close
the Add/Remove window, and go into the Services console from
Administrative Tools in the Control Panel. Find the SNMP service in
the list, right-click on it, and click on Properties to bring up
the service properties tabs. Click on the Traps tab, and type in the
community name. In the list of Trap Destinations, add the IP address
of the Zenoss server. Now, click on the Security tab, and check off the
Send authentication trap box, enter the community name, and give it
READ-ONLY rights. Click OK, and restart the service.
</p><p>
Return to the Zenoss management Web page. Click the Devices link to go into
the subclass of /Devices/Servers/Windows, and on the zProperties tab,
enter the name of a domain admin account and password in the zWinUser
and zWinPassword fields. This account gives Zenoss access to the Windows
Management Instrumentation (WMI) on your Windows systems. Make sure to
click Save at the bottom of the page before navigating away.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2665580.0x275df60"></a>
Adding Devices into Zenoss</h2></div></div><p>
Now that our systems have SNMP, we can add them into Zenoss. Devices can
be added individually or by scanning the network. Let's do both. To
add our Ubuntu server into Zenoss, click on the Add Device link under
the Management navigation section. Enter the IP address of the server
and the community name. Under Device Class Path, set the selection to
/Server/Linux. You could add a variety of other hardware, software and
Zenoss information on this page before adding a system, but at a minimum,
an IP address name and community name is required (Figure 1). Click the
Add Device button, and the discovery process runs. When the results
are displayed, click on the link to the new device to access it.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10070f1.large.jpg"><img src="10070f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Adding a Device into Zenoss
</p></div></div><p>
To scan the network for devices, click the Networks link under Browse By
section of the navigation menu. If your network is not in the list, add it
using CIDR notation. Once added, check the box next to your network and
use the drop-down arrow to click on the Select Discover Devices option.
You will see a similar results page as the one from before. When complete,
click on the links at the bottom of the results page to access the new
devices. Any device found will be placed in the /Discovered class. Because
we should have discovered the Fedora server and the Windows server, they
should be moved to the /Devices/Servers/Linux and /Devices/Servers/Windows
classes, respectively. This can be done from each server's Status tab by
using the main drop-down list and selecting Manage&rarr;Change Class.
</p><p>
If all has gone well, so far we have a functional SNMP monitoring system
that is able to monitor heartbeat/availability (Figure 2) and performance
information (Figure 3) on our systems. You can customize other various
Status and Performance Monitors to meet your needs, but here we will
use the default localhost monitors.

Creating Users and Setting E-Mail Alerts</h2></div></div><p>
At this point, we can use the dashboard to monitor the managed devices,
but we will be notified only if we visit the site. It would be much more
helpful if we could receive alerts via e-mail. To set up e-mail alerting,
we need to create a separate user account, as alerts do not work under
the admin account. Click on the Setting link under the Management
navigation section. Using the drop-down arrow on the menu, select Add
User. Enter a user name and e-mail address when prompted. Click on the
new user in the list to edit its properties. Enter a password for the
new account, and assign a role of Manager. Click Save at the bottom of
the page. Log out of Zenoss, and log back in with the new account. Bring
the settings page back up, and enter your SMTP server information. After
setting up SMTP, we need to create an Alerting Rule for our new user.
Click on the Users tab, and click on the account just created in the
list. From the resulting page, click on the Edit tab and enter the e-mail
address to which you want alerts sent. Now, go to the Alerting Rules tab and
create a new rule using the drop-down arrow. On the edit tab of the new
Alerting Rule, change the Action to email, Enabled to True, and change
the Severity formula to &gt;= Warning (Figure 4). Click Save.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10070f4.large.jpg"><img src="10070f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Creating an Alert Rule
</p></div></div><p>
The above rule sends alerts when any Production server experiences an
event rated Warning or higher (Figure 5). Using a filter, you can create any
number of rules and have them apply only to specific devices or groups of
devices. If you want to limit your alerts by time to working hours, for
example, use the Schedule tab on the Alerting Rule to define a window. If
no schedule is specified (the default), the rule runs all the time. In our
rule, only one user will be notified. You also can create groups of users
from the Settings page, so that multiple people are alerted, or you could
use a group e-mail address in your user properties.

Services and Processes</h2></div></div><p>
We can expand our view of the test systems by adding a process and a
service for Zenoss to monitor. When we refer to a process in Zenoss,
we mean an active program, usually a d&aelig;mon, running on a managed
device. Zenoss uses regular expressions to monitor processes.
</p><p>
To monitor Postfix on the mail server, first, let's define it as a
process. Navigate to the Processes page under the Classes section of
the navigation menu. Use the drop-down arrow next to OS Processes, and
click Add Process. Enter Postfix as the process ID. When you return
to the previous page, click on the link to the new process. On the edit
tab of the process, enter <tt  >master</tt> in the Regex field. Click
Save before navigating away. Go to the zProperties tab of the process, and
make sure the zMonitor field is set to True. Click Save again. Navigate
back to the mail server from the dashboard, and on the OS tab, use the
topmost menu's drop-down arrow to select Add&rarr;Add OSProcess. After the
process has been added, we will be alerted if the Postfix process degrades
or fails. While still on the OS tab of the server, place a check mark
next to the new Postifx process, and from the OS Processes drop-down menu,
select Lock OSProcess. On the next set of options, select Lock from
deletion. This protects the process from being overwritten if Zenoss
remodels the server.
</p><p>
Services in Zenoss are defined by active network ports instead of running
d&aelig;mons. There are a plethora of services built in to the software, and
you can define your own if you want to. The built-in services are broken
down into two categories: IPServices and WinServices. IPservices use
any port from 1-65535 and include common network apps/protocols, such as SMTP
(Port 25), DNS (53) and HTTP (80). WinServices are intended for specific
use with Windows servers (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10070f6.large.jpg"><img src="10070f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Zenoss comes with a plethora of predefined Windows services to
monitor.
</p></div></div><p>
Adding a service is much simpler than adding a process, because there are so
many predefined in Zenoss. To monitor the HTTP service on our Web server,
navigate to the server from the dashboard. Use the main menu's drop-down
arrow on the server's OS tab arrow, and select Add&rarr;Add IPService. Type
<tt  >HTTP</tt> in the Service Class Field. Notice that the field begins to prefill
with matches as you type the letters. Select TCP as the protocol, and click
OK. Click Save on the resulting page. As with the OSProcess procedure,
return to the OS tab of the server and lock the new IPService. Zenoss
is now monitoring HTTP availability on the server (Figure 7).

Only the Beginning</h2></div></div><p>
There are a multitude of other features in Zenoss that space here
prevents covering, including Network Maps (Figure 8), a Google Maps API for
multilocation monitoring (Figure 9) and Zenpacks that provide additional
monitoring and performance-capturing capabilities for common applications.

Maps API.
</p></div></div><p>
In the span of this article, we have deployed an enterprise-grade
monitoring solution with relative ease. Although it's surprisingly easy to
deploy, Zenoss also possesses a deep feature set. It easily rivals, if not
surpasses, commercial competitors in the same product space. It is easy
to manage, highly customizable and supported by a vibrant community.
</p><p>
Although you may not achieve the silent mind as long as you work with networks,
with Zenoss, at least you will be able to sleep at night knowing you will
hear things when they go down. Hopefully, they won't be trees.
