Use the shell to manipulate a list of movies from the
Internet Movie Database (IMDb).
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1575580.0x166d4b8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we had a lot of fun digging around within the Internet Movie
Database, producing a set of scripts that together make it easy 
to generate a list of the top 250 movies on the site with release dates.
The format of the output is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
All About Eve | 1950

Hotel Rwanda | 2004

Sin City | 2005

City Lights | 1931
</pre>
</p><p>
This month, I take a look at how you can break those two fields
up and randomly generate some likely release dates close to the actual
date, then send it as a question on Twitter. For example, it might ask,
&ldquo;Hotel Rwanda was released in: 2000, 2001, 2004 or 2007?&rdquo;
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1575580.0x166d778"></a>
Splitting Up the Fields</h2></div></div><p>
Okay, this should be super easy for anyone reading this column. There
are a bunch of ways to take a two-field data record and split it up, but
my favorite tool for this sort of task is cut. So, we can do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
moviename="$(echo $entry | cut -d\| -f1)"
releasedate=$(echo $entry | cut -d\| -f2)"
</pre>
</p><p>
That was easy, right? Now, of course, if you want to be fancy about it,
you'll want to strip any leading or trailing spaces too, which can be
done with this sed command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sed 's/^ //g;s/ $//g'
</pre>
</p><p>
But, how do you get a random line out of a text file?
</p><p>
If you recall from previous columns, one of the secret features of the
Bash shell's built-in mathematical capabilities&mdash;accessible with $((
)) notation&mdash;is the ability to get a random integer without any further
fuss, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo $(( $RANDOM ))
</pre>
</p><p>
Try it in your own command shell a few times, and you'll get a series of
random integer values, like 29408 and 17501. To constrain it to the size
of the file, we could do something fancy with <tt  >wc -l</tt> to identify
the number of lines in the actual data file, but because we already know
we're grabbing 250 film titles from IMDb, it's easy just
to use that value. Here's the first stab:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pickline="$(( $RANDOM % 250 )) "
</pre>
</p><p>
It's not quite right though, because we'll get values 0&ndash;254. You can verify
this by entering the command <tt  >echo $(( 5 % 5 ))</tt>, for
example. So, we
need to shift things up one:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pickline="$(expr $(( $RANDOM % 250 )) + 1 )"
</pre>
</p><p>
That produces a random number. To extract that value from a file of
lines, there are a number of solutions, but I'll stick with sed.
In that case, the solution for pulling out line 33, as an example, is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sed -n 33p
</pre>
</p><p>
If you change the value to a variable name, however, there's a problem:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sed -n $picklinep
</pre>
</p><p>
You can't put a space between the variable name and the p, but if you
don't, you have a bad variable name, because it's pickline, not
picklinep. The solution is a secret notational convention you can use
in scripts when there's any sort of ambiguity like this&mdash;curly
brackets. So, the line ends up as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sed -n ${pickline}p
</pre>
</p><p>
That does the trick, and in an application like this, sed is lightning
fast too.
</p><p>
At this point, we have a data file of interesting information, we can
extract a random line from the file, and we can split the resultant data
into the film title and release year. How about coming up with plausible
alternative release years?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1575580.0x166e010"></a>
Calculating Random Years</h2></div></div><p>
My first inclination with generating random years was to add and subtract
1&ndash;3
years and then use those as the alternate values. If we were looking at,
say, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Shaun of the Dead</em></span>, released in 2004, we might end up with 2001
and 2007 as the options. Match a film that's more recent though,
such as 2007's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Grindhouse</em></span> (though why that's on the IMDb top 250 films
list is beyond me), and we have a problem. Suggesting 2009 as a possible
release date would be daft.
</p><p>
More important, it wouldn't take long for people to realize that it's
the middle value that's always correct on the quiz&mdash;not good. Just
like with the SAT and GMAT, it's important to avoid any possible patterns
in answers.
</p><p>
As a result, we can try something a bit more complicated. Each possible
year is the actual year of release plus or minus a random value of
1&ndash;5&mdash;close enough that it'll be challenging to remember the right year.
</p><p>
Here's the beginning of the script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
add="$(( $RANDOM % 2 ))"              
delta="$(expr $(( $RANDOM % 5 )) + 1)"      
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, add will be 0 (false) or 1 (true) for later conditional testing,
and delta is a value between one and five, just as we need. They can be
applied as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $add -eq 1 ] ; then
  newvalue=$(expr $1 + $delta )
else
  newvalue=$(expr $1 - $delta )
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
This script can be tested easily by dropping it into a simple script,
which I'll call random-years.sh. The result of applying this to the
starting year 2000 is 2002, 1998, 2005, 2001, 2003, 2004. Seems
sufficiently random, yes?
</p><p>
Now, let's consider some nuances. First, we need to ensure
that it's never past the current year, which can be done by grabbing
that value from the date command with a format string: <tt  >date
+%Y</tt>
(learn more about the many, many format strings that the date
command understands with <tt  >man strftime</tt>).
</p><p>
Second, here's a more interesting thought. If the movie came out a
long time ago, we should have a bigger delta than if it's a recent
release. In other words, if the movie is <span   class="emphasis"><em>Casablanca</em></span>, it came out in 1942,
66 years ago. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Iron Man</em></span>, which is also on the top 250 list, came out in
2008, 0 years ago. For <span   class="emphasis"><em>Casablanca</em></span>, we could have possible values of 1938
and even 1951, and it'd be a good quiz question for anyone who isn't a complete film
nut. But, that far of a spread for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Iron Man</em></span> makes no
sense. No one's going
to think it might have come out in 1999.
</p><p>
What I'm thinking about in this situation then is that the delta might be a
percentage of the age of the movie, normalized so that we always have some sort
of spread. Maybe 20%? That'd give us a delta of 13.2 for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Casablanca</em></span>
and 0 for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Iron Man</em></span>. That could work.
</p><p>
Ah, but I've run out of space. Next month, we'll go back to the random
adjacent year function to wrap it up, and then look at how to get these
questions out on Twitter rather than just on the Linux command line.
Until then, &ldquo;here's lookin' at you, kid.&rdquo;
