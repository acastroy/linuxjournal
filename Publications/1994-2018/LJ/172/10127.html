Why chase the iPhone, when we can free the world with open mobile things?

I've been writing, one way or another, for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> since 1996.
Through that whole time, we've focused more aspirational attention on one
receding goal than on any other: the desktop. Our progress has been
asymptotic, on a curve that approaches but never arrives. And it won't, as
long as we're chasing Apple and Microsoft, rather than blazing trails where
both those companies can only follow.
</p><p>
One trail is the MID: the Mobile Internet Device. In last month's UpFront
section, we reported
that some of these seemed to be on track for public unveiling at the Summer
Olympics in Beijing, which run from August 8&ndash;24. Because this is our August
issue, it's possibly happening as you read this. LinuxWorld Expo is also
happening this month, in San Francisco, California, from August 4&ndash;7.
</p><p>
But the more interesting trail, the one where we can score the biggest win
of all, is in the mobile phone frontier. At the far edge of that is a point
where the distinction between the MID and the phone verges on zero. Between
here and there are many fun possibilities, and a few scary ones.
</p><p>
The fun trail follows a vector we can project by connecting dots drawn
earlier this year. One was the purchase of Trolltech by Nokia. Another was
news that Nokia was helping port Ubuntu Linux to the ARM architecture (used
by the Nokia N810, among many other devices)&mdash;atop reports that the
Hildon Input Method (HIM) already had migrated from Nokia's Maemo to Ubuntu
Mobile. Another one&mdash;and perhaps the biggest&mdash;was news that a new
broadband venture was planned by Sprint, Clearwire, Comcast, Google, Time
Warner and Intel.
</p><p>
It's easy to project a lot of baggage onto that last one, and to get lost
in a fog of vendor sports color commentary, but the Linux angle is
relatively straightforward. Google's Android&mdash;a Linux-based software
platform for open mobile devices (primarily mobile phones)&mdash;gets a shot
at success via a coalition of partners that can produce or support many
different kinds of devices and new wireless ways to connect them to the
Net.
</p><p>
Another potential green field will be opened by 802.11y. Think of it as
high-power Wi-Fi, governed by a &ldquo;lite&rdquo; licensing regime approved by the FCC
about a year ago. With this regime, licensees pay a small fee for a
non-exclusive nationwide license. They, then pay a smaller additional fee
for every high-powered base station they deploy. Nobody on the receiving
end requires a license. Nor do the operators. Licensing allows stations to
be identifiable, which allows multiple operators politely to avoid
interference. The specification covers signaling protocols both to discover
and prevent interference. Proponents, including Peter Ecclesine of Cisco
(from whom I learned what I just wrote), believe 802.11y holds much promise
for a world where individuals and communities can connect just about any
way they like, free from rule by giant carriers.
</p><p>
Throw OLPC Wi-Fi-based mesh networking in there too. It has lots of
possibilities outside its original mission as well.
</p><p>
Nobody knows yet where any of this will go. But the contest, as usual, will
be between freedom and control, open and closed, proprietary and public
domain. The difference this time will be the playing field, which will be
inside companies as well as out in the marketplace. On one side will be
those that advocate locked-down appliances with a reduced subset of
features that advantage only the company selling the devices and its
partners in the equipment, network or content production and distribution
businesses. On the other side will be those who understand that markets
grow fastest on generative foundations&mdash;ones that support, with
little or no bias, a maximum variety of uses.
</p><p>
The best example of a locked-down mobile appliance is the iPhone. Although
it's
beautiful, useful and ground-breaking, the iPhone also will remain closed
to all but the applications Apple approves, many of those for Apple's own
purposes. Apple will continue to pioneer here, but with a closed and
controlling bias.
</p><p>
We have no equivalent best examples of generative mobile devices. Nokia's N
series (770 800, 810...) is an early prototype, and there still is no
widespread cellular (or cell-like) system that provides uncrippled Net
connectivity alongside VoIP service.
</p><p>
But, generative mobile is the goal. To mix metaphors a bit, think of the
means as a recipe. The ingredients are there. The table is set. What we
need now are some chefs to mix the ingredients together and produce some
meals that are appetizing to the marketplace.
</p><p>
As I explained in this column last month, the best examples of recent generative
inventions are the white-box PC and the Internet. The PC started changing
the world in the 1980s, and the Internet started doing the same in the 1990s.
Our hope now is that the world will be changed in the 2000s by
generative mobile devices that connect to an equally generative Internet.
</p><p>
The one sure thing is that Linux will be the base ingredient. The rest is
up to the chefs.
