No one will argue that there are different levels of
cool. But nothing, and I mean nothing, says cool like a penguin. And
some snow. And some ice. Oh, and the Antarctic. That's as cool as it
gets.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1038580.0x11303b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois! I realize it's a warm day outside,
but
it is positively freezing in here. Our guests will need coats, in August,
no less. What are all these portable air conditioners doing here? Is that
frost I see on the windows? Fran&ccedil;ois! I shudder&mdash;make that
shiver&mdash;to think what this possibly could be about. Yes, this issue's
theme is
Cool Projects, but nowhere did it say frozen. And, when our editors
said cool, I think they meant it in the sense of &ldquo;really interesting
and
exciting&rdquo;. Never mind. Our guests will be here momentarily, and I
don't
think they are dressed for this. Quickly, run to Diane's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Manteaux
de
Cuir</em></span> across the street and beg her to provide us with some coats
for
tonight. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Vite!</em></span> Our guests are arriving as we speak.
</p><p>
Welcome, everyone, to a very chilly <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>.
Please pardon the
cold. My faithful waiter has once again taken a simple idea to its
amusing, if somewhat outrageous, extreme. Nevertheless, he will return
shortly with warm coats for all. In the meantime, please take your tables
and make yourselves comfortable. Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you have returned with
Diane. Thank you, Diane, for your help. While everyone slips into their
coats, perhaps Fran&ccedil;ois can fetch the wine. There's a case of 2004
Bodegas Muga Reserva from Spain in the lower level of the cellar's
east wing.
</p><p>
As Fran&ccedil;ois already has set the stage for us, we're going to explore
some Linux coolness. The symbol of Linux coolness is, of course, the
penguin. Tux, the Linux mascot (designed by Larry Ewing), is a penguin, and
penguins show up pretty much everywhere you turn in the Linux world. In
fact, you can't go near a Linux system, magazine, T-shirt, mouse pad,
coffee mug or book, without running into some kind of penguin. That's
okay for most people, because, well, penguins are cute.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1038580.0x11307d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Penguins and Linus Torvalds</b></p><p>
Responsible for this whole penguin mania is Linus
Torvalds, the Linux kernel's creator. When asked what he envisioned
for a mascot, Linus replied, &ldquo;You should be imagining a slightly
overweight penguin, sitting down after having gorged itself, and
having just burped. It's sitting there with a beatific smile&mdash;the
world is a good place to be when you have just eaten a few gallons of
raw fish and you can feel another burp coming.&rdquo;
</p></div><p>
Ah, Fran&ccedil;ois, you have returned. Please, pour for our guests. Enjoy the
wine, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>. This Spanish beauty is very rich, very
complex,
yet fresh tasting and well balanced. Hmm...make sure you fill my
glass as well, Fran&ccedil;ois.
</p><p>
The first item on tonight's menu is Matthew Miller's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>IceBreaker</em></span>
(Figure 1). The premise is similar to events you see every day in
the news. A bunch of penguins need to be captured and
sent off to Finland. They are all on an iceberg in Antarctica, in an area
where global warming hasn't yet started breaking the ice. Penguins,
as it turns out, need to travel with ice or they just won't behave. The
question becomes, &ldquo;How much ice?&rdquo;
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10132f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. In
<span  class="emphasis"><em>IceBreaker</em></span>, you must send your penguins packing to
Finland with as little
ice as possible.
</p></div></div><p>
As you can imagine, shipping penguins to Finland is expensive, so the
order of the day is small ice chunks. When you left-click on the iceberg,
a line is drawn across it, separating the two areas of ice. If a penguin
hits the line as it is being drawn, your cut effectively is halted. A
right-click changes the direction of the cut from horizontal to vertical
(or vice versa). To clear an iceberg and move on, you need to clear at
least 80% of the ice. Should you manage the job, another penguin is
added and you get to start over on the next level.
</p><p>
The more penguins you add, the more complicated it becomes, as they bounce
frantically across the ice field. On the off chance that you find this all
too simple, there's a menu of options where you can change the difficulty
level. Click MENU on the lower right of the screen, and a pop-up
menu appears (Figure 2). Not only can you change the difficulty here,
but you also can turn sound effects on or off, check high scores and
run the game in full-screen mode.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="10132f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. If the game seems too
easy, you can increase the difficulty.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1038580.0x11310c0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>KBounce</em></span></b></p><p>
A similar game called <span   class="emphasis"><em>KBounce</em></span> exists as part
of the KDE games package, minus the cute penguins bouncing around.
</p></div><p>
Willi Kappler's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snowball</em></span> (Figure 3) is a classic
jump-and-run
multiplatform game. It's also an interesting puzzler that requires a lot
of thought before you can advance to the next level (of which there are
20). Your job is to find some way to help your penguin (Tux, in one
of his many incarnations) release a trapped snowball and roll it into
the exit. Along the way, you place (and remove) a limited number of ice
blocks, collect gold coins and other treasure, all the while avoiding
various dangers, including monsters. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snowball</em></span> is
written in Python, and
it's available from <a href="http://www.snowball.retrovertigo.de" target="_self">www.snowball.retrovertigo.de</a>.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10132f3.large.jpg"><img src="10132f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Snowball</em></span> is
a combination jump-and-run and puzzle-solving game.
</p></div></div><p>
On the right-hand side, a sidebar shows the
number of available ice blocks as well as your current score and
remaining lives. Using the Action key, you can either place or remove
ice blocks. You use these blocks to climb to higher levels and to block the
path of monsters. Find a way to release the snowball and guide it to the
open doorway. The so-called Action key is, by default, the Enter
key&mdash;something I found hard to manipulate when I was using cursor keys
with
the same hand. I switched the Action key
to the spacebar instead via the Options menu (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10132f4.large.jpg"><img src="10132f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Snowball</em></span>'s Options menu
is the place to go for keyboard mapping.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Snowball</em></span> hasn't been updated in a while, but it's
still a lot of fun
in its current form and sure to provide a few hours of frozen fun. It
would be great if Willi could be convinced to revisit his game or invite
another developer to take over. If you want to try modifying
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Snowball</em></span>
on your own, there's an included level editor.
</p><p>
By now, you may have noticed that cold, snow, ice, penguins and Linux
strangely seem to go together very nicely. Another great penguin-themed
game, and one you must have a look at, is Ingo Ruhnke's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pingus</em></span> (Figure 5). This is a game based on the classic
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Lemmings</em></span> game (circa 1991),
where you assist some friendly little creatures in escaping various
dangers. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pingus</em></span>, however, is much more than a clone.
It has become a
classic in its own right. Sit back, sip your wine, and relax while I
tell you the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pingus</em></span> story.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10132f5.large.jpg"><img src="10132f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. <span  class="emphasis"><em>Pingus</em></span> is the coolest
<span  class="emphasis"><em>Lemmings</em></span> clone, ever!
</p></div></div><p>
The Pingus, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, have been living happily at the
South Pole,
presumably gorging themselves on fish. In time, their environment started
to, er, go south, with the temperatures rising, the ice melting and the
food supply getting tight. Rather than look for colder climes, as did other
animals, the heroic Pingus decided to embark upon a quest to discover the
source of this environmental havoc. You, as the leader of the Pingus, will
find yourself commanding hordes of Pingus who must be directed to safety
or certain death. To do this, you instruct the Pingus to perform various tasks,
which vary depending on the level you are currently playing. You need
to think fast and act even more quickly to win each level.
</p><p>
If you feel up to the challenge of saving the Pingus, it's time to
get your copy. The latest version of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pingus</em></span> always is
available from
the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pingus</em></span> Web site at <a href="http://pingus.seul.org" target="_self">pingus.seul.org</a>. Packaged versions of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pingus</em></span> are included with a number of different
distributions, so check
your distribution CDs or your usual software repositories. If you can't
find it there, you always can pick up the latest package from the Web site.
</p><p>
When you launch <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pingus</em></span>, the main menu offers up four
choices. One
of these is labeled Story, and this is where you should begin (I
will discuss the other choices shortly). Once you decide to embark on
the journey, you will arrive at Mogorok Island, also known as Tutorial
Island, to begin your training (Figure 6).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10132f6.large.jpg"><img src="10132f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. The
journey you face is difficult, and as such, you first must undergo
rigorous training.
</p></div></div><p>
On subsequent starts, you will return to Tutorial Island, but you won't
jump into the story immediately. The story of the Pingus (of which I've
given you a short version) and why these poor penguins are on their
perilous quest, is shown automatically only when you first play. If you
want to reacquaint yourself with the tale, click the Show story
check box at the top left.
</p><p>
At each level, there is an instruction screen providing some explanation
of what you are facing and how you might deal with the challenges ahead
(Figure 7). This can include digging through the ground or through walls,
outfitting your penguins with backpacks to help them fly, turning some
into blockers (so the others don't fall to their doom) and more. In
some cases, you are forced to transform some of your penguins into
bombers. Yes, that's exactly what it sounds like. Sometimes the only
way to save the others is to sacrifice a few by making them blow up and,
hopefully, blowing holes through whatever stands in the way of the others'
safety.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10132f7.large.jpg"><img src="10132f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. With
each new challenge, <span  class="emphasis"><em>Pingus</em></span> offers tips to help you on
your quest.
</p></div></div><p>
The Tutorial Island I mentioned is a complete game in itself with
nearly two-dozen levels. Once you leave Tutorial island, 
more Pingus action waits for you. Some of that action is easy
to find, and some requires a little spelunking. From the intro screen,
you can enter Tutorial Island by clicking the Story button. Click
Levelsets, however, and a spooky Halloween adventure awaits. So far,
neither of these options qualifies as hidden, and this is where
the spelunking comes into play.
</p><p>
Each of these games, whether it is Tutorial Island or the Halloween
adventure, is considered a level (or rather, a collection of
levels). The path to the various levels is usually found in
/usr/share/games/pingus/data/levels (if you installed from
source, the top-level directory won't be /usr, of course).
Under that levels directory, you'll find the tutorial directory where the
Tutorial Island levels are located. A couple additional
interesting directories are there, including one for your Halloween
adventures. Perhaps the most interesting ones are the wip (work in progress)
directory and the playable directory. Do an
<tt  >ls</tt> in either of those directories, and you'll find a couple
hundred other levels&mdash;not all of them playable, granted,
but still fun to try. To run one of those levels, simply pass the full
pathname to the pingus executable, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pingus /usr/share/games/pingus/data/levels/
&#8618;wip/hellmouth11-grumbel.pingus
</pre>
</p><p>
Doing the above lets you play the game in the work in progress
directory called hellmouth11 (Figure
8). Finally, should you feel so inclined, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pingus</em></span> has a
built-in level editor (that's the other menu option at the start), so you can create your
own levels and contribute to the game's development.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10132f8.large.jpg"><img src="10132f8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Hundreds
of additional levels, including the Hellmouth, await you, if you dare
to explore.
</p></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Pingus</em></span> is a great game, and it's great fun. The hidden levels offer a
treasure trove of weird and wonderful side quests. Take my word for it,
you need to check this one out. Besides, the future of the Pingus
depends on you!
</p><p>
Ah, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, I can see by the clock on the wall that we are nearly
out of time, and there are still many penguins to save. Perhaps a few
more minutes will bring us that much closer to getting our chilly friends
to their goal. In the meantime, I'm sure we can convince Fran&ccedil;ois to
refill your glasses one more time while you huddle in your coats. I promise that the next time you arrive, I will make
sure that the temperature approaches something more temperate.
Raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one another's
health.
