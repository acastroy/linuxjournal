How to get X running on a Gumstix embedded device with an E-Ink display and
run all your favorite X11 applications.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20be580.0x21b62a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I'm excited by E-paper and the promise it holds. You've probably already
heard about E-Ink's E-Paper Display (EPD) and seen it in recent E-book
reader products. The E-Ink display media needs no power to hold an image, and
it reflects light just like real paper. I've even seen recent products that
make use of the physical flexibility of the E-Ink film in order to create
&ldquo;rollable&rdquo; displays. But yes, this technology still has a few constraints. Current EPD displays are grayscale only and have measurable
display latencies. However, I'm convinced that these limitations will
disappear over time, as has happened with many other disruptive technologies.

</p></div></div><p>
E-paper devices have been on the market since around 2006 or so. The good
news is that Linux has become the de facto standard operating system for
almost all of these devices. The two major products, Amazon Kindle and
Sony PRS series, both utilize embedded Linux to achieve their
functionality. Those products are great, but it also is fun to build your own
device and use your own applications. That is where the Gumstix embedded
device comes into play. E-Ink has a kit called the AM200
E-Paper Development Kit that provides all the hardware accessories 
you need to build your own E-paper device. Best of all, the kit is
designed to work with Linux and is quite hack-friendly.
</p><p>
The AM200 kit serves to provide proof of concept for E-Ink. The software
it provides helps you run a user-space application that
lets you decode portable pixel map (PPM) images to the display. This is just
to demonstrate the basic capabilities of the kit. It does not let you run
normal X11 applications, such as xterm or xeyes. That's where this article comes
in&mdash;it should help you add a set of building blocks that expand the
system's functionality. These building blocks will enable the system to support a
standard X server. Once you've gotten an X server on the system, 
you pretty much can run anything that's available from the realm of the penguin and
the wildebeest, including your favorite Web browsers and PDF
readers.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10110f2.large.jpg"><img src="10110f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Running Dillo, xeyes, XClock and XLogo on an E-Ink Display 
</p></div></div><p>
First, let's do a quick review of the hardware infrastructure we're
using to better understand the software we need to add. The
display shown in Figure 3 is an E-Ink Vizplex display that has a
Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) back end. This is connected through the fine pitch
(FPC) ribbon cable to the adapter board. This adapter board is there to
distribute the correct signals to the display connectors and also to provide
some expansion buttons that can be accessed using General-Purpose Input Output
(GPIO) from the Gumstix. This adapter board sources its signals from the
Metronome controller board, which is the display interface. 
It carries the Metronome controller, which has an associated Linux
framebuffer driver called metronomefb to which X will be talking. The
Metronome controller board is connected via another FPC ribbon cable to
the Gumstix board. The Gumstix board has the XScale PXA255
CPU and all the associated interfaces, such as Bluetooth, SD card, USB and
others. The Lyre mainboard is the carrier for the Gumstix board. This Lyre
mainboard has the power block, battery stuff, status LEDs, USB network
interface and USB serial interface that allows us to control the Gumstix
from a standard PC.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10110f3.large.jpg"><img src="10110f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Picture and Block Diagram of the Hardware 
</p></div></div><p>
Now, let's dig in to the software side of things. The Gumstix board has
relatively strong Linux support. That said, the development environment for
it is not yet perfect. But, these things are continuing to see rapid
change, so be
prepared to roll up your sleeves and hack a bit. 
</p><p>
When your Gumstix board arrives, it could have one of two possible firmware
configurations. The first is firmware built using a set of tools called
buildroot. Buildroot is a collection of makefiles and scripts to help you
set up a cross-compile environment for embedded systems. Buildroot will help
you pull down everything you need to build a root filesystem image for your Gumstix board automatically. It was the de facto standard for
Gumstix until about a year ago. The second possibility is 
a board with firmware built using the OpenEmbedded (OE) framework.
OpenEmbedded is a new software framework for building embedded
distributions. It is quite a bit more advanced than buildroot in terms of
capabilities. It also is the currently preferred build environment for Gumstix.
For the purpose of this project, either one should be good enough, and both are
fairly easy to use. I cover the steps for both of them in this
article.
</p><p>
The new software building block that we'll add to this system is
something called deferred IO. Deferred IO is a recently added hack in the
Linux kernel that allows nonmemory-mappable devices to pretend to be
memory-mappable. It also allows us to hide the latency associated with the E-Ink
display. This hack is what makes it possible to run X with various E-Ink
controllers on Linux. We'll also add the Metronome and AM200 drivers
that provide the Linux framebuffer interface for the Metronome controller
together with the Gumstix board.
</p><p>
Okay, now we can do some real work. The first thing to do
is establish a working environment on the Gumstix. Power on your Gumstix
board and connect the two USB ports to your host machine. This lets you
set up the USB-serial console and also creates a USB-net connection with
which to transfer
files. You can use minicom or cu to use the Gumstix serial console. If
your board is in working condition, you should see this when you connect:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Connected.

Welcome to the Gumstix Linux Distribution!

gumstix login: 
</pre>
</p><p>
The user name is root, and the password is gumstix. 
Log in to check whether your SD card works. If all is well,
you should see the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
gumstix login: root
Password: 
Welcome to Gumstix!
# mount
/dev/root on / type jffs2 (rw)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
/sys on /sys type sysfs (rw)
udev on /dev type ramfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw)
/dev/mmcblk0p1 on /mnt/mmc type vfat 
 &#8618;(rw,sync,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=cp437,iocharset=iso8859-1)
tmpfs on /tmp type tmpfs (rw)
</pre>
</p><p>
The line with a mount entry called /mnt/mmc shows there is working SD
card support. 
</p><p>
Now that we've established a working environment, we can approach
building the kernel. We want to use the 2.6.25 kernel, because it
supports all the devices we are interested in and has the features we've
talked about so far. To build this kernel, we need some things from our
development environment&mdash;that is, the cross compiler that will allow us to
compile binaries for the XScale CPU using a standard x86 host. Don't be
frightened by this. It's not that hard. As mentioned before, there are
two choices of tools to set up everything for you. The first is
buildroot. I used the following incantation to set up a buildroot
environment:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir gumstix_build
# cd gumstix_build
# svn co -r1441 http://svn.gumstix.com/gumstix-buildroot/
    &#8618;trunk gumstix-buildroot
# make defconfig
# make
</pre>
</p><p>
This pulls down revision 1441 of the buildroot build. Select the
appropriate option for your Gumstix board. Mine was a basix, so I selected
the BR2_TARGET_GUMSTIX_BASIXCONNEX and GUMSTIX_400MHZ entries. This build
revision worked fine on my Ubuntu Edgy build machine, but you may need to
experiment with the revision tag to find one that builds well on
your chosen system. This build stage takes a while, as buildroot pulls
down a wide set of sources and starts building everything from scratch. It
will take at least several hours even on high-end machines. I typically
leave this stage running overnight. Once it completes, key
utilities will be added to your path. The ones that are necessary to our operation are:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./build_arm_nofpu/staging_dir/bin/arm-linux-gcc
./build_arm_nofpu/staging_dir/bin/mkimage
./build_arm_nofpu/staging_dir/bin/arm-linux-objcopy
</pre>
</p><p>
That should settle things for buildroot users. If you are using OE, 
your incantation is slightly different:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# mkdir gumstix_build
# cd gumstix_build
# svn co https://gumstix.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/
    &#8618;gumstix/trunk gumstix-oe
# . ~/gumstix/gumstix-oe/extras/profile
# # edit your build config to select the 
# # right machine (basix, connex, or verdex)
# bitbake gumstix-basic-image
</pre>
</p><p>
Bitbake manages the dependencies and figures out what to build and
how to build the cross-compilation environment. Suffice it to say that this
stage is not the speediest to complete, so plan on taking
an extended break before your tools are ready. On my build machine, the
OE build takes about two days to complete.
Please refer to the Gumstix OE Build Details link (see Resources) in order to set up your
build config for your Gumstix board.
</p><p>
Now that you have a working environment, you need to pull down the mainline
kernel tree that has the driver for the E-Ink Metronome controller and
deferred IO support. I typically just pull down Linus Torvalds' latest tree.
Once that is done, select and build using the right config file for your
kit. On mine, the steps to do this are:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# git pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/
    &#8618;kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
# cd linux-2.6
# cp arch/arm/configs/am200epdkit_defconfig .config
# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- ARCH=arm oldconfig
# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- ARCH=arm menuconfig
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, select Device Drivers&rarr;Graphics support&rarr;Support for framebuffer
devices, and make sure to turn on the module option for AM200 E-Ink EPD
devkit support. Here's the next step, which builds some
binaries:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- ARCH=arm 
# arm-linux-objcopy -O binary -R .note -R .comment 
  &#8618;-S arch/arm/boot/compressed/vmlinux linux.bin
# mkimage -A arm -O linux -T kernel -C none -a 0xa0008000 
  &#8618;-e 0xa0008000 -n "uImage" -d linux.bin arch/arm/boot/uImage 
</pre>
</p><p>
This uImage file is what we will feed to the bootloader for our kernel. We
also need to copy the modules that are used by the framebuffer drivers that
we need to support X. We need to transfer these files to the SD card. The
simplest way is to use an SD card reader and transfer it using your
normal desktop mechanism. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# cp arch/arm/boot/uImage /media/sd/
# cp drivers/video/metronomefb.ko drivers/video/am200epd.ko 
  &#8618;drivers/video/sys*.ko drivers/video/fb_sys_fops.ko /media/sd/
</pre>
</p><p>
Once that's done, you're ready to boot your new kernel on the Gumstix. To do
this, you need to interrupt the normal boot process. On the Gumstix serial
console, type <tt  >reboot</tt>, and press any key to interrupt the normal boot process.
</p><p>
After that, you can use the following sequence of u-boot commands to let
u-boot read the SD card, then retrieve and load the kernel into memory and
finally boot from this memory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# reboot
The system is going down NOW !!
Sending SIGTERM to all processes.
Please stand by while rebooting the system.
Restarting system.

Success! We now have booted a kernel with everything we need. The next step
is adding Xfbdev. With OpenEmbedded, this step is fairly straightforward;
simply execute the following command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# bitbake xserver-kdrive
</pre>
</p><p>
This generates an appropriate package (.ipk) file in the
gumstix_build/tmp/deploy/ipk/armv5t/ directory. It should look something
like xserver-kdrive-fbdev_1.4-r1_armv5te.ipk. Copy this file to the SD card,
and use the following command to install it on your Gumstix:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# ipkg install /mnt/mmc/xserver-kdrive-fbdev_1.4-r1_armv5te.ipk
</pre>
</p><p>
If you have buildroot, the process is somewhat similar, but you need to do
some in-build munging. First, do the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd gumstix-buildroot
# make menuconfig
# # Go to Package Selection for Target-&gt; then enable 
# # the checkbox for the item labeled TinyX. 
# # This is the other name for Xfbdev.
# make
</pre>
</p><p>
This generates the Xfbdev and associated applications, such as xterm, XLogo,
xeyes and others. You can copy these to your Gumstix's root filesystem. At
this point, Xfbdev finally is on the system. We're almost at the finish
line. On your Gumstix console, load the drivers we copied earlier:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cd /mnt/mmc
# insmod drivers/video/syscopyarea.ko &amp;&amp;
  &#8618;insmod drivers/video/sysfillrect.ko &amp;&amp;
  &#8618;insmod drivers/video/sysimgblt.ko &amp;&amp;
  &#8618;insmod drivers/video/fb_sys_fops.ko
# insmod drivers/video/metronomefb.ko
# insmod drivers/video/am200epd.ko 
fb1: Metronome frame buffer device, using 505K of video memory
</pre>
</p><p>
The fb1 kernel message indicates that we now have a real framebuffer device
to play with. Now, we need to point Xfbdev at the right device, so enter this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# # make fb0 actually become fb1
# rm /dev/fb0
# mknod /dev/fb0 c 29 1
# /usr/X11R6/bin/Xfbdev -ac &amp;

</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, you should see the familiar crosshatch pattern of X. Yes, we
finally did it! We now have an X11-enabled E-Ink display. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10110f4.large.jpg"><img src="10110f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Xfbdev Running on Gumstix E-Ink 
</p></div></div><p>
What to do next?
Well, the Gumstix device has USB-net support, which means you now have a
remote X11 display that you can connect to from any other machine on the
network. You can point any X11 application at it&mdash;for example:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# # 10.0.0.2 is the E-Ink display
# # Slideshow
# for i in `ls *.jpg` ; do echo $i ;
  &#8618; xloadimage -display 10.0.0.2:0 -global -rotate 90 $i ;
  &#8618; done
# # PDF slideshow
# (( i = 1 )) ; while (( $i &lt; 21 )) ; do echo $i ;
  &#8618;xpdf -remote eink /tmp/mybook.pdf $i -display 10.0.0.2:0 ; 
  &#8618;sleep 3 ; (( i = $i + 1 )) ; done
# # Remote display an Ubuntu desktop on your E-Ink display
# DISPLAY=10.0.0.2 vncviewer ubuntu_box:1
</pre>

The Future</h2></div></div><p>
A lot of work has been going on to enrich the Gumstix
toolset and provide better integration with the AM200 kit. Projects like
OpenEmbedded are simplifying embedded Linux work. I see a bright future for these displays (no pun intended).
I don't think it will be much longer before we 
have displays that we can roll up just like paper and stuff in our back
pockets. The costs will come down, and we'll be able to scatter them on a
desk just like regular paper and treat them as extensions of our normal
desktop display. Linux will continue to be at the forefront of this with its
unique capabilities.
