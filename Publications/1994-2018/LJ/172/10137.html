Linux Game Publishing and Ascaron Entertainment's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sacred Gold</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
Our team is truly tickled at how many high-end Linux-based games are now
at our disposal. One of the latest is Ascaron Entertainment's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sacred
Gold</em></span>, which includes <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sacred</em></span> and its expansion, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sacred:
Underworld</em></span>. Linux
Game Publishing is responsible for the Linux port. The companies plug
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sacred</em></span> as an action-filled role-playing game that &ldquo;combines an exciting
story line with great gameplay&rdquo;. In addition to porting a broad range
of Linux-based games, Linux Game Publishing also supports open-source
development by making available a number of libraries it has developed
over time for its games.

Jedox AG's Palo</h2></div></div><p>
Though you likely never will experience a GPL'd Microsoft Excel, you can
use the open-source Palo 2.5 from Jedox to serve up Excel spreadsheets.
Palo is a multi-user, high-performance data server application that
allows workers enterprise-wide to access, change and collaborate on
multiple spreadsheets in real time. Improvements in the new version
2.5 include a newly optimized MOLAP (Multidimensional OnLine Analytical
Processing) engine, intelligent local data cache, faster multidimensional
data processing, an enhanced multidimensional formula editor and
advanced query capability. The workstation-resident data cache uses an
&ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; technology to reduce calls to the central server. Palo is
available in free, enterprise and government editions.

SugarCRM's Sugar Data Center Edition</h2></div></div><p>
Diversifying the open-source CRM space is SugarCRM with its new Sugar
Data Center Edition. The new product line offers a complete set of
systems management, provisioning and monitoring tools that enable service
providers and large organizations to deploy and manage multiple instances&mdash;distinct versions of
SugarCRM&mdash;from a centralized management console.
In the absence of these capabilities, says SugarCRM, large enterprises
are forced to eliminate multiple instances in a subdivision of their
organization and make serious trade-off decisions regarding functionality
and customizations/localizations for the sake of centralized and
Web-services-based applications. With the new Sugar Data Center Edition,
organizations &ldquo;can get creative and deep with customizations and locations
at no expense to one department or end user&rdquo;.

Tony Mullen's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce, Tumble, and Splash!</em></span> (Sybex)</h2></div></div><p>
To our squeals of delight, Sybex is tearing off its Clark Kent-like
demeanor to present Tony Mullen's B<span   class="emphasis"><em>ounce, Tumble, and Splash! Simulating
the Physical World with Blender 3D</em></span>. Blender is an immensely popular,
multiplatform, open-source, 3-D content-creation suite. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Bounce, Tumble,
and Splash!</em></span>, says Sybex, is the only title to offer &ldquo;step-by-step
instructions on Blender's more complex features while showcasing
the unique objects and characters that can be created in Blender&rdquo;.
Topics include soft bodies and cloth, the Blender particle system, static
particles and hair, fluids, bullet physics, the Blender Game Engine
and plant simulation. The book's tone is &ldquo;friendly but professional&rdquo;
and focuses on full-color examples with clear, in-depth explanations of
how each step was taken and why each choice was made.

Syuzi Pakhchyan's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fashioning Technology</em></span> (O'Reilly)</h2></div></div><p>
Geeks, start your...sewing machines! Such is the wish of Syuzi Pakhchyan,
author of the new O'Reilly book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fashioning Technology</em></span> that explores
the integration of traditional sewing and assembly techniques with
electronics and other new materials. The book is a guide to inventing
creative clothing, housewares and toys that are fun, interactive, quirky
and useful. Author Pakhchyan&mdash;an artist, roboticist and teacher&mdash;explains how to use smart materials such as thermo- and photochromatic
inks that change color by touch or sunlight, magnetic and conductive
paints, polymorph plastic, fiber optics and more. Each project, says
O'Reilly, encourages readers to personalize and customize their own
designs, materials and craft skills.

ParAccel's Scalable Analytic Appliance</h2></div></div><p>
The job of ParAccel's new Scalable Analytic Appliance is to provide
manageability for large- and medium-size enterprises struggling
with the challenge of analyzing operational data in near real time
or executing complex queries on multi-terabyte data warehouses.
The new enterprise-class appliance is based on ParAccel's columnar,
compressed, massively parallel relational database engine, combined
with a managed storage infrastructure and industry-standard servers.
The appliance utilizes a blended and dynamically balanced scan approach
to take maximum advantage of both server- and SAN-based storage. It also
leverages a new SAN-based approach for high availability and integrates
tightly into managed storage control systems to manage backups, disaster
recovery mechanisms, reporting and monitoring. A pilot program for the
product is currently underway.

Numerical Algorithms Group NAG Toolbox for MATLAB</h2></div></div><p>
If you use the MATLAB environment, you now can extend it heftily using
Numerical Algorithms Group's NAG Toolbox. The Toolbox gives users access
to more than 1,300 additional math and statistical algorithms for MATLAB.
This additional mathematical and statistical functionality previously
was unavailable, or it was accessible to MATLAB users only by purchasing multiple
toolboxes. The company claims that &ldquo;the NAG Library is used by many of
the world's most prominent ISVs, scientists and academies, among others,
because of its reputation for quality, flexibility and robustness&rdquo;.
The NAG Toolbox is available for both 32- and 64-bit Linux and Windows and
is compatible with MATLAB versions 2007a, 2007b and 2008a.

Canonical's Ubuntu Netbook Remix</h2></div></div><p>
At the time of this writing, details remain sketchy, but by the time you read
this, Canonical will have officially announced Ubuntu Netbook Remix, an
ultraportable version of its popular Linux distribution. In interviews
with the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Guardian</em></span> newspaper, Ubuntu founder and patron Mark Shuttleworth,
revealed close collaboration with Intel, which produces chips for this
sector. Shuttleworth sees Netbook Remix as one way that Linux will
become more prevalent, as people access their files and information from
a wider variety of devices connected to the Internet.
