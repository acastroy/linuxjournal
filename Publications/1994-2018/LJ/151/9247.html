No history book on the Internet would be complete without a chapter on
Tim Bray.  Not only was Tim a co-editor of the XML 1.0 specification,
but he also created the first parser software for XML documents and has
been co-driving the development of Atom.  Today, fulfilling a dual role
as tireless Netizen-evangelist and Director of Web Technologies for Sun
Microsystems, Tim continues to build on his early work by advocating
for a more elegant, platform-independent and user-friendly Internet.
<i  >Linux Journal</i> recently checked in with Tim Bray to get an update
on where he is channeling his creative energies these days.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: You have been Director of Web Technologies for Sun Microsystems for
just more than two years now.  Can you tell us what kinds of projects you've
been pursuing in that role?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: The most important project is helping return Sun to the position
it should be in: profitable and growing.  At Sun, I've been a
generalist, which is good for someone with adult-ADD.  I did a lot of
work on launching the employee blogging (see <a href="http://blogs.sun.com" target="_self">blogs.sun.com</a>).  I've
been an evangelist in favor of Sun embracing alternatives to Java&mdash;both running languages like PHP and Ruby on the Java platform, and
embracing those languages in their native form as perfectly viable
options for developers.  I've been a vocal skeptic of the WS-*
project, preferring simpler, more lightweight alternatives based on
proven Web technologies.  And I've been doing a ton of work on the Atom
technology, both co-chairing the IETF working group and evangelizing it
to developers.  I've also done some work on disk I/O performance (I'm
the original author of the venerable &ldquo;Bonnie&rdquo; benchmark).  Finally,
I've been whittling away at a skunkworks named Sigrid for a couple of
years now, but &lt;blush&gt; have yet to release anything.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: Does the position at Sun give you an effective &ldquo;bully
pulpit&rdquo; from
which to effect positive change on issues important to you?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: No change comes easy, and no single individual has a fulcrum placed
in such a way that he or she can move the earth.  I've put my weight behind
a few ideas and efforts that have moved forward in a way that pleased
me, and I've failed to make much progress in some other areas.  I think the
degree to which I'm listened to has more to do with what I say&mdash;whether
it makes sense and is interesting&mdash;than who I work for.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: What issues and trends are you currently most passionate about, and
what form is your advocacy taking?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: I think Atom, both the format and the protocol, are going to be
pervasive technologies that will have highly visible consequences.
Based on my XML experience, I'm now too smart to try to predict exactly
what those consequences will be.  But I'm evangelizing it everywhere I
get a chance, most recently from the stage at OSCON.  Enough others have
taken up the task of questioning WS-* that I no longer feel compelled
to speak up quite so often.  Second, I am a very small part of the
groundswell of developers heading in the direction of dynamically typed
languages.  I am personally quite passionately convinced that almost
all DRM technologies are technically broken and bad for business, but
this has little to do with my day job.
</p><p>
For all the things I care about, I find my blog
(<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing" target="_self">www.tbray.org/ongoing</a>) the most effective way to share my views
with the world; mostly because it's a conversation, not a bully pulpit.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: As you say, you have been devoting a great deal of energy to
Atom.  What is your specific role in it, and what are your thoughts on
where it is headed?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: I'm the co-chair of the IETF Working Group, and one of the loudest
Atom evangelists.  Both the Atom data format and the Atom Publishing
Protocol (APP) are going to be big.  The data format will be used in
some places where RSS is now, but it turns out that there is a demand
for a general-purpose &ldquo;collection&rdquo; format&mdash;something
XML has never had,
and Atom suits that bill.  The APP provides a low-friction, simple,
standardized way to post anything (words, pictures, movies) to the Web, to
update it, and to delete it.  There's an excellent chance that it will be
included in a high proportion of the future's cell phones, not to mention
e-mail and Web and news and office-productivity clients, which will thus
be able to post to any Web-publishing service that plays by the rules.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: You were one of the three editors of the original XML 1.0
specification.  What are your thoughts on the results eight years
later?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: I'm horribly unsatisfied and keenly aware of all the ways in which
XML could have been better, mostly by being smaller and simpler.  XML
addressed a huge, painful problem (standardized machine-independent
data format) at the right time, and it didn't suck just enough, so it
became the default solution.  That aside, I'm happy that the world has
bought into the notion of sending data around in a way that is thoroughly
internationalized and radically independent of any programming language
or operating system or hardware.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: From what I understand, XML grew out of the unwieldy SGML and a
project to put the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) on-line, is that
correct?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: Not quite.  XML grew out of SGML, which was used in a lot of
high-end publishing systems, but not the New OED project, which I managed.
The electronic OED, at the time I was there, used a markup system that was
an awful lot like what we now call XML; as a side effect of working with
it, and then of founding a company, Open Text, to take our inventions to
market, I became familiar with SGML.  In 1996, when Jon Bosak was getting
the XML Project launched, there were maybe a dozen people in the world
who were familiar with both SGML and with the Web, and I was one of them.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: How do you think things stand regarding XML as a document format,
post controversy with the State of Massachusetts regarding the Open
Document Format?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: The fight is basically over; the public sector has noticed the risk
reduction and flexibility you get from storing long-lived documents in
an XML-based format and has started a move in that direction that will
become pervasive, world-wide.  After years of trying to convince them
that proprietary formats for public data were okay, Microsoft has shifted
gears and is frantically trying to apply a thin coat of
&ldquo;standards&rdquo;
paint to its own Office XML formats; the spec is thousands of pages in
length and will never be fully implemented by anything but Microsoft
Office, which kind of misses the point.  I'm pretty confident that the
public-sector policy-makers will see through this pathetic ruse.  The
private sector, which typically has a shorter temporal horizon, is less
far along the road to taking good care of its information resources,
but it'll get there too.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: Can you tell us more of your thoughts on the state of Web
Services?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: It depends what you mean by &ldquo;Web Services&rdquo;.  There are two
core ideas, taken from the Web (hence the name).  First, instead of
trying to define APIs across networks, you specify the messages that
are exchanged, and second, that XML is a decent data format for the
messages.  I personally believe both, and this is the only sane way to
integrate applications in a heterogeneous environment.  Unfortunately,
the attempt to standardize this excellent idea, under the WS-*
label, has gone off the rails.  It is insanely complex, baroque and
abstracted, and implementing it requires reading hundreds of pages of
poorly written, unstable specs and dealing with ferocious inter-vendor
politics.  Fortunately for the future, there is a rock-solid base of
proven, efficient, scalable, standardized technology: HTTP, XML and
so on, and some very clear guidance on how to do things: REST.  So,
I expect WS-* to fall far short of expectations, but Web Services,
done more simply, to be the default way of doing things in the
future.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: What is your take on the Java/OSS debate?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: I'm not 100% convinced that an OSS license for Java will bring that
much engineering benefit.  One of the biggest benefits of open source
is that bugs are caught and fixed more quickly.  But &ldquo;Java&rdquo;
is defined as &ldquo;a
binary that passes the TCK&rdquo;, and that's worked well; the Java community
likes it, and that's how it's going to stay.  So I'm not sure that
it's reasonable to expect the open-source &ldquo;release early, release
often&rdquo;
culture to come to Java.  On the other hand, Java's licensing has been a
cultural obstacle to a lot of people, especially in the Linux space.  One
result is that things like GNOME and KDE are still substantially written
in C++, blecch.  So I'm optimistic that a real open-source license will
eventually empower the developers of the non-Microsoft desktop.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: You are a big fan of Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  What is it about them
that interests you?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: In fact, I'm a fan of dynamic languages in general&mdash;my own Weblogging
system is written mostly in Perl.  To my eye, Ruby and Python stand out
from the crowd of such languages in that they seem useful for building
large, ambitious software projects as well as the quick one-offs that
&ldquo;scripting&rdquo; languages have traditionally been used for.  Speaking
personally, I find Ruby a bit more pleasing than Python, but the margin
is at best 55/45; there are areas where Python is more attractive.
I don't think either is going to wipe out the other.  Rails seems
special; in its sweet spot, maintainable Web apps with a low barrier to
entry, it seems like it's set a new standard.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: What is your take on the state of PHP?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: Aesthetically speaking, I don't like PHP.  I am told that its
top-level namespace has 5,000 functions, which is sort of
mind-boggling.  On the other hand, I've seen how it's empowered legions
of people, many without a lot of formal training, to get very usable Web
apps on the air quickly.  And its scaling story is impressive: anything
that runs the infrastructure for Yahoo! Finance deserves respect.  Still,
whenever I'm asked to look at actual PHP code, chances are it'll
be an unmaintainable mess: spaghetti SQL wrapped in spaghetti PHP wrapped
in spaghetti HTML.  I think that what we'd like, ideally, is something
that has PHP's ease-of-use and scaling advantages, but is more effective
at separation of concerns and maintainability.  Something like Rails
or Django.  And, Java EE is moving in that direction fast with release 5.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: The Weblog you mentioned above at <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing" target="_self">www.tbray.org/ongoing</a>&mdash;what
is your mission with it?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: No mission whatsoever.  I like being able to talk to the world,
and even more, I like having the world talk back to me.  I'm naturally
a fast writer with lots of strong opinions, and it turns out that (for
the last couple of years anyhow) a lot of other people are interested
in the same things I am.  It also gives me a place to post my pictures
and talk about politics and music and books and so on.  I'll confess
that there have been a few occasions when I've deliberately tried to
write something to appeal to a big audience or make an impact, and
it never works.  I totally can't predict which of my pieces will get
Slashdotted and which will sink without a trace.  So I just write about
what I care about.  Sometimes people ask me to write about
something&mdash;sometimes people at Sun, sometimes from elsewhere; sometimes I say yes,
sometimes no, based on whether it's interesting or not.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: The potential for everyone to participate in the Internet experience
seems to be an important issue for you.  In fact, you've written that
&ldquo;The Net itself is a contribution, by humanity to humanity, the engine
of future contribution and experience.&rdquo; What do you think it will
take to make your vision of a truly accessible and egalitarian Internet
into reality?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: I'm 100% in favor of making the Net &ldquo;accessible&rdquo;, but I don't think
either the Net or the world are particularly egalitarian.  The only
equality you can hope for, really, is equality of opportunity.  Take
blogging for example.  Not everyone likes writing, not everyone writes
well and not everyone writes quickly.  Having said all that, I think
that a lot more people could be participating than are right now, and
the biggest barrier to entry is the lousy quality of the tools.  I
think that to improve the quality of the creative experience, we need
to get some standard protocols in place, which is why I'm so enthused
about the APP.
</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>
<i>LJ</i>: All right, since this is <i>Linux Journal</i>, we need to
ask at least have one
pure Linux question before we close, okay? What is your favorite Linux
distribution?</em></span>
</p><p>
TB: My favorite distro is Ubuntu, although the server/firewall box in
my basement is basic Debian, and I'm happy with that too.
