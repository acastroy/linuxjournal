This &ldquo;how we did it&rdquo; story includes valuable tips for building
an intranet that integrates enterprise services in a user-friendly way.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb5580.0x1fad2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Intranets have been around for a long time.  They were one of the
first alternate uses for World Wide Web technology back in the early
1990s.  The idea of bringing a little bit of the Web experience
in-house was very attractive, but integration with existing systems was
difficult.  Thus, a lot of intranets were nothing more than glorified
bulletin boards with some user-publishing features thrown in.  The
landscape is different now, with open-source software ready to take
most of the cost and some of the complexity away from a good intranet
setup.  The so-called LAMP stack provides the perfect neutral platform
for integrating many different pieces of software into a single point
of interaction for users.  That's what we have tried to do at our company.
</p><p>
Our intranet started off in 1999 as a Web-based bulletin board and company
calendar on a Red Hat 6.0 server running Apache.  It was a static HTML
site that was designed and kept current by our marketing manager.  After
she left the company in 2002, we needed to make the intranet more dynamic
so that it didn't depend on one person to keep it up to date.  As
is usually the case, we added more and more features over the years
and now have a very useful, user-friendly intranet site without a lot
of unnecessary or static content that needs to be maintained.  In this
article, I use our intranet as an example of how to solve
four of the more common integration tasks that small business admins
may run into when setting up a LAMP-based intranet.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb5580.0x1fad450"></a>
Technical Overview</h2></div></div><p>
Our intranet currently serves about 70 employees and runs on an IBM
x335 server running Fedora Core 4.  We use a normal LAMP stack (Linux,
Apache 1.3x, MySQL and Perl) with mod_perl to improve performance.  Apache
currently shares the server with our e-mail scanner, internal DNS, Jabber,
Samba and some other services.  It's nice having all of this running on
a single Linux server, because it reduces the need for NFS mounts and
cuts down on network traffic.  Some sites will be too large for this
approach, but nothing in our design would preclude it from working in
a multiserver setup.  All of our users run Windows XP and authenticate
through Active Directory.  We use GroupWise as our e-mail software running
on a NetWare 6 server, and all of its information is handled by Novell's
eDirectory.  We also have a time and billing system that runs on a Windows
NT 4.0 server and stores its data in a Microsoft SQL Server database.  You
can see a layout of how everything links together in Figure 1.

Figure 1. How Our Enterprise Services Are Connected
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb5580.0x1fad710"></a>
Server-Side Credentialing</h2></div></div><p>
We decided early on that our users shouldn't have to authenticate in any
way to our intranet.  The site should automatically &ldquo;know&rdquo; who they are
based on their IP address and information gleaned from the network about
who is currently logged in from that address.  We call this technique
server-side credentialing (SSC).  We accomplished this originally by using
a piece of custom-written client-side software that was contacted by a CGI
script any time the server needed to check a user's identity.  This works,
but it places too much trust on the client side.  A sniffer and a Perl
script could fake a user's identity nicely from any client computer.  We
now use Samba and winbindd for this task.
</p><p>
Because our intranet server resides on a trusted internal network, it is
privy to the current state of affairs on the network, including who
is logged in from where.  Every computer in the office maps a drive
letter to the Samba server during login, so any time the server needs
the current user's identity, it simply looks up his or her IP address in the
Samba connection list.  The mapped drive is just a dummy drive explicitly
for the SSC mechanism.  I think this is an important feature, because
it lowers the complexity of the site from a programming standpoint and
allows users to browse freely without having to worry about registering
or logging in.  Users have enough user names and passwords to keep track
of already without us adding to their burden.
</p><p>
The way you set up SSC depends on how your users authenticate on your
network.  We use Active Directory, so that is what I demonstrate
here.  Active Directory is annoying (surprise, surprise), because it
doesn't store connection status information in its directory.  You must
use traditional RPC calls with Samba's net command to get reliable
results.  Our SSC script is called smbconn.sh, and it looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

net status sessions parseable              \
| grep -i "\\\\$1\\\\"                     \
| sed 's/^.*\\\(.*\)\\.*\\.*\\.*$/\1/g'    \
| sed 's/DOMAIN+//g' | tr -d ' '
</pre>
</p><p>
Pretty simple, eh? Just remember to change DOMAIN to whatever your
Active Directory's domain name is.  This script returns the name of
the user object that is logged in to Samba from the IP address we pass
to it on the command line.  The name it returns corresponds to Active
Directory's sAMAccountName property.  Armed with this information,
we now can run an LDAP lookup to get the user's full name or any
other data we might need.  The script we use to do this is found in
Listing 1.  It will take the user's sAMAccountName as its
first argument and an optional attribute whose value you want returned
as the second argument.  If you don't provide the optional attribute,
the script returns the user's full name.  You <span   class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> do all of this
in a custom mod_perl handler so that its information always would be
available, but this seems like overkill for most sites.  Our site has
only a handful of restricted sections where this information comes into
play,
so we just let each CGI script run it as needed.  Here is a typical SSC
call from one of our CGI scripts:

<pre     class="programlisting">

##: Get this connection's user credentials
my $remoteip=$ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'};

open(SMBCONN,"smbconn.sh $remoteip |");
my $cn=&lt;SMBCONN&gt;;
$cn=~s/\s+//g;    ##: Strip whitespace
close(SMBCONN);

open(GETEMPINFO,"getempinfo.pl $cn |");
my $username=&lt;GETEMPINFO&gt;;
close(GETEMPINFO);
if($username eq "") {
  $username="Guest";
}

</pre>
</p><p>
This section of code leaves us with the user's sAMAccountName in
the $cn variable and the user's full name in the $username
variable.  If the $username variable contains Guest, either the
lookup failed or the computer accessing this CGI script doesn't have a
logged-in user operating it.  We now can use this critical information to
decide whether the user has access to the information this CGI
script is meant to provide.  We also can use this information to return
a page customized for this particular user.  I demonstrate this with
a section of code from the index.cgi file that serves up our home page:

<pre     class="programlisting">

##: My Intranet section
my $mint="";
if(($username eq "Guest") || ($username eq "")) {
  open(EMPSNAP,"./random-employee.pl 2&gt;&amp;1 |");
  my @snap=&lt;EMPSNAP&gt;;
  close(EMPSNAP);
  $mint.=join("\n",@snap);
  chop($mint);
} else {
  $mint.=&amp;get_emp_card($cn);
  $mint.="&lt;b&gt;E-Mail Controls:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n";
  $mint.="&lt;a href='selfserv.cgi'&gt;My Mail&lt;/a&gt;\n";
  ...
}
...
print STDOUT $mint;

</pre>
</p><p>
You can see here that we check to see if the person viewing the home page
is actually a credentialed user.  If he or she is not, we serve up a random
employee's picture and profile in this section of the home page.  If
the person is a credentialed user, we grab the appropriate personal information
from the LDAP directory and proceed to assemble a My Intranet area
in this section of the home page where the user can edit his or her employee
profile, control mail preferences and so forth.  The get_emp_card($cn)
routine simply looks up the user's current info in Active Directory and
returns a nicely formatted HTML section to display it (Figure 2).

Active Directory Integration</h2></div></div><p>
Another valuable addition to our intranet was integrating it with our
Active Directory user database via LDAP. We use this to provide a company
directory that lists all of our employees.  The directory is built in
real time whenever it is accessed, and that is a major time-saver for
administrators.  Whenever new users are added using the normal Active
Directory tools, they instantly show up in the intranet directory.  We
also allow our users to edit their own personal information, and those
edits are put into the Active Directory by the CGI script.  The process is
relatively straightforward, although there are some things to take into
consideration.  Let me walk you through the process of how we set this up.
</p><p>
The first thing we do is create a proxy user called proxyuser in Active
Directory.  This is the user name our scripts use to authenticate with
LDAP.  The proxy user is granted rights to read and write information on
user objects within the ou=Domain Users container.  That's all that
needs to be done within Active Directory.  We use Perl for our CGI, so
that means using Net::LDAP.  Here is how we connect to Active Directory
from within a CGI script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
##: Active Directory connection
use Net::LDAP;

my $ldap=Net::LDAP-&gt;new('adserver.domain.com');
my $mesg=$ldap-&gt;bind('proxyuser@domain.com',
                      password=&gt;'proxyuser'  );
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the syntax that Active Directory requires for the user name
field.  It's one of the unique requirements of Active Directory's LDAP
interface.  Now that we are connected to the directory, we do a query to
find all the user objects in the ou=Domain Users container:

<pre     class="programlisting">
##: Query LDAP to get a list of employees
my $basedn="ou=Domain Users,dc=domain,dc=com";
my $filter="(objectClass=user)";
$mesg=$ldap-&gt;search(
  base=&gt; $basedn,
  filter=&gt; $filter,
  attrs=&gt; ['givenName','sn','mail',
           'telephoneNumber','streetAddress',
           'l','st','department','postalCode',
           'employeeNumber','homePhone',
           'title','sAMAccountName' ]
  );
</pre>
</p><p>
This returns all of the user objects in that container, along with
all of the pertinent attributes you would expect to find in a company
directory.  We now can refine our search filter to limit our search to
only those users whose last name starts with a letter passed to the
CGI script in its URL.  This allows us to follow an address-book format,
so we don't have to display all 70 users at once.  We fall back to the
letter a
if no letter was asked for in the URL:

<pre     class="programlisting">

##: Get letter requested in the URL
my $letter;
$letter=param('letter') || "a";
...
my $filter="(&amp;(objectClass=user) (sn=$letter*))";

</pre>
</p><p>
If you aren't familiar with the syntax used by LDAP search filters,
I suggest you look over RFC-2254.  At this point, we can iterate over our
query results and prettify them as needed.  Because we also looked up this
user's SSC information, we can check each employee's sAMAccountName
as we go through the loop.  When we find the employee that corresponds to
the person SSC says is viewing the page, we add a link by the employee's name
that allows him or her to go to an area to edit the directory
information.  It looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

##: Display the directory
foreach my $entry ($mesg-&gt;sorted('sn')) {

  my $san=$entry-&gt;get_value('sAMAccountName');
  $empdir.="&lt;div class='empcard'&gt;";
  if(lc($cn) eq lc($san)) {
    ##: This is our man.  Add a button.
    $empdir.="&lt;a href='empedit.cgi'&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt;";
  }
  $empdir.="&lt;span id='name'&gt;";
  $empdir.=$entry-&gt;get_value('givenName')." ";
  $empdir.=$entry-&gt;get_value('sn');
  $empdir.="&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;";
  $empdir.="&lt;span id='title'&gt;";
  $empdir.=$entry-&gt;get_value('title').";
  $empdir.="&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;";
  ...
  $empdir.="&lt;/div&gt;";

}
print STDOUT $empdir;
$mesg=$ldap-&gt;unbind();

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1eb5580.0x1fae318"></a>
SpamAssassin and E-mail Integration</h2></div></div><p>
I designed an e-mail gateway for our company back in 2001, and it's still
the system we use today.  I wrote about it in a previous <i  >Linux Journal</i> article in the December 2001 issue.  The system has been modified tremendously since
then, but it still operates in the same basic way.  It's simply a store,
scan and forward agent.  Because this all takes place on our Linux server,
our Windows users were unable to see or retrieve false positives or
have any control over their SpamAssassin whitelists.  We solved this
by building a set of CGI scripts to let our users modify their
SpamAssassin preferences file and release their false positives from
the spam trap on their own, using the intranet as the interface.
</p><p>
Users launch the mail management scripts from their My Intranet
section on our home page (Figure 2).  They choose which day's mail they
want to view from a drop-down box and click a button to activate the
selfserv.cgi script.  There is no user identity information passed to the
script, because it will obtain that information from an SSC lookup.  After
we do the initial SSC lookup, we call the getempinfo.pl script again
to get the current user's e-mail address, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

##: Get this user's email address
open(GETEMPINFO,"-|","getempinfo.pl",$cn,"mail");
my $searchstring=&lt;GETEMPINFO&gt;;
close(GETEMPINFO);

</pre>
</p><p>
The $searchstring variable then becomes the base of the
regular expression we use to search the /spam directory for
spam belonging to this user.  As the mail attribute coming
from Active Directory is something typed in by human hands, we must do
another check to make sure we aren't falling victim to typos:

<pre     class="programlisting">

##: Make sure this email address is valid
unless($searchstring=~/^[a-z]*\@domain\.com$/) {
  print STDOUT "Content-Type: text/plain\n\n";
  print STDOUT "Access Denied: Your identity on \
    the network can't be verified.\n";
  return(0);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
If these checks are successful, the script responds by showing users the
requested day's spam in a table format with a list of option links on
the side of each item (Figure 3).  Users then can use the option links
to have the script release the spam, whitelist its sender, blacklist
its sender, produce a SpamAssasin report or simply display it as plain
text.  The script looks up the user's SSC information each time it's
called and before any action is performed so that it knows whether
or not to allow that action.  I won't get into more detail here, because the
functions of this script consist mostly of just moving files around in
response to users' requests.  I do want to mention the whitelist and
blacklist options though.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="8962f3.large.jpg"><img src="8962f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Options for Handling Trapped Spam
</p></div></div><p>
SpamAssassin holds its per-user configuration data in a file named
.spamassassin/user_prefs.cf in each user's home directory.  In a normal
setup, where Linux is your main mail server, this is fine, but in our
case,
it won't work.  Our Linux server is merely a scanning gateway that relays
mail in and out, so it has no awareness of our users or their e-mail
accounts.  To solve this, we have to cheat a little.  SpamAssassin's main
configuration file is named /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf, and it
reads this file every time it's started.  It doesn't read only that file
though.  It actually reads all files in the /etc/mail/spamassasssin
directory that have a .cf extension.  We can use this to our
advantage and have our CGI script create files in this directory for
each user's whitelist in a $cn_prefs.cf format.  We have a cron job
that restarts spamd every hour anyway to free memory, so this works out
fine.  The most important thing to remember if you use this method is
that you have to do strict syntax checking to make sure users aren't
whitelisting things like *@hotmail.com or using any other SpamAssassin
directives.  Even though these files have the appearance of private
preference files to users, they actually are global to SpamAssassin,
because they reside in the main config directory.

Microsoft SQL Server Integration</h2></div></div><p>
Our firm uses a time and billing system called CPAS.  This software package
holds all of our client and billing information as well as information
used by our marketing manager to assemble mass mail-outs to our clients.  We
wanted to give our users access to this information to do some rudimentary
data mining without having to contact administration every time.  Because
CPAS stores its information in a Microsoft SQL Server database, we had
to use a piece of software called FreeTDS and the DBD::Sybase package
from CPAN to interface to it from our Perl CGI scripts.
</p><p>
Four steps are involved in setting this up.  The first thing to do
is grab the latest FreeTDS package from the Internet and unpack the
tarball.  Next, <tt  >cd</tt> into the unpacked directory, and execute the following
commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/freetds
&gt; make
&gt; su -c 'make install'
</pre>
</p><p>
This sets up FreeTDS in its own directory, so it's easier for
the Sybase module to find later.  Next, we go into CPAN and get the
DBD::Sybase package.  Become root and execute the following commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; perl -MCPAN -e shell
&gt; install DBD::Sybase
</pre>
</p><p>
Feel free to force the install if some of the tests fail&mdash;that is pretty
common according to the package's author.  At this point, the software
is installed, but we have to set up the FreeTDS configuration file.  This
file holds information about the databases to which you will be connecting.  The
configuration file is well documented, and you should be able to figure
out the syntax easily.  Here is a sample server entry:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[JACKSON5]
    host = jackson5.domain.com
    port = 1433
    tds version = 4.2
</pre>
</p><p>
Once FreeTDS is configured, you can access your database from your CGI
scripts through the familiar DBI interface in Perl.  Here is an example
connection to a database called concerts running on a Windows server
named JACKSON5:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use DBI; $ENV{'SYBASE'} = '/usr/local/freetds';
$dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('dbi:Sybase:server=JACKSON5', 'username', 'password')
    or die 'connect';
$dbh-&gt;do("use concerts");
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that you have to put the location of your FreeTDS installation in
an environment variable before you attempt a connection.  The environment
variable tells DBD::Sybase where to find the FreeTDS libraries.  After
that, you simply perform your queries as usual using DBI.  If you are used to
working with MySQL, I suggest you study up on the syntax used by Microsoft
SQL Server.  Some of it is very different from what you are used to.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I hope this article gives you some ideas and practical knowledge on how
to better integrate your intranet with some of the more common systems
found in a small business.  An intranet shouldn't be only a news portal or
electronic bulletin board.  It should be an interactive tool for users
and a time-saver for administrators.  Users feel a level of comfort in a
browser environment that they don't feel when searching through a filesystem
or staring at a command line.  Take advantage of that and your intranet
will become a valuable asset to your business.
