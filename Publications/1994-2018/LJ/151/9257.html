If you want an easy way to calculate the amount of data transferred from
a log file, you can always look awk-ward.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x213a580.0x22323a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we spent a lot of time digging around in the
Apache log files to see how you can use basic Linux
commands to ascertain some basic statistics about your Web
site.
</p><p>
You'll recall that even simple commands, such as head, tail
and wc can help you figure out things like hits per hour
and, coupled with some judicious uses of grep, can show
you how many graphics you sent, which HTML files were most
popular and so on.
</p><p>
More important, utilizing awk at its most rudimentary
made it easy to cut out a specific column of information
and see that different fields of a standard Apache log file
entry have different values.  This month, I dig
further into the log files and explore how you can utilize
more sophisticated scripting to ascertain total bytes
transferred for a given time unit.

How Much Data Have You Transferred?</h2></div></div><p>
Many ISPs have a maximum allocation for your monthly
bandwidth, so it's important to be able to figure out how
much data you've sent.  Let's examine a single log file entry
to see where the bytes-sent field is found:

<pre     class="programlisting">
72.82.44.66 - - [11/Jul/2006:22:15:14 -0600] "GET
&#8618;/individual-entry-javascript.js HTTP/1.1" 200 2374
&#8618;"http://www.askdavetaylor.com/
&#8618;sync_motorola_razr_v3c_with_windows_xp_via_bluetooth.html"
&#8618;"Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0;
&#8618;Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR
&#8618;2.0.50727)"
</pre>
</p><p>
There are a lot of different fields of data here, but the one we want is
field #10, which in this instance is 2374.  Double-check
on the filesystem, and you'll find out that this is the
size, in bytes, of the file sent, whether it be a graphic, HTML
file or, as in this case, a JavaScript include file.
</p><p>
Therefore, if you can extract all the field #10 values in
the log file and summarize them, you can figure out total
bytes transferred.  Extracting the field is easy; adding it
all up is trickier, however:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ awk '{ print $10 }' access_log
</pre>
</p><p>
That gets us all the transfer sizes, and we can use awk's
capabilities to make summarizing a single-line command too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ awk '{ sum += $10 } END { print sum }' access_log
</pre>
</p><p>
As I have said before, awk has lots of power for
those people willing to spend a little time learning its
ins and outs.  Notice a lazy shortcut here: I'm not
initializing the variable sum, just exploiting the fact
that variables, when first allocated in awk, are set to
zero.  Not all scripting languages offer this shortcut!
</p><p>
Anyway, run this little one-liner on an access log, and you
can see the total number of bytes transferred: 354406825.  I
can divide that out by 1024 to figure out kilobytes,
megabytes and so on, but that's not useful information until we
can figure out one more thing: what length of time is this
covering?
</p><p>
We can calculate elapsed time by looking at the first and
last lines of the log file and calculating the difference,
or we simply can use grep to pull one day's worth of data
out of the log file and then multiply the result by 30 to get a
running average monthly transfer rate.
</p><p>
Look back at the log file entry; the date is formatted
like so: <tt  >- [11/Jul/2006:22:15:14 -0600]</tt>.  Ignore everything
other than the fact that the date format is DD/MMM/YYYY.
</p><p>
I'll test it with 08/Aug/2006 to pull out just that one
day's worth of log entries and then feed it into the awk
script:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ grep "08/Aug/2006" access_log | awk '{ sum += $10 }
&#8618;END { print sum }'
78233022
</pre>
</p><p>
Just a very rough estimate: 78MB.  Multiply that by 30 and
we'll get 2.3GB for that Web site's monthly data transfer
rate.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x213a580.0x2232b30"></a>
Turning This into a Shell Script</h2></div></div><p>
Now, let's turn this into an actual shell script.  What I'd
like to do is pull out the previous day's data from the log
file and automatically multiply it by 30, so any time the
command is run, we can get a rough idea of the monthly data
transfer rate.
</p><p>
The first step is to do some date math.  I am going to make
the rash assumption that you have GNU date on your system,
which allows date math.  If not, well, that's beyond the
scope of this piece, though I do talk about it in my book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Wicked Cool Shell Scripts</em></span> (<a href="http://www.intuitive.com/wicked" target="_self">www.intuitive.com/wicked</a>).
</p><p>
GNU date lets you back up arbitrary time units by using the
-v option, with modifiers.  To back up a day, use
<tt  >-v-1d</tt>.
For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date
Wed Aug  9 01:00:00 GMT 2006
$ date -v-1d
Tue Aug  8 01:00:47 GMT 2006
</pre>
</p><p>
The other neat trick the date command can do is to
print its output in whatever format you need, using the
many, many options detailed in the strftime(3) man page.  To
get DD/MMM/YYYY, we add a format string:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ date -v-1d +%d/%b/%Y
08/Aug/2006
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's start pulling the script together.  The first step
in the script is to create this date string so we can use
it for the grep call, then go ahead and extract and
summarize the bytes transferred that day.  Next, we can use
those values to calculate other values with the expr
command, saving everything in variables so we can have some
readable output at the end.
</p><p>
Here's my script, with just a little bit of fancy footwork:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

LOGFILE="/home/limbo1/logs/intuitive/access_log"

yesterday="$(date -v-1d +%d/%b/%Y)"

# total number of "hits" and "bytes" yesterday:

hits="$(grep "$yesterday" $LOGFILE | wc -l)"

bytes="$(grep "$yesterday" $LOGFILE | awk '{ sum += $10 }
END { print sum }')"

# now let's play with the data just a bit

avgbytes="$(expr $bytes / $hits )"
monthbytes="$(expr $bytes \* 30 )"

# calculated, let's now display the results:

echo "Calculating transfer data for $yesterday"
echo "Sent $bytes bytes of data across $hits hits"
echo "For an average of $avgbytes bytes/hit"
echo "Estimated monthly transfer rate: $monthbytes"

exit 0
</pre>
</p><p>
Run the script, and here's the kind of data you'll get
(once you point the LOGFILE variable to your own log):

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ./transferred.sh
Calculating transfer data for 08/Aug/2006
Sent 78233022 bytes of data across 15093 hits
For an average of 5183 bytes/hit
Estimated monthly transfer rate: 2346990660
</pre>
</p><p>
We've run out of space this month, but next month, we'll go
back to this script and add some code to have the transfer
rates displayed in megabytes or, if that's still too big,
gigabytes.  After all, an estimated monthly transfer rate of
2346990660 is a value that only a true geek could love!
