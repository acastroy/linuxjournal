Parallel Computing</h4><p>
Your column in the September 2006 issue [see Nicholas Petreley's
&ldquo;Parallel Is Coming into Its Own&rdquo;], and the issue itself, was
inspiring, and I found myself blogging away on the topic: (<a href="http://bitratchet.prweblogs.com" target="_self">bitratchet.prweblogs.com</a>).

When Good Enough Is Good Enough</h4><p>
Great comments by Dave Taylor [see Dave's Work the Shell column in the
September 2006 issue].  I think his Blackjack script exercise was
perfect for the large audience he addressed, no matter what some purists
think about the endless pursuit of &ldquo;perfection&rdquo; in an imperfect world.
</p><p>
Those of you as ancient as I may recall something Gerald Weinberg passed along
in <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Psychology of Computer Programming</em></span> (ISBN
0-442-29264-3): &ldquo;...it is often and truly said that 'any program
that works is better than any program that doesn't'&rdquo;
(p. 17 under section &ldquo;Specifications&rdquo; in my version).
</p><p>
Give 'em hell, Dave. You're right on the money in my book.

64-Bit JMP for Linux</h4><p>
FYI: in the September 2006 issue, Erin Vang of SAS states that R is the only
statistical software available on the Linux desktop other than SAS's JMP
product.  However, as I'm surrounded by folks who use SAS's main competition, I
recently went looking for open-source tools that might work well with SPSS
(Statistical Package for the Social Sciences).  My search turned up the GNU PSPP
page (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/pspp" target="_self">www.gnu.org/software/pspp</a>),
which claims:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
PSPP is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data.  It
interprets commands in the SPSS language and produces tabular
output in ASCII, PostScript or HTML format.
</p><p>
PSPP development is ongoing. It already supports a large subset
of SPSS's transformation language.  Its statistical procedure
support is currently limited, but growing.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Although perhaps not as far along as other efforts, there is at least one
package other than R.  (I cannot comment much on how well PSPP compares
to JMP or R, as I have only recently installed it and have never worked
with either R or SAS software.)

The Dark Age of <i  >Linux Journal</i></h4><p>
First, let me make it quite clear that I have no intention of
canceling my subscription.  Being a reader, collector and subscriber of
<i  >LJ</i> since its very beginning is a honour that I will
not give up that easily.  But after reading an extensive letter of support
in last month's issue, I felt compelled and obligated to write an as long
(or longer) letter pointing to the fact that this is the worst age
ever of this magazine.  An age, for example, when Marcel Gagn&eacute;'s articles
are not any longer the by-far-worst articles in any issue.
</p><p>
In that regard, up to a few months ago&mdash;before these Dark Ages of
<i  >LJ</i>&mdash;reading &ldquo;Monsieur&rdquo; Gagn&eacute;'s
articles was a simple exercise of skipping the first two annoying, dull
and repetitive paragraphs of his every article.  From what it seemed,
Mr Gagn&eacute; uncreatively cut and pasted ad nausea his same little wine
cellar story from previous articles.  Fair enough&mdash;all one had to do was
skip straight to the third paragraph, where the &ldquo;good&rdquo; (or at least
the &ldquo;better&rdquo;) part could be found.
</p><p>
Nowadays, to find a &ldquo;better part&rdquo; of his article, one must
skip two or three <span   class="emphasis"><em>pages</em></span> and usually a comfort
happens only if one can find a good advertisement&mdash;that is, not
necessarily will he/she find comfort in the next also-bad article.
</p><p>
   But Monsieur Gagn&eacute;'s articles have never been the chief car of the
magazine.  Such role is more reasonably expected from, for example,
Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall, whose article this month could only be more patronizing
than it is offensive to a certain &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; Portuguese-speaking country.
Apparently, Mr Hall has visited many countries in the world, but he
hasn't learned much about them, and he still belittles their inhabitants
as uncivilized, uncultured and almost retarded people.  In fact, I
dare not ask which country he is referring to in his article out of
fear that it may be the one where I was born.  Nevertheless, the article
in question was so childish and the dialogue reproduced therein was so
painfully disconnected, pointless and senseless that I may now finally
understand the reason for Jon Hall's middle (nick) name.
</p><p>
When things seemed bad enough, I found Dave Taylor's excuses on why his codes
are so badly inefficient and yet that one should still buy or read his books and
articles.  In a pathetic attempt to justify himself and his apparently highly
criticised lack of programming skills, Mr Taylor went over and over arguing
that being a bad programmer and trying to find the easy way out is
&ldquo;okay&rdquo;&mdash;as
long as you make the proper citations, as he did in his cheating episode at
UCSD.
</p><p>
His attempt to justify the unjustifiable could only be as degrading
to oneself as the Chief Editor's, Nick Petreley, constant rebuttals to
the now-so-common letters of criticisms.  After all, a Chief Editor who
spends his time and talent (?!) to write notes in defense to what he had
already defended in the first place (in the original article) only shows
a pattern of patent and spread unpreparedness of the current staff at
<i  >LJ</i>.
</p><p>
I cannot really expect you to publish this letter, and I can only hope
that you won't publish its parts in a distorted way in which
<span   class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> may
sound dull and unprepared.  However, I would be happy to know that my
words above made you think, at least for a brief, unexpected moment.
That my criticism made you (and the others to whom I am Cc'ing this
message) re-evaluate what can be wrong in the magazine's new direction.
</p><p>
I, as anyone else, cannot assign all the blame of the current errant
trend to one single person.  However, when people waste pages of the
magazine defending themselves&mdash;as Mr Taylor did and the CE frequently
does&mdash;one starts to wonder about the coincidence of dates between this
new Dark Age and the change of personnel.  Either way, I still long for the
days when Mr Gagn&eacute;'s article would&mdash;despite the boring
beginnings&mdash;concentrate on the importance for our health of breaks after long uses
of the computer and the availability of many software to help with
that.  Instead, we now find endless reports of one silly and specific
Disney-like software for that purpose.  Or still, two articles in the
same year talking about &ldquo;cool applets for KDE&rdquo;.  I miss the days when
Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall's stories in the magazine would justify his middle
name solely because of his daring, bold and yet brilliant views of
a different future for the software industry, rather than his current
picturesque experiences with last-century native people of
&ldquo;Neverland&rdquo;
(at least, that is how Mr Hall seems to imagine them).
</p><p>
Bottom line is: I hope this magazine finds its way back to being a
technically rich magazine, on which people, like me, relied to read good
articles: nothing more, nothing less, nothing possibly better.

Guilherme DeSouza  <br><br>
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dave Taylor replies:</b></span>
</p><p>
Thanks for your note and your passionate enthusiasm for the publication,
Guilherme.  I can appreciate your desire for a more technical publication
and your perspective on our editorial content, though I don't agree with
it.  Linux, and, by extension, software development itself, is about far
more than just the lines of code.  As demonstrated by the increasingly
political Open Source movement, software now is the cog in the machine
of commerce and as the journal of record for the Linux community, I'm
proud to help offer perspectives on both the detailed geek stuff of
coding and the rest of the picture.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Jon &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall replies</b></span>
</p><p>
I am a little shocked that you felt my article was &ldquo;patronizing and
offensive&rdquo;.
The scene, by the way, is Brazil.  I mention real towns in it, real
places and even real people (although I sometimes substitute people
from Mexico and other countries).  I follow this habit from one of my
favorite cartoonists of all time, Walt Kelly (Pogo), who often put the
names of people he had not seen for a while in his comic strip, just to
let them know he was thinking of them.
</p><p>
The column is supposed to impart a transferral of knowledge.  Most of
the time the knowledge comes from me, but I also try to bring in some of
the issues from the other people.  A lot of the people I am &ldquo;talking
to&rdquo;
in the magazine are younger people, whose life skills are not as vast as
an older person, and this would be true in any culture.  If this appears
to you to be condescending to the culture, I assure you that it is not
meant to be that way.
</p><p>
I have also had people thank me for trying to bring back to the technical
and commercial world the fact that Free Software is supposed to be
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span>.
</p><p>
Finally, I chose the place and the setting because I
<span   class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span> going there,
and I <span   class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span> the people.  I will be going to an event called OpenBeach
in Florianopolis, Brazil (the setting of the Beachhead) for the fourth
time this year.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
      Marcel Gagn&eacute; replies:</b></span>
</p><p>
I write for a very different audience than Mr DeSouza would have
me address.
I believe that Linux and open source is good for people, all people,
including the ones who want to do cool things with their desktops.  I've
written six books, several hundred articles and I'm coming up on seven
years of Cooking with Linux.  I keep writing Cooking with Linux, complete
with Francois and my wine cellar, because people enjoy reading it.  If
they didn't, I would take a different tack.  With a very few exceptions
(such as Mr DeSouza), I get nothing but praise for my articles.
</p><p>
I want <span   class="emphasis"><em>everybody</em></span> using Linux, not just hard-core techies.  Computers
aren't magic and neither is software.  Sometimes I feel that if we
can't reach out to the average person, explain things in simple terms
whenever possible, and make it fun for them, we aren't doing our
jobs right.  If offering up a wine suggestion with every column makes my
discussion of desktop backup solutions, multimedia jukeboxes,
panel applets, desktop search engines and so forth more fun, then so be it.
</p><p>
Mr DeSouza has every right to express his feelings, whether I agree
with them or not (and I don't), but I'm not writing for him.  Apparently,
none of us are.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Nicholas Petreley replies:</b></span>
</p><p>
I'll take your advice and decline to defend the fact that I've written
rebuttals in response to some critical letters.
