Many programmers, myself included, have long seen JavaScript as a way
to change the appearance of a page of HTML dynamically or to perform
relatively minor tasks, such as checking the validity of a form.  In
the past year, however, JavaScript has emerged as a major force for
application developers, providing the infrastructure for so-called
Ajax applications.
</p><p>
Before JavaScript, there was a one-to-one correspondence between user
actions and the display of HTML pages.  If a user clicked on a link, the
currently displayed page disappeared and was replaced with another
page of HTML.  If a user submitted an HTML form, the contents of that
form were submitted to a program on the Web server, and the content
of the server's response was then displayed in the browser, replacing
its predecessor.  In traditional Web applications, server-side
programs handle the bulk of user input and also build any dynamically
generated Web pages the user might see.
</p><p>
Ajax applications redistribute the load, putting a greater emphasis on
client-side JavaScript.  In an Ajax application, many server-side
programs do indeed produce complete pages of HTML, which are then
displayed in their entirety in a Web browser.  But many other
server-side programs produce small snippets of XML-formatted data.
This data is both requested and used by client-side JavaScript to
modify and update the current HTML page without having to refresh or
replace it.  Using Web standards, such as the DOM (document object
model) and CSS (cascading stylesheets), Ajax applications can
approach the usability, friendliness and instant feedback that people
expect from desktop applications.
</p><p>
This month, we continue exploring client-side
JavaScript and Ajax, which we began during the past few months.  Last
month's column looked at a user-registration application for a Web
site.  Although the actual registration took place in a server-side
program, we looked at ways in which we could provide an Ajax-style
warning for registering users who wanted a user name that was already
taken.  Sure, we could have the server-side registration program check
to see whether the user name had been taken already, but that would require
refreshing the page, which also requires a delay.
</p><p>
The solution we implemented last month was fine from the user's
perspective (especially if the user has somewhat Spartan tastes in
design), but it solved the problem in a very non-Ajax way&mdash;by
hard-coding the user names in a JavaScript array and then looking for
the desired new user name in that array.  This approach has a number of
large problems associated with it, starting with the fact that the
full list of user names is available to anyone looking at the HTML
source and ending with the fact that the array will become unwieldy
and cumbersome over time, taking an increasingly long time to download and
search through as the number of registered users grows.
</p><p>
We can avoid these problems by using an Ajax-style solution.  Rather
than hard-code the list of user names in the JavaScript, and instead of
having the server-side program produce a full list of user names,
perhaps we could simply send a request to the server, checking to see
if the requested user name is already taken.  This will result in
relatively fast download and reaction times, in a cleaner application
design and in an extensible application.
</p><p>
This month, we take the Ajax plunge, modifying the server- and
client-side programs we wrote last month to retrieve user names
via an asynchronous request from the server.  In producing this
application, we will see how relatively straightforward it can be to
create an Ajax application or to integrate Ajax functionality into a
traditional Web application.  By the end of this article, you should
understand how to create the client and server sides of an Ajax
application.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1911580.0x1a09660"></a>
Making an Ajax Call</h2></div></div><p>
The technology that makes much of Ajax possible is JavaScript's
XMLHttpRequest object.  Using this object, a JavaScript function can
make HTTP requests to a server and act on the results.  (For security
reasons, HTTP requests made by XMLHttpRequest must be sent to the
server from which the current Web page was loaded.) The HTTP request
may use either the GET or POST method, the latter of which
allows us to send arbitrarily long, complex content to the server.
</p><p>
Most interesting, and at the core of many Ajax paradigms, is the fact
that XMLHttpRequest may make its HTTP requests synchronously (forcing
the browser to wait until the response has been completely received)
or asynchronously (allowing the user to continue to use the browser
window as it downloads additional information).  Ajax applications
typically use asynchronous calls.  This allows different parts of the
Web page to be updated and modified independently of one other,
potentially responding simultaneously to multiple user inputs.
</p><p>
Ideally, we would be able to create an instance of XMLHttpRequest with
the following JavaScript code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
</pre>
</p><p>
Unfortunately, life isn't that simple.  This is because many people
use Internet Explorer as their primary browser.  IE does not have a
native XMLHttpRequest object, and thus it cannot be instantiated in this
way.  Rather, it must be instantiated as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var xhr = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP");
</pre>
</p><p>
But wait! There are also some IE versions that require a slightly
different syntax:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var xhr = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");
</pre>
</p><p>
How are we going to handle these three different ways of instantiating
XMLHttpObject? One way is to use server-side browser detection.  It
is also possible to use client-side browser detection.  But the most
elegant method I have seen to date comes from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ajax Design
Patterns</em></span>, a new book by Michael Mahemoff (published by O'Reilly Media).
Mahemoff uses JavaScript's exception-handling system to try each of these in
turn until it works.  By wrapping our three different instantiation
methods in a function, and then assigning the value of our xhr
variable to whatever the function returns, we can give our application
cross-platform compatibility:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function getXMLHttpRequest () {
try { return new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP"); } catch(e) {};
try { return new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"); } catch(e) {}
try { return new XMLHttpRequest(); } catch(e) {};
    return null;
}

var xhr = getXMLHttpRequest();
</pre>
</p><p>
After executing the above code, we can be sure that xhr is either null
(indicating that all attempts to instantiate XMLHttpRequest failed) or
contains a valid instance of XMLHttpRequest.  Once instantiated,
XMLHttpRequest is compatible across browsers and platforms.  The same
methods thus will apply for all systems.
</p><p>
The most common method to call on xhr is open, which tells the
object to send an HTTP request to a particular URL on the originating
server.  A call to xhr.open looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xhr.open("GET", "foo.html", true);
</pre>
</p><p>
The first parameter (GET) tells xhr.open that we want to use the
HTTP GET method.  The second parameter names the URL that we want to
retrieve; notice that because we must connect to the originating
server, the initial protocol and hostname part of the URL is missing.
The third parameter indicates whether the call is asynchronous
(true) or synchronous (false).  Almost all Ajax applications pass
true, as this means that the browser doesn't freeze up while it
is waiting for the HTTP response.  This ability to make asynchronous
HTTP requests is central to the magic of Ajax.  Because the HTTP
request doesn't affect the user interface and is handled in the
background, the Web application feels more like a desktop application.
</p><p>
The call to xhr.open() does not actually send the HTTP request.
Rather, it sets up the object so that when the request is sent, it
uses the specified request method and parameters.  To send the request
to the server, we use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xhr.send(null);
</pre>
</p><p>
XMLHttpRequest does not return the HTTP response whoever calls
xhr.send(). This is because we are using XMLHttpRequest
<span   class="emphasis"><em>asynchronously</em></span>, as specified with the true value to xhr.open().
We cannot predict whether we will get results in half a second, five
seconds, one minute or ten hours.
</p><p>
Instead, we tell JavaScript to invoke a function when it receives the
HTTP response.  This function will be responsible for reading and
parsing the response and then taking appropriate action.  One simple
version of the function, which I have called parseHttpResponse, is as
follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function parseHttpResponse() {
    alert("entered parseHttpResponse");
    if (xhr.readyState == 4) {
        alert("readystate == 4");
        if (xhr.status == 200) {
            alert(xhr.responseText);
        }
        else
        {
            alert("xhr.status == " + xhr.status);
        }
    }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
parseHttpResponse is called when the HTTP response to our Ajax request
comes in.  However, we have to make sure that the response contents
have completely arrived, which we do by monitoring xhr.readyState.
When that equals 4, we know that xhr has received the complete
response.  Our next step is then to check that the response had an
HTTP &ldquo;OK&rdquo; (200) code.  After all, it is always possible that we got a
404 (&ldquo;file missing&rdquo;) error from the server, or that we failed to
connect to the server at all.
</p><p>
To tell JavaScript we want to invoke parseHttpResponse when our
HTTP request returns, we set the onreadystatechange attribute in our
XMLHttpRequest object:

<pre     class="programlisting">
xhr.onreadystatechange = parseHttpResponse;
</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, after we can be sure that we have received the response and
that all is well, we can grab the text of the response with the
xhr.responseText method.  Our XMLHttpRequest can return its response
either as a text string (as here) or as an XML document.  In the latter
case, we then can use the DOM to navigate through it, much as we would
do with a Web page.
</p><p>
Of course, an actual Ajax application would not issue an alert at
every step of its execution and would probably do something more
useful&mdash;perhaps changing some text, adding or removing some nodes from the
document tree or changing part of the document's stylesheet.
Nevertheless, you can see this code in action in Listing 1
(ajax-test.html).

Note that ajax-test.html, although simple, is a fully working Ajax
program.  In order for it to work, you need to have a file named
atf.html in the DocumentRoot directory of your Web site.
(Otherwise, you will get an HTTP response code of 404.)
If you've
ever wondered how hard it is to perform an Ajax call, you now can see
that it's relatively simple.

Adding Ajax to Registration</h2></div></div><p>
Now that we have seen how an Ajax program works, let's use this
knowledge to modify the registration program that we built last month.
Our old registration page defined a list of user names in the
JavaScript.  If the user's requested user name was a member of that
list, we alert the user to the error and forbid the user from actually
registering.
</p><p>
I won't describe all of the problems with this approach, as
there are many.  As a simple alternative, what if we were to use Ajax
to retrieve the list of user names? That way, we could be sure that
the list was up to date.
</p><p>
What if, instead of having the array contents hard-coded, we were to
download them from a Web page on the server? (This is admittedly not as
sophisticated as getting a yes or no answer to a specific
user name; we will get to that functionality in next month's column.)
If the Ajax-retrieved list of user names was generated dynamically,
we could have it grab appropriate data from the database and
then return an XML document that easily could be turned into an array.
To make the example easier in this month's column, we don't use a
dynamic page, but rather a static one.  However, if you have done any
server-side Web programming in the past, you probably will understand
how to take our file, usernames.txt (Listing 2), and turn it into a
dynamic page.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1911580.0x1a0a4d0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 2. usernames.txt</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre></div><p>
A registration page that follows this principle is shown in Listing 3.  That
file, ajax-register.html, is similar to the registration form we
created last month.  In last month's non-Ajax version, we defined an
array (usernames).  We then defined a checkUsername function that is
invoked by the onchange handler for the username text field.  This
had the effect of invoking checkUsername when the user completed the
user name.  If the requested user name was in the usernames array,
the user was given a warning, and the submit button was
disabled.  Otherwise, the user was able to submit the form to the
server-side registration program, presumably as a first step to
participating in the site.

                +"' was taken!");

                submit_button.disabled = false;
            }

        }

        function checkUsername() {
            // Send the HTTP request
        xhr.open("GET", "usernames.txt", true);
        xhr.onreadystatechange = parseUsernames;
        xhr.send(null);
        }

    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Register&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p id="warning"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Username: &lt;input type="text" name="username"

        &lt;p&gt;Password: &lt;input type="password" name="password" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;E-mail address: &lt;input type="text" name="email_address" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Register" id="submit-button"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre></div><p>
To turn last month's registration page into an Ajax-style one, we
modify the checkUsername function, which is invoked when the user
finishes entering his or her requested user name.  Instead of defining the
usernames array, we instead have checkUsername fire off an
Ajax request to the server.  Unlike last month's non-Ajax version,
this is all that checkUsername will do.  The updated function looks
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
function checkUsername() {
xhr.open("GET", "usernames.txt", true);
xhr.onreadystatechange = parseUsernames;
xhr.send(null);
}
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, our function is requesting the file usernames.txt
from the server.  When xhr's state changes, we ask to invoke the
parseUsernames function.  It is in this function that we have put
the serious logic, first turning the retrieved file contents into an array:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var usernames = [ ];

if (xhr.readyState == 4) {
if (xhr.status == 200) {
    usernames = xhr.responseText.split("\n");
}
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Here, we see the standard Ajax pattern repeated from the previous
example: wait for xhr.readyState to be 4, and then check that
xhr.status (the HTTP response status code) is 200.  At that point, we
know we have received the contents of usernames.txt, which (as
you can see from Listing 2) contains the existing user names, one
user name per line.  We use JavaScript's split function to turn this
into an array, which we assign to usernames.
</p><p>
From this point on, we can reuse the logic from last month's non-Ajax
version, first grabbing the various node IDs from the page, using DOM
methods:

<pre     class="programlisting">
var new_username = document.forms[0].username.value;
var found = false;
var warning = document.getElementById("warning");
var submit_button = document.getElementById("submit-button");
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, we check to see if the requested user name is in our array:

<pre     class="programlisting">

for (i=0 ; i&lt;usernames.length; i++)
{
    if (usernames[i] == new_username)
    {
        found = true;
    }
}

</pre>
</p><p>
If the user name is found in the list, we issue a warning at the top of
the page.  Otherwise, we clear out any warning that might be there:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if (found)
{
    setText(warning, "Warning: username '" + new_username +"' was taken!");
    submit_button.disabled = true;
}

else
{
    removeText(warning);
    submit_button.disabled = false;
}
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, is this a good way to handle the checking of user names? Not
really&mdash;although now that we have the basic Ajax logic in place, we
can modify it slightly to be more efficient and secure.
</p><p>
One problem is that the list of user names is in a static file.
Perhaps our server is running a cron job that creates usernames.txt on
a regular basis, but that seems a bit silly when we can instead use a
server-side program to query the database dynamically.  Switching from
a static file to a dynamic page thus seems like a good idea, if only
for performance reasons.
</p><p>
There are security reasons as well.  As with last month's version, we
are downloading the entire list of user names to the user's browser.
This means that a potentially malicious user would have access to all
of the user names and would be able to poke through them, either with
the intention of trying to break into the site or spam the users.
</p><p>
One potential downside of using Ajax for this type of check is the
speed issue.  As I indicated previously, the core of Ajax is its
asynchronous nature, which means that we cannot know how long it will
take for the server to respond to our query.  In my simple tests, the
round trip from my browser to my server and back was nearly
instantaneous, and it provided me with useful feedback right away.  On a
more heavily loaded server, or with a more sophisticated database
query, or if users have slow Internet connections, asynchronous calls
might begin to feel sluggish.  That said, even the worst Ajax function
will likely be faster than a page refresh, because of the reduced
overhead that is involved.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This month, we finally begin to use Ajax in an application.  We
see here how it is possible to take some existing JavaScript code and
break it apart into two functions: one that invokes the Ajax call
and the other that handles the parsing of data when the call
receives a response.
</p><p>
However, we also see that there are security and efficiency problems
with this approach.  A better technique would be to send only the
requested user name in the Ajax call and get a simple yes or no
answer from the server, indicating whether the user name had been taken
already.  Next month, we will do just that, using an Ajax POST
query instead of our GET query from this month, and replacing
usernames.txt with a server-side program that works in conjunction
with our Ajax call.

Further Reading</b></p><p>
There has been an explosion of books and articles about Ajax
programming in the last year, and I am slowly making my way through
many of them.  Two of the best that I've read are both published by
O'Reilly.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Head Rush Ajax</em></span> is aimed at beginners and teaches the
introductory material in a fun, effective way.  <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ajax Design
Patterns</em></span>, which I mentioned earlier in this article, is probably my
favorite Ajax book so far (despite its design and editing, which
aren't up to the usual O'Reilly standards).  This latter book is a good
introduction to the subject for experienced Web developers.

The Ajaxian.com Web site has a large number of links, tutorials and
articles having to do with Ajax development on a variety of different
platforms.  If you're interested in Ajax development, it's
worth keeping this site in your RSS reader or bookmarks.
