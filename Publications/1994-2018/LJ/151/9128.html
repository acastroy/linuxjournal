This article examines the impact that Linux and open-source software
are having on the telecommunication industry, technology trends moving
toward open and standards-based platforms and the .orgs that are active
in promoting carrier grade base platforms.  Furthermore, this article
focuses on the Carrier Grade Linux initiative at OSDL and discusses its
contributions to this growing ecosystem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x1f763a0"></a>
Introduction</h2></div></div><p>
The telecommunication industry is facing several challenges:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Telecom service providers are looking to reduce their costs using commodity
software and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware building blocks.
</p></li><li><p>
Telecom service providers require seamless integration of COTS carrier grade components; the
integrated solution must be validated for carrier grade availability.
</p></li><li><p>
The growth of packet traffic is putting pressure on communication
networks originally designed for &ldquo;store and forward&rdquo;;
platforms in an all-IP
environment that maintain carrier-class characteristics are delivering
increasing levels of availability and dependability.
</p></li><li><p>
Operators want to decrease time to market and increase the capability for fast
delivery of new services by shortening new service development time and
unifying platforms.
</p></li><li><p>
Of course, operators want to roll out the above capabilities while still
making money and increasing profits.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Linux and open-source software provide a compelling avenue to operator
success.  The open-source operating system has certain characteristics
that confer upon it advantages over other operating systems;
indeed, Linux has been a disruptive technology with clear impact in
telecommunications.  Today, not only do many of the server nodes with
telecom networks run Linux, but Linux also powers mobile phones and many
intermediate nodes &ldquo;in the middle&rdquo;.
</p><p>
So, what is a disruptive technology, and how does it impact an industry?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x1f769d0"></a>
Disruptive Technology</h2></div></div><p>
Disruptive technologies first appear saddled with significant deficiencies
and are usually targeted at niche segments.  Disruptive technologies,
however, also provide significant cost benefits.  For example, a truly
disruptive technology may offer only half the performance of its legacy
competitor but can be delivered at one-tenth the cost.
</p><p>
Disruptive technologies are most often taken up by early adopters and then
experience a much slower adoption into the mainstream.  The adoption of a
disruptive technology always starts with non-mission-critical applications
(such as utility computing) and moves to mission-critical application as
it matures (such as business-critical and enterprise core applications).  Linux adoption
followed this pattern, starting out hosting Web servers, e-mail and
FTP servers and moving now to mission-critical applications, such as
telephony.  With increasing adoption, a disruptive technology, such as
Linux, provides an opportunity (or even forces) companies to re-evaluate
and also re-invent their business models and identify real value-added
products and services.  Companies that do not provide clear value quickly
find themselves out of the market.
</p><p>
Linux adoption in telecommunication has not only been increasing, but
adoption is also accelerating.  Reasons to adopt Linux vary but revolve
around common key advantages, such as licensing terms, full access to
source code, freedom to choose from multiple providers, lower costs versus
legacy and proprietary operating systems, higher system performance,
reliability, security, source code quality, innovation rate, peer review,
testing resources and the availability of an established ecosystem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x1f76b88"></a>
The Telephony Business in (R)Evolution</h2></div></div><p>
The traditional telecommunication business model is one of high-margin
and high-revenue business.  In the past, telecom experienced better
than 10% year-on-year growth, and almost any project could become
successful because demand was so great.  Telecommunication companies
bought in and sold on proprietary solutions, taking a margin on top of
the initial licensing costs.  Standards were sufficient only to ensure
basic connectivity; after that, essentially proprietary models were built up,
with vendor lock-in as the norm.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9128f1.large.jpg"><img src="9128f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Telephony Business in (R)Evolution: the Business State from
the mid-1980s to Today
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 1 illustrates the state of the telecom business beginning in
the mid-1980s up to the present.  In the 1980s, the carrier's business
was monopoly-based with very few players in the field, which provided
carriers the opportunity to make a lot of money, due to significant
margins with voice telephony as a high-priced premium service.  In
the mid-1990s, new players (carriers/operators) entered the business,
increasing the competition.  However, voice telephony was still a premium
service, and although prices were falling, operators still had significant
margins.  Today, the business looks very different.  It is shrinking with
many more players in the space, increased competition and much diminished
profits.  Voice telephony is a commodity.  Furthermore, the industry faces
additional threats, such as VoIP and broadband telephony.  How
can they beat free or close-to-free calling?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x1f76ea0"></a>
Technology Trend</h2></div></div><p>
In the past (circa 1985), communications and data service networks
built on proprietary platforms to meet specific requirements
for availability, reliability, performance and service response
time.  However, communications service providers needed to drive down
costs while maintaining carrier-class platforms with high availability,
scalability, security, reliability, predictable performance and easy
maintenance and upgrade.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9128f2.large.jpg"><img src="9128f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Technology Trend from Closed Proprietary to Open
Standards-Based Platforms
</p></div></div><p>
The current technological trend in this space, illustrated in Figure 2,
is moving away from expensive proprietary and legacy systems consisting
of proprietary technologies and components without a clear separation
of the &ldquo;building blocks&rdquo; into standards-based systems that consist
of interchangeable software and hardware COTS &ldquo;building
blocks&rdquo; that
communicate with each other using standardized interfaces and that are offered by
multiple providers.
</p><p>
Traditionally, communications and data service networks were built on
proprietary platforms that had to meet very specific requirements in
areas such as availability, reliability, performance and service response
time.  Those proprietary systems were composed of highly purposed hardware,
operating system and middleware and often included proprietary technologies
and interfaces.  Such proprietary approaches to system architecture
fostered vendor lock-in, served to limit design flexibility and freedom
and produced platforms that are very expensive to maintain and expand.
</p><p>
Today, those same service providers and carriers are challenged to
drive down costs while still maintaining carrier-class characteristics
for platforms to provide service and mission-critical applications in
an all-IP environment.  Providers are in a position today where they
must move away from specialized proprietary architectures and toward
COTS approaches and building practices
(Figure 2) for several reasons:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Faster time to market.
</p></li><li><p>
Reduced design and operation costs by using COTS
hardware and software components.
</p></li><li><p>
The growth of packet traffic is placing added pressure on communication
networks.  Communication platforms reside on all-IP networks and need
to maintain carrier grade characteristics in terms of availability,
reliability, security and service response time.
</p></li><li><p>
The emergence of COTS hardware and software components is driving the
need for seamless integration of all components as integrated solutions
that must be validated for carrier grade availability and scalability.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
The benefits of a standardized platform (Figure 3) based on COTS hardware
and software are many:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Avoiding lock-in: by separating the hardware, operating system, middleware,
applications and integration, vendor lock-in can be avoided by making
components replaceable and interoperable through standardized interfaces.
</p></li><li><p>
The platform achieves economic as well as technical scaling.
</p></li><li><p>
All components and ecosystem links, including the integrator, can be
changed if they underperform, with minimal impact.
</p></li><li><p>
A fully open-source route is possible for next-generation networks
and products.
</p></li><li><p>
End customers benefit from multiple products running side by side on
the platform and from an improved cost base and speed from fewer adopted
platforms.
</p></li><li><p>
Moving to CGL from a proprietary OS can save telecom equipment
manufacturers money because they don't have to develop, maintain or
license an in-house proprietary OS.  Instead, they can invest in the CGL
ecosystem to make Linux good for their own use.  In addition, the
flexibility of an open-source operating system provides for more
customization, increasing each manufacturer's competitive advantage.
</p></li></ol></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9128f3.large.jpg"><img src="9128f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. A Typical Telecom Rack with Multiple Network Elements
</p></div></div><p>
To summarize, the telecommunication industry is transitioning to COTS
architectures and practices, embracing Linux and open-source software
and re-aligning at multiple levels.  Before 1999/2000, the industry
experienced incompatible platforms, protocols, high barriers to entry,
circuit switches and so on.  Today, the telecommunication industry is resurging
with COTS, Linux and open-source software, with many new players and
many opportunities for new businesses.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x236ff60"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Vendor Lock-in</b></p><p>
Lock-in is an economic issue, not a technical one.  It presents a
technology &ldquo;exit barrier&rdquo; and takes four steps.  First,
vendors'
offers initially vary&mdash;with low cost but proprietary solutions,
well-integrated by having just enough standard interfaces and APIs
(proprietary is often called &ldquo;value added&rdquo; or something similar).  Next, vendors offer
business-case compelling information, based around the presumed low cost
of their solution.  The third step is encouraging a strong roll-out of
the solution to establish a sufficiently large installed base to start
raising costs (license, support and so forth).  The fourth and final step is
when suppliers raise pricing up to, but not beyond, the point where
additional roll-out of their equipment is slightly less expensive than
replacing everything with an alternative vendor's.  The exit barrier
has been raised, and you are now locked in.

The .org Players</h2></div></div><p>
There are five major .orgs (Figure 4) active in the space of accelerating
the adoption of carrier grade platforms that are based on COTS hardware
and software.  These organizations are CP-TA, OSDL, PICMG, SA Forum and
the SCOPE Alliance.  In the following sections, we present each of these
organizations, discuss their goals and highlight their contributions.

CP-TA</h2></div></div><p>
The Communications Platforms Trade Association (CP-TA) is a group
of communications platform and building block providers dedicated to
accelerating the adoption of SIG-governed, open specification-based
communications platforms through interoperability testing and
certification.  With industry collaboration, CP-TA plans to drive a
mainstream market for open industry standards-based communications
platforms.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x23705e8"></a>
SA Forum</h2></div></div><p>
The Service Availability Forum (SA Forum) is a consortium of
communications and computing companies working together to develop
and publish high-availability and management software interface
specifications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x23706f0"></a>
OSDL CGL</h2></div></div><p>
The OSDL Carrier Grade Linux (CGL) initiative is an industry forum
that supports and accelerates the development of Linux functionality
for telecommunication applications.  The goal of CGL is to make Linux
better for the telecommunication industry.  A Linux kernel with carrier
grade characteristics is an essential component in open, standards-based
communication platforms and architectures.  OSDL specifically focuses
its work on the Linux operating system and collaborates with other
industry organizations to drive adoption of open standards and
open-source software.  It works closely with each group to ensure that efforts are
complementary and deliver value to the market.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x23707f8"></a>
SCOPE Alliance</h2></div></div><p>
The SCOPE Alliance is an industry alliance committed to accelerating
the deployment of carrier grade base platforms for service provider
applications.  Its mission is to help, enable and promote the availability
of open carrier grade platforms based on (COTS) hardware and software
and Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) building blocks and to promote
interoperability to better serve service providers and consumers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x2370900"></a>
PICMG</h2></div></div><p>
The PCI Industrial Computer Manufacturers Group (PICMG) is a consortium
of more than 450 companies who collaboratively develop open specifications
for high-performance telecommunications and industrial computing
applications.  The consortium has resulted in a series of specifications
that include CompactPCI, AdvancedTCA, AdvancedMC, CompactPCI Express,
COM Express and SHB Express.  The goal of PICMG is to offer equipment
vendors common specifications, thereby increasing availability and
reducing costs and time to market.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x2370a08"></a>
Carrier Grade Linux Initiative at OSDL</h2></div></div><p>
The OSDL Carrier Grade Linux working group was established in January
2002.  Its goal is to identify requirements for enhancing the Linux
operating system to achieve an open-source platform that is highly
available, reliable, secure and scalable, and suitable for carrier grade
systems.  The CGL working group has the vision that next-generation and
multimedia communication services can be delivered using Linux-based
platforms.  To realize this vision, the work group developed a strategy
to define the requirements and architecture for the Carrier Grade Linux
platform and promote development of a stable platform for deployment
of commercial components and services.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9128f5.large.jpg"><img src="9128f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Scope of the Carrier Grade Linux Working Group
</p></div></div><p>
The CGL working group focuses on two areas: carrier grade enhancements
to the operating system that are related to various requirements, such
as availability and scalability, and software development tools.  Today,
more than two-dozen OSDL member companies from all over the globe are
actively involved with the CGL initiative.  Member companies cover the
whole ecosystem: carriers, network equipment providers (NEPs), telecom
equipment manufacturers (TEMs), platform providers, independent software
vendors (ISVs), middleware providers and Linux distributors.
</p><p>
The CGL working group also identifies existing open-source
projects that map to the CGL requirements.  The result
is the CGL Development Guideline Web site (see the on-line Resources).
This is an effort from the CGL initiative to survey open source for
projects that can potentially provide implementations for the requirements
defined in the CGL Requirements Documents.  This site is maintained and
updated frequently.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9128f6.large.jpg"><img src="9128f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Overview of the CGL Initiative from Its Inception in 2002 to June
2006
</p></div></div><p>
The CGL working group collects requirements from multiple industry
sources and develops use cases for the various proposed capabilities
and functionalities.  The working group then sorts and prioritizes the
input from the industry, member companies and end users to identify
open-source projects that are working on these areas.  If no open-source
project exists, the working group starts new open-source projects to
develop these capabilities and focuses its resources to develop solutions
with high potential for mainstream acceptance.  In many instances, member
companies have (re)released previously proprietary technologies as open
source to accelerate the availability of these capabilities in Linux.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9128f7.large.jpg"><img src="9128f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. The CGL Initiative Work Process
</p></div></div><p>
The CGL initiative released the original CGL Requirement Definition
Document in 2002 (v1.1) and has issued two revisions (v2.0 and v3.2),
and it also has established a registration process for Linux vendors to register
compliance of their Linux distributions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x2371198"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
CGL and the COTS Ecosystem</b></p><p>
CGL is an important part of the telecommunications move to using
COTS components for building equipment.
Carriers and service providers are in a position today where they
must move away from specialized proprietary architectures toward
COTS approaches and building practices for several reasons, such as
reducing design and operation costs and gaining the ability to deliver new
services faster based on common standardized platforms.  In addition,
the increased power and reliability of such building blocks, along
with the development of specifications that guide their
implementation, are allowing more flexibility for network deployment
with improved price performance.  CGL is a core building block, providing
a Linux kernel that offers the needed reliability, availability and
performance for platforms running in mission-critical environments
and providing communication services.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e7e580.0x23713a8"></a>
Debian, the Latest Compliant Distribution to CGL</h2></div></div><p>
The CGL working group established a registration process for Linux
distributions to disclose information on how they meet the CGL
requirements.  The process is a public disclosure of all CGL requirements
as mandated by each CGL release version and describes how the Linux vendor
met the CGL requirements.  The outcome of the registration process allows
CGL-registered platform suppliers to market their Linux distributions
and systems to NEPs and TEMs and carriers with the CGL registration mark
to demonstrate the platform's suitability for carrier grade applications.
</p><p>
In June 2006, Debian passed the CGL 2.0 registration process, becoming
the seventh distribution that meets the CGL 2.0 requirements.  The other six
are Asianux, FSMLabs, MontaVista, Novell, TimeSys and Wind River.  The
Debian announcement is of great importance.  Debian is one of the leading
distributions of the Linux operating system.  Its registration adds more
than 1,000 developers and tens of thousands of end users to the CGL
community.  Debian registration gives telecommunications providers a fully
open platform that comes with the support of one of the strongest Linux
communities and represents an ideal balance between
&ldquo;roll-your-own&rdquo; CGL
solutions and available commercial options.  Telecommunications equipment
providers looking for a fully open option now have one.

Closing</h2></div></div><p>
In the February 2006 <span   class="emphasis"><em>LinuxWorld</em></span> magazine editorial,
&ldquo;The Holy Grail
of Networking&rdquo;, Stuart Cohen, CEO of OSDL, discussed the end-to-end
infrastructure with a single operating system (Linux) and the role OSDL
is playing to enable this single OS infrastructure from the server to
the handset.  At OSDL, the CGL and MLI initiatives are driving forward an
&ldquo;end-to-end&rdquo; Linux deployment, succeeding in its mission to accelerate
the development and adoption of Linux from the enterprise to mobile
computing in a vertical industry that has been historically dominated
by proprietary technologies.  What's next for Linux? Only time will tell.
