It takes creative thinking, focus, and most of all, plenty of lead time to
create a successful free software event.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc87580.0xd7f3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;What are you working on?&rdquo;, I asked Dennis, a young
friend of mine from Florianopolis.  &ldquo;I am working on the design of a
T-shirt for the conference we are developing, but I do not have any good
ideas for the design&rdquo;, he said.  &ldquo;What is the purpose of the
conference?&rdquo;, I asked.  &ldquo;Who is the target market?&rdquo;
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;, he asked suspiciously, probably thinking
that this was going to turn into a lecture on marketing.  He was right.
</p><p>
Many Linux User Groups (LUGs) have tried to put on small, local events
to introduce people to Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS).  Some have
been successful, and some have failed.  Some have even been &ldquo;too
successful&rdquo;, over time burning out the volunteer staff that put
the conference together.  But, the successful ones always have tended to follow a
similar pattern&mdash;that of thorough planning.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Defining your purpose and who you are going to be reaching is very
important&rdquo;, I said, and continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
For example, do you want the conference
to be technically oriented, to satisfy programmers or systems
administrators, or do you want it to be more business-oriented, to
convince business people that they should be using free software? Is
your aim to show people how they can create jobs or make money with free
software? You can do all of this with one event, but it would be
a larger event and much more difficult to do than to concentrate on just
one audience.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Dennis thought about this for a while, and said, &ldquo;I want it to be
technical, but invite a few business people.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And when do you want to have this conference?&rdquo;, I asked.
&ldquo;In two months&rdquo;, he said.
</p><p>
One of the biggest mistakes a group makes in planning an event is
trying to have it too soon.  Often I get an invitation to speak at an event
three months away.  I tell the people that I would have been willing to
attend, but that the date has been booked for six months.  Many venues
big enough to hold even a small conference are often booked six to nine
months in advance.  To have the most leeway, you probably should start
planning a year in advance.  It will not be constant planning during
that year, but the bigger items (venue, keynote speakers and so forth) should
take precedence early in the planning process.
</p><p>
&ldquo;What is the theme of your event?&rdquo;, I asked.  &ldquo;Free
Software&rdquo; came the reply.
</p><p>
In the past, &ldquo;Free Software&rdquo; meant &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;
or &ldquo;BSD&rdquo; or some of the GNU tools, but today, &ldquo;Free
Software&rdquo; means audio/video tools, customer relationship management
software, Voice over IP, content management systems, TV capture and
playback, development tools, many types of database programs, clustering
software and much, much more.  Trying to cover such a wide range of
interests is difficult in a small conference.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Why not focus on just 'audio/video'&rdquo;, I suggested.
&ldquo;You could even invite Gilberto Gil [Brazil's most famous rock
star, and the Minister of Culture under President Lula] to speak.&rdquo;
This went over well with the rest of the planning committee, who was now
beginning to gather around the T-shirt table.
</p><p>
Dennis had taken steps to avoid the second big mistake that a lot of
groups make&mdash;a planning committee that is too small.  &ldquo;Many
hands lessens the load&rdquo;, and in a lot of ways make planning the
event much more fun.  By enlisting a set of enthusiastic friends, Dennis
had committees for each of the major functions that they needed.  A quick
status recount found that any suitable venue was only available nine
months in the future.  The &ldquo;two-month wonder conference&rdquo;
would have to be rescheduled for later, which was greeted with a sigh
of relief from the program committee of Chico, Douglas and Felipe.
</p><p>
&ldquo;We have been having trouble finding speakers&rdquo;, they wailed.
&ldquo;Even with the new dates, we do not know who to ask.&rdquo; I
suggested that with the new dates and the new theme of
&ldquo;audio/video&rdquo; that
they might approach the developers of some of the projects to see if they
would be willing to come.  If, however, their target audience is users
rather than developers, they would be better off getting local people to
learn the projects, and then do a presentation on how they work and how to use
them rather than how to develop them.  Other good topics, particularly for
those new to Free Software, are the general topics of how Free Software
works, the different software licensing models and how to turn in a good
bug report.  Using local people to do a lot of the presentations keeps
down the costs of hotel rooms, airline fares and translators (if speakers do
not speak your language), and it also gives local people a chance to
develop speaking skills&mdash;useful the next time you put on a
conference.
</p><p>
&ldquo;But without big-name speakers, how do we attract sponsors?
We do not want to charge any money for our event&rdquo;, said Rodolfo,
the treasurer.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Although I appreciate that you want everyone to come to the event
'for free', there are times when you need to charge a little bit to cover
costs&rdquo;, I said, and added:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Why not ask for R$5 (five Reals) as a donation? You may be
surprised how much money you get if people have a good time and learn a
lot.  Sponsorships also can come in the form of Internet connectivity,
equipment loans, advertising and other trades, which are easier to
get than money.  Also, local events can attract donations and vendor
sales from local vendors.  A local bookstore, for instance, can stock
up on Free Software books if they are given enough warning and a list
of books people might want to buy.  And remember, that although many
people think of large companies when they think of sponsorships,
small companies also can contribute smaller sums of money that can go
a long way toward paying the costs of a great conference.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
&ldquo;I went to a conference that was free, but they sold a T-shirt and
a CD-ROM of the conference proceedings for a 'donation' of R$10&rdquo;, said
Andr&eacute; &ldquo;It could not have cost them more than R$5 to make both,
so each person contributed R$5 to the conference.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;And, raffles of donated products as prizes is also a way to make
money.  I remember a conference that made 3,000 Australian dollars off
raffled prizes that were donated by vendors&rdquo;, I said, and
continued:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The
main thing, however, is to try to keep the costs down.  Because most
conferences are educational, a lot of times you can get the local college
or university to donate the space, with the cost of custodial and security
personnel as the only charge.  These days, a lot of such institutions
are happy to help you plan a Free Software event.  They see it as good
for their students and faculty and also for their image with potential
students if done well.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
&ldquo;What about food?&rdquo;, asked Henry.  &ldquo;You need food for
people to eat.&rdquo; &ldquo;A picnic basket or a brown-bag lunch is
fine&rdquo;, I said, adding:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
A cooler of sodas and bottled water sold at
a reasonable price, and you will have a lot of happy people.  Make sure
you have trash cans around for the wrappings, and recycle the cans and
bottles.  One of the best conferences I have attended sold a simple loaf
of French bread with a little spread on it for one Euro, and a bottle of
drink for another Euro.  It was enough for lunch, and fast to eat.  And,
of course, you'll need coffee.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
   &ldquo;Hotel rooms&rdquo;, said Andr&eacute; &ldquo;we will need them.  How
do we handle the hotel rooms?&rdquo; I answered:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
For a one-day event, with
local attendees, not too many hotel rooms will be needed.  Most people
can make their own reservations simply by having a list of reasonably
priced hotels local to the event.  For guest speakers, you may want to
make the hotel reservations for them to help keep costs under control,
but many guest speakers in the Free Software world are happy to stay
in a host's house, or a university dorm room, or some other such place that
is clean and quiet with high-speed Internet available.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
   Andr&eacute; smiled, because I had just described his home where I had stayed
during a Software Livre conference.
</p><p>
&ldquo;What about the business people?&rdquo;, asked Dennis.  I agreed
that the business people needed a slightly different approach, but that
we should talk about that tomorrow, as it was getting late, and the
T-shirt design was still not finished.  &ldquo;What about a Tux riding a
surfboard?&rdquo;, I asked, &ldquo;or maybe in a beach chair with a
chimarrao in its flipper?&rdquo; The rest of the conference committee
crowded around while we sketched examples.
</p><p>
Aside: one of my favorite times of the year is &ldquo;OpenBeach&rdquo;.
This is a small get-together that is usually created for a group of
Free Software people to discuss things that are happening, but also to
enjoy each other's company and meet the families (spouses, children
and so on) of the people they may deal with only by e-mail and chat on a
day-to-day basis.  It is an event by the seaside, with wireless Internet
abounding.  This year, it is preceded by an event at the Universidade
Federal de Santa Catarina on December 6th, 7th and 8th, with a
natural follow-over to OpenBeach.  The combination of the conference and
the relaxing weekend following it will be fun&mdash;and when putting
together an event, <span   class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span> is one of the most important things.
