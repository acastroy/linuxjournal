If you want an agent to monitor and control services, you'll need to get
SMART.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf7f298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There are a lot of excellent monitoring tools (Big Brother, Nagios and so
on), and
some of them allow recovery from dead services, but with great
complexity in their configuration, which becomes even more complicated
when you want to supervise local services that are not remotely accessible,
such as syslog, xinet, mrtg, iptables or Nagios itself.
</p><p>
The purpose with SMART was to have a simple, flexible and quick-to-implement
application for monitoring the most critical system d&aelig;mons
that made it possible to add new ones without modifying the code and to avoid installation
and configuration complexities.  It also needed to be capable of making decisions and
solving problems (or at least trying to do that).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf7f3f8"></a>
Evolution</h2></div></div><p>
After a first version of &ldquo;passive&rdquo; monitoring, we tried to
go a step
further and obtain an &ldquo;active&rdquo; application, that is to say, to add the
possibility of auto-recovery.  By executing the application periodically
through crond, it should detect d&aelig;mons that were down and boot them
without the intervention of the system administrator.
</p><p>
Later, we considered the possibility that a nonprivileged user
could execute this application from a console or remotely (via Telnet or
SSH).  Centralization of detection and error recovery in only one script
made integration with sudo easier.  Furthermore, it allowed delegating
some stronger recovery actions needed in critical situations, such as
rebooting the whole system, to this nonroot-privileged user.
</p><p>
With the ps command, we can list all the active processes in the system,
but being &ldquo;active&rdquo; is not the same as being
&ldquo;operative&rdquo;, so this led us
to include the check scripts, which are small programs to test services
and determine whether they really are operative and answering requests.  The
difficulties we found suggested that we not waste efforts
re-inventing the wheel and profit from plugins included in Nagios
(monitoring software that we were using satisfactorily for almost three
years).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf7f710"></a>
Files and Directories</h2></div></div><p>
The distribution of SMART has two shell scripts (smart and
check-service), two configuration files (host.conf and services.conf)
and two directories (scripts and plugins), which contain the check scripts
and the plugins (Listing 1).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf7f818"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. The SMART Installation Files and Directories</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

</pre></div><p>
Permissions of files and directories allow a nonprivileged user called
sysman to execute the application, but deny sysman the ability to modify
the contents to use it in an inadequate way.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf7fa80"></a>
General Operation</h2></div></div><p>
The SMART program reads the configuration files services.conf and
host.conf and executes check-service for each defined service.  If a check
script has been assigned to a service, for example, services 1 and 2 in
Figure 1, check-service will execute it, passing the needed parameters
and then will wait for the exit status to determine whether the service is
alive.  If this check script executes some other external script (plugin),
such as service 1 in Figure 1, this one will be responsible for checking
the service status.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9132f1.large.jpg"><img src="9132f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. SMART Program
</p></div></div><p>
If no check script has been assigned to a service (service 3 in Figure
1), the check-service file will determine the service status by getting
the number of active processes.  According to this information, the SMART
command-line parameters and the configuration parameters, it will decide
what actions to carry out.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf7fd98"></a>
Integration with sudo</h2></div></div><p>
Integration with the sudo (superuser do) tool allows the system
administrator to permit another user (sysman) to start dead services,
restart all the services or reboot the whole system.  Advantages of this are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Simple configuration: there's no need to give privileges to that user to
stop and start every service, and no need to use administrative tools (ps,
kill, rm and so on).  The check-service script centralizes the whole operation.
</p></li><li><p>
Security: user sysman can't read, write or execute the
check-service file.
</p></li><li><p>
Easy to use: scripts are managed by sudo, so its usage will
be transparent for the user.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
For a user sysman, who needs privileges on the host server, the
configuration file of sudo (/etc/sudoers) should be as shown in Listing 2.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf80160"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 2. sudo Configured for SMART Access</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
# Defaults specification
Defaults:root !syslog

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL) ALL
sysman  server=(root) NOPASSWD: /home/sysman/check-service
sysman  server=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
</pre></div><p>
This way, we disable syslog logging when sudo is executed by user root,
and we assign root privileges to user sysman, at the host server, only
for the execution of commands /home/sysman/check-service and
/sbin/reboot, without asking sysman for the password every time.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf803c8"></a>
Verifications</h2></div></div><p>
Through the PID file defined in the configuration file, we obtain the
parent process identifier (PID), and we determine the number of active
processes generated by this service.  Next we check whether:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The service is responding to petitions within the defined time period.
</p></li><li><p>
The number of processes generated by the service doesn't exceed the maximum
and minimum defined thresholds.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf80688"></a>
Status Determination</h2></div></div><p>
Considering the results obtained in former verifications, we classify
the service status:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
0: service is responding to requests within the defined time period,
the number of processes generated by service remains between the defined
thresholds, and the information provided by the PID file is correct.
</p></li><li><p>
1: service is responding to requests within the defined time period
and the number of processes generated by service remains between the
defined thresholds, but either the information provided by the PID file is
incorrect or this file doesn't exist, even though it has been defined.
</p></li><li><p>
2: service is responding to requests within the defined time period, but
the number of processes generated by the service is beyond the defined thresholds
(this could be the case of an overloaded but operative Web server).
</p></li><li><p>
3: the number of generated processes is out of thresholds, and we don't
have any tool (script) to check whether the service is operative
(this could be the case of processes such as syslogd, crond and xinetd).
</p></li><li><p>
4: service is not responding to requests within the defined time period.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
We group the above five situations in three more general cases:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
OK (status 0 and 1).
</p></li><li><p>
WARN (status 2).
</p></li><li><p>
DOWN (status 3 and 4).
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf776a8"></a>
Decision</h2></div></div><p>
When executing the program with no parameters, it simply will determine
the status of services defined in the configuration file and will display
the results.  If we want the program to work in an active way, we need
to use some of the following parameters:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
-w: restart services in WARN status and send a notification (e-mail)
for each one of them.
</p></li><li><p>
-d: restart services in DOWN status and send a notification for each
one of them.
</p></li><li><p>
-wd: restart services in WARN and DOWN status and send a notification
for each one of them.
</p></li><li><p>
--all: restart all services independently of their status and send a
notification for each service with WARN or DOWN status.
</p></li><li><p>
--reboot: restart the whole system independently of service's status and
send a general notification.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once the service status has been determined, and according to the
parameter specified in the execution, the action carried out for each
service will consist of that shown in Table 1.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf77bd0"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. Service Actions</b></p><table     summary="Table 1. Service Actions9132t1.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>

Furthermore, independently of the service's status, with the parameters --all
and --reboot, a notification via e-mail is sent to the administrator
about the performed action.
</p><p>
Listing 3 shows a sample of SMART in action, executed from a console with
parameter -d (recovery of services in DOWN status).

Check Scripts</h2></div></div><p>
There are some optional executables files, the check scripts,
responsible for checking whether the monitored services really
are operative and responding to petitions.  These files are written in Shell
(.sh extension) and Expect (.exp extension). Expect is a tool
that requires Tcl and allows for automation of interactive applications
that use textual representation.
</p><p>
These scripts could be written in any programming language, because
only the exit status is taken into account.  If it's not equal to 0,
we suppose that there has been no answer or that the answer given by the
service has not been the expected one.  This means that a check script not
only can monitor services, but it also can achieve any check that returns a
Boolean value, for example, to check whether the size of a directory
exceeds a certain value, whether the amount of logged users is greater than a desired
number, whether a kernel module is loaded and so on (Listing 4).

</pre></div><p>
Files with the .nag extension are also Shell scripts, but unlike the former
ones, they call an external program (plugin) passing to it the parameters
received from check-service, following the order and format that the plugin
expects.  This checks the service and returns the information
gathered to the check script, which will interpret and convert it into
the exit status that check-service is waiting for (Listing 5).

Plugins are programmed in C, Perl and Shell and belong to Nagios.  Their

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0xf79070"></a>
Installation, Configuration and Usage</h2></div></div><p>
Software requirements include the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
sudo: allows a user to execute a command as another user.  This
will be necessary if you are planning to allow a nonroot user to
execute SMART.
</p></li><li><p>
awk: a pattern scanning and processing language.  SMART uses it and
expects to find it at /bin/awk.  If that's not your case, edit
the check-service and smart files of the SMART distribution and modify the line
where AWK=&ldquo;/bin/awk&rdquo; is specified.
</p></li><li><p>
Nagios plugins: sources can be downloaded independently of
the Nagios distribution, and some of them require the additional installation of
certain programs and libraries.  You can use the plugins distributed with
SMART or download the newest ones.
</p></li><li><p>
Some shell scripts (in the scripts directory of SMART) may require
some specific commands to check some services, such as dig for dns, wget
for Web services, nmblookup for nmbd (Samba), ntpq for NTP, ldapsearch
for OpenLDAP and so on.  The paths of these commands are defined in a variable
at the beginning of each script, so you can change their location,
use any other command that might work better for your system or even
rewrite the whole script at your convenience.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
With sudo you can permit another user to run SMART.  If you're not
interested in creating such a user, you can omit steps 1, 2 and 3 below.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Create user sysman and group sysman.
</p></li><li><p>
Create the SMART directory.  It's a good idea to install it at sysman home
and to set the appropriate owner and permissions:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /home/sysman
chown root:sysman /home/sysman
chmod 750 /home/sysman
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Edit the sudo configuration file /etc/sudoers, and add the following lines:

<pre     class="programlisting">
...
sysman  hostname=(root) NOPASSWD: /home/sysman/check-service
sysman  hostname=(root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Download the SMART software.
</p></li><li><p>
Untar and unzip the distribution:

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -zxf smart-X.Y.tar.gz
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Go to the distribution directory and copy the files to the destination directory.  If
you choose a destination different from /home/sysman, you will have to
edit the smart file and modify the line where dir=&ldquo;/home/sysman&rdquo; is
specified:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd smart-X.
cp check-service /home/sysman/
cp smart /home/sysman/
cp host.conf.dist /home/sysman/host.conf
cp services.conf.dist /home/sysman/services.conf
cp -r scripts /home/sysman/
cp -r plugins /home/sysman/
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
Go to the destination directory, and check/set file permissions and
owners:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /home/sysman
chown -R root:root check-service scripts plugins host.conf services.conf
chown root:sysman smart
chmod -R 700 check-service scripts plugins
chmod 750 smart
chmod 644 host.conf services.conf
</pre>
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Configuration is as follows.  First, edit the SMART host configuration file
host.conf, and modify it according to your preferences (hostname, mail
addresses, commands paths and so on).  Then, edit the SMART services configuration
file services.conf, and uncomment/modify/add any service/d&aelig;mon you
want to check.  Every line describes one service, with the following
semicolon-separated parameters:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
NAME (non-empty string): descriptive service name (for example, IMAP).
</p></li><li><p>
process_name[:port] (non-empty string[:integer]): parent process name
and its operational port (for example, couriertcpd:143).
</p></li><li><p>
process_param (string): parameters of running process.  Some services
run with the same process name, so parameters are useful to distinguish
them.  For example, the parent process of Courier IMAP and POP3 is couriertcpd,
but one is executed with the parameter pop3d and the other one with
imapd.
</p></li><li><p>
max_procs (non-empty integer): the highest number of running processes allowed
(for example, 10).  Leave it at 0 if what you're monitoring runs no processes
(for example, disk space).
</p></li><li><p>
min_procs (non-empty integer): the lowest number of running processes allowed
(for example, 1).  Leave it at 0 if what you're monitoring runs no processes
(for example, disk space).
</p></li><li><p>
start_command (string): the command to start the service or script to be
executed when the service is down (for example, /courier/libexec/imapd.rc).
</p></li><li><p>
pid_file (string): pid file path (for example, /var/run/imapd.pid).
</p></li><li><p>
sock_file (string): socket file path.
</p></li><li><p>
start_mode (0/1): the service can be started/stopped by adding start/stop
to the start command (1), or it may not be necessary (0).
</p></li><li><p>
check_script (string): the name of the script used to check the service.  This
script has to be in the scripts directory (for example, imap.nag).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Leave the parameters empty if they are not applicable, except NAME,
process_name, max_procs, min_procs and start_mode, which can't be empty.
</p><p>
Now, you should be able to run SMART as user root or sysman:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/home/sysman/smart
</pre>
</p><p>
Try using -h to get more information about available parameters.  Running
SMART through crond might be a good thing.  You can run it as frequently as
you want, but doing it every five minutes seems to be reasonable enough.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe87580.0x15093f8"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
SMART is an easy-to-install application (simply copying the
program), is much simpler to configure than Nagios (adding a new element
to monitor involves adding only one line in the configuration file), and
SMART is
flexible, allowing you to monitor any service or aspect of the system,
and it is very effective.

Our experience in a production environment with thousands of users
tells us that it's inevitable that we will reach some peak periods in which the
amount of requests received by a service goes beyond the capabilities
of the system, and response time grows in a dramatic manner.  The fact
that the system detects this situation, before its own administrator,
and solves it in five minutes, is a great problem solver and
provides a perception of better service to users.

After two years of running SMART on about 15 servers, we can say
that its main contribution has been our peace of mind.  It's wonderful
having a colleague who is checking that everything works
correctly 24/7 and who informs you about troubles after they already have been
solved (especially during the weekends).
