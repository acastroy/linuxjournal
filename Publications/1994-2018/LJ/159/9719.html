Convert Video from Color to Black and White</h2></div></div><p>
The versatility of the Linux command line is often underestimated.
Tasks,
such as sophisticated multimedia processing, need not be done with heavy GUIs
that will run only on powerful machines.
</p><p>
The simple Linux command line can do it if you have MPlayer and the companion
program mencoder installed on your machine.
</p><p>
mencoder is an extremely powerful program that can record
analog and digital television, post-process recorded videos, apply
various filters and so on.
More information is available in the on-line man pages and 
HTML documentation that comes bundled with the source.
</p><p>
Here, we are faced with a simple task of converting a color
movie to black and white. This line will do it for you:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$mencoder color-video.avi -o black-white-video.avi 
 &#8618;-vf hue=0:0 -oac copy -ovc lavc
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are interested in trying out various values for hue and
saturation, you can invoke MPlayer with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$mplayer -vf hue color-video.avi
</pre>
</p><p>
Press and hold the 5 or 7 keys to reduce hue or saturation.

Not So Tech Tips</h2></div></div><p>
What follows are some very basic tips. For those who already know this
information, I apologize if this insults your intelligence. However,
I've looked over many a shoulder of very competent Linux users who
still don't seem to know about these standard commands and techniques.
If you're one of them, you may find this information extremely useful.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
cd -</b></span>
</p><p>
Almost everyone knows you can type <tt  >cd ~</tt> to get to the current
user's home directory. This isn't a function of cd, but it takes
advantage of the fact that the tilde is shorthand for your home directory.
The command <tt  >cd -</tt> (dash instead of tilde) is a function of cd, however.
It takes you to the last directory where you were working before you
switched to the current directory. It also prints out the old directory
path. I, myself, have known about this command since the dark ages,
but I still curse myself for forgetting to use it and typing out a long
path name.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
Don't Delete That Service Link</b></span>
</p><p>
Most Linux distributions still use a directory, such as /etc/rc2.d, to
store a number of symbolic links to boot startup files. You probably
know that the order is determined by the number that follows the capital
letter S. For example, S10acpid starts before S11klogd.
</p><p>
I have seen a number of administrators delete these links in order to
disable services temporarily to test something. Then, they grumble when
they have to figure out what startup number it used to have when they
restore the link.
</p><p>
Don't delete the link; simply rename it. For example, rename
S25bluetooth to s25bluetooth. The fact that it starts with a lowercase
s will stop the bluetooth service from starting at the next boot.
When you've determined that you want bluetooth back, simply rename it
back to S25bluetooth. Sure, there are GUI programs to disable and
enable services, but the command-line method is so simple. And remember,
contrary to conventional wisdom, the lazy way to do something is often
the best way.

Install and Boot Many Distributions</h2></div></div><p>
I run lots of Linux distributions. If you do too, here's the way I
install and manage them. If you have a better method, by all means,
send it to <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>, and if we use it,
you will receive $100 for the tip.
</p><p>
Create a single relatively small ext3-formatted boot partition on your
drive that you will use as your master boot partition with GRUB as your
bootloader. My partition is 100MB, and it's probably overkill.
</p><p>
This /boot partition will generally reside on the first drive on
your system, but it doesn't have to. Install your first distribution
with this partition. When everything is working, change the line in
/etc/fstab that mounts the /boot partition to mount the partition as
/mnt/boot instead. Create the mountpoint called /mnt/boot. Mount the
boot partition there. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
umount /boot
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, copy everything from that partition to what is now the local /boot
directory for your distribution:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cp -a /mnt/boot/* /boot
</pre>
</p><p>
At this point, you still should be able to boot the distribution you just
installed, even though the kernel files are relocated. But, that won't
last. You need to change part of your menu.lst to specify that the boot
files now reside on the same partition as the rest of the distribution.
For example, if you started with /boot on /dev/sda1 and / on /dev/sda2,
modify your menu.lst file to use the new partition to find the kernel.
Here's a sample original:

<pre     class="programlisting">
title	Some Linux Distro
root	(hd0,0)
</pre>
</p><p>
In our example, you'd change it to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
title	Some Linux Distro
root	(hd0,1)
</pre>
</p><p>
This next part is a little tricky, and there are several ways to approach
it. For example, you simply could make a copy of your grub/menu.lst
file. However, I make a copy of the entire grub directory, because there
are a variety of ways you can accidentally run into problems otherwise.
Here's what I do next:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /mnt/boot
cp -a grub grub.original
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, install your next distribution of Linux in a new partition,
but specify the same /boot partition you used to install the first
distribution. Boot into the new distribution. Repeat the copy process
above.
</p><p>
First, edit the /etc/fstab file to change the entry that mounts /boot
to mount it as /mnt/boot. Then, do this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
umount /boot
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
cp -a /mnt/boot/* /boot
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, edit /mnt/boot/grub.original/menu.lst to include the boot commands
for the new distribution. You can find the boot commands for the new
distribution in /mnt/boot/grub/menu.lst. Don't forget to fix the root
location again too. Assume that your second distribution is on /dev/sdb1
(the first partition of the second drive). In our example, you would change this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
title	Second Linux Distro
root	(hd0,0)
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1141580.0x123a210"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
title	Second Linux Distro
root	(hd1,0)
</pre>
</p><p>
Copy the original grub (with the modified menu.lst that adds the new
distribution) back to the grub directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /mnt/boot
cp -a grub.original/* ./grub
</pre>
</p><p>
This copies not only the updated menu.lst file, but it also restores the
original GRUB binary files. The next time you reboot, you should see a
menu entry for the original distribution plus the one you added.
</p><p>
To add more distributions, create new partitions, rinse, repeat. 
</p><p>
You occasionally may find that you need to reset GRUB after you install
a new distribution. Given our sample partitions above, simply do this
as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grub
&gt; root (hd0,0)
&gt; setup (hd0)
</pre>
</p><p>
One last tip: don't forget that when you upgrade a distribution
such that it installs a new kernel, you'll have to view the new
/boot/grub/menu.lst file for that distribution and use it as the guide
to modify /mnt/boot/grub/menu.lst to use the updated kernel.
