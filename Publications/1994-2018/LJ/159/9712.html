If you want the power of Rails with Python instead, give Django a jingle.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ccb580.0x1dc33a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When I first began developing Web applications, I did most of my work
in Perl, and my programs were invoked via CGI. My preferences have
shifted somewhat over the years, first toward component- and
template-based systems, such as Mason and Zope, and then toward all-encompassing
frameworks, such as OpenACS. Most recently, I've been spending time
using Ruby on Rails. As a longtime Perl programmer, I've been
pleasantly surprised by both the Ruby language and the Rails
framework.
</p><p>
But, of course, Ruby isn't the only popular language out there, and
Rails isn't the only popular framework. One of the biggest rivals to
Rails during the last year or two has been Django, a Python-based
framework with many of the same goals as Rails. Django was first
written by Adrian Holovaty while working for a newspaper in Lawrence,
Kansas. Holovaty now works for the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Washington Post</em></span>,
but he continues to
work on the framework along with a host of other open-source
contributors.
</p><p>
It would be misleading to say that Django is a Python port of
Rails (or vice versa). But, there are many similarities between the
two projects. Both Rails and Django grew out of successful commercial
projects, the former at 37 Signals and the latter at a newspaper.
Both aspire to make Web development fun and easy, removing as much of
the drudgery as possible from such work. Both use the
model-view-controller (MVC) paradigm for handling actions and creating
pages. Both use a particular programming language throughout the
system for code and configuration files. And, both have managed to
rally a large following, ensuring that they both will continue to be
developed for some time to come.
</p><p>
This month, then, I begin a trip into the world of Django to see
exactly what it is about this framework that excites people. Even
if you're never going to create anything in Django, or you dislike the
Python language, I expect there will be something that Django can
teach you, or at least make you think about.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ccb580.0x1dc3710"></a>
Installing Django</h2></div></div><p>
The main Web server for Django is at <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com" target="_self">www.djangoproject.com</a>,
and you can download a version from there for your own
computer. At the time of this writing, the latest official version is
0.96.
You can download that version in a .tar.gz file, or you can live on
the edge a bit, getting the latest development version via Subversion
(svn). I chose the latter path for this column, although if I were
working on a commercial site, I might well prefer the stable
version.
</p><p>
As is the case with Ruby on Rails, the Django code is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> a skeleton
Web site, so it should not be placed under a directory that is
publicly viewable via the Web. Rather, the code should be installed
like any other set of Python libraries and programs on your server,
using the standard Python install routine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python setup.py install
</pre>
</p><p>
Once this installation is complete, you can use it to create one or
more Django projects. The terminology here can be a bit tricky,
especially if you're coming from the Rails world, so be careful. A
Django project contains one or more applications. Each application
then contains sets of models, views and templates. An application
can be reused across multiple projects&mdash;something like plugins or
engines in Rails. For example, you can imagine a calendar application
that is used by multiple projects and a portal project that uses
several applications (for example, calendar, e-mail and RSS reader) that
come from elsewhere.
</p><p>
This means that when we create our Django project, we aren't yet ready
to display any code to the world. Rather, we need to create a
project and at least one application within that project if we are to
see any dynamic output.
</p><p>
Let's create a site (named mysite in the Django tutorials, so I
use the same convention here):

<pre     class="programlisting">
django-admin.py startproject mysite
</pre>
</p><p>
When I installed Django on my Ubuntu box, it placed the administration
program django-admin.py in /usr/bin. Your system might have it in a
different location, so you might need to modify your PATH to get the
above to work as written.
</p><p>
Starting a project in this way creates a directory named
mysite, containing four Python source files, each with a .py
extension:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A blank __init.py__ file: whenever a directory contains
__init.py__, Python sees the entire directory as a single
package. So long as the file exists, even if it's blank,
our project will be considered a package.
</p></li><li><p>
settings.py: this file does not contain executable code,
but rather configuration settings for the Django instance.
For example, we soon will modify this file to indicate the
location and type of relational database that we're using.
</p></li><li><p>
urls.py: this is where we will associate URLs to
functionality, using regular expressions to match URLs. If
you're coming from the Rails world, this is similar in
many ways to config/routes.rb.
</p></li><li><p>
manage.py: this is a catchall management program for a
Django site, handling a large number of administrative tasks,
such as starting, stopping and synchronizing the project.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once again, don't make the mysite directory visible to the world via
the Web. Rather, we will expose parts of this directory to the world
through our Django project.
</p><p>
If you're coming from the world of Ruby on Rails, this might seem
like a very small number of files to begin with. (Out of the box,
Rails creates a large number of files and directories.) But, this is
because we haven't really created any applications yet, only the
package (or container, if you will) that will control and use the
application.
</p><p>
The package does have its own HTTP server though, in the same way that
Rails comes with one. We can test that things are in order, at least at the
package level, by starting up that HTTP server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python manage.py runserver
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the first time that we use manage.py, but it is far
from the last. The server, which will be running only on the
localhost address (127.0.0.1), indicates that the basic framework
is up and running and that you now should move ahead with the
database definitions.
</p><p>
On the server side, we get the following messages:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Validating models...
0 errors found.

Django version 0.97-pre, using settings 'mysite.settings'
Development server is running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
</pre>
</p><p>
The first two lines indicate that our models&mdash;the files with which
we describe the contents of our relational database tables&mdash;don't
exist, which means that they generate 0 errors. (Don't worry; we'll
be adding new models, and thus errors, in the near future.) Django
also is nice enough to provide version information to indicate the file
from which settings are being taken and how we can quit the server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ccb580.0x1dc41b8"></a>
Connecting to the Database</h2></div></div><p>
Part of the reason for using a framework like Django is because it
provides us with an excellent object-relational mapper&mdash;a
fancy way of saying that it turns Python objects into database tables
and back without forcing us to work too hard. But, of course, this
is possible only if we connect Django to a database.
</p><p>
For this project, I created a small PostgreSQL database named atf:

<pre     class="programlisting">
createdb -U reuven atf
</pre>
</p><p>
I then can modify settings.py, making the following variable
assignments:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DATABASE_ENGINE = 'postgresql'
DATABASE_NAME = 'atf'
DATABASE_USER = 'reuven'
DATABASE_PASSWORD = ''
DATABASE_HOST = ''
DATABASE_PORT = '5433' 
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that I had to set DATABASE_PORT to 5433 explicitly. On my
system, Django tried to connect to the PostgreSQL server on port 5432,
but the database was listening on port 5433.
</p><p>
Before we run the application, we now should synchronize the database.
This is the Django term for creating tables that have not yet been
defined in the database. We do this by typing (in another shell):

<pre     class="programlisting">
python manage.py syncdb
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, if you're coming from the Rails world, you might be
scratching your head at this point. What tables could Django possibly
need to create? I haven't defined any database tables or model
objects&mdash;what's going on?
</p><p>
The answer is that although Rails and Django are similar in some ways,
they differ significantly in other ways. One of those ways
has to do with authentication. Django assumes that everyone will
want to have an authentication system. After creating the appropriate
database tables, Django then prompts you for the user name, e-mail
address and password of the superuser for your site. It then
finishes with the creation of the administration tables.
</p><p>
Now we can start our server again:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python manage.py runserver
</pre>
</p><p>
If you are running your Django development site on a machine other
than your local workstation, you might want to add an
optional IP address and port number:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python manage.py runserver 10.0.0.1:8000
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ccb580.0x1dc4790"></a>
Creating an Application</h2></div></div><p>
If you point your Web browser at the server you've just set up, you're
bound to be disappointed. Yes, we see that Django is running, but we
also see that it is giving us an error message when we try to access
the server. What's happening?
</p><p>
The simple answer is that we have not yet populated our project with
any applications. The project exists, and the server is running, but
they are basically an empty shell. Until we create and install one or
more applications, we're not going to see very much.
</p><p>
The exception is the Django administrative package, which comes with
the system and is immediately available. Well, that's not quite true.
It's available, but only if you explicitly modify the list of
installed applications (INSTALLED_APPS) to include the appropriate
package name. Luckily, we can do that without too much trouble. We
open up mysite/settings.py, scroll down to the bottom and modify
INSTALLED_APPS such that it includes the string:

<pre     class="programlisting">
"django.contrib.admin"
</pre>
</p><p>
You don't even have to restart the server. Once this value has been
added, you will be asked to log in with a user name and password.
Enter the values that you gave to Django when it created the
administrative database, and you'll get a nicely formatted (if
sparsely populated) administrative site, complete with links to Django
documentation. 
</p><p>
Without any other applications installed, it might seem a bit silly to
have a Django administrative site. But, one of the things Django
provides that Rails doesn't is an underlying authentication and
security system. Right out of the box, Django understands that there
are users and groups, and that they might need to be assigned
different permissions. You easily can add, modify and delete groups,
giving them one or more permissions from a provided list. 
</p><p>
Even without any applications in place, you can create and administer
a system with users, groups and permission levels. It would have
been nice if Django were to support hierarchies of groups, rather than
the one-level model it currently uses. Regardless, I've
always been fond of Web frameworks that come with built-in users,
groups and permissions. The fact that Django comes with a graphical
system to manipulate them is even better.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This month, we began to look at Django, a popular open-source Web
framework written in Python. We got our Django project up and
running, including connections to a relational database. We were even
able to browse through some of its administrative screens, assigning
permissions to users and groups. Next month, we'll continue with our
exploration of Django, looking at how we can create new applications
with its versions of the MVC (model-view-controller) paradigm.
