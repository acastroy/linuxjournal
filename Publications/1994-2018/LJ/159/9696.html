You don't need a fancy photo management application to create a Web-based
image gallery.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x1951298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Digital photography has become so ubiquitous today that even medium-range
mobile phones can capture photographs. Once you
transfer photos to the PC, you need to be able to share them with 
friends and relatives. Most digital cameras produce such high-resolution
images that sending them directly to folks via e-mail is
not always convenient. 
</p><p>
This is when you need an on-line photo-sharing Web site, such as flickr.com,
to help share photographs simply by uploading them. Of course, you
also can do the heavy lifting with tools such as gallery2.
</p><p>
But, in this article, I discuss how to utilize the power of the
Linux command line to create an image gallery.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x1951500"></a>
A Brief Survey of the Graphics Tools in Linux</h2></div></div><p>
All of you have heard of the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). It is
useful for interactive image manipulation, photo retouching
and other editing purposes, but I find it quite difficult to use. There are
often much simpler alternatives that do a much better job for
commonplace image editing. The nice
thing about these alternatives is that you can run them directly from the almighty
command line, which can save time and facilitate easy scripting.
Here are some such tools that interest me:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
qiv: this one is the fastest of the lot. It is lightweight, and it can handle a
huge list of images on the command line. In fact, you can reproduce the
&ldquo;persistence of vision&rdquo; effect of video by dumping the frames
using MPlayer's -vo jpeg or -vo png driver and view them using
<tt  >qiv *</tt>. Pressing
the spacebar gives the same effect of actually watching the
video sans the audio.
</p></li><li><p>
xloadimage: xloadimage, or xli, is another application for viewing images.
</p></li><li><p>
xv: this one is rather outdated now, but it is worth taking a look at it. Some of its
image processing algorithms are cool.
</p></li><li><p>
tgif: tgif, along with dia, xfig and friends, is most useful for creating
technical drawings, block diagrams and the like. I find tgif to be really user-friendly and powerful when it comes to certain common image processing
tasks, such as generating a collage or mosaic of images and annotating
images with text.
</p></li><li><p>
Netpbm suite: this suite has more than 200 command-line utilities and is
used for
advanced image processing purposes that primarily are designed to be
invoked from the Linux command line.
</p></li><li><p>
ImageMagick suite: this suite can be described as the be-all end-all of
image processing.
It has mind-boggling capabilities that can create animations,
logos, convert file formats and, of course, do highly sophisticated image
processing. Go to <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage" target="_self">www.imagemagick.org/Usage</a> for
details on all it can do.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
In this article, I focus primarily on using the ImageMagick toolkit
for the purpose of creating an image gallery.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x1951be0"></a>
A Few Basics</h2></div></div><p>
Obviously, you will want the gallery to be an HTML page for sharing
with friends using the Web.
</p><p>
The first step involves generating thumbnails for all the images. These
have to be linked to the images using HTML tags. But, before that, you need
to take care of the images' varying orientations. Different photographs may
have different dimensions, and you should be able to categorize the
thumbnails based on that. This is no hard and fast rule, but I prefer it
this way.
</p><p>
The next task is to annotate the images with relevant text,
by watermarking either below or above the image. 
ImageMagick has a rich toolchest for achieving this task in an
elegant manner.
</p><p>
You also will want to be able to retrieve, save and
optionally display the EXIF data embedded in the photographs. After
annotating the images, you may want to generate borders, frames
or 3-D reliefs for better visual appeal. Usually, they look nice on Web
pages with a white background.
</p><p>
Another nice-to-have feature is to be able to generate black-and-white photo
equivalents. Of course, in addition to all
this, if users want to download the original, untouched, pristine
photo in full size, they should be able to do so. It might be worthwhile
to provide a download link for all the photos in one single zip file.
</p><p>
For people who don't like clicking on each of the thumbnails, you can
provide a slideshow. But, on Linux, you can do much better. 
You can create a full-fledged video with sound effects. I prefer a
nice MIDI tune, appropriate for the occasion and mood of the snaps. This
has a side benefit of being directly writable to DVD too.
</p><p>
But before this, it's a good idea to create vertical and horizontal
mirror images of each of the photos. That way, the video has a better
flow and visual appeal. It so happens that this is extremely easy to do with
the Linux command line and ImageMagick.
</p><p>
You might have other requirements, such as correcting the exposure,
brightness or contrast, cropping out certain parts of the image or
doing photo retouching with more interesting effects. Again, ImageMagick
can do the trick (as can qiv and other image display tools). To correct
images, you might prefer an interactive tool, such as The GIMP or
tgif.
</p><p>
Other possibilities exist, such as creating a mosaic of images annotated
with nice fonts, but this does not make much sense in an image gallery
application.
</p><p>
Now, let's get down to business.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x1952000"></a>
The Code for the Task</h2></div></div><p>
It is best to use /bin/sh as the programming language. Because all the
work is already done most elegantly and naturally by command-line
utilities, you need only to invoke them with the appropriate switches and
generate simple HTML code a la google.com. 
</p><p>
The first task is to segregate the images into different directories,
depending on the dimensions and orientation of each image.
This is easily done with the following block of code:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

# script to segregate images based on dimensions

for image in *jpg
do
dimension=`identify -format "%wx%h" $image`
# we don't want mkdir shouting at us for 
# directories that exist!
mkdir $dimension 2&gt;/dev/null 
mv $image $dimension
done
</pre>
</p><p>
Now we have all images of identical dimensions, neatly arranged in
separate directories. Let's proceed to generating the thumbnails for
each of them. This script generates the thumbnails:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh

# script to segregate images based on dimensions

# this is where we have all the thumbnails for each of the
# images classified by dimensions above
mkdir thumb
for dir in `ls -F |grep / | grep ^[0-9] `
do
 mkdir thumb/$dir 2&gt;/dev/null
 cd $dir
 width=`echo $dir | cut -dx -f1`
 height=` echo $dir | cut -dx -f2 | cut -d/ -f1 ` 
 for image in *
 do
   convert -size ${width}x${height} $image  -resize 20% \
	   ../thumb/${dir}thumb-$image
 done
 cd ..
done
</pre>
</p><p>
With ImageMagick, you have several nice features available for
decorating thumbnails, and they look impressive. 
</p><p>
1) Thumbnail with thickness and shadow:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ convert rose.jpg -matte \
    \( +clone -fx DarkSlateGrey -repage +0+1 \) \
    \( +clone -repage +1+2 \) \
    \( +clone -repage +1+3 \) \
    \( +clone -repage +2+4 \) \
    \( +clone -repage +2+5 \) \
    \( +clone -repage +3+6 \) \
  -background none -compose DstOver -mosaic rose-thickness.jpg
</pre>
</p><p>
2) A raised button effect:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ convert -raise 8x8 rose.jpg rose-raised.jpg
</pre>
</p><p>
3) Adding a frame to the thumbnail:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$convert -mattecolor peru -frame 9x9+3+3 rose.jpg rose-frame.jpg
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9696f1.large.jpg"><img src="9696f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Image with Frame
</p></div></div><p>
Next, let's look at some interesting ways to annotate images with
ImageMagick:
</p><p>
1) Text on the bottom-left corner with a vertical orientation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ convert rose.jpg -font helvetica -fill white \
  -pointsize 20 -gravity southwest -annotate \
  270x270+15+0 'Nice pink rose' rose-text.jpg
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9696f2.large.jpg"><img src="9696f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Image with Text
</p></div></div><p>
2) Text on a frame:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ montage -geometry +0+0 -background white -fill \
  brown -label 'Nice pink rose' rose.jpg rose-text.jpg
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that you can give any color to the -background and -fill switches. To
find which colors are supported by ImageMagick, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ convert -list color
</pre>
</p><p>
3) You also can watermark, like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ convert rose.jpg -font helvetica -pointsize 20 -draw \
    "gravity south  \
      fill black text 0,12 'Nice pink rose' \
      fill white text 1,11 'Nice pink rose' " rose-text.jpg
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9696f3.large.jpg"><img src="9696f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Image with Watermarking 
</p></div></div><p>
4) Label the image on the top like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ convert rose.jpg -gravity North -background green \
  -splice 0x18 -draw "text 0,0 'Nice \
  pink rose' " rose-top.jpg
</pre>
</p><p>
You can create a video from the images using mencoder or FFmpeg.
But before that, let's first create the horizontal
and vertical mirror images of the snaps. It will be interesting to
combine the images with the mirrors while playing the video:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$convert rose.jpg -flip rose-flip.jpg
$convert rose.jpg -flop rose-flop.jpg
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1859580.0x1d4b1c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
These two commands create the vertical and horizontal mirror images,
respectively.
</p><p>
You can combine the mirrors with the original with the append switch
to convert:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$convert rose.jpg rose-flip.jpg -append rose-vertical.jpg
</pre>
</p><p>
Instead of -append, if you specify +append, it creates the images
side by side, which is what we want to do with horizontal mirror images:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$convert rose.jpg rose-flop.jpg +append rose-horiz.jpg
</pre>
</p><p>
You might consider using the -resize option or -scale option to convert
all images to identical dimensions:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mencoder "mf://*.jp" -mf fps=0.5:type=jpg -o \
  image-video.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mjpeg
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates an image video with all the images displaying one after
another at an interval of one image every two seconds (fps=0.5). But, bear
in mind that all the images need to have identical
dimensions, or this will not work.
</p><p>
Now, you can combine this with a nice audio file to create a video that
is playable on a DVD:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ lav2yuv +n image-video.avi | mpeg2enc -f 8 -o image-video.m2v
$ mplex -f 8 audio.ac3 image-video.m2v -o final-video.mpg
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, simply copy the final-video.mpg into your DVD and you are done.
</p><p>
You can generate the black-and-white equivalents of a color image using
this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ xloadimage rose.jpg -dump jpeg,grayscale rose-bw.jpg
</pre>

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
To create an image gallery application, you need to obtain
the thumbnails, border style of images, audio file for the
background music and the text for annotating each image. You also can
give the user the opportunity to specify a particular annotation style.
</p><p>
Once you have these inputs, you can use the command-line ImageMagick tools
to create a gallery and use a simple shell script to link them all
together with HTML and produce a Web page.
