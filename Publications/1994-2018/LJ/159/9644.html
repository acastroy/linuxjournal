Portland, Oregon, is a city that takes pride in managing its resources
wisely. So, maybe it's natural that this article describes how to
make computer resources and legacy CGI scripts much more manageable.
This is accomplished by an elegant, easy-to-build system that provides
benefits in three different areas. For starters, it gives programmers a
one-line solution for controlling access to any script. Meanwhile, on the
back end, it provides administrators with a friendly Web-based application for
managing access. Finally, and maybe most important, the system creates
an experience for end users that's logical and simple. For example,
people are required to log in only once when they first attempt to
access a protected script. Afterward, they'll have uninterrupted access
to any other protected areas if they're authorized to enter.
</p><p>
Here's a little bit of context to see why this kind of system might
be needed. I work at Lewis &amp; Clark College, nestled in 137 deeply
wooded acres. While I sit on one end of campus with the aroma of wet
Douglas Fir trees drifting in through the window, our Web applications
are increasingly being used by staff members in new ways and in far-flung
locations. We have an excellent LDAP-based authentication system that's
managed by IT. People can log in to dozens of different applications,
from many places on the hilly campus with their one user name and password.
The programmers have well-tested Perl and PHP libraries that tie into
this system.
</p><p>
You might be wondering, So what's the problem? Why build another layer
on top of something that's working? And actually, for a long time,
there was no need. The existing setup was just fine. But over time,
we began having growing pains, coming from several sources.
</p><p>
The number of Perl CGI applications for internal users has been 
growing steadily. These apps are increasingly tailored for very specific tasks
and are intended to be used by only a small group of people.
</p><p>
These legacy applications were developed over a period of years by many
different developers. Although they each used the LDAP system described
above, they handled sessions, cookies and access in different ways.
</p><p>
A whole set of new scripts required protected access for certain user
groups. We had no good way of keeping track of or managing who would
be able to access what.
</p><p>
As a software engineer, my first thought was to create a small reusable
library of some kind so that code wouldn't be duplicated. I would
write the code for logging in and session management just once and use
it in many places. But, before I got started, I realized there were
a couple deeper issues I should address.
</p><p>
We ought to handle and support the notion of <span   class="emphasis"><em>roles</em></span> directly. Up to
this point, our software had focused on <span   class="emphasis"><em>users</em></span>, the actual people who
would be using the software. But in fact, our users each have many roles,
and one role may be performed by many people as well.
</p><p>
The existing scripts combined two distinct functions that would be better
kept separate: authentication and authorization. Authentication is the
process of determining whether users are who they say they are. Authorization
is the process of deciding should user X be able to do thing Y?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1571580.0x16697c0"></a>
Building the Solution</h2></div></div><p>
The plan for the new system features three independent pieces: a
database containing the knowledge of users and their roles, a Ruby on
Rails application for administrators to manage the database, and a set
of adapter libraries for each application programming environment in use.
For our scenario, I wrote a Perl module to connect our legacy applications
to the new framework (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9644f1.large.jpg"><img src="9644f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. System Architecture
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1571580.0x1669a80"></a>
The Back End</h2></div></div><p>
It was fairly simple to create an appropriate knowledge base for this
project. We used MySQL, but any relational database supported by both
Ruby on Rails and Perl would be fine. The database schema is the standard solution
for handling a many-to-many relationship (Figure 2).
The admin_users table is simply a list of user names. Simple inclusion
in the table doesn't grant a user any rights. It provides
only the possibility for that user to be linked with roles. Similarly,
the admin_roles table enumerates and describes only the roles that users
may or may not be assigned to. I included a description field so that
administrators could document the intended use of a role. In this simple
schema, a role name might be office manager or news editor.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9644f2.large.jpg"><img src="9644f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Database Schema
</p></div></div><p>
While the first two tables are essentially static, the final table,
admin_roles_admin_users, captures the dynamic information about which
users have been assigned to which roles. For each instance of a
particular user having a particular role, a new record will be created
in this table. This kind of schema is very pure and flexible, but the
flipside is that it makes it nearly impossible to enter data by hand,
and somewhat of a chore to write an application to manage it. This is
where Ruby on Rails comes in.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1571580.0x1669d98"></a>
Front End #1: a Management Application</h2></div></div><p>
Ruby on Rails (RoR) shines in the area of database applications that
need to provide CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) functionality.
It was a simple and easy task to get our database management application up
and running (Figure 3). Plenty
of good tutorials are available for creating a basic RoR Web application,
so in this article I describe only the necessary customizations.
As it turned out, there weren't many.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9644f3.large.jpg"><img src="9644f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Admin Application, Role Listing
</p></div></div><p>
The first thing to note is that I carefully chose the names of the tables
and columns to comply with Ruby on Rails naming conventions (Figure
2). This turned out to be a bit tricky; I couldn't find a single source
for all the conventions and their implications. In this situation with
a join table (admin_roles_admin_users), it was important to concatenate
the names in alphabetical order and not to include an id column.
</p><p>
The main customization necessary was to tell RoR about the many-to-many
relationship. This was accomplished with a single line added to
admin_role.rb:

<pre     class="programlisting">

class AdminRole &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :admin_users
end	

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1571580.0x166a160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and an equivalent one in admin_user.rb:


<pre     class="programlisting">

class AdminUser &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :admin_roles
end

</pre>
</p><p>
With these changes, RoR could work with the data correctly and maintain
all the proper relationships. In order actually to display and edit the
join information, a bit more work was required in the view and controller
classes (see Resources).
When finished, I had nice screens, such as the one shown in Figure 4.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9644f4.large.jpg"><img src="9644f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Admin Application, Editing a Role
</p></div></div><p>
With the administrative application in place, we could begin populating
the database. But for this information actually to be used, an adapter
would have to be written for our Perl/CGI runtime environment.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1571580.0x166a528"></a>
Front End #2: a Perl/CGI Adapter</h2></div></div><p>
I'm a big fan of declarative (as opposed to procedural) programming,
when it can be used. What does this mean? Well, one way to check for
authorization might look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
my $username = $auth-&gt;currrent_user;
if (! $username) {
  # Handle the login form
} elsif (! $auth-&gt;user_has_role($username, news editor)) {
  # Show error message and exit
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure, that could be simplified a bit&mdash;for example, by implementing
a current_user_has_role() method. But it's still procedural, telling
the computer what to do. Instead, we can reduce this to one line by
telling the computer (declaring) what we <span   class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$auth-&gt;require_role(news editor);
</pre>
</p><p>
This require_role() method means this role is required to get any further,
and it gives a very simple guarantee: execution will proceed beyond
this point only if the current user should be able to. If the user 1)
already has logged in and 2) has the given role, then require_role()
will simply return and the script will continue executing normally.
Otherwise, the $auth object will take whatever steps are necessary to
first authenticate and then either grant or deny access to users
based on their assigned roles.
</p><p>
This makes a lot of things easier. For application programmers, it
means they don't have to worry about how the $auth object does its job.
Nor do they have to worry about whether they got their ifs and elsifs
written correctly. All they
need to worry about is what role is appropriate for that script. It was
honestly a lot of fun to implement the Auth.pm Perl module and watch so
much happen with so little effort required by the application programmer.
Figure 5 is a flowchart that shows what happens when require_role is invoked.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9644f5.large.jpg"><img src="9644f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Auth.pm Flowchart
</p></div></div><p>
Concretely, my implementation required only four short files:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Auth.pm: the gatekeeper for the system. It implements the business
logic of checking first for authentication and second for
authorization.
</p></li><li><p>
login.tt2 (using Template Toolkit): renders a login form with embedded
hidden values to keep track of the originally requested destination
page. The results of the login attempt are sent to auth_login.cgi.
</p></li><li><p>
auth_error.tt2: renders an error page, letting users know that they
don't have the required authorization to access the script.
</p></li><li><p>
auth_login.cgi: responsible for the simple task of authenticating the
user and restarting the access checking. In our case, it connects to
the LDAP system and looks to see if the given login information is correct.
If it is, then this fact is saved in a session/cookie, and the originally
requested CGI script is re-executed.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Here are the most important sections of each file: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
auth.pm: The heart of this module is the require_role() method. It contains
the control logic for the whole process. In my implementation, I use
CGI.pm in the OO style, so I pass it in as a parameter. Notice how
the use of return vs. exit controls the user's experience:


<pre     class="programlisting">
sub require_role {
    #
    # Ensure that the user is logged in and has the 
    # specified role.
    #
    my $self = shift;
    my $role = shift;
    my $cgi  = shift;
	
    if (! $role) {
           confess("No role was specified");
    }
    if (! $cgi) {
           confess("No CGI object was given");
    }
	
    my $uname = $self-&gt;get_authentication_info();
    if ($uname) {
            # The user has been authenticated.
            if ($self-&gt;user_has_role($uname, $role)) {
                    # Success - continue.
                    return;
            } else {
                    # Failure - the user does not have 
                    # the specified role.
                    $self-&gt;_display_error_page($cgi);
                    exit;
            }
     } else {
	     # The user has NOT been authenticated.
             $self-&gt;_display_login_page($cgi);
             exit;
    }
}
</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
login.tt2: Template Toolkit is an awesome way to create HTML pages. I could have
achieved the same thing with a here document in Perl, but this is much
cleaner. It also allows the template to be executed from both Auth.pm
and auth_login.cgi.


<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;p&gt;Please login to access &lt;b&gt;[% target_page %]&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;	
&lt;form method="POST" action="/cgi-bin/auth_login.cgi"&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;User name:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="username"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td&gt;Password:&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input name="password" type="password"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td colspan="2" align="right"&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="target_url" value="[% target_url %]"&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="target_page" value="[% target_page %]"&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Login"&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

[% IF error_message %]
&lt;p style="color: #ff0000"&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;[% error_message %]&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
[% END %]

</pre>
</p></li><li><p>
auth_login.cgi: finally, here is the key section from the login form handler. This is
a very simple script:


<pre     class="programlisting">

if (&amp;ldapauth($name, $pass)) {
  # Success: Create a session, and
  # redirect to the target page.
  &amp;create_session($name);
  print "&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;";
  print '&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=' . $target_url . '"&gt;';
  print "&lt;/head&gt;&lt;/html&gt;";
} else {
  # Failure: Re-display the login form with an
  # error message.
  print $q-&gt;header;
  &amp;redisplay_page("Login failed: password incorrect.", 
       $target_page, 
       $target_url);
}

</pre>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
With all the pieces in place, we're ready to go. Here's a simple Perl
CGI script that we want to try to protect:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/usr/bin/perl
use CGI;
my $q = CGI-&gt;new();
print $q-&gt;header;

print &lt;&lt;EOF;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor="#ee3333"&gt;
  &lt;p align="center" style="color: white"&gt;This 
              is a TOP SECRET page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
EOF

</pre>
</p><p>
It creates the output shown in Figure 6. 
But, now let's modify it to use the new framework:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/usr/bin/perl
use CGI;
use Auth;

my $q = CGI-&gt;new();

my $a = LC::Auth-&gt;new;
$a-&gt;require_role( 'top-secret stuff', $q);

print $q-&gt;header;
print &lt;&lt;EOF;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor="#ee3333"&gt;
  &lt;p align="center" style="color: white"&gt;This 
          is a TOP SECRET page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
EOF

</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9644f6.large.jpg"><img src="9644f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Unprotected Page
</p></div></div><p>
After making this simple change, reloading the browser now shows the
same URL, but instead of the top-secret contents, we see a login form
(Figure 7).
Logging in correctly will do several things in the
blink of an eye: send the information to auth_login.cgi, which will verify it,
and then store the logged-in state in a session; redirect to the initial
page, which will re-execute require_role(), which now finds the session,
verifies role membership with the MySQL database; and then returns,
allowing the script to display the content. But, as far as users are
concerned, after submitting the login form, their application simply
appears.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9644f7.large.jpg"><img src="9644f7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Login Form
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1571580.0x1a63958"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This simple collection of a few short Web scripts provides a surprising
array of benefits. Login functionality is factored out into a reusable
module for Web scripts. Users and roles are now understood by the
system. Authorization is separated from authentication. Single sign-on
is provided, because one session/cookie is checked by all scripts.
The functionality is language- and environment-independent. Easy-to-add
custom login templates provide a seamless user experience. And, changes in role
assignments take effect in real time, because the role database is
consulted every time a script is invoked.
</p><p>
I see this as the payoff for putting in a little bit of time up front
to investigate the problem, and plan a good solution. Another factor
that contributed to this project's success is the use of Ruby on Rails
for back-end data management. I envision that in the future, we'll have
suites of application components such as this that adapt to the needs
of our users on the front end. And behind the scenes, we'll quickly deploy
management applications with tools such as Rails.
