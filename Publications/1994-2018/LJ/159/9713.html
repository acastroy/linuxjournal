<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #159, July 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>DevFS</b></span> entry in the MAINTAINERS file is no longer marked obsolete. It has
now been completely removed from that file, and the last vestige of the old
DevFS code is gone. An interesting facet of this history is that <span   class="bold"><b>udev</b></span>,
which has replaced DevFS, is now subject to its own brand of controversy,
albeit completely different from what surrounded DevFS. Some vendors are
finding that they can't make good use of udev without using MODULE_LICENSE()
to release their code under the GPL. With such fundamental parts of the
kernel insisting on the GPL for third-party modules, it soon may be
difficult for any binary-only kernel drivers to exist at all.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>JFFS</b></span> is gone. The code has been removed from the kernel, and the maintainer
entry has been removed from the MAINTAINERS file. This is all well and good,
because <span   class="bold"><b>JFFS2</b></span> has superseded JFFS for a long time, and any lingering JFFS
users out there really should switch over to JFFS2.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>parallel port code</b></span>, once such a key part of many users' systems, is now
unmaintained. <span   class="bold"><b>David Brownell</b></span> had been unsuccessful at contacting any of the
four folks listed in the MAINTAINERS file under that entry, and finally,
he posted a patch marking the code unmaintained. <span   class="bold"><b>Jean
Delvare</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Randy Dunlap</b></span>
both support the change, and <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> seems likely to accept it. If
you're interested in seeing the parallel port code stay in the kernel, now's
your chance to speak up and take it over.
</p><p>
As <span   class="bold"><b>Vassili Karpov</b></span> has discovered to his
dismay, <span   class="bold"><b>CPU stats</b></span> are not accurately
reported in /proc/stat on the PC architecture. On that architecture, CPU
usage is examined only during the timer interrupt, so regular programs can
seem to use much more or much less of the CPU, just because they happen to
be either very active or idle at those particular intervals. This also
explains why users might see a difference in CPU usage when switching their
kernel from running at 100Hz to 1,000Hz. In fact, the usage is unchanged,
while only the accounting is different. Programs like top, which get their
CPU stats from /proc/stat, will suffer from this kind of discrepancy.
Vassili and his friends wasted quite a bit of time trying to optimize some
code they were working on, until they discovered that they were optimizing
toward an inaccurate and ever-changing goal.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>kbuild system</b></span> is likely to get some new maturity indicators to go along
with &ldquo;Experimental&rdquo;. It's been suggested that
&ldquo;Deprecated&rdquo; and &ldquo;Obsolete&rdquo;
would be some nice additions. The only problem is that folks currently seem
unable to agree on the meaning of those terms. To some folks,
&ldquo;Obsolete&rdquo;
means a replacement is available; although to others, it means the code is
completely dead and unsupported. It's very likely that these disagreements
will resolve themselves in the relatively near term; everyone seems to agree
that kbuild will be improved by having some kind of additional maturity
indicators.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>kernel.org</b></span> folks have forked <span   class="bold"><b>gitweb</b></span>, because the gitweb maintainers were
not responsive enough to their bug reports. However, it turns out that the
kernel.org folks don't have the time to maintain gitweb themselves, so
they are missing out on important improvements being made to the upstream
tree. At the same time, the gitweb maintainers did seem to be gathering up
bug fixes eventually. It seems as though this particular code fork may be
short-lived.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Deepak Saxena</b></span> has modified the kernel to make sure it can build under a
<span   class="bold"><b>Cygwin</b></span> environment. Some people may wonder why the kernel developers would
bother supporting a kernel development environment under Windows, but as
Deepak puts it, this environment &ldquo;is unfortunately used by more people than
one would think in the embedded world&rdquo;. His patch, it turns out, is a bit
hacky, and <span   class="bold"><b>H. Peter Anvin</b></span> has asked him to include various appropriate
comments to make sure anyone touching the code doesn't break Cygwin
support.

<h2 class="title">lighttpd Is in the House</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #159, July 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In April 2007, Netcraft's monthly survey (<a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/04/02/april_2007_web_server_survey.html" target="_self">news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/04/02/april_2007_web_server_survey.html</a>)
showed a new entry in its top five Web servers: lighttpd
(<a href="http://www.lighttpd.net" target="_self">www.lighttpd.net</a>). At that point, Lighty (or
lighttpd)
clocked in at 1.4 million sites, not including the reported Apache sites
hosted by OpenSourceParking (<a href="http://opensourceparking.com" target="_self">opensourceparking.com</a>)
that
Netcraft claims may actually have been running lighttpd. Says Netcraft,
&ldquo;The opensourceparking.com headers say Apache, but have the Date
&amp;
Server headers last, a pattern which is identical to the lighttpd
response and entirely unlike a typical Apache response. The etag is also
not in Apache format, and matches the lighttpd format&rdquo; (<a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/04/04/open_source_parking_spoofing_headers_to_benefit_apache.html" target="_self">news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/04/04/open_source_parking_spoofing_headers_to_benefit_apache.html</a>).

</p><p>
Jan Kneschke began work on lighttpd in 2003, when he wanted to develop a
fast and lightweight alternative to Apache. Since then, a community has
grown around lighttpd, which has its own home (with a blog, a wiki and a
forum) at lighttpd.net. The description there goes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
lighttpd is a
secure, fast, compliant and very flexible Webserver that has been
optimized for high-performance environments. It has a very low memory
footprint compared to other Webservers and takes care of CPU load. Its
advanced feature set (FastCGI, CGI, Auth, Output-Compression,
URL-Rewriting and many more) makes lighttpd the perfect
Webserver-software for every server that suffers load problems.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Meanwhile, Apache (in April 2007) stood at a 58.63% share of the Netcraft
surveyed sites, running roughly flat month to month after it dropped
about the same 5% that Microsoft servers gained in April of last year.
Don't be surprised to see lighttpd and Apache combine to increase
open-source server market shares, while also increasing choice. Watch
Netcraft (<a href="http://news.netcraft.com" target="_self">news.netcraft.com</a>) for more developments.

<h2 class="title">Palming Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Doc Searls</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #159, July 2007</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The term PDA (personal digital assistant) was coined in 1992 by Apple
CEO John Sculley to name a category for a new class of handheld devices,
inaugurated by Apple's Newton. Sculley moved on and Newton flopped, but
the category stayed. Starting with the Palm Pilot in 1996, the Palm
brand has been synonymous with the PDA category, even as the company
called Palm has gone through multiple incarnations and the most familiar
PDAs are also cell phones.
</p><p>
From the beginning, Palm has had its own operating system, called PalmOS
(Garnet). In recent years, the company has added Windows Mobile for use
in some of its cell-phone PDAs. (For example, the Palm Treo 700 comes in
Palm and Windows versions.)
</p><p>
Then, at its Analyst and Investor Day in April 2007, Palm announced plans to
moosh its PalmOS development together with development atop the Linux
kernel, along with plans to come out with Linux-based Palm products
before the end of this year. We don't have more specifics at press time,
but we do have a copy of a visual used by Palm at the announcement (Figure
1).

Scarcity models are by definition not scale-free; a hit culture
prevails. Open source, given the lower barriers to entry, allows someone
to build left-handed credit derivatives juicer because he felt like
it. There's a long-tail effect. You are more likely to find esoteric
tools in an open-source world than in a closed-source one. Open-source
people don't go around asking, &ldquo;Is there a market for this?&rdquo; They solve
problems and see if others have similar problems to solve.
