They say a picture is worth a thousand words. As videos could be
25 pictures per second and might last several minutes, how many
words is that?
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1111580.0x12093f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Fran&ccedil;ois, what are you doing still sitting in front of your
computer? Our guests will be here any moment. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> I
appreciate,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, that you are teaching your Aunt Marguerite to
use Linux,
but must you do it in real time over a VNC control session? Of course
there are other ways, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. For instance, you could
create
instructional videos, screencasts, and e-mail them to her. Yes, I
would be happy to show you how, but for now, you must say <span   class="emphasis"><em>Au
revoir</em></span>
to your aunt and log off. I can see our guests coming up the walkway now.
</p><p>
Welcome everyone, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>, where great Linux
and open-source software meets great wine, and of course, great
people. <span   class="emphasis"><em>C'est fantastique</em></span> to see you all here tonight.
Please,
sit and make yourselves comfortable. Fran&ccedil;ois! To the wine cellar,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>. Bring back the 2003 Ch&acirc;teau Maris Minervois
Old Vine
Grenache from the south wing. I remember seeing a half-dozen cases there.
</p><p>
Before you arrived, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, Fran&ccedil;ois and I were
discussing
approaches for showing people how to use various software packages,
perhaps for teaching a friend or relative how to use a Linux desktop. I
suggested
that rather than resorting to remote control sessions, it might be more
efficient to create small training videos and use those instead. Besides,
instead of reaching one person, this way you could reach many. This is
popularly
referred to as screencasting. Creating screencasts doesn't have to be
difficult, and the features on tonight's menu will have you creating your
own in no time.
</p><p>
The first program I'd like to show you is Zaheer Abbas Merali's
Istanbul, a screen recording program that sits quietly in
your system tray, waiting to be called on. The program is available
from <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Istanbul" target="_self">live.gnome.org/Istanbul</a>. Source (both stable and
development) is available from the Istanbul site as well as Debian
packages. And, packages for other distributions are easily located,
for example, at <a href="http://rpmfind.net" target="_self">rpmfind.net</a>.
</p><p>
To start Istanbul, simply run the command name,
<tt  >istanbul</tt>. When
you do, a small red icon appears in the system tray. Right-click
on the system tray icon (a small red circle at this point), and a small
pop-up menu appears (Figure 1). From here, you can make a number of
changes in Istanbul's default recording. For instance, you may choose to
make a smaller recording by selecting half width and height instead of
full size. You also can choose to record your entire desktop or select
a specific area to record. If you do the latter, Istanbul provides you with
a large X cursor that you can drag around the area you want to record.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9716f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Access
Istanbul's settings by right-clicking the red circle in your system
tray.
</p></div></div><p>
I should alert you to one other very important point, mostly because
I scratched my head for some time on this one. Notice that there is also
a selection labeled Record Sound. You need to enable that if you
want to add sound to a screencast.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1111580.0x1209d40"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Tip:</b></p><p>
As I was writing this article, the Istanbul
development package also gave the option of selecting an
active window, usually an easier choice than selecting an area for
recording.
</p></div><p>
To start recording, simply click the red button. It changes to
a gray square while you record your session. Talk clearly into your
microphone and demonstrate the steps in the window you selected as you
explain the process. When you are done recording, click the
gray button. A dialog labeled Save Screencast appears (Figure 2).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9716f2.large.jpg"><img src="9716f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Istanbul
saves its videos in the free and open standard OGG format.
</p></div></div><p>
On the left-hand side of that dialog, there's a preview window
showing your captured video. To preview it before saving it, click
the Play button below the preview window. On the top left, you can
enter a file for your video and select a folder in which to save it. As you
might have guessed from the save dialog, this is a GNOME application,
but it works very well under KDE also.
</p><p>
Note that Istanbul saves in OGG format, so if you want something
else, you have to convert it after the fact using a program like
FFmpeg or mencoder. Many Linux distributions come with
a copy of FFmpeg or provide it on their repositories. Using it
is pretty simple. For instance, to convert an OGG video to an AVI file,
you might use this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ffmpeg -i recording.ogg newrecording.avi
</pre>
</p><p>
As you might expect, there's a lot more to the program, but it can
be this simple. For a whole lot more on FFmpeg, check your on-line
documentation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1111580.0x120a318"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Usually, the reason for doing this converting, is to provide
videos that your friends running another operating system can view. Or,
you could direct them to download OGG codecs instead, so they will be able
to enjoy
completely free video and audio.
</p></div><p>
The next item on this star-studded menu, is John Varouhakis'
recordMyDesktop, a desktop screencasting program that
includes both a command-line tool and a graphical front end,
gtk-recordMyDesktop. You can pick up a copy of gtk-recordMydesktop
from <a href="http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net" target="_self">recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net</a>. For the purpose
of this
demonstration, I concentrate on the graphical client rather than the
command-line version.
</p><p>
When you start gtk-recordMyDesktop, a simple recording dialog appears
(Figure 3). On the left-hand side of the program, there's a preview
pane with a button labeled Select Window directly underneath. Before you
begin recording, click the window you want to capture. You'll see
it outlined in red in the preview pane. To record the whole desktop, click
on an empty (or shall we say, uncluttered) portion of your desktop. Adjust
video
and sound quality using the sliders on the top right. To
begin recording, click the red Record button. When you do that, the
dialog vanishes.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9716f3.large.jpg"><img src="9716f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Creating a screencast with gtk-recordMyDesktop is as easy
as clicking the Record button.
</p></div></div><p>
If you are paying attention, you might notice something that looks
a little like Istanbul here. It's that little red circle sitting in
your system tray. This similarity isn't entirely accidental. Parts
of Istanbul are in gtk-recordMyDesktop. Incidentally, another way to
start a recording is to click the red system tray icon. It then
changes to a gray square while you record your session. When you click
it again, the recording stops and you return to the gtk-recordMyDesktop
window. Although there's no preview of your recording, you can
save it by clicking the Save As button.
</p><p>
Let's take a closer look at another part of the interface, the Advanced
settings. Clicking the Advanced button brings up a more comprehensive
settings dialog with four tabs (Figure 4). In Figure 4, I've
highlighted the Performance tab, which controls frames per second,
on-the-fly encoding and more. Changing settings here makes higher quality
screencasts possible, but keep in mind that doing this impacts system
performance, and you may require more horsepower to achieve good results.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9716f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Depending on your system's power, you may want to adjust some
performance-related settings.
</p></div></div><p>
The Files tab has two functions. It allows you to define your
working directory (/tmp is the default), and it lets you
decide whether you want to overwrite files as they are recorded. The
resulting videos are saved to out.ogg. Subsequent writes
will use out.ogg.1 and so on. If you would rather have
gtk-recordMyDesktop overwrite the file each time, check the appropriate
box on the Files tab. Under the Sound tab, you can change the number of
audio channels, the frequency and the audio device location. Finally,
under the Misc tab, you'll find primarily visual settings, such as the
appearance of the mouse cursor in your videos.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1111580.0x120aaa8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b></b></p><p>
What's an article on screencasts without some
screencasts to watch? To see these tools in action, visit Marcel's site at

</p></div><p>
For the KDE users out there, Marios Andreopoulos has created
reKordmydesktop, a feature-rich and fantastic front end to
recordMyDesktop. This program is a single Kommander script, and as such,
it doesn't require a complicated installation, but you do need to have
Kommander installed. Save the file to your desktop (or any location
you please) and click on it. The reKordmydesktop dialog (Figure 5)
appears, ready to do your bidding.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9716f5.large.jpg"><img src="9716f5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. reKordmydesktop
provides a rich, easy-to-use interface for creating screencasts.
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see, the GUI does add some great flexibility, starting with
a definable location and name for your OGG file. Everything you need
is covered under these three tabs, although most of what you'll want
is on the Common Settings tab. Let's look at a few of those, starting
with sound. To record audio, make sure you click the Capture Sound
check box. You can specify a time delay to your recordings&mdash;you can
screencast reKordmydesktop, so you may want to minimize it first when
capturing the whole desktop&mdash;or set a time limit on the recording
(look in the Chrono section). By default, reKordmydesktop captures
the entire desktop. To select a window, click the Grab Window button
on the left, and click on the program window you want to capture (again,
you even can click reKordmydesktop if you choose). To start recording,
simply click the Record button.
</p><p>
One thing I like about this program is that you can pause
a recording, change things around, then continue by clicking Pause
again. When you are done, click Stop, and the OGG file is written
to disk.
</p><p>
Let's have another look at that three-tabbed interface. Under the
Encoding Settings tab, audio and video settings can be changed and
tweaked to give you a recording that balances your system's performance
to provide the best quality possible. This might include dropping frames,
selecting multichannel audio or choosing a higher sampling rate. The
Advanced Settings tab allows you to select an alternate cursor (or none),
change the working directory and more. If you think you've gone and
changed things for the worse, there's a handy Restore Default Settings
button here as well.
</p><p>
And that, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, is what we call a wrap. The system
clock,
sadly, does not lie, and closing time is nearly upon us. I invite each and
every one of you to try your own screencasts. Post them to your blogs,
Web sites or even YouTube. Show others how much fun Linux and open-source
software can be. In the meantime, perhaps Fran&ccedil;ois will be so kind as
to refill your glasses once more. Until next time, please raise your
glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, and let us all drink to one
another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
