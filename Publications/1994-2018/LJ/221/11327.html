The Linux Professional Institute's Linux Essentials Program</h2></div></div><p>
With youth
unemployment around the world holding at crisis levels, the new Linux
Essentials Program from The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) couldn't come
at a more auspicious time. The new certification program, consisting of an
exam and Certificate of Achievement, introduces new users and youth to Linux
and open-source software. The program's main topics include the Linux
Community, careers in open source, popular operating systems, important
applications, licensing issues and the basics of the command line, files and
scripts. Other program elements include regional links to employment and
apprenticeship programs; support for skills competitions, such as
Worldskills International; and support for teacher collaboration and sharing
of learning exercises. A &ldquo;low-stakes&rdquo; exam is available on-line either through
the LPI or Internet-based testing via partners. Linux Essentials currently
is available at select LPI affiliate locations and IT events in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa.

Sara Baase's <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Gift of Fire</em></span>, 4th ed. (Prentice Hall)</h2></div></div><p>
During its relatively brief history, our dynamic Linux Community has had an
outsized interest in and influence on the public dialogue concerning the role
technology in society. An outlet for us Linuxers to scratch our inner
philosophical itch is to chew on the ideas found in the new 4th edition of
Sara Baase's book <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for
Computing Technology</em></span>. As indicated by the title, Baase's work explores the
social, legal, philosophical, ethical, political, constitutional and economic
implications of computing and the controversies they raise. With a computer
scientist's perspective, and with historical context for many issues, Baase
covers the issues we face both as members of a technological society and as
professionals in computer-related fields. Baase's primary goal is to encourage
current and future computer professionals to understand the implications of
what they create and how it fits into society at large.

Brian W. Fitzpatrick and Ben Collins-Sussman's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Team
Geek</em></span> (O'Reilly
Media)</h2></div></div><p>
People are rational and predictable. [Editor's note: Let's try that again.]
Sometimes people can be irrational and unpredictable. As a trained software
engineer, you're probably a whiz with computer languages, compilers,
debuggers and algorithms. But how much real training did you get in dealing
with the human side of software development? If your answer is a predictable
&ldquo;not much&rdquo;, crack open Brian W. Fitzpatrick and Ben
Collins-Sussman's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Team Geek: A Software Developer's Guide to Working
Well with Others</em></span>. Authors Fitzpatrick and Collins-Sussman, producers of the
popular video series, &ldquo;Working with Poisonous People&rdquo;, cover the basic
patterns and anti-patterns for working with other people, teams and users
while trying to develop software. Readers learn how to deal with imperfect
people and discover why playing well with others is at least as important as
having great technical skills. By internalizing the techniques in this book,
publisher O'Reilly says that readers will get more software written, be more
influential and happier in their careers.

TalentSoft</h2></div></div><p>
Enterprises frequently experience a gulf between managerial needs and the
ability of the human resources department to deliver appropriate talent to
address those needs. &ldquo;Problem solved&rdquo;, says TalentSoft, thanks to the
new TS Spring'12 release of its SaaS-based Integrated Talent and Competencies
Management application, which now incorporates the best social networks
practices into its collaborative talent management solution. Employees gain
control over their careers; managers benefit from greater autonomy, and HR
managers increase their productivity by focusing on high value-added tasks. TS
Spring'12 adds two new core features: TS SocialConnect and TS
TalentOffice. TS SocialConnect is a solution that helps employers leverage
more than 300 social networks toward strengthening brands and attracting the best
profiles. TS TalentOffice allows HR departments to draw upon their existing
resources to generate customized spreadsheet-based reports and word-processing
documents.

Logic Supply's LGX CT100 Open Chassis</h2></div></div><p>
Logic Supply designed the new LGX CT100 Open Chassis to solve the space and
installation challenges involved with securing Mini-ITX (or 3.5")
mainboards and other system components within larger enclosures, such as
cabinets and kiosks. The CT100 is a &ldquo;case option&rdquo; designed to be an
open mounting plate solution fitting into an existing electrical cabinet,
kiosk or piece of manufacturing equipment. The result, says Logic Supply, is
a compact, enclosure-free home for all the IT equipment with the benefit of
convenient accessibility to those who need to maintain the IT over time.
Absence of physical enclosure means that many different system configurations
are available and the full range of Mini-ITX and 3.5" motherboards and
power-supply options are supported. Logic Supply also designed the CT100 with
bench-top configuration testing in mind: it holds all parts safely during
system debugging and prototyping. A range of mounting provisions are
available, with only a DIN rail or screw studs required for attachment of the
plate to the enclosure.

Belongs Inc.'s Belon.gs Global Lost &amp; Found Service</h2></div></div><p>
Losing stuff has long been accepted as a frustrating yet quintessential part
of the universal human condition. A team of resourceful Finns&mdash;and who
loves resourceful Finns more than we do?&mdash;is launching the Belon.gs
Global Lost &amp; Found Web and mobile service to help unfortunate folks worldwide
recover lost important belongings. To utilize the service, customers
register at Belon.gs and attach QR code tag stickers to their valuables. If an
item should go missing, the finder can scan the tag's QR code with a
smartphone or access the Web address on the tag. The owner is automatically
notified and anonymous chat is established between the two parties to arrange
the return of the lost item. To promote the returning of valuables, Belon.gs
supports setting rewards for found items through PayPal, and the Belongs
technology will streamline the transfer of the reward from owner to finder.
The aforementioned Finns envision a better world with Belong.gs&mdash;a world
without the unnecessary grief that comes from losing your valuables.

Cryptzone's AppGate MOVE</h2></div></div><p>
James Bond would effortlessly foil many a cyber threat if Q would slip him an
AppGate MOVE (My Own Virtual Environment) from Cryptzone, a USB Flash drive
that provides a portable way to access information and applications securely
from virtually any computer. By working independently of the host device's
operating system, the bootable AppGate MOVE allows secure remote working and
eliminates risk from malware infection. Cryptzone says that the trend for
increased telecommuting calls for a low-cost solution that allows for trusted
access to corporate information from an untrusted computer at home or in a
public space. Working in combination with an AppGate Security Server, this
drive contains a full operating system, the AppGate client, a Web browser, a
Microsoft-compatible Office Suite, e-mail client, a firewall and other
applications required to complete daily tasks. There is no need for an
expensive, dedicated corporate laptop. AppGate MOVE allows users to work
securely because the configuration of the PC is irrelevant and untouched.
Because the local PC hard drive is not used, no residue or evidence is left
when the session to the AppGate server is closed. The AppGateUSB Factory
allows production of unlimited copies of AppGate MOVE.

Crossrider</h2></div></div><p>
Multiple Web browsers are convenient for users but can be a nightmare for
developers, who historically have had to create extensions according to each
browser's unique requirements. A new company, Crossrider, with its
eponymous, cloud-based cross-browser extension development platform, seeks to
make life more pleasant for extension developers. Crossrider lets developers
create cross-browser extensions quickly with a single JavaScript code and
publish to potentially millions of end users immediately. All major browsers
are supported, including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari. The
platform also provides the tools needed to build and manage apps, including
JQuery support, a powerful API and app-boosting Crossrider plugins, which
allow developers to create custom code to extend the Crossrider API and enable
code sharing within the Crossrider developer community. Crossrider also
features a cloud-based IDE that allows developers to create extensions in
real time without downloading a development package. The IDE is equipped with
IntelliSense to enable autocompletion for all Crossrider API methods. Tools
for monetizing and tracking extensions also are included in the platform.
