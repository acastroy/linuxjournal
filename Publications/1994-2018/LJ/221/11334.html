Explaining Linux isn't enough.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2416580.0x250e300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Most people experience Linux the way they experience a light switch or a
water faucet. When they use it, they expect it to work and give them what
they want. And if it doesn't work, they expect an expert to come and make
it work. In their experience, Linux is the business end of infrastructure:
the road, not the rubber that meets it.
</p><p>
But the difference between Linux and water, electricity or a road is that
most people know what those other things are&mdash;and they don't know what
Linux is, even when they've heard of it. That's why we need metaphors like
the above if we're going to explain Linux to them.
</p><p>
But do we really need to explain Linux to people who don't know or care
much about it? And if so, why?
</p><p>
For most of Linux's history, those of us close to the topic believed Linux
mattered enough to deserve understanding by others, especially since we
were certain that Linux would some day achieve what we liked to call World
Domination. Linux has crossed that threshold, but not by the crowning
victory we had hoped for from the start: running on many millions of
personal computing and communication devices and getting full credit for
that, by name. Today, the only form of Linux doing that is Android, which is
&ldquo;Linux-based&rdquo;, rather than Linux itself.
</p><p>
Today, as I write this, news comes that $100 million has been invested in
GitHub, the &ldquo;social coding&rdquo; site that currently hosts millions of code
repositories for millions of people, all using the Git distributed revision
control system created by Linus Torvalds. There are excited stories about
GitHub in the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Forbes</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Reuters</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>TechCrunch</em></span>, the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>San
Francisco Chronicle</em></span>, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Washington Post</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Red Herring</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gigaom</em></span> and dozens of
other mainstream pubs that don't mention Linus at all. I was about to stop
looking when I finally found one: Rafe Needleman, writing in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>CNET</em></span>
(<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57468899-93/github-raises-$100-million-from-andreessen-horowitz" target="_self">news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57468899-93/github-raises-$100-million-from-andreessen-horowitz</a>), credits
Linus right up front. Still, nobody mentions Junio Hamano, who has been
maintaining Git since Linus handed that duty to him July 2005. At the time
of this
writing, Junio's entry in Wikipedia is a three-line stub.
</p><p>
How many $billions have been made because of Linus' founding work? How
many more will be made thanks to Linus' and Junio's work on Git?
</p><p>
A better question: would Linux and Git have succeeded so spectacularly if
Linus had tried to own either of them? No. As Harry Truman said, &ldquo;It is
amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the
credit.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Linux, Git and countless other code bases are working as infrastructural
building materials today because their creators made them free in the first
place. That's what matters&mdash;not who gets the credit. The real problem we
have today is that freedoms embodied in code are barely understood or
credited at all. The same goes for free hardware. And, for lack of that
understanding, we are losing those freedoms today.
</p><p>
Eben Moglen made this fact clear in a speech titled &ldquo;Innovation under
Austerity&rdquo;, which he gave at the Freedom to Connect conference in Silver
Spring, Maryland, in May of this year. I joined Eben on stage for a
conversation after that speech, and opened by saying it was not only one of
the best speeches I'd ever heard, but one of the most important. See the
video (<a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/05/27/innovation-under-austerity-eb.html" target="_self">boingboing.net/2012/05/27/innovation-under-austerity-eb.html</a>) in an excellent posting in BoingBong by Cory Doctorow. The Software
Freedom Law Center has a full transcript as well
(<a href="http://softwarefreedom.org/events/2012/freedom-to-connect_moglen-keynote-2012.html" target="_self">softwarefreedom.org/events/2012/freedom-to-connect_moglen-keynote-2012.html</a>). Here's a compressed
excerpt:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
For the policy makers, in other words, an overwhelming problem is now at
hand: how do we have innovation and economic growth under austerity? They
do not know the answer to this question, and it is becoming so urgent that
it is beginning to deteriorate their political control.
</p><p>
Nobody will ever try to create a commercial encyclopedia again.
</p><p>
Disintermediation, the movement of power out of the middle of the Net is a
crucial fact about 21st century political economy. It proves itself all the
time. Somebody's going to win a Nobel Prize in Economics for
describing, in formal terms, the nature of disintermediation.
</p><p>
The greatest technological innovation of the late 20th century is the thing
we now call the World Wide Web, an invention less than 8,000 days old. That
invention is already transforming human society more rapidly than anything
since the adoption of writing.
</p><p>
What do we know about how to achieve innovation under austerity? We created
the Cloud. We created the idea that we could share operating systems and
all the rest of the commoditizable stack on top of them. We did this using
the curiosity of young people, not venture capital. Venture capital came
towards us not because innovation needed to happen, but because innovation
had already happened.
</p><p>
That curiosity of young people could be harnessed because all of the
computing devices in ordinary day-to-day use were hackable, and so young
people could actually hack on what everybody used. That made it possible
for innovation to occur where it can occur without friction, which is at
the bottom of the pyramid of capital. Hundreds of thousands of young people
around the world hacking on laptops, hacking on servers, hacking on
general-purpose hardware available to allow them to scratch their individual
itches&mdash;technical, career, and just plain ludic itches (&ldquo;I wanna do this; it
would be neat&rdquo;)&mdash;which is the primary source of the innovation which
drove all of the world's great economic expansion in the past ten years.
The way innovation really happens is that you provide young people with
opportunities to create on an infrastructure which allows them to hack the
real world and share the results.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
That's the upside. The downside is this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
All of that innovation comes from the simple process of letting the kids
play and getting out of the way. Which, as you are aware, we are working as
hard as we can to prevent, now, completely. Increasingly, around the world,
the actual computing artifacts of daily life for individual human beings
are being locked so you can't hack them. The individual computing
laboratory in every 12-year-old's pocket is being locked down. If you
prevent people from hacking on what they own themselves, you will destroy
the engine of innovation from which everybody is profiting. The goal of the
network operators is to attach every young human being to a proprietary
network platform with closed terminal equipment that she can't learn from,
can't study, can't understand, can't whet her teeth on, can't do anything
with except send text messages that cost a million times more than they
ought to.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
This paragraph replaces a long digressive harangue I spent two days
writing. I visited patents and copyrights, ACTA and SOPA (both of which
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> readers by now know a great deal), and a new issue: the
Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP, <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp" target="_self">https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp</a>), by which the US is quietly
working to muscle New Zealand
(<a href="http://internetnz.net.nz/our-work/Openness/Trans-Pacific-Parternship-TPP-agreement" target="_self">internetnz.net.nz/our-work/Openness/Trans-Pacific-Parternship-TPP-agreement</a>)
and other countries into matching the US's
Hollywood-driven and freedom-hostile intellectual property laws. So I urge
you to pay attention to that one, while here we look instead at the freedom
found in general-purpose computing. This is perhaps the most important
issue, and also the hardest one to explain.
</p><p>
General-purpose computing was born out of IBM's original PC, which arrived
in 1982. That machine itself was not free and open, but its BIOS could be
reverse-engineered, which Phoenix Technologies did in 1993, making possible
the manufacture of &ldquo;IBM-compatible&rdquo; PCs, better known at the time as
clones, by anybody. Succeeding generations of PCs mostly ran Microsoft's
operating systems. But they didn't need to. That was what made Linux and
countless other operating systems possible. <span   class="emphasis"><em>General-purpose computers don't
depend on any one company's controlling technology.</em></span>
</p><p>
General-purpose communications are the same. We aren't locked into anybody
or anything. This is the miracle of the Internet. We don't need a phone
company to make the connection for us. We don't need a license to use it.
We have a choice of many services and paths. We have open protocols for
file transfer, for e-mail and for much else. For specialized
communications, such as that provided by Skype, there are many choices, and
opportunities for many more. But none excludes any other.
</p><p>
The latest threat to general-purpose computing is UEFI, the Unified
Extensible Firmware Interface. Intended as a security measure, it adds a
layer of complication to running an operating system other than
preinstalled Windows on otherwise generic PC hardware. To make installs
easy, Fedora has elected to pay what Cory Doctorow calls &ldquo;blood
money&rdquo; to
make booting a non-hassle
(<a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/07/06/zareason-a-computer-company-w.html#more-169692" target="_self">boingboing.net/2012/07/06/zareason-a-computer-company-w.html#more-169692</a>). (Go to Implementing UEFI Secure Boot in Fedora
for the details at <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/12368.html" target="_self">mjg59.dreamwidth.org/12368.html</a>. It won't give you warm fuzzies.) The direction this
development points is toward less general purposefulness. And this isn't
good.
</p><p>
One of the best characterizations of the Internet I've ever heard was
&ldquo;a
way, not a place&rdquo;, which was the title and key point of a speech Phil
Windley gave at a conference earlier this year. (He makes the same point in
this post: <a href="http://www.windley.com/archives/2012/03/ways_not_places.shtml" target="_self">www.windley.com/archives/2012/03/ways_not_places.shtml</a>.) A protocol is a <span   class="emphasis"><em>way</em></span>. And thus, so is the Internet. We may
talk about spaces, domains, locations, sites and addresses, all of which
frame the Net as real estate. But TCP/IP is a way, not a place. All it does
is make a best effort to connect any two end points by any means possible.
Its purpose could not be more general.
</p><p>
Back in 1997, a hacker (presumably) with the (very pre-Twitter) handle @Man
put up a page titled &ldquo;Attention, Fat Corporate Bastards!&rdquo; It lasted until
2010, but can still be found in the Internet Archive
(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970607134127/http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~atman/attention-fat-bastards.html" target="_self">web.archive.org/web/19970607134127/http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~atman/attention-fat-bastards.html</a>). After yelling about
freedom for most of the page, he treats the reader to a passage that rings
as true today as it did 14 years ago:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
You almost certainly think of the Internet as an audience of some
type&mdash;perhaps somewhat captive. If you actually had even the faintest
glimmering of what reality on the net is like, you'd realize that the real
unit of currency isn't dollars, data, or digicash. It's reputation and
respect. Think about how that impacts your corporate strategy. Think about
how you'd feel if a guy sat down at your lunch table one afternoon when you
were interviewing an applicant for a vice-president's position and tried to
sell the two of you a car, and wouldn't go away. Believe it or not, what
you want to do with the Internet is very similar. Just as you have a
reasonable expectation of privacy and respect when you're at a table for
two in a public place, so too do the users of the Internet have a
reasonable expectation of privacy and respect. When you think of the
Internet, don't think of Mack trucks full of widgets destined for
distributorships, whizzing by countless billboards. Think of a table for
two.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
What could be more general-purpose than a table? Or easier to explain?
</p><p>
Computers are complicated when you look inside them. So are communications.
But their purposes are general, which makes them simple. Nobody needs a
license to build or operate a table. In explaining freedom, maybe it's best
to start there. For everybody's sake.
