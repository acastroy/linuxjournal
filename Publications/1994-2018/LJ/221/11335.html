Perform powerful statistical analysis by embedding the R language in
PostgreSQL.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b9580.0x12b1358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I took two introductory statistics classes in graduate school and
found that I really liked the subject. It wasn't always intuitive,
but it always was interesting, and it really helped me to put research,
polling and many newspaper stories in a new light. I don't do
statistical analysis every day, but it's a powerful tool for
organizing and working with large sets of data, and for finding
correlations among seemingly disparate pieces of information.
</p><p>
For the courses I took, my university told me to buy SPSS, a
commercial program that helps you perform statistical calculations.
Being an open-source kind of guy, I discovered R&mdash;a programming
language aimed at helping people solve problems involving calculations
and statistics. R is a full-fledged language, and it theoretically can be
used in a wide variety of situations. But, it was designed primarily
for use in mathematics and statistical work, and that's where it
really shines.
</p><p>
I managed to get through the class just fine using R instead of SPSS.
The quality of R's documentation and the intuitive feel of the
language, especially for someone experienced with Ruby and Python,
meant that when my instructors demonstrated how to do something in
SPSS, I managed to find the appropriate parallel in R, and even get a
result before they had finished their explanation.
</p><p>
I have continued to use R during the past few years, both as I've
progressed with my dissertation research and even on some client
projects. I've used R to analyze data from text files (typically in
CSV format), and I've used R to analyze data from databases, using the
client packages available for various databases.
</p><p>
Perhaps the most intriguing place I've recently seen R, and where
I've started to experiment with it in my own work, is inside
PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL, long my favorite relational database, has for
many years allowed for the creation of user-defined functions, similar
to &ldquo;stored procedures&rdquo; in other databases. Whereas most databases
provide a single language in which people can write their functions,
PostgreSQL makes it possible to connect nearly any language to the
database. By default, PostgreSQL lets you write server-side functions
in Pl/PgSQL, and there long has been support for Pl/Perl and
Pl/Python.
</p><p>
Since 2003, developer Joe Conway has maintained PL/R, allowing you to
write server-side functions in PostgreSQL, using R. If you ever
have used R, the possibility of using such a powerful statistics
package inside your database should seem like a natural and
powerful combination. Rather than having to read the data into R
outside PostgreSQL, you suddenly can have R work directly on the
results of queries, without needing to use a separate client
application or process.
</p><p>
In this article, I introduce the basics of PL/R. This combination isn't
for everyone, but with the growing (and welcome) popularity of
PostgreSQL among Web developers, and with the increasing need for
analysis of information gathered from Web users, it seems to me
that PL/R could be an important tool for many developers.

Introduction to R</h2></div></div><p>
The home page for R is <a href="http://r-project.org" target="_self">r-project.org</a>. From that site, you can
download versions of R for a variety of operating systems, including
Linux. (I was able to install R on my server running Ubuntu with
<tt  >apt-get install r-base-core</tt>, which installed a large number of
dependent packages.) New versions of R come out every few months and
normally are installed in two versions: the R language and
environment and the runtime necessary to execute programs written in
R, known as &ldquo;Rscript&rdquo;. To use the language interactively,
just type <tt  >R</tt>
at the shell prompt.
</p><p>
R is an interpreted, dynamic language. It has some object-oriented
features as well. At the core of R is the vector data type, which can
contain any number of elements of the same type (known as
&ldquo;mode&rdquo;
within R). Even items that are seemingly scalar values actually
are vectors of length 1. Thus, you don't really have integers in R, but
rather one-element vectors of type integer. You can create
multi-element vectors with the c() function, handing it the values
you would like it to contain:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; c(1,5,9,3)
[1] 1 5 9 3
</pre>
</p><p>
This returns a vector, but now the value is lost. If you want to
capture it, you must do so in a variable, using the assignment operator
&lt;-:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt; x &lt;- c(1,5,9,3)

</pre>
</p><p>
Note that &lt;- is the standard assignment operator in R. You can, in
many places, use the more traditional = operator instead, but it is
frequently recommended in the documentation that you use &lt;- to avoid
problems in certain circumstances. (I must admit, I've never
experienced any problems, although I do try to use &lt;- whenever
possible.)
</p><p>
The beauty of a vector is that mathematical operators are applied to
all of its elements. Thus:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt; x + 5
[1]  6 10 14  8

&gt; x * 3.5
[1]  3.5 17.5 31.5 10.5

&gt; y &lt;- x * 8.6
&gt; y
[1]  8.6 43.0 77.4 25.8

</pre>
</p><p>
If you're wondering what the <tt  >[1]</tt> means on the left side of the vector
output, that's an indication of the starting index of the data you're
looking at. R, like FORTRAN, but unlike most other languages I use,
uses 1 as the index of the first element of an array. Thus, if I want
to retrieve the value 43 from y, I need to use index 2:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; y[2]
[1] 43
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that retrieving the element at index 2 doesn't give me a scalar
value, but rather a one-element vector.
</p><p>
Vectors are nice, but they can hold only one data type at a time.
Because R is dynamically typed, it cannot stop you from entering
inappropriate values. Rather, it'll cast all of the values to the
best possible common type, if they're different. So if you say:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt; x &lt;- c(1,2,"abc",3)
&gt; x
[1] "1"   "2"   "abc" "3"

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b9580.0x12b1eb0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
notice how all the values in this vector have been turned into
strings, in order to ensure that the vector's mode is of type
&ldquo;character&rdquo;.
</p><p>
R allows you to create multidimensional vectors, known as matrices.
To create a matrix, just invoke the matrix() function, giving it a
vector as a first parameter and either the <tt  >nrow</tt> parameter or the
<tt  >ncol</tt> parameter:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt; m &lt;- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow=2)
&gt; m
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    1    3    5
[2,]    2    4    6

</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to grab the first column&mdash;a vector, of course&mdash;you can
do so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; m[,1]
[1] 1 2
</pre>
</p><p>
You also can grab the second row:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; m[2,]
[1] 2 4 6
</pre>
</p><p>
Similar to a matrix, but containing vectors of different types, is a
&ldquo;data frame&rdquo;. When you create a data frame, you assign a name (given as
the parameter name) to a vector. The vectors then are displayed in
parallel, such that index 2 in each vector can be read across, much
like a spreadsheet or database table. For example:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt; names &lt;- c('tom', 'dick', 'harry')
&gt; scores &lt;- c(90, 60, 99)
&gt; height &lt;- c(180, 160, 190)
&gt; d &lt;- data.frame(names=names, scores=scores, height=height)
&gt; d
  names scores height
1   tom     90    180
2  dick     60    160
3 harry     99    190

</pre>
</p><p>
You can think of a data frame as almost a database table. Not
surprisingly, when you execute a PL/R function inside of PostgreSQL, you
can retrieve the contents of a table into a data frame and then
manipulate it.
</p><p>
Now, in this example, you can see that the scores of the three students
would appear to be correlated with their heights&mdash;such that the
taller the student, the higher their score. One of the first things
you learn in statistics, of course, is that correlation doesn't imply
causality, so I should note that I'm definitely not trying to say
taller people are smarter! But you can find, at least in our data
sample here, a correlation between height and score. This is the sort
of thing that R does, and does very well. The easiest way to find the
correlation is to run a simple regression&mdash;meaning, to find the best
possible line that will connect these dots, if &ldquo;height&rdquo; is the
independent (x) variable and &ldquo;scores&rdquo; is the dependent (y) variable.
In R, you would express this as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; lm( scores ~ height, data=d)

Call:
lm(formula = scores ~ height, data = d)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)       height
   -151.714        1.329
</pre>
</p><p>
You can do even better than this though. You can assign the output of
your call to lm() into a variable. This variable, like everything in
R, will then be an object on which you can perform additional
calculations:

<pre     class="programlisting">

score.lm &lt;- lm( scores ~ height, data=d)

</pre>
</p><p>
This object contains the information you need to know in order to
predict people's scores based on their heights (assuming there
is a correlation, of course, which I'm not at all claiming there is,
outside of this contrived example). You then can do this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

&gt; intercept &lt;- coefficients(score.lm)[1]
&gt; slope &lt;- coefficients(score.lm)[2]

&gt; new.student.height &lt;- 157
&gt; predicted.score &lt;- intercept + (slope * new.student.height)
&gt; predicted.score
(Intercept)
   56.87143

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, if you're trying to predict test scores based on student height,
you're likely to be disappointed. But, perhaps you're trying to
predict other things&mdash;for example, the number of pages people
will click on if they came from a particular search keyword, or the
likelihood users will purchase something from you, if they
initially came to your site during lunch hour rather than at night.
These are the simplest sorts of questions you can try to answer
with a statistical regression, and as you begin to work with such
data, you see more and more opportunities for analysis.
</p><p>
Now, it's possible to do this analysis in many different ways. Google
Analytics is a highly popular (and powerful) platform for making
certain correlations. And, of course, you always can dump your
database into CSV format and then read it into R or another package
for analysis. But what PL/R lets you do is run all of this analysis
on your database itself, with a language (unlike Pl/PgSQL) that is
optimized for fast mathematical analysis.
</p><p>
One of the most important parts of R is CRAN, an analog to Perl's
CPAN, Python's PyPi and Ruby Gems&mdash;an extensive set of open-source
packages on a wide variety of subjects, which implement functionality
you might well want to use. For example, my dissertation
research involves understanding what sorts of social networks were
created among users of the software I created; using a CRAN project
called statnet, such analysis becomes relatively easy to do.

Installing PL/R</h2></div></div><p>
Installing PL/R is possibly the hardest part of working with PL/R,
although it has gotten significantly easier since the creation of the
&ldquo;extension&rdquo; system in PostgreSQL. First, make sure you have
installed the latest versions of both R and PostgreSQL. Earlier
versions will work, but particularly in the case of PostgreSQL, a
modern version will be better, thanks to the extension system. I
assume in this article that you are using PostgreSQL 9.1.
</p><p>
Now, you need to set the R_HOME environment variable. This variable
will tell the PL/R compilation and extension mechanism where to find
R's header and library files. On my Ubuntu server, after installing R
via apt-get, I set R_HOME to /usr/share/R:

<pre     class="programlisting">
export R_HOME=/usr/share/R
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you've set that up, you can download the PL/R source code. At the
time of 
this writing, the latest version is 8.3.0 and is available from the
PL/R home page. Then, as the instructions indicate, go into the plr
directory that results from opening the .tar.gz, and type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
USE_PGXS=1 make
USE_PGXS=1 make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that this doesn't install PL/R into any of your PostgreSQL
databases. Rather, it makes the PL/R extension available, such that
you then can create the PL/R extension inside any database that would
like to benefit from it.
</p><p>
After installing the extension, I went into my personal PostgreSQL
database (named &ldquo;reuven&rdquo;, same as my user name) and invoked:

<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT * from pg_available_extensions;
</pre>
</p><p>
I could tell that the extension had been installed correctly, because
one of the output rows from this query contained
<tt  >plr</tt>. Thus, I was 
able to install it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE EXTENSION plr;
</pre>
</p><p>
PostgreSQL responded with <tt  >CREATE EXTENSION</tt>, meaning that the query
was successful.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11b9580.0x16ab180"></a>
Using PL/R</h2></div></div><p>
Now that PL/R has been installed, what can you do with it? Since you
installed it for the purpose of writing functions, the natural thing
to do is...write a function. For example, here's a PL/R
function that multiplies two numbers:


<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mult(num1 INTEGER, num2 INTEGER)
RETURNS INTEGER AS
$$
return(num1 * num2);
$$ LANGUAGE plr;
</pre>
</p><p>
If you ever have written a PL/PgSQL function before, you'll
recognize the general outline of the function-creation syntax. But
between the $$ quotation symbols, instead of PL/PgSQL, you instead have
an R function. Because you're not in the normal R environment, you
don't have the normal R function assignment or parameters, and you do
need to specify a return type. But the function works just fine, and
someone using this function doesn't need to know that it was written
in R:

<pre     class="programlisting">
reuven=# select mult(50, 20);
 mult
------
 1000
(1 row)
</pre>
</p><p>
Where PL/R really comes into its own is when you have data that needs
R-type analysis. For example, let's put the same score-height data
into a database table:

<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Students (
name TEXT,
score INTEGER,
height INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO Students (name, score, height)
     VALUES ('tom', 90, 180),
            ('dick', 60, 160),
            ('harry', 99, 190);
</pre>
</p><p>
If you can get this data from a PostgreSQL table into an R data frame,
you can perform a regression on the data, returning the slope of
the intercept line:


<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION score_height_slope() RETURNS TEXT AS
$$
    students &lt;- pg.spi.exec("select name, score, height FROM
    &#8618;students");
    score.lm &lt;- lm(score ~ height, data=students);
    return(score.lm[[2]]);
$$ LANGUAGE PLR;
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, note that in this case, you're not running a
regression directly on the data in the table. Rather, the table data
is read into R, which creates a data frame, on which you run the
regression. However, the ease with which you can do this, and the way
in which the SQL query (using the pg.spi.exec function) can retrieve
database information and stick it in a data frame, makes all the
difference. If retrieving all of the data in one fell swoop would be
a problem, you might prefer to use PL/R's other implementations
of the SPI (server programming interface) API for PostgreSQL,
including support for working with cursors.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
PL/R is one of those ideas I never would have understood if I had
encountered it years ago, but now, given my exposure to (and use of)
statistics, there are many ways I can foresee using it.
There are some limitations; PL/R functions cannot easily call other
PL/R functions, and data types don't always match up as you might
expect with their PostgreSQL counterparts. But PL/R offers support
for such advanced PostgreSQL features as aggregates and window
functions, allowing you to produce all sorts of sophisticated reports
and analysis.
