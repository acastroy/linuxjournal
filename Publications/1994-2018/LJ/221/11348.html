Don't let DNS get you into a BIND; read on to sort out port 53.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f4358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In this article, I cover DNS, arguably the most &ldquo;Rube
Goldberg&rdquo; of all
services. (Well, except for Sendmail, but that's really just one
application, not an entire service.) DNS (Domain Name Services)
quite simply maps domain names to IP addresses. For some reason, it's
easier for humans to remember words than strings of numbers, so rather
than remembering 12.34.56.78, we remember www.linuxjournal.com.
</p><p>
Using DNS instead of remembering IP addresses not only helps prove Linux
users aren't really cyborgs, it also allows some pretty cool magic in the
server department. Instead of one server per Web site, a single server
with a single IP address can host multiple Web sites. Unfortunately,
the way DNS works on a global scale means it's not without its faults
and frustrations. G.I. Joe always said, &ldquo;knowing is half the
battle&rdquo;,
so in this article, I walk you through being a knowledgeable DNS user,
without ever delving into the complexities of the underlying system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f45c0"></a>
The Un-DNS</h2></div></div><p>
For most Linux distributions, you configure &ldquo;how&rdquo; the computer looks up
URLs by setting the options in /etc/nsswitch.conf. If you look at your
nsswitch.conf file, you'll probably find the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
hosts: files dns
</pre>
</p><p>
This line tells the computer that before it asks its DNS server for
the IP address, it should look into its /etc/hosts file for a domain
mapping. By default, there probably is a line defining the localhost
address and possibly an entry defining whatever hostname and IP you
set for the computer. This file has the following format:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# IP Address                Domain Name
127.0.0.1                   localhost
192.168.1.1                 router
192.168.1.10                homeserver
192.168.1.20                xbmc
</pre>
</p><p>
Once entered into the file, you can use the names defined in place of
an IP address. This is truly domain name resolution in its simplest
form. If you need only to map an address for your local computer,
this is the ideal way to configure your computer. Keep in mind that the
order specified in nsswitch.conf is the order your computer will search,
so if you put an entry like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
192.168.1.20                www.google.com
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f48d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
it won't ever look up the proper address for Google. It will query the
server at 192.168.1.20 as if it were www.google.com. This is a feature
rather than a bug. Although it certainly allows for some easy pranking
(you didn't hear that from me), it also can be used to block specific
sites. If you wanted to block Facebook on your home computer, for example,
you could add:

<pre     class="programlisting">
127.0.0.1                   www.facebook.com
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f4a38"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Then, when the user tries to access Facebook, it will fail. Note that this
is not a foolproof way to block Internet sites, but it works in most
situations. This method often is used to block ads on Web pages. It's
possible to find a list of ad servers and then put the list into your
/etc/hosts file. Again, it's not foolproof, but the logic is sound.
The hosts file is also useful for other purposes too, which I'll come
back to later.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f4b40"></a>
DNSMasq&mdash;the Super Simple Server</h2></div></div><p>
If you're using an off-the-shelf router for your home network, chances
are it's running DNSMasq as a DNS server. DNSMasq is a DNS forwarder
that queries a remote DNS server and returns the value to the client
requesting the information. It has the handy feature of querying the
router's /etc/hosts file first, and most routers have a way to add DNS
entries. It's not always simple, like the case of DD-WRT. In order to
add an address to the DNSMasq server on DD-WRT, you need to add lines
to the DNSMasq config section like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
address=/homeserver/192.168.1.10
address=/xbmc/192.168.1.20
</pre>
</p><p>
See Figure 1 for a DD-WRT screenshot. By adding addresses to your router's
DNSMasq server, you effectively can make an /etc/hosts file for every
computer on your network. DNSMasq also is tied into the DHCP server,
allowing for automatic mapping of hostnames to DHCP assignments,
but that's a bit outside the scope of this column.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11348f1.large.jpg"><img src="11348f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. DD-WRT allows you to add DNS entries, but it's not terribly
user-friendly.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f4eb0"></a>
Getting into a BIND</h2></div></div><p>
When it comes to DNS on the greater Internet, BIND is the de facto standard
server. Unfortunately, BIND also is where the vast complexities of the
Domain Naming System come into play. Don't get me wrong, the complexities
aren't frivolous, just frustrating at times. If you are managing a DNS
server for a business, chances are you need to work with BIND. Because BIND
supports every facet of the DNS concept, I think it's important for a
little terminology lesson before we dig into configuration. 
See the sidebar for some DNS terms you should be familiar with before delving into
BIND configuration.

</p><p>
First off, if you're going to configure BIND, I recommend using a tool
like Webmin for your first time. There are some quirks when you edit
the BIND configuration file that aren't apparent at first. For example,
when you edit a zone file (usually stored in /var/named), you need to
increment the serial number at the top, or other servers won't see your
information as the most recent.
</p><p>
Assuming your zone files are created, it's fairly easy to see how to
add or modify records. The only thing I'll specifically mention here about
the zone file is the TTL setting. This setting tells clients how many
seconds the domain information is &ldquo;good&rdquo; for. If you plan to change Web
hosts, it's good practice to set this TTL setting to something low about a
week before the change, so when you do make the change, propagation time
across the Internet goes much more quickly. Some DNS hosting companies
set this to DAYS by default, so your well-planned host migration could
take a week to propagate instead of a couple hours.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f5170"></a>
Tools of the Trade</h2></div></div><p>
Although messing with the DNS servers is how you adjust settings, testing
them isn't as straightforward as you might think. If you change a setting
on one server, it takes a while to propagate to other servers, so testing
can be frustrating. Thankfully, it's not hard to query specific servers.
</p><p>
For years, nslookup was the tool for doing DNS lookups. For some reason,
several years ago, nslookup became deprecated, and no one bothered to
tell me about it. I'm telling you now, so you don't look foolish trying
to use nslookup on your machine. The new dog in town is the dig
command, and it's pretty cool.
</p><p>
Issuing the dig command on its own will query whatever DNS server is
assigned to your system. So typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dig www.linuxjournal.com
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f53d8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
will yield something like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

spowers@server:~$ dig www.linuxjournal.com

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.1-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; www.linuxjournal.com
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 50038
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:

;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 54

</pre>
</p><p>
You'll notice at the bottom that the server responding is my local router
at 192.168.1.1. If I want to query a different DNS server, however,
it's as easy as typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dig @8.8.8.8 www.linuxjournal.com
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f5640"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which gives this:


<pre     class="programlisting">

spowers@server:~$ dig @8.8.8.8 www.linuxjournal.com

; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.8.1-P1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; @8.8.8.8 www.linuxjournal.com
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd

</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that the response is the same, but at the bottom you can see the server
I queried was 8.8.8.8 (Google's public DNS server, which is terribly
easy to remember).
</p><p>
One important thing to note is that the dig command will
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> honor entries
in your /etc/hosts file. It's strictly a DNS lookup tool, so it only knows
to query servers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f5900"></a>
Some Cool DNS Tricks</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have at least a loose understanding of how DNS works,
I want to share a few of the really nifty things you can do with it in
your network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f5a08"></a>
Rudimentary Load Balancing</h2></div></div><p>
Simply by adding multiple A Records for a single domain, it's possible
to create a load-balancing situation for your servers. The BIND server
will respond to queries in a round-robin fashion when there are multiple A
Records. If you have a service you'd like to split across servers without
configuring actual load balancing, round-robin DNS is a viable solution.
</p><p>
It's important to keep in mind that this solution has several failings. It
doesn't actually load balance, it just alternates DNS responses. So, luck
of the draw might mean one server is far busier than another. Round-robin DNS also breaks reverse lookups. If your application requires
reverse DNS to function, a round-robin scenario will not work. Also,
with a low TTL, constantly changing IP information likely will have an
adverse effect on most services.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27f5bc0"></a>
Split DNS</h2></div></div><p>
I touched on this concept earlier with regard to putting false
entries in the /etc/hosts file. It's sometimes called &ldquo;fake
DNS&rdquo; or
&ldquo;DNS hijacking&rdquo; or any of several nefarious-sounding titles.
Basically,
the concept is that you host a zone locally and declare yourself
authoritative for your clients. Because you've told your BIND server it
was authoritative for a zone, it will serve only the IP information
you configure and not query the greater Internet for actual IP
mapping. This is very useful if you want to map internal domain names
to private IPs. This is also useful if you want certain domains (like
intranet.example.com) to exist only inside your company and not even
resolve from the Internet.
</p><p>
It's important to note that this is a hack of the protocol and can
have its failings too. In fact, some routers will detect split DNS as
a DNS-spoofing attack (which technically it is) and not allow you to
use those false addresses.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27ec660"></a>
Virtual Domains</h2></div></div><p>
This isn't a hack at all, but rather a feature of most Web servers. Because
the number of Web sites far surpasses the number of available IP addresses,
Web servers now allow separate Web sites using the same IP address.
For example, let's say three friends share a server. The DNS entries for
their blogs might be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
12.34.56.78   shawnblog.example.com
12.34.56.78   julieblog.example.com
12.34.56.78   frankblog.example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll notice the three different domains share the same IP address. If you
try to access http://12.34.56.78, the Web server won't know whose blog
you're trying to access. By configuring virtual domains, however, the
Web server running at 12.34.56.78 can differentiate between the blogs by
which address you are querying. So http://shawnblog.example.com will
get one Web site, and http://julieblog.example.com will get an entirely
different one.
</p><p>
This ability for DNS entries to share a common IP address and Web
servers to serve pages based on which domain name was requested has
allowed for the modern Internet to work. Without that feature, shared
hosting wouldn't be possible.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27ec870"></a>
Virtual Hosting for One</h2></div></div><p>
While Internet Web hosting relies on virtual hosts for most sites, a Web
developer or sysadmin often can become frustrated waiting for propagation
time when a DNS change is made. Let's say you've created a fancy new
Web site on a new Web server, and you want to make sure it's working once
the DNS change propagates through the Internet. Since Web servers 
reply based only on the domain request they receive, until DNS propagates,
it's impossible to make sure the new Web site is working.
</p><p>
Thankfully, the Web server itself doesn't do DNS lookups; it knows
only the domain names it's supposed to respond for. If you change your local
/etc/hosts file with the new DNS information <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> you make the
change on the Internet, you can test your new server using your local
DNS information. In fact, without the ability to make this local bogus
DNS change, testing your new server would be close to impossible!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27eca28"></a>
At the End of the Day</h2></div></div><p>
DNS is a complex system of root servers, zone transfers, propagation time
and reverse lookups. As you can see, however, it does a lot more than just
map names to IP addresses. Without DNS, the Internet would be a lot less
useful, and company Web sites would be far more difficult to remember.
(&ldquo;Come check us out at http://224.143.77.155 !!&rdquo; doesn't really roll off
the tongue very well.)
</p><p>
By using DNS on your local network, you can save a lot of time and make
future changes far less painful. If BIND overwhelms you, don't let that
bother you too much. You certainly don't have to be an expert on zone
transfers in order to grasp DNS. The easiest way to start is to play with
your /etc/hosts file. Playing with someone <span   class="emphasis"><em>else's</em></span> /etc/hosts file 
also can be fun, but be sure to use your super powers only for good!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26fc580.0x27ecc38"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Common DNS Terms</b></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A Record (Address Record): this type of record directly maps a name
to an IP address. Originally, no two A Records were supposed to point
to the same IP address. (This is no longer practical, but is considered
&ldquo;best practice&rdquo; where appropriate.)
</p></li><li><p>
Authoritative: a server is considered authoritative when it is hosting
the domain in question itself rather than querying another server for
the information. A server is considered authoritative by domain; it's
not a boolean server setting like with DHCP. The same server can be
authoritative for one domain, and not for another.
</p></li><li><p>
BIND (Berkeley Internet Name D&aelig;mon): the most common DNS server on
the Internet.
</p></li><li><p>
Caching (or Namecaching): locally stored copy of name resolution from
an authoritative DNS server. The caching duration is based on the TTL
settings from the authoritative server (see TTL below).
</p></li><li><p>
CNAME (Canonical Name Record): this creates an alias to another DNS
entry that inherits the properties of the original.
</p></li><li><p>
Forward Zone: a &ldquo;zone&rdquo; is used to define the section of DNS space a
server is responsible for mapping names to IP addresses.
</p></li><li><p>
Reverse Zone: a DNS server also can supply reverse lookups, mapping
names to queried IP addresses. This often is used for security to verify
DNS information.
</p></li><li><p>
FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name): this is the entire DNS name, including
a period at the end.
</p></li><li><p>
MX Record (Mail Exchange Record): this specifies a mail route
for a particular domain. Multiple MX Records are possible (and
recommended!) with priority levels.
</p></li><li><p>
NS Record: declares what server serves a given zone. This is where the
server would declare itself authoritative for a particular zone.
</p></li><li><p>
PTR Record (Pointer Record): a PTR record often is called the reverse
record, and it associates an IP address with a domain name.
</p></li><li><p>
Propagation: the period of time between when a DNS change is made on
the authoritative server and the time all servers on the Internet have
current information. This propagation time can be several hours or
several days depending on the TTL settings for a particular record.
</p></li><li><p>
Root Server: there currently are 13 root servers on the Internet, which
host the top-level domains. Through very complex routing and redundancy,
these servers are all over the globe and are placed with fault tolerance
in mind.
</p></li><li><p>
SOA Record (Start of Authority Record): the first record in a zone file,
containing information about the zone itself, including whether or not
the server is authoritative.
</p></li><li><p>
SRV Record (Service Record): provides information about what services
are available for a domain.
</p></li><li><p>
Top-Level Domain: any zone hosted by the 13 root servers. These are
domains like com, edu, org, gov and country codes like us, ca and uk.
</p></li><li><p>
TTL (Time To Live): this is a number set by the authoritative server for
a domain that tells DNS servers how long to cache information before
querying again.
