Ever wished you could have a house full of music, but afraid to commit to a
proprietary platform? The Logitech Squeezebox is an open platform for
streaming music all throughout your house and beyond. And, it runs Linux too.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294c2a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
There's no shortage of options for playing music under Linux. Whether
it's local media players, cloud-based music services or streaming
music, Linux users are spoiled for choice. But the number of choices
diminishes rapidly when you add features like multiroom playback,
or add multiplatform support for Windows, Macintosh and smartphones
like Android and iPhone. Platforms like Apple's iTunes support multiple
devices via Air Play, but Linux machines can't support Air Play without
major effort and hacked-up solutions. Logitech's Squeezebox not only
comprises a reasonably priced hardware platform, it also supports several
operating systems for both playback and server-side usage. The newer
Squeezebox devices (such as the Squeezebox Radio and Squeezebox Touch)
run on embedded Linux platforms. The Squeezebox server and devices
support most major, non-DRM-encumbered formats (including MP3, FLAC and
OGG) and support many on-line streaming services, such as Spotify, Pandora,
Last.fm and SiriusXM. Logitech also supports an active Squeezebox hacker
community and makes the source of both the player and the server freely
available.

Logitech's Squeezebox platform is the perfect solution for my listening
needs. I use the Squeezebox every chance I can, streaming music from
my home machine to my workstation at work via an SSH tunnel. Add a long
history of quality hardware devices and an open platform, and you have a
compelling reason for every Linux user to consider using the Squeezebox
Platform. By the end of this article, you'll wonder why you haven't set
up a Squeezebox platform of your own, and once you have, you'll wonder
why you didn't do it sooner. That's okay, though; there's never been a
better time to start.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294c670"></a>
Brief History</h2></div></div><p>
The Logitech Squeezebox player has a long history of development. It
started back in 2000 with the formation of Slim Devices. Slim Devices
released its first music player, the SLiMP3, in 2001. It was a
wired-only device, capable of playing MP3-only streams. It relied
heavily on the Slim Server to perform transcoding duties for other
formats. Later, Slim Devices released wireless versions of the SLiMP3
with enhanced displays and support for other formats, such as OGG,
WAV, AAC and WMA. The first of these models, the Squeezebox1 (or SB1)
supports only WEP over 802.11b, so it's more useful on today's networks
via a wired connection. The Squeezebox2 (SB2) adds both WPA encryption,
802.11g wireless communication and native FLAC support. If I were looking
for an older Squeezebox unit, the SB2 has the base feature set I would
want for any Squeezebox unit. The SB3 (initially named the Squeezebox,
later re-named the Squeezebox Classic) is essentially the SB2 with a
different case design. Every one of these devices still is supported by
the Slim Server (now Logitech Media Server), so if you find one in the
wild, be sure to pick it up!
</p><p>
In 2006, Logitech acquired Slim Devices and continues supporting the
Squeezebox line with frequent software releases, and with newer hardware
to refresh the Squeezebox line. Logitech released the Squeezebox Boom,
the first all-in-one Squeezebox device that included stereo speakers,
and used the same interface as the Squeezebox Classic. Logitech also
released the Squeezebox Duet, which bundled the Squeezebox Receiver (a
headless device capable of playing Squeezebox streams) together with the
Squeezebox Controller (a remote-control device capable of controlling any
Squeezebox or Transporter device). Both the Boom and Duet have since been
discontinued, but the Squeezebox Controller is notable as it was the first
device to ship with the new Linux-based SqueezeOS operating system and
the Lua-based SqueezePlay interface. Logitech released other Linux-based
hardware devices: the Squeezebox Radio and the Squeezebox Touch (which
I discuss later in this article). Logitech also sells the Transporter,
which is geared toward the audiophile market. The Transporter uses two
fluorescent displays (similar to those used in the Squeezebox Classic),
and includes upgraded, audiophile-quality hardware (See the Logitech
Transporter sidebar). At the
time
of this writing, the Transporter, Squeezebox Radio and Squeezebox
Touch are the only hardware players sold by Logitech.
</p><p>
Okay, enough history. Let's get something set up so you can start playing music!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294c828"></a>
Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
You'll need both a Logitech Media Server and one or more Squeezebox
clients to make use of the Squeezebox platform. Fortunately, you
won't need to make a trip to the store, as both the server and clients
are freely available on-line. The server software is available from
<a href="http://www.mysqeueezebox.com/download" target="_self">www.mysqeueezebox.com/download</a> in prepackaged RPM or .deb
formats, or as a tarball of Perl source code. The server software does
not require a mysqueezebox.com account, but I recommend signing up
for one, as some proprietary music services will not work without a
mysqueezebox.com account. mysqueezebox.com also will able to act as a
Squeezebox server should you be unable (or unwilling) to connect to a
local server.
</p><p>
Follow the installation instructions for your platform to install
the Logitech Squeezebox server. Once you have it installed, navigate
to your server's address, port 9000 (for this article, I'll use
http://localhost:9000 as the server URL). Enter your mysqueezebox.com
credentials (if you have them), and click Next to continue (or
Skip). Next, select where your music is located on the server and where
to store playlists. Once those are selected, your server is active.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294c9e0"></a>
Server</h2></div></div><p>
Let me talk a bit about the Media Server. The Media Server is the brains
of the Squeezebox platform. The server acts as the repository for files
and playlists, as well as a Web-based controller for all of the connected
Squeezebox devices. Most functions and options available on the Squeezebox
players can be performed using the Squeezebox server. The server has
a bunch of settings for setting various functions of the connected
Squeezebox devices. One of those that I use determines the quality of
output to the Squeezebox devices. I have a work Squeezebox client that
I don't want to deliver full-sized FLAC files to, so I tell the Media
Server to transcode those files to 160Kbps MP3 files before sending them
to my client. There are way too many settings to cover in this article,
but suffice it to say that there are a bunch of ways to configure the server and
clients. The Media Server also is extensible using a variety of plugins
and applications, which can customize the Logitech Media Server to fit
your music listening needs.

Synchronicity</b></p><p>
Because the Squeezebox keeps a running tab on each of the players currently
playing, it makes it very easy to see what a particular player is playing.
But,
what's even cooler is syncing several players together. Navigate to the player
drop-down list to select the player you want to start with. Next, select the
player drop-down list, and select Synchronize.... The server will show a list
of current players. Select the player you want to sync with, and get ready to
hear music in both rooms at the same time. (If you notice they're not
perfectly in sync,
don't worry; there are plenty of options on the server to take care of
most synchronizing issues.) Let the Squeezebox pipe music throughout
your house at your next party!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294d068"></a>
Current Hardware Players</h2></div></div><p>
Logitech currently sells three hardware Squeezebox clients: the Squeezebox
Radio, the Squeezebox Touch and the Transporter. I've personally
used the Squeezebox Radio and Squeezebox Touch, as well as an older
Squeezebox Classic, so I discuss those units in more detail here. Both
the Squeezebox Touch and Squeezebox Radio are ARM-based Linux devices
using a real-time customized Linux distribution called SqueezeOS. User
interactions are handled by SqueezePlay, a Lua-based front end for
interfacing with Squeezebox devices. The Squeezebox Radio features a
single bi-amplified speaker, an 1/8" input jack and an 1/8" headphone
jack. The Radio comes in three different colors: black, red and white
(white is available exclusively from the Logitech on-line store). It's
perfect as a standalone radio (I use my Squeezebox Radio in the bedroom
as a clock-radio and occasionally in the kitchen when doing the dishes).
</p><p>
There are six hardware preset buttons on the Squeezebox Radio, which can be
used for marking Internet Radio stations or other favorite songs. The
interface centers around a jog-dial for selecting menu items and is
pretty intuitive to use. The Squeezebox Touch is also a SqueezeOS-based
ARM device, but it forgoes the speaker in favor of digital and analog
connections. It features both coaxial and optical S/PDIF digital ports,
as well as RCA stereo and 1/8" headphone analog outputs. The Squeezebox
Touch also adds a slot to accept SD card media and a USB port for
external drives or other media. These both allow the Squeezebox Touch to
play audio files without using a server, and also allow the Squeezebox
Touch to act as small Media Server. (Logitech recommends the Squeezebox
Touch serve only a small number of clients and less than 5,000 files, as
it doesn't have the CPU to handle larger amounts.) The Touch interface is
extremely touch-friendly, using swipes to scroll selections of songs, and
featuring an on-screen keyboard for textual input. This gives it a slight
improvement over the jog-dial interface of the Squeezebox Radio. The
Squeezebox Touch also ships with a full-featured remote control with a
directional pad, a numeric pad that handles alphanumeric entry, and other
useful remote functions like volume, favorites and more. The Squeezebox
Radio offers both the remote and an internal battery as options, which
are available via the Squeezebox Radio Accessory Pack. The remote for
the Squeezebox Radio is a reduced-functionality remote compared with the
remote that ships with the Squeezebox Touch (it forgoes the numeric input)
but the Squeezebox remotes are interchangeable.
</p><p>
All of the Squeezebox devices I've tried have great sound. The Squeezebox
Touch has the advantage of more standard connections (especially if you
currently have digital inputs on your receiver) and a very user-friendly
interface. I find the Squeezebox Radio is great for portable applications
(especially with the optional battery), while the Squeezebox Touch fits
perfectly into our home audio system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294d278"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Logitech Transporter</b></p><p>
I haven't covered the Squeezebox Transporter, but suffice it to say that if you have
the budget for a higher-end digital player, this would be the one to look at.
It boasts audiophile components, but uses the older-style Squeezebox client
software (similar to the Squeezebox Classic). It has two
individually addressable fluorescent displays, and it adds two XLR connectors,
infrared in/out jacks, as well as the normal digital and analog connectors.
If you measure your listening environment with
an oscilloscope or are looking for a Squeezebox for a custom
installation, definitely check out the Squeezebox Transporter.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294d488"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
The Spirit of Radio</b></p><p>
The Logitech Media Server ships with a bunch of Internet Streaming and Radio
Services ready for configuration. I was able to set up most of the local radio
stations by just entering my zip code. The Logitech Media Server uses a service
called TuneIn (formerly RadioTime) to determine what local radio stations are
available. Not only was I able to select most area stations, I also was able to find the streaming NOAA Weather Radio station, as well as police and fire
stations. Additionally, I found low-power radio stations that have on-line
streaming, so I can listen to college radio stations that would have required
special a antenna to
receive. And, that's without scratching the surface of the rest of the
world's Internet-available radio stations. It's like having the best of
radio right at home.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294d698"></a>
Software Players</h2></div></div><p>
One of the benefits of the Logitech Squeezebox platform's openness
is the number of software player options available. One of those is
Logitech's own Squeezeplay software. The Squeezeplay software is the same
interface as the Squeezebox Touch or Radio. It is available for Windows,
Macintosh and Linux. Unfortunately, I had little success getting it
to work under my Ubuntu machines, but it worked well under the Windows
system I tested. What works well on my Linux machine is a terminal-based
program called Squeezeslave. Squeezeslave is a C-based program that
emulates the interface of the Squeezebox Classic devices faithfully (it
even requires you to use the numeric keys to enter search text, as if
you were using a remote). Squeezeslave boasts excellent sound quality,
and it can be run as a d&aelig;mon so you won't have to dedicate a terminal to
use it.
</p><p>
Another excellent player is the Java-based Soft Squeeze. It is
a more graphically faithful version of the Squeezebox Classic devices,
with a variety of skins (including some that look like the Squeezebox
Transporter, Boom and Classic). Both of these applications fit nicely
with my listening habits, because I can use the same server for both home
and work. I've set up an SSH tunnel at work to ports 9000 and 3483 (the
stream and control ports, respectively) and have access to both my large
library of songs, my list of radio streams via the Squeezebox server
and one of the aforementioned clients (Squeezeslave, primarily). So,
if the mood strikes me to listen to Kendra Springer at work and all I
have on my phone is Death Metal, I can hook up to my Squeezebox server
at home and listen to all the Kendra Springer I want. (Hey, sometimes
it happens!)
</p><p>
In addition, several applications are available for Android, iPhone
and Nokia devices. Logitech's own Squeezebox Controller (available for
both Android and iPhone) acts as a controller for any Squeezebox device
hooked to a server. The menus and interface are similar to the Squeezebox
Touch interface, and it works as you might expect. The third-party
applications are really where the power of the Squeezebox platform is
realized. iPeng (available on the Apple iPhone) acts as a Squeezebox
controller application, but for a few dollars more, you can unlock a
receiver application that turns your iPhone into a portable Squeezebox
receiver. This allows you to control and listen to your Squeezebox music
as far as your network will let you. Android users have the option of
purchasing a separate application to act as a Squeezebox receiver: Squeeze
Player (not to be confused with the Squeezeplay interface). Squeeze Player
only acts as a Squeezebox Receiver, but when paired with the Logitech
Squeezebox controller application, it becomes a very capable remote
player. Android users have the option of using a very-cool third-party
controller application: SqueezeCommander. SqueezeCommander has all of
the functionality of the excellent Logitech Squeezebox application,
but also includes a bunch of features. Most notably is the ability to
download music files available to the Squeezebox directly onto the Android
Device. I find this extremely handy, as I can download my music without
needing to have the phone hooked directly to the computer. Nokia users
have the option of using Squeezester controller, though I'm not aware
of any receiver applications for those devices. There are also similar
Squeezebox receiver and controller projects for XMBC in various stages
of development. Check on-line to see if there's Squeezebox support for
your platform. You may be pleasantly surprised. (And if there isn't,
you'll have all of the tools and documentation to create one).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294d8a8"></a>
Applications and Plugins</h2></div></div><p>
Linux users are usually left to their own hackish solutions whenever it
comes to streaming services like Pandora and Spotify, or for streaming
Sirius XM satellite radio. With the Logitech Squeezebox player,
support for these services (as well as many other Internet-Radio
services like Spotify and Soma.fm) are installable via applications
or plugins. Application installs are handled from your My Squeezebox
account. Select the application you want to install, click install, and
your Media Server will install the application. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11305f4.large.jpg"><img src="11305f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. You can install applications for the Squeezebox Server via
mysqueezebox.com
</p></div></div><p>
The Squeezebox supports
many different music services, as well as Facebook and Flickr. Yes, you
read that right: Flickr. Because the Squeezebox Radio and Squeezebox Touch
sport color LCD screens, you can have them perform a slide-show of Flickr
images on the device. There also are hundreds of plugins available for the
Squeezebox, many of which were written by third-party authors. These cover
a myriad of uses, like adding UPnP/DLNA capabilities to the server,
switching playlists and positions from one player to another, and many
more. There is an active plugin community available, and extensive
documentation for creating plugins inside the Help menu on the server
(Help&rarr;Technical Information&rarr;Logitech Media Server Plugins).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2854580.0x294dbc0"></a>
Peeking Under the Covers</h2></div></div><p>
Logitech and Slim Devices went the extra mile to make the Squeezebox
platform controllable and extensible. The Squeezebox server ships
with a telnet-addressable command-line interface. Telnet to port 9090
of your server, and you can control every aspect of your Squeezebox
server and connected devices. You can learn more about the commands
via the help documentation (Help&rarr;Technical Information&rarr;Command Line
Interface). Better still, all of the SqueezeOS-based players (Squeezebox
Radio, Touch and Duet) have an SSH server built in (which is turned off
by default, but it can be enabled simply by navigating to
Home&rarr;Settings&rarr;Advanced&rarr;Remote Login&rarr;Enable SSH). Once
enabled, <tt  >ssh</tt> to it with the
default credentials (root/1234). Once inside, the best Message Of The
Day (MOTD) I ever have seen is displayed:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
This network device is for authorized use only. Unauthorized or improper use
of this system may result in you hearing very bad music. If you do not consent
to these terms, LOG OFF IMMEDIATELY. 
</p><p>
Ha, only joking. Now that you have logged in feel free to change your root password
using the 'passwd' command. You can safely modify any of the files on this
system. A factory reset (press and hold add on power on) will remove all your
modifications and revert to the installed firmware.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Once you've logged in, you have access to all of the internals of the
Squeezebox device. This is one of the most forward-thinking moves I've
seen from any hardware manufacturer. It came in handy for diagnosing
some trouble I had with alarms on the Squeezebox Radio. (When was the
last time you ran <tt  >tail</tt> on your alarm clock?) Logitech even releases the
source code for SqueezeOS and includes instructions on how to build and
flash the firmware (handy for those of you who never run stock-anything
on your hardware).
</p><p>
If you really want to dig in to the capabilities of the Logitech platform,
the server ships with some of the most comprehensive documentation I
have ever seen for a hardware product. Logitech ships the Media Server
with gorgeous and thorough documentation. Hidden under the normally
useless moniker of &ldquo;Help&rdquo;, Logitech provides a comprehensive pile of
documentation about the internals of the Squeezebox Protocol, how to
create skins for the server, how to create plugins for the Media Server,
the display API, and so much more. There is also documentation for
xPL, which is an automation protocol I learned about while skimming
the documentation. The server can support xPL calls via enabling a
plugin. With some hardware hacking, it's entirely possible to set up
near-field communications with a device that notifies your Media Server
to play &ldquo;The Imperial March&rdquo; from <span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars</em></span> on all of your Squeezebox
devices whenever you come home. (Note: the author takes no responsibility
for the other residents' reactions if you do this.)
</p><p>
I hope this taste of the Squeezebox Platform inspires you at least to download
the server and one of the software clients. I know it has opened up
a world of possibilities for my music listening. Few of the solutions
I've tried boast the interconnectivity of the Squeezebox platform. None
of them come close to the openness and control of the Squeezebox. Using
your phone or Web browser to control every music player in your house is
a liberating experience. Being able to listen to the same collection of
music and radio streams remotely from my home machine is like a dream come
true for me. Having permission to play, tinker and expand the platform
(with excellent documentation and a full open-source stack) is unheard
of in the higher-end audio space. May your exploration of the Logitech
Squeezebox Platform make your listening experience more enjoyable.
