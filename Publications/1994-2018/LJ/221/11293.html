Open, rooted, warranty included&mdash;we take ZaReason's new open tablet, the
ZaTab, for a spin.

Quite a few options exist
as far as Android tablets
go. Some of them are great choices for personal entertainment and media
consumption. Google's new Nexus 7 is a powerful little beast designed to
serve up media from Google Play. Amazon's Kindle Fire is a great device
for tapping Amazon's extensive content offerings. Undoubtedly, these
tablets were designed to direct more of your money to the tablet-maker's
on-line content marketplaces. The glaring lack of SD card expansion on
these devices confirms this. The ZaReason team designed a tablet that can
be what the user wants it to be&mdash;one that supports users' own content,
that is not necessarily tied to a particular content store and
that can be used as far more than a simple consumption device. Have they
succeeded in creating the world's first open tablet? Let's find out.

As you read over the stats, a few things should catch your
attention. First, the ZaTab comes loaded with Cyanogenmod 9, based on
Android 4.04 Ice Cream Sandwich, and is rooted out of the box. I feel
like I need to say that again&mdash;it is rooted out of the box! You can
open a terminal and explore your device with root permissions in
a matter of seconds. There's no need to run an exploit to get root access, no
need to flash another ROM, no voided warranties. Second, there is 16GB
of internal Flash storage for apps and media, and a microSD slot that
can accommodate an additional 32GB of storage. So, there's ample storage for your
content, stored locally, on your device&mdash;no need to rely on &ldquo;the
cloud&rdquo;
or streaming media services.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a4580.0x279d068"></a>
Opening the Box</h2></div></div><p>
The ZaTab arrived packed well inside a corrugated shipping box, with
bubble wrap surrounding the retail box. The retail box is generic OEM
fare. I would love to see ZaReason produce a branded box for the tablet,
but that is another expense and surely would raise the price. Snuggled
in the box under the tablet, you will find a micro-USB-to-USB cable, a
micro-USB-to-female USB adapter for connecting USB-based accessories,
an A/C adapter and a small generic Android manual. The tablet feels
sturdy but not too heavy&mdash;definitely not cheap. Unlike most Android
tablets out there, the casing is not plastic. The back/sides consist of a
solid piece of matte aluminum, with a large ZaReason logo silk-screened on
the back of the unit. The port and button labels also are silk-screened
on the back just below their respective buttons/ports. Along the top
edge, you will find the power button, 5v DC power input, micro-HDMI out,
two micro-USB ports, an 1/8" headphone jack and three small vents
to keep things cool. Along the right edge, you will find a back button,
which takes you to the previous screen in the Android interface, and the
volume up/down buttons. On the back of the ZaTab is a paper-clip-style
recessed physical reset button, the main camera and a small grill
protecting the speaker. The front of the ZaTab is mostly screen with a
1/2" black bezel, with a front-facing camera in the top-right corner.

Android Setup</h2></div></div><p>
If you have used any Android device in the past, the initial setup on
first boot will be familiar. Input your Google credentials, connect
to a network, and you're rolling. You have the option to download and
install previous Android apps you have used on any other synced devices
you may have, and your bookmarks as well if you are a Google Chrome user.
The device ships with a minimal set of Android apps: Apollo Media Player,
Android Web Browser, Calculator, Calendar, Email, Camera, Gallery,
Clock, DSPManager, Movie Studio, People (Address Book), ROM Manager,
Superuser, Terminal Emulator and the Android Settings app. You won't find
any preloaded crapware, no nearly useless game demos and no irremovable
commercial apps. The Google Play store installs upon syncing your Google
account, so you have access to the the largest selection of Android apps
from the start.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a4580.0x279dbc0"></a>
The Apps</h2></div></div><p>
Most of the apps I installed work flawlessly. I've had a blast streaming
TED Talks on the ZaTab with TED's official Android app. The video is
high-quality and plays flawlessly on the ZaTab. Google's Gmail app is
perfect for the tablet with split views for folders and messages.
The generic e-mail app works in much the same way with support for
Exchange, IMAP and POP. The Plume Twitter client is a pleasure to use
on the big screen. Amazon's Kindle app looks great as well with easily
configurable font sizes and text colors from which to choose. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>'s
own app looks good on the ZaTab, with text-mode rendering sharp text. I
was able to connect to my employer's Cisco VPN using Cisco's Anyconnect
for rooted Android devices. Earl, from ZaReason, was kind enough to
provide a tun.ko tun module for the ZaTab when asked in the #zareason
IRC chat room on Freenode. This was necessary for the Anyconnect client
as it uses a tun kernel module to facilitate the VPN connection. Earl
tells me that this module will be preloaded on the ZaTab upon official
release, and it may be shipping on ZaTabs as you read this. 
</p><p>
There were
a few apps that just would not play nice with the ZaTab. Netflix, for
example: the app's interface worked fine but the app would stall when
trying to stream video. Twitter's home-grown client was not available
in the store. It must look for certain &ldquo;approved&rdquo; device profiles and
the ZaTab may not be one of them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a4580.0x2b96020"></a>
The Hardware in Use</h2></div></div><p>
The 9.7" 1024x768 in-plane-switching capacitive touchscreen is bright
with brilliant color and has an insane viewing angle. You can tilt this
thing nearly 90 degrees in any direction and maintain
view-ability. I
find the screen size ideal for a personal touchscreen device. Text is
sharp, of reasonable size, and movies are a joy to watch. 
</p><p>
Both cameras
are unimpressive. Photos taken with the main, rear-facing camera are
grainy and quite dark indoors because there is no flash. The front-facing
camera is adequate for low-resolution video chats, but it is also quite
grainy. 
</p><p>
Battery life on the other hand is fantastic. You can use the
ZaTab heavily all day long without worrying about power. For example,
the day after the ZaTab arrived, after a full charge, I spent lots of
time downloading and installing apps, watching TED videos, listening
to streaming music via Google Music, reading via the Kindle app and
exploring the unit via the terminal emulator. After 15 hours of mostly
continuous use, I had 40% charge remaining.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a4580.0x2b96230"></a>
The Interface</h2></div></div><p>
The ZaTab comfortably runs Android ICS. The animated UI transitions and
elements are smooth, and there is plenty of processing power for most apps
despite the tablet being a single-core unit. Switching apps using the
Recent Applications menu makes multitasking simple. Notifications are
unobtrusive, and apps that are notifying can be opened directly from the
notification widget. Plenty of informative widgets are available
if you like your home screen more dashboard than application launcher.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26a4580.0x2b96338"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
The ZaTab is the most open tablet out there, and it should be on your
shopping list if you're looking for a tablet designed with end-user
freedom in mind. This is the ideal device for Android developers or Linux
developers looking to shoehorn a traditional Linux distribution onto
a tablet. There is a good chance you will see a full Linux distro
running on the ZaTab in the future. ZaTabs are in the hands of KDE and
Edubuntu developers, and surely on the wish lists of many other free
software developers out there. It runs most Android apps flawlessly&mdash;oh,
and did I say it was rooted out of the box? You don't have to be a hacker
to enjoy this tablet either, with plenty of storage and access to Google's
Play Store and Amazon's Kindle books, it makes a great media device. As I'm
wrapping up this review in early July, the ZaTab has yet to see official
release. Earl at ZaReason tells me there is still one minor software bug
to squash before the ZaTab is officially launched&mdash;debugging the HDMI
output driver to be specific. For the most up-to-date information on
when the ZaTab will be shipping, to pre-order one, or to order a developer
unit sans OS, visit the ZaReason Shop: <a href="http://zareason.com/shop/zatab.html" target="_self">zareason.com/shop/zatab.html</a>.
