You can't host the whole Internet yourself, but you can host
entire distributions!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2745580.0x283d358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you're the sort of person who installs Linux a lot, or if you have a large
number of servers/desktops to keep updated, having a local mirror can be
a real time and bandwidth saver. You may have a huge Internet connection
and want to set up a public mirror, but for the sake of this article,
let's assume you just want a personal mirror. I have a local mirror both
at home and at work, and I've never regretted setting it up.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11324f1.large.jpg"><img src="11324f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1.
My local mirror is simple, but very useful.
</p></div></div><p>
Before setting up your local mirror, there are a few considerations
you should keep in mind. First, mirrors tend to take a lot of space. My
current Ubuntu mirror comes in at 550GB, which doesn't include the ISO
images or the Partner repository. Granted, that has multiple architectures,
but still, the hard drive space is significant.
</p><p>
Another issue with maintaining a local mirror is that it takes a long
time to download initially. Depending on your Internet connection and
the speed of the mirror you choose to replicate, it can take days or
even weeks! With my 16Mbit connection at home, the daily updates take
about 30 minutes on average, but that initial download took a couple days.
</p><p>
Before delving into the process of setting up and maintaining your
mirror, if you're an Ubuntu user, you might be just as happy installing
squid-deb-proxy. Using squid-deb-proxy effectively will share any
previously downloaded updates any computer on your network makes. With
the help of avahi, it can be done automagically! See the
squid-deb-proxy sidebar for
more details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2745580.0x283d828"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>squid-deb-proxy</b></p><p>
If you're using only Ubuntu and don't want to set up an entire mirror of
files you'll rarely (if ever) use, squid-deb-proxy might be right up your
alley. On your server, you need to install two packages: squid-deb-proxy
and avahi-utils. When they're installed, start them up:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo start squid-deb-proxy
sudo start squid-deb-proxy-avahi
</pre>
</p><p>
And you're done! The only other step is to install the
squid-deb-proxy-client package on your workstations, and any deb files downloaded
first will look at your local network cache before downloading from
the Internet. Because it uses avahi (Zeroconf), the process is automatic,
so if you take your laptop out of your network, it updates like normal
from the Internet!
</p><p>
The only downside is that the installation process isn't squid-deb-proxy-aware
yet, so the network installs still will come from the Internet. If
you're just looking to speed up updates, however, squid-deb-proxy is
simple to set up!

Hosting Options</h2></div></div><p>
For the sake of simplicity, I recommend using HTTP to serve your
mirrored files. You can add other protocols if you like (rsync, FTP or
NFS), but at the very least, I recommend HTTP. Because most mirrors use a
subdirectory for file storage, you generally can just add a folder or
symlink to your current Web server and never touch the Web server's
config files. For this article, I assume you're adding the mirror
to your /var/www/default folder. If you're using a distro that is not
Debian-based, adjust your folder structure as necessary.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2745580.0x283dc48"></a>
The Initial Sync</h2></div></div><p>
Eventually, I'll explain how to automate the update process, but for the initial
sync, I recommend watching to make sure it works right. The method for
mirroring Ubuntu is similar to mirroring CentOS; it's basically a single
rsync command.
</p><p>
In order to be a proper netizen, you should locate a mirror that is close
to you. A list of Ubuntu mirrors is located at
<a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors" target="_self">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors</a>, 
and a list of CentOS mirrors is at
<a href="http://www.centos.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=13" target="_self">www.centos.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=13</a>.
</p><p>
Once you've determined the mirror you want to use (make sure to choose
one that supports rsync), create your local mirror directories:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo mkdir /var/www/default/ubuntu
sudo mkdir /var/www/default/centos
</pre>
</p><p>
Again, you can adjust the location of your mirrors however you like,
the above just creates folders in the default Apache server location
in Ubuntu. Using your local mirror address, type the following to mirror
the Ubuntu repository:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo rsync -a --progress \
rsync://your.ubuntu.mirror.com/ubuntu \
/var/www/default/ubuntu
</pre>
</p><p>
Then make a pot of coffee&mdash;or 20. You should get screens full of text
as your local mirror is created. Once that is finished, a similar one-liner will create your CentOS mirror:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo rsync -a --progress \
rsync://your.centos.mirror.org/CentOS/* \
/var/www/default/centos
</pre>
</p><p>
This will take a long time too. You may want to switch to decaf for this
second batch of coffee.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2745580.0x283e118"></a>
Look at Yourself in the Mirror</h2></div></div><p>
Assuming everything was done correctly, you should have a working
mirror! Test it out by going to
http://your.server.ip/ubuntu
and
http://your.server.ip/centos,
and see if you get a listing that looks like a mirror. If you get a
message about &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; from your Web server, you'll need to add
indexing options in order to see directory listings. Even without the
indexing options added, however, the mirror itself should work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2745580.0x283e278"></a>
Now What?</h2></div></div><p>
Depending on the mirror you chose for CentOS, you may or may not have
a mirror that includes ISO files. If you don't want the ISO files,
or a particular release version, you can, of course, modify the rsync
command appropriately. For example, adding <tt  >--exclude
isos</tt> will
completely ignore the entire isos folder, saving you lots of room
and lots of bandwidth. I encourage you to tweak the rsync commands to
create a mirror that serves your needs.
</p><p>
Once you have your mirrors tweaked how you like them, I recommend giving
them a good test. Install a system from your mirror. With Ubuntu,
the best way to do that is by getting the minimal install CD from
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD" target="_self">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD</a>
and booting it via CD or USB. When the installer asks you to choose a
mirror, scroll all the way to the top of the list and enter your server
address manually. If all goes well, the system should find your server
and install Ubuntu completely over the network. It's really pretty cool
to see.
</p><p>
For CentOS, you need to find a mirror containing ISO files and download
the netinstall ISO. Look in the iso folder inside the version number
folder for the iso file ending with netinstall.iso.
</p><p>
Booting from the netinstall ISO is simple, but knowing the mirror URL is a
little tricky. You'll want to use your local URL for something like this:
http://server.ip/centos/6.2/os/i386.
Obviously, you'll need to replace the &ldquo;6.2&rdquo; with whatever version of
the netinstall ISO file you downloaded. The installer should download
install.img, and from there the installer should look just like an install
using CDs or DVD.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2745580.0x283e590"></a>
Keeping It All Up to Date</h2></div></div><p>
Hopefully, you now have a fully working mirror on your local server. Of
course, in the time it took you to read this far into the article, it's
probably already outdated. That means you need some way to keep things
updated, preferably without any work on your part. Thank you cron.
</p><p>
At the very least, the commands shown above to do the initial rsync
will do the trick if you put them into cron. I recommend removing the
<tt  >--progress</tt> flag and adding
<tt  >--delete-after</tt> so that you don't get
so much feedback and so obsolete files are deleted from your mirror.
If you get tired of the nightly e-mail messages from the output, you might want
to add <tt  >&gt; /dev/null</tt> to the end of the cron line, so you're notified
only if there are errors.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, things often go wrong. Rather than putting the rsync
commands directly into your crontab, I recommend creating a couple scripts
with some error management. The script I use (Listing 1) is pieced together from
several people, cobbled a bit on my own, and has been shared all over.
Feel free to take from it and modify it as you like. After reading this
article, it should be self-explanatory, and it can be adapted for Ubuntu
or CentOS.

But I Want More!</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have the basic mirrors on your server, you'll quickly notice a
few things are missing. With Ubuntu, you won't have any ISO images. If
you want to have a local copy of ISOs, you can get that with another
simple rsync command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rsync -a --progress \
rsync://rsync.releases.ubuntu.com/releases \
/var/www/default/releases/
</pre>
</p><p>
Just like with the main archive, on subsequent rsyncs, I recommend
removing the <tt  >--progress</tt> flag and adding
<tt  >--delete-after</tt>. That will
keep your mirror clean. It's possible to create a script for this
process as well, but honestly, I just put the rsync one-liner in my
crontab. There aren't too many changes to the ISO repository; it 
really changes only when there is a release.
</p><p>
The Partner repository is a little trickier to mirror. There is no rsync
server set up for mirroring the Partner repository, and I suspect it is
because the Partner repo contains commercial software and mirroring it
violates distribution rights or some such thing. I'm not a lawyer, but
as long as you're mirroring on your local network for your own personal
use, I don't think you run any risk of breaking the law.
</p><p>
Because there is no rsync server for the Partner repo, the best way to
create and maintain a mirror is by using debmirror. debmirror is a neat
tool that uses the HTTP protocol to download packages and organizes
them to match the remote repository. It can be used for mirroring the
entire Ubuntu (or Debian) repository, but I usually use rsync for the
main archive, because it's so simple.
</p><p>
Setting up debmirror requires some work with GPG keys and modifying a
script to fit your needs. The folks at Ubuntu have outlined the process
(although they don't mention it can be used to mirror the Partner
repo!) here:
<a href="http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Debmirror" target="_self">help.ubuntu.com/community/Debmirror</a>.
</p><p>
I've also created a quick little video outlining how I keep my mirrors
in sync on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> Web site. Here is a video showing my setup:
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/video/mirror-partner-repo-canonical" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/video/mirror-partner-repo-canonical</a>.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2745580.0x2b49df8"></a>
Waste Not, Want Not?</h2></div></div><p>
Hosting your own mirrors takes a lot of disk space. The initial syncs
take a <span   class="emphasis"><em>ton</em></span> of bandwidth. If you run a network that would benefit from
a local mirror, however, it really can be worth the effort.
</p><p>
Once you have a local mirror set up, if you can afford the bandwidth,
I encourage you to become a public mirror. Canonical and CentOS have
methods and requirements for becoming a public and official mirror. Although
not everyone can do it, it's folks like you and me who make the Open
Source community so strong. Even if you can't contribute code, perhaps
you're in a situation to contribute bandwidth. I'm not, as neither of my
locations has enough bandwidth to support a public mirror, but perhaps
someone reading this article will!
