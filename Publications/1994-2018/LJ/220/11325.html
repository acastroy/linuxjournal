One of these things doesn't belong in the workplace. If you ask most people
in the business world, they'd say a penguin is a silly thing to keep at
work. Those of us in the server room, however, just snicker at such
foolishness. I'll take Linux over a committee meeting any day! This month,
we get to see Linux at work.
</p><p>
You might have noticed the past few months we've chosen a product or
program as &ldquo;Editors' Choice&rdquo; for the issue. It's a great way for us to
highlight something we find particularly awesome. This month, I introduce
Resara. Samba 4 has been in active development for years, but the folks at
Resara package the current build into a very functional Microsoft Active
Directory replacement. Their community version is full-featured and
free&mdash;it's definitely worth checking out.
</p><p>
Reuven M. Lerner talks about a particularly serious issue this month, as he
discusses database integrity. Databases often are overlooked as boring, but
we rely on them constantly. Having viable, accurate data is something we
assume, but Reuven shows us how to make that assumption possible. Dave
Taylor follows up with a tutorial on how to use shell aliases and
functions. We often take the simple tweaks in our .bashrc file for granted,
but Dave not only opens it up, he also shows how to add tweaks of our own.
</p><p>
The Raspberry Pi device is something most people in our circles are
familiar with, even if we haven't been able to get our hands on one! Kyle
Rankin,
as usual, takes something awesome and makes it even more so. Combining his
Nokia N900 and the Raspberry Pi, Kyle is able to interface directly with
the fancy new device. Whether you're interested in creating a
super-efficient media center or just like playing with embedded
devices, Kyle makes it simple.
</p><p>
My Open-Source Classroom column this month is all about smoke and
mirrors&mdash;without the smoke. Although certainly not practical for everyone, sometimes
having a local repository mirror is useful. I explain how to mirror CentOS
and Ubuntu. Be sure to bring lots of storage space!
</p><p>
When we think about compression, it usually means archiving or resource
conservation. Arun Viswanathan discusses LZO compression in Hadoop this
month, which uses saved space to decrease disk read times. Since LZO can be
decompressed very quickly, the advantages in data transfer times are
significant. Arun has code samples and usage examples that really show off
the benefits.
</p><p>
Jay Palat found a Vagrant he really likes. If you've ever deployed an
application only to have it work on some systems but not others, you'll
likely agree with him. Vagrant is a tool for providing a virtualized
development environment so you can test applications on multiple systems
without actually creating the entire test environment. It's certainly
possible to virtualize different types of installation environments, but
Vagrant allows you to test those environments with a single tool.
</p><p>
Linux has a great virtual filesystem layer that allows the seamless use
of underlying filesystems. Most people don't know that Samba does the same
thing for its fileshares. Richard Sharpe shows how to set up Samba VFS
Modules, giving us the advantages of different filesystem features via
Samba shares. Richard guides us through an example that really shows how to
leverage this little known feature of Samba.
</p><p>
Cloud computing is here to stay, and while the terminology and concepts are
new, our needs as end users haven't changed very much. Andrew Fabbro
teaches us to use Tarsnap, which uses familiar command-line commands to
manipulate tar files in the cloud. Amazon S3 and EC2 are the de facto
standard for cloud-based computing, and Tarsnap allows manipulation of
Amazon services using the handy-dandy command line. If you manage cloud
services, you'll want to check out Tarsnap.

Doc Searls ends our issue this month, which is usually how our magazine
ends. This time, however, he shares a chapter from his new book
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Intention Economy</em></span>, which is a brilliant piece on free markets and
the Internet. Are we slaves to Internet companies? Does the Internet work
for us, or are we slaves of on-line captors? Be sure to read the excerpt,
and be sure to enjoy this entire issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. Whether you're
interested in new products, coding examples, tech tips or cool projects,
this issue aims to please.

Shawn Powers is the Associate Editor for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. He's also the
Gadget Guy for LinuxJournal.com, and he has an interesting collection
of vintage Garfield coffee mugs. Don't let his silly hairdo fool you,
he's a pretty ordinary guy and can be reached via e-mail at

channel on Freenode.net.
