Although Samba does a very good job of serving files for Windows (and Linux)
clients, sometimes you want it to do more. This article introduces the
Samba VFS Layer and shows how to create a simple VFS module to extend
Samba's functionality.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2272580.0x236a1f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I am sure that many of you are aware of the Linux Virtual File System (VFS)
layer, which allows Linux to support many different filesystems, such as EXT3,
EXT4, XFS, btrfs and so on. However, I suspect you are less aware that 
Samba, the Windows file and print server for UNIX, also has a VFS. Just like 
the Linux VFS, the Samba VFS allows you to extend Samba's functionality to 
encompass different filesystems and perform some neat tricks. On the other 
hand, the Samba VFS lives in userspace, which makes it easier to develop and 
debug Samba VFS modules.
</p><p>
In this article, I introduce you to writing a Samba VFS module through 
the use of a simple example. The example is that of auditing access to a 
specific file. Although this example is a little simplistic for the sake of this
article, it could be extended in many ways to be more powerful.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2272580.0x236a408"></a>
A Quick Introduction to the Samba VFS Layer</h2></div></div><p>
Figure 1 shows how Samba normally is used. Users on Windows 
clients access files on a Samba server via the network.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11262f1.large.jpg"><img src="11262f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. A Windows Client Accessing Storage on a Linux Server
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 1 depicts a Windows client (although it could be running anything) 
connected to a server via the network and accessing files on the storage 
connected to the server. You would configure Samba to give the client access 
to parts of the filesystem of the Linux system on which it is running. You do 
this with shares.
</p><p>
Samba is told how to provide access to files by setting configuration 
information in the smb.conf file, which might be /etc/samba/smb.conf (if you 
have installed Samba from RPMs) or which might be /usr/local/samba/etc/smb.conf 
(if you have built Samba from source and installed it on your system).
</p><p>
The following shows a very simple smb.conf file. You should consult some of 
the documents listed in the Resources section for more information 
on each of the parameters shown in this example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[global] 
    workgroup = workgroup 
    server string = %h server 

    security = user 

[data] 
    path = /path/to/data 
    read only = no 
    vfs objects = vfs_demo 
    vfs_demo:audit path = aaa 
</pre>
</p><p>
Samba allows you to implement VFS modules in two different ways:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
As built-in and statically linked modules.
</p></li><li><p>
As shared libraries.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
You tell Samba about VFS modules for each share, and you can pass 
module-specific parameters to a module. An example of specifying a VFS module 
is shown in the smb.conf fragment above. The module for the [data] share 
is called vfs_demo, and it has one parameter called audit path.
</p><p>
If you do not specify any modules, Samba does not load any (except for the 
default, discussed below).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2272580.0x236aae8"></a>
The vfs_demo Module</h2></div></div><p>
In this article, I explain how to develop a simple Samba VFS 
module that allows you to specify auditing of accesses to files. The auditing 
that is performed is very simple and is not the same as security auditing 
that Windows performs using Security ACLs (SACLs), but it serves to 
illustrate some of the things you need to do in developing a Samba VFS. In 
particular, this module:
1) will allow you to specify the path prefix for files to be audited, and
2) will log all accesses of such files to /var/log/messages using syslog.
</p><p>
It has some deficiencies as well, which you might consider dealing with if 
you want to improve the demo module.
</p><p>
Various aspects of the code for this module, as well as how to build it and 
how to debug it, are discussed below after a more thorough introduction 
to the Samba VFS Layer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2272580.0x236aca0"></a>
More Detail on the Samba VFS Layer</h2></div></div><p>
Samba has a very flexible VFS system that allows you to combine functionality 
from several modules to customize the behavior of any share.
Figure 2 shows how VFS modules relate to the main Samba code.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11262f2.large.jpg"><img src="11262f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The Relationship between VFS Modules and the Samba Code
</p></div></div><p>
As Figure 2 suggests, a number of components are involved in the 
processing of requests from Windows clients:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The main Samba code, which receives all incoming requests and sends all 
outgoing responses, interprets the smb.conf file and so forth.
</p></li><li><p>
The VFS Layer, which provides infrastructure for the VFS modules themselves.
</p></li><li><p>
A default VFS module, vfs_default.c, which provides default actions in 
case no modules have been specified for a share.
</p></li><li><p>
The system layer, which the default VFS module calls to provide standard 
Samba actions for all of the VFS routines. They mostly translate into 
UNIX/Linux system calls.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
One of the most important aspects of the Samba VFS Layer is that VFS modules 
are stackable and, depending on the way they are coded, can:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Completely replace existing Samba functionality.
</p></li><li><p>
Augment existing Samba functionality.
</p></li><li><p>
Do both, perhaps based on filename or VFS function.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Because they are stackable, you can write a VFS module to augment or replace 
a small subset of the 100 or so VFS functions that Samba uses, which makes 
your life as a VFS module writer much easier.
</p><p>
First, however, when a Windows client connects to a share, Samba finds the 
required VFS module, and if it is a shared library, loads that shared library. 
It then calls the specified module's connect routine to allow the module to 
perform whatever initialization it has to.
</p><p>
Then, during normal operation, the following sequence of steps will be 
performed for requests from the Windows client:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
An SMB request is received from the client by Samba and undergoes initial 
processing within Samba itself. At some point, Samba then calls a VFS 
function to complete the processing of this request.
</p></li><li><p>
The VFS Layer then calls the requested VFS function in the first VFS 
module, vfs_mod_1, in the stack that implements that VFS function. The 
VFS function in this module could perform some initialization at that point.
</p></li><li><p>
That VFS function then calls the next module in the stack that implements 
the requested VFS function, which in this case is vfs_default.c. 
</p></li><li><p>
After performing some processing, if needed, vfs_default.c calls the 
relevant System Layer function in Samba.
</p></li><li><p>
Again, after performing relevant setup or other processing, the called 
System Layer function issues a system call.
</p></li><li><p>
After performing the system call, the kernel returns to the System Layer 
function that called it. Here, further processing can be performed.
</p></li><li><p>
The System Layer function first called then returns to vfs_default.c where 
further processing can be performed.
</p></li><li><p>
vfs_default.c returns to the first VFS module in the stack, which again 
can perform additional processing.
</p></li><li><p>
The first VFS module then returns to Samba.
</p></li><li><p>
Samba prepares a response with the data returned and sends it to the 
Windows client.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Finally, when a Windows client disconnects from a share, Samba calls the 
disconnect routine associated with the first VFS module in the stack that 
has defined one. 
</p><p>
There are some 100 or more VFS functions in the Samba VFS layer divided into 
the following classes:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Disk/share functions, which relate to connecting and disconnecting, quota 
handling and so forth.
</p></li><li><p>
Directory functions for performing operations on directories, like opening 
them, listing them and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
File functions, which constitute the largest group of operations. These 
include things like reading and writing files, creating them, opening 
them and so on.
</p></li><li><p>
NT ACL functions for getting and setting NT Security Descriptors on files 
and directories.
</p></li><li><p>
POSIX ACL functions for getting and setting POSIX ACLs on files and 
directories.
</p></li><li><p>
Extended Attribute functions for getting and setting XATTRs on files and 
directories.
</p></li><li><p>
AIO functions, for performing Async IO operations on files.
</p></li><li><p>
Off-line functions for handling off-line operations on files.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
However, in general, you need to worry only about the specific set of 
functions you need to implement, and in the case of this vfs_demo module, you
need to be concerned only with a small set of routines.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2272580.0x2362df0"></a>
Registering the vfs_demo Module with Samba</h2></div></div><p>
As you might have guessed, each VFS module registers itself with Samba and 
specifies the VFS functions that it implements. To do this, you need to 
create a C function in the format shown in Listing 1.

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2272580.0x2362f50"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. Registering Your Module with Samba</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

#include "includes.h"
#include "smbd/smbd.h"

#undef DBGC_CLASS
#define DBGC_CLASS DBGC_VFS

#define DEMO_MODULE_NAME "vfs_demo"

static struct vfs_fn_pointers vfs_demo_fns = {
        .connect_fn = demo_connect,
        .disconnect_fn = demo_disconnect,

        .opendir_fn = demo_opendir,
        .fdopendir_fn = demo_fdopendir,
        .mkdir_fn = demo_mkdir,
        .rmdir_fn = demo_rmdir,

        .open_fn = demo_open,
        .create_file_fn = demo_create_file,
};

NTSTATUS vfs_demo_init(void);
NTSTATUS vfs_demo_init(void)

        return smb_register_vfs(SMB_VFS_INTERFACE_VERSION,
                                DEMO_MODULE_NAME,
                                &amp;vfs_demo_fns);
}

</pre></div><p>
Here you have told Samba that you are registering a module called
&ldquo;vfs_demo&rdquo;,
the version of the VFS interface you conform to and that you implement the 
eight functions specified. The first two are a connect routine and a 
disconnect routine. The remaining ones relate to opening files and directories, creating files and directories, and removing directories.
</p><p>
Note: for reasons pointed out in the Samba VFS documentation (see Resources),
you should call your registration routine 
<tt  >&lt;module_name&gt;_init</tt>. This allows your module to be
built in the Samba source 
tree or outside it and as a shared module or a static module. In this case, I
called it vfs_demo_init and the Makefile that is generated below will take 
care of ensuring that the correct name is used in a shared module (as long as 
the patch mentioned below is applied).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2272580.0x23632c0"></a>
Building Your VFS Module</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have some code, it is time to think about building your module. 
Although you can add your module to the Samba source code, doing that is more 
complicated than the approach suggested here, which builds your VFS module 
outside the Samba source tree. However, you will need to have the Samba 
source code handy.
</p><p>
First, download the latest Samba source code (Samba 3.6.4 at the time of 
this writing) using:


<pre     class="programlisting">
wget http://ftp.samba.org/pub/samba/old-versions/samba-3.6.4.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, unpack the source and build it (for those who have not done this before, here are the steps):

<pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvf samba-3.6.4.tar.gz
cd samba-3.6.4/source3
./configure.developer
make
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
make install
</pre>
</p><p>
Note: if you do not want to replace the Samba version on your development 
system, you will have to download the source packages for your Linux distro 
(source RPMs for those distros based on RPMs) and build that RPM. Here I 
assume you are happy to build Samba from source and install it on your system. 
This might mean that you have to erase the distro-supplied Samba packages to 
avoid confusion with them.
</p><p>
In addition, you need to tell the system how to find the Samba shared 
libraries that are needed. You can do this as root with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
echo /usr/local/samba/lib &gt; /etc/ld.so.conf.d/samba-local-build.conf
ldconfig
</pre>
</p><p>
You can use <tt  >ldconfig -v</tt> to verify that it found your shared libraries.
</p><p>
Now that you have the Samba source and have built Samba, you can create a 
directory and add the code for the demo module to it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir demo_vfs
cd demo_vfs
# Use vim to add the code
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, you need to copy several files from the examples/VFS directory of the Samba source:

<pre     class="programlisting">
cp ../samba-3.6.4/examples/VFS/config* .
cp ../samba-3.6.4/examples/VFS/autogen.sh .
cp ../samba-3.6.4/examples/VFS/install-sh . 
cp ../samba-3.6.4/examples/VFS/configure.in .
cp ../samba-3.6.4/examples/VFS/Makefile.in .
</pre>
</p><p>
After that, you should apply the following patch to Makefile.in to allow your 
code to be built as a shared module:


<pre     class="programlisting">

--- Makefile.in	    2012-04-22 17:30:45.631698392 -0700 
+++ Makefile.in.new 2012-04-22 17:30:20.619140189 -0700 
@@ -36,7 +36,7 @@ 
 
 %.$(OBJEXT): %.c 
         @echo "Compiling $&lt;" 
 -       @$(CC) $(FLAGS) -c $&lt; 
 +       @$(CC) $(FLAGS) -c $&lt; -D$*_init=init_samba_module 
 
 
  install: default 

</pre>
</p><p>
(At the time of this writing, this patch has been applied to the Samba master
branch,
but it has not yet made it into the 3.6.x branch. The patch makes it easier for 
your module to be moved into the Samba source tree if it proves useful enough 
and makes documenting modules easier. You simply could edit Makefile.in and 
append <tt  >-D$*_init=init_samba_module</tt> to the line shown rather than creating a 
patch file.)
</p><p>
These files allow you to build your module; however, you must perform a 
few actions similar to those performed above when building the Samba source:

<pre     class="programlisting">
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-samba-source=../samba-3.6.4/source3
</pre>
</p><p>
After that, you should simply be able to run <tt  >make</tt> to build your source. 
However, <tt  >make</tt> will fail because there are no definitions for the eight 
functions that you are registering.
</p><p>
Note: if your OS does not use GNUmake, you will have problems with the above 
instructions because the Makefile created in the above steps uses GNUmake's 
syntax, and it will not work with other versions of make. The simplest way to 
fix this is to install GNUmake.

Creating the Needed VFS Functions</h2></div></div><p>
The connect and disconnect functions must perform some unique actions in this 
example, because the remaining six functions all rely on a background thread 
to send auditing messages to syslog so they can be added to /var/log/messages.
Listing 2 is the demo_connect function.

The key points to note here are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
You should use talloc for allocating memory for your module, and you should 
choose an appropriate context. When allocating memory that should last for 
the duration of the connection to the share, use the VFS handle for a 
context.
</p></li><li><p>
You should use <tt  >lp_parm_const_string</tt> to parse module parameters.
</p></li><li><p>
You should use the <tt  >SMB_VFS_HANDLE_SET_DATA</tt> macro to set up the context that
all your other routines need when they are called.
</p></li><li><p>
You should call the next VFS routine in the stack, in this case 
<tt  >SMB_VFS_NEXT_CONNECT</tt>, to give it a chance to do its module initialization 
work as well. (However, see the Samba VFS document mentioned below for 
cases where you do not want to call the Next module.)
</p></li></ol></div><p>
While in general you can call the next VFS routine before, after or during 
your processing, in this case, it is called first to make cleanup easier in 
the connect routine, because you are creating a thread to perform deferred work.
</p><p>
The next function to look at is the demo_disconnect function (Listing 3).

                            ctx,
                            struct demo_struct,

</pre></div><p>
In this case, you:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Call the next VFS function, <tt  >SMB_VFS_NEXT_DISCONNECT</tt>.
</p></li><li><p>
Use a function called <tt  >create_cmd</tt> to tell your background thread.
</p></li><li><p>
Use <tt  >pthread_join</tt> to wait for the background thread to exit.
</p></li><li><p>
Free up the context you created.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
At this point, it is worth mentioning that all of the VFS functions have names 
like those seen above (such as <tt  >SMB_VFS_CONNECT</tt> and
<tt  >SMB_VFS_NEXT_CONNECT</tt>), and their 
meanings are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Functions like <tt  >SMB_VFS_CONNECT</tt>,
<tt  >SMB_VFS_GET_NT_ACL</tt> and so on call that VFS 
function from the top of the stack of VFS modules. Within a specific VFS 
function, you would not call that function recursively; however, you might 
call other VFS functions to perform useful actions. For example, the vfs_acl_xattr.c 
module (in samba-3.6.4/source3/modules) calls
<tt  >SMB_VFS_GETXATTR</tt> to get 
extended attributes on files.
</p></li><li><p>
Functions like <tt  >SMB_VFS_NEXT_CONNECT</tt>,
<tt  >SMB_VFS_GET_NT_ACL</tt> and so on call the next 
function of the same type in the stack of modules. You usually would call 
the next function for your VFS function somewhere in your VFS function 
unless you have completely handled everything or an error has occurred and 
there is no longer any need to call the next function.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Finally, Listing 4 shows one of the actual functions for performing auditing
when a file has been accessed.

Testing and Debugging</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have all the functions implemented (either by entering them from 
scratch or downloading them from GitHub or by taking an existing module and 
modifying it), you can build the VFS module and install it.
</p><p>
Building the module is usually as simple as running
<tt  >make</tt>. If any errors are 
reported, fix the errors and re-run <tt  >make</tt> until the build completes 
successfully. 
</p><p>
The output from the build process you are using here is a shared module called 
vfs_demo.so. This file needs to be moved to the directory where Samba looks 
for shared modules. This is usually /usr/local/samba/lib/vfs. You will need to
copy vfs_demo.so to that location as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo cp vfs_demo.so /usr/local/samba/lib/vfs
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have done that, you can test whether it works. First, you 
need to ensure that you have a share defined that uses the newly created VFS module. 
The following smb.conf file defines such a share and includes some additional 
parameters to help with debugging:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[global] 
    workgroup = workgroup 
    server string = %h server 

    security = user 

    log level = 10
    log file = /var/log/samba/%m.log

    panic action = sleep 99999 

[data] 
    path = /path/to/data 
    read only = no 
    vfs objects = vfs_demo 
    vfs_demo:audit path = aaa
</pre>
</p><p>
The interesting things to note here are:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The log level has been set to 10, giving you lots of information about what 
is going on and going wrong with your new VFS module.
</p></li><li><p>
The log file has been set to /var/log/samba/%m.log, which will create a 
separate log file for each client that connects. This will make it easier 
for you to see errors during testing.
</p></li><li><p>
Finally, you have specified a panic action in case your module causes Samba 
to crash (for example, by seg faulting). The panic action causes the smbd that
crashed to sleep for a long time, giving you time to attach with gdb to
see why you crashed (although oftentimes you can tell why you crashed by
looking at the traceback in the log file).
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Once you have created that smb.conf in /usr/local/samba/etc/smb.conf and 
started Samba as root with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/samba/sbin/smbd
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2272580.0x28f6ca8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
you can check to see if it is running with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
ps -ax | grep smbd
</pre>
</p><p>
There should be two instances of smbd running. If they are not running, check 
for problems in /var/log/samba/smbd.log (although if the problems occur early 
enough, you will have to start Samba with
<tt  >/usr/local/samba/sbin/smbd -i -F</tt>
to determine why it failed before it could start logging information).
</p><p>
Once Samba is running happily, you can test your VFS module with smbclient:

<pre     class="programlisting">
smbclient //localhost/data -Usome-user%some-password
</pre>
</p><p>
Of course, you will have to ensure that the user you are testing with exists 
and that the user's password is set. You can do this with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
smbpasswd -a some-user
</pre>
</p><p>
Then you can set the user's password with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
smbpasswd some-user
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2272580.0x28f70c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where you will be prompted to enter the password. Once you have set the 
password for your user, you can try smbclient as shown above.
</p><p>
If all is working correctly, you should expect to see something like the 
following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Domain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.6.4...]
smb: \&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
Then you can issue commands to test your VFS module's functions. The sort 
of smbclient commands to try include things like <tt  >put
/path/to/some-file aaa</tt>
(where the target file matches the audit path specified above). If your module 
is working correctly, you would see the following in /var/log/messages:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Apr 29 13:02:27 localhost Samba Audit: File aaa accessed
Apr 29 13:02:27 localhost Samba Audit: File aaa accessed
</pre>
</p><p>
As you can see, one deficiency of the module currently is that there are 
multiple messages logged for some accesses.

Obtaining the Full Source Code</h2></div></div><p>
You can obtain the full source code for this demo module from GitHub via:


<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone git@github.com:RichardSharpe/demo-samba-vfs.git
</pre>
</p><p>
In the directory retrieved, you will find source code for the Samba master 
branch as well as the Samba 3.6 branch. Most of what has been discussed here 
relates to the Samba 3.6 branch. You also will find some README files.
</p><p>
The code in that repository builds against the Samba master branch and against 
Samba 3.6.x.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2272580.0x28f76a0"></a>
Final Thoughts</h2></div></div><p>
One of the issues you should be aware of is that the Samba VFS has changed 
over time; however, it is allowed to change only when a new major version is 
released. For example, there are differences between the Samba 3.5.x VFS, 
the Samba 3.6.x VFS and the VFS in the Samba master branch.
</p><p>
Indeed, the Samba master branch's VFS interface has been changed to make the 
VFS routine names more consistent as well as introducing at least two new VFS 
functions:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
An FSCTL function so that VFS writers now can write FSCTL handling 
functions.
</p></li><li><p>
A FILE AUDIT function so that VFS writers can handle file access auditing 
using the Windows approach.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
However, you now should be able to understand the Samba VFS Layer well enough 
to understand what existing modules are doing and even write your own VFS 
modules when the need arises.
