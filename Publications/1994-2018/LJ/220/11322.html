NoMachine's NoMachine</h2></div></div><p>
Even if your friends and colleagues aren't enlightened enough to run Linux,
you still can rule their PCs remotely. NoMachine's new NoMachine v.4 is a
free, remote desktop control application that now runs on Mac OS and
Windows in addition to the previously supported Linux. This multiplatform
support allows any PC running Linux, Mac OS or Windows to control any
remote computer running these same OSes, including full access to files and
programs, real-time audio and video streaming, secure file sharing even
through firewalls, screen capture and printing to any printer, all at a
high level of performance.

Sonatype Insight for Continuous Integration</h2></div></div><p>
Sonatype Insight for Continuous Integration (CI) solves a major problem
that anyone developing software today should care about&mdash;the discovery
of security and licensing issues with third-party components. Insight for
CI, Sonatype's latest intelligent tool for component-based software
development, enables developers to find quality, security and licensing
problems and enforce open-source policy at build time, before fixes become
costly and time consuming. Insight for CI supports agile development
processes with analysis of every component in every build, alerting
developers immediately of any changes or policy violations that put
their project at risk. Support for Hudson and Jenkins also is included.
Sonatype hosts the Central Repository, the software industry's primary
source for open-source components, housing more than 300,000 components and
serving more than five billion requests per year.

AnHai Doan, Alon Halevy and Zachary Ives' <span   class="emphasis"><em>Principles of Data
Integration</em></span> (Morgan Kaufmann)</h2></div></div><p>
How do you approach answering queries when your data is stored in multiple
databases that were designed independently by different people? This is the

Corsair Force Series 3 SSD Notebook Upgrade Kits</h2></div></div><p>
Give your beloved laptop a new lease on life with Corsair's Force Series 3
SSD Notebook Upgrade Kits, available in 120GB and 240GB sizes. Corsair says
that these solid-state drives enable users to increase their
laptop's performance, battery life and reliability in an affordable manner. SSDs provide
significant advantages over standard hard drives, such as faster data read
and write speeds, which can reduce software load and boot times. And
because SSDs have no moving mechanical parts, they help laptops run cooler,
reduce battery drain and resist data loss from bumps. The upgrade kit,
which includes a USB-to-SATA cable and migration software, makes switching
simple. The drives come in a slim 7mm-high case designed to fit in most
space-constrained laptops.
