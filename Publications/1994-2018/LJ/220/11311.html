<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #220, August 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Recently, some folks identified a bad patch that had gotten into the
3.3.1 kernel in the stable tree. It caused a certain set of hardware
to fail to wake up again, once it'd been suspended. The fix was
simply to revert the bad patch, after which the affected systems would
work fine again. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Greg Kroah-Hartman</b></span> refused to make the change in
his upcoming 3.3.2 release until <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> made the change in the
upstream git tree.
</p><p>
The result was an interesting debate between <span   class="bold"><b>Filipe
Contreras</b></span> and a
bunch of other developers over whether that was a good idea. Filipe's
argument was that the 3.3.x kernels represented the &ldquo;stable
series&rdquo;,
and had the goal of eliminating bugs and giving the smoothest ride
possible. Therefore, he argued, it made no sense to wait around for
bug fixes to be incorporated into the upstream git tree first. The
upstream git tree was for regular development, not stabilization, 
although the bug fix in question would result in real systems being able
to do real work, instead of sitting there in a hung state.
</p><p>
There were a number of responses to that argument from various
developers, including Linus. One argument made by <span   class="bold"><b>Willy
Tarreau</b></span> was
that if bug fixes didn't get into the upstream tree first, the
bugs potentially would reappear in the very next development release.
And, because each stable series was derived from a development release,
it was only by incorporating stable series fixes upstream that the
developers could ensure that fixes to one stable series would make it
into the next stable series.
</p><p>
Linus also pointed out that there had been a time when this particular
rule didn't exist, and the problem of fixes going into the stable
series and then being left out of the development tree happened &ldquo;all
the time&rdquo;.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Adrian Chadd</b></span> offered up a bit of history from
the <span   class="bold"><b>Squid Project</b></span>.
Apparently, it had a stable and a development branch that it
allowed to diverge, with the result that users wanted features and bug
fixes for the older tree that were incompatible with the newer one,
and mayhem ensued. So, Adrian argued, having a rule requiring changes
to the stable tree to be incorporated into the development tree was a
clean way to avoid that.
</p><p>
The really interesting thing about the whole discussion is that it
illustrates the way kernel development itself develops. Traditionally,
there's always been some aspect of the process that would bog down or
become in some way unworkable&mdash;whether it was the struggle to find a
good version control system, or identifying which people were the
right ones to send patches directly to Linus, or figuring out how to
do development while also producing a stable kernel for distributions.
Eventually something breaks down and reveals some set of nuances that
no one had noticed before. At that point, Linus and various other
folks typically take an algorithmic approach to smoothing things out
again. Sometimes the solutions break down later in new ways, and the
succession of adjustments is fascinating to watch over time.

<h2 class="title">Ubuntu's New DNS: Unknown Host</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #220, August 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
If you're the type of person who installs Ubuntu's server edition,
you're also likely the sort of person who knows how to configure network
settings. For most distributions, especially those based on Debian,
the process is a bit strange, but familiar.
</p><p>
To configure the various interfaces, you edit /etc/network/interfaces and
add the appropriate IP information, along with the gateway address. That
doesn't complete the process, however, because if you manually configure
the network interfaces, you need to add the DNS servers manually to the
/etc/resolv.conf file. That's the way it's always been, and I never put
much thought into it&mdash;until Canonical changed the way the resolv.conf
file works.
</p><p>
I'll admit, my initial reaction was one of frustration, but once
I got over myself, I have to say it makes much more sense to add
the DNS configuration right into the /etc/network/interfaces file as
well. My only complaint is that there aren't comments in either the
/etc/resolv.conf file or the /etc/network/interfaces file on actually how to
do it! (Thankfully, there is a note in /etc/resolv.conf warning
that any changes will be overwritten, but no hints on how to 
make changes properly.)
</p><p>
The process, as it turns out, is rather simple. In
/etc/network/interfaces, simply add a couple lines to the end of the
stanza for a particular interface&mdash;for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# The primary network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
 address 192.168.1.200
 netmask 255.255.255.0
 gateway 192.168.1.1
 dns-nameservers 192.168.1.1
 dns-domain example.com
 dns-search example.com
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll notice the last three lines contain a few unfamiliar directives. They
are fairly self-explanatory, but important to know. Once added to
the /etc/network/interfaces file like above, the /etc/resolv.conf
file is populated with the proper information when the network is
activated. It's fairly simple, and it makes sense to have all the settings
in one spot&mdash;but frustrating if you don't know about the changes!

If you're a Windows user, choosing an instant-messaging client actually can be
a little frustrating. Some of the more-popular clients are loaded with
advertising or cost a lot to get full functionality. Normally, I recommend
Windows users install the Windows version of Pidgin. Recently, however, I
stumbled across a nifty Windows-only IM client named Miranda.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11311fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Miranda is open source, ad-free and integrates perfectly into Windows.
Granted, Pidgin works brilliantly under Windows, but it always feels like what
it is&mdash;a port of a program designed for something else. Miranda has
only a
Windows version, and the one thing it does, it does quite well.
</p><p>
If the standard install of Miranda doesn't quite cover your needs, be sure to
check out the add-ons designed for it. Whether you want to add Facebook
chatting, integrate with Skype or check the weather,
there are tons of add-ons from which to choose. Check it out today at

<h2 class="title">Lightspeed on Your Desktop</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #220, August 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One area of physics that is hard to wrap your head
around is relativity. Basically, relativity breaks down into general
and special relativity. General relativity deals with large masses and
high energies, and it describes how space-time is warped by these. Special
relativity deals with what happens during high velocities. Many
odd and counter-intuitive effects happen when speeds get close to the
speed of light, or c. The problem is that these types of conditions are
quite far outside normal experience, so people don't have any frame
of reference as to what these effects would look like&mdash;enter Lightspeed.
</p><p>
Lightspeed is an OpenGL program that shows what an object would look
like as it travels closer and closer to the speed of light. Lightspeed
actually models four different effects that occur when you get close to the
speed of light. The first effect is called Lorentz contraction. This effect
causes objects to appear to shrink in the direction of travel. This is
scaled by a factor called gamma. Gamma is calculated by:
</p><p>
1 / sqrt(1 - v<sup  >2</sup>/c<sup  >2</sup>).
</p><p>
So, as you can see, as your velocity (v) gets closer to the speed of light
(c), the value gamma increases toward infinity. The length contraction is
calculated by 
</p><p>
l' = l / gamma.
</p><p>
This means the length of an object in the direction of travel
(l) decreases toward zero as the velocity increases toward the speed of
light. 
</p><p>
The second effect that Lightspeed models is Doppler shifting. You
probably have noticed the sound version of Doppler shift when a fire truck
drives by with its siren on. You can hear the shift in sound frequency
from high to low as it goes by. The same thing happens with light
too. As a light source comes toward you, it shifts in color toward 
blue. As it goes away, the color shifts toward red. 
</p><p>
The third effect
is something called the Headlight effect. When you have a light source
that is moving, the amount of light being emitted isn't the same in
all directions if that light source is moving. If the light is coming
toward you, it will appear brighter. If it is moving away from you, it
will appear darker. 
</p><p>
The last effect that Lightspeed models is something
called optical aberration. Because light travels at a finite speed,
the light from different parts of the object come to you at different
times. The end effect is that as an object comes toward you, it looks
stretched out. And, when it travels away from you, it looks squashed. This
is actually different from Lorentz contraction.
</p><p>
So, how can you see what an object would look like, taking all of these
effects into account? This is where Lightspeed comes in. Most distributions
should have a package available that you can install using their package
management system. If you are interested in building from source, it is
hosted at SourceForge. When you first start it up, it opens with a cube
set in the middle of a field made up of rods for the edges and balls for
the vertices (Figure 1). The beginning velocity is set as 1m/s. Since
this is an OpenGL program, you simply can grab the cube with your mouse
and spin it around, or up and down, in order to change the view of the
object. At the far right, you can set the velocity that the object has
relative to you, going from 1m/s all the way up to 299,792,457m/s
(the speed of light is 299,792,458m/s).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11311lightf1.large.jpg"><img src="11311lightf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Initial Scene on Starting Lightspeed
</p></div></div><p>
You can change the dimensions of the default cube object by selecting
the menu option File&rarr;New lattice (Figure 2). You can set how many
balls will be drawn in each of the three dimensions. You also can change
the smoothness factor when the object is rendered on the display. In this
case, it will look like what is shown in Figure 3. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11311lightf2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 3. Altering the Smoothness of the Rendering
</p></div></div><p>
You also have the option of
loading your own 3-D object, either in 3D Studio format (*.3DS or *.PRJ)
or in LightWave format (*.LWO). This new object is what will be rendered, and
the optical effects will be applied to this. You can save a snapshot of a
particular object at a particular speed in either PNG or TIFF format. You
also can export to an SRS file format (Special Relativity Scene). This is
a format used by the program BACKLIGHT, which is a specialized raytracer
used to illustrate relativistic effects. This lets you generate much
higher resolution images of the affected object.
</p><p>
In the Objects menu item, there are options for drawing supplementary
objects.
By default, the floating grid is selected. You also
can select coordinate axes, identifying the x, y and z axes. You can 
select the display of a bounding box for your object as well (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Displaying Axes and a Bounding Box around Your Object
</p></div></div><p>
Additionally, you
can animate the scene by selecting Objects&rarr;Animation in the
menu. This pops up a dialog box where you can select the starting and
ending points on the x axis and the loop time in seconds (Figure 5).
The scene then will be animated until you click stop.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11311lightf5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Setting Options for an Animation of Your Object
</p></div></div><p>
Above, I looked at the four effects Lightspeed can model and apply
to your object. By default, all of the effects are selected when you start
up. If you want to change which effects are being modeled, you can go to the
Warp menu item and select any combination of Lorentz contraction,
Doppler red/blue shift, Headlight effect or Optical aberration. So,
you can select only the Lorentz contraction and see what it looks like
at 90% of the speed of light (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Looking at Just Lorentz Contraction at .9c
</p></div></div><p>
You have quite a bit of control over the camera as well in
Lightspeed. You can select the focal length of the camera lens, going from
28mm to 200mm. You even can set a custom lens focal length by selecting
Camera&rarr;Lens&rarr;Custom. You can set the position of the camera precisely by
clicking Camera&rarr;Position. This displays a pop-up dialog, where you
can set the exact x, y and z values for its location (Figure 7). 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11311lightf7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Changing Camera Position for a Better View
</p></div></div><p>
You
can select what information is displayed on the screen by selecting the
menu item Camera&rarr;Info display. You can have the velocity, the time,
the gamma factor and/or the frame rate displayed on the screen. 
</p><p>
The
default background color is black, but you can change it to gray, white
or very white. This display is an OpenGL display, so you can select the
rendering mode. The default is shaded, but you can change it to wireframe
rendering. 
</p><p>
One of the really cool options is that you can spawn off
other cameras by selecting Camera&rarr;Spawn camera. This lets you see
your object from several different angles at the same time. So, now you
can see what it looks like coming and going at the same time (Figure 8).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11311lightf8.large.jpg"><img src="11311lightf8.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. Setting Up Multiple Cameras for Different Perspectives
</p></div></div><p>
Once you have the speed and the relativistic effects set, you probably
want to interact with the object a bit to see how it looks from different
directions and so on. If you click the left mouse button and drag around,
your object will be rotated around. If you click the left mouse button
and press Shift at the same time, the camera view will be moved
around, pointing in different directions. You can move the camera itself
by clicking the middle mouse button and moving it up and down
or left and right. You can move the camera in and out from the object
by clicking the right mouse button and sliding up and down. If you
completely mess up your view, 
you always can go back to the defaults
by clicking the menu item Camera&rarr;Reset View.
</p><p>
So, remember this program when you are studying special relativity. Now you
finally can see what it would really look like if you were traveling down
the tunnel with the protons in the LHC or what the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Starship
Enterprise</em></span>
would look like as it flew by at sublight speed.

<h2 class="title">Linux-Native Task Management? Check.</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #220, August 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Task management programs are commonplace in our busy lives, but it seems
that every system lacks something. Google Tasks is nice, but it lacks the features
of a more robust task management system. Remember the Milk is nice,
but it charges for some of its features. Many standalone task management
programs are great, but they don't sync between devices.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11311nitrof1.large.jpg"><img src="11311nitrof1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Thankfully, Nitrotasks is a Linux-based task management program that
not only syncs between computers, but also has some organization
features reminiscent of the &ldquo;Get Things Done&rdquo; method. When you add the
Web-based version and syncing compatibility with Dropbox or Ubuntu One,
Nitrotasks is worth checking out. It's simple, but its Linux-native
roots and Web-based access make it compelling. Be sure to put &ldquo;check

<h2 class="title">Linux in the Workplace Poll</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Katherine Druckman</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #220, August 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
We at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> HQ have a lot of Linux in our office.
It's on
desktops, laptops, servers, phones and tablets. We love Linux so
much, we even have a Tux Droid (<a href="http://lnxjr.nl/tux-droid" target="_self">lnxjr.nl/tux-droid</a>). We also
use a wide variety of non-Linux open-source software for various
purposes, and as FOSS has become more and more ubiquitous, we bet you
do too. So, we wondered how you, our readers, use Linux and open-source software in your workplaces. Thanks to all who answered our
short poll on LinuxJournal.com; we now have a better idea of how much
love our favorite operating system gets in your offices.
</p><p>
When asked how much Linux you use in the workplace, we're thrilled to
learn that the most-popular response (29%) was &ldquo;We're allowed to
choose the operating system we use, and the cool kids use Linux.&rdquo;
Freedom to choose your operating system is something we love to see.
And, although we are also excited that a solid 14% of you indicated that
everything you touch in your office uses Linux, we appreciate that
this is not always possible in every work environment, so we're happy
that most of you are in an environment where your preferences are
respected, whatever they may be.
</p><p>
We are also glad to report that 66% of you use Linux on your work
computers. The most popular flavor was Ubuntu, with Fedora a pretty
distant second. And to the 34% using Windows, we hope it isn't giving
you too many headaches!
</p><p>
86% of you use other, non-Linux open-source software, and a full 25%
of you use mostly open-source software on Linux. And to the 14% who
believe you are able to use open-source software just because no one
knows Firefox is open source, let's hope the powers that be remain
blissfully ignorant.
</p><p>
The most-popular reasons for using Linux at your companies are that
Linux saves money and is more secure, and we couldn't agree more. You
most commonly use Linux as a Web server, database server, desktop
system, file server, for software development and as a mail server.
Not too many of you are using Linux for movies and graphics, but we'd
love to hear more from the 8% who are. Please drop us a line if you'd
like to show off your work.
</p><p>
We are pleased that 32% of you are in your current position because of
your Linux expertise. We also understand that our readers are people
of many talents, so 44% of you hold your current position regardless
of your Linux knowledge.
</p><p>
Finally, we're relieved that 73% of your bosses do know what Linux is,
and to the rest of you, please let me know if you'd like my help in
staging an intervention. Your boss may thank you in the long run,
even if he or she thinks it's an air-conditioning company at the
moment. Rest assured that I feel your pain. When I first worked
for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, many of my friends were pretty sure I was writing
about china and crystal.

<h2 class="title">Resara Me This</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #220, August 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
More than any other program, Samba allows Linux desktops to exist in the
world of Windows. In fact, Samba historically has allowed Linux to live
secretly in the server room as well. It's possible to emulate a Primary
Domain Controller from your Linux server, and Windows machines can't
tell the difference. The problem is that Microsoft no longer uses PDCs
and has turned to Active Directory.

Thankfully, Samba version 4 has just entered beta, and it supports
Active Directory emulation! Although it's still in early beta stage, that
hasn't stopped the folks at Resara from packaging up the software into
a turnkey Active Directory replacement. Offering a fully functional
community version along with its only slightly more-functional
commercial version, Resara gives you a surprising feature set.
</p><p>
The server itself is built on Ubuntu, and its cross-platform (Linux,
Windows, OS X) GUI administration tool runs pretty much anywhere. It
offers simple administration of users, groups, computers, DNS and
DHCP. If you need further customization of the Active Directory itself,
Resara is compatible with Microsoft's own Group Policy Editor. That,
unfortunately, runs only on Windows.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11311resaraf2.large.jpg"><img src="11311resaraf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
The administration GUI is simple and effective.
</p></div></div><p>
You'll be hearing more about Resara from me in future issues, but
for folks looking to implement an Active Directory system without
the desire to pay for Microsoft licensing, check out Resara now!
The community version is at <a href="http://www.resara.org" target="_self">www.resara.org</a>, and the commercial version
is at <a href="http://www.resara.com" target="_self">www.resara.com</a>. I'm using the commercial version, both because
I want to support the project and because I'm sure I'll take advantage
of the technical support!

Linux really means business. It's not just an issue focus, but also a
reality. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> has been around since before Linux was cool.
We've seen it grow from a system praised by hobbyists and hard-core
geeks, through its not-so-awkward adolescence during the tech boom of
the late 1990s, and blossom into an operating system so elegant that is
has penetrated the mainstream and directly touches so many people in
such a way that few even are aware of its presence. As we all know,
few people who participate in the digital world in which we currently live
are not touched by Linux in some way. That said, if you are
reading this issue, you more than likely are one of the informed few
who helps power the open-source ecosystem that in turn powers the
lives of so many. To that end, we offer you LinuxJournal.com as a
resource to aid you in your pursuit of technical greatness. With
articles focused on programming, security, desktop, system
administration and more, we think you'll find it a handy reference for
staying up to date and discovering new skills that will help you make
the world a better place.
