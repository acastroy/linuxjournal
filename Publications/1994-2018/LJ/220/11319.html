Free markets should value free customers. Today's mass markets still
value captive ones. Some of us are starting to fix that.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x219b580.0x2293300"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I've been writing for <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> since 1996, and putting my learnings
to work along the way.
</p><p>
For example, in 1998, when a bunch of geeks got together and decided
to expand the free software conversation to include a broader category
they called open source (<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html" target="_self">www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html</a>), I watched&mdash;and learned&mdash;in amazement
as their strategy succeeded, in spades. Before February 1998, &ldquo;open
source&rdquo; was hardly uttered outside a few specialized circles, such as
the military. Thanks to Eric S. Raymond and other hacker evangelists,
the term became common parlance throughout civilization.
</p><p>
So, a year later, when I got together with three other guys and put
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Cluetrain Manifesto</em></span> up on the Web (<a href="http://cluetrain.com" target="_self">cluetrain.com</a>), our first thesis was &ldquo;markets are
conversations&rdquo;, in part because we saw it proven already. That summer,
when we expanded the Web site into a whole book, we said this in Chapter
Four:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
What's more, these new conversations needn't just happen at random. They
can be created on purpose. &ldquo;We hackers were actively aiming to create
new kinds of conversations outside of traditional institutions&rdquo;, Raymond
says. &ldquo;This wasn't an accidental byproduct of doing neat techie stuff;
it was an explicit goal for many of us as far back as the 1970s. We
intended this revolution.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Nice job.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Above <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cluetrain</em></span>'s 95 theses, was an alpha clue, written by Chris Locke and
addressed to marketers who were busy failing to understand how profoundly
this new thing, the Internet, changed markets by making its human
occupants&mdash;and not just marketers&mdash;more powerful. It said this:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
we are not seats or eyeballs or end users or consumers. we are human
beings and our reach exceeds your grasp. deal with it.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
More than any other single line, that adrenalized us. It also placed
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cluetrain</em></span> clearly on the side of people. As Jakob Nielsen put it to
me at the time (in words close to exactly these), &ldquo;You guys defected
from marketing, and sided instead with people in their fight against
marketing.&rdquo; (We were all techies, but three of us were also marketing
wretches, fed up with the whole thing.)
</p><p>
When Google Books made possible search across countless books, I was able
to observe with it the number of books in which the word
&ldquo;cluetrain&rdquo;
appeared. For years the number increased by an average of one per day,
until it reached five thousand, where it stands. Google's meter is
pegged there.
</p><p>
Yet for all the successes of free software, Linux, open source and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Cluetrain</em></span> (in that order), a problem persists. As human
beings, our reach
does not yet exceed the grasp of marketers. And, in many ways, the problem
we saw at the height of the dot-com bubble is worse today, as we are
lifted by marketing gas to the height of a new bubble variously called
&ldquo;Facebook&rdquo;, &ldquo;social media&rdquo;, &ldquo;big
data&rdquo; and &ldquo;personalized advertising&rdquo;.
</p><p>
So, in 2006, when I was given a fellowship with the Berkman Center
for Internet and Society at Harvard University, I decided to launch a
development project there. The purpose of the project was to give human
beings a reach that exceeded marketers' grasp. We called it ProjectVRM
(<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm" target="_self">blogs.law.harvard.edu/vrm</a>), in
which the last three letters stood for Vendor Relationship Management. The
term was meant as the customer-side counterpart of Customer Relationship
Management, the $18 billion enterprise software and services business
that gives the world call centers, junk mail and other ways of creating
distance between customers and the companies that purport to serve
them. The idea wasn't to fight CRM, but to engage it&mdash;and organizations
of all kinds&mdash;from the customer side, by providing individuals with
means for both independence and engagement.
</p><p>
As of today, there are dozens of VRM development efforts, operating in
dozens of countries. All are still at the narrow end of the adoption
curve, but it's clear where they're all headed. Once VRM succeeds,
I believe, we will enjoy an Intention Economy, based on what each
of us intends as sovereign human beings participating in a free and
open marketplace. In it I claim that free customers will prove more
valuable than captive ones, because our reach will outperform vendors'
grasp&mdash;and render that grasping obsolete.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11319f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
So, starting a couple years ago, I began work on a book titled <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge</em></span>, for Harvard Business
Review Press, based on progress in VRM development. It came out in
May of this year, and it's available in all the usual places and forms,
including digital and audio ones. With permission of the publisher,
I would like to share with you one chapter from the book. There are other
chapters that actually go into free software, open source, Linux and
other topics more typical of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span>, but mostly what I do in
those chapters is leverage the stuff I learned here, along with the rest
of you. This chapter is one that visits a larger problem rooted in the
ethos of Business as Usual, especially on the Web.
