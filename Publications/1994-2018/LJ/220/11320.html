&ldquo;Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have
the exact measure of the injustice and wrong which will be imposed on
them.&rdquo;&mdash;Frederick Douglass
</p><p>
&ldquo;The term 'client-server' was invented because we didn't want to call it
'master-slave'.&rdquo;&mdash;Craig Burton

The Argument</h2></div></div><p>
The World Wide Web has become a World Wide Ranch, where we serve as
calves to Web sites' cows, which feed us milk and cookies.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f4580.0x13ec4b8"></a>
Wholly cow</h2></div></div><p>
The Internet and the Web are not the same things. The Internet is a
collection of disparate networks whose differences are transcended by
protocols that put every end at zero functional distance from every
other end. The World Wide Web is one application that runs on the
Internet. Others include e-mail, messaging, file transfer, chat and
newsgroups, to name just a few. But the World Wide Web is the big one&mdash;so
big that we tend to assume it's the whole thing, especially since the
Web is where we spend most of our time online and when it has absorbed
so many other formerly separate activities. E-mailing, for example.
</p><p>
Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who invented the Web in 1989, later said it aspired
to be &ldquo;a universal linked information system, in which generality
and portability are more important than fancy graphics techniques and
complex extra facilities. The aim would be to allow a place to be found
for any information or reference which one felt was important, and a way
of finding it afterwards.&rdquo; He did not intend to create a vast online
shopping mall, an industrial park of advertising mills, or home to a
billion-member &ldquo;social network&rdquo; owned by one company. But that's what
the Web is today. True, somewhere in the midst of all that other stuff,
you can still find the simple, linked collection of documents that Sir
Tim meant for the Web to be in the first place. But that collection is
getting harder and harder to find, mostly because there's no money in
it.
</p><p>
Thus, the Web we know today is largely the commercial one that appeared
in 1995, when Netscape and Microsoft created the first retailing Web
servers along with the first widely used Web browsers. The commercial
Web's early retailing successes&mdash;notably Amazon and eBay&mdash;remain
sturdy exemplars of selling online done well. A key to their continued
success is <span   class="emphasis"><em>personalization</em></span>, made possible by something
called the <span   class="emphasis"><em>cookie</em></span>:
a small text file, placed in your browser by the Web site, containing
information to help you and the site remember where you were the last
time you visited.
</p><p>
Those ur-cookies have since evolved (among other things) into breeds
of Trojan marketing files. Variously called &ldquo;Flash cookies&rdquo; (based on
Adobe's proprietary Flash technology), &ldquo;tracking bugs&rdquo;,
&ldquo;beacons&rdquo;, and
other names, they track your activities as you go about your business on
the Web, reporting back what they've found to one or more among thousands
of advertising companies, most of which you've never heard of (but some
of which we visited in the last chapter).
</p><p>
The online advertising business says the purpose of these tracking
methods is to raise the quality of the advertising you get. But most
of us care less about that than we do about being followed by companies
and processes we don't know and wouldn't like if we did.
</p><p>
While much complaining is correctly addressed to the creepy excesses of
the online advertising business, little attention has been paid to the
underlying problem, which is the design of the commercial Web itself. That
design is <span   class="emphasis"><em>client-server</em></span>, which might also be called calf-cow. Clients
are the calves. Servers are the cows. Today, there are billions of
commercial cows, each mixing invisible cookies into the milk they feed
to visiting calves.
</p><p>
Client-server by design is submissive-dominant, meaning it puts servers
in the position of full responsibility for defining relationships and
maintaining details about those relationships. And, since this is all
we've known since 1995, most of the &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; we've come up with are
more sites and site-based services. In other words, better cows.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f4580.0x13ecb98"></a>
What are your names?</h2></div></div><p>
Back before computing got personal, and all the computing that mattered
was done in enterprises, one of the biggest problems was a proliferation
of <span   class="emphasis"><em>namespaces</em></span>. (In technical terms, a namespace is an identifier or
a directory for them.) Different software systems each had their own
namespaces. For the enterprise, this meant an employee, or information
about an employee, might be known by different names and attributes,
within each of the separate software systems used in human resources,
marketing, sales, accounting, and so on. For an employee, this meant
maintaining up to dozens of different logins and passwords. For the HR
and IT departments, it meant integration hell, or the impossibility of
any integration at all. To this day, the namespace problem is one of
the most vexing in all of enterprise computing.
</p><p>
Out on the Web, that's solved for sellers, because each tends to have one
customer-facing system. But for us customers, it's still a mess, because
the old corporate namespace problem is now ours, multiplied by the number
of relationships we have on the Web. Thus, we are required to keep track
of as many different logins and passwords as there are Web sites. This
makes the problem as big as the sum of all Web sites. At last count (as I
write this), there are over 200 million registered domains, about half
of which have the commercial <span   class="emphasis"><em>.com</em></span> suffix. Since some domains have many
retail sites (eBay and Etsy, for example), the total number of commercial
sites is much higher. Search for &ldquo;privacy policy&rdquo; and Google will tell
you it appears on more than a billion Web pages. Even if one login and
password might get you to all of eBay and Etsy, we are still talking
about hundreds of login-password combinations. Enterprises don't care,
because it's not their problem. They care only about their relationship
with you. Not about your relationships with every other company. That
leaves you and me with an umpty-million (or -billion) namespace problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f4580.0x13ece00"></a>
Login rolling</h2></div></div><p>
There are partial workarounds. You can set up browsers to automatically
fill out forms and auto-complete commonly typed strings of words and
numbers. There are programs that remember passwords for you. But the
most popular &ldquo;single sign-on&rdquo; (SSO) methods are provided by grace of your
relationship with Facebook, Google, Twitter, or Yahoo. Those ubiquitous
&ldquo;Connect with Facebook&rdquo; buttons, for example, are the
user-facing side of a program called Facebook Connect.
</p><p>
When Facebook announced Facebook Connect in December 2008, Mark Zuckerberg
wrote this in the company blog
[<a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=41735647130" target="_self">blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=41735647130</a>]:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Over the summer we announced
[<a href="http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=24577977130" target="_self">blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=24577977130</a>] an
extension of the Facebook Platform called
Facebook Connect [<a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?page=229348490415842" target="_self">www.facebook.com/help/?page=229348490415842</a>]. Facebook Connect makes it easier for you to take your
online identity with you all over the Web, share what you do online with
your friends and stay updated on what they're doing. You won't have to
create separate accounts for every website, just use your Facebook login
wherever Connect is available.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
To call your Facebook identity your &ldquo;online identity&rdquo; is delusional as
well as presumptuous, because none of us interact only with Facebook on
the Web. But that by itself isn't the only problem. The larger problem
with Facebook Connect is unintended data spillage. For example, what
if you don't want to share &ldquo;what you do online with friends&rdquo;, or if you
think you're just taking Facebook's shortcut when you log in for the first
time at some other site? In other words, what if you only want Facebook
Connect to be what it presents itself as: a simple login option for you
at another site&mdash;with no &ldquo;social&rdquo;. Or, if you do want to be
&ldquo;social&rdquo;,
how about being selective about what Facebook data you're willing to
share&mdash;exposing some data to some sites and different data (or no data
at all) to other sites? In other words, what if your &ldquo;privacy
preferences&rdquo;
aren't just the one-set-fits-all selections you've made at Facebook?
</p><p>
The site I Shared What?!? [<a href="http://ISharedWhat.com" target="_self">ISharedWhat.com</a>], created by VRM developer
Joe Andrieu, does an excellent job of simulating what you reveal about
yourself and others when you use Facebook Connect. Here's what it just
told me:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
You've just shared: your basic details, your news feed, your friends on
Facebook, the activities listed on your profile, the interests listed on
your profile, music listed on your profile, books listed on your profile,
movies listed on your profile, television shows listed on your profile,
all the pages you have &ldquo;liked&rdquo;, your shared links.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
That's <span   class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> I jiggered my privacy settings in Facebook to reveal as
little as possible. The results were the same both times, before and
after. I'm no dummy, but&mdash;as of this writing&mdash;I have no idea how to
keep from spilling rivers of personal data when using Facebook Connect. So
I just avoid it.
</p><p>
But I'm the exception. As of December 2010, a quarter-billion people
were logging into 2 million Web sites using Facebook Connect, with 10,000
more Web sites being added every day.
</p><p>
Privacy is the marquee issue here, but the deeper problem is
control. Right now you don't have much control over your identity on the
Web. Kim Cameron, father of the cross-platform Identity Metasystem when
he was an Architect at Microsoft, says [<a href="http://www.identityblog.com/?p=838" target="_self">www.identityblog.com/?p=838</a>] your &ldquo;natural
identity&rdquo;&mdash;who
you are and how you wish to be known to others&mdash;gets no respect on
the commercial Web. Every cow thinks you are its calf,
&ldquo;branded&rdquo; almost
literally. In the World Wide Dairy, all of us walk around with a brand
for every Web site that gives us milk and cookies. Our virtual hides
are crowded with more logos than a NASCAR racer.
</p><p>
Who you are to the other cows is not of much interest to any one cow,
unless they &ldquo;federate&rdquo; your identity with other cows. Think of federation
as &ldquo;large companies having safe sex with customer data&rdquo;. That's what I
called it in a keynote I gave at Digital ID World in the early 2000s. It
still applies.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f4580.0x13ed958"></a>
Tough teats</h2></div></div><p>
A similar problem comes up when you have multiple accounts with one
site or service, and therefore multiple namespaces, each with its own
login and password. For example, I use four different Flickr accounts,
each with its own photo directory:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Doc Searls&mdash;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls" target="_self">www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls</a>
</p></li><li><p>
Linux Journal&mdash;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/linuxjournal" target="_self">www.flickr.com/photos/linuxjournal</a>
</p></li><li><p>
Berkman Center&mdash;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/berkmancenter" target="_self">www.flickr.com/photos/berkmancenter</a>
</p></li><li><p>
Infrastructure&mdash;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure" target="_self">www.flickr.com/photos/infrastructure</a>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The first is mine alone. The second I share with other people at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>. The third I share with other people at the Berkman Center. The
fourth I share with other people who also write for the same blog.
</p><p>
Flickr in each case calls me by the second person singular
&ldquo;you&rdquo; and
does not federate the four. To them, I am four different individuals:
one cow, four calves. (Never mind that three of those sites have many
people uploading pictures, each pretending to be the same calf.) My
only choice for dealing with this absurdity is deciding which kind
of four-headed calf I wish to be. Either I use one browser with four
different logins and passwords, or I use four different browsers, each
with its own jar of cookies. Both choices are awful, but I have to choose
one. So I take the second option and use one browser per account&mdash;on
just one laptop. When I use other laptops, or my iPhone, my Android,
or the family Nokia N900, an iPod Touch, or an iPad, I'm usually the
first kind of calf, using one browser to log in and log out every time
I post pictures to a different account. Which I mostly don't do at all,
because it's one big pain in my many asses.
</p><p>
Crazy as all this is, it hardly matters from the cow side of the
cow-calf relationship. In fact, the condition is generally considered
desirable. After all, the World Wide Ranch is a real marketplace: one
where cows compete for calves. Hey, what could be more natural?
</p><p>
The media, even online, are no help either. Business publications, both
online and off, love to cover what I call &ldquo;vendor sports&rdquo;, in which
customers are prizes for corporate trophy cases. That's why business
writers often regard &ldquo;owning&rdquo; customers as a desirable thing. For
example, in &ldquo;Rim, Carriers Fight Over Digital Wallet&rdquo;, from the March
18, 2011, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></span>, Phred Dvorak and Stuart Weinberg write,
&ldquo;RIM and carriers like Rogers Communications Inc. in Canada, and
AT&amp;T
Inc. and T-Mobile in the U.S., disagree over exactly where on the phone
the credentials should reside&mdash;and thus <span   class="emphasis"><em>who will control the
customers</em></span>,
revenue and applications that grow out of mobile payments.&rdquo; The italics
are mine.
</p><p>
In the dairy farm model of the marketplace, captive customers are more
valuable than free ones. Since this has been an ethos of mass marketing
for a century and a half, the milk-and-cookies system of customer control
has proven appealing to businesses outside the online world as well as
within it. As of today, both worlds are worse off for it as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x12f4580.0x17e65a0"></a>
So, then</h2></div></div><p>
For free markets to mean more than &ldquo;your choice of captor&rdquo;, we need
new systems that operate on the principle that free customers are more
valuable&mdash;to both sellers and themselves&mdash;than captive ones. Improving
slavery does not make people free. We need full emancipation. That's
the only way we'll get free markets worthy of the name.
