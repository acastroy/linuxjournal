The sun is out, the temperature is
steadily rising, pale legs find themselves thrust into the glare
of day and multiplexes are showing 12 screens' worth of sequels&mdash;must be
summer. Remember being a kid, when summer meant doing things you never
had the time to do when school was in session? These days, few of us
have the luxury of summers off, but that doesn't mean we can't do
something adventurous this August. So stop mourning Buffy, quit
complaining about <span   class="emphasis"><em>Reloaded</em></span> and do something you've wanted to do
but didn't have the time for: build your own workstation, put a Linux
installation on your laptop that actually works, transform a spare computer
into a server. And to help you with these projects, the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web site offers the following articles and tutorials.
</p><p>
First off, if you've been following Jay Docherty's Linux on the
laptop series, he wrapped it up with &ldquo;Polishing Your Linux Laptop
Setup&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6891" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6891</a>). This article discusses how to go
wireless, how to install ALSA sound support and how to set up the
ACPI power management component. Jay admits &ldquo;ACPI can be a beast to
set up&rdquo;, but it can reduce the clock speed when the laptop is
idle to increase battery life and
control the system's fans for thermal protection. All in all, if
you're wanting to put Linux on your laptop, Jay's complete series
is worth a read.
</p><p>
In &ldquo;High Availability Linux with Software RAID&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6412" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6412</a>), Micah Silverman describes how he
recycled a system to create an HA server. He explains how to
use &ldquo;software RAID Level 5 under a fresh installation of Red Hat
8.0&rdquo; and
how to test the fault tolerance of the RAID. Before going live with this
setup, Micah built a testbed by using VMware &ldquo;to set up a Linux virtual
machine with six 9GB SCSI drives...on a machine with only one real physical
IDE drive&rdquo;.
</p><p>
If you've been wanting to build your dream Linux machine, you might want
to check out Glenn Stone's weekly articles about the components he's
thinking of including in this year's Ultimate Linux Box. &ldquo;Getting
Serial: the Ultimate Linux Box S-ATA Disk Subsystem&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6902" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6902</a>) weighs the benefits of using
serial ATA drivers against their higher cost compared to traditional ATA
controllers. Specifically, Glenn discusses the performance of 3ware's
8500-4 serial ATA card. When used in our testbed machine, Glenn
found that serial ATA offers &ldquo;some fairly serious bang&rdquo; for not too many
more bucks. Glenn has also been thinking about what sort of video card the
&ldquo;Ultimate&rdquo; machine should have (&ldquo;Some Graphic Remarks: VGA for the Ultimate Linux
Box&rdquo;,
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6922" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6922</a>). To that end, ATI's new Fire GL X1
workstation card may be just the card to get us closer to the dream.
This card has dual DVI-I digital/analog outputs that each have a
DVI-to-VGA adapter, so you can use a standard monitor instead of a
digital one.

These are only a few of the projects you can take on with the help of
the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web site. Search the site for other ideas; new
projects are posted every week. If you'd like to share your own
project, send the proposal to <a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>.
