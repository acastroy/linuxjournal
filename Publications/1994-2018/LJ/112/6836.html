SE Linux gives you an extra layer of security that protects
the system even from root. Russell decided to show how it works
by giving everyone root access.

Since the middle of 2001, I have been working on
NSA Security Enhanced Linux [see page 20 in this issue] both on packaging it for Debian and in general
development. When describing the project to Linux users, I find much
confusion exists about what SE Linux does; it is difficult to gain a full
understanding of SE Linux from reading the documentation or attending a
presentation. Also, many people who have prior experience in security want to
gain some practical experience but don't have the time to install SE Linux
to experiment. I decided that a good way to teach people about SE Linux
would be to set up a machine with public access for anyone to use.
</p><p>
Demonstrating SE Linux in a regular configuration is not particularly
exciting, as the only noticeable operations it restricts for non-root users
are <b  >ps ax</b>
and <b  >dmesg</b>.
In a default configuration, <tt  >ps ax</tt> shows an
unpriviledged user only the other processes in the
same user domain, and <tt  >dmesg</tt> is blocked.
This is similar to the restrictions imposed by OpenWall and is
nothing new in itself. I decided to grant root access to the world using
only SE Linux for security, so users can see exactly what
it is capable of doing.
</p><p>
On June 6&ndash;9, 2002, at LinuxTag in Karlsruhe, Germany, I ran an SE Linux
demo machine at the Debian stand. This was the first SE Linux play machine.
At the time, the default policy was less restrictive than it
currently is. It allowed setuid and DAC_OVERRIDE capabilities for regular users
(user_t domain). For a regular SE Linux configuration, this is fine. SE Linux
does not use uids when deciding whether to grant access, and DAC_OVERRIDE
allows overriding the UNIX access controls, but not any SE controls. The reason
these capabilities were granted was to allow running setuid programs from
the user_t domain without needing SE Linux domains for such programs. So
although
those capabilities were satisfactory for the typical user, they were not suitable for the
unusual situation of having a root user who should be banned from accessing
other uids in the same domain.
I removed these capabilities from user_t, restricted the
root account to the user_r role and it was ready to go.
</p><p>
In recent releases, the default policy has changed to not grant setuid
or DAC_OVERRIDE capabilities to user_t. So, the most significant security
policy difference between my play machine and a real server is that on the
play machine unprivileged users are permitted to read the kernel message
log (dmesg) and the security policy source as an aid to understanding SE
Linux.
</p><p>
My SE Linux challenge is based on a machine deliberately configured
to be less secure than real servers, by granting log file access, granting
read access to the security policy and allowing unprivileged users root
access. In spite of these factors, little success was had in breaking the
security.
</p><p>
On the first day of LinuxTag, a potential issue with /boot files was reported.
A user believed he could determine the LILO password from the LILO map
file. I immediately changed the policy to restrict the access
to /boot to prevent such problems. Of course, if you have physical access
to a machine you usually can break the security somehow, but we want to make
it as difficult as possible.
</p><p>
During the event, I started work on support for multiple user roles. The
initial reason for this was one of my colleagues used the play machine
for more serious purposes. He lost all his files, because they were created
by the root:user_r:user_t security context as uid root, the same as users
who were testing the security. The standard test that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>everyone</em></span> ran as root
was <tt  >rm -rf /</tt>, which deleted all his files. The
system
itself was unharmed, as files in /bin, /etc and other system directories cannot be
unlinked or written to by user_t. After I gave my friend an account with the
domain user1_t, his files could not be accessed by a root user in domain user_t.
</p><p>
On June 17, 2002, I set up an SE play machine on a Cobalt Qube that is
available on the
Internet for everyone to use. The first machine was
on-line intermittently until July 11. The uptime for the play machines has not been great,
because they need to be monitored continually.
Such a machine would have the potential to become a risk to everyone,
including me,
my ISP and people who use it, if it was cracked and I didn't respond fast
enough. So whenever I go on holidays or am busy with work, I have to take it
off-line.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x149d580.0x1595710"></a>
How It Was Set Up</h2></div></div><p>
The machine had its own iptables setup to prevent undesired network access
from leaving the local machine. It also was placed behind a firewall, which
applied similar restrictions on data transfers. This setup prevented any user from
even probing my firewall from the inside unless they first cracked the
security of the play machine. I initially allowed most outbound network
connections other than SMTP, but I soon changed this to allow only outbound
connections to a Web proxy. SSH tunnels could be used for other Net access.
Also, I denied X forwarding so that if a user mistakenly enables it on
his client, his machine can't be attacked by other users on the play machine.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x149d580.0x1595818"></a>
How Secure Was It?</h2></div></div><p>
When the play machine had been on-line for less than a day,
a user reported that /etc/shadow could be read. This directory
was declared to be outside the scope of the LinuxTag demonstration, but
I should have fixed it before putting the machine on-line. I changed the shadow
file to have the type shadow_t, which required changes to the spasswd
wrapper program and the SE policy for it.
</p><p>
Adding full support for shadow_t was difficult because, in many instances, the
same program changes /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow by re-creating them, thus
giving them the default context of etc_t. I could have modified those
programs to use the open_secure(2) system call to specify the security context
at file creation time. I decided not to, however, because it would involve a lot of
work on security critical applications, creating the risk that an error might weaken
security. Instead, I wrote wrapper code to run those programs and set
/etc/passwd back to etc_t after the program exits. I also made shadow_t the default
type for those programs when creating files in /etc. Still,
even when /etc/shadow had the type etc_t, it
prevented unauthorized root users from writing to it. It was read-only to root
users in the user_t domain.
</p><p>
The next day, someone discovered that /dev/nvram was not adequately
protected. It was writable by everyone, therefore any user could make the
machine unbootable by scrambling the BIOS setting. Potentially, they could
have made the Qube BIOS pass different parameters to the kernel to weaken
security on the next boot. The Cobalt BIOS performs the functions that a
bootloader such as LILO would perform on other machines. I changed the
policy to fix that glitch immediately. It is important to note that different
platforms, either different CPU architecture or a different hardware, may
require similar minor changes to the security policy to match different
device nodes in /dev. With the current policy there is little risk of this
causing insecurity, as the default is to deny most operations related to
device nodes.
</p><p>
Some people were concerned that I had not appropriately granted authorization
and wanted reassurance that they were not doing anything illegal, so I
changed the /etc/motd to state that the machine was put on-line for the purpose
of security testing. I explained that it would be acceptable to break the
security in any way, including methods that may render the machine
unusable,
as long as I was informed of the method used. I also stated that it was not
to be used for launching attacks on other machines, although I tried to make
that impossible with firewall rules. Finally, I requested that no one try
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, as they are boring and that is not the aim of
the exercise.
</p><p>
From June 20 on, the operation of the play machine was fairly
uneventful. In February 2003, I put a play machine on-line at the Debian stand at
OSDEM and announced it as a capture the flag contest. This received a
surprising amount of interest; at times there were up to 30 people
watching one person trying to crack the security. A user managed to
get the easy flag, accessing a file in a specified non-root account after
logging in as root. He did this by setting the EDITOR environment
variable and running <tt  >crontab -e</tt>. The crontab program ran the editor
with more SE privileges than a regular program and allowed greater
access.
Even
though the exploit would not work in a typical server configuration, because
you don't give untrusted users root access even if you are
running SE Linux, I changed the policy for the crontab program to prevent
doing so. Even with this, the crontab attack still was confined to a single user
role. Therefore, any accounts that were in different domains, such as the
one I used for running the play machine, could not be touched.
</p><p>
One ongoing problem I experienced was that of resource usage. Many users
thought they had achieved something by filling the filesystem or
running the machine out of other resources. The message about DoS
attacks didn't seem to receive much notice.
</p><p>
Another interesting problem I had was trying to convince users they
actually were root. I had GCC installed, and many users compiled their own versions
of <b  >ps</b> and other utilities in the belief that they weren't really root
and that it was all a trick with modified utilities. One user even had
assembly
code to call the getuid() system call to determine whether I had
modified libc6. Although that user really was root, it would be a fun exercise to modify libc6 to
pretend that someone had logged in as root when they really had not. I
encourage readers to try this out for themselves.
</p><p>
Of course, not all users were so difficult
to convince. I gave the password to a &ldquo;black
hat&rdquo; person who was seeking machines for the
installation of a rootkit. He tried installing
his rootkit but found that all the relevant
directories (/bin, /sbin and /etc) and the files
they contained were not writable. He asked
for assistance in installing,
but I was unable to help him.

How to Run Your Own Security Test/Challenge Machine</h2></div></div><p>
If you want to run your own security test machine, the first thing to do is find a suitable place to house the server. This
is easier said than done, as such a machine attracts a lot of network scans
and penetration attempts on the network. The terms of service of most
ISPs prohibit such things, and you risk being disconnected.
</p><p>
Once you have arranged the hosting, you have to devise a good method
for taking the machine off-line in a hurry in case something goes wrong.
Direct physical access to the power switch is convenient for this purpose. A method
of controlling the power or hardware reset over the Internet also is a good
option. Failing that, you should install the test machine on its own switch
port, for a managed switch, or, as a cheaper option, on a crossover cable to
a Linux machine running Netfilter. This way, you can disable network
access to
the entire machine quickly.
</p><p>
The next thing to do is choose suitable hardware. For example, an iPAQ
is not ideal for this type of machine, as it is possible to render it unusable through
software. Commodity desktop PC hardware is a good option, though.
The worst-case scenario would be replacing the
motherboard, which is cheap
and easy. Another good option is to obtain free hardware, so you won't
have lost any money if the system dies. Some nice hardware seems to end up
in the rubbish nowadays.
</p><p>
Once you have the machine basically configured, you have to set up suitable
packet filters to prevent it from being used for attacks on other machines. How
strict these filters are depends on the agreement you have with your ISP.
If you have no specific agreement regarding such access&mdash;if you are
using a home broadband connection&mdash;then the filters should be very strict. If
your contract specifically permits running servers, you can allow
greater access, even the ability to host Web pages. Granting more network
access allows more interesting tests to be performed. A frequent complaint
from users was the test machine didn't have enough access granted to
allow a wide enough range of testing. For the next play machine, I plan to provide full network
access, so users can receive mail on the machine, host Web pages and
do most other things that they request.
</p><p>
The firewall should be set up both on the test machine and on any other
machines on the same physical network. The test machine can be
configured reasonably with Netfilter to discard or reject the packets
silently, without
logging them, although you may want to log them for interest. The router
should be configured to log all such packets when it drops them, so you
know if someone gets past the filter on the test machine or cracks
its security in any other way. If your ISP knows of your plans for a
security test server, then a minimal firewall should work. This will prevent SMTP
connections, spoofed source IP addresses on packets being sent and
connections to Web-mail services such as Hotmail, which includes blocking
access to Web proxies and configuring any local Web proxies to not allow
the test machine access to Web mail.
</p><p>
Having any machines other than the test machine and the router on the same
LAN may be a bad idea, as it may allow the test machines to be
used to attack the other machines. Having several security test machines
on the same physical network may be fun, though, as it would allow them to be used to
attack each other. If you have only one test machine, connecting it to
the router by a crossover Ethernet cable or a null-modem cable running PPP
probably is a good option.
</p><p>
Once the machine is connected and all firewalls are arranged, the difficult
work begins. You have to determine how to limit the access that is granted
and audit it as appropriate. For SE Linux, all that needs to be done is to
change the root entry in the users' file to <tt  >user root roles {
user_r };</tt>. Another option is to remove the root entry from the
database entirely, as the
default identity of user_u is permitted only the role user_r and gives the
extra restriction of preventing password changes. To change the password of
a nonprivileged account, the identity must match the user name.
</p><p>
The policy database then has to be recompiled and loaded into the kernel to
apply the change. After that, the root user has no significant access to the
system, so make sure you grant some other account administrative privileges
first.
</p><p>
The next time I set up a test machine, I plan to get someone with legal experience
to review the usage conditions to make sure they state what is permitted
in a clear and legally binding language. I will place the password on a
Web page that has the usage conditions and change it regularly, so people can't
get in without reading the conditions. Too many people were obviously not
reading the conditions, particularly regarding local DoS attacks
through fork bombs and using all available disk space.
</p><p>
If you run an SE Linux play machine, please let me know so I can
publicize it on my Web page.
</p><p>
I have been using the IRC channel #selinux on <a href="http://irc.debian.org" target="_self">irc.debian.org</a>
for supporting the play machine and for answering general SE Linux
questions.
I encourage anyone else who is running such a security test machine, whether
SE Linux or some other system, to join that channel to discuss it.
