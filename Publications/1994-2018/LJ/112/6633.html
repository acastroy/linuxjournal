The Trusted Computing Platform Alliance (TCPA,
<a href="http://www.trustedcomputing.org" target="_self">www.trustedcomputing.org</a>) has published open
specifications for a security chip and related
software interfaces. The TCPA chip is designed
to provide client machines with a minimal
but essential hardware base for client-side
security. It provides two important security
functions: secure storage of signature and
encryption keys and system software integrity
measurement. TCPA's secure storage can be used to
protect an individual's RSA authentication private
key or a loopback filesystem's master key from
theft or disclosure. TCPA's integrity measurement
can be used to detect software compromise, such
as a rooted kernel, and to lock down use of
protected keys and data if a compromise is found.
</p><p>
IBM is now shipping models of ThinkPad and desktop
machines with TCPA chips. IBM has published a set of open-source
tutorial code for TCPA, available at
<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/gsal/tcpa" target="_self">www.research.ibm.com/gsal/tcpa</a>. This tutorial
package is intended to help teach people about
TCPA and to introduce programming of the TCPA
chip under Linux.
</p><p>
In this article, we try to help you better
understand the TCPA specification and tutorial
package by introducing the fundamentals of TCPA,
describing the IBM open-source TCPA tutorial
package for Linux and explaining how you can use
TCPA to sign documents and store the key for
an encrypted loopback filesystem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22fc580.0x23f48c8"></a>The TCPA Chip</h2></div></div><p>
A TCPA security subsystem includes both hardware
and software components. Functions provided
by hardware are called TPM (trusted platform
module) functions; those provided by
software are TSS (trusted support services). From
a programmer's perspective, the IBM version of
the TPM (or TCPA chip) looks like Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="6633f1.jpg"></div><p>
The TPM includes five cryptographic functional
units. It has a hardware random number generator
(RNG), which provides a source of high-quality
random numbers for on-chip key generation, as well
as for application use. It has a hash unit (SHA-1)
and an associated hashing for message authentication calculator (HMAC). It also has the
ability to generate RSA keys of up to 2,048 bits
on the chip, based on random numbers supplied by
the RNG. Finally, it has an RSA engine that can perform
signatures, encryption and decryption.
The TPM does not do signature verification, as
this is not a sensitive operation and can be done more
easily and quickly with software.
</p><p>
The TPM stores three important keys in non-volatile
memory. The endorsement key is a 2,048-bit RSA
public and private key pair, which is created
randomly on the chip at manufacture time and
cannot be changed. The private key never leaves the
chip, while the public key is used for attestation
and for encryption of sensitive data sent
to the chip, as occurs during the TPM_TakeOwnership
command. Because this key is sensitive from a privacy
perspective, its use can be disabled
completely by the TPM owner.
</p><p>
The storage root key (SRK) is a 2,048-bit RSA key
pair. It is initially empty and is created as
part of the TPM_TakeOwnership command. This key
never leaves the chip. It is used to encrypt (wrap)
private keys for storage outside the TPM and to
decrypt them when they are loaded back into the
TPM. The SRK can be cleared by the system owner.
</p><p>
The Owner Authorization secret key is a 160-bit
secret shared with the owner of the TPM. The
owner loads it into the TPM as part of the
TPM_TakeOwnership command. This secret key is
used to authorize sensitive owner command requests.
</p><p>
The volatile memory section contains ten slots for
temporary storage of RSA key pairs. Any number
of wrapped keys can be stored externally and
loaded as needed into these slots for use. Although
loaded keys are considered volatile and are not
guaranteed to persist across power down, in the
case of the IBM chip version, keys normally do
persist and may need to be evicted to make room
for the loading of new ones.
</p><p>
The volatile memory section also contains 15
platform configuration registers (PCRs). These
registers contain 160-bit measurements (hashes)
of software integrity. During system boot,
measurements are taken of the BIOS, extension
BIOSes, MBR, GRUB bootstrap stages and any
designated files, such as the kernel. These
measurements are added to various PCRs.
The BIOS actively resets all PCR values at boot
time power-on. When a system resumes from a suspended
state, the BIOS tries to start the TPM in a
mode that restores saved PCR values. For this to
work, the TPM device driver must have issued a
TPM_SaveState command right before the chip was
suspended.
</p><p>
Volatile memory also is used to store two types
of handles. Key handles are used to give temporary
names to loaded keys, so subsequent commands
can indicate which key should be used, if multiple keys
are loaded. Key handles are cleared when the
respective key is evicted. Authorization session
handles are used to identify authorization state
data across multiple commands. Authorization
handles are created by TPM_OSAP and TPM_OIAP
authorization commands, and they must be cleared
with a TPM_Terminate_Handle command when no
longer needed.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22fc580.0x23f4d40"></a>
Enabling and Clearing the TPM</h2></div></div><p>
Before looking at these specific TPM commands, we
should cover one of the more mystifying aspects of
the TPM&mdash;how to get it started. Fortunately,
the BIOS is responsible for starting up and clearing
the TPM, so this really is not as complex as it
looks to be in the TPM specification. At power-on, the
TPM is activated but not started. The BIOS
then must issue a TPM_Startup command. This command
can do one of three things: deactivate
the TPM, start up the TPM with a reset of
the PCR registers or start up the TPM with
a restore of PCR values from their saved states
(as with a resume). If the BIOS deactivates the
TPM, it remains deactivated until the next power
cycle; no software command can reactivate
it. A startup with clearing of the PCRs is done at
boot time, so all PCR values are calculated
correctly during boot. The TPM device driver is
responsible for making a TPM_SaveState request at
suspend time to ensure that valid PCR values are
available at resume time.
</p><p>
The BIOS also is responsible for performing a
TPM_ForceClear if desired. The clear command
is a complete reset of the TPM, and it
unloads all keys and handles and clears
the SRK and owner authorization secret.
TPM_ForceClear requires proof of physical
presence, which normally is given by holding
down the Fn key (blue key at the bottom left)
when powering on the system.
</p><p>
The control of TPM deactivation and clearing
by the BIOS is set in the BIOS setup mode.
To get started with the TPM, then, hold down the Fn key
and press the Power-On button. When the BIOS screen appears, release Fn, and
press F1 to enter BIOS setup mode. Next, select Config&rarr;Security
System,
then select Enable and Clear entries.
These steps enable operation of the TPM and
clear the chip, so it is ready for us to
take ownership.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22fc580.0x23f4ef8"></a>
Talking to the TPM</h2></div></div><p>
The TPM device driver, tpm.o, is a loadable kernel
module that provides a character device interface to
the TPM chip. It is registered officially as Linux
major number 10, minor number 224. Applications
normally access it through the special file
/dev/tpm.
</p><p>
To send a command to the TPM, /dev/tpm is
opened for read/write, a command packet is written
and the response packet is read. The TPM can process
only one command at a time, so the entire request
must be sent and the entire response must be read before
another request can be made.
</p><p>
All command packets have a common structure:
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x22fc580.0x23f50b0"></a><p class="title"><b></b></p><table     summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>16-bit unsigned TAG</td><td>type of packet</td></tr><tr><td>32-bit unsigned Length</td><td>length of total packet</td></tr><tr><td>32-bit unsigned Ordinal</td><td>TPM command number</td></tr><tr><td>variable</td><td>command data</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
All response packets have a similar structure:
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x22fc580.0x23f5688"></a><p class="title"><b>
</b></p><table     summary="&#10;6633t2.qrk" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>16-bit unsigned TAG</td><td>type of packet</td></tr><tr><td>32-bit unsigned Length</td><td>length of total packet</td></tr><tr><td>32-bit unsigned Return</td><td>return code</td></tr><tr><td>variable</td><td>returned data</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>
All 16- and 32-bit values are in network byte
order (big endian) and must be converted to and
from host byte order. On writes to the TPM,
write exactly the number of bytes in the packet,
as indicated in the packet's total length field.
When reading the response, you should attempt to
read 4,096 bytes (the defined maximum TPM packet
size), and the return value of the read
indicates how many bytes are in the returned packet.
This should match the returned packet's
length field exactly. The return code is zero for a
successful command, and a positive value is
a specific error code.
</p><p>
A function for sending/receiving TPM packets can
look something like the following (error
handling omitted for clarity):

<pre     class="programlisting">

uint32_t TPM_Transmit(unsigned char *blob)
{
    int tpmfp, len;
    uint32_t size;

    tpmfp = open("/dev/tpm", O_RDWR);
    size = ntohl(*(uint32_t *)&amp;blob[2]);
    len = write(tpmfp, blob, size);
    len = read(tpmfp, blob, 4096);
    return(ntohl(*(uint32_t *)&amp;blob[6]));
}


</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22fc580.0x23ec5f8"></a>
Some Simple TPM Commands</h2></div></div><p>
Once the TPM is enabled and cleared through
the BIOS setup and the TPM device driver is loaded,
we can try some simple TPM commands.
The TCPA main specification details some 73
TPM commands. Fortunately, we can demonstrate
the desired signing and sealing functionality
in this tutorial with only 14 of these commands.
</p><p>
The simplest command is TPM_Reset,
a request to flush any existing authorization
handles. TPM_Reset is a nice command to test a
driver and library, as it is short, fixed and
should always succeed, returning a result code of
zero. Here is the example code for TPM_Reset:

<pre     class="programlisting">

uint32_t TPM_Reset()
{
    unsigned char blob[4096] = {
        0,193,     /*TPM_TAG_RQU_COMMAND*/
        0,0,0,10,  /* blob length, bytes */
        0,0,0,90}; /*TPM_ORD_Reset */
    return(TPM_Transmit(blob));
}


</pre>
</p><p>
It is important to size blob[] to allow the returned
TPM data to be up to the maximum allowed packet size
of 4,096 bytes.
</p><p>
The TPM_GetCapability command is another simple
function that can return several items of
information about a given TPM. It can return the
version of the current TPM, the total number of
key slots in the TPM (typically ten), the number
of loaded keys and their handles and the number
of PCR registers (typically 16). Here is the
example code for using TPM_GetCapability to read
the TPM version:

<pre     class="programlisting">

uint32_t TPM_GetCapability_Version()
{
    unsigned char blob[4096] = {
        0,193,     /* TPM_TAG_RQU_COMMAND */
        0,0,0,18,  /* blob length, bytes */
        0,0,0,101, /* TPM_ORD_GetCapability */
        0,0,0,6,   /* TCPA_CAP_VERSION */
        0,0,0,0};  /* no sub capability */
    return(TPM_Transmit(blob));
}

</pre>
</p><p>
TPM_PcrRead returns the 20 bytes (160 bits) of
a specified PCR register. It is useful to check
that any desired TPM measurements are being made
by the modified GRUB loader.
</p><p>
TPM_ReadPubek is used to read the TPM's fixed
public endorsement key (Pubek). Pubek initially must
be read so it can be used by the
owner to encrypt sensitive data in the
TPM_TakeOwnership command. Once ownership is
established, the owner typically disables
reading of the Pubek for privacy reasons; after that,
then this command fails.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22fc580.0x23ec968"></a>
TPM Authorization Protocols</h2></div></div><p>
Some TPM commands require authorization. Owner-related commands normally require authorization
based on knowledge of the owner authorization 160-bit secret. Similarly, the use of keys may require
authorization based on the key's authorization
secret. Normally, this is done in the form of a hash
of password, or PIN, applied to the key when it
is created.
</p><p>
The TPM supports two protocols for this
authorization: Object Independent Authorization
Protocol (OIAP) and Object Specific Authorization
Protocol (OSAP). Both protocols are similar in that
they create an authorization context with a handle
returned to the user, and they both use rolling
nonces. The main difference is OIAP creates
a long-term session with a new session secret key,
and it can be used across multiple objects within
a session. OSAP relates to a single object, such
as a given key. In the case of TPM_TakeOwnership,
OIAP must be used because the objects and secrets have
not yet been established. In most other cases,
either authorization protocol may be used.
</p><p>
TPM_OIAP and TPM_OSAP both create authorization
handles that should be terminated (freed)
when finished. This is done with the
TPM_Terminate_Handle command.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22fc580.0x23ecb20"></a>
TPM_TakeOwnership</h2></div></div><p>
We are ready to perform the essential
TPM_TakeOwnership. This command executes four
critical functions: it installs the owner-supplied
owner authorization secret, creates the SRK,
applies the owner-supplied SRK authorization
secret and, optionally, returns the Public
SRK portion to the owner. With the SRK available,
we now have a functional TPM and are able to
create and use signature and encryption keys.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22fc580.0x23ecc28"></a>
Creating and Using Keys</h2></div></div><p>
TPM_CreateWrapKey generates a new RSA key
on the chip, using the hardware RNG. A key
must be typed as being either for signing or for
encryption/decryption. The TPM does not allow a
signature key to encrypt or an encryption key
to sign, as this can lead to attacks. A key optionally may
be given a secret that it is required
to produce to use the key in the future. In addition, keys
can be wrapped to specified PCR values. If this is
done, both the authorization data
and specified PCR data must match to use the key. All keys must
have a parent key&mdash;it may be the SRK&mdash;that
is used to encrypt the private part of the key,
before the key structure is returned to the user.
The returned key data must be stored by the user
for future loading.
</p><p>
TPM_LoadKey is used to load a key into one of the
volatile key storage slots in the TPM. This command
requires the authorization password for the parent
key; once loaded, the TPM uses the parent
key to decrypt the loaded key's private data for
use. If the key has an authorization secret, it
is not needed to load the key, but it is required
for any subsequent command that tries to use
the key for encryption or signing.
</p><p>
Because a limited number of key slots are available in
the TPM, when a key is no longer needed, it must be
evicted to make the slot available for other keys.
</p><p>
The TPM_Sign command uses a loaded key to sign
presented data, normally the hash of the actual
data. TPM_Seal is used to perform RSA encryption
of data; it requires a loaded encryption key and
any authorization secret for that key. TPM_Seal
also may specify PCR values to be used in the seal.
If a future unseal is attempted without matching
PCR values, the unseal fails. TPM_Seal also
applies a used supplied data authorization value
(password) to the sealed data. Thus, to unseal
the data, the user may require the password for
the sealing key and for the data, and the PCR
values may have to match. TPM_Unseal performs
the corresponding unseal operation.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22fc580.0x23ece38"></a>
The TCPA Linux Tutorial Package</h2></div></div><p>
The IBM TCPA tutorial package provides source
code for five major components: device driver, libtcpa, examples, GRUB
patch and loopback patch.
</p><p>
The device driver code allows you to compile a
tpm.o loadable module for your kernel. The libtcpa
code provides easy-to-use C interfaces for the
application level TPM commands discussed in this
article. The example programs demonstrate how to
use libtcpa to do common actions, including
taking ownership, creating keys, loading keys,
signing, sealing and unsealing. The GRUB patch
is a source code patch to the GRUB bootloader. It
adds support for PCR measurement of grub itself
and of any designated files, such as the kernel.
The loopback patch is a source code patch to
the loopback driver and associated utilities.
This patch allows the loopback encryption key to
be stored in TPM sealed form and releases it only
if presented with the corresponding password
and only if the PCR values match. With this patch
installed, loopback mounting appears normal;
it asks for a password, but this password is used
to authorize only the unsealing of the actual
loopback key data.
</p><p>
So, what does the use of the TCPA chip for signing
and sealing/unsealing do for us? Our private
keys are created on the chip, and they never leave
the chip unless encrypted under a protected
public key. The use of the PCRs also can
protect our keys by refusing to authorize
their use if the system has not been booted in the
proper way, or if the integrity of measured files
has been compromised. Sealing a loopback key
similarly can protect against alternative booting
and compromised software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22fc580.0x23ecff0"></a>Next Steps</h2></div></div><p>
The IBM TCPA tutorial package is not a complete
TSS implementation, as it was mainly intended to
make TCPA easier to understand. It does not do TPM
resource management for handles and loaded keys nor
does it give access to the TPM's key backup
and migration facilities. These are topics for
future development and articles.
