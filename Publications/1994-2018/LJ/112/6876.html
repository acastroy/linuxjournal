Authenticate with LDAP</i></h3></div><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Mick Bauer</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #112, August 2003</div></div><div><p>
The directory server is running, so now it's time to configure crypto
and add some users.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2731580.0x2829240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we did some of the preliminary work in setting up an
OpenLDAP server. We installed the base, server and, where applicable,
client packages for OpenLDAP, and we entered some basic configuration
information into the file /etc/openldap/slapd.conf (slapd is
OpenLDAP's server d&aelig;mon).
</p><p>
This month, we configure TLS encryption, start
the d&aelig;mon and begin building an LDAP database. We
won't have a finished authentication server yet,
but we'll be pretty close. Next month, in this
series' third and final installment, we'll get
there.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2731580.0x28293a0"></a>
TLS for Secure LDAP Transactions</h2></div></div><p>
By default, OpenLDAP transactions over networks are conducted in
clear text. If you're using OpenLDAP, for example, as a centralized
address book server on a trusted network, that's probably fine. But if
you're using it to authenticate users, regardless of whether the networks
involved are trusted, you really ought to encrypt your LDAP
communications to protect your users' passwords from eavesdroppers.
</p><p>
The LDAP v.3 protocol, support for which was
introduced in OpenLDAP 2.0, provides encryption
in the form of Transport Layer Security (TLS),
the same mechanism used by web browsers and mail
transport agents. TLS is the successor to SSL,
the Secure Sockets Layer. All you need to do
to take advantage of this is create a server
certificate on your LDAP server; add a couple
more lines to /etc/openldap/slapd.conf, and optionally, tweak slapd's
startup options.
</p><p>
To generate a server certificate, you need OpenSSL. This already should
be present on your system, because binary OpenLDAP packages depend
on OpenSSL.
</p><p>
What sort of certificate you should use as your
LDAP certificate actually is a fairly subtle
question. Will the server need a certificate that
has been signed by some other certificate authority (CA),
such as Thawte or VeriSign? That is, will your LDAP
clients need to see an externally verifiable
certificate when connecting to your server? Or,
will your organization be its own
CA? If so, will the LDAP server also act
as your local CA, issuing and signing both its
own and other hosts' and users' certificates?
</p><p>
If your needs match any of those scenarios,
you'll need to do a bit more work than I'm able
to describe here. Suffice it to say that the
certificate slapd uses can't have a password
associated with it&mdash;its key can't be
DES-encrypted&mdash;so a self-signed certificate,
though technically a CA certificate, shouldn't
be used as an actual CA certificate for
signing other certificates. If you want to use
your LDAP server as a real CA, you'll need
to create two keys, a password-protected
CA key and a password-free slapd key. Vincent
Danen's article &ldquo;Using OpenLDAP for Authentication&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.mandrakesecure.net/en/docs/ldap-auth.php" target="_self">www.mandrakesecure.net/en/docs/ldap-auth.php</a>)
discusses this.
</p><p>
For many if not most readers, it will be enough to create a self-generated
TLS-only certificate to be used by slapd and slapd alone. If you
don't care about being a CA and you don't
need your LDAP clients to be able to verify the server certificate's
authenticity via some third party, you can create your certificate like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">

bash-$&gt; openssl req -new -x509 -nodes \
-out slapdcert.pem -keyout slapdkey.pem \
-days 365
Using configuration from /usr/share/ssl/openssl.cnf
Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
....++++++
.........++++++
writing new private key to 'slapdkey.pem'


</pre>
</p><p>
On this command line I told OpenSSL to
generate a new X.509 certificate, without password
protection, with the certificate (public key)
stored in the current working directory in the
file slapdcert.pem, and the private key stored
in the file slapdkey.pem, with a lifetime
of 365 days,
</p><p>
After issuing this command, you will be prompted for
distinguished name information for the new
certificate and key. For OpenLDAP's purposes, the
most important field here is the common name.
This must be set to your LDAP server's DNS
name, which is the name your LDAP clients will see
associated with this certificate. If your LDAP
server's IP address, for example, reverse resolves
to bonzo.lamemoviesfromthepast.com but its
server certificate shows a CN of bonzo.lm.com,
LDAP clients will reject the certificate and
therefore will be unable to negotiate TLS connections
(with unpredictable results, depending on
your client software).
</p><p>
Once you've got certificate and key files, copy
them into /etc/openldap if you weren't
already in that directory when you created
them. Make sure that both of these are owned by
ldap or whatever user your Linux distribution
runs slapd as, Red Hat and SuSE use ldap, and
that your key file has very strict permissions,
such as <tt  >-r--------</tt>. Your certificate file
may, however, be world-readable, because this
contains a public key.
</p><p>
It's possible to specify the same filename after both the
-out and -keyout options, resulting in both the certificate and
private key being stored in a single file. This is fine if you don't
intend to share the certificate. Keeping the two separate, however,
allows you to distribute the server certificate while still keeping the
server (private) key secret.
</p><p>
Naturally, it isn't enough to have certificate/key
files in place; you need to tell slapd to use
them. As with most slapd configuration,
this happens in /etc/openldap/slapd.conf. Listing 1 shows the sample slapd.conf entries from last month's
column (in case you've forgotten what we covered), plus three
additional ones: TLSCipherSuite, TLSCertificateFile
and TLSCertificateKeyFile.
</p><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 1. Customized Part of /etc/openldap/slapd.conf</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">

suffix          "dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org"

TLSCertificateFile      /etc/openldap/slapdcert.pem
TLSCertificateKeyFile   /etc/openldap/slapdkey.pem

</pre></div><p>
TLSCipherSuite specifies a list of OpenSSL ciphers from which
slapd will choose when negotiating TLS connections, in decreasing order
of preference. To see which ciphers are supported by your local OpenSSL
installation, issue this command:
</p><pre     class="programlisting">
openssl ciphers -v ALL
</pre><p>
In addition to those specific ciphers, you
can use any of the wild cards supported by
OpenSSL, which allow you to specify multiple
ciphers with a single word. For example, in
Listing 1 TLSCipherSuite is set to
HIGH:MEDIUM:+SSLv2; as it happens, HIGH,
MEDIUM and +SSLv2 all are wild cards.
</p><p>
HIGH means &ldquo;all ciphers using key lengths greater
than 128 bits&rdquo;; MEDIUM is short for &ldquo;all ciphers
using key lengths equal to 128 bits&rdquo;, and +SSLv2
means &ldquo;all ciphers specified in the SSL protocol,
version 2, regardless of key strength&rdquo;. For a
complete explanation of OpenSSL ciphers, including
all supported wild cards, see the ciphers(1)
man page.
</p><p>
TLSCertificateFile and TLSCertificateKeyFile are more
obvious. They specify the paths to your certificate file and private key
file, respectively. If both certificate and key are combined in a single
file, you can specify the same path for both parameters.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2731580.0x2829df0"></a>slapd Startup Options</h2></div></div><p>
We've done everything we need (on the server
end) for TLS encryption to work. Only one detail to consider
remains. Should we force the
use of TLS for all LDAP requests from the network
or keep it optional?
</p><p>
By default, slapd listens for LDAP connections on TCP port 389
and accepts either clear text or TLS-encrypted connections on that
port. However, if you're using LDAP for authentication, you probably
don't want to make TLS optional. A better approach in that case is to
have slapd listen for clear text-only LDAP connections on TCP 389 on
the loopback interface only and have slapd listen for TLS-enabled
(ldaps) connections on TCP 636 (the standard port for ldaps) for all
other local addresses.
</p><p>
This behavior is controlled by slapd's startup option -h, used to specify the URLs to which slapd will respond. For
example, <tt  >slapd -h ldap://127.0.0.1/ ldaps:///</tt> tells slapd to
listen on the loopback address (127.0.0.1) for ldap connections to the
default ldap port (TCP 389) and to listen on all local addresses for
ldaps connections to the default ldaps port (TCP 636).
</p><p>
If you run Red Hat 7.3 or later, this actually is the default
behavior: /etc/init.d/ldap checks /etc/openldap/slapd.conf
for TLS configuration information and if it finds it, sets the
-h option exactly like the one in the previous paragraph's
example. If you run SuSE 8.1 or later, you can achieve the same
thing by editing /etc/sysconfig/openldap such that the
value for OPENLDAP_START_LDAPS is yes, and then editing
/etc/init.d/openldap to set the value for SLAPD_URLS
to ldap://127.0.0.1. This variable is defined early in the script,
with a default value of ldap:///.
</p><p>
Other Linux distributions may have different ways
of passing startup options like -h to slapd,
but hopefully by now you get the idea and can
figure out how to make slapd's listening ports
work the way you want.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2731580.0x282a108"></a>Testing</h2></div></div><p>
So, does our TLS-enabled LDAP server actually work? A quick local
test will tell us. First, start LDAP:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-$ /etc/init.d/ldap start
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, use the ldapsearch command to do a simple query via loopback:

<pre     class="programlisting">

bash-$ ldapsearch -x -H ldaps://localhost/ \
-b 'dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org' '(objectclass=*)'

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2731580.0x282a318"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Naturally, your own LDAP server will have a different base DN than
dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org. If you prefer, you can run this last command
from a remote host, specifying the LDAP server's name or IP address in
place of localhost in the -h option. If the LDAP server returns a dump of
the LDAP database, which actually is
empty at this point, followed by the string <tt  >result: 0
Success</tt>, your test has succeeded.
</p><p>
If you get an error about an invalid
certificate, try adding this line to your client system's
/etc/openldap/ldap.conf file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
TLS_REQCERT	allow
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2731580.0x282a528"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This allows your OpenLDAP or OpenLDAP-based client software (for example,
gq) to accept self-signed server certificates.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2731580.0x282a630"></a>LDAP Schema</h2></div></div><p>
You're almost ready to start populating the LDAP database. On the one
hand, tools like gq and ldapbrowser can reduce the ugliness and
toil of LDAP data entry and administration greatly. But to get to the point where
these tools can be used, you first have to settle on a combination of
LDAP schema, and this is where things can get unpleasant.
</p><p>
For purposes of this discussion, two types of LDAP data
matter, attributes and object classes. Attributes are the things that
make up a record. A user's phone number, e-mail address, nicknames and so
on are all attributes. You can use as many or as few attributes in
your LDAP database as you like. You even can invent your own. But for
a record to contain a given attribute, that record must be associated
with the proper object class.
</p><p>
An object class describes the type of record you're trying to build.
It defines which attributes are mandatory for each record and which
attributes are optional. You might think, &ldquo;that's easy, then I
simply need to choose an object type that provides the group of attributes
I want to store for my users and associate each user record with that
object class.&rdquo; If you thought that, you'd be only partly right.
</p><p>
In practice, you'll probably want to use attributes from a variety
of object classes. &ldquo;Well, fine&rdquo;, you think, &ldquo;I'll just specify
multiple object classes in each user record and get my full
complement of attributes <span   class="foreignphrase"><i>&agrave; la carte</i></span>.
Whatever.&rdquo; Right again, but there's more to it than that. Chances are the
object classes that provide the attributes you need are spread across a
number of schema files (these are text files, each of which contains a
list of attributes and the object classes that reference them). So, even
before you can begin composing your user records, each containing a stack
of object class statements and a bigger stack of attribute settings,
first you need to make sure /etc/openldap/slapd.conf contains
include statements for all the schema files you need, usually present
in /etc/openldap/schema.
</p><p>
For example, suppose that because we're going to use our sample LDAP server for
authentication, we want to make sure that no matter what, we're able to
specify the attributes userid and userPassword. Doing
a quick <tt  >grep</tt> of the files in /etc/openldap/schema shows that
uid appears in the file inetorgperson.schema in the MAY list
(of allowed attributes) for the object class inetOrgPerson. This has
two ramifications. First, /etc/openldap/slapd.conf needs to contain this line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
include   /etc/openldap/schema/inetorgperson.schema
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2731580.0x282aaa8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Second, whenever I create a user record, I need to make sure that an
<tt  >objectclass: inetOrgPerson</tt> statement is present.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2731580.0x282ac08"></a>Creating and Adding User Records</h2></div></div><p>
So, how do you create user records? Ideally, with
the GUI of your choice. Last month I mentioned
gq, which is a standard package in many distros;
another excellent tool is ldapbrowser, available
at <a href="http://www.iit.edu/~gawojar/ldap" target="_self">www.iit.edu/~gawojar/ldap</a>.
Initially, however, you'll probably want to add at least your
organizational entry manually, by creating an ldif file and writing
it to the database via the ldapadd command.
An ldif file is a text file containing a list of attribute/object class
declarations, one per line; a simple one follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
dn: dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org
objectclass: top
objectclass: organization
o: Wiremonkeys of St. Paul
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2731580.0x2c23010"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Here, we're defining the organization wiremonkeys.org. We specify its
distinguished name, associate it with the object classes' top (mandatory
for all records) and organization and specify the organization's name
(Wiremonkeys of St. Paul), which is the only mandatory attribute for
these two object classes.
</p><p>
To write this record to the database, issue this command:

<pre     class="programlisting">

bash-$ ldapadd -x -H ldaps://localhost/ \
-D "cn=ldapguy,dc=wiremonkeys,dc=org" \
-W -f wiremonkeys_init.ldif

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2731580.0x2c231c8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As with most OpenLDAP commands, -x specifies simple password
authentication, -H specifies the LDAP server's URL, -D
specifies the DN of the administrator account and -W causes a prompt for
the administrator's password. The -f option
specifies the path to our ldif file.
</p><p>
Confused yet? I've packed a lot of information
into this month's column, but our LDAP server is
very nearly done. To finish yours without waiting
for next month, see the OpenLDAP Administrator's
Guide at <a href="http://www.openldap.org/doc" target="_self">www.openldap.org/doc</a> for more
information about TLS, startup flags, schema
and ldif files.
