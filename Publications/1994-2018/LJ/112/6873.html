What we're learning from Linux's growing silent majority.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb07580.0xbff240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Here at <i  >Linux Journal</i> we've been deeply involved in the Linux community
ever since Phil Hughes started the magazine back in 1994 when Linux
was turning 1.0. Through that whole time, we've served two different
overlapping communities of interest&mdash;one political, the other
practical. The political community cares about issues and the characters
who drive them. The practical community cares about the nuts-and-bolts
challenges of putting Linux to work.
</p><p>
During the past year, we've seen a growing split between the two,
because the practical penguin population has been snowballing. And, on
the whole, newborn practical penguins are joining the species for
practical purposes. They don't care much about licensing, software
patents or threatening legislation. To
them, free software means free-as-in-beer. The free-as-in-speech stuff
is fine, but it's not their issue.
</p><p>
What practical penguins care about is getting stuff done. If they're
shucking off Microsoft, it's mostly because other stuff is cheaper, does
a better job or is a smaller pain in the butt. The fact that it's free,
and seems to grow wild in nature, makes Linux, along with the free stuff
that runs on it, highly appealing. The fact that programmers get to keep
and share their improvements to code is another bonus.
</p><p>
Of course, many practical penguins are political ones, too. But the
political penguin percentage is getting smaller, even though their
absolute numbers are getting larger.
</p><p>
Sound familiar? This is very much like what happened to the Internet in
the mid-90s. Prior to that time, the Net was the province of academics
and hackers working for organizations privileged to have Net
connections. Politics and utility were closely connected. What made the
Net important was also what made it handy. At a certain point, however,
the appeal got turned around. What made it handy made it important. And
as it became handier for more and more people, the percentage of people who
continued to care about its founding virtues grew smaller. Today
a noisy minority still exists that loves the Net's founding virtues and
inveighs tirelessly on its behalf. That's why I wrote &ldquo;World of
Ends&rdquo;
(<a href="http://worldofends.com" target="_self">worldofends.com</a>) with David Weinberger, for example.
But most people who use the Net really don't
care. They only like what the Net does.
</p><p>
That's where we're going with Linux. It's the somewhat unexpected yet
entirely predictable consequence of World Domination. When Linux becomes
the default operating system&mdash;ubiquitous, or close enough&mdash;it
still will
be important for some of us to care about why it got that way and
why its founding virtues remain as operative as ever. But as a
percentage of the whole community, that &ldquo;some&rdquo; will be a progressively
smaller group, even if they grow in absolute numbers. The only problem
is the practical majority still is mostly a silent one, while the
political minority still is widely heard. This creates distortions in
the press, which often treats Linux as a political cause rather than a
market effect. It also denies the political voices much of the
validation they deserve. Unfortunately, the silence is likely to persist for a while. Linux is
long past the Not Going Away stage, but still a long way from World
Domination.
</p><p>
So, I've been making it my job to watch what the practical penguins have
been up to and to talk to as many as I can. I outlined my first
findings last month in &ldquo;How Linux Makes Smart Companies
Smarter&rdquo;. Since
then I've condensed my conclusions to a few key points:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Linux is a project, not a product. So
are the other members of the
LAMP suite: Apache, MySQL, Perl, Python, PHP and PostgreSQL.
</p></li><li><p>
Free software
and open source are ways that the demand side supplies itself. Call
this DIY-IT, or Do It Yourself Information Technology. In some cases,
DIY-IT is so well developed that customers hardly need vendors at all.
</p></li><li><p>
DIY-IT is causing a shift in market power from
supply to demand.
</p></li><li><p>
Clueless vendors fight this shift. Smart vendors learn from smart
customers, often by working on the same development projects.
</p></li><li><p>
IBM and Oracle are two standout examples of suppliers who are hip
to the smart stuff happening on the demand sides of their markets&mdash;largely because it's happening inside their companies as well.
</p></li><li><p>
This shift in power, and in the way clues are passed among
practitioners, is turning the software industry into something
very much like the construction industry, which also has
architects, designers, builders, tools, platforms, frameworks, a
hearty DIY tradition, project-based work and open-source know-how.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Figure 1 presents the old view of the software marketplace. Vendors had
a controlling position, because they supplied the goods&mdash;and the
expertise to go with them. This is what made 90% gross profit margins
not only possible, but standard.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6873f1.large.jpg"><img src="6873f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Old View of the Software Marketplace
</p></div></div><p>
Figure 2 shows how the new marketplace looks. Here the demand
side&mdash;the customer&mdash;is in a position to supply itself. It
still buys goods from vendors. In fact, smart vendors' goods are improved
by participation in the same development community as their customers.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="6873f2.large.jpg"><img src="6873f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The New Marketplace
</p></div></div><p>
As the market continues to mature, the open-source development community
will come to be understood as a collection of know-how. In a mature
industry like construction, this community includes everyone who
participates expertly in the industry. When that happens in the software
industry, topics like patents and licensing will acquire more confined
meanings than they have today. We won't need patents on &ldquo;business
methods&rdquo;, and most of us won't need licenses to tell us it's good to
share what we know. We'll do what comes naturally, which is what free software
and open-source licenses predicted in the first place.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the political remains as important as it ever was. Let's
remember, if it weren't for the political penguins who got the snowball
rolling, the practical penguin movement never would have picked up its
mass and momentum.
