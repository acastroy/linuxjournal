Is Linux accessible? In other words, how well does
Linux work for persons with disabilities? The
answer today depends, in great degree, on which
disability we're talking about. However, several
factors have begun driving Linux to become a
friendlier environment for users who are persons
with disabilities.
</p><p>
Perhaps the most fundamental factor spurring
Linux toward a more cohesive response to the
accessibility challenge is the Linux
ethos itself. The communitarian values that
undergird free and open-source software simply
cannot tolerate the notion that Linux should
exclude anyone. Doesn't everyone have the right to
run the program? Isn't everyone free to study and
improve the source? It goes against the grain
to leave anyone out simply because they can't
read text on a video display or press both the
meta key and F1 simultaneously. Linux always has
valued and encouraged active participation from its
community of users. We pride ourselves that quality
contributions, whether code or documentation,
float to the top and become incorporated in the
next release. And, indeed, much in Linux
exemplifies accessibility. Unfortunately, it
is generally incidental accessibility&mdash;a by-product
of the fact that Linux is deeply rooted in ASCII
on the one hand, and on Linux's stellar ability to
accept input from most any kind of device on the
other. Not that developers intentionally
would exclude support for accessibility&mdash;it just hasn't
been a design criterion in the code review process.
</p><p>
Another potent contributory factor is the emergence
of laws and policies giving preferences to
software and systems that are accessible. Chief
among the examples of such factors is the legal
mandate in the US government procurement known as
Section 508. This recently strengthened US law
requires the US government to procure accessible
&ldquo;electronic and information technology&rdquo; for use in
the federal workplace and in systems that provide
information and services electronically to the
public if accessible technology is commercially
available. Section 508 has expanded
interest in accessibility greatly simply because
the US government is a big IT customer,
currently spending about $40 billion annually on
technology&mdash;a number expected to grow by 50% in
merely five years. Clearly, most vendors that bundle
Linux products and services might find Uncle Sam
a customer to court. Coupled with the high esteem
Linux people have for Linux communitarian values,
it rankles one to think that Linux itself might,
just might, not measure up against this social
performance yardstick.
</p><p>
Over the past few years several developers,
funded principally by Sun Microsystems, but also
by IBM, Red Hat and Ximian, among others, systematically have been
putting the new GNOME 2.0 desktop
accessibility framework together. Frankly, it
is hard to believe this would have happened had
it not been for Section 508, but the benefits
of these efforts will extend well beyond the
US. The GNOME Accessibility web page (<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gap" target="_self">developer.gnome.org/projects/gap</a>) is
possibly the best current source of information, in
a Linux context, of what constitutes accessibility
and how it can be achieved.
</p><p>
However, we might summarize accessibility as
an I/O issue. The fundamental problem, though
varied and complex in its myriad permutations,
is simple. For every way by which a computer can
accept input from a human user, there is someone
who can't do things that way. Likewise, for every
output modality intended for human consumption,
there are users who cannot accept that particular
medium as input. So, the challenge, the subject
of articles to come, is simply how we get this
intrinsically binary instrument to accept input
from whatever device might be needed. And, how
do we reformat and re-purpose output to encompass
the rest of the user base?
</p><p>
The ethical imperative is clear. The software
commons must be for everyone if it is to be a true
commons. Even those whose software isn't directly
related to providing interface support to users
with disabilities must help, at some point and
in some manner, to make their applications work
for the widest possible user base. It is indeed
possible this demand will prove disruptive in some
areas. For the most part, however, it should prove
minimally invasive, simply because of the socketed
nature of Linux. Clearly, much of the work will
be performed by specialists, because there is a
good deal of specialized knowledge involved in
getting solutions that work well. Ultimately,
of course, the various communities of users with
disabilities will determine for themselves how to
do things. But, what they will want to do are the
same things the rest of us want to do&mdash;which takes
us back full circle to the communitarian ethos.
