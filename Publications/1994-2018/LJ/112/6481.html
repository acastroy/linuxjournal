When used correctly, encrypted filesystems
can be an effective way to protect sensitive data stored on a
computer. Standard encryption packages, such as the GNU Privacy Guard
(GPG), are good for encrypting e-mail. They are not as convenient,
however, for encrypting files one wishes to read or modify many times
throughout the files' lifetimes.
</p><p>
Unlike GPG, an encrypted filesystem is transparent to users. There is
no hassle of manually decrypting a file before reading it or encrypting
it again after modifying it. Potential user forgetfulness also is
mitigated. After introducing some encrypted filesystems available
for Linux, this article explains how to create an encrypted home
directory that is automatically mounted at login time and unmounted at
logout. Finally, this article introduces some concepts that demonstrate
the dangers of improperly implemented encryption techniques.
</p><p>
Why would one want to encrypt the data stored on a computer?
Isn't protecting sensitive data what filesystem permissions
are for? Although useful, filesystem permissions quickly lose their
effectiveness when an attacker has complete control of the storage medium
the permissions are used to protect. For example, if someone steals my
Linux laptop, an Apple iBook, its filesystems permissions are of little use
against the thief who can simply boot from a diabolical CD-ROM. The same
is true if I send my laptop to Apple for repairs. A dishonest employee
conceivably could read my files. Correctly encrypting the files on a
computer is a safe form of protection, because the process does not depend
on the integrity of the operating system after the encryption takes place.
</p><p>
I have chosen to encrypt only the home directories on my iBook.
Encrypting the entire filesystem, starting with root, was not acceptable
in my case due to performance penalties and other factors. Information on
implementing this technique can be found on the Internet&mdash;it requires
using Linux's initial ramdisk capability. In my experiences with an
x86-based system, the encryption technique I chose is around 50% slower
than a non-encrypted XFS filesystem when writing to disk using buffered
I/O. Encrypting only home directories obviously leaves many files,
such as system logs, as plain text, but these were not significantly
sensitive in my case. Encrypting only home directories was a sensible
compromise for me.
</p><p>
Linux supports a few options for encrypting filesystems. Systems
such as the Transparent Cryptographic File System provide an encrypted
extension to NFS-served ext2 volumes. Other filesystems contain integrated
cryptography in their design for local use. For my application, the best
solution seemed to be the concept of loopback encrypted filesystems.
As you will see, loopback encryption can be used to encrypt any filesystem
type supported by Linux, including the proven ext2, XFS and ReiserFS.
</p><p>
Linux loopback filesystem support simply allows a user to mount
an ordinary file as if it were a device, such as /dev/hda1. This
traditionally is useful for doing things like mounting a CD-ROM filesystem
image to populate and test before burning it to CD-R media or distributing
bootable floppy disk images. Herbert Valerio Riedel's GNU/Linux
Cryptographic API (CryptoAPI) and util-linux patches add support for
mounting encrypted filesystem images to the loopback driver.
</p><p>
Before delving into the details of loopback encrypted filesystems,
let's take a look at how to create and mount a vanilla loopback
filesystem. First, create a file to contain the filesystem. This example
creates a file large enough to host a 20MB filesystem:
</p><pre     class="screen">
dd if=/dev/zero of=plaintext.img bs=1M count=20
</pre><p>
Second, associate the newly created file with a loopback device:
</p><pre     class="screen">
losetup /dev/loop0 plaintext.img
</pre><p>
Next, create a filesystem within the file, using the newly associated
loop device:
</p><pre     class="screen">
mkfs -t ext2 /dev/loop0
</pre><p>
Finally, mount the filesystem and use it as if it were any other
mounted volume:
</p><pre     class="screen">
mount /dev/loop0 <span   class="emphasis"><em>mount point</em></span>
</pre><p>
Now, let us move on to the encrypted case. In order to use loopback
encrypted filesystems, the kernel must support them. Most distributions
do not include this functionality, so a custom-built kernel probably
is necessary. A cryptographic API package similar to the one I use is
being merged into the mainstream 2.5 kernel. However, for the stable
2.4 tree, the GNU/Linux CryptoAPI patches are necessary and available at
<a href="http://www.kerneli.org" target="_self">www.kerneli.org</a>. Once you apply the patch-int and loop-hvr
patches, Cryptographic options should be available when you configure
your kernel. The following options must be enabled:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
cryptographic API support (CONFIG_CRYPTO)
</p></li><li><p>
generic loop cryptographic filter (CONFIG_CRYPTOLOOP)
</p></li><li><p>
cryptographic ciphers (CONFIG_CIPHERS)
</p></li></ul></div><p>
You have to enable at least one cipher as
well. Remember which cipher you choose. I chose AES, originally called
Rijndael, and use AES in my examples.
</p><p>
Build and install the newly configured kernel. All of the kernel's
encryption code may be compiled as modules. If you choose to build kernel
modules, don't forget to insert them before you try to use their
functionality. It also is necessary to patch util-linux, compile the
tools and install them. The relevant util-linux patch is available at
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hvr/util-linux-patch-int" target="_self">www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hvr/util-linux-patch-int</a>.
You should find that you end up with modified mount and losetup commands.
</p><p>
Now we are ready to create a loopback encrypted filesystem using a
process similar to that which we used to create a vanilla loopback
filesystem. First, in order to make it difficult to differentiate between
encrypted blocks and unused disk space, the file that will hold the
loopback filesystem is created using /dev/urandom instead of /dev/zero:
</p><pre     class="screen">
dd if=/dev/urandom of=ciphertext.img bs=1M count=20
</pre><p>
After creating the host file, it must be temporarily associated with a
loopback device, as before. This time, however, we must tell losetup that
the loopback device is to be encrypted, in this case with the AES cipher:
</p><pre     class="screen">
losetup -e aes /dev/loop0 ciphertext.img
</pre><p>
Enter the password and possibly&mdash;depending on the cipher you
decided to use&mdash;the key size you wish to use for the volume when
prompted by losetup.
</p><p>
Creating the filesystem is done in a manner identical to that for
creating a vanilla loopback device. The encryption was set up in the
previous step and is now handled by the loopback driver:
</p><pre     class="screen">
mkfs -t ext2 /dev/loop0
</pre><p>
In addition to modifying losetup, the util-linux patch also makes
the mount command crypto-aware. Mounting an encrypted loopback volume
is a simple process, given the correct command parameters:
</p><pre     class="screen">
mount -o loop,encryption=aes ciphertext.img \
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mount point</em></span>
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ff0580.0x20e8f50"></a></h2></div></div><p><b  >
mount</b> prompts you for a password and possibly for a key size.
</p><p>
Now that you understand how to mount and unmount encrypted loopback
filesystems manually, an introduction to pam_mount is appropriate.
pam_mount is a PAM module that simplifies the management of volumes
and should be mounted when a user logs in to a system. It can handle
mounting things like Samba-hosted volumes, Novell-hosted volumes
and encrypted filesystems. The original author of pam_mount is Elvis
Pftzenreuter. Mukesh Agrawal wrote the patch that first added
support for loopback encrypted volumes. The author of this article now
maintains pam_mount, which is available at <a href="http://www.flyn.org" target="_self">www.flyn.org</a>.
</p><p>
Instead of having to mount encrypted volumes manually, a system
administrator can configure pam_mount to mount and unmount the volumes
automatically when users log on and off. This can be configured so the
system password also unlocks the encrypted volume, essentially creating
a completely transparent encrypted volume.
</p><p>
pam_mount can employ three different techniques to unlock an encrypted
volume. The first technique is rather boring. When the encrypted
volume's key is unrelated to the system's login password,
pam_mount simply prompts users for the key to their encrypted volume. In
order to use this technique on a system, pam_mount.so and pmhelper
must be installed and configured. The standard ./configure, make and
make install commands build and install pam_mount's binaries and
configuration file.
</p><p>
You should find the stock pam_mount.conf in /etc/security. Inspect and
tailor it to your own system. The stock pam_mount.conf file is well
documented. The most important change necessary is to add definitions
for the volumes that should be mounted to the end of the file. The
following is the definition format for encrypted loopback filesystems,
as documented in the stock file:
</p><pre     class="screen">
volume <span   class="emphasis"><em>user</em></span> local <span   class="emphasis"><em>ignored</em></span>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>loopback file</em></span>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mount point</em></span> <span   class="emphasis"><em>mount options</em></span>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fs
key cipher</em></span>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>fs key path</em></span>
</pre><p>
Here is an example that mounts an AES-encrypted loopback filesystem
hosted by /home/mike.img at /home/mike when Mike logs on:
</p><pre     class="screen">
volume mike local - /home/mike.img /home/mike
loop,user,exec,encryption=aes,keybits=256 - -
</pre><p>
Next, add the lines <tt  >auth required pam_mount.so
try_first_pass</tt> and <tt  >session required pam_mount.so
try_first_pass</tt> to the configuration files of the PAM-supporting
services you want to support loopback encrypted filesystems. As an
example, here is the /etc/pam.d/login file from my laptop:
</p><pre     class="screen">
auth       requisite  pam_securetty.so
auth       requisite  pam_nologin.so
auth       required   pam_env.so
auth       required   pam_unix.so nullok
account    required   pam_access.so
account    required   pam_unix.so
session    required   pam_unix.so
session    optional   pam_lastlog.so
session    optional   pam_motd.so
session    optional   pam_mail.so standard noenv
password   required   pam_unix.so nullok obscure \
                      min=4 max=8 md5
auth       required   pam_mount.so try_first_pass
session	   required   pam_mount.so try_first_pass
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ff0580.0x20e9738"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Finally, create the user's loopback encrypted filesystem using
the steps listed in the introduction to encrypted loopback filesystems.
</p><p>
The second technique for pam_mount to unlock a volume is more
convenient for users. If, when creating the encrypted volume using the
same method as the first technique, a user specifies his or her login
password as the volume key, then pam_mount unlocks the volume using the
same password the user enters to login.
</p><p>
The third technique is the most flexible and requires a more sophisticated
description. Here are a few terms to help you understand how this
technique works:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
sk: system key, the key or password used to log
in to the system.
</p></li><li><p>
fsk: filesystem key, the key that allows you to
use the filesystem you want pam_mount to mount for you.
</p></li><li><p>
E and D: an OpenSSL-supported synchronous
encryption/decryption algorithm, bf-ecb, for example.
</p></li><li><p>
efsk: encrypted filesystem key, efsk = E_sk
(fsk), stored somewhere on the local filesystem (that is, /home/user.key).
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ff0580.0x20e9c08"></a></h2></div></div><p>
pam_mount reads efsk from the local filesystem, performs <tt  >fsk =
D_sk (efsk)</tt> and uses <tt  >fsk</tt> to mount the filesystem. This technique has the
advantage of allowing users to change their login passwords without having
to re-encrypt their home directories using this new key. If the login
password is changed, simply regenerate efsk (that is, /home/user.key)
using <tt  >efsk = E_newsk (D_oldsk (efsk))</tt>. A script named passwdehd
is included in pam_mount to do this for you.
</p><p>
To implement this third technique, begin by creating the file to host
the encrypted filesystem (as before):
</p><pre     class="screen">
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/home/user.img \
bs=1M count=<span   class="emphasis"><em>image size in MB</em></span>
</pre><p>
Then, create a file (efsk) containing the volume's password (fsk)
using /dev/urandom, encrypted using the user's login password as
the key:
</p><pre     class="screen">
dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1c count=<span   class="emphasis"><em>keysize / 8</em></span> | \
openssl enc -bf-ecb &gt; /home/user.key
</pre><p>
Next, create an encrypted loopback filesystem. The filesystem's
key should be fsk (generated using /dev/urandom, encrypted and stored
as /home/user.key in step 2).
</p><pre     class="screen">
openssl enc -d -bf-ecb -in /home/user.key | \
losetup  -e aes -k <span   class="emphasis"><em>keysize</em></span> -p0 /dev/loop0 \
/home/user.img
mkfs -t ext2 /dev/loop0
umount /dev/loop0
losetup -d /dev/loop0
</pre><p>
Finally, in pam_mount.conf, set the fs key cipher variable to the
cipher used to encrypt fsk, in this case bf-ecb, and set the fs key path
variable to efsk's path, in this case, /home/user.key.
</p><p>
In his definitive text, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Applied Cryptography</em></span>, Bruce Schneier
states, &ldquo;Software encryption is scary.&rdquo; What he means
is, it is difficult to design truly secure encryption software for
computers running general-purpose operating systems such as Linux.
For example, modern operating systems can swap memory to disk at any
time, and this memory could contain plain text or encryption keys.
An encrypted volume is useless if its key has been written to disk
by the operating system. One way to reduce the effects of this is to
encrypt one's swap volume. CryptoAPI still cannot do this safely,
but it is in development. A similar project, LoopAES, already can encrypt
a system's swap space.
</p><p>
Consider again the example where I sent my iBook to Apple for repairs.
Though my home directory is encrypted, my data still may not be
completely safe. A dishonest employee could boot his or her diabolical CD-ROM
and replace, for example, the login binary on my system with the employee's
own design. When my computer is returned and I log in, my encryption
key could be shipped off to a remote computer by the newly
installed login program. An intrusion detection system would make this
scenario much less likely.
</p><p>
Another possible weak point in a system employing encrypted home
directories using pam_mount is the system's login password.
Because the login password is used, directly or indirectly, to unlock
an encrypted filesystem, it must be strong. Countless studies have shown
that most passwords chosen by users are quite weak. Rather than blindly
increasing the required length of passwords, spend some time reading Bruce
Schneier's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Secrets and Lies</em></span>. A strong passphrase, written down and
stored in your wallet may be more secure than a memorized password.
The addition of a physical authentication token might be even better.
Remember, if your system login password is not secure, your encrypted
filesystem is as good as read.
</p><p>
Finally, encrypted filesystems can be a double-edged sword. What if you
forget your encryption key? What if you use the third technique described
above and accidentally delete all records of your encrypted filesystem
key? What if my or someone else's encryption-related software is
buggy? All of these problems can result in you having to try
2<sup  >128</sup>
or so different encryption keys to get your filesystem back. Your data
may be as good as gone. As with any system administration endeavor,
make filesystem backups. Ideally, these backups are <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> encrypted
and are physically locked up somewhere secure.
</p><p>
The bottom line is many subtle considerations and procedures are required
to administer a reasonably secure system beyond the use of a modern
encryption algorithm like AES. To quote Matt Blaze's contribution
to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Applied Cryptography</em></span>:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
High-quality ciphers and protocols are important tools, but
by themselves poor substitutes for realistic, critical thinking about
what is being protected and how various defenses might fail (attackers,
after all, rarely restrict themselves to the clean, well-defined threat
models of the academic world).
</p></blockquote></div><p>
After reading this article, you should be familiar with the concept
of an encrypted loopback filesystem. In addition, you should be able to
deploy encrypted filesystems on the systems you administer and manage
them with the pam_mount PAM module. In the future, I would like to see the
CryptoAPI patches and pam_mount supported by the major Linux distributors.
I also would like to see the CryptoAPI patch rolled into the mainstream
util-linux package. Properly administered encrypted home directories
are a powerful security tool.
