Welcome to our annual issue about necessary
information technology security tools for the
enterprise, I mean sinister tools of massive
repression.
</p><p>
What's the difference? In most cases, only the
use to which you put the tool. Security is
a fascinating subject because it exercises both
your logical, problem-solving side&mdash;what would an
attacker have to compromise to get from point A
to point B&mdash;and your conscience.
</p><p>
You've often heard that security has to be
designed in, not bolted on. That makes everyone
in information technology a security professional,
whether it says &ldquo;security&rdquo; on your business card
or not. And as a security professional, you have
to consider security threats at two levels: the
many small attacks from people who want to copy
credit-card numbers, send spam and deface
web sites, and the larger, slower attack from
those who want to destroy our civilized way of
life on the Net, with all its messy free speech,
and institute a tidy regime of surveillance and
&ldquo;digital rights management&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Professor Lawrence Lessig, in <span   class="emphasis"><em>Code and
Other Laws of Cyberspace</em></span>, makes the most
powerful case for considering your beliefs and
your politics when you go to work on technology.
Code is law. How you build a system affects how
some users of the system can regulate others.
So the security you put into place to protect you
from small attacks should not facilitate the one
large attack on freedom itself.
</p><p>
It's important to let your conscience guide your
technical decisions, but it's just as important to
back up your political positions with the facts
about the technologies to which they apply.
Proposals for &ldquo;trusted computing&rdquo; are the subject
of justifiable concern among freedom lovers.
Nobody wants to give up the PC for a sealed box with a
so-called Fritz chip, named after authoritarian
US Senator Ernest &ldquo;Fritz&rdquo; Hollings, that would
prevent you from running a free operating system
or recording your own music.
</p><p>
But Fritz chip hysteria is sometimes misdirected
at new technologies or proposed specifications
that wouldn't take away your freedom to run the
software of your choice and might even have
some beneficial applications. Is the Trusted
Computing Platform Alliance unfairly maligned?
Read the article on TCPA by David Safford, Jeff
Kravitz and Leendert van Doorn on page 50, then
get their free TCPA code and decide for yourself.
</p><p>
You can give a big boost to your personal
information security by encrypting your home
directory. Making it work seamlessly is tricky,
though, and Mike Petullo addresses the hard parts
head-on on page 62.
</p><p>
The US National Security Agency's SE Linux is one
of the hottest topics in security today, and Faye
Coker gives us an introduction in Kernel Korner
on page 20. Russell Coker follows up on page
56 with a report on what happens if you give out
the root password&mdash;can the SE Linux rules alone
protect the system?
</p><p>
Daniel R. Allen has written a helpful article
on one of the most common Linux security tools,
OpenSSH, and Mick Bauer continues his series on
OpenLDAP, a multifunctional directory service.
There's plenty of thought-provoking information
this issue, so stay informed and, in the immortal
words of the Google employee handbook, &ldquo;Don't
be evil.&rdquo;
