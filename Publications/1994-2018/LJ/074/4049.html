call &ldquo;Misshelved Books&mdash;the Librarian's Nightmare&rdquo;. Thus,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Book of J</em></span> is found among Iverson's
Programming Languages and <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Bourne
Conspiracy</em></span> in the UNIX Shell section. Search the tiny
Linux Driver shelf, and you'll probably find P. D. James's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Devices and Desires</em></span>.
</p><p>And where else but in the bulging OO (Object Orienteering)
category would you expect Alan Bennett's <span   class="emphasis"><em>A Private
Function</em></span>, Marlo Morgan's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mutant Message Down
Under</em></span> (surely a Dinkumware production) and Baudrillard's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>le syste&ccedil;me des objets</em></span>?</p><p>The latter, one of those impenetrable culture-theoretic works
the French are so good at, probably merits its place alongside the
growing number of mystical and pseudo-philosophical books on OO as
the one true path to code nirvana. But to avoid memory leaks,
remember that each constructor must be followed by a
deconstructor.</p><p>A more general, cynical observation notes the large number of
computer manuals filed under Non-Fiction.</p><p>Springer-Verlag's math lists have some strange titles just
begging for misclassification: <span   class="emphasis"><em>Equimultiplicity and
Blowing Up</em></span>, by Herrmann, Ikeda and Orbanz, surely
belongs in the Balkan History section&mdash;and what about
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Motions of Coupled Bodies about a Fixed Point</em></span>?
Don't ask. Yet, there was that great, deliberately teasing book,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Joy of X</em></span>.</p><p>Now dated is the joke that the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Norton
Classics</em></span> series escaped misfiling under DOS 8080
Assembly Coding because the great man's mugshot did not grace the
covers. Also fading from our collective memories are tales of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Five Graves to Cairo</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Chicago
Style Guide</em></span> being catalogued under Microsoft
Vaporware.</p><p>I've also noted some non-technical LibCat glitches:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Trials of Oscar Wilde</em></span> under Humor,
Anai&lt;\#239&gt;s Nin's diaries under Fiction (well, one never
knows) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Black Beauty</em></span> under African-American
Studies.</p><p>The quirks of ASCII sorting by title show up in weird
librarian contiguities. Thus, immediately after <span   class="emphasis"><em>Software
Engineering with Ada</em></span>, one booklist offers Rich Zubaty's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Surviving the Feminization of America: How to Keep Women
from Ruining Your Life</em></span>. If Lady Lovelace were alive
today, she'd be turning in her grave!</p><p>We have happily left behind us those tab-card restrictions
whereby titles were crudely curtailed to fit 80 (and even 22)
columns. I still treasure invoices for &ldquo;WHYIAM&rdquo; (Russell's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Why I Am Not a Christian</em></span>) and (shades of
Edward Lear) &ldquo;MOZDONG&rdquo; (Mozart's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Don
Giovanni</em></span>). As Fritz Spiegl, my favorite musicologist,
remarked, &ldquo;From the sublime to the cor-blimey.&rdquo;</p><p>On the bright side (there's always a bright side, except
perhaps for Java Standards), misplaced books add to the joy of
browsing. Recall <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Three Princes of
Serendip</em></span>, the heroes of which had the fairy-tale gift of
accidental discovery? Horace Walpole post-coined the word
&ldquo;serendipity&rdquo; in 1754, and with its own touch of magical
self-reference, the word survives. You can find it in action each
time you visit your public library's Recent Additions section, a
random set of books <span   class="emphasis"><em>awaiting</em></span>
misallocation.</p><p>Which is where I first spotted Eric S. Raymond's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral &amp; The Bazaar</em></span> (O'Reilly,
Sebastopol, CA) in the hard-covered flesh, as it were. On my next
visit, the book had moved to&mdash;who knows where? Medieval Economics?
Church History? The clever numerical system (which I've dubbed
Dewey-It-Yourself) presupposes a categorical knowledge of content
in areas where the categories are forever shifting. Eric's book,
following expansive explanatory titular trends, does have the
helpful subtitle <span   class="emphasis"><em>Musings on Linux and Open Source by an
Accidental Revolutionary</em></span>, so I hope it found its way to
the &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; shelf. Or rather, with duplicate copies, to
several shelves, since <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Cathedral &amp; The
Bazaar</em></span> is aimed at a wide audience, including those who
do not usually visit the Computer section.</p><p>In the meantime, I've acquired my own copy (via amazon.com
[shameless plug]) and plan an in-depth review in next month's
column. Rather late, I fear, since everyone from Linus Torvalds and
Tom Peters to Guy Kawasaki, from Brian Behlendorf and Wayne Caccamo
to Larry Augustin (and more) has stamped their approval. Yet, I
will try to be objective&mdash;not easy, since Eric and I have
collaborated on and off over the years on hackers' lexicography,
and he has graciously reviewed one of <span   class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span>
books.</p></div></div>
