Was the Command Line
</p><p>Jokes beginning &ldquo;If operating systems ran airlines&rdquo; first
appeared on the Web around 1995. Linux wasn't mentioned back then,
but it is now, like in this set published in the September 1999
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Gazette</em></span> and condensed here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>UNIX Airways: everyone brings one piece of the
plane along when they come to the airport. They all go out on the
runway and put the plane together piece by piece, arguing non-stop
about what kind of plane they are supposed to be building.</p></li><li><p>Mac Airlines: all the airline personnel look and
act exactly the same. Every time you ask questions about details,
you are gently but firmly told that you don't need to know, don't
want to know, and everything will be done for you without your ever
having to know, so just shut up.</p></li><li><p>Windows Air: the terminal is pretty and colorful,
with friendly stewards, easy baggage check and boarding and a
smooth take-off. After about 10 minutes in the air, the plane
explodes with no warning whatsoever.</p></li><li><p>Windows NT Air: just like Windows Air, but costs
more, uses much bigger planes, and takes out all other aircraft
within a 40-mile radius when it explodes. (The 1995
version&mdash;everyone marches out on the runway, says the password in
unison, and forms the outline of an airplane. Then they all sit
down and make a whooshing sound like they're flying.)</p></li><li><p>Linux Air: disgruntled employees of all the other
OS airlines decide to start their own airline. They build the
planes, ticket counters and pave the runways themselves. They
charge a small fee to cover the cost of printing the ticket, but
you can also download and print the ticket yourself. When you board
the plane, you are given a seat, four bolts, a wrench and a copy of
the Seat-HOWTO.html. Once settled, the fully adjustable seat is
very comfortable, the plane leaves and arrives on time without a
problem and the in-flight meal is wonderful. You try to tell
customers of the other airlines about the great trip, but all they
can say is, &ldquo;You had to do <span   class="emphasis"><em>what</em></span> with the
seat?&rdquo;</p></li></ul></div><p>I'd change that last one to open with &ldquo;UNIX geeks who
finally figured out what kind of plane they were supposed to be
building ...&rdquo; And I'd end it with, &ldquo;After a while, nearly
everyone flew Linux Air, whether they knew it or not.&rdquo;
</p><p>To the extent that flying with computers happens mostly over
the Net, the Linux takeover is already underway. The recent surge
in Apache's dominance owes to the growing adoption not just of
Linux, but of the BSDs and other UNIX breeds that share Linux'
virtues.</p><p>But there's still that problem with the seats. I witnessed it
at PC Forum in March, where attendees were given Net access (and
everything else they could figure out) through dozens of VA Linux
systems running GNOME. This was candy for the technical types, but
it was like chewing on rubber bands for everybody else. Under
normal conditions, I'm about the last guy you'd want to call for
tech support, but I found myself walking around explaining things
to venture capitalists, dot-com zillionaires and other smart guys
who looked as lost as moths in lampshades, flummoxed by a user
interface that produced cryptic pop-out menus and windows that
iconized to locations other than the bottom of the screen.</p><p>&ldquo;How can I open a Word file?&rdquo; one guy asked. Another looked
for &ldquo;Excel or something like it&rdquo;. We found ways to help some of
these folks, but the lack of obvious &ldquo;office&rdquo; applications did
not sell Linux as a desktop OS. I asked more than a dozen of these
guys if they were tempted in any way by their experience with Linux
at the show. Without exception, the answer was no (but a few
open-minded tech types had kind words for GNOME).</p><p>The break-out session didn't help, either. Despite valiant
efforts by the VA guys, it was too easy for the majority to dismiss
the evidence: some Mozilla innovations (still a no-show), a nice
little open-source presentation program (with jaggy screen fonts)
and new banner-blocking software (old hat on Windows). Afterwards,
a veteran <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC Magazine</em></span> editor told me they
really like Linux and want to give it positive coverage, but in the
absence of productivity applications, there's almost nothing other
than the usual sports coverage of server-vs.-server games.</p><p>Nobody is more aware of the situation than Larry Augustin,
the founder, President and CEO of VA Linux. In February, Larry and
I were both on an open-source panel put on by the New York New
Media Association. There, he made the surprising point that so far,
open-source developers haven't understood the significance of
Microsoft Office, which&mdash;far more than Windows&mdash;is at the core of
Microsoft's appeal. After we got back, I asked him to run that one
by me again to make sure I got it right. He replied:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Open-source developers understand UNIX. This is
part of what made it possible to create a better UNIX&mdash;Linux. In
order to create a better MS Office, open-source developers need to
understand MS Office in as much detail as they understood UNIX. My
fear is that the open-source developer community doesn't understand
Office. It can't create what it doesn't understand. What we need
are more developers using Windows and Office.</p></blockquote></div><p>Tall order. Most open-source developers I know would rather
not stain their retinas with light from Microsoft pixels. So we
live with office suites (including fractions of suites) from Sun
(StarOffice), Applix and Corel. All three are closed source. In the
absence of source code, there's little for developers to work with,
so the problem persists.
</p><p>Maybe we should come at it from a different angle. Airlines
are kind of a server-like metaphor. Let's try a metaphor that works
better for clients: cars. That's what Neal Stephenson does in his
outstanding new book, <span   class="emphasis"><em>In the Beginning was the Command
Line</em></span>. Best known for his bestsellers <span   class="emphasis"><em>Snow
Crash</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Cryptonomicon</em></span>, Stephenson
is (like me) a convert to Linux from the MacOS. To frame his
context, he offers an automobile metaphor:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Microsoft&mdash;Started out selling three-speed bikes
(MS-DOS). These were not perfect, but they worked, and when they
broke, you could easily fix them. Eventually, they came out with a
colossal station wagon (Windows 95). It had all the aesthetic
appeal of a Soviet worker housing block, it leaked oil and blew
gaskets, and it was an enormous success. NT was an off-road
version: no more beautiful than the station wagon, and only a
little more reliable. Apple&mdash;another bike dealership that one day
began selling motorized vehicles, expensive but attractively styled
cars with their innards hermetically sealed, so that how they
worked was something of a mystery.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Be&mdash;a dealership selling fully operational
&ldquo;batmobiles&rdquo;. These were more beautiful and stylish than the
Euro-sedans, better designed, more technically advanced, and at
least as reliable as anything else on the market&mdash;and yet cheaper
than the others.</p></blockquote></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Linux&mdash;not a business at all. It's a bunch of
RVs, yurts, tepees and geodesic domes set up in a field and
organized by consensus. The people who live there are making tanks.
No ordinary tanks, these. They've been modified in such a way that
they never, ever break down, are light and maneuverable enough to
use on ordinary streets... Best of all, these tanks are being
cranked out, on the spot, at a terrific pace, and a vast number of
them are lined up along the edge of the road with the keys in the
ignition. Anyone who wants to can simply climb into one and drive
it away for free. These are sold by volunteer hackers with
bullhorns: &ldquo;Save your money! Accept one of our free tanks!... We
will send volunteers to your house to fix it for free while you
sleep!&rdquo; The buyers reply, &ldquo;Stay away from my house, you freak!&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Can't you see that everyone is buying station
wagons?&rdquo;</p></blockquote></div><p>The question is, for how long? I see an answer in the
original Volkswagen Beetle. Ugly, uncomfortable, noisy and lacking
conveniences like AC and automatic anything, VW bugs became a
sensation in the early sixties for three simple reasons: they were
cheap, reliable and easy to fix. In fact, they were so easy to fix
that I remember a day when a buddy and I took out an engine and put
it back three times. I'm not even sure we were sober.
</p><p>On the server side, we have something of a VW Bug in the
Cobalt Qube, a cute little appliance that's handy for the SOHO
(home office) market. On the client side, we'll soon see appliances
from Intel and others. But there's a big problem with the appliance
concept: they're closed as bricks, almost by definition. That
disqualifies them as VW Bugs.</p><p>The real equivalent of a VW Bug is a cheap and charmingly
ugly client box that can run a stripped-down open-source office
suite and bring up a bash shell. While that may sound scary to
GUI-&lt;\#252&gt;ber-alles bigots (like Neal Stephenson and I used
to be), consider this item: even though Apple will still have heaps
of closed stuff running on top of their OS-X kernel (Mach inside a
custom version of BSD&mdash;all open source), the OS will be accessible
where it counts, through shells and a command-line interface. This
is a far more interesting and useful innovation than the pixel job
Apple is giving its old interface. Why? Because its market includes
mechanics as well as drivers. No mechanics&mdash;no market.</p><p>Today, Microsoft is to operating systems what Detroit was to
automobiles in 1963. They're way too comfortable making unreliable
chrome-encrusted land yachts that people buy out of habit and fear.
All it's going to take to break those habits is a box that both
drivers and mechanics would love. Remember, never underestimate the
fear-reducing powers of a first-rate mechanic&mdash;especially when it's
yourself.</p></div></div>
