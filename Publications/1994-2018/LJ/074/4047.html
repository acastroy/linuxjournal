    The godfather of Linus' children and the glue that holds the
    Linux community together tells us a bit about his life and
    involvement in the programming community.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb21580.0xc194a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Often I get questions of how I got
started in Linux, why I like Linux, or why I spend so much time on
Linux. In this article, I hope to show that the concepts of free
software and the gift of intellectual property to complete
strangers are not necessarily new ideas.
</p><p>The year was 1968. I was a college student studying
electrical engineering at Drexel Institute of Technology (now
Drexel University) in Philadelphia, PA. As a cooperative education
student, I was expected to go into industry for a six-month work
period. With great luck, I managed to land a job at the Western
Electric Plant in Baltimore, Maryland.</p><p>The plant, which employed thousands of people, principally
made wire for the Bell System. As part of the engineering
department, they had an IBM 1130 computer that was run by a small
staff of programmers/operators. The 1130 was a single-task machine,
where you would typically write a program in FORTRAN, punch it on
cards, and compile, link and run your program all at one time.
Since the 1130 also had console lights and a very noisy disk coil,
you could &ldquo;see&rdquo; and &ldquo;hear&rdquo; your program run. With a little
practice, you could even tell when your program was in trouble by
watching the console lights and listening to the disk drive
&ldquo;grunt&rdquo;.</p><p>Back in those days, people did not have computers in their
homes, and even the most forward-thinking high schools usually did
not have a computer, so there was no way I could have learned to
program an IBM 1130 in school. So I jumped at the chance to
participate in a correspondence course called &ldquo;Programming the IBM
1130 in FORTRAN&rdquo;, sponsored by Western Electric. Over that summer,
I learned to program the machine, completing a few small tasks for
my supervisor, John Kammer. The people who ran the computer in the
lab were very helpful to me, answering my many questions very
patiently, which made a lasting impression.</p><p>Drexel had two large machines: one was a Burroughs B5500, the
other an IBM. The IBM was shared as a facility with the University
of Pennsylvania and Temple University. Both the IBM and the
Burroughs were programmed with punched cards, and neither were
available for me to &ldquo;watch the lights and hear the grunts&rdquo;. In
other words, they were &ldquo;glass house&rdquo; machines. Discouraged by
this, I looked around the school and found an electrical
engineering lab with a couple of PDP-8 &ldquo;minicomputers&rdquo;, a Linc-8
minicomputer (all made by Digital Equipment Corporation) and a Data
General Nova. These were &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo; machines, using an ASR-33
Teletype (five characters per second output) as printer/console
terminals and paper tape as the load medium. Loading the editor
took five minutes; loading the assembler took 15 minutes. A
complete round of &ldquo;edit, assemble, load program and run&rdquo; took
about half an hour, even with no editing time taken into account. A
person got used to checking their code very carefully, in order to
find as many errors on each run as possible.</p><p>Drexel offered no courses in computer languages. If you
wanted to learn FORTRAN, you learned it on your own. If you wanted
to learn assembly, you learned that on your own. Fortunately, I
somehow made the acquaintance of the Digital Equipment Corporation
salesman who gave me a couple of paperback books, one of which was
on the fundamentals of programming in assembler, the other entitled
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Programming the PDP-8</em></span>. From these two books, I
started the task of learning to program the machines in assembly
language. While learning assembler language programming from a book
might sound daunting to some, the books (part of a handbook series
put out by Digital) were very good, and along with the other
students using the lab (the &ldquo;lab rats&rdquo;), we managed to coach each
other through the process.</p><p>Later, several of the &ldquo;lab rats&rdquo; started a computer club.
Our goal was to try to teach others how to use the minicomputers.
We had some help from two sources: the DEC salesman (who gave us
more books and encouragement) and the organization known as DECUS.
Even in those early days, DEC's User Society had student chapters,
and they also had a catalog of freely distributable software&mdash;free
for the copying cost of transfer to paper tape, or (for the
&ldquo;really wealthy&rdquo;) magnetic tape. There were hundreds of titles,
from text editors to programs for doing mathematical analysis of
all types. Each of these programs had been written by a DECUS
member and submitted to the DECUS library for free
dissemination.</p><p>I never forgot the kindness of that Digital salesman, nor the
philosophy of the DECUS organization. It would have a profound
effect on my later life, both as I chose new jobs and as I dealt
with other people.</p><p>After graduation, I started looking for a job. I had several
offers from different companies including the Bell System, but they
all wanted people to program in high-level languages, and I wanted
to continue to program in assembly. My chance came with Aetna Life
and Casualty, an insurance company in Hartford, CT.</p><p>At the time, Aetna was the &ldquo;largest multi-line insurance
company in the free world&rdquo;, which goes to show that if you use
enough qualifiers, you can be the best of anything. Nevertheless,
Aetna employed over 4,000 programmers, operators and computer
operations people at their headquarters in Hartford, and they
developed some of the first real-time transaction systems in the
industry. They had a massive floor of IBM equipment, and they were
the &ldquo;largest commercial customer of IBM in the free world&rdquo;. I was
hired to write programs in IBM assembly. I told the interviewers I
had never coded in IBM assembler, but they said they felt I &ldquo;could
learn&rdquo;. So before I left for Hartford, I went to a bookstore and
purchased a book on IBM assembly language and read it. Between that
book and the IBM <span   class="emphasis"><em>Principles of Operations of the IBM
360</em></span> manual, I learned the language and
architecture.</p><p>While working at Aetna, two major things occurred. First, I
started going to graduate school at night for my MSCS; the second
was making friends with some of the operators of the machines. The
second event brought me out of a shell I was in, and made me more
outgoing. It also gave me physical access to the computer floor,
something very useful from time to time as a programmer at Aetna. I
also noticed that my tapes got mounted faster, my listings were
sorted nicer, and various good things happened to me because I
liked these people and treated them with respect. Other programmers
who did not treat them with respect often had a hard time getting
good service. Another major lesson learned in life.</p><p>After receiving my MSCS and having worked in two major
divisions of Aetna over a four-year period, I decided to try my
hand at teaching. I answered an advertisement for an assistant
professor at Hartford State Technical College, a small two-year
technical college in Hartford. Before taking the job or even
applying for it, I spent a morning at the school looking at the
lab, browsing through the college catalog and talking to the
students.</p><p>I liked the lab at Hartford, because (unlike many schools of
the day) it was not keypunch-card-oriented. Instead, they had
twelve terminals hooked up to a PDP-11/70 timesharing machine,
along with a stand-alone PDP-11/34 with a graphics tube and a large
Gerber plotter for making drawings. The curriculum taught courses
such as operating system design and compiler theory, both of which
I felt were necessary if a programmer was truly to know what they
were doing. Finally, the students were friendly and seemed to be
dedicated to learning computer science. Remember, this was 1977,
and for most of these students, HSTC was the first time they had
set hand to computer keyboard.</p><p>I gave Aetna a two-week notice and took a $3,000 pay cut to
teach at HSTC (to put things in perspective, in 1975 I bought a
brand-new Toyota pickup truck for $5,000). But for the next four
years, I enjoyed teaching at the school.</p><p>Most of you have heard that my nickname &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; came from
the school and from my &ldquo;discussions&rdquo; with the Dean of
Instruction. Even with these &ldquo;discussions&rdquo; (and sometimes even
because of them), I look back on HSTC with fondness. Taking
students who have no knowledge of computers at all and training
them to be good programmers and designers, so they could enter the
work force and get good jobs, has to be one of the most rewarding
feelings in the world, no matter what the pay scale. Unfortunately,
I have a rather eclectic lifestyle, and after four years, it
started to catch up with me. Sadly, I left HSTC (after giving a
year's notice) and went on to the next phase of my career, Bell
Laboratories, to the dismay of the students, but to the cheering
crowds of my creditors.</p><p>When I started interviewing at Bell Labs, the management
wanted me to be the system administrator for a CDC Cyber machine.
The CDC was a fascinating machine, and this would have been a good
job, but I had heard Bell had their own operating system called
Eunuchs, and I wanted to learn that. Eventually, the Lab management
agreed, and I was hired as a system administrator for an operating
system I had never seen.</p><p>The first few months of being a UNIX system administrator
were &ldquo;difficult&rdquo;. Learning this new operating system that had no
real good documentation, seemed to have programs scattered
throughout the file system, and even had a deep hierarchical file
system (instead of a flat &ldquo;catalog&rdquo; file system) was hard for me.
Fortunately, I met two senior engineers there who (although they
had not been trained in computer science) were administering two
Digital machines, a PDP-11/70 and a VAX 11/780. They gave me
guidance until I was ready to take over responsibility. However,
after a short time I &ldquo;got the swing of it&rdquo;, and I also started
teaching at night at Merrimack College in North Andover, MA. I did
both of these jobs for four more years.</p><p>While at Bell Labs, I met a Digital salesman who told me
about a project at Digital to create a commercial version of UNIX
for the PDP-11 and VAX line. Since I was having some philosophical
differences with the management at Bell Labs, I decided to leave
them and go to Digital. There, I met a group of young, enthusiastic
engineers who were determined to make the world's best UNIX system.
It was too bad that their management did not share that vision. For
the next sixteen years, we struggled to create and sell a UNIX
product inside a corporation that (for the most part) only wanted
to say &ldquo;VMS&rdquo; (later &ldquo;OpenVMS&rdquo;) and &ldquo;Windows NT&rdquo;. We struggled
(and finally won) the battle of getting GNU software onto our
distribution, after almost every other vendor was bundling it. It
was at the start of these fifteen years that I was (once again)
thrust back into DECUS and started attending USENIX
conferences.</p><p>USENIX in 1983 was an exciting time. People came to this
technical conference to talk about how they were improving the UNIX
operating system. While many talks came from academia, some were
from companies like Mitre, BBN and others that needed to have UNIX
move forward for their own business reasons. After a talk was
given, the UUCP address of where to get the code would be listed,
or else a complete source code listing was included in the
proceedings. However, as more and more companies got into the
market of selling UNIX distributions in binary form, and more and
more companies started buying UNIX this way, the availability of
source code almost completely dried up. Although USENIX kept
providing the venue for concept and knowledge exchange, it took
many years and the insertion of the Open Source community before
the same feeling of excitement came back.</p><p>While at Digital, I was a software engineer, a product
manager and finally, a technical marketing manager. As a technical
marketing manager, I had three main jobs. The first was to take
complex technical concepts and present them in simple terms to
customers; the second to take customer's requirements and feed them
to engineering; and finally, to help create marketing opportunities
for Digital. This included working with DECUS to make technical
presentations relevant to the customer's needs.</p><p>As part of DECUS, there was a special interest group (SIG)
called UNISIG which looked into &ldquo;everything UNIX&rdquo;. Kurt Reisler,
the group's chairperson, had heard of a small operating system that
had been started in Finland and was now being developed all over
the world. He wanted to invite the architect of this operating
system to DECUS in New Orleans in May of 1994. After watching Kurt
send many, many letters to potential funders of the ticket, I
decided this would be worthwhile for our customers and convinced my
management to fund the ticket and hotel costs. It was in New
Orleans that I first saw Linux and met Linus Torvalds.</p><p>After DECUS was over, I took Linus out on the Natchez, one of
the riverboats that goes up and down the Mississippi River. We had
dinner and discussed Linux. I asked Linus if he had ever considered
porting Linux to a 64-bit processor and a RISC chip, to make sure
it was portable. Linus told me he had considered that, but was
having trouble getting an Alpha system from the Digital people in
Helsinki. Knowing Digital's procedures, I could imagine the
Helsinki people were trying, but having difficulty. I went back to
my office, called a few friends, pulled in a few favors, and an
Alpha system was on its way to Linus' apartment.</p><p>As I was getting the system for Linus, I became aware of how
many engineers inside Digital were already using Linux, and that a
group in Digital Semiconductor was trying to port Linux to the
Alpha, but as a 32-bit port, not a 64-bit port as Linus was doing.
With a little convincing, I got them to join forces with
Linus.</p><p>In January of 1995, the project actually got underway, and as
it unfolded, I found many people in the Linux community who wanted
to help. Some people who already had access to an Alpha immediately
started working on the code. Others actually bought their own Alpha
to help with the project. In November of 1995, the first
distribution of Alpha Linux came out. I was proud of the fact that
the Linux community thought so much of Alpha, Digital and their own
Linux system that they had all cooperated on this project.</p><p>About the same time, my travel schedule picked up and I
started going all over the world to speak on Digital UNIX (the
commercial system available from Digital). As I went from customer
to customer, I would ask the same question: &ldquo;Do you use Linux
here?&rdquo; Almost every one had the same pattern&mdash;the management said
&ldquo;No&rdquo;, and the technical people would say &ldquo;Yes, but don't tell
our managers.&rdquo; As I continued on my trips, more and more of my
presentations became oriented toward Linux, and I began to write
articles for both internal use and <i  >Linux Journal</i>.</p><p>In 1996, the original Executive Director for Linux
International stepped down, and I was elected to this position. For
three years, I volunteered as Executive of Linux International
while doing my duties at Digital Equipment. At first, it was
relatively easy to work for both, but as the Linux marketplace
heated up, I put in more hours on both sides. Finally, I had an
offer from Larry Augustin of VA Linux Systems to have VA Linux pay
my salary but work for Linux International full-time, so I left
Digital and have been working on Linux International full-time
since the spring of 1999.</p><p>I have been in the industry more than thirty years. All along
the way, there have been people helping me out, giving me guidance
and advice. While some of it was bad advice, much of it was good,
and most of it was given with the best possible intentions. I have
participated in the industry in both profit-making and
non-profit-making projects. I have tried (not always completely
successfully) to keep my word at all times, and to &ldquo;do right&rdquo; by
the &ldquo;customer&rdquo;, whoever I considered &ldquo;the customer&rdquo; to
be.</p><p>I have found in the Linux community what I feel is the best
of all of my experiences. Good technical people to work with, open
exchange of ideas, excitement and enthusiasm for what is going on.
Young people (no matter what physical age) who strive to do their
best, but also know how to have fun. The warmth of meeting new
friends, and in some cases even being welcomed into their family.
The potential of Linux in education, embedded systems,
supercomputing, as well as the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; desktop and server
situations is both to save money and extend computer
science.</p><p>I know that in some parts of the Linux community, there is
the feeling that the &ldquo;suits are taking over&rdquo;. From my
experiences, labeling everyone in business a &ldquo;suit&rdquo; is as much an
act of bigotry (and with all the same bad features) as any other
type of bigotry. Many people I have met in industry who are moving
into the Linux marketplace <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> want to learn
what the Linux community is about, and they <span   class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span>
appreciate the culture as they try to understand it. I have faith
that the Linux community can expand to embrace these commercial
interests without diluting our message, but we have to learn that
it is easier to extend the hand of friendship rather than the
battle axe (unless the battle axe is really needed).</p><p>The picture on this month's cover is very telling. And while
some of my jobs over the years have required me to wear a suit on
occasion, I am much happier as a shorts-and-T-shirt guy. While I
have held jobs in commerce most of my life, I was and am happier
when the free exchange of ideas (including source code) is
available. And while I am definitely an American, I have been
fortunate enough to meet and enjoy many different cultures and
peoples. I hope Linux will be one of their main paths to computer
autonomy, and for some emerging nations, development of their own
computer industries.</p><p>Finally, over a thirty-year period I have been fortunate
enough to meet and know some really fantastic pioneers of the
computer industry, some famous and some not so famous. In the Linux
community, I have already met hundreds more. As the next millennium
moves on, I look forward to meeting thousands more both over the
Internet and face to face.</p></div></div>
