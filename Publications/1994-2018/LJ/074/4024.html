    The Embedded Linux Consortium and more.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f5580.0x14ed1e8"></a>The Birth of the Embedded Linux Consortium:
March 1, 2000</h2></div></div><p>Last fall, several companies in the newly emerging embedded
Linux market approached me to request that I help create a
vendor-neutral Embedded Linux trade association. Initially, I used
the resources of my newly established Embedded Linux Portal web
site
(<a href="http://www.LinuxDevices.com" target="_self">http://www.LinuxDevices.com/</a>)
to propose the establishment of a group called the &ldquo;Embedded Linux
Consortium&rdquo; (ELC). The idea for the ELC rapidly picked up
momentum.</p><p>Next, I scheduled an ELC organizational meeting to be held at
the Chicago Embedded Systems Conference in March. The purpose would
be to create a formation committee to fund the ELC and share
responsibility for it until it was incorporated and a proper Board
of Directors was elected.</p><p>March 1 came, and the ELC organizational meeting drew an
overflow crowd&mdash;nearly double the expected turnout. We could
instantly see that the ELC is destined to be a major force in the
embedded market. During the first hour of the meeting, more than
$100,000 was pledged to initially fund the organization. Also,
Lineo donated the domain name, embedded-linux.org.</p><p>A week later, the birth of the ELC was broadcast via a press
release that received extensive worldwide coverage (read it at
<a href="http://www.embedded-linux.org" target="_self">http://www.embedded-linux.org/</a>).
The announcement lists the Formation Committee members, summarizes
the organization's goals and includes this supporting statement
from Linus: &ldquo;This new Embedded Linux Consortium is an expression
of the current explosion of interest in using Linux in thousands of
specialized embedded, mobile and appliance applications. The ELC
provides a valuable resource in advancing the growing use of Linux
in embedded applications, an area where Linux can provide enormous
benefit.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f5580.0x14ed4a8"></a>Vision and Mission</h2></div></div><p>Although official Vision and Mission statements will be
established by the soon-to-be-elected Board of Directors, I
indicated my thoughts on the subject in an &ldquo;ELC Manifesto&rdquo; posted
at LinuxDevices.com and distributed at the ELC organizational
meeting:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Suggested vision: the Embedded Linux Consortium
(ELC) will be a nonprofit, vendor-neutral trade association whose
goal is the advancement and promotion of Embedded Linux throughout
the embedded, appliance and applied computing markets. Members will
contribute membership dues and efforts in return for a growing
market opportunity for all.</p></li><li><p>Suggested mission: to make Linux the number-one
operating system of choice for developers designing embedded
systems.</p></li></ul></div><p>In short, by creating and supporting the Embedded Linux
Consortium, we will maximize the depth and breadth of penetration
of Linux within the enormous&mdash;and enormously diverse&mdash;embedded
market.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f5580.0x14ed7c0"></a>Membership Categories</h2></div></div><p>We currently plan to have three membership categories:
Corporate Executive Member ($5,000 per year), Corporate Affiliate
Member ($1,000 per year) and Individual Member ($150 per year).
Recognizing there are many individuals who contribute to the
open-source code base which is the basis of Linux itself, I've also
proposed that the $150 annual membership fee for Individual Members
be waived in the case of individuals who have contributed
significantly to the open-source code base.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f5580.0x14ed8c8"></a>Activities</h2></div></div><p>The ELC's activities are likely to be along two main threads:
technical and promotional. It's likely (although not required) that
the Individual Members will be focused mostly on technical
activities, whereas promotional and marketing activities will
probably be more of a concern of the Corporate Members and,
appropriately, funded primarily by them.</p><p>On the promotional side, I expect we'll have a marketing task
force concerned with evangelizing embedded Linux. Most likely,
there will be a web site, PR, trade shows, collateral materials and
membership growth.</p><p>The technical role of the ELC is less clear than the
evangelical role, in light of the enormous success the existing
open-source development process has had in bringing Linux (and its
related technologies) to where they are today. Nonetheless, it is
certainly possible that technical committees or special interest
groups will coalesce around issues of interest to multiple ELC
members. Whether these translate into standards activity remains to
be seen. In any case, the existing Linux and open-source
development process must be supported, not circumvented or
undermined.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f5580.0x14eda80"></a>Status and Further Information</h2></div></div><p>The ELC is now officially incorporated as a non-profit trade
association in the state of California, and has the beginnings of a
web site in operation. For the latest ELC news and info, or to

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="4024bf1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Brian Behlendorf is one of the chief software architects
behind the Apache project and is the instigator of SourceXchange.
This project provides a method for programmers to get paid while
writing open-source software. As such, we would like to see it
succeed. We talked with Brian by e-mail at the end of March to see
how things were progressing.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: SourceXchange
started as a project of O'Reilly and HP, and then was spun off as
Collab.Net. What was the reasoning behind this move?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: I incubated the ideas
behind the company while employed by O'Reilly, and worked with
people there to develop a business plan, which we then shopped to a
couple of investment firms. After selecting Benchmark, we spun the
company out into its own entity, and I moved to CTO when we found a
CEO.</p><p>It was always the plan that I would be working on some ideas
at ORA, and then we'd spin them out when there was sufficient
interest. There was much more interest much sooner than we thought
there would be. SourceXchange is one service of Collab.Net&mdash;there
will be more.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Do O'Reilly and HP
still participate?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: Yes. Tim O'Reilly is
on our board, and we have lots of communication with ORA. HP is
still involved as a sponsor in SourceXchange and is also involved
in some of our additional products. They are the first customer of
our open-source project hosting infrastructure, on which their new
web site
(<a href="http://www.e-speak.net" target="_self">http://www.e-speak.net/</a>)
and open-source project sit.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Has the change
proved of benefit to the project?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: Becoming our own
company has helped us hire the people we needed to, and focus more
deeply on this as a business, which we feel it needed to be
long-term.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Tell us exactly how
SourceXchange works.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: Well, the
http://www.sourcexchange.com/ site goes into quite a bit of detail
on this, so I won't repeat what's said there. The short answer
is:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Sponsor submits an RFP (request for
program)<b  >--&gt;</b>Developers submit proposals/bids
on that RFP<b  >--&gt;</b>Sponsor selects a
proposal.<b  >--&gt;</b>Project
begins.<b  >--&gt;</b>Developers work towards a
milestone, then upload their code.<b  >--&gt;</b>Sponsors
review it and approve or disapprove.<b  >--&gt;</b>If
they disapprove, developer keeps working until the sponsor is
happy, or until a peer reviewer says the milestone is
met.<b  >--&gt;</b>Repeat until all milestones are
approved and project is
completed.<b  >--&gt;</b>Sponsors, developers and peer
reviewers rate each other.
</p><p>Repeat. =)</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>:
How many programming projects have actually been finished? Which
ones?
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: Two&mdash;the Generic Data
Packet Recorder, sponsored by Sparks.com and completed on 2/18/00;
and a Test Suite Framework for the Apache Web Server, sponsored by
HP and completed on 11/20/99. For details, see
<a href="http://www.sourcexchange.com/ProjectBrowse?Button=Search&amp;browse_status=Completed&amp;browse_status=Archived" target="_self">www.sourcexchange.com/ProjectBrowse?Button=Search&amp;browse_status=Completed&amp;browse_status=Archived</a>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What is the biggest
project to be finished at this time?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: Both of them were
$5,000 US projects, but there are now some in the $25,000 US range
in the system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Which project have
you personally been the most interested in?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: The test suite for
Apache was fairly interesting to me. Right now, the most
interesting one is probably the Apache 2.0-related handler
(Listener Module) for a protocol called BXXP, sponsored by
Invisible Worlds (project #13). I've also got a project of my own
I'm pretty happy about, a Java servlet- and WebMacro-based browser
for UNIX mbox-format mail archives, sponsored by Collab.netproject
(project #11).</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Does SourceXchange
take up all your time, or do you still get to do some
programming?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: Collab.Net in
general, as well as doing all the political and back-end work for
Apache, consumes most of my time. I haven't done serious
programming in a long time, but still write the odd Perl script
each week.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Obviously, you are
still involved with Apache. What's going on there?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: Tons&mdash;ApacheCon was
just completed and was a resounding success, with over 1000
attendees and some great sessions. Apache 2.0 is in alpha. XML and
Jakarta are taking off.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Do you feel the
SourceXchange project is a success? (Are programmers actually
getting paid?)</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: Yes. There is over
$300,000 in the system right now for developers, and it's just the
beginning, really.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Do you see this
project as leading the way for how all programming will be done in
the future?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: No, but it will be an
important component. Sometimes you are willing to trade off quality
and correctness for determinism and speed, and thus you need
in-house developers. Sometimes the software you're developing needs
to be done in-house for proprietary reasons. I'm not one to state
that all software will be free in the future, although I think most
of it will be.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What do you see in
the future for open-source software and Linux?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: Great things. Further
expansion. As software becomes infrastructure, it becomes
commoditized, and open-source software is the most stable state of
infrastructure because of its ubiquity and low cost to use.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Anything you'd like
to add?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: Not really; I've done
an awful lot of proselytizing over the last few years, and now feel
a need to turn that energy toward making sXc and other Collab.Net
projects a success, so I've been more quiet recently.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: To wrap up, how
about some personal-type information?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Brian</b></span>: I've been married for
almost five years, have a house in San Francisco, am really into
DJ'ing ambient and dub music, use a Sony Vaio C1-XS as my laptop,
drive a Jeep, and enjoy microbrew root beer.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Thanks very much for
taking the time to answer our questions. --Marjorie

TRICKS<b  >--&gt;</b>Raster Bars and Console
Graphics</h2></div></div><p>Hello, and welcome yet again to another episode of Stupid
Programming Tricks! Last month, which I hope you didn't miss, we
got a wee bit complicated, making a sine scroller by plugging sine
functions into each other. The process involved lots of variables
and functions, and really taxed the processor. This month, it's
time to relax a bit from complicated things, but nevertheless we'll
do something cool, and it <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> involve
sines.</p><p>Former demo-sceners may have noticed a trend in this column:
that much of what we do is passed down from a certain tradition.
Where is the 3-D &lt;\#224&gt; la Quake? Where are the filled
vector graphics? Where are the trippy acid effects? Alas, your
amiable author missed the PC scene for a short-lived adventure in,
well, something else, before discovering Linux, so we still believe
a demo should have a scrolltext and that 2-D is
<span   class="emphasis"><em>okay</em></span>. Now, we've done more with scrolltexts
than most people can stand; however, there is a tradition just as
ubiquitous as the scrolltext, and probably even easier: the raster
bar.</p><p>A raster graphic is basically a bitmapped graphic (as opposed
to a vector graphic), thus a raster bar is a bitmapped graphic of a
bar. Usually we draw these bars with cool, shaded colors, so that
they look like horizontal pipes or laser beams, and we make them
bounce up and down on the screen, which looks rather cool. What is
the point of such bars? There is none! Well, actually, sometimes
it's to show off the computer's colors; sometimes to delineate
different areas of the screen; sometimes it's just to add something
interesting and technological to look at. When the palette is
properly set up, the bars can look like shiny metallic pipes or
perhaps glorious rainbows. You can even scroll the colors inside of
raster bars for all kinds of funky effects. You could sync the
color scrolling to the vertical position of the bar, as though the
passing raster bar uncovered hidden colors in the screen. You could
cycle the colors in numerous ways inside the bar (turning blue
pipes to purple, red, orange, yellow, green and back to blue), or
you could pass colors between several raster bars on the
screen.</p><p>Another clever trick is to include a scrolltext
<span   class="emphasis"><em>inside</em></span> of a raster bar. This has numerous
advantages; for one thing, you don't have to worry about making
sure the background shows up properly in the black space underneath
the letters, since you're filling the whole thing up with raster
color. You don't need to clean up areas before writing with raster
bars, because the bars overwrite whatever's there initially. And,
the colors of the raster bar can highlight the text like a
high-energy laser beam.</p><p>One influential demo for me on the Amiga was Hot Copper by
Acro of Rigor Mortis. It used several large raster bars of
different colors scrolling up the screen and then falling down
again in order to display several different scrolltexts of varying
speeds with different text. In the days before the Net as we know
it, words were rare and meant much more; scrolltexts were like
messages in bottles found at the beach, greetings from faraway
shores, by people you actually knew! How did the text travel so
far? Who passed what disk to whom at what party, how many boards
did it go through, how long until it got to you? If only Amiga
emulation weren't so harassed by copyright zealots, we'd have a
more open time enjoying these (the Amiga ROMs are still
copyrighted, but at least the demos aren't). Alas, I
degenerate.</p><p>We're going to make six bars, each 320 pixels wide by 17
pixels high. Each bar will get to use nine colors, running from
darkest at the top to lightest in the middle and dark again at the
bottom (that's eight colors which get used twice in each bar, with
one bright color right in the middle). This makes the shiny,
pipe-looking effect for our bars. In honor of Roy G. Biv, we'll
have red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple bars, even though
logically we should use red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and purple.
Of course, cool Commodore coders made rainbow bars, but they're too
cool for us. Still, we <span   class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> fairly daring in
our own right; after all, we're using
&ldquo;runs-as-root-can-really-destroy-your-system&rdquo; SVGAlib. Let's look
at our algorithm.</p><p>Step one is to draw the bars. We'll make six arrays to store
our six different bars: redbar, orangebar, yellowbar, greenbar,
bluebar and purplebar. We could dynamically allocate the memory,
but why bother, since we already know the size of our graphics?
Well, it's in case we change graphic size, but let's be lazy this
time around. First, we have to set the palette properly, so we'll
do nine shades of red, nine shades of orange, nine shades of green,
nine shades of blue and nine shades of purple. A simple loop fixes
this, rendering 54 colors total, starting at palette color #192,
because it's nice to save the earlier palette colors in the event
we add something else. Once we've set the palette, we draw the red
bar in red color, store it in the redbar array, then loop through
and do the same for the other colors. When we're finished, we'll
have six bars in memory, ready to be blitted wherever we
like!</p><p>Step two is to draw the bars on the screen in our
never-ending loop of joy. We'll set a loop that increments a
variable called X, needed because the vertical positions of our
bars will be based on a sine function of X, shifting the phase a
bit for each bar so that we get a wave-like effect (instead of
having every single bar on top of the other). We'll draw the bars,
starting with purple and working toward red, hold the screen still
for a vertical refresh (usually 1/60th of a second), then clear the
screen and repeat the loop until someone exits.</p><p>Raster bars, alas, have little practical value; in fact,
they're an epitomic clich&eacute;, but I sincerely hope we can
continue this clich&eacute; into the 21st century and beyond.
Perhaps we should put raster bars in rocket ships and send them out
into the galaxy as evidence of our civilization...</p><p>&mdash;Jason Kroll</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13f5580.0x17fbc28"></a>Listing. Making Raster Bars, raster.c</h2></div></div><pre     class="programlisting">
