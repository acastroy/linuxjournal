    Mr. Hammel gives us the basics for installing and
    configuring Window Maker.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc89580.0xd81450"></a></h2></div></div><p>The source for Window Maker can be
retrieved from the primary web site at
<a href="http://windowmaker.org" target="_self">http://windowmaker.org/</a>.
You'll need two packages from this site: the source distribution
and the <span   class="bold"><b>libPropList</b></span> source
package. The latter package is a library used by Window Maker,
which you must build and install before attempting to build Window
Maker. End users probably won't refer to it much after building
Window Maker, so we'll just look at getting it installed. At the
time of this writing, the latest version of libPropList is 0.91 and
the latest version of Window Maker is 0.61.
</p><p>In order to make use of fancy graphics, you'll need the
standard set of graphics libraries: libpng, libtiff, libjpeg,
libgif and libXPM. All of these are fairly standard on newer Linux
distributions. If you have an older version (more than two years
old), you may want to check if these libraries are installed. If
not, check Freshmeat
(<a href="http://freshmeat.net" target="_self">http://freshmeat.net/</a>)
for where to find the latest versions.</p><p>One other optional library is GNU xgettext. This library is
needed only if you plan to use a language other then English, and
then only if you want the messages displayed by Window Maker to be
in that language. You won't need it, for example, if your root menu
is in French. Internationalization is a topic all to itself, and
since I have enough problems with English, I will leave it to
someone better suited to its discussion.</p><p>If you're installing from source <span   class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> you
use Red Hat, there are a few rules to follow:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Uninstall any existing Window Maker installation.
Execute these commands:</p></li></ol></div><pre     class="programlisting">
        rpm -qa | grep -i window
        rpm -e package
</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>package is the package name returned by the first
command. If no package name is returned, then skip the second
command.
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Make sure the <b  >LANG</b> and
<b  >LINGUAS</b> environment variables are not set to
<b  >en_RN</b>:</p></li></ol></div>

</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
        set | grep LANG
</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If this returns anything, then type:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
        unset LANG
</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Similarly,</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
        set | grep LINGUAS
        unset LINGUAS
</pre><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Make sure there is a link from /usr/include/X11 to
/usr/X11R6/include/X11:</p></li></ol></div><pre     class="programlisting">
        ls -ol /usr/include/X11
</pre><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If this returns &ldquo;No such file or directory&rdquo;, then
type:</p></li></ul></div><pre     class="programlisting">
        ln -s /usr/X11R6/include/X11 /usr/include/X11
</pre><p>Building is a breeze if all the prerequisites are installed.
I installed under /usr/local/WindowMaker (both the libProplist and
Window Maker packages), which required updating the /etc/ld.so.conf
file and running <span   class="bold"><b>ldconfig</b></span>
afterwards.
</p><p>We'll skip installing the graphics libraries, since most
users will probably already have these. Once you've downloaded
them, unpack the libPropList and Window Maker source packages into
their own directories using the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tar xvzf libPropList.tar.gz
tar xvzf WindowMaker-0.61.tar.gz
</pre><p>This will create directories called libPropList-0.91 and
WindowMaker-0.61. Note that the file name is dependent on whatever
the current versions are.
</p><p>In the libPropList directory, there is an editable
configuration file (plconf.h), but this probably isn't necessary.
Just run the following commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
 ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/WindowMaker
make
</pre><p>The first command configures the source to be installed under
/usr/local/WindowMaker. If you've read any of my other articles,
you'll know I install new packages in their own directories under
/usr/local. Since so many Linux applications are evolving entities,
this sort of product management makes upgrading from source code
much simpler. In this case, since I don't expect to use libPropList
for anything other than Window Maker, I'll just stuff it into the
same place I'm going to install the Window Maker files.
</p><p>Once the source has been compiled (via the
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> command), you need to change
to the root user via <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> or
<span   class="bold"><b>sudo</b></span> and run the following
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make install
</pre><p>At this point, libPropList is installed, and you will most
likely not have to deal with it any further. Be sure to exit from
the root user account.
</p><p>Building the Window Maker source is just as simple. The
configure script has many options. Although you probably won't need
to use any of these options, you should still read the INSTALL file
to be certain. Options that might be useful include
<b  >--enable-kde</b> to run Window Maker with KDE,
<b  >--enable-gnome</b> to run Window Maker with GNOME,
and <b  >--enable-sound</b> if you like annoying sounds
associated with certain actions on the desktop.</p><p>I'm not going to be using Window Maker with GNOME or KDE, so
my configure command looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/WindowMaker \
   --with-incs-from=-I/usr/local/WindowMaker \
   --with-libs-from=-L/usr/local/WindowMaker/lib
</pre><p>Note: the &ldquo;\&rdquo; is a continuation character which allows you
to spread a command over multiple lines.
</p><p>Now, we just need to build and install the package:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
make
</pre><p>Change to the root user and run:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make install
</pre>


The last step for installation of the Window Maker source package
is to make sure the Window Maker and libPropList libraries can be
found when you run the window manager. To do this, run the
following commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "/usr/local/WindowMaker/lib" &gt;&gt; \
  /etc/ld.so.conf
ldconfig
</pre>


The first command appends the directory name to the end of the
ld.so.conf configuration file. The second command tells the
operating system to reload that configuration because a change was
made.
</p><p>The last three commands were all run as root, so now you can
exit from the root user back to your normal user account.</p><p>The next step is to install the Window Maker data package,
which includes a set of pixmaps for use with Window Maker. This
package requires manual installation by copying the pixmaps to the
proper directory. Change to the WindowMaker-data directory (after
unpacking it). If you installed Window Maker in the default
directory, /usr/local, then you can use the following
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cp -r pixmaps /usr/local/share
</pre><p>In our case, we installed under /usr/local/WindowMaker, so
we'd use a command like this instead:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cp -r pixmaps /usr/local/WindowMaker/share
</pre>


Finally, make sure the Window Maker binaries and scripts can be
found by adding them to your PATH environment variable:
<pre     class="programlisting">
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/WindowMaker/bin
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc89580.0x117af60"></a>The First Time</h2></div></div><p>Now that you have Window Maker installed, it's time to see
what you're getting. Before starting the window manager for the
first time, you need to run
<span   class="bold"><b>wmaker.inst</b></span>, a script that should
be in the bin directory of the installation
(/usr/local/WindowMaker/bin in my case) to set up your user ID to
use WindowMaker. This script will check for the presence of
&ldquo;wmaker&rdquo; in your .xinitrc, .Xsession and .Xclients files using a
simple <span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> command. If the script
finds such an entry, it assumes WindowMaker is your default window
manager. This isn't necessarily the case (my .Xclients, for
example, includes a reference to
<span   class="bold"><b>wmaker</b></span> that won't actually launch
the window manager), so you may need to configure it manually in
order to use wmaker.</p><p>There are many ways to configure your login to use a
particular window manager or X application at startup. In the
previous article in this series, I discussed the use of the
.Xclients file. Let's review this process very briefly (if you need
a more detailed description, see the previous article on
Enlightenment).</p><p>All Linux distributions use some script interface to a
program called <span   class="bold"><b>xinit</b></span> to start your
X session. These scripts will, if they are the standard scripts
that have been used for years, eventually run your .Xclients file
to launch applications and your window manager. Therefore, the
simplest method of getting Window Maker to be your default window
manager is to create a file called .Xclients in your
<b  >$HOME</b> directory. Chances are this file doesn't
exist yet (unless you created it once before). Add a single line to
it:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
wmaker
</pre><p>Note that you do not want to place this command in the
background. For example, <b  >wmaker&amp;</b> would be
incorrect; this would cause your X session to start up and then
immediately exit. You also do not need to specify which shell to
use when this script is run. Many scripts begin with something like
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/sh
</pre>


but .Xclients does not need to have such a line.
</p><p>Once you've created (or modified) your .Xclients file, you're
ready to start up Window Maker for the first time. How you do this
depends on your distribution, but I log in using an ordinary text
console, then type <span   class="bold"><b>startx</b></span> to get
things running. If you use a graphical login, you may need to log
out and then log back in.</p><p>The first time you start Window Maker, it will create a set
of directories for you under $HOME/GNUstep. These directories are
where you manage menus and themes. The sidebar describes what
you'll find in these directories. Unless otherwise specified, you
shouldn't edit these files by hand. Most have graphical interfaces,
such as using an application's &ldquo;Title Bar Attributes&rdquo; menu option
or the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; menu option for a docked applications
icon.</p><p><a href="4050s1.html" target="_self">GNUstep Directories</a></p><p>If you are running Window Maker using a language other than
English, you can switch to language-specific menu files. The
INSTALL file in the source distribution describes how to set it up
for using alternate languages.</p><p>Now you are ready to run. More about Window Maker can be
found in my article &ldquo;Artist's Guide to the Desktop, Part 3&rdquo; in
this month's print magazine.</p></div></div>
