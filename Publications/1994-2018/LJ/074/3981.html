    Is Linux ready for the casual user? Mr. Shirky begins an
    experiment to find out.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfba580.0x10b25b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Several months ago, I bought some clothes
with my LinuxFund credit card. The guy behind the counter looked at
the card and said, &ldquo;Linux! That's the future, right?&rdquo; He then
leaned over the counter and asked &ldquo;What do you think is going to
happen to the PC?&rdquo;
</p><p>The biggest single change in that loose amalgam that is the
&ldquo;Linux community&rdquo; in the last year is that it now includes
people, many thousands of people, who have heard about Linux in the
press and liked what they've heard, but don't know anyone who uses
it. The old model for the spread of Linux&mdash;you tell two friends and
they tell two friends&mdash;is over, because the press attention has
spread news of Linux <span   class="emphasis"><em>far</em></span> outside the community
of actual users, to the point where a random cashier in an
unrelated business feels confident of its revolutionary impact,
even without any direct experience with the OS itself. For these
interested-but-unconnected people to become Linux users, they will
have to work harder than any of the Old Guard did, because they
don't know anyone with enough experience to help them. They will
have to find their way to Linux more or less from scratch.</p><p>I was reminded of my encounter with the Linux-loving cashier
a few weeks ago when Almaz, my wife, decided that she was writing
too much to keep working on her laptop and wanted a desktop. All
she needed to do on the desktop, she said, was use Netscape,
WordPerfect and a printer. And so an experiment was born, an
experiment to see whether, armed with only a credit card and a
willing Windows user, one could buy a complete Linux desktop system
with a printer which that user could set up and get started with on
their own. Almaz, who uses a computer every day but has no burning
desire to understand what goes on under the hood, seemed to be the
ideal test candidate.</p><p>This experiment is really two questions rolled into one. The
first obvious question is, &ldquo;Have the recent improvements in
usability created a Linux which a casual user would feel
comfortable with?&rdquo; The second and less obvious question is, &ldquo;Are
there companies thinking about how to package and deliver such
systems to interested home users?&rdquo; Since I needed to procure the
system before testing it, I set out to answer the second question
first.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfba580.0x10b2818"></a>Phase 1&mdash;Needle in a Haystack: Finding a Linux
Vendor</h2></div></div><p>To begin, where to find this mythical, pre-configured desktop
system? Although I have bought several systems with Linux
pre-installed from several different vendors, they were all web
servers. In this case, looking for a desktop system, I was almost
as much of a newbie as my wife was. I set out down three different
paths&mdash;using a search engine (Yahoo!, in this case), going to the
major Windows PC vendors to see if any of them would ship a PC with
Linux, and going straight for Linux URLs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfba580.0x10b2920"></a>Search Engine</h2></div></div><p>Reasoning that average users would have little idea of where
to turn for pre-installed systems, I went straight for Yahoo!,
usually a beacon of clarity in the fog of the Web. Yahoo! did not
disappoint in this regard, with a manageable 22 categories which
included the word &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;. But of these, only three categories
were links to hardware vendors. Furthermore, two of those three
were specifically business-to-business, leaving me only the
slightly off-putting &ldquo;/Hardware/Custom_Built_PCs/Linux/&rdquo; as a
category.</p><p>The problem with this category is that there's no such thing
as a &ldquo;custom-built&rdquo; computer anymore&mdash;in the age of Dell,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> computers are custom-built. Customers of
commodity PCs expect to be able to adjust the configuration to
their taste, and they don't think of this as buying a
&ldquo;custom-built PC&rdquo;; they just think of this as buying a PC,
period. A big part of serving interested but inexperienced users is
creating a sense that they are not going to be bombarded with too
many choices, but no one selling Linux systems has figured that out
yet.</p><p>Yahoo! included a scant nine sites which advertised Linux
hardware, and these were not always listed in the most
user-friendly terms. Would you send a want-to-be Linux user to a
site advertising itself as &ldquo;a Linux-centric systems integrator
offering support, hardware, applications, development and
services&rdquo;? Nevertheless, these sites went on the master list. Time
for the next strategy: going straight for the traditional PC
retailers.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfba580.0x10b2b30"></a>The Majors</h2></div></div><p>The second strategy I pursued was going after existing PC
vendors. I had heard that Dell, Compaq, HP and IBM had all
&ldquo;embraced&rdquo; Linux, though I wasn't really sure what that meant and
visiting their web sites provided few additional clues. While a
search for &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; on all four sites turned up thousands of pages
of documents, FAQs and press releases talking up their commitment
to Linux, I was unable to find out, using only their web sites,
whether they would sell me a Linux desktop system or not. In all
four cases I had to resort to the phone, and in three of the four
cases, Compaq, HP and IBM, I was told they sell Linux only on
servers.</p><p>Dell, as usual, was a bit further along than its competition,
and sells high-end Linux PCs, but the base price is over $2000, too
high for a casual user's desktop. Furthermore, this option isn't
even listed in the Home and Home Office section, only in the
Business Users section, which would be daunting for newbies.</p><p>Nevertheless, if desktop Linux becomes a reality, Dell will
be the company to beat. In my conversations with them, they always
put me in touch with knowledgeable staff and they never
sugar-coated anything, telling me, for example, that printer setup
was likely to be &ldquo;quirky&rdquo;. I opted not to buy what was really a
business-class workstation for Almaz, but when and if Linux for the
desktop becomes a reality, Dell is better positioned to take
advantage of it than any other Windows PC vendor. Everything they
do is geared toward making the customer feel comfortable about
making a decision.</p><p>So it's a strike-out with the traditional PC vendors. Time
for the last strategy: going straight for Linux URLs.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfba580.0x10b2d40"></a>Linux URLs</h2></div></div><p>In terms of newbie reach, what's the most valuable piece of
Linux real estate on the Web? (Hint: it isn't Slashdot.) It's
Linux.com, the Linux portal owned by VA Linux Systems, because end
users typically think of dot-com sites as the Web's anchor tenants.
Linux.com is a beautifully simple piece of web design, but as with
so many sites, it suffers from insideritis. Clicking on
&ldquo;Desktops&rdquo;, for example, gets you a page with a bewildering array
of conversations about KDE vs. GNOME, but nothing at all about how
you could buy a Linux desktop. Clicking on &ldquo;Get Linux&rdquo; gets you a
page of every Linux distribution out there, but again, no
information about actually getting a computer running one of these
distributions. Searching for the word &ldquo;PC&rdquo; brings up page after
page of BBS flames about Windows 98 vs. Linux, but yet again,
nothing for the user who wants to buy a Linux PC.</p><p>Linux.com has no obvious, Yahoo!-like list of Linux system
vendors. I have no way of knowing if this is a simple omission, or
if VA Linux refuses to list competitors on a site it owns, but it
seems like a huge oversight to host the single most valuable Linux
URL from the outside world's point of view without directing
interested users to places where they can actually buy a computer
running Linux.</p><p>The problem here is that ordinary users don't buy operating
systems. They buy computers. If there is ever to be a real spread
of Linux to casual users, it will mean a move from a focus on this
or that Linux distribution to a focus on pre-installed systems.
Vendors will have to drop the idea that someday the average user
will be comfortable installing an operating system&mdash;they don't even
like to install ordinary software, so no matter how easy an OS
install can be, it will never be as easy as buying it
pre-installed. As the size of the Linux user base grows, the number
of people who are comfortable installing from scratch will grow in
absolute numbers, but will shrink dramatically in total market
share. Whoever focuses on selling Linux computers rather than Linux
distributions will win in the long haul.</p><p>Abandoning Linux.com, I went on to Linux.org (though I am
convinced that most end users would not take this step on their
own), and finally hit pay dirt.</p><p>Linux.org has the most complete list of vendors of Linux
systems I have found anywhere, with almost 80 vendors listed in the
U.S. alone. However, the list is hard to use, as it's in no
particular order and has spotty information about what the vendors
do. Furthermore, it looks like a prototypical web site circa 1996,
with lots of white space between entries for &ldquo;readability&rdquo;,
meaning that you can't see more than a handful of vendors at any
one time, wrecking the ability to do any comparison
shopping.</p><p>Nevertheless, this (plus a few sites from the Yahoo! list) is
clearly the best source of vendors I'm going to find. Phase 1 is
now done: I have gone from a standing stop to a long list of Linux
system vendors to check out. Elapsed time: 48 hours. Frustration
quotient: medium to high. Amount of work required: much too high.
Phase 2 will be evaluating the sites themselves, and Phase 3 will
be road-testing the ease of setup and use for whatever system we
buy.</p><p>As a side effect of looking though these sites, it became
clear to me that as the user base spreads, pre-installation will
trump ease of use for determining which flavor of Linux users
choose, and by this measure, Red Hat is <span   class="emphasis"><em>way</em></span>
out in front. No matter how easy the Caldera or Corel distributions
are (the two easiest installs in my experience), the real trump
card in terms of growth in user base will be deals with hardware
vendors. Surprisingly, no home page for any Linux distribution I
looked at (Red Hat, Corel, Caldera, Debian, Mandrake) had what I
thought would be an obvious link: a big red button that said
&ldquo;Click here to buy a computer running FooBar Linux from our
partners&rdquo;. The owners of different distributions are still
assuming that most users will install their own Linux and, though
that may be true for the moment, it will not be for long.</p><p>Conclusion: On a scale from &ldquo;Rough&rdquo; to &ldquo;Smooth&rdquo;, Phase 1
surely counts as rough. For someone interested in using a Linux box
as a casual user, but with no idea where to turn, there is no
obvious answer about where to look first. This bootstrap problem,
where you have to know where to look before you do the looking, is
the Achilles heel of easy-to-use Linux right now. While it is
unclear whether Linux will ever make any real inroads into the MS
desktop monopoly, if the software were ready tomorrow, interested
users still couldn't find it. As we have learned from Amazon, eBay
and Yahoo!, this means that if this space ever does take off, the
first vendor to associate themselves firmly in the Web's collective
mind as the official vendor of Linux desktops could walk away with
a lion's share of the traffic. Next month, we'll evaluate Linux
systems vendors.</p></div></div>
