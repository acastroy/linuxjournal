article, are the unquestioned staple that have brought the masses
to computing. More man years have been wasted playing solitaire or
other games over the last decade than on most other non-productive
pursuits. Obviously, this is not why computers are so popular with
business. Originally, spreadsheets were the reason for computers.
Later, databases also provided a lot of the impetus for buying
systems (at least the larger systems; smaller systems were used
primarily for word processing). Today, with most companies enjoying
Internet connections, most employees of almost any size business
will tell you they use their systems mostly for e-mail. From senior
management to secretaries, e-mail has redefined how companies do
business. This also applies to individuals. You can send just about
anything via e-mail, including money. So I'll devote half of this
article to e-mail. In fact, I could devote several articles to
e-mail, so I'll restrict this to some of the better new MUAs (Mail
User Agent) I've found.
</p><p>neomail:
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/neomail" target="_self">http://www.sourceforge.net/neomail/</a></p><p>With <span   class="bold"><b>neomail</b></span>, you can read
your mail in a web browser (secure server) if you want. It has
support for an address list, and you can specify how large (in KB)
the list can be to keep users from getting carried away. You can
import a comma-separated value (.csv) file into the address list,
which is handy if you're coming from Outlook or Netscape Mail. With
this MUA, if you can connect to the Internet, you can read,
compose, delete, forward, file and generally handle your mail. It
requires Apache, Perl, suidperl, Perl CGI module and sendmail or
exim.</p><p>cscmail:
<a href="http://cyberdeck.org/cscmail" target="_self">http://cyberdeck.org/cscmail/</a></p><p>This particular mail client claims to be a clone of Outlook
Express. I've never used OE, so I don't know if it lives up to that
claim, but it is a well-done mail client that includes drag and
drop, easy filters for sorting, mail folders, address lists and
more&mdash;all in a Perl-GTK wrapper. The most difficult part was
installing the Gtk::Perl module, which requires you to build the
main part and several subparts. It requires gtk, GtkXmHTML, Perl
and the following Perl modules: DBI, Text::CSV_XS, SQL::Statement,
DBD::CSV, DateManip, Mail::Sender, HTML::Parser, Gtk::Perl and
Mail::POP3Client.</p><p>Twig:
<a href="http://screwdriver.net/twig" target="_self">http://screwdriver.net/twig/</a></p><p>Twig does a very good job with mail. But Twig does more than
just mail, it also attempts to be a Personal Information Manager
(PIM) by providing you with a Contacts list, a Schedule, a ToDo
list, Bookmarks and access to News servers. The schedule is an
appointment list and provides a small calendar on the side. Within
Twig, you can create groups for information sharing. This does a
very nice job for an office or workgroup and includes support for
various databases. It requires MySQL (or Postgres or Oracle) and
Apache with PHP3 that includes support for IMAP.</p><p>AeroMail:
<a href="http://the.cushman.net/reverb/aeromail" target="_self">http://the.cushman.net/reverb/aeromail/</a></p><p>AeroMail is a very spartan mail reader that will allow you to
read, compose, file and delete messages, but very little more. No
address books or contact lists are included&mdash;it's simply fast and
efficient. If you don't want to give your users space for an
address book, you'll like this mail client. It requires Apache with
PHP3 that includes support for IMAP.</p><p>tnef:
<a href="http://world.std.com/~damned/tnef-latest.tar.gz" target="_self">world.std.com/~damned/tnef-latest.tar.gz</a></p><p>Bugged by those absurd, non-standard tnef files Microsoft
likes to pollute e-mail with? This little utility will allow you to
read them if you're wondering what's in there. It requires
glibc.</p><p>apachedb:
<a href="http://www.goofy.gaudi.dhs.org" target="_self">http://www.goofy.gaudi.dhs.org/</a></p><p>Need something to track usage of your website(s)?
<span   class="bold"><b>apacheDB</b></span> allows you to register
all hits in a MySQL database and uses PHP3 to query the database
for agents, hits, referrers, usage and more. You can convert your
present access_log into the database and continue from there, if
you wish. It displays hits graphically as well as numerically. You
may need to make some small modifications to the script if you
don't use the combined logs, but the author has some examples. Your
marketdroids will love this tool, and your CFO will like the price.
It requires MySQL, Apache with PHP3 support, Perl, Perl modules
DBI, DBI::DBD and Entry.</p><p>mozart:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2466" target="_self">sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=2466</a></p><p>Mozart is a start on a PIM. While not all areas are
completely functional, and some work needs to be done on
aesthetics, the major areas are all in place. This PIM is designed
to be used by a group and currently supports Contacts, Calendar,
ToDo list and Appointments. It requires a web server with PHP
support, MySQL and a web browser.</p><p>MultiNet:
<a href="http://users.capitolonline.nl/~nlco5954/multinet" target="_self">http://users.capitolonline.nl/~nlco5954/multinet/</a></p><p>Do you carry a laptop back and forth between home and work?
Both sites have their own network? Both have different network
setups? If you answered yes to the above questions, you might want
to check out MultiNet. This little utility takes care of
configuring (or reconfiguring) the network for you. It will at
least save you manual configuration of each location. Can be
launched from a command line or from your rc scripts at bootup. It
requires /bin/sh and dialog (slated for rewrite in Perl).</p><p>wakeup:
<a href="http://soul.apk.net/wakeup" target="_self">http://soul.apk.net/wakeup/</a></p><p>This small utility will provide you with a wakeup call at the
time of your choosing, to the music of your choice. Provided, of
course, you have an MP3 for it to play. It requires Perl, mpg123
and at.</p></div></div>
