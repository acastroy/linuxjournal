    In this episode, Mr. Hammel tells us about the Window Maker
    window manager, a less flashy but more mature product than
    Enlightenment.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c7580.0x16bf5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Window Maker is a descendent of the
GNUStep project. GNUStep is, in a sense, more like GNOME and KDE
than Window Maker. GNUStep attempts to provide underlying features
of the desktop&mdash;features which are not visual, but functional.
Window Maker includes some of this functionality, but is more akin
to Enlightenment, a window manager, than GNOME, a desktop
environment. Designed for additional integration support of GNUStep
applications, Window Maker takes its look from NeXTSTEP, the
desktop interface from the Apple-devoured NeXT company, one of
Steve Jobs' post (and pre)-Apple projects.
</p><p>Window Maker includes support for running as the window
manager in KDE, GNOME and Open Look (yet another environment,
although you aren't likely to see it on Linux). The KDE support
appears more complete than the GNOME support (which tends to be a
bit of a moving target at times). The source distribution contains
README files describing how to use the window manager in both KDE
and GNOME. Window Maker has some of its own session management
capabilities, but does not directly provide drag-and drop-between
applications.</p><p>Again, we'll assume you already have Window Maker installed.
If not, instructions can be found in my article &ldquo;Installing Window
Maker&rdquo; in &ldquo;Strictly On-Line&rdquo;,
<a href="../074/4050.html" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue74/4050.html</a>.
Be sure you have version 0.61 or the latest release.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c7580.0x16bf7c0"></a>Touring the Desktop</h2></div></div><p>The first time Window Maker starts, you'll see a display
similar to Figure 1. This is the default screen display, which
isn't that fancy, initially. Unlike Enlightenment, Window Maker
doesn't presume any graphical pizzazz on your part. It lets you
define it right from the start.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3986f1.large.jpg"><img src="3986f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. The Default Window Maker
Display</p></div></div>
</p><p>Note that on my desktop, I use the XPM-based default icons
(see Figure 1), whereas on my laptop, I used the TIFF-based default
icons. I never could get the TIFF-based version, which has much
nicer icons, to work properly on my desktop even though the desktop
and laptop systems are configured&mdash;as far as I can tell&mdash;exactly
the same. This is a negative mark for Window Maker. Neither FVWM2
(my normal window manager) nor Enlightenment exhibits this sort of
problem.</p><p>Figure 1 shows three important pieces of the Window Maker
desktop: appicons, the clip and the dock. Window Maker uses icons
in two distinct ways: as appicons and as mini-windows. This is
another terminology dance we users have to play, as developers
struggle with ways to define the complex to the uninitiated. Don't
let it worry you much. The images along the right side of Figure 1
are appicons. They represent a running application whose windows
can be open or iconicized. This differs from a mini-window, which
is what you get if you iconicized a window. Click on the small box
on the upper left of a window, and the window collapses into a
mini-window. Visually, you can tell the difference between a
mini-window and an appicon, as the mini-window has a tiny title bar
in it, as shown in Figure 2.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3986f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Appicon and Mini-window
</p></div></div><p>Appicons (see Figure 2) are created each time you start a new
application from a command line. This is different behavior from
most other window managers, and I initially found it annoying.
Fortunately, you can change this behavior by using the Dock, which
I'll discuss in the section on managing the desktop.</p><p>In the upper left corner of Figure 1 is the Clip. This is
essentially the pager for Window Maker, although it lacks the
visual cues that other pagers provide. It also has some special
behaviors when used with appicons. Dragging an appicon onto the
clip connects the icon to the clip for the current workspace (see
Figure 3). After a moment, unless you keep the mouse over the clip
icon, the icon you just connected to it will be hidden. This allows
you to use drag-and-drop to place applications on a particular
desktop, plus it hides all those nasty appicons. The clip is a tool
for managing which applications are on which desktop.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3986f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. The Clip with Appicons &ldquo;Attracted&rdquo;
</p></div></div><p>This leads to another issue: Window Maker doesn't have
desktops. It doesn't have pages, either. Instead, it has
workspaces. More terminology, but in this case, it's not needed. A
workspace is the same thing as a desktop. Unlike E (Enlightenment)
or FVWM2, Window Maker doesn't have multiple pages for each
desktop. It just has an unlimited number of desktops connected in a
sort of linear&mdash;left to right&mdash;pattern.</p><p>Dragging windows between workspaces is configurable using the
Preferences utility (discussed in more detail later). Drag to the
left or right edge to get to the next workspace. You can warp
(i.e., jump) a window to another workspace by using the window's
Title Bar menu &ldquo;Move To...&rdquo; option. When you get to the edge of
the last window, you can't drag past the right edge unless you
configure in the Preferences utility to wrap back to the first
workspace or to create a new workspace&mdash;either is configurable. The
same thing applies when trying to drag to the left edge of the
first workspace.</p><p>Adding new workspaces can be done by clicking with the middle
mouse button (normally mapped to both buttons on a two-button
mouse) on the Clip. This brings up a menu, the first item of which
is &ldquo;New&rdquo;. A right mouse click on the Clip brings up a menu for
managing the current workspace, from renaming it to grabbing all
appicons to managing how icons are displayed.</p><p>When switching workspaces with the Clip, the name of the
workspace you've switched to is shown in the center of the display
(over any windows, if necessary): it then fades from view. This is
a cute trick that happens to be a bit useful as well. It's nice to
know the name of the workspace you just entered.</p><p>Over on the top right side of Figure 1, you'll see the Dock.
This is a special application that manages appicons. This is the
place to add appicons to launch applications. It's similar to the
GoodStuff bar in FVWM2, or less similarly, to the panels in KDE and
GNOME.</p><p>Using the Dock is a little confusing at first. Let's walk
through an example of adding an appicon to the Dock, so we can
start xterms at will. The first thing to do is open an xterm
manually, which you can do by right-clicking on the root window to
get the root menu. The third item down should be &ldquo;XTerm&rdquo;. Click
on it. A generic black text on a white background xterm should
open, and its appicon placed in the lower left of the screen.
Left-click on the appicon and drag it up under the appicons under
the Dock. When you're close enough, a white box is displayed under
the icon, and when you let go of the mouse button, the xterm's
appicon is neatly positioned under the other icons.</p><p>Now you have an icon that will always be there (you can
remove it manually later) when you start up your X session. Right
now, its application&mdash;the xterm&mdash;is already running. Exit out of
the xterm by typing &ldquo;exit&rdquo; at the command prompt or clicking on
the &ldquo;x&rdquo; in the upper right corner of the xterm window. Notice the
xterm's appicon now has three small dots in its lower left corner.
That means you can start an xterm by double-clicking on the
appicon. If you do this now, the xterm opens again and those dots
disappear.</p><p>The problem here is that you can't open more than one xterm.
You have to configure the appicon, while it's docked, to allow for
more than one instance of the xterm to be started. Here is how you
do that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>If it's not open, open an xterm by double-clicking
on the docked appicon.</p></li><li><p>Right-click on the title bar and choose
&ldquo;Attributes&rdquo; from the menu.</p></li><li><p>In the &ldquo;Inspecting...&rdquo; dialog, select the
&ldquo;Application Specific&rdquo; option.</p></li><li><p>Click on the &ldquo;No Application Icon&rdquo; button, then
click on &ldquo;Save&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Click on the &ldquo;Close&rdquo; button (the X in the upper
right) of the &ldquo;Inspecting...&rdquo; dialog to close that window.</p></li></ul></div><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3986f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 4. Turning Off the Application
Icon</p></div></div>
</p><p>Now you should be able to launch multiple xterms from the
single terminal icon hanging off the Dock. This process works for
any appicon you connect to the Dock.</p><p>If you want to remove an appicon from the Dock, just click
and drag it down to the bottom of the screen and let go; it will
disappear. First, make sure you've closed all instances of the
application started with that icon, however.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c7580.0x16c08f0"></a>Figure 5. The Default Dock Applications</h2></div></div><p>The default Dock applications are shown in Figure 5. The top
one is the Dock itself. The next one down will launch generic
xterms. The last one opens the Window Maker Preferences utility.
The icons you see may differ if you are using the TIFF-based icons
instead of the XPM-based icons.</p><p>Root and window menus can be partially displayed off-screen
depending on where you open them, but you can scroll them back into
view by moving the mouse pointer to the edge of the screen (while
over the menu) and holding it there for a moment. You can see this
by right-clicking near the left or right edge of the
display.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c7580.0x16c0a50"></a>Figure 6. Example of Themed Root Menus</h2></div></div><p>In the default root menu (see Figure 6), the entry
&ldquo;Preferences Utility&rdquo; under &ldquo;Appearance&rdquo; didn't work for me.
That's because I changed the default installation directory (using
<b  >--prefix</b> when I built from the source). To fix
this, edit the file $HOME/GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/menu and
comment out the line for &ldquo;Preferences Utility&rdquo;. You don't
actually need this if you use the Application Dock. The last icon
on the dock in the default configuration, the one with the
heartbeat line, will launch the Preferences Utility
correctly.</p><p>Clicking in the title bar of a root menu will anchor it&mdash;the
menu gets a close button in the upper right, and doesn't close when
the other menus are closed. To close it, click on the Close
button.</p><p>There is a tool in the Preferences Utility for managing the
root menu graphically, but if you use it, you lose access to the
text-based versions of the menus. The graphical tool converts the
text-based menu into a sort of compiled format. For moderately
intelligent users, the text-based menus are quicker to update, and
for internationalized menus, you are required to use the text-based
menus&mdash;internationalized menus can't be managed using the graphical
utility. Making manual changes to the text menus does not require
restarting Window Maker; the changes are recognized the next time
you open the root menu. If you choose to use the graphical
interface for menu management, its updates are also recognized
immediately.</p><p>The default root menu is GNUstep/Library/WindowMaker/menu.
This single file holds all the menus you see hanging off the Root
Menu (the Applications, Editors and Miscellaneous menus, for
example). To add or delete entries from these menus, just edit this
file using your favorite text editor. The root menus will get
updated automatically once you save the file back to disk.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c7580.0x16c0cb8"></a>Desktop Management</h2></div></div><p>Now you know what you're seeing on-screen. The next step is
to decide what to do with all of this. Many of Window Maker's
features have equivalent counterparts in Enlightenment, such as
shaded windows: double-click the title bar to shade the window,
again to open it back up. Windows can be grouped in E using manual
configuration. In Window Maker, you have to select windows.
Left-click in the root window, hold and drag over the windows you
want to group. You can now drag these windows to another desktop.
To unselect them, just left-click once in the root window.</p><p>Moving between desktops is easy: simply type
<b  >ALT-#</b>, where <b  >#</b> is the desktop
number as shown in the Clip. This is a fast way of bouncing around
your desktops, something I can't currently do in my window manager,
FVWM2. You can also move between desktops using the root menu
Workspace submenu, the Clip menu, and, if it's enabled, by moving
the mouse to the left and right edges of the display.</p><p>As you've seen, an important part of the Window Maker desktop
is the Dock. It allows you to launch applications quickly. It can
also be used by special Dock Applications, small programs (similar
to E's epplets) that run right in the icon. Examples of these
programs include clocks, system information, stock and weather
reports and a chess game (see Figure 7).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c7580.0x16b77b0"></a>Figure 7. Some Sample Dock Applications</h2></div></div><p>Docked applications can launch multiple instances of an
application using the technique described earlier. Some
applications don't behave properly under Window Maker, however, and
you can't disable their application icon, so that technique won't
work. Never fear: there are alternate ways to launch multiple
instances. The simplest is to use the Launch option in the docked
appicons menus (right-click on a docked appicon). Selecting Launch
will open another instance of that application. Alternatively, you
can change the command to run in the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; dialog, also from
the docked appicons menu. For example, XV is normally launched as
<span   class="bold"><b>xv</b></span>. This gets changed to</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/bin/sh -c "exec xv&amp;"
</pre><p>Now, a double click on the XV appicon in the dock will launch
a new instance of XV every time.
</p><p>There are many dock applications available for Window Maker.
The primary web site for finding these is the DockApps Repository
at
<a href="http://www.bensinclair.com/dockapp" target="_self">http://www.bensinclair.com/dockapp/</a>.</p><p>You can also find a number of interesting icons and themes
plus various bits of useful documentation at
<a href="http://wm.current.nu" target="_self">http://wm.current.nu/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c7580.0x16b7b20"></a>Image is Everything</h2></div></div><p>Window Maker doesn't permit quite as much variation to the
window border system as Enlightenment does, but this actually
simplifies the creation and use of themes. The last item in the
default menu, &ldquo;Appearance&rdquo;, allows you to access some predefined
themes and styles (essentially the same thing, from a user's
perspective). The Preferences Utility is used to make specific
changes to window borders and backgrounds, after which you select
the Appearance<b  >--&gt;</b>Save Theme option to save
those settings.</p><p>The Preferences Utility is not what you use to set the
background, however. To set the background image, you use the
<span   class="bold"><b>wmsetbg</b></span> program. Unfortunately,
there doesn't appear to be a way to choose files randomly for
setting the background built into the default configuration. You'll
have to add entries to the root menus for each image you wish to
use as a background. On the plus side, once you've set the
background for a given workspace, you can save the setting so that
it's always used in the future.</p><p>The Window Maker Preferences Utility (see Figure 8) is the
heart of configuration for the look and feel of WM. All visual
settings are configured here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Animations can be disabled here. Useful for
memory-limited systems like laptops.</p></li><li><p>Icons can be sized up or down from their default
64x64 size.</p></li><li><p>You can configure extra paths to search for pixmaps
and icons.</p></li><li><p>Many keyboard shortcuts are configurable by using a
graphical interface. This is very useful for someone like me. On my
laptop for instance, I have one of those post mice (IBM-style
red-capped post). I hate it, and I don't like moving back and forth
to my real mouse on my desktop, either. I prefer just bouncing
around using the keyboard when possible. Being able to configure
these shortcuts easily is a welcome feature.</p></li><li><p>The mouse is fully configurable, too. You can
specify which mouse button will open menus, how fast the mouse
responds to double clicks and so forth. This is a very useful but
seldom provided feature for window managers. It's especially nice
that it has a graphical interface.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c7580.0x16b8150"></a>Figure 8. The Window Maker Preferences
Utility</h2></div></div><p>The Window Maker Preferences Utility, known simply as WPrefs,
is also used to configure the backgrounds, window borders, title
bars and icons to use for specific windows. You can't get as
creative as you can with E, but the interface for making changes is
fairly sophisticated and rather intuitive. As I mentioned before,
the only thing it doesn't do is set the background image of the
root window, which must be done manually using wmsetbg.</p><p>Some changes made using the WPrefs utility are immediate,
while others require restarting Window Maker to take effect. Things
like icon sizes, window auto-focus and window auto-raise all
require restarting the window manager. The
Exit<b  >--&gt;</b>Restart menu option in the Root Menu
will restart Window Maker without requiring you to exit your X
sessions.</p><p>Until I discovered how to resize the icons, I really hated
Window Maker. I'm a minimalist at heart; my FVWM2 configuration
uses very little screen space for the GoodStuff bar. The large
icons are annoying to me, so I resize them down quite a bit. This
has a drawback, however. Since clocks are docked appicons, they
tend to require lots of space in order for me to see the clock
analog hands or digital text. Similarly, many of the dock
applications require at least a 64x64 appicon, or else you can't
read their contents. In other words, they're cute, but they take up
too much space for my taste.</p><p>One other thing about Window Maker is it supports sound. I
don't like my computer making noises at me. That's why I have a
stereo; I pipe CDs played on the computer through the stereo, so I
don't use the sound features found in Window Maker or other window
managers. However, sound support is there, if you want it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c7580.0x16b83b8"></a>Performance</h2></div></div><p>As with my Enlightenment testing, I ran Window Maker on two
systems: a 400MHz AMD K6 desktop with 256MB memory and a 200MHz
Celeron laptop with 32MB memory. Both systems ran stock Red Hat 5.2
using glibc 2.0. I also ran with the latest release of Window
Maker, namely the 0.61.1 release. Performance on the desktop was
good in all cases. Performance on the laptop was nearly as good,
although a little jumpy in a few places.</p><p>Window Maker is a little less resource-intensive than
Enlightenment, mostly because Window Maker doesn't provide the wild
window borders you can get with Enlightenment. That feature of E is
visually stimulating, but also memory-intensive.</p><p>I found that Window Maker performed quite well on my laptop,
certainly as good if not better than Enlightenment. Opaque window
moves are the default and require constant redraws. This wasn't so
noticeable on the desktop, but was obvious on the laptop. Opaque
moves are fairly slow to update and make WM appear to be sluggish,
but in reality it's not really bogged down by such movements. This
can be turned off, forcing transparent (outline only) moves which
give the appearance of much better performance.</p><p>Window shading was not very smooth on the laptop, even with
the fast speed set. I found it worked much better if I turned off
the animations on my laptop. When I double-clicked on the title
bar, the window (except for the title bar) just disappeared.
Double-click on the title bar again, and it comes back. Since this
happens very quickly, it makes it appear as if the system is
working more efficiently.</p><p>Animations, including 3-D animations for iconizing windows,
were generally fairly smooth. Neither shading nor animations are as
smooth as on my desktop, but neither is slow enough to be
distracting or prevent me from doing other work. The bells and
whistles of Window Maker can all be turned off, so performance
shouldn't be a big issue for laptops.</p><p>Running Netscape and GIMP on my laptop with Window Maker was
no problem. Of course, very large GIMP files will bog down any
system, so I just worked on small web-sized images. Still, Window
Maker ran quite well.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c7580.0x16b8678"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>There is actually a fair amount of documentation available
for Window Maker. A user's guide for a previous release is on-line,
but it's not quite up to date with the latest (0.61.1) release. A
FAQ in text form comes with the source distribution, and an HTML
version is available on-line from both the main Window Maker site
(<a href="http://www.windowmaker.org" target="_self">http://www.windowmaker.org/</a>)
and a few other user-supported sites. Man pages for all tools
included in the source distribution are also available.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x15c7580.0x16b87d8"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Window Maker has many nice features. For artists, Window
Maker makes personalizing the desktop very simple. Themes are easy
to create, easy to save and easy to install. This leaves the artist
time to focus on the creative side&mdash;the creation of the tiles,
backgrounds and other images used in the desktop. That's the way a
desktop should work.</p><p>Window Maker also has many things I don't like. The icons are
too big, initially. Since most Dock applications expect to be
running in 64x64 icons, my laptop screen space is compromised. I
can scale these down, but I lose the functionality in the dock
appicons. I also don't like having the dock appicons running along
the right side of my display. I like them along the top of the
display, and I couldn't figure out how to change this
orientation.</p><p>The lack of a visual pager is also a drawback. Although
pagers take up screen space (and you'd think I would hate that),
their usefulness far outweighs their size. The Clip is helpful, but
not as much as the pagers you can get with Enlightenment or
FVWM2.</p><p>Most importantly, I never iconize anything under FVWM2, so
all this icon twiddling in Window Maker is a bit annoying to me. I
far prefer configurable menu bars, like FVWM2's GoodStuff, where I
can use very small icons (mostly for visual appeal) but still have
quick access to many different applications.</p><p>Despite its drawbacks, Window Maker is a solid performer in
various environments. It supports both KDE and GNOME and has a very
easy-to-use graphical configuration tool. Themes are a breeze to
create and save.</p><p>The main web site for Window Maker is a good place to get
started, but it lacks any real details. The man page is
well-written, with lots of details on what directories are used and
what they are used for. Most of the truly useful information you'll
find on the Web will be at user sites.</p><p>Window Maker is available precompiled in most Linux
distributions these days. You don't have to build from source, but
it's fairly easy to do so. There are few external requirements to
get it running. This is how Window Maker differs from E: you can
skip the need to know about compiling and installing software from
source, something that Enlightenment depends on in its current
state.</p><p>I like Window Maker, but between it and Enlightenment, I
still prefer the latter. Then again, I'm an experienced desktop
user. If you're new to Linux, you may find the graphically
configurable Window Maker a little easier to learn. Both provide
multiple desktops, themed interfaces and graphic-based desktop
management tools. It's mostly a matter of taste.</p><p>The last article in this series is supposed to be on
AfterStep, a window manager very similar to Window Maker and also
based on the GNUStep environment. However, I may go with blackbox
or sawmill instead. Both are very stable and provide some
minimalistic aspects I find interesting. AfterStep is very much
like Window Maker, and I'd prefer to talk about a window manager
with a different design intent. If you want to get a jump on me,
start out over at
<a href="http://themes.org" target="_self">http://themes.org/</a>. You can
find links to all these window managers there, as well as some very
useful information on configuring and using your favorite.</p><p><a href="3986s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
