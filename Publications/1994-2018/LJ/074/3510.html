object-oriented-based UNIX GUI development tool for Motif and Java,
released just over a year ago for use on Linux. Along with Code
Fusion from Cygnus, BXPro won <i  >Linux Journal</i>'s
&ldquo;Editors Choice&rdquo; Award for Best New Application: Software
Development in 1999.
</p><p>In addition to highly intuitive widget layout, BX allows the
developer to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Build components by grouping widgets together and
making them into primary classes, with their own methods and data
interfaces, without the need to compile them into separate shared
libraries for placement on the palette.</p></li><li><p>Implement well organized ways to apply styles for a
consistent look and feel. Many organizations such as government and
military subcontractors have their own strict standards for how a
GUI should look, declaring their own font, color and other
conventions for particular systems.</p></li><li><p>Transparently keep code intact while the GUI is
undergoing evolutionary changes. Callback code is not lost when
changes to the GUI are made.</p></li><li><p>Invoke and use standard development tools, such as
Code Fusion, Purify, CVS, SGI Developer Magic and others.</p></li><li><p>Add new components and widgets on the palette and
use them &ldquo;live&rdquo;.</p></li><li><p>Develop C, C++, ViewKit, UIL and Java applications,
using industry-standard Motif and Lesstif.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfcb580.0x10c4000"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div><p>Builder Xcessory is the finest X and Motif GUI development
tool available today for OOD/OOP developers working in C/C++ and
Java, with enterprise development tools in the works, including
other GUI APIs. For application frameworks, it allows the use of
ViewKit and a MotifApp-based C++ class system, in addition to
straight C for those maintaining legacy applications.</p><p>ViewKit is ideal for C++ and Motif work, but for the
platforms on which it is not currently available, the
MotifApp-based C++ framework provided runs like a charm when used
with either Motif or LessTif. I found this especially helpful while
porting Motif applications to the Rebel NetWinder, since its
ViewKit port is still in the works at the time of this writing. One
advantage to using the free Lesstif libraries, when Motif is
absent, is that source is compatible across all UNIX/Linux-based
X11 platforms.</p><p>Running various window managers does not affect the operation
of the builder, as it has the Motif libraries statically bound,
which also means it can be run without having Motif installed at
all.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfcb580.0x10c41b8"></a>License</h2></div></div><p>The Linux version of BX does not mess around with licensing
daemons, using an encrypted license string instead. As of this
writing, BX is available on Linux for $250 US for the personal-use
license.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfcb580.0x10c42c0"></a>On-line Documentation and Tutorials</h2></div></div><p>In addition to the comprehensive hard-copy manuals, all
documentation is installed locally in HTML format and is easily
invoked from the help menu. The manuals also have complete
tutorials, describing in detail the steps needed to make use of
each feature of BX. Tutorial data files and example code abound,
and updates are freely available via the ICS FTP and web
site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfcb580.0x10c43c8"></a>Distributed and Thin-Client Applications</h2></div></div><p>As with most other GUI builders, it takes very little effort
to implement what is referred to as the fa&ccedil;ade design
pattern.</p><p>Modeling a complex object in a class, providing simplified
access functions or methods to control it, and then using the GUI
interface to view it allows us to make use of the Model View
Controller (MVC) concept. This means we could, at any time, convert
our program to a CORBA-type distributed application. Simply by
substituting a method invocation on a CORBA-based object from
within our GUI's event response routine, referred to as callbacks
in X parlance, we now have a modernized distributed application.
Keeping our GUI only loosely coupled to the data means we have
little or nothing to update when changing how the back end of our
application is implemented.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfcb580.0x10c4528"></a>Designing with BX</h2></div></div><p>BX is a true WYSIWYG GUI builder. It will allow you to add
widgets and components to other widgets and components intuitively.
As you build up the GUI, the design tree reflects the widget
hierarchy. This is more intuitive than other systems, where a
widget is added onto the design tree and the widget placement
appears on the screen. It is much more natural to interact with the
widgets directly without this level of indirection. BX will also
interactively show what happens to the window contents as it is
being resized, making manipulation of Motif's more complex
container widgets a breeze to configure.</p><p>

builder</p></div></div>
</p><p>Each Motif widget has its own list of resources which can be
set using the resource editor. This allows for setting resources
not related to geometry, such as fonts, colors and various
callbacks.</p><p>There are a number of options for displaying which resources
are viewable. As can be done with all of the BX menu items, the
&ldquo;View&rdquo; menu shown in Figure 4 has been &ldquo;torn off&rdquo; and displayed
in its own window, making for a more efficient workspace. If the
user has selected the &ldquo;All resources&rdquo; option, there can be more
resources potentially available for viewing than what is easily
scanned through. BX provides a resource finder that allows the user
to enter a search string, and any resource containing it will be
scrolled to and highlighted, as shown in Figure 5.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfcb580.0x10bb9c0"></a>Styles Management</h2></div></div><p>The styles manager in BX allows us to apply pre-set values
easily to the resources of any number of widgets. Suppose, for
example, we wanted a pushbutton with a label indicating
&ldquo;Dismiss&rdquo;, a bold font, with a black foreground and a somewhat
olive-colored background; we could use the style editor as shown in
Figure 6. Saving this style to a DismissButtonStyle, our style
hierarchy tree would look like Figure 7. When we create a
pushbutton and apply the style, it would look like Figure 8.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3510f6.large.jpg"><img src="3510f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 6. Style Editor</p></div></div>

</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3510f8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>Figure 8. Push button in Defined
Style</p></div></div>
</p><p>In addition to being able to apply styles to multiple widgets
at once, styles can easily be made shareable so they are available
to other applications being developed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfcb580.0x10bc150"></a>Creating New Classes</h2></div></div><p>BX has two modes of looking at widget hierarchies: class and
instance. Class mode indicates what the predefined appearance and
behavior of a component will be, in effect defining new types.
Instance mode tailors them for a particular widget or component, so
we can tweak what makes them different from others of the same
type.</p><p>From the most general class, we can define more specific
sub-classes, each time progressively getting more refined or
changing and overriding things as we go along.</p><p>To save time redesigning our standard layout, we can join a
number of logically related widgets together into a single entity
by turning it into a class. This makes reuse a snap, since all
newly created classes get added to the palette.</p><p>To create a class containing one or more widgets, select the
highest-level widget to use, then select the &ldquo;Make Class&rdquo; menu
option. In the previous widget tree containing a form widget with a
few buttons and a scrolled list, I performed the &ldquo;Make Class&rdquo;
operation, and now have a new component called ListProcessor which
I can treat as a stand-alone component. It is much more than a
simple widget, because we avoid having to delve into the depths of
Xlib, Xt and Motif, remaining at a relatively high level without
ever giving up control of any of the underlying widgets.</p><p>In class mode, we can use the widget class tree to select
which resources to expose, giving us a simplified means to control
our newly created component without the clutter of having to view
every resource of every widget it contains. As a convenience, any
resources flagged as &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; have
<span   class="bold"><b>set</b></span> type methods defined, so we
don't have to worry about the exact Motif name for widget resources
and the functions to set them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfcb580.0x10bc410"></a>Figure 9. Making New Class</h2></div></div><p>New class methods (functions and procedures) and data can be
added easily when we select the class entity in the browser. Our
resource editor puts us into class edit mode automatically when we
click the &ldquo;New&rdquo; button to add data or methods. (See Figures 9 and
10.)</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3510f10.large.jpg"><img src="3510f10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 10. Adding New Class Methods</p></div></div>

<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3510f11.large.jpg"><img src="3510f11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 11. Resource Editor</p></div></div>
</p><p>Our resource editor now appears as shown in Figure 11, with
the new entry inserted. We can now select the &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; button, and
if needed, our source code will be generated before whatever source
editor is brought up. At this point, we can look at our code with
the cursor placed automatically on the line where our function
starts.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3510f12.large.jpg"><img src="3510f12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 12. User Code Block</p></div></div>
</p><p>One thing we notice from the snapshot in Figure 12 are the
&ldquo;user code block&rdquo; begin and end comments around the user code
blocks. Anything between these can be modified by the programmer.
BX reserves the right to make changes outside of these user code
blocks, but will otherwise not interfere. BX avoids clobbering
user-written code by scanning for and skipping over sections that
are reserved by the developer. At the beginning of a project, these
are empty lines bounded by the comment delimiters. Throughout the
BX-generated code, these comment blocks will be found before,
during and after any major code operation. This may seem
superfluous to the new GUI programmer used to having only callback
code stubs generated, but they can be a big help in tweaking final
production code for major systems.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfcb580.0x10bcbf8"></a>ViewKit and MotifApp</h2></div></div><p>Until recently, Douglas A. Young was a principal scientist at
Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI). He has written a number of books on
Motif development and is the most-quoted and read author on GUIs,
having specialized on Motif in particular. His
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Object-Oriented Programming with C++ and
OSF/Motif</em></span> remains a much-cherished classic. In it, he
develops the MotifApp GUI application frameworks, which have
matured into the ViewKit product, originally available from SGI but
now free on Linux, and commercially available for other UNIX
platforms.</p><p>To understand what is meant by the &ldquo;Doug Young method&rdquo;, we
need to look at the choices available to an application framework
developer wanting to create an OOP framework using a GUI API based
on a non-OOP language, such as Motif.</p><p>In some ways, Motif is an OO package. It uses inheritance to
create new widget classes based on old ones, passing data and
methods down from a super class to a newly derived subclass. Since
it is written in C, some marshaling code is needed to overcome
language features present in true OOP languages like C++. Gtk+ uses
many of the same concepts, since it too is written in C, so the
strategies here hold true for Gtk+ as well.</p><p>Doug Young's observations about using C++ and a C GUI can be
paraphrased with his three strategies as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Our first option is not to use the OOP features of
C++, simply using the compiler's stronger type checking. This, of
course, will disallow us the greater advantages of using C++ and
OOP.</p></li><li><p>Our second choice is to encapsulate each and every
widget into C++ wrapper classes. Although this may provide some
aesthetic appeal, it obfuscates the fact that adding extra
marshaling code to obtain derived Motif objects is not true OOP,
and can induce a performance hit compared to straight C. We cannot
simply create a subclass of a C++-wrapped widget and expect it to
work properly, since this would extend only the wrapper class and
not the widget itself. In order to have an entire OOP widget class
hierarchy, we need to have our widgets written in an OOP language
from the ground up, the way the Qt widget set does.</p></li><li><p>The third and most natural approach to using C++
with a C GUI API is to create high-level components composed of
(instead of derived from) collections of GUI widgets. All
programmers make use of this functional, instead of object,
approach at one level or another, as we have yet to see an entirely
OO CPU make it to widespread use. Even things such as the Java
machines on a chip are, at some microcode level,
non-object-oriented machines.</p></li></ul></div><p>The ViewKit application frameworks, the commercial descendent
of MotifApp, have been developed using this third approach.
</p><p>To make things more intuitive, ViewKit has a feature called
VkEZ, which is comprised of a header file and a library. Instead of
forcing a programmer to use a number of Motif functions directly,
VkEZ overloads many of the assignment operators, at the same time
adding some extra helper functions. Examples of this include the
ability to assign strings to text and label widgets directly and
easily using the &ldquo;=&rdquo; operator. Although this may help get an
initial version of a program up and running, it is usually the case
that the VkEZ functions are replaced with their counterparts in the
way of direct Motif function calls.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfcb580.0x10bd178"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>BX's maturity into a highly evolved, flexible tool has made
it the tool of choice for serious OOP-based GUI development work
for any Linux/UNIX-based platform. It is sure to remain in my
software toolbox for years to come.</p></div></div>
