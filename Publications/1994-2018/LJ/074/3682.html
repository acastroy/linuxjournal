    Find out what's happening when using IP Masquerade and diald
    to access the Internet remotely.

system with no dial tone, no ringing signal and no busy signal.
You'd just dial your number and wait until someone either answered
or did not. It might be a frustrating experience after a while.
This is similar to the experience of someone on a LAN using
<span   class="bold"><b>diald</b></span> on a remote computer without
any way to monitor the status of the remote link, and the problem I
set out to solve about a month ago.
</p><p>My home LAN includes my main Linux box and a number of other
computers running some combination of Linux and Windows 95. With
the main Linux box configured to use diald and IP masquerade, my
wife can use her Win95 computer to check her e-mail, surf the Web,
and do other Internet tasks without having to do anything with the
modem, dial strings or the Linux box. She simply starts Netscape,
goes to a site out on the Web, and waits. The Linux box dials the
ISP, authenticates automatically and establishes the connection in
about thirty seconds&mdash;unless the modem gets a busy signal.
Unfortunately, there wasn't any feedback mechanism to tell the
Win95 box about the state of the connection. This article describes
my solution to that problem.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3d580.0xc35710"></a>Using Linux to Connect a LAN to the
Internet</h2></div></div><p>A single Linux box, equipped with a modem and configured to
use IP masquerade and diald (which is short for &ldquo;dial on
demand&rdquo;), allows every computer on the LAN to &ldquo;think&rdquo; it's
directly attached to the Internet. An Internet request originating
on a node of the LAN gets sent to the Linux box. If diald
determines that the serial link to the Internet service provider
(ISP) is not currently active, it initiates the dial sequence
(hence &ldquo;dial on demand&rdquo;). When the connection is made, the Linux
box authenticates with the ISP's computer, and the link to the
Internet is established. IP masquerade allows that single
connection to be used by every computer on the LAN by examining
each packet destined for (or coming from) the outside world and
substituting addresses where appropriate. The ISP side of the
connection sees traffic only to (or from) the single IP address
with which it authenticated&mdash;addresses in reply packets are then
substituted back into place before the IP Masquerade box places the
packets on the LAN side. While very complex, this all works
remarkably well when properly configured.</p><p>When my wife checks her e-mail, however, she has no way of
knowing the current state of the link. Her computer attempts to
fetch the mail, sending a request to the Linux box running diald.
The Linux box initiates the dial and authentication with the ISP,
but this takes about 30 seconds, and the Windows 95 machine isn't
that patient. When I use her machine, I just use TELNET to get to
the Linux box and observe diald's progress by doing something like
<b  >tail&nbsp;-f&nbsp;/var/log/messages</b>, but this
requires access to the system logs and some knowledge of how to
interpret them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3d580.0xc358c8"></a>An Easier Way from the Bottom Up</h2></div></div><p>The primary goal of the system was to provide an easier way
to monitor the status of the remote link. Since I already had an
HTTP server, Apache, installed and running on my Linux box and all
of the computers in the house have some kind of web browser, it
seemed an HTTP-based solution would be simplest. It has the
advantage of requiring changes only to the Linux machine, making
deployment quite simple. Conceptually, what's needed is:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>a way to monitor the state of diald on the Linux
box</p></li><li><p>a means by which a cgi-script can get that
information and pass it to the client</p></li><li><p>some means of automatically updating the
information on the client side</p></li></ul></div><p>Starting from the bottom and working up, you'll need to get
<span   class="bold"><b>chat</b></span> working first. I use a chat
script, /etc/ppp/chat.mindspring (see Listing 1) to dial in to my
ISP, Mindspring. I found both the ISP HOWTO
(<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/ISP-Hookup-HOWTO.html" target="_self">metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/ISP-Hookup-HOWTO.html</a>)
and the diald mini-howto
(<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/linux/HOWTO/mini/Diald.html" target="_self">metalab.unc.edu/linux/HOWTO/mini/Diald.html</a>)
very helpful in getting chat and diald working well. The IP
Masquerade mini-howto
(<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/linux/HOWTO/mini/IP-Masquerade.html" target="_self">metalab.unc.edu/linux/HOWTO/mini/IP-Masquerade.html</a>)
was instrumental in helping me configure IP Masquerade. By reading
carefully, planning meticulously and working methodically, you
should be able to get your system working without too much
difficulty within a couple of hours.
</p><p><a href="3682l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>This chat script uses the <b  >SAY</b> option,
which allows the printing of strings from within chat to STDOUT.
However, STDOUT must be redirected to a file to be useful in this
application. This is done by using a Perl script to run chat (see
Listing 2).</p><p><a href="3682l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>This script is necessary, because we use the single diald
FIFO (first-in, first-out) to send back messages. As you can see
from the script, we use the &ldquo;message&rdquo; prefix to send messages to
the diald control FIFO. Additionally, the complex method by which
we call chat is required, because old versions of diald call the
connect script with STDERR directed to the output device. Normally
this works just fine, but we need to send the STDERR results to a
file and not to the modem. Versions of diald from 0.98 on will
direct STDERR output to monitors by default, making this process
much simpler. Fortunately, diald sets a number of environment
variables which are useful for this script, including
<b  >MODEM</b> and <b  >FIFO</b> which allow us
to write a fairly portable script.</p><p><a href="3682l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>In the diald control script (Listing 3), note the connect
line (line 3) which runs the
<span   class="bold"><b>runchat.pl</b></span> Perl script. It has a
single argument, which is the name of the chat options file used.
This is useful in the event that multiple diald d&aelig;mons are
running simultaneously. In my case, one diald establishes a
connection to my ISP. Another diald dials into my office LAN. The
only required difference between the two diald scripts is the
argument provided to the runchat script. Other differences in my
case are the pppd-options file specified in the last line, and the
<span   class="bold"><b>defaultroute</b></span> line (my office
connection uses a separate routing script).</p><p>The diald control script will need to be changed somewhat if
you're using a more recent version of diald. I'm still using diald
version 0.16.4 and the 2.0.36 kernel, but I plan to upgrade to the
latest diald, version 0.99.1, as soon as I move to the 2.2 kernel.
In addition to a number of bug fixes, the new version includes
features which would probably be useful for a script like this. You
can find out about the latest version of diald, now maintained by
Mike Jagdis, at
<a href="http://diald.unix.ch" target="_self">http://diald.unix.ch/</a>.</p><p>A few more pieces are required to make all of this work. One
is the script that establishes a connection to diald and listens
via monitor FIFO to whatever diald and chat have to say. This
script is reproduced in Listing 4 and is a Perl implementation of a
poor man's d&aelig;mon.</p><p><a href="3682l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>This simple script maintains a file (/tmp/diald.status) which
contains the last few relevant entries. Following the lead of the
Tk <span   class="bold"><b>dctrl</b></span> program, the file is
cleared whenever the <b  >CONNECT</b> string is received.
This is a useful way to slice things, since the user is likely
interested in only the current connection progress and not in
historical data. The <b  >CONNECT</b> message is the
first one transmitted via FIFO when the need for a new connection
is determined by diald. Note also that the messages are detected
and passed unparsed to the output file.</p><p>Finally, the end user has to actually see the results of all
this work. This is done by having a special web page on the Linux
box, which causes the client browser to spawn a separate status
window, allowing the user to monitor the state of the Internet
connection while browsing or downloading e-mail. The browser's home
page is set to an appropriate local page (i.e., a page served by
the Linux server) containing the following JavaScript tag:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript"&gt;
&lt;!-- comment hides the script from old browsers
newWindow = window.open (
 'http://clyde/cgi-bin/dialdstate.pl?', 'dialdstate',&lt;\n&gt;
 'scrollbars=no,status=no,width=365,height=285, status,
marginheight=2, marginwidth=2');
// end of hidden portion. --&gt;
&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
</pre><p>The height and width were chosen empirically, and &ldquo;clyde&rdquo;
is the name of the server box as presented to the LAN. All that
remains is the content of the
<span   class="bold"><b>dialdstate.pl</b></span> program, which is in
Listing 5.
</p><p><a href="3682l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p><p>This script does very little except set up a simple page with
JavaScript. The only reason it is not just an ordinary HTML page is
that we use an automatic reload to cause the browser to refresh the
page automatically every 7 seconds. This is the
<b  >setTimeout("location.reload() ",&nbsp;7000);</b>
line, which executes the
<span   class="bold"><b>location.reload</b></span> command every 7000
milliseconds. This causes the Perl script on the server to rerun
and provide the latest data to the user. This is fine on my home
LAN with few users and little traffic, but you should carefully
consider the load implications before deploying this on a larger
LAN.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3d580.0xc368f0"></a>Future Enhancements</h2></div></div><p>This solution meets the goal of providing link status
information to the user, with minimal effort required by the user
and no custom software on the client side. As with any project,
though, there is room for continued improvement.</p><p>Possible future enhancements include upgrading to the latest
version of diald and exploiting more of its features, such as
reporting on the state of multiple connections. Another improvement
might be to rewrite the &ldquo;d&aelig;mon&rdquo; in C++ rather than Perl.
The existing version works, but it's not particularly
elegant.</p><p>Also possible is the addition of remote link control via
JavaScript buttons (e.g., Up, Down, Block, etc.), but this should
be done carefully to avoid opening a security hole. Allowing
external sites to see the status of the LAN's dialup link wouldn't
necessarily be a security problem, but allowing external sites to
control it would be. On my Linux box, I have IP masquerade set up
such that the HTTP server is visible only from within the LAN. An
alternative approach might be to use the security methods in Apache
to limit access to sensitive web pages.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xb3d580.0xc36aa8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>IP masquerade and diald are useful tools for allowing
Internet access to an entire LAN, although sometimes it's nice to
know what's going on remotely. By using the scripts presented here,
even novice users on your LAN can enjoy some of the power of Linux
without even knowing it's there.</p></div></div>
