    Log system activities over a TCP network securely by
    interfacing the existing syslog d&amp;aelig;mon with secure shell using
    simple Perl scripts.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x1005710"></a></h2></div></div><p>Undoubtedly, one of the most important
tasks for keeping a networked system safe is monitoring its
activity. Most system programs today communicate with
<span   class="bold"><b>syslogd</b></span> noting important events
(such as an <span   class="bold"><b>su</b></span> request). Also, the
kernel can note hardware failures and other things on that level.
Of course, when monitoring for possible break-ins or trying to
track down the path an intruder used to violate a system, the logs
can be a precious resource. However, it is evident that an intruder
could manipulate system logs if he were able to get the necessary
permissions, thus completely fooling any attempt to track down the
intrusion, even to the extreme point of making it hard to spot.
</p><p>A first step toward solving the problem of keeping the system
logs on the system itself was made many years ago when the ability
to send logging messages over the network to another host was added
to syslogd. Sending the needed log parts to another host, which is
quite secure (a dedicated machine, for example), was actually a
half-solution to the problem. Using a trivial protocol like UDP to
transmit data over networks made it very easy to spoof, making it
possible for the intruder to add malicious messages or even try to
create a denial-of-service attack. Again, all data is sent through
the network in clear form, making it simple to sniff, so an
intruder could get more details about the system before attempting
a break-in.</p><p>A solution we developed to solve this problem is having the
standard syslogd facility use the secure shell
(<span   class="bold"><b>ssh</b></span>) package to forward the logs,
using authentication and encryption, to another computer. This way,
the system we want to keep logged won't require special changes,
and the system that will maintain the logs will not require another
running syslogd. It will require
<span   class="bold"><b>sshd</b></span> (secure shell d&aelig;mon)
running with some normal system tools on a normal user
account.</p><p>We will present two technically similar but conceptually
different methods, with some pros and cons, of performing this
important task. The first could be compared to a &ldquo;push&rdquo;
technology; that is, the machine that wants to log its data on an
outside machine will actually force data to go on the other side.
The second method will use a &ldquo;pull&rdquo; technology, since the remote
client will try to retrieve the logs from the desired
machine.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x1005a80"></a>Requirements</h2></div></div><p>Since our solutions use the standard syslog facilities to
grab messages, you need a syslog d&aelig;mon that supports logging
output to named pipes. Most recent syslog d&aelig;mons have this
(check the man page for support, or try it directly). It is very
important that you have a syslogd that opens pipes in non-blocking
mode.</p><p>Older syslogs used to open the pipes in blocking mode, so if
the named pipe was full (in our context, for example, if the
connection had been broken for some time), then the whole syslog
process stopped while waiting for the pipe to have some space
available. This, of course, could have dramatic consequences, since
all the logging, not just the remote one, would have been
compromised. As a practical test to see whether your syslogd is
handling pipes correctly, configure the whole system, then try
writing in the pipe until it reaches the maximum dimension, usually
4KB. When the connection is down, check whether syslog is still
logging something or if it seems to be frozen. Anyway, we suggest
getting the latest version you can find (which should correct other
bugs as well) and installing it on your system (at the moment, the
latest version is 1.3-31). The more advanced syslog-ng package
should work as well with our solution. Apart from this, you will
need a Perl interpreter, the <span   class="bold"><b>tail</b></span>
command from the textutils package, and of course, the secure shell
package.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x1005c38"></a>The First Solution</h2></div></div><p>The theory behind this &ldquo;push&rdquo; solution is quite
straightforward. A Perl script will run in the background, and will
connect (using ssh) to the host where we wish to keep the copy of
the logs. The Perl script will then monitor a named pipe we will
create, and send anything it will get from the pipe over the secure
connection to the other side, where we will put everything in a
file. Instructing syslog to send the desired logging events to our
named pipe will make the work complete.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x1005d40"></a>The Glue: the First Perl Script</h2></div></div><p>Let's give a brief technical description of the source code
(see Listing1). Once started, the script will open a local log
(defined in <b  >$local_log</b>) to report failures (this
can be disabled by undefining the variable), then it will try to
connect to the remote host (defined in <b  >$host</b>).
The connection subroutine opens the ssh command to the remote side,
specifying the user name to be used, whether to use compression and
to establish a quiet connection. As you can see, ssh will ask the
remote end to execute a <span   class="bold"><b>cat</b></span> of a
given file, so everything will be stored there for further use.
Once connected, the script will open the local named pipe we
created, then forward everything to the other side, where the cat
command will store it. Of course, if the secure connection should
die for some reason (technically, if the print on the file handle
should fail), the script will try to establish the connection
again.</p><p>As a last feature, the script will send a timestamp each
defined time interval to the other end, which could be useful for
tracking down when the last message actually came from the host if
something serious has happened. In fact, the script can detect that
the connection went down each time it sends something over the
network. By sending a timestamp to the FIFO (i.e.,
first-in/first-out pipe), it will automatically trigger the check
that the connection is alive at that moment.</p><p><a href="3913l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x1006058"></a>Configuring ssh on Server and Client
Side</h2></div></div><p>Even if this should look like the easier step to accomplish,
there are a few things you must pay attention to, so that an
intruder, who has discovered the remote logging facility, won't be
able to use it as a way to break in to the logger machine. First of
all, you must generate your key pair on the network machine from
which you're sending the logs by using the
<span   class="bold"><b>ssh-keygen</b></span> utility. You do not
have to set a password (just press return twice at the prompt) to
this pair of keys (that should be used just for the logging
program), so the script will not have to prompt you for it each
time it starts.</p><p>With <span   class="bold"><b>ssh2</b></span>, you'll have to
specify that you're going to use this newly created private key as
a possible key to identify yourself. Add it to your
~/.ssh2/identification file by adding a new line with the
<b  >IdKey</b> statement, followed by the key name.
(Alternatively, you could force this on the command line to ssh in
the script.) Now, you'll have to transfer the public key to the
system where you're going to store the logs, and add it to that
user's authorized key file. (Usually ~/.ssh/authorized_keys in
ssh1, where each line contains a key. In ssh2, copy the key to your
~/.ssh2 directory, then add an entry to your authorization file,
~/.ssh2/authorization by default, in the usual syntax
<b  >Key&nbsp;key_<i><tt>filename</tt></i></b>.)
This instructs sshd on that machine to authenticate anyone using
the private key that couples with that public key without further
checks.</p><p>Depending on the ssh configuration, you should normally have
to log only once using this new generated key. At the first
connection, ssh will have to add the key of the new host to your
known_hosts files (by default, not an automatic task); it will
prompt you to confirm that you would like to add the key. Pay
attention to the authorization and key files permissions: they must
be readable and writable only to the user&mdash;for security reasons
first of all, but also because ssh will refuse to accept
connections with such badly configured keys. Try logging in verbose
mode if any problem occurs, since this will tell you exactly why
the connection was not permitted.</p><p>A complete login over ssh could be done this way with that
key. This would be very dangerous, so finally you must put some
important restrictions on the use of the key. First, specify from
which hosts this key could be used with the
<b  >from=</b> directive, so if someone were to steal the
private key, he couldn't log on from any place other than the ones
you specify. Second, inhibit the allocation of a
<b  >pty</b> with <b  >no-pty</b>. Finally,
limit the use of this key to just appending something to the
logging file; that is, the command the Perl scripts execute on the
remote machine. This is done using the <b  >command=</b>
directive and should be:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
command="cat &gt;&gt;
</pre><p>At this point, you can be quite sure that nothing more than
appending to the log file can be done, and you can use your normal
account on some machine as a log storer, since this won't open you
to any danger (other than having your space filled with logs), if
the log key is correctly restricted by ssh. In ssh2, you'll have to
add just the command restriction option, using the Command
directive in your authorization file. Check out the man page for
exact information on the syntax.
</p><p>Since many sshd installations check the TCP wrappers files
before allowing a connection, make sure the hosts from which you
wish to connect are allowed to do so. As a user, be sure you don't
have any .shosts or .rhosts files from the machine you are logging.
If present, everything would seem to work (since authorizations
would be done through these, if allowed by the d&aelig;mon), but
the system would be very insecure.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x1006688"></a>Configuring syslogd</h2></div></div><p>The first thing we have to do is create the named pipe needed
for the communication between the syslogd and our script. This is
easy; use the <span   class="bold"><b>mkfifo</b></span> command with
the full path name of the named pipe as the parameter to create it.
Now you must tell syslogd the kind of messages it should send to
that pipe, using the standard syslogd syntax:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
log_facility:    | /
</pre><p>It would be a good idea to send over the network the usual
authorization tasks (auth.* and authpriv.*), critical messages
(*.crit and *.emerg) and important kernel network-related messages
(especially if you're filtering packets or something like that). It
is very important to choose all the needed facilities to have a
good overview of the system status. This changes, of course, from
system to system (the facilities used could also be compilation,
and thus distribution-dependent), so be sure to test it thoroughly.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x1006898"></a>Make It Run</h2></div></div><p>Once all the steps are done, you must start the script,
redirecting the standard error and output to /dev/null so ssh
errors won't be displayed. Then, once it runs, restart syslogd so
it will reread its configuration. If everything has been done
correctly, you should now have your logs on the remote machine, and
you should put the script in your startup file so it will be
started at boot time. The program can run using normal user
privileges; it doesn't need any special permission. Just make sure
it can read from and write to the named pipe created for the
communication with syslogd, and eventually, to the file selected
for local error logging.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x10069a0"></a>The Second Solution</h2></div></div><p>The second method is based on retrieving the data, a
&ldquo;pull&rdquo;, instead of receiving it from the syslog. In this
solution, a Perl script will run on the machine where we are going
to store an additional copy of the logs, which will connect to the
machine we want to monitor and obtain the logs from it. This task
will be done just by using the
<span   class="bold"><b>tail</b></span> command on the log file, so
everything that comes to it will also be displayed on our
side.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x1006b00"></a>The Glue: the Second Perl Script</h2></div></div><p>This script is quite similar to the first one, as you can see
(in Listing 2). It has the usual procedure to connect to the remote
host using ssh, the variables that hold the configuration and some
local logging capabilities. Since the script is running on the
machine that holds the additional copy of the logs, the logs for
the script will also be stored on this machine. Once the connection
is open, the script will continue reading from the ssh file handle
and print everything on standard output, which will very likely be
redirected to a file on startup. As we invoked it, ssh will execute
tail on the log file, so each time something is added to the log
file, it will be sent over. If an error occurs, then the script
will try to reset the connection and log the error.</p><p><a href="3913l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x1006cb8"></a>Configuring ssh on Server and Client
Side</h2></div></div><p>The configuration of ssh is very similar to the previous, but
of course the roles are exchanged. In fact, here we will have to
connect from the additional logging machine to the machine we want
to log, so you will have to create the key on the additional
machine and copy the public key to the authorized keys on the other
machine. All other restrictions and hints should be used in the
same way as before. Remember, you must now set the command to
execute to the new one; that is, the tail defined in the Perl
script by the <b  >$cmd</b> variable.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x13ff068"></a>Configuration of syslogd</h2></div></div><p>In this example, you shouldn't have to change anything in the
syslog, since you will be using tail on the already-existing log
file. Anyway, we strongly suggest creating a new log file (using
the usual syntax) including the most important things that need to
be stored on the other machine. Another small problem arises from
the fact that this consumes disk space. This is quite easily
solved, since you can add a job to your crontab that deletes the
file from time to time. Remember that syslog must be restarted if
the log file has been deleted and recreated using
<span   class="bold"><b>touch</b></span>, since it must exist for
syslog to use it. If you have a recent version of textutils, then
tail (with the  <b  >--retry</b> option) won't care
about the file being deleted (use the
<span   class="bold"><b>rm</b></span> command) and will create and
open a new file. If you have an older version that doesn't support
this option, you could just <span   class="bold"><b>kill</b></span>
the tail command (this is easily done with some piping from
<span   class="bold"><b>ps</b></span> to
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> to kill) in the same cron as
before, and the Perl script will then restart it from the remote
side. Of course, we strongly suggest upgrading the textutils if
possible.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x13ff380"></a>Make It Run</h2></div></div><p>Once configured, you should just start the script,
redirecting the standard output (and error, too, but this isn't
necessary) to the file that will keep your logs. The script on the
logging machine doesn't need any special privileges. Of course, the
file with the logs must always be readable by the user who is
effectively running the tail command executed via ssh in the remote
script. This means that if you're going to delete the file, you
must set the correct ownership and modes each time in the cron
job.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x13ff488"></a>Comparison of the Two Methods</h2></div></div><p>Both ways are effective for remote logging, and they are
almost equivalent. We wanted to describe both, since one could be
easier to use in some environments. For example, if you don't have
sshd running on the machine where you want to store the logs, you
could just install the ssh client in your home and use the second
solution. Also, we wished to point out some interesting problems
that can arise in communicating over a network.</p><p>The first method uses a somewhat &ldquo;real time&rdquo; logging. Each
time a message is generated by syslog, it is sent through the pipe
to the other side if possible. So, once something is generated by
syslog, it is sent (in normal circumstances, of course) and can't
be stopped in any way. This is a great feature for such a system,
but causes a general process communication problem: buffering.
Since the pipe that serves as a communication link between syslogd
and the program was opened in non-blocking mode and has a finite
buffer size, if syslog generates data too fast, then the data will
be lost. If it could open it in blocking mode, we could solve this
problem, but then if the pipe couldn't get free space in a short
time, the process would just freeze and lose other data. This is an
interesting problem of real-time communication. Practically, it
shouldn't be a problem, since if you intelligently select which
syslog facilities to send over the network and a decent connection
exists between the two machines, then the buffer shouldn't get
filled so quickly.</p><p>As a way of solving this possible data loss, the second
program will read the logs from a disk file, jumping over the
buffering problem (the disk file is the growing buffer, so it
doesn't have such restricted limitations). Of course, this isn't a
&ldquo;real-time&rdquo; solution, since tail has to check whether the file
changes in given time periods, otherwise it would constantly be
using the CPU to check for changes; see the
<b  >--sleep</b> interval in the info file. So
theoretically in this short time period, a malicious cracker should
find your program running and kill it (again, very
improbable).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xf0d580.0x13ff698"></a>Security Implications</h2></div></div><p>As to the security of the account used for the secure shell,
the two methods are both secure if the restrictions are set
correctly as explained. There shouldn't be a direct way to break
from one machine to the other by using the restricted logging
access, since nothing but the designed command can be used. Of
course, you should have noticed that once a break-in is made on the
machine we are logging, the cracker can initiate a
denial-of-service attack by trying to fill the disk space on the
remote machine. This is an old problem with logging and can be
dealt with simply by placing the logs on a non-vital (that is, a
non-root) partition or by using quotas if possible. Since the
script doesn't need any other special permission to be executed, it
is also evident that there aren't any root-privilege process
problems.</p></div></div>
