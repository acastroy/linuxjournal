    Building a web-based telephone book can be easy, as long as
    you don't drink too much of Marcel's wine while you work.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce3580.0xddb608"></a></h2></div></div><p>Bon soir, mes amis. It is so very good to
see you again. What? No, Fran&ccedil;ois, I do not think this is a
good time. We have guests. Take a message and I will call later.
Forgive me, mes amis. Fran&ccedil;ois has been run off his feet
since we started distributing our new on-line phone book. My
impetuous waiter put our name as a default record in each of the
databases, and now everyone is calling! Mon Dieu!
</p><p>The phone book? But, of course. In fact, in honor of this
month's issue celebrating &ldquo;The People Behind Linux&rdquo;, we are
cooking up a web-based telephone book made with rich, yet
low-calorie, open-source software and our secret ingredient, Linux.
I think you will find the recipe quite enjoyable and practical too,
non? What is the point of knowing all these people if you never
talk to them? That is why Fran&ccedil;ois' mother insisted that her
name be put in. I jest. Please sit, mes amis, while I show you how
to create your own web-based telephone book, which is sure to
become a centerpiece of your intranet. For added spice, this wonder
of the intranet even provides an IN/OUT board.</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois! Bring some wine for our guests. Vite!</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4022f1.large.jpg"><img src="4022f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. The web phonebook's search
screen</p></div></div>
</p><p>Before we get into the <span   class="emphasis"><em>meat</em></span> of this
recipe, may I suggest that you look at Figure 1 which shows the
administration search screen. The standard user's screen is
similar, but does not have the option to
<span   class="bold"><b>add</b></span> a user. Figure 2 shows the
results of a fairly wide search. Note the gray and red buttons that
allow you to modify or delete an entry.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4022f2.large.jpg"><img src="4022f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Administration Search Results
Screen</p></div></div>
</p><p>Our telephone book is written entirely in Perl and uses
PostgreSQL to store its entries. Before I get too far, I will tell
you what you will need,</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>PostgreSQL</p></li><li><p>DBD and DBI modules for PostgreSQL from CPAN</p></li><li><p>The cgi-lib.pl Perl library</p></li></ul></div><p>In all likelihood, Perl is already loaded on your system.
Most distributions include it as part of the standard install. You
should also have the Apache web server running. Again, it is
extremely likely that you installed Apache with your system.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce3580.0xddc000"></a>Preparation</h2></div></div><p>PostgreSQL can be found at the official PostgreSQL site and,
in most cases, on your Linux distribution CD. For my Red Hat
system, it was simply a matter of installing PostgreSQL with the
<span   class="bold"><b>rpm</b></span> command.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -ivh postgresql-6.5.2-1.i386.rpm
rpm -ivh postgresql-devel-6.5.2-1.i386.rpm
rpm -ivh postgresql-server.6.5.2-1.i386.rpm
</pre><p>Depending on when you obtain and load PostgreSQL, the numbers
may vary. Part of what happens during this installation is to
create a <span   class="bold"><b>postgres</b></span> user. After
assigning a password to this user, log in as postgres and
initialize the database environment. Remember that the paths may
vary depending on your installation.
<pre     class="programlisting">
initdb --pglib=/usr/lib/pgsql --pgdata=/var/lib/pgsql
</pre>


Next, you will need to create some default PostgreSQL users. If you
are installing as root (for access to Perl directories, cgi
directories, etc.), then root will have to be added. So will the
user &ldquo;nobody&rdquo;. This is often the user of your httpd server. Some
have a user called &ldquo;www&rdquo; to run web services. I will use
&ldquo;nobody&rdquo; as mine, and you may use whatever your server is
configured for. Start by logging in as your postgres user, and
execute the following command to add the users root and nobody to
your PostgreSQL system:
<pre     class="programlisting">
createuser root
</pre>


You'll be prompted for root's UID (accept the default) and whether
user root is allowed to create databases. Answer &ldquo;y&rdquo;. When asked
whether root is allowed to create users, I answered &ldquo;n&rdquo;. Now, do
the same thing for user nobody. The only difference is that I
answer &ldquo;n&rdquo; to the question of whether nobody is allowed to create
databases as well. Depending on which version of PostgreSQL you are
using, the question of whether a user is allowed to create other
users may be worded this way:
<pre     class="programlisting">
Is user "whoever" a superuser?
</pre>


The answer is still n, or &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Finally, with the creation of
nobody, you will then be asked whether
<span   class="bold"><b>createuser</b></span> should create a
database for nobody. Answer &ldquo;y&rdquo; and you are finished creating
users.
</p><p>Both the <span   class="bold"><b>DBD</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>DBI</b></span> module can be found at the
CPAN FTP site, a huge Perl resource on the web. Since the two
modules are in slightly different directories, I will give you
both:
<a href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/DBI" target="_self">ftp://ftp.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/DBI/</a>
and
<a href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/DBD" target="_self">ftp://ftp.cpan.org/CPAN/modules/by-module/DBD/</a>.</p><p>At the time of this writing, the latest and greatest DBI
version was DBI-1.13.tar.gz, whereas DBD weighed in at a
comfortable DPD-Pg-0.93.tar.gz.</p><p>The DBI module is common to all the various databases, but
the DBD module must be specific. DBD modules are available for
numerous databases such as Oracle, Informix and, of course,
PostgreSQL. DBI is an application program interface (API) for Perl5
to interface with database systems. The idea is to provide a
consistent set of modules and calls so that database access code is
portable without too much fuss. Since each database will vary
somewhat, however, the DBD module comes into play to take those
differences into consideration.</p><p>For more information on how DBI works, try this address:
<a href="http://www.isc.org/services/public/lists/dbi-lists.html" target="_self">www.isc.org/services/public/lists/dbi-lists.html</a>.
You do not need the information in order to be able to cook up
today's recipe, but it makes for interesting reading later.</p><p>Install the DBI module first by unpacking the distributions
into some temporary directory and following these steps:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/temp_dir
tar -xzvf DBI-1.13.tar.gz
cd DBI-1.13
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
</pre><p>Tres simple. To install the DBD module, the process is
similar. The latest version of the DBD module now requires you to
set a couple of environment variables before the install can occur.
These are <b  >POSTGRES_LIB</b> and
<b  >POSTGRES_INCLUDE</b>.
<pre     class="programlisting">
POSTGRES_LIB=/usr/lib/pgsql
export POSTGRES_LIB
POSTGRES_INCLUDE=/usr/include/pgsql
export POSTGRES_INCLUDE
</pre>


Now, you can run the install:
<pre     class="programlisting">
cd /usr/local/temp_dir
tar -xzvf DBD-Pg-0.93.tar.gz
cd DBD-Pg-0.93
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
</pre>


The final ingredient you will need is the cgi-lib.pl library for
Perl. This has become a virtual (de facto) standard for CGI design
using forms. Surf over to the following address and save the file
into your /usr/lib/perl5 directory:
<a href="http://cgi-lib.berkeley.edu" target="_self">http://cgi-lib.berkeley.edu/</a>.
</p><p>If your Perl libraries live in a different directory (e.g.,
/usr/local/lib/perl5), you will need to modify the
<b  >require&nbsp;/usr/lib/perl5/cgi-lib.pl</b> line near
the top of each cgi-bin perl script to reflect your own directory
structure.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce3580.0xddca50"></a>Cooking Instructions (Installation)</h2></div></div><p>After all these steps are completed, we have pretty much all
the pieces we need to continue with the actual phone book creation
and build. If you haven't already done so, obtain the distribution
for the phone book from the Salmar web site in the downloads
section or from the <i  >Linux Journal</i> FTP web site
(see Resources).</p><p>The tar, gzipped distribution file is designed to extract
into the standard Red Hat file structure for the Apache server,
namely /home/httpd/html and /home/http/cgi-bin.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /home/httpd
tar -xzvf /path_to/phonebook.tar.gz
</pre><p>The file list looks something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
html/sciphb/
html/sciphb/index.html
html/sciphb/admin/
html/sciphb/admin/index.html
cgi-bin/sciphb/
cgi-bin/sciphb/admin/
cgi-bin/sciphb/admin/getphoneinfo.pl
cgi-bin/sciphb/admin/updphone.pl
cgi-bin/sciphb/admin/getphone.pl
cgi-bin/sciphb/admin/createphdbs.pl
cgi-bin/sciphb/ugetphone.pl
cgi-bin/sciphb/getnextkey.pl
</pre>


If you are running Apache from binaries built from the default
source distribution, those directories will likely be
/usr/local/apache/htdocs and /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin. If this is
the case, you can extract the files to a temporary directory and
move the sciphb directories to the appropriate cgi-bin and
html/htdocs. Since there is always more than one way to do it, you
could create symbolic links like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir /home/httpd
ln -s /usr/local/apache/htdocs /home/httpd/html
ln -s /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin /home/httpd/cgi-bin
</pre>


Everything will work fine from here, but you may want to verify the
path to Perl. The .pl files in the cgi-bin/sciphb directory all
call Perl from /usr/bin/perl. If necessary, change the first line
of these files to reflect the actual path to your Perl binary.
</p><p>Let this simmer for a few seconds, then change directory to
the admin cgi scripts location:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd /home/httpd/cgi-bin/sciphb/admin
</pre><p>There you will find a file called
<span   class="bold"><b>createphdbs.pl</b></span> which (strangely
enough) will create the databases necessary to use the phone book.
This package is quite simple and, I believe, will provide the
aspiring chef plenty of inspiration for further development. The
scripts are small in number, but going through each script would
take far too much space and take great advantage of the hospitality
of this fine publication. I would, however, like to show you the
PostgreSQL table creation for this on-line directory. Keep in mind
that this is just a code morsel (Listing 1) and not the finished
product. The first section shows the setup and initial calls using
the Perl DBI in order to create the phone database. In particular,
pay close attention to the line that begins with
<pre     class="programlisting">
$dbh = DBI-&gt;connect("dbi:Pg:dbname=$dbmain",
</pre>


The dbi:Pg identifies the database interface type (DBD); in this
case, <b  >Pg</b> stands for PostgreSQL.
</p><p><a href="4022l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Listing 2 is a portion of the actual database creation. Note
the <b  >$dbh</b> calls throughout. These are what make
the DBI environment portable. Once having established the DBD (as
in the connect statement above), there should be very little need
to modify this code if you were to use another database.</p><p><a href="4022l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>Of course, there is more, but you will have to download the
scripts to satisfy your appetite.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xce3580.0x11d5430"></a>Serving Suggestions: Your Completed Phone
Book</h2></div></div><p>The phone book has two different interfaces: one for lookups
only and another for both lookups and updates. You can, if you
wish, use only the administration page if you are content to allow
anyone in your organization to update the phone book information.
Modifications of the index.html file to pull in the administration
page require only a change to the actual page being pulled in. To
access the default user interface, use this link:
<tt  >http://<i><tt>your_server</tt></i>/sciphb/</tt>.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4022f3.large.jpg"><img src="4022f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 3. Adding Users Through the Phonebook's
Administration</p></div></div>
</p><p>The administration version of this page (which allows the
adding of users, modification of records and deletes) can be
accessed by going to this address:
<tt  >http://<i><tt>your_server</tt></i>/sciphb/admin/</tt>.</p><p>I recommend you keep the user and administration portions
separate. Give a few specific users the responsibility of updating
the phone book, and the information should continue to make
sense.</p><p>You might also consider changing the available fields. For
instance, the IN/OUT board aspect of the directory may not be for
you. Perhaps you need another field. With the scripts provided and
a little time, modifying this telephone directory to suit specific
needs should be quite simple.</p><p>Once again, mes amis, it is closing time. The pleasure of
having you here on a regular basis puts, how shall I say,
&ldquo;pressure&rdquo; on my wine cellar. Ho, ho! I shall have to replenish,
non? It is okay, mes amis. Chef Marcel is only kidding. There is
always more wine, but the doors, they must close sometime. Until
next time, enjoy that on-line telephone book. Remember&mdash;you are
always welcome here at Chez Marcel. Bon App&eacute;tit!</p></div></div>
