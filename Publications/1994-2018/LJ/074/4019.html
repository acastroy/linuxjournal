    The new Intel chip promises to take the PC to the high-end
    server market. Will Linux go along?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e8580.0x1ae05b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>After more than six years of effort,
Intel is finally ready to deploy its first processor based on the
IA-64 instruction set, which it co-developed with Hewlett-Packard.
The chip, named Itanium, is designed to go where no Pentium has
gone before: the high end of the server market. When it arrives,
Itanium will open doors not just for Intel but also for Linux.
Today, a few large companies ship the vast majority of big servers.
Sun, HP, IBM and Compaq servers rely mainly on proprietary RISC
processors and proprietary versions of UNIX. But with the
turbo-charged Itanium, many other vendors will deliver servers that
match the power of these proprietary machines. These vendors are
likely to rely on Linux or one of two key competitors: Monterey
UNIX or Windows 2000.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e8580.0x1ae06b8"></a>Itanium Designed for Servers</h2></div></div><p>Intel is no stranger to the server market. Its chips have
been used in PC servers for years, and in 1998, the company
introduced the Xeon product line specifically for bigger systems.
But there is little to distinguish the latest Xeon products from
the Pentium III chips in PCs: they use the same CPU, have the same
bus bandwidth and remain limited to 32-bit virtual addressing.
Itanium is Intel's first CPU designed from the ground up for server
applications. For starters, the chip offers 64-bit addressing,
providing programmers with much more flexibility when dealing with
large objects and data sets. RISC processors have included 64-bit
addressing for nearly a decade.</p><p>Instead of simply extending the aging x86 instruction set to
64 bits, Intel decided to leap to a new instruction set, IA-64.
This state-of-the-art design includes a host of
performance-enhancing features&mdash;such as predication, speculation
and register frames&mdash;that are not found in x86 or RISC
processors.</p><p>The general intent of these features is to give the compiler
more control over the hardware. In theory, the compiler can make
better decisions about how to group and order instructions for
optimal performance. Furthermore, the processor hardware is
simplified by relying on the compiler to make these decisions.
Simpler processors can be both faster and less expensive to
manufacture. Many previous instruction sets have failed to gain
significant market share. The problem has been incompatibility with
existing software. Itanium solves this problem by including an x86
translation unit on the chip. This unit can process any existing
x86 application, albeit at a lower speed than an application that
has been recompiled for IA-64.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e8580.0x1ae0870"></a>Itanium Systems Nearly Ready</h2></div></div><p>Intel has already produced hundreds of Itanium prototypes
that are being used to validate new IA-64 hardware and software.
Although there may be a few glitches remaining, the project appears
on track. More than two dozen vendors plan to deploy Itanium
systems, with the first systems appearing this fall.</p><p>In fact, nearly every major server vendor except Sun
Microsystems has endorsed IA-64. Over time, HP will convert its
entire line of RISC systems to the new architecture, as will SGI.
IBM and Compaq will continue to develop RISC processors and
systems, but will also deploy a broad range of IA-64 products.
Companies such as Acer, Dell and Gateway will add Itanium to their
Xeon server lines. With all of this backing, IA-64 is likely to
grab at least 60% of the server market by 2003, according to a new
report &ldquo;Intel's Itanium and IA-64&rdquo; from MicroDesign Resources.
This would represent a big change from today's market, which is
split among a variety of platforms. Linux holds 25% of the server
market, according to IDC, a number that is rising rapidly. Although
Linux is offered on several RISC platforms, the makers of these
systems prefer to sell their own proprietary UNIX versions. Linux
has been most popular on x86 systems from PC server makers. These
vendors are most likely to benefit from Itanium. Current Intel
processors can't match the performance and bandwidth of the best
RISC systems, limiting PC server makers to low-end and mid-range
systems. Using Itanium and Intel's new Lion motherboard, PC server
makers will push into high-end markets, taking Linux with
them.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x19e8580.0x1ae09d0"></a>Linux Competitors Join Forces</h2></div></div><p>Linux faces strong competitors in the Itanium market. IBM and
SCO are merging their versions of UNIX, AIX and UnixWare into an
IA-64 operating system known as Monterey. Based on the AIX kernel,
Monterey offers reliability and scalability features from IBM's
high-end servers. Because of the popularity of UnixWare, Monterey
is a natural choice for Itanium systems from Compaq, Dell and, of
course, IBM. Microsoft hopes to dominate the IA-64 market with a
64-bit version of its Windows 2000 operating system. Most PC server
vendors will offer this as the default choice for Itanium systems.
Previous Microsoft server products lack robustness and do not scale
well beyond four processors; the company is working to fix these
problems, but how long this will take remains to be seen. For small
and mid-range servers, however, Windows will no doubt be a popular
choice.</p><p>Linux's open-source model provides an advantage over these
competitors, and it continues to gain features that will help it
better compete against the likes of Monterey. As IA-64 processors
displace proprietary RISCs from the high-end market, they create
opportunities for newer operating systems. This platform change
should boost Linux's prospects.</p></div></div>
