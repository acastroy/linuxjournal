been continuously evolving since the early days of the personal
computer industry. Visual SlickEdit, MicroEdge's award-winning
programmer's editor-cum-development environment, was initially
released in 1988 as a DOS and OS/2 character-mode editor. This was
when IBM was marketing text-mode-only OS/2 as &ldquo;a better DOS than
DOS&rdquo;.
</p><p>Clark Maurer, currently CTO of MicroEdge and still active in
SlickEdit development, was employed at IBM's Watson research lab.
He was one of the developers of the legendary internal IBM editor
E; this experience enabled him to quit IBM and begin development of
the first SlickEdit releases.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1761580.0x1859a28"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Having installed an earlier version of SlickEdit from floppy
disks a couple of years ago, I anticipated no problems installing
version 5.0 from CD-ROM. A GUI installation interface makes the
process even easier than before, but I ended up with an installed
editor which wouldn't even start up. After an exchange of e-mail
and phone calls with MicroEdge's responsive and helpful service
personnel, I still couldn't get it to work. I e-mailed a core-dump
file to MicroEdge; it seems there were some compatibility problems
with the particular version of Debian I've been running, which
admittedly is the &ldquo;unstable&rdquo; release. The support staff even went
so far as to install Debian 2.0 on one of their test-bed machines,
and reported that SlickEdit started up just fine. Since there
didn't seem to be any immediate solution to this problem, I
installed SuSE Linux on a spare partition and soon had a functional
editor. I imagine this particular incompatibility hadn't come to
light before due to the nature of SlickEdit's normal user base,
which probably uses older and more proven versions of Linux.</p><p>Customization possibilities are extensive. Aside from the
expected keymap and syntax-highlighting adaptations which can be
made, menus and pop-up dialogs can be altered and even created from
scratch. Much of the editor's functionality is written in a C-like
language called Slick-C, but the language itself doesn't need to be
learned, as SlickEdit comes with a Slick-C IDE (integrated
development environment) called the Form Editor. With this editor
(which resembles Visual C), existing dialog boxes can be modified
and new ones created from scratch. These two screen shots
illustrate the HTML font dialog box opened for editing.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3823f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>Making the guts of a program accessible to users, which
enables almost unlimited tailoring of a program to individual (or
corporate) preferences, is a familiar concept to Emacs users, but
rare in commercial products.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3823f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1761580.0x1859f50"></a>Features</h2></div></div><p>SlickEdit is feature rich. Leaving aside the basic abilities
any good programmer's editor should have, this editor abounds with
useful functions, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>SlickEdit is unparalleled in its broad base of
supported platforms. Along with Linux, versions are available for
Solaris, HP-UX, Digital UNIX, Windows 95/98/NT, SGI-Irix and IBM
OS/390. The look and feel is identical across all platforms.</p></li><li><p>An extensive array of programming languages are
supported, while new languages can be added easily.</p></li><li><p>Context Tagging can be quite useful. Expression
type, scope and inheritance analysis are performed as you type.
Members and inherited members of objects are displayed in a dialog,
while at any time, you can navigate with a keystroke to the
definition of an identifier, including class members, functions and
variables.</p></li><li><p>Sophisticated file differencing (called DiffZilla)
is similar to the traditional Linux diff utilities, but is
controlled via dialog boxes and is thus easier to learn and use.
The Diff dialog can operate on multiple files in a directory tree,
while other directories can be excluded from the operation.</p></li><li><p>The search and replace functions are analogous to
those in Emacs, even to the extent of including the invaluable
incremental search, which allows searches to be completed as a
phrase or string is typed.</p></li><li><p>Up to fifteen clipboards are available. Their
contents are accessible from a dialog box and are saved between
sessions.</p></li><li><p>Window treatment is easily controlled from the menu
bar, especially important in an editor with so many possible
windows. Tiling, cascading and linking windows are among the
possibilities. All windows are confined within the main SlickEdit
window and can be positioned and resized just as any X window can
be.</p></li><li><p>Code beautification, which reformats indentation,
tag styles and brace styles to your preference, is helpful when
viewing or editing someone else's files. Version 5 of SlickEdit not
only lets you beautify C, C++ and Java files; now, JavaScript and
HTML (and HTML with embedded JavaScript) are also supported.</p></li><li><p>SmartPaste is another editing convenience. Paste a
cut or copied block of code into a file, and it will be re-indented
automatically to the appropriate level.</p></li><li><p>SlickEdit makes good use of the IDE-inspired
concept of projects, assemblages of source files and compiler
command lines along with the working directory. These can be loaded
as a unit and shared with other programmers. Another useful concept
is the workspace, a higher-level collection of projects.
Dependencies can be defined within projects in a workspace, so that
one project must be built before another. Projects can inhabit more
than one workspace, and (as with projects) workspaces can be shared
with colleagues. Visual SlickEdit can open workspaces and projects
created with Visual C++ and Tornado.</p></li><li><p>When more than one programmer is opening and
modifying files and projects, some form of version control is
essential. SlickEdit has built-in support for commercial
version-control systems such as ClearCase, SourceSafe, SCCS and
several others. Adding support for a new version-control system can
be done easily.</p></li><li><p>This release sports enhanced HTML-editing
capabilities. When used with the extensive collaborative and
distributed development features, SlickEdit has positioned itself
as a viable platform for web content creation.</p></li><li><p>Spell checking is exceptionally versatile in this
release. Checking can be limited to comments and strings in source
files, while HTML spell checking automatically ignores tags.
Multiple files can be checked with one command, even recursing down
into subdirectories.</p></li><li><p>Although it may seem odd for an editor to double as
an FTP client, this feature can, in effect, let a user edit files
on a remote machine as if they are local. Rather than manually
downloading, editing, then re-uploading files to a site, the
built-in FTP client lets these remote files appear and be accessed
as if they are in just another local directory.</p></li><li><p>Previous versions of SlickEdit allowed users to
emulate Emacs, Brief and vi key bindings, enabling UNIX users to
come up to speed quickly. Version 5 introduces Visual C++
emulation, providing a similar service to users in the Windows
camp.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1761580.0x185ab00"></a>Tagging and Tag Files</h2></div></div><p>Tagging of source and header files is an important part of
SlickEdit's functionality. Emacs and vi users will be familiar with
<span   class="bold"><b>ctags</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>etags</b></span>, two separate utilities for
generating tag files. Tagging is useful in any programming project
with more than a few source files, as it helps the programmer keep
track of just where functions and classes are defined. Usage of tag
files in SlickEdit is similar to that in Emacs; a keystroke summons
a window with the tag reference. SlickEdit's approach is easier to
learn for those unfamiliar with Emacs, vi and UNIX in general. As
with other UNIX-like functionality in SlickEdit, instead of using
separate command-line utilities with their own peculiar syntaxes,
etc., the tagging utilities are built into the editor and are
accessed via dialog boxes.</p><p>The first time a new user starts up SlickEdit, the
tag-generation utility attempts to build a tag-file database of
source-code files in the current directory, if any, and of general
compiler header files. In my case, the header files in
/usr/X11R6/include and /usr/include, as well as the Linux kernel
source header files, were all catalogued. Tag files are used by the
Class Browser, allowing the user to quickly find classes,
functions, variables and other code constructs referred to in
source files.</p><p>SlickEdit's tagging facility is an impressive piece of work,
effectively bringing an esoteric and somewhat abstruse but
enormously useful facility to a broader programming
community.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1761580.0x18515f8"></a>Documentation</h2></div></div><p>Bucking the lamentable software industry trend toward less
documentation, SlickEdit is bundled with a three-hundred-page
hard-copy manual, and the same material is also available on-line
through an integrated help facility. This documentation is clearly
written and well-illustrated. A complete reference to the Slick-C
language is included, a helpful feature for project leaders with a
desire to tailor the editor to the work at hand.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3823f3.large.jpg"><img src="3823f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3.
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1761580.0x18518b8"></a>Free vs. Commercial</h2></div></div><p>At $295.00 per copy ($99.00 for an upgrade from a previous
version), prospective users might wonder if the program is worth
that much, considering so many free, high-quality editors are
available for Linux, each with active and responsive developer and
user communities. The answer is: it all depends on how much time
you have available for learning to use an editor effectively, and
even more important, how much time and inclination your co-workers
have to spare. Nearly all of the functionality of SlickEdit can be
duplicated by the various versions of Emacs or vi, but only at the
expense of time for tracking down the necessary packages and
configurations. This may be second nature for programmers imbued
with the UNIX philosophy, but what about that co-worker who is more
accustomed to Visual C++? SlickEdit provides a sort of neutral
ground, an environment which is acceptable to programmers from a
variety of backgrounds. The cross-platform nature of this editor is
one of its strongest selling points, especially significant now
that more and more commercial software is being released in
versions for a variety of operating systems.</p><p>SlickEdit probably won't appeal to many solitary or academic
programmers; its niche is corporate programming environments, where
a common style of code and project files can increase
productivity.</p><p>

</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1761580.0x1851c28"></a>Availability</h2></div></div><p>MicroEdge maintains a web site for SlickEdit users and
prospective customers at

Patches for registered users are available there, as well as macros

Windows applications quickly ported to Linux. MicroEdge has been
supporting Linux for several years now, and this is evident in the
stability and usability of the editor. While SlickEdit may be
priced out of the range of the typical Linux home user, the price
is not out of line for a product intended for business use. The
advantages for group usage, including sharing files, projects and
configurations, along with excellent support from MicroEdge, make
the product a good value in its intended market.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1761580.0x1851e90"></a>The Goods</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Cross-platform</p></li><li><p>Excellent documentation</p></li><li><p>Extensive customization</p></li><li><p>Feature rich</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1761580.0x1852258"></a>The Bads</h2></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>price will not appeal to home user</p></li></ul></div></div></div>
