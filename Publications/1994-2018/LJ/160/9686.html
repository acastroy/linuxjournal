Follow these procedures for the smoothest path to great embedded Linux.

Procedures for developing embedded systems are very complicated. New
engineers typically take a long time to become familiar with these
procedures. Therefore, we have developed a standard operating procedure (SOP)
to save the costs of constructing an embedded system and reduce the
complexity. The SOP includes five standard procedures
for building a Linux-based embedded system, as shown in Figure 1. You
can follow the procedures discussed in this article for building a prototypal system. Also,
we introduce ten useful methods for downsizing your system. Finally, we
show the effect of these methods on downsizing your embedded system&mdash;a content-aware network security gateway.

Figure 1. Procedures and Methods for Building and Downsizing Your Embedded
Systems
</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1656580.0x174ed40"></a>
Five Standard Procedures</h2></div></div><p>
To build an embedded system, the first step is to select a target
platform. The platform involves both hardware and software. The hardware
platform includes the processor, bus and I/O; the software platform
includes the bootloader, kernel and root filesystem. You must 
select each item in the target platform carefully to ensure that the hardware and
software work together. For instance, bootloaders relate directly to the hardware. If the selected bootloader does not support your hardware
platform, the whole embedded system cannot power on. Moreover,
an operating system that requires MMU may fail to collaborate with
MMU-supported processors.
</p><p>
Second, in addition to the target platform, a development platform 
also is necessary. You cannot compile embedded software programs on the
target platform, because the target platform often has a small RAM and
slow CPU to minimize cost and power consumption. Therefore, you need to
prepare a development platform with a fast CPU and large RAM to compile
these programs. Besides, because the two platforms have different hardware
architectures, a cross-compiler environment is necessary. Buildroot is
such a package to offer this environment. It has a friendly user interface
to assist in choosing the hardware platform and the required software
package. By using Buildroot, you can generate a cross-compilation
toolchain and a root filesystem easily with built-in application packages
for your embedded system.
</p><p>
After setting up the environment, the next step is identifying the
packages required by your system. You can accomplish this by 
selecting the built-in packages directly from the menuconfig of Buildroot, or
you can download them from the Internet. In fact, Buildroot provides a list
of useful packages, such as iproute2, freeswan and squid. Buildroot also
ensures that these packages can link successfully with uClibc, a C library
with a smaller size than Glibc. If you cannot find the suitable
packages, you will have to modify existing packages or write new ones.
</p><p>
Having obtained the required packages, the next step is integrating them
into the embedded system. Integrating here means using a cross-compiler
to compile the source code into forms that can be executed in the target
platform, and then adding them into the root filesystem. You can add
packages into the root filesystem through Buildroot in any of three
ways, as shown in Figure 2. Method 1 is to select them directly from
the options in Buildroot. If the packages are not available in Buildroot,
you may need to write a makefile for the package to indicate how to
download, configure, compile and install the package. Also, you need to
modify the config.in file of Buildroot to display the option of the package
in the configuration menu. However, if you would not like to write these
configuration files, you can use Method 2. In Method 2, you simply
place the compiled packages in the directory named customize,
and then Buildroot copies these compiled packages into the root filesystem during the building procedures, according to the rules given in
customize.mk. However, if you simply want to verify the functionality of
a single package, you don't need to rebuild the whole image. The
steps in Method 3 are to mount the root filesystem on any one directory
and then copy the compiled packages into the directory. Finally, unmount
the directory, and you will get an updated root image. However, Method
3 may fail if the free space in the mounted filesystem is not enough
for the new packages. In that case, you can adjust the parameters given
in ext2root.mk to reserve more free space in your root filesystem
during the period of system development.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9686f2.large.jpg"><img src="9686f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Three Methods for Adding Packages into Your Root Filesystem
</p></div></div><p>
Finally, Figure 2 depicts two ways to test and verify whether the
functions of a package are normal. The basic way is to download the
root filesystem into the target platform and execute the package
directly. However, doing this usually takes a long time. Another way is to
boot the
root filesystem in a virtual machine, such as QEMU and VMware. Using
a virtual machine to examine a compiled image is fast and convenient, but
a virtual machine may not simulate some characteristics, such as hardware
interrupts. Hardware interrupts involve quick reaction behavior,
so they cannot be implemented by virtual machines easily. Finally, if the target
platform has the same CPU architecture as your development platform,
you can use chroot to replace your local system with the target root
filesystem.
</p><p>
By following the five procedures outlined, you can build the root
filesystem for your embedded system. However, there is still one problem
that
may be troubling you&mdash;how to downsize your embedded systems or how to
use less Flash RAM to store the kernel and root filesystem. Requiring
less RAM means that you can cut the cost of your embedded system.

Ten Downsizing Methods</h2></div></div><p>
The organization of the downsizing issue is displayed in the bottom of
Figure 1. We divide the methods into two parts, because the software
platform of an embedded system typically consists of a kernel and root
filesystem. The first part is how to get a small kernel, and the second
part is how to downsize each component in the root filesystem, including
libraries and shells. The second part also discusses how to compress
the whole root filesystem. We describe all methods in detail below,
along with experimental results. After explaining all methods, we show
the effect of these methods on our laboratory embedded system, called
the Wall system. Table 1 presents the specification for the Wall system. The
system is a network security gateway that provides application-layer
content filters, such as antispam and antivirus.

Methods for the Linux Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
Selecting an appropriate kernel is the first step in downsizing the
kernel. If you choose an inappropriate kernel, the system may 
be not only large but also unable to use processor power effectively. For
example, a standard Linux kernel on a hardware platform without MMU
cannot work normally. Such a hardware platform requires a specific
MMU-less kernel, such as uClinux. 
Most people use the standard Linux kernel and attempt to trim its size.
</p><p>
The next step is to include only the necessary modules in the standard Linux
kernel by a correct configuration. In fact, the default configuration
of a Linux kernel includes many unused modules, which causes you to have a
big kernel. Figure 3(a) shows the experimental results on the downsizing
effect of the correct configuration. In this case, a system supporting TCP/IP
has a kernel image that is only 59.84% of the size of a system supporting
all network protocols.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9686f3.large.jpg"><img src="9686f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Effects of the Downsizing Methods on the Kernel
</p></div></div><p>
To downsize the kernel, the third step is to use the optimization
parameters when compiling the kernel. Using parameters -O1, -O2 or -O3
can improve performance, and using -Os can reduce size. However, optimizing for
both performance and size simultaneously is not possible. Therefore,
we generally select -O2 to achieve a balance between size and
performance. As shown in Figure 3(b), the -Os parameter reduces the
size of the kernel image by 22.82% as compared with -O3, but it causes
worse performance.
</p><p>
Besides including only the necessary modules and compiling the kernel with
the optimal parameters, to downsize the kernel further, you can decrease
the size of the static buffer and array allocated in the kernel, because the
kernel typically declares a large buffer and array for standard PCs. To
find out which buffer or array occupies large memory space, you can use the
command nm. This command can list the allocated size of each variable
in an object file. With that information, you can browse the corresponding
source code of the object file and alter the initial size of the buffer
or array. Another approach for shrinking the buffer size is to modify the
options in the menuconfig of the kernel to decrease the maximum number
of supported peripherals, as shown in Figure 3(c) and (d).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1656580.0x1a5b5d0"></a>
Methods for the Root Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>
As shown in Figure 1, we identify six methods for downsizing the root filesystem. First, you can adopt a tool called BusyBox, which provides a
fairly complete environment for any small or embedded system. BusyBox
combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small
executable file, and it is highly modular, allowing commands to be included
or excluded at compile time. The space used for BusyBox is 7.04% of that
of the original tool, as demonstrated in Figure 4.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9686f4.large.jpg"><img src="9686f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Effects of Downsizing Methods on the Root Filesystem
</p></div></div><p>
Next, we introduce three methods for removing unused libraries or
downsizing required
libraries. First, you can use the command ldd to identify the required
shared libraries for each program, and then with this information, you can
remove the unused libraries. Notably, if a shared library is not used
by programs, you additionally should check whether it is used by other
shared libraries. Figure 4 shows that removing redundant libraries
reduces the root filesystem to 6.55% of its original size. Second,
you can replace the standard C library with a small C library, such as
uClibc, Newlib or diet libc. Such libraries remove the unused functions,
so their size is smaller than Glibc, as shown in Table 2. This table
presents the differences in functionality between the four libraries.
Third, you can use a library optimizer tool named Libopt to rebuild the
libraries that include the only necessary functions for the executable
programs and shared libraries found in the root filesystem. This tool
utilizes objdump and nm to gather information about library object files,
shared libraries and executable programs.

The fifth method for downsizing the root filesystem is to
remove unnecessary documents. You can eliminate some directories, such as
/home, /mnt, /opt, /root, /boot and /proc, if unused. You also can remove
the man, info, include and example directories to reduce the size when
additionally integrating a package into the root filesystem. In general,
an embedded system executes only specific programs, so users can operate
it easily without the help documents or examples in these directories.
</p><p>
The final method is to avoid uncompressing the whole root filesystem
into SDRAM. The root filesystem is compressed to save the stored
space, for example, Flash RAM. However, after the filesystem is uncompressed
into SDRAM, the Flash memory allocated for the filesystem is no longer
necessary. For instance, if the compressed size of the root filesystem
is 4MB and its compression rate is 50%, the system occupies 4MB of
Flash memory and 8MB of SDRAM. Therefore, the system wastes much memory
storage, because of the duplicate data. For this problem, you can use
CRAMFS. CRAMFS is a read-only filesystem, designed for simplicity and
space efficiency. You do not need to uncompress a CRAMFS image before
mounting it. A CRAMFS image is zlib-compressed, one page at a time to
enable random read access. The metadata is not compressed, but is
expressed in a terse representation that is more space-efficient than
in traditional filesystems, such as ext2 or FAT. However, due to the
read-only property of compressed files, random write access is hard to
implement for them. As shown in Figure 4, CRAMFS compresses the
filesystem to 12.77% of its original size.
</p><p>
Now that we've covered the six methods, let's move on to the effect of these methods
on the Wall Project, as shown in Figure 5. First, we used BusyBox
to substitute for the multiple utility programs used in the original
shell. Then, we compiled all the required packages with the parameters
--strip-unneeded and -O2. Next, we used the commands strip and objcopy
to remove the unnecessary contents of packages. Finally, we deleted
unnecessary directories, such as man, info and example. Figure 5(a)
illustrates the result of these processes. However, the size of Wall
was still 139MB. Hence, we had to view the contents of /usr indepth, as shown in Figure 5(b) and (c). In the Wall Project, removing
unneeded documents and files saved 20.6MB of space. About 15.9MB
of space then can be saved by eliminating unused libraries. However,
as you can see, Perl occupied much space in our system. Other methods may
exist to solve this problem, but it is sufficient to consider only what
we have done above.
</p><p>
We found that the optimization of package size is also useful
for downsizing when integrating a new package into the root filesystem. Actually, most programs and libraries are compiled
at optimizing level 2 by default (gcc options -g and -O2) and are compiled
for a specific CPU. On Intel platforms, software is compiled for i386
processors by default. To minimize the package size, you should
not adopt the -g option, which adds the debug info in the execution
files. Additionally, remember to use -strip and --strip-all to remove
all symbols. In more-advanced methods, we used the command readelf to check
for any redundant sections in the execution files, and we used objcopy to remove
those redundant sections. However, this approach may be not efficient
for small programs.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
This article describes the five procedures for making a Linux-based
embedded system and describes ten methods for downsizing the kernel
and the root filesystem. After we used these methods, our Wall Project
was downsized by 26.18%. The experiment's results reveal that the two
most efficient methods are giving correct kernel compilation
parameters and using simplified tools and libraries in the root filesystem.
Hopefully, this article helps you understand the procedures
and problems when building a Linux-based embedded system.
