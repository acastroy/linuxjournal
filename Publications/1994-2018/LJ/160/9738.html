Getting started with Django views and templates, with an eye to
the Django way of working.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e18580.0x1f103a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, we began looking at Django, a popular framework for
creating Web applications in Python. Django has the reputation of being the
&ldquo;Ruby on Rails of the Python world&rdquo;, and there is some justification
for that description. Even though Django was developed in parallel
with Rails and has many unique features that distinguish it from its
Ruby counterpart, it's difficult to avoid comparing the two.
</p><p>
In the introduction to Django last month, we saw a
number of subtle, but important, differences between the two systems.
Django handles a &ldquo;project&rdquo; at a time, where each project may contain
one or more applications. This contrasts with the Rails approach, in
which there is no real equivalent to Django's projects, because
everything is an application. 
</p><p>
We also saw that Django comes with a built-in Web-based administrative
system. It takes a tiny bit of fiddling with a configuration file to
activate this administrative system, but it provides a great number of
benefits to any system that uses it.
</p><p>
Despite their differences, both Django and Rails use an approach that
is best known as MVC (model, view, controller) developed in the
Smalltalk community but adopted by many other languages and frameworks
since then. These terms, used verbatim in the Rails world, are called
models, templates and views in the Django world, and they form the
bulk of a Django-based site.
</p><p>
This month, we work with templates and views, ignoring models and
the database API until next month. But, don't worry; Django's
templates are quite powerful, and they provide an interesting lesson in
restraint.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e18580.0x1f107c0"></a>
Creating an Application</h2></div></div><p>
Our first step involves creating a new application within our
project. For a number of reasons, including the simplicity with which
we can create a page, our example application is a very
simple blog program. We create our blog application by switching into
our project directory, and then by using our management program,
manage.py:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ cd /opt/atf/mysite
$ python manage.py startapp blog
</pre>
</p><p>
If this executes successfully, Django won't print any messages.
Rather, we can get a listing of the current directory, which should
now include a blog subdirectory:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ls blog
__init__.py  models.py  views.py
</pre>
</p><p>
Django is smart enough to stop us from creating an application twice,
if we try to do so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ python manage.py startapp blog
Error: [Errno 17] File exists: '/opt/atf/mysite/blog'
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's create a simple &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; view, just so we can
demonstrate that things are working. Thus, we open 
blog/views.py, which starts off empty except for a comment indicating
that this is the file in which views are defined.
</p><p>
The simplest possible &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo; view will be called index,
acting sort of like the index method in Rails or the index.html file
on a Web site&mdash;providing the default content when no specific method
is invoked for an application. We also have to import the Python
module in which Django's HTTP response capabilities are defined. When
we're done, the entire views.py file looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
return HttpResponse("Hello, world.")
</pre>
</p><p>
If our server isn't already running, we can start it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python manage.py runserver
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, if we want to run on a publicly accessible IP address, rather than
127.0.0.1 (&ldquo;localhost&rdquo;), we can do something like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
python manage.py runserver 69.55.232.87:8000
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e18580.0x1f10e48"></a>
URLConf</h2></div></div><p>
To see the output from our view, let's point our browser to the following
URL, expecting to see &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo;:
http://69.55.232.87:8000/blog/.
Instead, we get an error message, indicating that Django has no idea
what we're talking about. The good news is that this error message,
which is turned on only when we are developing an application, tells
us what we did wrong&mdash;namely, that our URLConf definition failed to
have any entry for blog in it.
</p><p>
This is a fundamental difference between Django and Rails, and it
reflects the different philosophies of the two communities. In Rails,
you expect the system to do the right thing by default; you should
have to say something only when it deviates from that norm. In
contrast, Django assumes that you want to make everything
explicit.
</p><p>
Among the things that you need to make explicit is the way in which
URLs are translated into method calls. The Django system for doing
this is called URLConf, and it is a set of regular expressions defined
for the entire project. (It functions something like routes in
Rails.) If you are familiar with regular expressions, it should
be pretty easy to add or modify URLConf.
</p><p>
For example, let's say we want the /blog/ URL to go to our blog
application. So, we would open the URLConf file, which for the
mysite project will be in mysite/urls.py. (We already modified
this last month, when we added administrative capabilities to our
Django site.) We then add a line that looks like the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
(r'^blog/$', 'mysite.blog.views.index')
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, if the system sees a URL that begins with blog and
ends with /, it should invoke the index method within views.py in
our blog application. And, sure enough, as soon as we save urls.py
to disk, we can reload our URL http://69.55.232.87:8000/blog/,
and in our browser, we see &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo;.
Our Django application is starting to come together.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e18580.0x1f11210"></a>
More Complex URLs</h2></div></div><p>
Things are not that interesting if all we have is a single method and
if it always does the same thing. For a blog application, we'll
presumably want to be able to read a particular posting, or postings,
on a particular day. And although we'll get into the model for our blog
application next month, it stands to reason that this means we'll need
to be able to request blog postings by an individual ID or by date.
</p><p>
Our current URLConf doesn't handle such situations. Indeed, Django
requires that we explicitly indicate each possible URL that a user
might request and how that URL should be handled. So although we have
taken care of blog/, we need to handle such URLs as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
^blog/ID
</pre>
</p><p>
Luckily, it should be pretty straightforward for us to set up a
regular expression that captures such functionality. If we open
urls.py once again, we can add another statement:


<pre     class="programlisting">

(r'^blog/(?P&lt;post_id&gt;\d+)/$', 'mysite.blog.views.view_one_posting')

</pre>
</p><p>
Here, we see something a bit strange and different, namely the use of
capturing parentheses, along with ?P and names inside angle
brackets. We tell URLConf that whenever we receive a URL that looks
like /blog/NUMBER, with one or more digits, we should invoke
view_one_posting. Moreover, because we have captured the digits (\d+,
in regular expressions) with the name post_id, view_one_posting will
be invoked with an additional parameter of post_id.
</p><p>
In other words, once we've modified urls.py to include the above
mapping, we now can go back to views.py and say the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
def view_one_posting(request, post_id):
return HttpResponse("You asked for post '%s'" % post_id)
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, we can go to http://69.55.232.87:8000/blog/5,
and in our browser, we get the following response:

<pre     class="programlisting">
You asked for post '5'
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that in the view_one_posting method, we used %s (for strings)
to render post_id, rather than %d (for integers). This is because
parameters and URLs are passed as strings, rather than integers or
other data types. We could, of course, get around this problem by
converting the string to an integer, but for our purposes right now,
this is enough.
</p><p>
Perhaps this goes without saying, but each method in our Django
application is a Python method whose output just happens to be sent to
the user's Web browser. You can use any number of Python libraries
that you want, and even access databases, filesystems and remote
computers. So long as the output is returned as a legitimate HTTP
response, your method will work. The application we are building in
these examples represents the tip of the iceberg, as far as
implementation complexity is concerned.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1e18580.0x1f117e8"></a>
Templates</h2></div></div><p>
If we wanted to, we could create a whole Web site using nothing more
than the tools we've already seen. However, it quickly would become
difficult, and even tedious, to do so, putting all of our output
strings as parameters to HttpResponse. The real solution is to put
the HTML in external files, interpolating variable values as
necessary.
</p><p>
There are a lot of different templating solutions out there, and each
has its advantages and disadvantages. The most common type is that
used by ASP, PHP, JSP and ERb&mdash;the last of which is part of Ruby on
Rails&mdash;in which the code is interspersed with the HTML. This type
of template can be extremely easy for programmers to work with, but
it can cause trouble when nonprogramming designers are involved, or if
you just want to have a complete separation between code and design.
</p><p>
Such templates can be used by Django, but they are not the default.
Rather, Django uses templates that are similar in many ways to the
Smarty system for PHP, which avoids the use of actual code in the
template by introducing its own, deliberately limited language. So
long as a view can pass values to a template, there's no real need for
a full-blown programming language inside of a template. It's probably
enough to have if/then statements and some basic loops. 
</p><p>
This is what Django's default template system provides. In order to
use templates, we first modify the settings.py file that sits in the
project's main directory. We want to set the TEMPLATE_DIRS variable,
giving it a list of one or more directories in which our templates
might be found. For example, we could set it to:

<pre     class="programlisting">
TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
"/opt/atf/mysite/templates"
)
</pre>
</p><p>
With this in place, now we create the appropriate directories:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir -p /opt/atf/mysite/templates/blog
</pre>
</p><p>
And, then we create, in that blog subdirectory, a new HTML file, which
we call view_one_posting.html:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;One post&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the "view_one_posting" template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Now, we modify views.py, such that our view_one_posting method can
invoke this template. We add the following import statement at the
top of the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
from django.template import Context, loader
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, we modify view_one_posting to be:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def view_one_posting(request, post_id):
t = loader.get_template('blog/view_one_posting.html')
c = Context({})
return HttpResponse(t.render(c))
</pre>
</p><p>
Our template is loaded into the variable t, and the context&mdash;that
is, the variable values we want to pass to our template&mdash;is bound to
the variable c. We then tell the template to render itself within
the context c. In this particular example, we aren't passing any
variables in the context, so it is represented by an empty dictionary.
</p><p>
And, if we reload the URL /blog/5 on our site, we should see the
following in the browser window:

<pre     class="programlisting">
This is the "view_one_posting" template.
</pre>
</p><p>
That's certainly better than what we had before, in that the contents of
the template are easier to handle (by programmers and designers alike)
than a string inside of a view method. But, how do we pass variables
to be interpolated?
</p><p>
The answer is quite simple. In the view method, we can pass any
variable we like to the template using the context dictionary, in
which the keys are the passed variable names, and the values are the
passed variable values. So, we can say:

<pre     class="programlisting">
def view_one_posting(request, post_id):
t = loader.get_template('blog/view_one_posting.html')
c = Context({'post_id': post_id})
return HttpResponse(t.render(c))
</pre>
</p><p>
If we want to see this value in our template, we can view it in double
curly braces:

<pre     class="programlisting">

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;One post&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is the "view_one_posting" template.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The post_id is {{post_id}}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
And, sure enough, when we render this template, we get:

<pre     class="programlisting">
This is the "view_one_posting" template.

The post_id is 5.
</pre>

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Django, like Rails and many other Web frameworks, uses MVC to divide
the work between models, views and templates. This month, we saw how
to connect a URL to a view, how to pass one or more URL parameters to
a view and how to invoke a template from a view.
</p><p>
Next month, we will see how to integrate databases and data models
into a Django application.
