Motorola's RAZR<sup  >2</sup> V8</h2></div></div><p>
Motorola started tinkering with Linux on mobile phones as an experiment
in China, which was supported, interestingly, by the Chinese government.
Because the company was so impressed with Linux, our beloved OS is
becoming ever-more common on its mobile devices. One of the latest
Linux-powered options is the RAZR<sup  >2</sup> V8, a
next-generation edition of this
popular handset line. The RAZR<sup  >2</sup> V8 features up to 500 minutes of talk
time, quad-band connectivity, up to 2GB of memory, a two-megapixel
camera, Opera Web browser, independent speech recognition and music
management based on Windows Media Player 11. Motorola was coy about
the latter feature, divulging only that it has licensed audio codecs,
DRM and transfer protocols from Microsoft and integrated them into its
Linux-Java platform. Still, it calms the Linux-questing soul to know that
one can intentionally go out and get a butt-kicking Linux-based phone!

Kyle Wheeler's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Qmail Quickstarter</em></span> (Packt Publishing)</h2></div></div><p>
If qmail's home page is too unwieldy for you, pick up Kyle Wheeler's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Qmail Quickstarter</em></span>, a new book for folks familiar with Linux/UNIX and
DNS servers who desire to set up a qmail mail server. Starting with the
basics, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Qmail Quickstarter</em></span> moves on to getting e-mail
messages in and out of the queue,
along with storing, retrieving and authenticating them. The book also
covers virtualisation of domains and user management, filtering spam, SSL
encryption and mailing lists. Packt says that the book's style focuses
on practical examples that system administrators can use right away,
but that it also explains the rationale behind every example.

Drew Technologies' DashDAQ</h2></div></div><p>
As the Detroit automakers obsessively perfect the cupholder, Drew
Technologies seeks to sneak a slick Linux-based device, the DashDAQ, on
board your new ride. The DashDAQ, says DrewTech, is &ldquo;a cross between
an automotive gauge, dashboard, navigation system, data acquisition
system, trip recorder, diagnostic tool and a handheld computer.&rdquo;
The device was designed for use as an automotive display, includes OBD2
communications protocols and runs on Linux (yesss!). The software that
is included with DashDAQ allows users to create their own themes and
automotive gauge skins. Other features include dual-ARM architecture,
4" (QWVGA) 24-bit TFT color display, a touchscreen and 64MB of RAM.
The product is available through resellers, distributors and directly
from DrewTech.

Ulrik Pilegaard and Mike Dooley's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Forbidden LEGO</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
Book publishers seem to release their books in waves, and presently we
find ourselves in the midst of a geek-book tsunami. The ever-eclectic
No Starch Press continues to pack its LEGO Mindstorms series with fun
titles, the latest being <span   class="emphasis"><em>Forbidden LEGO</em></span> by Ulrik Pilegaard and Mike
Dooley, subtitled cheekily as &ldquo;Build the Models Your Parents Warned You
Against&rdquo;. Presto, rebellion accomplished! <span   class="emphasis"><em>Forbidden
LEGO</em></span> focuses on
&ldquo;free-style building&rdquo; and shows you how to make zany models,
such as &ldquo;a
toy gun that shoots LEGO plates, a candy catapult, a high-voltage LEGO
vehicle, a continuous-fire ping-pong ball launcher and other useless
but incredibly fun inventions.&rdquo; A word to the wise: stock up on LEGOs
in advance!

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Data Structures and Algorithms for Game Developers</em></span> by Allen Sherrod
(Charles River Media)</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></span> ain't <span   class="emphasis"><em>Pong</em></span>,
which is why you'll need this book&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>Data Structures and
Algorithms for Game Developers</em></span> by Allen Sherrod&mdash;for your next game undertaking. Published by Charles River Media,
this title focuses on teaching game developers the fundamentals of data
structures and algorithms using C++ and its alternative options, such as
C++ STL. The book also covers many topics that today's game and graphics
programmers must know to be successful, including geometry management
techniques, KD-Trees, binary space partitioning trees, sphere trees and so
on.
Furthermore, the code that's included is not platform- or OS-dependent,
which is just as we Linuxers like it!
