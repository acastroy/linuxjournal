Create a shell script to get a taste of being Bond, James Bond.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2884580.0x297c450"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I was recently watching <span   class="emphasis"><em>Casino Royale</em></span> and thinking about the James Bond
series, particularly how Sean Connery was so much more sophisticated
as Bond than Daniel Craig. Connery was more debonair, and one of the
ways he'd demonstrate it was by playing a mysterious high-stakes game
called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> while surrounded by gorgeous
women in casinos in Monte Carlo.
</p><p>
Well, I can't create a casino as a shell script, and I certainly can't
create either a secret agent or a gorgeous female sidekick, but I can
create a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> game as a shell script. Heck, it's probably the first
time anyone's even attempted it!
</p><p>
If you've been a faithful reader of this column since the beginning,
you'll know that almost two years ago we started out by writing a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blackjack</em></span> game as a shell script. It was a long-winded affair (I didn't
just say that, did I?), but as part of the project, we created a simple
way to emulate a deck of cards, &ldquo;shuffle&rdquo; the cards (that is, put them
in quasi-random order) and even convert a numeric 1&ndash;52 value into a
suit and rank.
</p><p>
We'll use that as the starting point for creating our
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> game,
so we can focus on the complicated rules. Let's start there.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2884580.0x297c978"></a>
The Basics of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> has been around since the mid-1400s, and the variation I'll be
coding, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Punto Banco</em></span>, is completely rule-based with no skill involved. Two
cards are dealt to both the player and banker and, depending on those
cards, a third might be dealt to one or both. Face cards are worth zero,
and numeric cards are worth face value. You add the value of a hand and
its final value is that value modulo 10. The higher point value wins,
and if they're identical, it's a tie.
</p><p>
For example, if the player was dealt a 7H and a 3C, that'd be worth zero
(7 + 3 = 10 % 10 = 0). A 6S and 2D is better though; it's worth 8. And,
finally, a 9 + 3 + J = 2. Got it? The best possible hand is worth
9 points.
</p><p>
If either the banker or player have 8 or 9 points, no further cards are
dealt to either, and the game ends with the dealer or player winning or
in a tie. If the player has an initial total of 0&ndash;5 points,
the player can draw one additional card.
</p><p>
The banker's play at this point is sufficiently complicated that I'll
defer explaining it until next issue. For now, let's just look at how
to code these rudiments of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span>.
</p><p>
Ready, Mr Bond?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2884580.0x297cd40"></a>
Capturing the Basics of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span></h2></div></div><p>
The first piece of the puzzle is pretty straightforward&mdash;a shell
function that returns a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> value for a given sequence of cards
(integer 1&ndash;52):

<pre     class="programlisting">
function handValue
{
   handvalue=0  # initialize
   for cardvalue
   do
     if [ $cardvalue -ge 0 ] ; then
       rankvalue=$(( $cardvalue % 13 ))
       case $rankvalue in
         0|11|12 ) rankvalue=0  ;;
         1       ) rankvalue=11 ;;
       esac

       handvalue=$(( $handvalue + $rankvalue ))
     fi
   done

   handvalue=$(( $handvalue % 10 ))
}
</pre>
</p><p>
This function makes it easy to calculate the value of a hand&mdash;whether
it will have two or three cards. Here's a typical invocation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
handValue ${player[1]} ${player[2]}
</pre>
</p><p>
The result is returned as the global variable handvalue, which is
calculated by summing up the individual rankvalue of each card.
</p><p>
Dealing the cards is accomplished by initializing things:

<pre     class="programlisting">
initializeDeck
shuffleDeck
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, here's actually dealing out the cards from newdeck into the player and
dealer arrays:

<pre     class="programlisting">
player[1]=${newdeck[1]}
player[2]=${newdeck[3]}
nextplayercard=3        

dealer[1]=${newdeck[2]}
dealer[2]=${newdeck[4]}
nextdealercard=3        
</pre>
</p><p>
Realistically, if it's a shuffled deck, it would be an identical
result to have the first two cards go to the player and the next two
dealt to the dealer, but since we're trying to emulate the actual sequence
of events at a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> game, I'm dealing cards #1 and #3 to the player
and #2 and #4 to the dealer.
</p><p>
The next step is to calculate the value of both the player and dealer
hands, which can be done with the handValue function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
handValue ${player[1]} ${player[2]}
playerhandvalue=$handvalue
handValue ${dealer[1]} ${dealer[2]}
dealerhandvalue=$handvalue
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, let's test to see if we're done with the hand because either player
or banker has a hand value of 8 or 9:


<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $playerhandvalue -ge 8 -o $dealerhandvalue -ge 8 ] ; then
  echo -n "Play is complete. "
  showResult
  exit 0
fi
</pre>
</p><p>
The showResult function simply calculates (and displays) who won:


<pre     class="programlisting">
function showResult
{

   if [ $dealerhandvalue -gt $playerhandvalue ] ; then
     echo "Dealer wins"
     result=1
   elif [ $dealerhandvalue -lt $playerhandvalue ] ; then
     echo "Player wins"
     result=2
   else
     echo "Tie"
     result=3
   fi
}
</pre>
</p><p>
I'll stop here, but next column, I'll pick up the task by examining how
to test whether the player should get a third card. Then, we'll really
dig into the rules for the banker and start running some games!
</p><p>
Note: I have leaned heavily on Wikipedia's information on
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span> for the
rules and history of the game (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccarat" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccarat</a>). I'm
focused on what's called <span   class="emphasis"><em>Punto Banco</em></span>, the so-called North-American-rules
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat</em></span>. If you, like Bond, prefer
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat Chemin de Fer</em></span> or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Baccarat
Banque</em></span>, you can tweak things as necessary.
