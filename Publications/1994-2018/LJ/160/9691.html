You may not need as much as you think to build a residential gateway.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb8240"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Before embedded Linux became the de facto standard for networking devices,
building a residential gateway (RG) or similar appliance used to be
an expensive and nontrivial task. Real-time operating systems (RTOSes)
used on these kinds of devices, such as VxWorks or pSOS, are relatively
expensive and lack many features needed for an RG, which has to be purchased
separately. VxWorks 5.5, for example, comes with a TCP/IP stack that has
performance problems and does not even implement an L2 bridge, not to mention
a firewall. This situation created a business opportunity for a number of
companies, such as Ashley Laurent and Jungo, who sell RG software 
stacks for various OSes. The advent of embedded Linux distributions,
such as uClinux, reduced the process of building an RG to choosing the
right hardware, writing the drivers for peripherals and adding
some kind of Web-based configuration utility. Embedded Linux reduced the
development and cost of RG devices not only by providing many important
features that either were missing or expensive in RTOSes, but also by
easing the integration and debugging of drivers and applications, thanks
to the clear POSIX driver model and kernel/user-mode separation.
</p><p>
However, Linux dominance in the embedded networking market is now
challenged by new technologies. In the past, RG devices with ADSL,
DOCSIS and 802.11 peripherals rarely were required to pass throughput
beyond 10Mbps. New technologies, such as 802.11n and PON, make 100Mbps
throughput a reality, challenging embedded engineers with the task of
creating RGs capable of handling much higher traffic on the same or at
least similarly priced hardware.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb84a8"></a>
Anatomy of the Residential Gateway</h2></div></div><p>
Before designing your own residential gateway, it may be worth taking
a closer look at one of these devices.
</p><p>
If you decide to take a look inside your 802.11 access point or ADSL
gateway, which probably will void your warranty, you will find an
embedded board with a CPU (probably some MIPS variant), Ethernet switch,
ADSL/DOCSIS and 802.11 chips, as illustrated in Figure 1.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9691f1.large.jpg"><img src="9691f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. RG Hardware Block Diagram
</p></div></div><p>
Some (or even all) of the above can be integrated into one piece of
silicon to form a System-on-Chip (SoC). On the other hand, you 
also may find the same stock mini-PCI (mPCI) 802.11 card connected to an
embedded board as the one you will find in your laptop.
</p><p>
Chances are, your home gateway runs Linux. If you'd like to know
for sure or maybe hack a bit on it, you have to solder the UART
connector, which is relatively easy (most boards come with UART enabled,
but without a connector). The software stack usually includes some
version of Linux (2.4.x kernels are still pretty common in the embedded
world), the usual user-space utilities and libraries, peripheral drivers
and a configuration utility&mdash;either command-line interface (CLI), Web or both,
as shown in Figure 2. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9691f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb8a28"></a>
Software</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have a general picture of what makes a residential gateway,
and assuming you have working hardware (more details on hardware later
in this article), let's
see what pieces of software you'll need. At the bare minimum, you need
kernel sources, some variant of the libc library, basic user-mode utilities
(at least a shell) and a cross-compiler toolchain to build them all. In
short, you need an embedded Linux distribution. uClinux is a good choice,
as it supports a wide range of CPUs (not necessarily CPUs without MMU, as
the name might imply), comes with many useful user-mode utilities and has
an easy-to-use kernel-style configuration system for all the packages. As
always, the choice is not limited only to one distribution. There are
a variety of free and commercial Linux distributions from which to
choose.
</p><p>
Assuming your board (not just the CPU) is supported by uClinux,
the process of building a working image boils down to downloading the
distribution itself and the cross-compiler toolchain for your CPU and
then
simply following the build instructions. If your board is not supported
by uClinux, chances are the board manufacturer will provide a board
support package (BSP)&mdash;that is, adapt uClinux (or some other Linux version)
to that hardware. If this is not the case, you have to write the BSP
yourself, which is beyond the scope of this article.
</p><p>
The major components of the uClinux distribution are, of course, the kernel
itself, the uClibc library and BusyBox. The uClinux kernel
has support for MMU-less CPUs, but this feature is of minor importance
nowadays. Because the cost of adding the MMU is so small, I expect that
most, if not all, embedded CPUs used on an RG will have it. Nevertheless,
uClinux is a great distribution, even if you don't exploit the MMU-less
CPU support. The same goes for uClibc. It originally was created
to support MMU-less systems, which, for instance, cannot have a fork(2)
system call. But, even if you don't need this functionality, it is a great
alternative for glibc on embedded systems, as glibc has much larger
RAM requirements. BusyBox is a collection of standard UNIX utilities,
optimized for embedded systems with low RAM. It comes with uClinux, and
as with uClibc, you usually will prefer it over full-featured standard
utilities, unless you have a system with enough RAM (typically above 16MB).
</p><p>
You need two important pieces of software that are not a part of
uClinux. The first piece is a bootloader, which is software that usually resides in
ROM (at least partially) and is responsible for loading the Linux image from
Flash to RAM and performing some hardware initializations. Unfortunately, there is
no standard bootloader for uClinux. In fact, there are no standards for
bootloaders in the embedded world, and you cannot use PC bootloaders, such
as GRUB or LILO. Your hardware manufacturer almost certainly will provide a
bootloader, and I strongly suggest using it. If it does not support Linux,
it usually is easier to adopt it than to port a different bootloader
to your hardware. If you still choose to port the bootloader, Das U-Boot
is
a good choice, as are many others. 
</p><p>
The second missing piece is a Web-based
graphical user interface (GUI), which most users come to expect from
RGs. Most, if not all, currently available RGs have a Web interface written
from scratch. However, it does not have to be like this anymore with the introduction
of the X-Wrt Project, one of the components of the OpenWrt Project, which
you almost certainly will want to look at if you are building an RG. OpenWrt
is a Linux distribution for the Linksys WRT routers (and not only those).
</p><p>
Add to this a bit of init script writing, and you are done, except for
the peripheral (802.11, ADSL and so on) drivers, which is a topic for a
another article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb8d98"></a>
Hardware</h2></div></div><p>
Now to the real fun&mdash;choosing (or even better, designing) your
hardware. MIPS
is the most commonly used CPU architecture in these kinds of devices,
with older devices using the MIPS32 4K cores, and newer devices
probably using the MIPS32 24K cores. As MIPS 24K is about 3%
slower than MIPS 4K at the same clock rate (because of the longer
pipeline), it makes sense to use it only if you really need clock rates
of about 400MHz. However, benchmarks show that networking devices are
memory- and I/O-bound, not CPU-bound (after all, there is
not much number crunching in forwarding packets, with a few exceptions
discussed later), so you probably will need these high clock rates
only if you are going to use DDR RAM and not SDRAM (which is limited to
133MHz). 
</p><p>
Another option is the new (at least in the embedded world)
multithreading (MT) technology of the MIPS32 34K, which can have
a configurable number of Virtual Processing Elements (VPEs) and Thread
Contexts (TCs). Without going into too much detail, this technology is a
more flexible equivalent of Intel Hyper-Threading, which helps the CPU
exploit parallelism at the process and thread level (compared to parallelism
at the instruction level, which superscalar processors can exploit quite
well). This can boost performance in some cases, especially when there
are a few concurrent processes or threads that are I/O- or memory-bound,
but benchmarks show that this may not always be the case. In addition,
MT has an overhead&mdash;MIPS 34K is slightly slower than MIPS 24K at the
same clock rate, and the Linux kernel becomes slightly slower when compiled
with symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) enabled.
</p><p>
Another CPU you probably should consider is MIPS' closest
competitor&mdash;ARM. It is used less frequently than MIPS for these particular devices,
mostly for historical reasons. ARM7 is very popular, small and
has a low power core; however, it is clearly too slow for an RG. If you decide
to go with ARM, you should consider one of the ARM9 or ARM10
families of processors, with the major differences, as far as an RG application
is concerned, being performance, power consumption and cost.
</p><p>
RAM and Flash choice is obvious; you need at least 8MB of RAM and
2MB of Flash. However, as memory prices are dropping, I expect that future
devices will have 64MB of RAM and 4MB of Flash. For the same reason,
you probably will have to go with DDR and not SDRAM&mdash;as SDRAM
actually becomes
more expensive than DDR.
</p><p>
Assuming you are going to use one of the reference design boards
provided by a manufacturer (board design is beyond the scope of this
article anyway), you are ready to test your brand-new RG. Unfortunately,
you are in for a big surprise. Your CPU is going to choke at not so
unreasonable bandwidths.
</p><p>
One possible solution is to use a more powerful (and significantly
more expensive) CPU, such as the Intel IXP or Freescale PowerQUICC network
processors. For instance, the 533MHz IXP425 will have no problem sustaining
that kind of traffic. Unfortunately, in order to stay competitive, RG
manufacturers cannot afford these high-end processors, so a more creative
solution is required.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb9058"></a>
Optimization</h2></div></div><p>
This is the challenge of next-generation RGs&mdash;achieve high throughput
using low-end hardware. One possible solution is to offload the whole data path
of the RG to hardware, the way it works on high-end core routers, which usually
employ a general-purpose CPU only for management and control. There are
a few chips that can do this for the low-end RG market, such as the Realtek
RTL8650B/RTL8651B, which can do routing, NAT and firewall in hardware. Of
course,
the implementation is limited compared to the Linux TCP/IP stack, but the
hardware can be configured to trap the CPU in case it encounters a packet it
cannot handle, so that most of the packets will be forwarded from one
interface to another without interrupting the CPU. However, this approach
has a number of problems, the most serious one being the fact that
the hardware TCP/IP stack is limited to a fixed interface (MII in case of
RTL8650).
It would be difficult and, in some cases, impossible, to connect other
interfaces, such as 802.11, DOCSIS and xDSL, to that logic. Therefore,
I believe that although this approach can work in some specific cases, it is a
wrong idea in general.
</p><p>
Typically, it is a good idea to keep to the software as much as possible, because
it's easier to develop and debug. Another optimization approach is based
on the observation that RGs (and networking applications in general)
are memory-bound, so it would be extremely beneficial to improve memory
access. Let's separate data and code for the sake of this discussion. As
far as the code is concerned, we want to keep it in cache as much
as possible. Ideally, we want the whole critical path
routines&mdash;that is, starting from one driver's receive function via
the TCP/IP stack and to
the other driver's send function to stay in cache all the time. This is
not possible with most embedded processors, which have only a 32K cache.
However, it can be shown that the Linux 2.6 critical path&mdash;that is, functions used
95% of the time, under firewall and NAT configuration, including Ethernet
drivers' send and receive routines, can fit into a 64K cache, and there are
embedded processors with 64K on the market. If your CPU does not have
that much cache, but instead has scratchpad SRAM, you can modify the Linux
linker script to place certain routines in the SRAM memory region.
</p><p>
If you want to test the above observation (or calculate how much
cache your particular application needs), use OProfile, which
is a system-wide profiler for Linux that allows you to profile user-mode
applications, kernel and drivers, and supports many embedded architectures
along with objdump (or any other utility) that will show you how much
memory each routine requires.
</p><p>
As for the data, it is absolutely necessary to ensure that all network
drivers follow zero-copy methodology, and it may be wise to place
frequently accessed data structures in a scratchpad SRAM.
</p><p>
Yet another optimization approach is the mixture of the above
two&mdash;using profiler, find the most CPU-intensive pieces of code and offload
this particular functionality to the hardware. As it turns out, the two
most CPU-intensive tasks related to networking are IPSec and the UDP/TCP checksum
calculation. It is very convenient (and not very surprising) that
both have a well-defined architecture for hardware offloading. UDP and TCP
checksum offloading is extremely beneficial, because if it is checked in
the hardware on receive and calculated in the hardware on transmit, the CPU will never have
to bring the whole packet into the cache, significantly reducing the
number of memory accesses. IPSec, on the other hand, is less useful, as
an RG is rarely an IPSec termination point&mdash;usually IPSec (VPN) traffic
is passed through and terminated on the PC.
</p><p>
Another approach that I definitely do not recommend, but one being
taken by some manufacturers because it is actually cheaper than the
ones mentioned above, is to &ldquo;optimize&rdquo; Linux by creating
various types of &ldquo;fast
paths&rdquo;. For instance, if the L2 bridge performance is not satisfactory,
it is possible to pass packets from one network driver directly to the
other, eliminating at least one context switch and some other code,
resulting in performance gain. Although it will not work in general
cases, it does work for an RG, where the manufacturer controls the whole
system, including all the drivers and the kernel itself. The biggest
problem with this approach is that it actually cripples the stock Linux
kernel, limiting functionality and introducing bugs. These modifications
rarely are submitted to the Linux-kernel mailing list, and even if
they were, they never would be accepted. But, they do go into some products
you can find in stores.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xdc0580.0xeb9420"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Using the steps described above, you should be able to build a Linux-based
RG with relatively little effort. If performance becomes an issue, which
almost certainly will be the case if you cannot use high-end processors,
follow the optimizations guidelines outlined above. And, it's
always a good idea to run a profiler on your particular system to discover
additional bottlenecks.
</p><p>
Although this article discusses RGs, most of the conclusions and
guidelines are true for any embedded networking system.
</p><p>
The issue of Linux optimization for RG systems actually leads to a much
bigger and more controversial topic. There seems to be a significant
communication problem between the Open Source community and embedded
developers working for commercial companies. On one hand, features added
to the kernel sometimes hurt performance on small embedded systems. On
the other hand, Linux improvements done by some companies do not always find
their way back to the main kernel tree, often because they are not done
properly. One good example of this miscommunication is the 2.6 kernel
itself, which included many important improvements for embedded systems,
but suffered some performance degradation. As a result, a significant
number of embedded systems still run the 2.4 kernel. The reason for this
miscommunication is probably the fact that semiconductor companies that
usually do embedded software development find it hard to embrace the idea of
open source, but it also may be due to the fact that the Open Source community is
less interested in embedded systems, because they are harder to hack than a PC. I
do believe that the first problem eventually will go away, as semiconductor
companies understand how they can benefit from open source, and I try
to do my share of explaining wherever I can. As for the second problem,
one of the messages of this article is that it's easy and pretty
cool to hack embedded systems, and you actually may have the
hardware already.
