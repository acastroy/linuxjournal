The coolest Linux and open-source applications may be ones you
already have.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a5580.0x119d3f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
How can our main server be out of disk space, Fran&ccedil;ois? Last week, we
had enough disk left to last us into the next decade. What happened? No,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>mon ami</em></span>, I am not accusing you of anything. I'm just
curious if
you, perhaps, might have an idea. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Quoi?</em></span> You were
downloading
a few packages for the cool apps issue? Let me see. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon
Dieu!</em></span>
There are thousands of source packages here! I know you were trying to
help, Fran&ccedil;ois, but you didn't need to download every application on
SourceForge. I see some ISO images here as well. I guess you wanted to
find out which was the coolest. How many did you get? All of them!
Sigh...we'll talk about this later. For now, we need to get ready for
our guests' arrival. They will be here any moment.
</p><p>
Too late, Fran&ccedil;ois. Look sharp! Welcome everyone, to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez
Marcel</em></span>, home to exquisite Linux and open-source software
served with
the finest wines and enjoyed by the greatest of clientele. Your tables
are waiting. Please, make yourselves comfortable, and my faithful waiter,
Fran&ccedil;ois, will fetch the wine. To the cellar, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mon
ami</em></span>. I think the
2002 Vinedos de las Vientos Tannat will surprise many of our guests. The
Tannat grape is a varietal from Uruguay, and as such, it's unusual for
many
palates. Drink and enjoy!
</p><p>
While we await the wine, let's look at tonight's menu of cool
applications. Contrary to Fran&ccedil;ois' well-meaning efforts, you don't need
to spend hours scouring the Internet looking for the coolest software.
All
you need to do is spend a little time exploring the applications you
already have, and you'll discover wonders you didn't know existed,
right there in front of you. Speaking of my faithful waiter, here he
is. Fran&ccedil;ois, please pour the wine for our guests. While you enjoy that
first sip, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, allow me to reintroduce you to
a program you
already may be using.
</p><p>
One of my favorite photo management applications and one of the
finest available, is digiKam. digiKam is a complete digital photo
management system. Using digiKam, you can create collections and organize
your photos (by date, type and more) in easily searchable albums
(Figure 1). Selecting and downloading images from your camera is
easy and fun. You can add comments to pictures, adjust light levels,
fix red-eye and more. It basically has everything you would expect
from a photo management suite, plus a few additional options that make
it a contender for the coolness crown.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9741f1.large.jpg"><img src="9741f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. digiKam
is a superb digital photo management suite with features you probably
hadn't imagined.
</p></div></div><p>
As you can see from Figure 1, digiKam automatically organizes
your photos by date, but there are other clever ways of organizing them.
One way is
to create named tags. For instance, say you had a couple hundred travel
pictures, of which 30 or so are from Rome. You could assign all vacation
pictures a Travel tag and further tag those Rome pictures with the word
Rome. Next time you want to hunt down the shots of your Roman holiday,
simply click the Rome tag. If one of those images looks like something
you want to share with a friend, select the image, click Image on the
menu bar, select Email Images, and a dialog appears that lets you
add more images to an e-mail message or just send out the one you chose.
</p><p>
There's a problem with having a lot of images though. Okay, there may be
more than one problem, but if you are like me, you have a tendency to
copy your
photos more than once. digiKam has a cool feature that lets you locate
duplicate images. Simply click Tools on the menu bar, and select Find
Duplicate Images. 
</p><p>
Speaking of multiple images, wouldn't it be cool to
create an MPEG slideshow&mdash;a movie of your photos? Yes, indeed,
digiKam
does that too. Select a group of images, click Tools on the menu bar,
and select Create MPEG Slideshow. A window appears (Figure 2)
from which you can choose the amount of time a picture is displayed, a
fade time (if you want one), the video output format and more. You
also can organize the order in which the pictures are displayed by moving
them up or down in the list.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9741f2.large.jpg"><img src="9741f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. digiKam
makes it easy to create a movie from your digital photos.
</p></div></div><p>
You can do many exciting things with digiKam, which I will let you
explore on your own (look under the Image and Tools menu for a start),
but before we move on, I do want to share one more cool feature. It's
not unusual, at Christmas time, to share cards with pictures of
the family. Using digiKam, you can go one step further. How about a
calendar for the coming year with great color pictures selected from
your collection?
</p><p>
To create a calendar with digiKam, click Tools, then Select
Calendar. At this time, the Create Calendar dialog appears
(Figure 3) from which you can create a personalized calendar in only a
few steps. To begin, choose a paper size (US or A4) and the location of
the image on the page. The latter selection also defines the orientation
of the
page. At this point, you also can choose a font and decide whether you
want lines surrounding the calendar dates.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9741f3.large.jpg"><img src="9741f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. Create
a custom calendar using your own digital photos.
</p></div></div><p>
Click Next to continue on to the photo selection screen (Figure
4). This is where the real fun takes place. You've got 12 months
and 12 possible images for your calendar. I suggested family photos
earlier,
but you could use anything. Instead of buying a calendar of artwork
or travel photos, how about creating your own? Those Roman ruins would
probably make a nice addition to your office wall. Click on each month
to add images, or drag them from digiKam onto the month icons. To clear
an icon and select a different picture, right-click the month. When
you have chosen something for all 12 months, click Next. The final
screen displays a status as each page is generated and an overview
of the total. When the job is done, click Finish to close the dialog.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9741f4.large.jpg"><img src="9741f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Half
the fun of creating your own calendar is deciding what pictures will
represent each month.
</p></div></div><p>
Another favorite application of mine is the amazing Amarok, an
impressive multimedia player with a host of cool features that makes it
one of the best multimedia players, regardless of operating
system. Sadly
for a few of your friends, you can't get Amarok on the Redmond OS, but
because you run Linux, that's not a problem. When you are hard at work
in front of the computer, it's nice to listen to some of your favorite
tunes. Depending on where you work, you may even have the luxury of
singing along with the music. But what if you don't know the words?
</p><p>
Click the Lyrics tab. If this is the first time you've looked at this
feature, odds are the script manager won't yet be running. Click the Run
Script Manager button to bring up the Script Manager. You
don't need to be listening to a song to do this. At any time, you can
click Tools on the menu bar and select Script Manager from there. When
the Script Manager window appears (Figure 5), you'll see a list of
scripts, categorized on the left. Clicking the plus sign beside each
category opens the list.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9741f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Amarok's feature set can
be extended with scripts.
</p></div></div><p>
I invite you to highlight a script and click the About button to
discover what each one does. You also can click the Get More Scripts
button to
discover additional extensions and scripts for Amarok. You'll find screensavers based on your current music, voting scripts, scripts that print
album covers and playlists and more. And, of course, there are lyric
scripts. One
already comes with Amarok, but it isn't necessarily turned on. Click
on Lyrc (under Lyrics), and then click the Run button. This activates a
script that queries the lyric server at <a href="http://lyrc.com.ar" target="_self">lyrc.com.ar</a>. Then,
while listening to your music, you can click the Lyric tab, and Amarok
displays the words to the song, turning you into a diva (or divo).
</p><p>
Sometimes, you need to take your music with you. Music devices,
such as iPods, are supported using a plugin architecture. What are
these plugins? The popular iPod is supported, as are iRiver, Creative
Nomad and several other generic audio devices. Depending on your player,
you may find that it works with a plugin other than the one you expect,
so keep trying. For instance, I have an iRiver T10, which works using the
MTP Media Device plugin. All this is to say that if your particular player
isn't listed or doesn't work immediately, don't give up; try one of
the other plugins first.
</p><p>
To use a player with Amarok, click Tools&rarr;Configure Amarok. When
the configuration window appears (Figure 6), look at the left-hand
sidebar, and select Media Devices. If you haven't done so,
make sure your music player (iPod, iRiver or whatever) is already
connected and
powered on. Depending on the type of MP3 player you are connecting,
Amarok already may have detected the device, in which case you'll see
the device identified at the top of the configuration window with the
Plugin already chosen for you.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="9741f6.large.jpg"><img src="9741f6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. Amarok
should be able to detect your music player, but if it doesn't, it's easy
to add it manually.
</p></div></div><p>
If your player hasn't been detected, you can add a device
manually by clicking the Add Device button. From the pop-up window that
appears,
select a plugin, provide your new device with a name (whatever you like),
then identify its mountpoint on the system (for example, /mnt/ipod).
Click
Apply to close the window and return to Amarok. Now, to put music on your
player, click the Devices tab on the far left. You should see your player
listed at the top of the left-hand pane. Directly above the device name
is a button labeled Connect. Make sure your device is connected through
its USB cable, and click Connect.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x10a5580.0x119e840"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Note:</b></p><p>
Some older players use memory cards to
store music in the same way that digital cameras do. You still
can use these with Amarok by creating a generic device with a defined
mountpoint, such as /mnt/mp3player.
</p></div><p>
If you already have tracks loaded on your music player, they will
appear in Amarok's left-hand pane, sorted by artist. Incidentally, you
can
use this list to delete songs from the player by right-clicking on a
track
and selecting Delete from device. On the other hand, if your player is
empty, you'll be looking at a plain window, waiting to be populated. To
add songs, simply drag them from your Amarok playlist (the main window to
the left) into the device window. Once you do, a Transfer Queue
appears in the lower half of the media browser window on the left. At the
very bottom of the media browser, you'll see a graphical bar showing
the amount of storage space on your player, the amount available
and the space in your transfer queue (Figure 7). When you are happy
with the playlist in your transfer queue, click the Transfer button at
the top of the media browser window. A progress bar appears at the
lower left, updating as each track is copied to your player.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="9741f7.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. Add your tracks, but keep an eye on the available space.
</p></div></div><p>
That's it. You're ready to take your music with you. Monsieur
Shakespeare said that music was the food of love. Now all you need is
a little more wine.
</p><p>
I wish I could spend more time showing you the wild and unusual side
of what you may have come to think of as ordinary, but the hour grows
late. Did you know that K3b, your CD/DVD burning application also
is a great tool for ripping audio tracks from your CDs? Simply click
Tools
and select Rip Audio CD. You also can rip a video DVD&mdash;click Tools
and select Rip Video DVD. 
</p><p>
Then there's Konqueror, the all-around file
manager, Web browser combination. When using it as a file manager, you
can split the screen left and right by pressing Shift-Ctrl-L. Pressing
Shift-Ctrl-T
splits the screen vertically. Select a location in each screen (including
remote FTP or secure copy connections), then simply drag and drop from
one
window to the next. You even can split the already-split windows.
</p><p>
Konsole,
your KDE terminal application, can transform to a transparent Konsole,
allowing your desktop artwork to shine through. Click
Settings&rarr;Schema,
and then select Transparent Konsole (or one of the many other looks).
</p><p>
As you can see, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes amis</em></span>, although it's tempting
(and exciting,
as temptation can be) always to be on the lookout for the latest,
greatest and coolest applications, your search need not always be a
long one. Sometimes the coolest applications really are the ones you
already use. You just need to spend a little time getting to know them better. Uncover their secrets and your existing friendship
could turn into something beautiful. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Mon Dieu</em></span>, I
think my mind may
be wandering to places other than software. If so, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>,
surely we can blame the wine. Fran&ccedil;ois, please, refill
our guests' glasses a final time. Raise your glasses, <span   class="emphasis"><em>mes
amis</em></span>,
and let us all drink to one another's health.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>A votre sant&eacute;! Bon app&eacute;tit!</em></span>
