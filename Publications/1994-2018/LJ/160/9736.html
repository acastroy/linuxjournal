Break down the knowledge barriers with demotic character,

We were flying from the Coliseum north above Figueroa into downtown Los
Angeles, about five stories above the road surface. After crossing the
Harbor Freeway, we passed the Bob Hope Patriotic Hall on our right, then
barely cleared ten lanes of elevated traffic on the Santa Monica
Freeway. After zooming past the Convention Center and the Staples
Center, we veered to avoid hitting a large building facing south across
Olympic that featured monstrous portraits of Kobe Bryant and two other
Lakers. From here north, the street became a slot between rows of
buildings on both sides. When a break showed up at 5th, we took a hard
right to head east a couple blocks before taking another right on Hill.
Below to our right appeared Pershing Square. Suddenly, we dove down to
the ground and into the escalators leading down into the subway. Here we
paused on the platform to watch a train go by, then punched out through
the roof and into the air above, where we took Hill North to a right on
4th and then across Broadway and through the arched doorway into the
Bradbury Building, a hollow shrine to ironwork and exposed elevator
mechanics, best known for the noir scenes it provided for the movies
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Blade Runner</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Chinatown</em></span>. From
here, we flew out to the north and then
east on Cesar Chavez to look at plans for turning the concrete trough
of the Los Angeles River into a green park of some kind. Suddenly, the
park itself appeared, the river blue to the brim.

Our pilot and urban simulation god was Zachary Rynew, a grad student in
Architecture at UCLA. The flight was a demonstration of Virtual Los
Angeles, a
simulacrum of downtown LA. One can fly through and explore Virtual LA
in surreal time&mdash;that is, right now or at times in the past or
future.
Virtual LA is designed to facilitate urban planning, emergency
response, architectural development, education and a mess of other
specialties and combinations thereof. It combines 3-D geometric modeling
with street-level and aerial photography. Some of the visuals are so
detailed, you can read graffiti and small signs in shop windows. The
system originally was developed on SGI systems, but it was moved to Linux
several years ago. Like all open-source projects, and like the subject
it explores, it is under development. Work will continue on it as long
as the project is useful.
</p><p>
Virtual Los Angeles was one among many visualizations at the Digital
Innovation Day Showcase at UCLA in
May 2007. Others included the Roman Forum Project,
800 Years of Berlin
and the Qumran Visualization Project.
In UCLA's Visualization Portal, we were treated to a tour
of Santiago de Compostela, a
13th-century cathedral in Spain, as three projectors blended images
seamlessly on a curved 180&deg; screen surrounding seating for 40.
In each case, the experts talked about how the work of virtual
construction (or reconstruction) resulted in better insights and
understandings of settings both long gone and not yet built. There was a
constant digital dance between analysis and synthesis&mdash;and in the
midst of it all, the increasingly obvious need for tools that are open
and free.
</p><p>
All this work grew alongside and out of a relatively new discipline
called digital humanities. I had first heard of
the field from Joseph Vaughan, Assistant Director of the UCLA Center for
Digital Humanities, in an e-mail responding to a Linux for Suits report
on the first Desktop Linux Summit, back in 2003. In that e-mail, Joe
reported on gradual progress in getting more Linux and open-source
software put to use on digital humanities projects. I ran into Joe at
the showcase, and he said that, in fact, a lot of progress had been made
during the four years since he sent that e-mail, with much more to go. The
same could be said of digital humanities, and for that matter, of all
digital technologies.
</p><p>
This was one of the first points made by the keynote speaker, Dr
Willard McCarty of the Centre
for Computing in the Humanities, Kings College
London. Dr McCarty's talk was titled
&ldquo;What's going
on?&rdquo;, and he began by telling us that what's happening in computing is
by nature perpetually protean. &ldquo;In the history of
inventions&rdquo;, he said,
&ldquo;computing is in its infancy, its products incunabular. The point I am
making is that it and they always will be, however progressively better
they get.&rdquo;
</p><p>
But, he does note some trends:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
About 30 years ago, Northrop Frye noted a striking technological
change in scholarly resources, from the &ldquo;portly...tomes&rdquo; of his
childhood, communicating in their physical stature &ldquo;immense and
definitive authority&rdquo;, to the &ldquo;paperback revolution&rdquo; of his
adulthood, which better matched the speed of scholarship and gave
wing to the diversification of publishing. The demotic character and
relative impermanence communicated by these paperbacks also implied
the undermining of authority I just mentioned, in this case a
weakening of the barrier between author and reader. Running in
parallel if not cognate with this physically mediated change came
theoretical changes in ideas of textuality, for example, Mikhail
Bakhtin's &ldquo;dialogic imagination&rdquo;, reader-response theory and, more
recently, in anthropological linguistic studies of context.
Meanwhile, various parts of computer science have developed
congruently, from design of black-boxed, batch-orientated systems of
former times to toolkits and implementations of &ldquo;interaction
design&rdquo;. Computing has become literally and figuratively conversational.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
This applies not only to the rise of independent and autonomous
development by individuals and groups, but also to participation by everybody
willing and able to weigh in, including users, which McCarty places now
at the start rather than at the end of things:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
...it makes less and less sense to be thinking in terms of
&ldquo;end users&rdquo; and to be creating knowledge-jukeboxes for them. It
makes more and more sense to be designing for &ldquo;end makers&rdquo; and
giving them the scholarly equivalent of Tinker Toys. But, we must
beware not to be taking away with one hand what we have given with
the other. To use Clifford Geertz' vivid phrase, we need rigorous
&ldquo;intellectual weed control&rdquo; against the Taylorian notions that keep
users in their place&mdash;notions of knowledge &ldquo;delivery&rdquo;, scholarly
&ldquo;impact&rdquo;, learning &ldquo;outcomes&rdquo; and all the rest of the tiresome cant
we are submerged in these days. The whole promise of computing for
our time&mdash;here is my historical thesis&mdash;is directly contrary to
the obsolete 19th-century cosmology implicit in such talk.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
McCarty's proximal context is the academy, particularly the graduate
schools and programs where specialties tend to be well-tended and
guarded spaces. About these, he says:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Particularly since the advent of the Web, our attention and energy
have been involved with the exponential growth of digitization. The
benefits for scholarship here are unarguably great. But as ever
larger amounts of searchable and otherwise computable material
become available, we don't simply have more evidence for this or
that business as usual. We have massively greater ecological
diversity to take account of, and so can expect inherited ways of
construing reality and of working, alone and with each other, to
need basic renovation. Here is work to be done. It's not a matter of
breaking down disciplinary boundaries&mdash;the more we concentrate on
breaking these down, the more they are needed for the breaking down.
Rather the point is the reconfiguration of disciplinarity. From
computing's prospect at least, the feudal metaphor of turf and the
medieval tree of knowledge in its formal garden of learning make no
sense. We need other metaphors. Here is work to be done.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
The challenge McCarty lays out over and over, with those four
words&mdash;&ldquo;work to be done&rdquo;&mdash;is not just for academics alone, or academics in
cahoots with programmers and other technologists. It's work to be done
by everybody.
</p><p>
This comes home for me with ProjectVRM, which
I'm heading up as a fellow with the Berkman Center for Internet and
Society at Harvard
University. Here, I'm
working to drive development of tools that fix marketplaces by giving
customers both independence from vendor entrapments and better ways of
engaging with vendors on an equal power footing. These tools of
independence and engagement don't exist yet&mdash;though their parts surely
do, amid the growing portfolio of free and open-source software and
standards that are lying around in the world.
</p><p>
The problem is, the only code I know is Morse. A few years ago, that
would have disqualified me as a project leader. Now, it doesn't. Because
now, it's easier than ever for people who see problems worth solving to
find the people and tools that will help those problems get solved.
That's what's happening with ProjectVRM. It's what happened with the
user-centric identity movement out of which VRM grew as a specialty. And,
it's what will lead Linux and other open-source projects off of their
own turf and out into a larger world where users are at the start of
things, and not just the end.
