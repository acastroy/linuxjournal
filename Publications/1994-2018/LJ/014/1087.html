    Mark Bolzern talks about a recent trip spent promoting Linux
    and Flagship, the product he sells for Linux and other
    Unix-like systems.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x29c6580.0x2abe240"></a></h2></div></div><p>Mark Bolzern is the President of
WorkGroup Solutions, Inc, a company selling the FlagShip CA-Clipper
language product, and is also a board member of Linux
International. When we heard that he was taking a tour promoting
Linux, we asked him to share that experience with our readers.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: I understand that you
just completed a tour to promote Linux and FlagShip. Where did you
go?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mark</b></span>: I started with the
CA-Clipper Users' group in Detroit. I then went to Boston and met
with magazine editors out there, including Byte, Information Week,
and a few others. I also met with several well-known industry
analysts while I was there. My next stop was Cleveland for a
presentation to the Greater Cleveland Clipper Users' group. Then I
went to Chicago and spent time educating our PR firm on Linux. The
last leg included presentations to Clipper users' groups in St.
Louis, Jefferson City, and Kansas City. The whole trip took about 3
weeks. I drove my van rather than attempting to fly, because of the
equipment I had with me, and because the plane schedules were such
that it would have been a lot more hassle to fly.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Were these normal users'
meetings that you attended, or did you do anything special to bring
in other users?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mark</b></span>: I had my PR firm put
on radio spots and local newspaper and magazine ads. These drew
additional people in. Mailings were also done.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: How many people did you
introduce Linux to on this tour?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mark</b></span>: Hundreds of people saw
Linux for the first time, were impressed, and then mobbed me with
questions. I purposely did not sell any Linux CDs on this tour, but
I gave away quite a few as door prizes. In fact, here is a quote
from Mark Schumann, President of the Cleveland group. He e-mailed
it to me after I left.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It was nice having you around Cleveland this
week. I have to say, Mark, that this is the first GCPCUG Clipper
meeting in many months that generated as much excitement among
attendees. We've had better attendance at times, and also much
worse, but not often do people come and watch and think and mob the
speaker as they did this week. Nice going!</p></blockquote></div><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: What did your
presentation to these groups consist of?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mark</b></span>: I had a Pentium 90
running WGS Linux Pro and a big monitor with me. I showed them
DOOM, fvwm, Workman playing music from CD, and lots of other things
going simultaneously. I also compiled FlagShip programs at the same
time and showed off some converted Clipper programs. I waxed
eloquent on how Linux is &ldquo;Unix: The Next Generation&rdquo;, and why Linux
and whatever Microsoft does may be the only operating systems
within 5-10 years. I presented a history of the computer industry
and the role Unix has played. I also drew analogies to other events
in human history that happened for the same reasons that Linux is
going to. If you think Linux is something now, &ldquo;you ain't seen
nuthin' yet!&rdquo; True revolutions have always had to sneak in through
the back door. Heck, that is exactly how PCs and PC LANs got to
where they are now. The established powers virtually never see the
revolution till it is too late. Look what IBM's own problem child,
the PC, did to them! From #1 in computers &amp; mainframes to being
a &ldquo;me too&rdquo; clone company, all because they never really understood
it. When I worked for IBM, I asked if I could work with the PC
shortly after it came out. I recognized the PC as a revolution in
the making. IBM told me the PC would never be a mainstream product.
They said if I wanted to work with it, I'd have to transfer to
Computerland or IBM's factory in Boca Raton. I quit and went to
Computerland.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: What is your &ldquo;WGS Linux
Pro&rdquo;?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mark</b></span>: It is a CD containing
the Slackware Linux distribution, along with a number of additional
things drawn from the Internet. WGS is specifically targeting the
commercial market that present Linux vendors have had difficulty
moving into. We provide quality and assurance, not necessarily the
latest code. We do not feel that we compete with the InfoMagics,
Slackware Pros, and Yggdrasils of the world. We are after people
who develop commercial software for commercial use. These are the
people who want FlagShip. In the meantime, our PR benefits the
entire Linux community. I would wager that all CD-ROM vendors have
sold more CDs since we started our activities, partially due to
these very activities. I would like for all CD-ROM vendors to have
our FlagShip Test Drives and information on their CDs.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: What is CA-Clipper, and
what did you present specifically to its users on this tour? How
many Clipper users are there?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mark</b></span>: There are over 200,000
CA- Clipper users and programmers in the US alone. If you add the
similar Fox and dBase products, there are well over 10 million.
Clipper is a very popular applications development language
worldwide; in fact, it is even more popular outside the US than
inside. Just as Cobol is the legacy language to mainframes,
CA-Clipper is the legacy language for business applications on the
PC. There are millions of business software packages written in it.
But Clipper is far more than just a legacy language, it is still a
concept leader. Clipper started as a way to compile dBase III
programs and then began to add features and functions. When Clipper
5 was released, it was the first seriously object-oriented language
for creating business applications. It is now one of the very best
languages for developing character-based data-oriented
applications. It allows fast prototyping, simultaneously creating
robust and easy to maintain code. The programs created can be
distributed completely royalty free and with no runtime module
necessary. There is a large community of developers of add-on tools
and products for Clipper&mdash;as many vendors as probably for any other
development tool. There is much more information I could pass on,
but people can feel free to check out our FTP site for further
information, URL ftp://ftp.wgs.com/pub2/wgs/Filelist, or write
<a href="mailto:info@wgs.com">info@wgs.com</a>. They could
also pose questions on the alt.comp.databases.xbase.clipper Usenet
forum or the CompuServe Clipper Forum, or call Computer Associates
(CA) for information on Clipper.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: FlagShip is CA-Clipper
for Unix?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mark</b></span>: Yes, call CA and
mention Clipper and Unix in the same sentence. They will send you
to WGS. When people mention a DOS version of FlagShip to us, we
first try to sell them Linux and, if it doesn't work, we send them
to CA for Clipper. So, in summary, FlagShip is an implementation of
CA-Clipper for Unix and there is a Linux version of FlagShip at
DOS-level pricing. CA-Clipper has been the dominant language for
writing and distributing business applications on DOS, so that
means Linux and commercial applications usage could merge at light
speed! Millions of applications, no muss, no fuss. Lack of a good,
inexpensive, royalty-free business applications language and its
resulting applications has held the use of Unix back seriously in
most businesses. And products like Oracle, Informix, Sybase etc.
are far too expensive. [Read the review of FlagShip and dBMAN in
this issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>&mdash;ED]</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Why do you call Linux
&ldquo;Unix: The Next Generation&rdquo;?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mark</b></span>: I explained that a bit
in my editorial last month, A new project or a GNU project? You can
look at it this way. Unix is very modular, with the basic concepts
being standard in, standard out, and standard error. These are the
interfaces used to build a modular operating system in good
building block, Lego style. So it is possible, even easy, to
replace pieces of Unix as needed. The GNU project of the Free
Software Foundation has been around a long time. It is mostly made
up of enhanced and bug-fixed replacement utilities for Unix. Over
the years, a lot of Unix manufacturers have shipped a lot of broken
things, and this simultaneously made the GNU project necessary and
possible. As a result, when the Linux Kernel came along, most of
the Next Generation Unix was already waiting. Voil&aacute;, what we
know as Linux. Linux is not new; only the kernel, the assemblage
and the name are new. Linux is the result of a generation of bug
fixes and enhancements by many very astute technical people, not
the least of whom is Linus Torvalds. There is another way to look
at it, too. The Internet was built primarily on Unix systems and
various utilities that were added to Unix such as TCP/IP. Linux was
built largely on the Internet, a child of the Internet, if you
please. So Unix, and the Internet are parents of Linux&mdash;&ldquo;Unix: The
Next Generation&rdquo;.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: I noticed that you said
earlier that you think Linux may be one of only two operating
systems within 5-10 years. Why do you think that?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Mark</b></span>: Hardware manufacturers
used to compete with one another by getting the job done better for
customers and by trying to create more powerful systems. Then they
started doing operating systems software, programming languages,
and applications software. Soon language vendors and applications
software companies were born because no one manufacturer could do
it all. Unix has now been adopted by almost all manufacturers
because their own proprietary OS development cannot keep up. The
bigger the manufacturer, the longer it took them to come around.
The natural next step is for the OS to become totally independent
of hardware manufacturers. There are 4 choices: Unix, Linux, OS/2,
and whatever Microsoft does. I list Linux separately because it
carries the spirit of Unix forward better than any other
implementation. Of the options, Linux actually has the most
development resources and a cooperative development environment. In
addition, all companies and people have equal access to Linux.
Microsoft has more money than the Linux people do, but anytime
people are hired for pay and position, rather than for the love of
it, there end up being many distracting political hassles. Most
Linux people are in it because it is art to them. Neither UnixWare
nor OS/2 have these advantages, and as such, are behind. POSIX is a
committee standard and Linux may become its best implementation in
all respects very soon. DEC's interest with Alpha machines is a
good example of this. I think that as Linux gets more capable,
stable, user friendly, easy to install, and has applications
available, it may actually take over as the primary OS for all
hardware manufacturers, specifically because of its independence.
It may become the primary target platform for all applications
developers that do not want to compete with Microsoft on
Microsoft's own turf (OS). Linux should not be called a
<span   class="bold"><b>free</b></span> operating system, it should
be called a <span   class="bold"><b>priceless</b></span> operating
system.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b><i>LJ</i></b></span>: Thank you very much for
