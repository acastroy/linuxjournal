    By the time you have reached this page, you may have noticed

    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x115c580.0x12541e8"></a></h2></div></div><p>By the time you have reached this page,
you may have noticed some changes in the appearance of
<i  >Linux Journal</i>. The changes are more than skin
deep and, in this column, I will let you know what is happening.
</p><p>The changes have come about both in response to reader
feedback and in our attempt to streamline production of the
magazine. Up through issue 11, layout was done on a contract basis
by an outside person. This interface, both because of the physical
location of layout being in a different place than the rest of
magazine production and because there was a Macintosh involved,
took more time and effort than was practical. With issue 12 we
started to move layout in-house and, after a false start or two, we
are happy to say all is under control.</p><p>Our new layout person is Amy Wood. She has previously worked
for a weekly newspaper and the biggest problem we have with her is
convincing her that she has a whole month between magazines instead
of a week. The layout itself is still done in Quark XPress but it
now runs on an MS-Windows system which is connected to our Linux
network. The actual interface is handled by Samba (see <i  >LJ</i> issue 7
for more info on Samba) and is transparent to Amy. For the rest of
us, it means that files can be sent to and from that system without
the need for <span   class="emphasis"><em>sneaker-net</em></span>. (In a future issue
we will have an article on how <i  >Linux Journal</i>
is produced using mostly Linux systems.)</p><p>Because Amy had so much extra time after finishing up issue
13 she looked at the assorted comments about our layout and along
with her own ideas, came up with the current layout. The major
changes you should notice are a cleanup of the page format and the
addition of &ldquo;<span   class="emphasis"><em>continued-from</em></span>&rdquo; lines on the
continuation pages of articles which include a keyword so you know
what article you are reading. Also, she is putting a lot of effort
into minimizing the number of jumps within articles. Please let us
know what you think of her work.</p><p>The second big change is still under way but should be done
by the time you read this. We have established a WWW site,
www.ssc.com. As well as having information on SSC products, we will
be putting up information from <i  >Linux Journal</i>.
First we will put up the tables of contents and advertisers indices
and then add some of the articles from the magazine. Advertisers
can request links from their index entry to their web page and, if
they don't have their own web site, for a nominal fee we will put
their web pages on www.ssc.com. If you are an advertiser and need
more information on this, contact Carlie Fairchild at (206)
782-7733.</p><p>As well as SSC and <i  >Linux Journal</i>
information, we will have some general Linux information on the
site so if you are looking for something to browse try
<a href="http://www.ssc.com" target="_self">www.ssc.com</a>.
This is, of course, a Linux machine. If there are things you think
should be added to the site, send e-mail to
<a href="mailto:info@linuxjournal.com">info@linuxjournal.com</a>.</p><p>Finally, with Linux 1.2 out there, more commercial vendors
are starting to take Linux seriously. If you see anyone with a
commercial interest in Linux, whether it is a vendor interested in
making their product work with Linux or a company that is using
Linux, please point them our way. The more information of
commercial interest we can get in <i  >LJ</i>, the easier it is for us to
convince others that Linux is a viable alternative to other
operating systems.</p></div></div>
