    Jeff gives us a quick introduction to the SlickEdit editor, a
    small, efficient programmer's editor which is available on many
    platforms, including Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe8f580.0xf87348"></a></h2></div></div><p>MicroEdge, Inc. has released a version of
SlickEdit for Linux. SlickEdit is a character-based programmer's
editor running on a variety of platforms and it should appeal to
developers who work in more than one environment. The current list
price is US $195.
</p><p>For a programmer arriving from a DOS environment, SlickEdit
provides a comfortable transition. Instead of arcane keystrokes and
endless keyboard remapping, the user is presented with an
unobtrusive menu system which may be later discarded. Pressing F1
brings up the help system and the behavior of particular keys, such
as insert and delete, act in the manner to which the DOS user is
accustomed.</p><p>SlickEdit can be considered a fairly complete editor in that
it provides most of the features necessary for productive coding.
It has full undo and redo capability, even past successive file
saves. Multi-file search and replace is supported along with
regular expression searches. Cut and paste operations may be
performed on marked lines, blocks, and columns. Multiple clipboards
of marked text are maintained. A Rexx-like macro language provides
over 850 callable editor functions.</p><p>A single diskette installs SlickEdit onto /usr/bin and
/usr/lib/slick by default, consuming about 2Mb of disk space. Less
space is necessary if you choose not to install all the macro
files. The SlickEdit executable is only 260K. A 400-page perfect
bound manual is included with the application.</p><p>There are three ways you may wish to use SlickEdit on a Linux
system: console, terminal, or xterm. Each has its own peculiarities
and you will probably want to create a separate keyboard
description file for each. A key mapping utility called
<span   class="bold"><b>genktab</b></span> allows you to tell
SlickEdit what to expect when a key is pressed. A readable keyboard
description file is compiled into a &ldquo;.tab&rdquo; file. Another utility,
<span   class="bold"><b>showkey</b></span>, is provided to help you
determine what sequences your terminal is generating.</p><p>Most of the common terminal types are included in the default
keyboard description file, including vt100 and xterm. To work with
xterm, the file /usr/lib/slick/xdefault must be appended to the
.Xdefaults file in your $HOME directory. A special
<span   class="bold"><b>xs</b></span> script is included to avoid the
initial configuration hurdles. Under xterm the window can be
dynamically resized with the mouse, but the mouse cannot be used to
manipulate text within the screen. MicroEdge has stated they intend
to add mouse support for Unix in a future version of
SlickEdit.</p><p>Under console mode, SlickEdit is virtually indistinguishable
from its DOS version. The Alt-F1 thru Alt-F4 keys may need to be
remapped to provide functions such as <b  >MOVE-EDGE</b>
and <b  >DELETE-ADJACENT</b>, since most Linux systems
use these key combinations to provide virtual terminals. You also
can perform these operations from the SlickEdit menu or configure
the Alt key for a non-console terminal as described below.</p><p>Setting up a terminal to act the way a normal DOS user
expects is challenging, especially for a text editor. The Alt key
has no counterpart with most terminals in standard use today.
MicroEdge works around this problem by defining the backtick (`)
key as the Alt key for a non-console, non-xterm terminal. In
practice this adaptation is easy and natural to use. To enter an
actual backtick, a <b  >^Q `</b> sequence is
entered.</p><p>Another potential problem with using a terminal is common to
many Unix applications^-namely the confusion resulting in sending
an escape sequence (say, F1 under ANSI emulation) and a literal
escape (<b  >0x1b</b>) character. This is not peculiar to
either Linux or SlickEdit, but it is more noticeable in text
editing applications where you're likely to be pounding the arrow
keys a lot. SlickEdit attempts to alleviate this by allowing the
user to specify a delay for an ambiguous key sequence. On other
Unix systems I have noticed that this is not always 100%
successful, especially if you are running telnet through through
heavily loaded systems. However, my limited use on Linux uncovered
no problems.</p><p>If you purchase SlickEdit, you have, at a minimum, two
expectations: ease of use and technical support. After
configuration, SlickEdit has very few surprises. Getting to the
point that you are satisfied with your configuration, however, may
require a phone call to Technical Support. My prior experience with
MicroEdge's support has been very good, and this time was no
exception. Basically, I wanted true 8-bit line drawing characters
rather than the stodgy hyphen, plus, and vertical bar (<b  >- +
|</b>) symbols displayed. My call was returned in 30 minutes.
After ascertaining what I needed, the specialist offered to e-mail
me the necessary file, with the assurance that I could call him
back if there were any further problems. My ANSI.DAT file arrived
later that day and everything worked as expected. MicroEdge also
supports a CompuServe forum: &ldquo;go slickedit&rdquo;.</p><p>My overall impression is that MicroEdge has done an excellent
job in porting SlickEdit to Linux. I have written many lines of
code over the past two years with the SlickEdit family of editors
on a variety of platforms. There are certainly other freeware
alternatives to the venerable <span   class="bold"><b>vi</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>Emacs</b></span> editors, but I find my
level of productivity is raised (and frustration lowered) by using
SlickEdit.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe8f580.0xf87b30"></a>Resources</h2></div></div><p>MicroEdge, Inc. may be contacted by phone at (800) 934-EDIT
