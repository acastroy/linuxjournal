    Who is Caldera, and what is Corsair, really?
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c8580.0x14c0298"></a></h2></div></div><p>Many conflicting rumors about Novell's
&ldquo;Corsair&rdquo; project have been floating about the Internet. Recently,
there have been sensationalized stories that Ray Noorda, formerly
the President and Chief Executive of Novell, is backing a company
called Caldera to use the &ldquo;Corsair&rdquo; technology to take Microsoft on
head-to-head. While that makes for an interesting story, at
<i  >Linux Journal</i> we prefer facts to hype. Here is
Caldera's story.
</p><p>Who is Caldera, and what is Corsair, really? Corsair was&mdash;and
still is&mdash;a project at Novell to create a &ldquo;desktop metaphor&rdquo; for
the network. A year or so ago at Novell, an advanced technology
group was doing research on how to better and more easily integrate
and manage network access for users, and they decided to focus on
the desktop. While they liked Unix, they wanted something smaller
and faster to put their &ldquo;Internet desktop&rdquo; on, (not to mention
something requiring a smaller royalty stream than Unix&mdash;yes, Novell
pays royalties to other companies that developed parts of
Unix).</p><p>Several members of the group became convinced that Linux was
the best answer to their search. They started to work with Linux,
contributing code back to the Linux development team and to other
projects related to Linux, including the Linux DOS emulator. Their
work included work on the IPX networking layer of Linux, support
for the Wine project, and several other smaller parts.</p><p>When Robert Frankenberg took over the CEO position at Novell
in 1994, he cut out many of the exploratory projects that were then
underway in an attempt to focus Novell on &ldquo;core competencies&rdquo;.
While many in the industry lauded this, it did end all of the work
on Linux-related features of Corsair, and Corsair now is an
&ldquo;Internet desktop&rdquo; for MS Windows.</p><p>Several of the members of the group were not satisfied with
this, and quit to form their own company, with financial and
strategic backing from Ray Noorda, to continue working on this
desktop&mdash;under Linux. This new company is Caldera.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c8580.0x14c0558"></a>Myths Debunked</h2></div></div><p>Caldera's product is not an MS Windows clone, as some have
reported. It <span   class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> include an MS-Windows-like
API, licensed from Willows Software, which is another Noorda-backed
company. This will allow companies with MS Windows applications to
port those applications easily to Linux. Caldera does
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> intend to have an &ldquo;ABI&rdquo; (application
<span   class="emphasis"><em>binary</em></span> interface) that is guaranteed to run
existing Windows applications. Because they have worked for a high
level of compatibility at the &ldquo;API&rdquo; (application
<span   class="emphasis"><em>programming</em></span> interface) level, there is a high
probability that some MS Windows binaries will run, but they say
that is not what they are attempting to accomplish.</p><p>Caldera says their product is not intended to be an MS
Windows killer: they are not trying to put Bill Gates out of
business. They instead wish to provide an alternative: a
commercially supported distribution of Linux bundled with
commercial components.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c8580.0x14c0818"></a>Commercial Components</h2></div></div><p>The commercial components, which will require separate
licensing, will include the Windows-like API, the Corsair-like
desktop, a netware client, and OpenDoc support. Truetype font
support is also planned. So-called personal productivity
applications will be bundled or sold separately. Caldera-developed
documentation will be included as a part of the product.</p><p>While Caldera will be providing many commercial components,
they have publicly promised to fully honor the GNU Public License,
including providing full source code for all the GPL-licensed
software they ship. The GPL is what has made Linux useful to them,
and they say that it lowers and removes barriers for many small
companies who want to compete in the software marketplace. They
suggest that Linux will increase innovation in the software
marketplace, and they want to push this along. They quote Ray
Noorda as saying, &ldquo;That's exactly what we are out to do&mdash;to grow
[the whole Linux] industry.&rdquo; Promoting Linux is good for
everyone.</p><p>Caldera has instructed their public relations firm to promote
Linux, as well as Caldera, believing that by giving Linux added
exposure, the entire market will grow, benefiting everyone in it,
including themselves. In addition, they will continue to contribute
work on free software, doing their part to help keep Linux
innovative and open. When they chose a business partner to build
their distribution, they chose another company that licenses its
software under the GPL, Red Hat Software.</p><p>Caldera is not the only company to provide supported,
shrink-wrapped distributions of Linux, nor is it the only company
to sell commercial applications for Linux. Caldera suggests that
they have two distinguishing characteristics: first, they have Ray
Noorda behind the company, which gives them credibility and
financial flexibility when they are negotiating with large software
companies; and second, Caldera will focus on helping and
encouraging existing independent software vendors and manufacturers
to port their programs to the Caldera desktop in an attempt to
provide types of software that have been unavailable for Linux in
the past.</p></div></div>
