issue] interesting. I think that there was one major point that was
missed. Administrators should not randomly assign ports to
services. In fact there is an RFC that lists the ports. The latest
is rfc1700. This is very important for novices to learn.</p><p>&mdash;Matthew B.

(<a href="mailto:g_leach@pavo.concordia.ca">g_leach@pavo.concordia.ca</a>)
in the April 1995 issue of <i  >Linux Journal</i>. Your magazine is
excellent. But the &ldquo;linked list&rdquo; format is annoying. Please avoid
it, or at least minimize it.</p><p>I disagree with one of your justifications, namely that
readers expect &ldquo;important&rdquo; articles near the front of the magazine.
I certainly don't. I would guess that most of your regular readers,
like me, would read each issue cover-to-cover, and more than once.
Perhaps you could poll your readers, to find out for sure.</p><p>As I said, your magazine is superb. But the format makes it
difficult to read, needlessly so.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>&mdash;Carl

Great!</p><p>WRT the split article issue raised by Graham Leach in a
letter to the editor, may I suggest something that worked well for
me back in the dark ages of paste-ups: Instead of &ldquo;no jumps&rdquo;, which
is really tough, how about a goal of no more than one jump per
article. It would also be helpful to add the article name to the
&ldquo;continued from...&rdquo; at the top of jump pages.</p><p>Thanks for an interesting, readable book.</p><p>&mdash;John Miller,

from the article title added to the &ldquo;continued from&rdquo; lines, as you
suggest. Also, I agree with the one jump max rule and we will try
for that. From more information on our new layout, please see Stop
the Presses.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x194e580.0x1a46a28"></a>Scilab Revisited</h2></div></div><p>I was very pleased to read Robert A. Dalrymple's article on
Scilab. I've been using Scilab for 7 years and I think that it is a
terrific product (much more powerful than Matlab). It's wonderful
that INRIA decided to make this tool available to the public as
free software.</p><p>My purpose for writing this letter is that I think your
readers will be interested in knowing some additional facts about
Scilab which did not come out in the article. One of the most
powerful aspects of Scilab is its ability to easily perform data
abstraction and operator overloading.</p><p>Scilab is delivered with several pre-defined abstract data
types such as rational polynomials and linear dynamic systems.
Overloading of the usual operators such as &ldquo;+&rdquo;, &ldquo;-&rdquo;, &ldquo;*&rdquo;, &ldquo;/&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;=&rdquo; allows the user to easily manipulate these abstract data types
and the development of higher level operations is greatly
simplified. Here is an example with two rationals:</p><pre     class="programlisting">

^&gt; r1=(2+3*s)/(1+s**2)
   r1        =
      2 + 3s
      ^^^-
           2
      1 + s
 ^&gt; r2=s/(5+s)
   r2        =
        s
      ^^^
      5 + s
 ^&gt; r3=r1+r2
   r3        =
                   2   3
      10 + 18s + 3s + s
      ^^^^^^^^^
                 2   3
       5 + s + 5s + s
</pre><p>Notice that even though the rationals in the example are user
defined objects, the overloading of the &ldquo;=&rdquo; operator gives rise to
a user friendly on-screen representation which is recognizable as
that of a rational. Furthermore since the &ldquo;+&rdquo; operator is
overloaded for rationals, their sum is defined and requires no
special function (like <b  >r3=poly_add(r1,r2)</b> as an
example).</p><p>The implementation of the rational abstract data type in
Scilab allows all the usual operations that one would expect
between two rationals as well as between a rational and other data
types (such as scalars and matrices).</p><p>The user of Scilab can easily define new abstract data types
and develop Scilab macros for the implementation of user
transparent operator overloading. These Scilab features are unique
in the Matlab-like class of products and is the reason for which I
believe that Scilab is a much more powerful product than
Matlab.</p><p>I hope that these comments will be of use to your
readers.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>&mdash;Carey
