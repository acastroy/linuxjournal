Account administration in a distributed UNIX/Linux
environment can become complicated and messy
if done by hand. Large sites use special tools to
deal with this problem. In this article, I describe how even
small installations, such as your three-computer network
at home, can take advantage of the same tools.
</p><p>
The problem in a distributed environment is that password and shadow files
need to be changed individually on each machine if an account change
occurs. Account changes include password changes, addition/removal of
accounts, account name changes (UID/GID changes are a big problem
in any case), addition/removal of login privileges to
computers and so on.
I also explain how the Kerberos distribution solves the authentication
problem in a distributed computing environment. In Part II, I will
describe a solution for the authorization problem.
</p><p>
The problem of authenticating users to a computer is solved mostly through
passwords, although other methods, including smart cards and biometrics, are available.
These passwords had been stored in /etc/passwd, but now with
shadow passwords, they reside
in /etc/shadow. Because these files are local to a computer, it is a
big problem keeping them up to date. Directory services such as
NIS, NIS+ and LDAP were invented to solve this problem. These services,
however, introduce a new problem: they work over the network and
expose passwords, which are encrypted only weakly.
</p><p>
The authentication protocol implemented by Kerberos combines the
advantages of being a networked service and of eliminating the need to
communicate passwords between computers altogether.
To do so, Kerberos requires you to run two d&aelig;mons on a secure server.
The Key Distribution Center (KDC) d&aelig;mon handles all password verification
requests and the generation of Kerberos credentials, called Ticket
Granting Tickets (TGTs). A second d&aelig;mon, the Kerberos Administration
d&aelig;mon, allows you to add, delete and modify accounts remotely
without logging in to the computer running the Kerberos d&aelig;mons. It also
handles password change requests from users. With Kerberos,
only a password change ever requires transmitting a strongly encrypted
password over the network.
</p><p>
The Kerberos KDC grants a temporary credential, a TGT, to the account
during the process of authenticating the user. Typically, these credentials have a
lifetime of 10 or 24 hours. This lifetime can be configured and should
be no longer than 24 hours, in case the TGT is stolen; a thief could
use it only for the remaining TGT lifetime. The credential expiration
causes no issues if you are using Kerberos only for authentication,
as described in this article. However, if you are using Kerberized
services, you need to train your users to obtain new credentials after
their current ones expire, even though they still are logged in.
</p><p>
Kerberos was invented at MIT. The latest version is Kerberos 5,
with its protocol defined in RFC 1510. Today, two Kerberos
implementations are freely available (see the on-line Resources). MIT's Kerberos 5 is included in
Red Hat Linux, whereas Heimdal is included in SuSE's and Debian's Linux
distributions. Kerberos 5 implementations also are included in Microsoft
Windows (2000 and later), in Sun's Solaris (SEAM, Solaris 2.6 and above)
and Apple's Mac OS X.
I use MIT's Kerberos distribution throughout this article because
it offers simple password quality checking, password aging and password
history out of the box.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148c558"></a>
Prerequisites</h2></div></div><p>
You have to meet two prerequisites before you can switch authentication
over to Kerberos.
First, the clocks on all computers to be included in your Kerberos
installation need to be synchronized to the clock of the machine running
the KDC. The simplest way of doing this is to use the Network Time
Protocol (NTP) on all your machines.
</p><p>
The second requirement is harder to meet. All account names, UIDs
and GIDs have to be the same on all your computers. This is necessary
because each of these accounts becomes a new and independent Kerberos
account, called a principal. You have to go through all your
local /etc/passwd files and check whether this requirement is met. If
not, you need to consolidate your accounts. If you want to add Windows
or Mac OS X clients to your Kerberos installation, you need to look at
all the accounts on those machines as well.
</p><p>
If you decide to use the Kerberos package that
comes with your Linux distribution, simply install it.
If you want to compile the Kerberos
distribution yourself, follow the instructions below.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148c710"></a>
Building and Installing MIT Kerberos</h2></div></div><p>
1) Get the source from one of the URLs listed in the on-line Resources. Get the PGP signature of the source package and verify the
integrity of the downloaded source with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% gpg --verify krb5-1.3.4.targz.asc
</pre>
</p><p>
2) Unpack the source with:


<pre     class="programlisting">
% tar zxvf krb5-1.3.4.tar.gz
</pre>
</p><p>
3) Change into the source directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% cd krb5-1.3.4/src
</pre>
</p><p>
4) Execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% ./configure --help
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148ca80"></a></h2></div></div><p>
This tells you if you need to use special configure options for your
site. /usr/local/ is the default installation directory. If you need
this software in another directory, use a --prefix=/new/path/to/directory
flag in the next step.
</p><p>
5) In almost all cases, the default should be fine:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% ./configure
</pre>
</p><p>
6) Compile the package with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% make
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148cce8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I had a problem with one file in the krb5-1.3.4/src/kadmin/testing/util
directory, which can be safely ignored. Restart the compilation with
<tt  >%
make -i</tt> in this case.
</p><p>
7) Check whether everything compiled correctly with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% make check
</pre>
</p><p>
8) If everything looks okay, install the package with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sudo make install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148cfa8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Never compile code as root. Use root privileges only when necessary, as
in these installation steps.
</p><p>
9) You now have MIT Krb5 installed in /usr/local/. Some additional
directories need to be created by hand and their permissions set:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/var/krb5kdc
% sudo chown root /usr/local/var/krb5kdc
% sudo chmod 700 /usr/local/var/krb5kdc
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148d160"></a></h2></div></div><p>
If you really need or want to compile your own PAM module, here are
the steps to get a working version of the module shipped by Red Hat.
Get the source (see Resources)
and upack it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% tar zxf pam_krb5-1.3-rc7.tar.gz

% cd pam_krb5-1.3-rc7
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148d2c0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Your $PATH environment variable has to have the Kerberos distribution
of your choice first, in case you have more than one distribution on
your computer. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148d420"></a></h2></div></div><p>
if you have installed your own version in /usr/local. Then execute:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% ./configure
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148d580"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Then compile and install the package with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% make
% sudo make install
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148d6e0"></a>
Creating Your Realm</h2></div></div><p>
A Kerberos realm is an administrative domain that
has its own Kerberos database. Each Kerberos realm
has its own set of Kerberos servers. The name of
your realm can be anything, but it should reflect your
place in the DNS world. If the new Kerberos realm is
for your entire DNS domain example.com, you should
give the same name (with all capital letters, this
is a Kerberos convention) to your Kerberos realm:
EXAMPLE.COM. Or, if your are setting up a new
realm for your engineering department in example.com,
a realm name of ENG.EXAMPLE.COM could be chosen.
</p><p>
The first step for creating your own realm is to
create a /etc/krb5.conf file that contains all
the necessary information about this realm. The
krb5.conf file needs to be on every computer that
wants access to your new Kerberos realm. Here is an
example file for the realm EXAMPLE.COM with the
KDC and administration servers running on machine
kdc.example.com:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[libdefaults]
    # determines your default realm name
    default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM

[realms]
    EXAMPLE.COM = {
        # specifies where the servers are and on
        # which ports they listen (88 and 749 are
        # the standard ports)
        kdc = kdc.example.com:88
        admin_server = kdc.example.com:749
    }

[domain_realm]
    # maps your DNS domain name to your Kerberos
    # realm name
    .example.com = EXAMPLE.COM

[logging]
    # determines where each service should write its
    # logging info
    kdc = SYSLOG:INFO:DAEMON
    admin_server = SYSLOG:INFO:DAEMON
    default = SYSLOG:INFO:DAEMON
</pre>
</p><p>
The next file, /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kdc.conf, configures the KDC server.
It needs to be on only the computer running the KDC d&aelig;mon.
Every entry has a reasonable default. Creating an empty file should be
sufficient for most cases:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sudo touch /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kdc.conf
</pre>
</p><p>
The following commands need to be executed on the computer that will become
your KDC.
The command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sudo /usr/local/sbin/kdb5_util create -s
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148d9f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
creates an initial Kerberos database for the new realm. It asks you for the
database master password for the new realm and stores it in a file
(/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/.k5.EXAMPLE.COM).
This command also creates a first set of principals in your Kerberos 5 account
database. You can list them by using:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sudo /usr/local/sbin/kadmin.local
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x148db58"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and then typing <tt  >listprincs</tt> at the kadmin.local: prompt.
This prints the list:

<pre     class="programlisting">
K/M@EXAMPLE.COM
kadmin/admin@EXAMPLE.COM
kadmin/changepw@EXAMPLE.COM
kadmin/history@EXAMPLE.COM
krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x14845a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At this time, we are not ready to use the remote version of the
kadmin tool.
</p><p>
Before you start creating any principals in your new
realm, you should define a policy that determines
how passwords are handled:


<pre     class="programlisting">
kadmin.local:  add_policy -maxlife 180days -minlife
&#8618;2days -minlength 8 -minclasses 3
&#8618;-history 10 default
</pre>
</p><p>
This input defines a default policy used for every principal we create
from now on. It determines that the maximum lifetime for passwords is 180
days. The minimum lifetime is two days. The minimum password length is
eight
characters, and these characters have to come from three different classes out of
these five available ones: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, punctuation and others.
A history of the last ten passwords is kept to prevent reuse.
If you want to have passwords checked against a dictionary, add a dict_file
definition such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[realms]
    EXAMPLE.COM = {
        dict_file = /usr/share/dict/words
    }
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x1484808"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to your kdc.conf file.
</p><p>
You now are ready to create an administration principal for yourself:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kadmin.local: addprinc john/admin
</pre>
</p><p>
Adjust the name to <span   class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> account name but keep the
/admin.
It then asks twice for a new password for this principal.
You can look at the new account with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kadmin.local:  getprinc john/admin
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x1484ac8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which prints something like:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Principal: john/admin@EXAMPLE.COM
Expiration date: [never]
Last password change: Wed Dec 24 09:55:17 PST 2003
Password expiration date: Mon Jun 21 10:55:17 PDT 2004
Maximum ticket life: 1 day 00:00:00
Maximum renewable life: 0 days 00:00:00
Last modified: Wed Dec 24 09:55:17 PST 2003 (root/admin@EXAMPLE.COM)
Last successful authentication: [never]
Last failed authentication: [never]
Failed password attempts: 0
Number of keys: 2
Key: vno 1, Triple DES cbc mode with HMAC/sha1, no salt
Key: vno 1, DES cbc mode with CRC-32, no salt
Attributes:

</pre>
</p><p>
Exit the kadmin.local program by typing <tt  >quit</tt> and start the KDC
d&aelig;mon with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sudo /usr/local/sbin/krb5kdc
</pre>
</p><p>
Get a Kerberos 5 TGT by typing:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% /usr/local/bin/kinit john/admin@EXAMPLE.COM
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x1484de0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
and look at your TGT with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% /usr/local/bin/klist
Ticket cache: FILE:/tmp/krb5cc_5828
Default principal: john/admin@EXAMPLE.COM

Valid starting     Expires            Service principal
12/23/03 14:15:39  12/24/03 14:15:39  krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x1484f40"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Congratulations! You just completed your first successful Kerberos authentication.
</p><p>
You now need to specify which privileges this administration account should
have, which is determined by entries in the file
/usr/local/var/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl.
You can give john/admin permissions to administer all principals, indicated
by the wildcard character *, by adding the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">
john/admin@EXAMPLE.COM  *
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x14850f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
to this file.
</p><p>
Before you can start using the administration d&aelig;mon (kadmind) over the network,
you have to create a keytab file containing the key for one of the kadmin
principals created when we initialized our realm:


<pre     class="programlisting">
kadmin.local:  ktadd -k /usr/local/var/krb5kdc/
&#8618;kadm5.keytab kadmin/changepw
</pre>
</p><p>
Now everything is ready for the Kerberos administration d&aelig;mon.
Start it with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% sudo /usr/local/sbin/kadmind
</pre>
</p><p>
This d&aelig;mon allows you to administer your Kerberos principals remotely,
without logging in to your KDC, using the kadmin client tool.
If you want your Kerberos d&aelig;mons to start up automatically at boot time, add
them to your KDC's /etc/rc files.
</p><p>
With the Kerberos TGT obtained above, start the remote
administration tool:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% /usr/local/sbin/kadmin
Authenticating as principal john/admin@EXAMPLE.COM
with password.
Password for john/admin@EXAMPLE.COM:
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x1485468"></a>
Adding New Accounts</h2></div></div><p>
New accounts still need to be added to your shadow file or password map.
However, instead of putting the encrypted password into these places, you
have to create a new Kerberos principal and store the password in the KDC.
</p><p>
Using the kadmin tool:

<pre     class="programlisting">
% /usr/local/sbin/kadmin
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x1485620"></a></h2></div></div><p>
add a principal for a regular users with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kadmin:  addprinc john
NOTICE: no policy specified for john@EXAMPLE.COM; assigning "default"
Enter password for principal "john@EXAMPLE.COM":
Re-enter password for principal "john@EXAMPLE.COM":
Principal "john@EXAMPLE.COM" created.
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x1485780"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The password you have entered during this principal creation process is the one
john needs to enter in order to obtain a Kerberos TGT or to log in to
a computer configured to use your Kerberos 5 realm.
</p><p>
You now either can create principals for all your accounts by hand or
use the technique described in the migration section below.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x14858e0"></a>
Adding Slave KDCs</h2></div></div><p>
If you plan to use Kerberos in production at your
site, you should plan on using additional slave
KDCs to make your installation more fault tolerant.
For this, the master KDC needs to have an additional
propagation service installed that sends updated
versions of the KDC database to all slave servers. The
slave servers need to have a receiving end for
the propagation service installed. See the MIT
documentation for how to set this up.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x14859e8"></a>
Configuring the Clients</h2></div></div><p>
The easiest way to enable a computer for Kerberos
authentication is to use a pluggable authentication
module (PAM). Because it uses Kerberos API calls,
it needs a working /etc/krb5.conf file. So, the first
step is to copy the /etc/krb5.conf file from your KDC
(see above) to each client machine.
</p><p>
Kerberos is used not only to authenticate users, it
also is used to authenticate computers, to prevent
you from logging in to a machine with a hijacked
IP address. For this to work, each computer needs
its own Kerberos principal with the key (the
password) stored in a file (a keytab file).
Principals for computers have the special form:

<pre     class="programlisting">
host/&lt;hostname&gt;.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM.
</pre>
</p><p>
The first step is to create a new principal for each of your client machines.
The following commands use the computer name client1 as an example.
Replace the string client1 with the hostname of the client computer.
Log in to every one of your client computers and execute:


<pre     class="programlisting">
% sudo /usr/local/sbin/kadmin
kadmin: addprinc -randkey host/
&#8618;client1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x1485c50"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which assigns a random password to the new principal.
Then, extract the key into a keytab file with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
kadmin: ktadd host/client1.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1394580.0x1485db0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
which creates the file /etc/krb5.keytab. To have write permissions to the
/etc/ directory, you need to run the kadmin command with sudo. Simply creating
a new principal would not have required these special privileges.
Watch out for the ownership and file permissions of /etc/krb5.keytab,
however; it has
to be readable only by root. Otherwise, the security of this machine is
compromised.
</p><p>
Several PAM modules for Kerberos 5 are available
and all are called pam_krb5. Most of these do not
work any more due to some API changes in MIT Kerberos 5
version 1.3. Your best choice right now is to use the
PAM module that comes with your Linux distribution.
See the section above on how to build a PAM module for
Kerberos 5 from source.
</p><p>
Now, add the new PAM module to your system's
authentication stack by editing the file
/etc/pam.d/system-auth (on Red Hat systems). The
entries should look similar to these Red Hat 9
entries:

<pre     class="programlisting">
auth  required    /lib/security/$ISA/pam_env.so
auth  sufficient  /lib/security/$ISA/pam_unix.so likeauth nullok
auth  sufficient  /lib/security/$ISA/pam_krb5.so use_first_pass
auth  required    /lib/security/$ISA/pam_deny.so

These changes make every program with the system-auth PAM stack in
its PAM configuration file (see the other files in /etc/pam.d/) use Kerberos
for its authentication.

Interoperation with Non-Linux Clients</h2></div></div><p>
If you already have a working Windows Active Directory (AD) KDC installation,
you can use it as the master KDC for your Linux/UNIX machines.
In this case, you can skip the entire server installation and do only the
above described setup of your clients. Your /etc/krb5.conf file needs to
define the Windows KDC instead of a UNIX KDC. For more information on
how to create and copy a keytab file and this scenario in general, see
Resources.
</p><p>
If you have a number of Windows machines in
your group, you can use your UNIX KDC for them as
well. This works, however, only if your Windows
clients don't belong to a Windows AD domain
with Kerberos already and the account names are the same
in Kerberos and Windows. See Resources
for details.
</p><p>
Using Mac OS X clients in your Kerberos 5 realm is as easy as configuring
the names of your UNIX KDCs on your Macs. Again, account names have to match.

Migration from Local Passwords or NIS/LDAP to Kerberos</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have a working Kerberos 5 realm and your
clients configured, you have to convert all your user
accounts. So far, the passwords for your accounts
are stored either in the machine's local /etc/shadow
files or in a NIS/LDAP password map. These passwords
are encrypted with a one-way hash function that
makes it impossible, or at least impractical for
people without a supercomputer, to crack them or to
convert everything into Kerberos 5 format.
A good way to migrate from your current situation
to Kerberos is to use pam_krb5_migrate (see Resources).
This stackable PAM module can be installed on a few
computers; every time someone logs on, it creates
a new principal for this account in your Kerberos 5
KDC reusing the account's current password.
</p><p>
After everybody has logged on to these special
machines, all your users have a corresponding Kerberos
5 principal. You then can replace the passwords in
your local files or your NIS/LDAP password map with
a placeholder, such as krb5. The Kerberos PAM module
authenticates your users from now on. At this
point, you also can remove pam_krb5_migrate from the
migration systems.

Kerberized Applications</h2></div></div><p>
Now that you have Kerberos up and running,
you can use services that make use of it. You
could install Kerberized telnet and FTP, but
you really should use SSH. You could Kerberize
your Apache Web server and your Mozilla Web browser.
Before Kerberos, you would have to type your password
when using these services. With Kerberos, all
these applications are using your stored Kerberos
credentials and use them internally to authenticate
you for the respective service. This is what many
mean by single-sign-on.
