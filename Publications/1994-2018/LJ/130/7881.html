Which virtual private network is right for you? Mick runs down the options
and comes up with some winners and some warnings.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b04580.0x1bfc3a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Virtual private networks, or VPNs, are useful and convenient things.
Road warriors use them to connect to their home networks securely while
traveling; geographically dispersed organizations use them to encrypt
WAN links that use public bandwidth; and wireless LAN users use them to
add a layer of security to their WLAN connections.
</p><p>
A number of VPN packages are available for Linux: FreeS/WAN, OpenS/WAN,
PoPToP, OpenVPN and tinc, just to name a few. But how do you choose
the right one for a given job? I show you how in this month's column.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b04580.0x1bfc500"></a>
VPN Architecture</h2></div></div><p>
VPNs generally address two different needs. The first is the need to
allow users to connect to a private network with an encrypted connection
through some untrusted medium, such as the Internet or a wireless LAN
(WLAN). Figure 1 illustrates the remote-access scenario.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7881f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Remote-access VPNs allow one remote system to connect
to a network.
</p></div></div><p>
In Figure 1, the dashed-blue data flow implies access to the
entire corporate LAN. In practice, a remote-access VPN tunnel can limit
that access through access control lists (ACLs) or firewall rules. Access
can even, in the case of SSL-VPN, be limited to a single application
on a single host (I'll explain SSL-VPN shortly).
</p><p>
For simplicity's sake, Figure 1 shows a single client; however, this scenario
nearly always involves many clients. In other words, the remote-access
scenario requires a client-server architecture in which a single VPN
server or concentrator can build tunnels with hundreds or even thousands
of remote users. (In this article I'm using the term client-server
in a very broad sense, not in the specific software development sense.)
</p><p>
Although Figure 1 shows a VPN server acting as the corporate LAN's VPN
endpoint, the firewall also could be used for this&mdash;both commercial and
free firewalls, including Linux iptables/Netfilter, support VPN protocols.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Important</b></span>: in this article when I say tunnel, I mean
encrypted tunnel. Yes, technically the term tunnel simply means
one data stream encapsulated into another. But the whole point
of VPNs is encryption, so in this context, tunnel equals encryption.
</p><p>
The second VPN need is to create an encrypted point-to-point connection
between two different networks over some untrusted medium. Whereas
remote-access VPNs use a client-server model, point-to-point tunnels use a
peer-to-peer model. Figure 2 shows a point-to-point VPN architecture.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="7881f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Point-to-point VPNs connect two networks.
</p></div></div><p>
Routers often are used in the point-to-point VPN scenario. Cisco's IOS
router operating system, for example, supports several different VPN
protocols. Firewalls and dedicated VPN concentrators/servers, however,
also can be used as VPN endpoints.
</p><p>
Those are the two problems that VPN architectures address.
Two more architectural considerations are worth mentioning, network address
translation (NAT) and performance.
</p><p>
With most VPN protocols, NAT can be problematic. That is, your VPN servers
generally can't have translated addresses. This is why, in both Figures
1 and 2, none of the VPN endpoints are in corporate LANs, except for the
remote client in Figure 1&mdash;remote-access clients are the exception to
this rule.
</p><p>
Using your firewall as a VPN server is one way to get around the NAT
problem, but that brings us to the second consideration: VPN tunnels
can be CPU-intensive. Unless your firewall has a crypto-accelerator card
or doesn't need to support many concurrent VPN tunnels, you're probably
better off using a dedicated VPN server than you are using your firewall
for VPNs.
</p><p>
Now that we've covered the basics, let's look at specific VPN software
for Linux.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b04580.0x1bfcd40"></a>
FreeS/WAN and OpenS/WAN</h2></div></div><p>
The IPSec protocol, which really is a set of security headers in the
Internet Protocol (IP) v6 back-ported to IPv4, is the most open,
powerful and secure VPN protocol. It's also the most ubiquitous.
IPSec support is now part of virtually all important computer and
network-device operating systems. On Linux, it's provided by FreeS/WAN
and OpenS/WAN.
</p><p>
I covered FreeS/WAN in depth in &ldquo;An Introduction to
FreeS/WAN&rdquo;, Parts I
and II [in the January and February 2003 issues of
<i  >LJ</i>, respectively]. In a nutshell, FreeS/WAN
adds a couple of kernel modules and user-space commands to your Linux
system. Because the IP protocol is part of your kernel, it follows that
extensions to the IP protocol also must be incorporated into your kernel.
</p><p>
The Linux 2.6 kernel includes these IPSec modules,
called the 26sec modules. The Linux 2.4
kernels included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux do as well&mdash;they contain backported versions of the 26sec
modules. If you already have IPSec kernel modules,
you need install only FreeS/WAN's user-space commands.
</p><p>
FreeS/WAN may be included with your Linux distribution of choice (SuSE,
which is mine, includes it). However, the FreeS/WAN Project recently
folded, so if your distribution doesn't include FreeS/WAN and you need
to compile it from source, you're better off using OpenS/WAN.
</p><p>
OpenS/WAN was started by a group of FreeS/WAN developers who were unhappy
with how things were going with the FreeS/WAN Project. Thus, when FreeS/WAN
ended, OpenS/WAN succeeded it. Eventually, we can expect the major Linux
distributors to replace their FreeS/WAN packages with OpenS/WAN. In
the meantime, you can obtain the latest OpenS/WAN source code from
the OpenS/WAN Web site (see the on-line Resources).
</p><p>
Advantages of FreeS/WAN and OpenS/WAN include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Maturity: this is one of the older Linux VPN technologies.
</p></li><li><p>
Security: IPSec is a robust, powerful and well-designed protocol.
</p></li><li><p>
Interoperability: client systems running other OSes probably have
IPSec client software that interoperates with Free/OpenS/WAN.
</p></li><li><p>
Flexibility: IPSec is ideal for both remote-access and point-to-point
VPNs.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Disadvantages include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Complexity: IPSec is not easy to understand, and it requires digital
certificates.
</p></li><li><p>
Power: if all you need to do is provide remote users with access to
one application running on one internal system, IPSec may be overkill.
IPSec is designed to connect entire networks to each other.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Having said that, if after reading this entire article you're still
confused as to which VPN solution is best for you, I recommend that you
default to FreeS/WAN or OpenS/WAN. IPSec is by far the most mature and
secure VPN technology for Linux. In my opinion, these advantages outweigh
the disadvantage of being complex. See the FreeS/WAN
and OpenS/WAN Web sites for more information on configuring and using
these packages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b04580.0x1bfd630"></a>
OpenSSH</h2></div></div><p>
It's tempting to think of OpenSSH purely as a remote shell tool. But the
SSH protocol supports the secure tunneling of <span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> single-TCP-port
service, not only shells, by using the -L and -R options.
</p><p>
For example, suppose I have a secure shell server in a firewalled
but publicly accessible DMZ network and a Microsoft SQL server in my
internal network. If I create a firewall rule allowing MS-SQL transactions
from the SSH server to the MS-SQL server and if my SSH server allows
port forwarding, I could create an SSH tunnel between some remote host
and my SSH server that allows remote database clients to send queries
to the remote host that are tunneled to the SSH server and forwarded to
the MS-SQL server. The SSH command on my remote host would look like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
bash-#&gt; ssh -L 11433:ms-sql.server.name:1433 myaccount@remote.ssh-server.name
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b04580.0x1bfd840"></a></h2></div></div><p>
where <tt  >ms-sql.server.name</tt> is the name or IP address of the MS-SQL
server, and <tt  >remote.ssh-server.name</tt> is the name or IP address of the
DMZed SSH server.
</p><p>
It's even possible to tunnel PPP over SSH, which technically achieves
the same thing as IPSec&mdash;that is, the ability to tunnel
<span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> traffic
between two networks. However, this is one of the least efficient means
of doing so; it involves much more administrative overhead than the
other tools and methods described in this article.
</p><p>
In summary, OpenSSH is a good tool for tunneling traffic from specific
applications running on specific hosts; it can be used in this way in
both remote-access and point-to-point VPN scenarios. It is less useful,
however, for tunneling all traffic between remote networks or users.
</p><p>
See the ssh(1) and sshd_config(5) man pages for more information on using
OpenSSH for port forwarding.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b04580.0x1bfdb58"></a>
Stunnel</h2></div></div><p>
Conceptually, Stunnel, an SSL wrapper,
provides functionality equivalent to SSH port
forwarding. Stunnel is a standard package on most
Linux distributions nowadays.
</p><p>
The main difference between Stunnel and SSH is that Stunnel is much
more limited; <span   class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> it does is encrypted port forwarding. Also,
because Stunnel really is a sort of front end for OpenSSL, Stunnel
requires you to configure and install digital certificates, which perhaps
offsets some of its simplicity.
Otherwise, Stunnel shares OpenSSH's limitations as a VPN tool.
</p><p>
See the stunnel(8) man page, the Stunnel Web site and my article
&ldquo;Rehabilitating Cleartext Network Applications with Stunnel&rdquo;
(<i  >LJ</i>, September 2004)
for information on configuring and using Stunnel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b04580.0x1ff6068"></a>
OpenVPN</h2></div></div><p>
OpenVPN is an SSL/TLS-based user-space
VPN tool that encapsulates all traffic between VPN endpoints inside
ordinary UDP or TCP packets (ordinary in the sense that they
don't require any modifications to your kernel's IP stack). OpenVPN was
created because in the opinion of its author, James Yonan, the world
needed a less complex alternative to IPSec.
</p><p>
Because no special kernel modules or modifications are necessary, OpenVPN
runs purely in user space, making it much easier to port across operating
systems than IPSec implementations. And, by virtue of using the
standard OpenSSL libraries, OpenVPN, like Stunnel, does a minimum of
wheel re-invention. Unlike homegrown cryptosystems, such as those used in
the CIPE and tinc VPN packages (see below), all of OpenVPN's critical
operations are handled by OpenSSL. OpenSSL itself certainly isn't
flawless, but it's under constant scrutiny for security flaws and
is maintained by some of the Open Source community's finest crypto
programmers.
</p><p>
OpenVPN is a good match for point-to-point VPNs,
but until version 2.0 (still in beta as of this
writing, November 2004), OpenVPN had the limitation
of being able to accommodate only a single tunnel
on a given listening port. If you wanted to use
OpenVPN to provide remote-access VPN tunnels to ten
different users, you needed to run ten different
OpenVPN listeners, each using its own UDP port,
such as UDP 10201, UDP 10202 and UDP 10203 and
seven more. Therefore, if you want to use OpenVPN
for remote-access VPNs, you'll be much happier with
OpenVPN 2.0 (even in its beta state), unless you have
only a handful of users.
</p><p>
OpenVPN is included with SuSE Linux 9.1 and probably other distributions
as well. See the OpenVPN Web site for configuration information and for
the latest OpenVPN software.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b04580.0x1ff6278"></a>
PoPToP and the Linux PPTP Client</h2></div></div><p>
IPSec isn't the only low-level VPN protocol used on the
Internet. Microsoft's Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) also
has its adherents, mainly because it has been a standard component of
Microsoft's server operating systems since Windows NT 4.0 and because,
unlike IPSec, which can only tunnel IP packets, PPTP can be used to
tunnel not only IP but also other protocols, such as NETBEUI and IPX/SPX.
</p><p>
Linux support for PPTP comes in two flavors,
PoPToP on the server side and Linux PPTP Client on the client side.
</p><p>
As handy as it is to tunnel non-IP protocols and as ubiquitous as Windows
servers are, PPTP has one big problem. When Bruce Schneier and
Dr Mudge analyzed the Windows NT 4.0 implementation of PPTP in 1998,
they found serious security flaws that were only partially mitigated by
the release of MSCHAPv2 shortly afterward. MSCHAP is an authentication
protocol PPTP depends on; it was the source of the worst vulnerabilities
Schneier and Mudge found. Schneier has a Web page devoted to
their analysis (see Resources).
</p><p>
Schneier and Mudge analyzed Windows NT 4.0; what about a Linux PoPToP
server? According to the PoPToP Web site (in &ldquo;PoPToP Questions and
Answers&rdquo;): &ldquo;PoPToP suffers the same security vulnerabilities as the
NT sever (this is because it operates with Windows clients).&rdquo;
</p><p>
I do not recommend using PPTP unless you can configure your PPTP
server and all PPTP clients to use MSCHAPv2 (not all Windows versions
support MSCHAPv2) and you're trying to do something that simply
can't be done with IPSec. IPSec is much better designed and is provably
more secure. Furthermore, non-IP network protocols aren't as important as
they once were; both Windows and Novell Netware can do everything over IP.
</p><p>
I'll stop short of saying something like &ldquo;you can't use PPTP, because
it's lame.&rdquo; As I argued last month, security is about risk management,
not about seeking some sort of utopian state of pure security. After you
read up on the Schneier and Mudge controversy, Microsoft's response
and MSCHAPv2, and after you carefully examine your particular
organization's needs and capabilities, you conceivably could decide that
for you, PPTP represents a justifiable compromise between security and
functionality&mdash;just don't tell anyone <span   class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> said you should use it!
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b04580.0x1ff6698"></a>
Other Linux VPN Packages</h2></div></div><p>
Three other Linux VPN tools are worth mentioning here, because you'll
occasionally see references to them. Two of them I recommend against
using, and the third I'm not sure about.
</p><p>
CIPE and vtun conceptually are similar to OpenVPN. They encapsulate
traffic into encrypted UDP or TCP packets. Unlike OpenVPN, however,
they use homegrown cryptosystems rather than OpenSSL. That is, they
do use standard cryptographic algorithms such as Blowfish and MD5, but
in custom implementations (session-key generation, user authentication
and so on). Because implementation is one of the hardest parts of cryptographic
programming, this is a dangerous thing to do, and sure enough, the
cryptographer Peter Gutmann has found serious flaws in both CIPE and
vtun.
</p><p>
In neither case have the flaws Gutmann identified been fixed, as far as I
can tell. And neither CIPE nor vtun appears to be in active development
anymore (CIPE for sure is not), which is reason enough to avoid any
security application, except when that application is part of a Linux
distribution whose packagers provide patches themselves. I do not,
therefore, recommend using either CIPE or vtun.
</p><p>
tinc, like CIPE and vtun, uses a custom
cryptographic implementation to encapsulate VPN traffic in encrypted UDP
packets. And like those packages, Gutmann found flaws in tinc, in the
same analysis I referred to earlier. Unlike CIPE and vtun, however, tinc's
developers have responded to Gutmann's findings in a credible manner; at
least from my perspective (IANAC&mdash;that is, &ldquo;I am not a
cryptographer&rdquo;),
they appear to have some clue as to what they're doing.
</p><p>
I leave it to you to check out the tinc Web site, read Gutmann's page
(which stops well short of being a serious research report), do a few
Google searches for the aftermath of Gutmann's statements and decide for
yourself whether tinc looks like just the thing you've been looking for
or more like an unjustifiable risk given the availability and quality
of OpenS/WAN and OpenVPN.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b04580.0x1ff6958"></a>
SSL-VPN</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, a word about a popular new approach supported in many commercial
VPN products, SSL-VPN. SSL-VPN works in practically the same way as
Stunnel and SSH port forwarding. It tunnels network transactions on a
per-service, per-server basis rather than at the circuit level. Unlike
those other approaches, however, SSL-VPN products present end users
with a centralized Web interface in which all available servers/services
hosted by the VPN server are listed as hyperlinks. When the user clicks
on a link, typically a Java applet is downloaded that serves as the
application client software.
</p><p>
The SSL-VPN server products I've seen are all
proprietary, but because the client side is usually
cross-platform, in Java, Linux systems can act as
SSL-VPN clients.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1b04580.0x1ff6ab8"></a>
Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>
FreeS/WAN and OpenS/WAN (preferably the latter) and IPSec are probably
the most secure and powerful VPN tools in the Linux toolbox. OpenVPN
appears to be a simpler, albeit less-scrutinized, alternative. OpenSSH
and Stunnel provide handy point solutions when encapsulating more
than a few specific applications is overkill. Still other Linux VPN
tools are available, but some are provably dangerous, and on the others the
jury is still out.
Which VPN tool is the best fit for you? Obviously, I can't tell you that
without knowing your particular needs and resources. But, I hope this
little overview has at least given you a useful starting point.
