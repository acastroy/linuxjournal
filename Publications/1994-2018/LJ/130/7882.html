Buoyant Reading Material</h4><p>
Hello from Munich. This is one more in the long and
famous series of &ldquo;Man reading a newspaper on the Dead
Sea&rdquo;. The newspaper of course is special.
Hope you like it. I still like your magazine, it is
so refreshingly different from what we have here.

Learning select() Already?</h4><p>
My new 2.5-month-old twin daughters are already expressing an interest
in daddy's line of work. Here's little Kathryn studying up on her
Stevens so that she can write high-performance Linux socket code.

Photo of the Month: Love Is Pain</h4><p>
Hey, I am just sending this picture in to share. It
is a picture of the Tux tattoo I got on my back. In
the picture it's pretty red, but that's because the
picture was taken a few hours after it was done.
The tattoo artist said two seconds after he finished,
in his big burly voice, &ldquo;DUDE! It's cute!&rdquo; I
responded with, &ldquo;You mean it looks bad ass and
powerful?&rdquo; He laughed and I went home.

PowerPC, Please</h4><p>
I enjoy <i  >Linux Journal</i>. I would like some articles on PowerPC
Hardware, comparisons between Pentium and PowerPC
performance, how to build a PowerPC computer and info on
motherboards that can run Linux.
In particular, I want to build a fanless computer, and I
believe that the PowerPC might offer more performance
than a Pentium for a given power consumption.

Desktop Success</h4><p>
I'm an intermediate user of Linux, running two different
versions of Red Hat on two different machines. My only formal
training in computing was on Atari 800s and Windows 3.1 boxes. I use my
Linux boxes as desktop machines primarily, although I do run one as my
home server. In response to the letter in the December 2004 issue about failed
opportunities in the desktop world, I strongly disagree. I've taught
myself everything I know about Linux and have converted two of my best
friends to use it on their home desktops. I'm currently tutoring my
friend who works in small business providing technical support and
computers to home users and business clients. He's already installed two
different Linux machines into his home and is considering a Linux server
for a major client he works with. I thought I'd just say thank you
<i  >LJ</i>
for your indispensable aid in my learning process as well as that of my friends.
My next big Linux projects include getting my co-workers, parents and
grandparents to switch to Linux (wish me luck) and hacking my Xbox.

Which Distro?</h4><p>
As we all love Linux, it would be nice if you and other
staff members let us know about what distro you are using in
your computers.
I love <i  >LJ</i>. Good work.

Most of the editorial staff uses SuSE, but some
of us run Debian, Fedora or Gentoo. We're also
trying out a new one called Ubuntu, so watch for some
observations about that next issue.  &mdash;Ed.

Controversial Ads</h4><p>
Brian Proffitt of <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Today</em></span> is claiming that
<i  >Linux Journal</i> has run print ads for the Microsoft &ldquo;Get the
Facts&rdquo; campaign. I quote, &ldquo;<i  >Linux Journal</i> and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Magazine</em></span> have both run full-page print ads for the
Get the Facts campaign.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Is this true? I've subscribed to <i  >Linux Journal</i> for
years and have never seen such an ad. I have nothing
against Microsoft ads per se, but the so-called
&ldquo;Get the Facts&rdquo; campaign is just a load of crap.
Thanks for a great magazine.

<span   class="bold"><b>Our VP of Sales and Marketing Carlie Fairchild
responds:</b></span>
<i  >Linux Journal</i> has never in its history run an ad
for Microsoft. My position from day one has been
that when Microsoft has a product for the Linux
community, I will be more than happy to run its ad.
We request a copy of the ad they'd like to submit
each time they come to us looking to advertise.
Based on the content of that ad, and that alone, we
make our decision. To date, I've found their ads to be
counter-productive to our editorial and advertising
missions. We love our friends at <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Today</em></span> and
appreciate their struggle with this. I don't wish to
represent that our position is the only right one.
It's just what suits our mission best.
