How to network-boot a Linux box that has no
persistent storage and use it as a diskless X terminal.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1352580.0x144a2f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The X terminal is not a new idea; companies such as NCD have been
manufacturing them for 15 years or more. The thin
client idea fell out of fashion during the late 1990s, however, as the price of
PC hardware fell so low that there was no obvious cost advantage to
using X terminals. Heated arguments ensued over the total cost of
ownership (including both the cost of the hardware and
administrative support) of thin clients vs. PCs, and the debate will
not be resolved by this article. The objective here is simply to
describe a technique that allows one to utilize some of the growing
pile of obsolete hardware left in the wake of advancing PC technology
to build X terminals.
</p><p>
The essential characteristic of any thin client is that it should have
little or no persistent storage. Typically, a purpose-built X
terminal has a small quantity of NVRAM used to store
configuration options and nothing else. In practice, it usually
is possible to put even these options in a configuration file stored on
the server and downloaded by the terminal on boot. This article
takes the purist view that an X terminal should have no persistent
storage whatsoever.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1352580.0x144a450"></a>PXE Booting</h2></div></div><p>
The PC has no hard, floppy or CD-ROM drive, so some other
device must provide the bootloader and bootable image. X terminals
are creatures of the network they inhabit, so the obvious choice is
the network interface card (NIC). The NIC, therefore, must identify itself to the BIOS as a
bootable device. If chosen, it must be able to download the bootloader from the network. This is not something most run-of-the-mill
NICs can do. However, a standard for NIC boot ROMs called PXE
(Preboot eXecution Environment, pronounced pixie) has been
published by Intel and implemented by that company as well as by some other vendors in
some products. Many newer motherboards with built-in Ethernet have PXE
support.</p><p>
In preparing this article, I tested five
different kinds of NICs, all of which were advertised to support PXE:
the Intel PRO/100+ (PILA8460BNG1), the 3Com 3C905CX-TX-M, the D-Link
DFE-550TX, the Linksys LNE100TX and the SMC 1255TX (Tulip chipset).
Of these five, only the 3Com card worked right out of the box. I was
able to get a boot ROM separately for the SMC card, after which it
also worked. The other three cards all had conspicuous but vacant
sockets for boot ROMs, which were not shipped by default.
Caveat emptor.
</p><p>
When the PXE NIC is chosen by the motherboard BIOS as the boot device,
it broadcasts DHCP requests on the LAN and looks for PXE extensions in
the responses it receives. If it receives a response containing some
of these extensions, it then acknowledges and accepts the response.
In particular, it respects the next-server and filename
parameters in the server's response. These parameters specify the IP
address of a TFTP server and the name of the file containing a bootloader
that the client should download and start.

The Internet Software Consortium's version 3.0 DHCP server can be
configured to advertise PXE extensions, and it is the DHCP server
shipped with a number of Linux distributions, including Red Hat 8.0 and
later versions. Listing 1 is an example of a DHCP server configuration
file, dhcpd.conf, that generates DHCP responses with PXE extensions when the
DHCP client identifies itself as a PXE NIC. With this configuration,
the client downloads the file pxelinux.0 from the TFTP server, located
at 192.168.1.1. Table 1 lists the options set in the configuration file.

Obviously, the server at 192.168.1.1 must be configured to provide the
TFTP service. It also must have a bootloader image called pxelinux.0,
where the TFTP server process looks for it (usually in the
directory /tftpboot). The TFTP server process usually is managed by
one of the superservers, inetd or xinetd, so turning it on means
messing around with one of their configuration files (/etc/inetd.conf
or /etc/xinetd.conf, respectively).
</p><p>
The file pxelinux.0 is a bootloader that comes from H. Peter
Anvin's SYSLINUX Project. Unlike generic bootloaders, such as LILO or
GRUB, PXELINUX understands the PXE protocol and has the necessary
networking functionality to pick up the boot process at this point by
downloading the kernel and compressed RAM disk using TFTP. However,
PXELINUX requires an enhanced TFTP server, one that understands the
TSIZE option (RFC 2349). Fortunately, H. Peter Anvin also provides a
modified version of the standard BSD TFTP d&aelig;mon, called tftp-hpa, that
does support this option. The easiest thing to do is to replace the
standard TFTP d&aelig;mon, often located at /usr/sbin/in.tftpd, with
tftp-hpa.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1352580.0x144b160"></a>PXELINUX</h2></div></div><p>
PXELINUX knows where the PXE boot ROMs stashed the network parameters
from the DHCP server's response in memory, and it can use these to start
another TFTP session to download its configuration file from the
server. With the TFTP server configured as described above, the bootloader running on the client first tries to find its configuration
file in /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/<i>ethermac</i>, where
<i>ethermac</i>
represents the client's Ethernet hardware address in lowercase
hexadecimal, with octets separated by hyphens, for example,
fe-ed-de-ad-be-ef. Failing that, the bootloader tries
/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/<i>iphex</i>, where
<i>iphex</i> is the client's IP
address in uppercase hexadecimal. For example, if the client has the
IP address 192.168.0.12, PXELINUX would try to download the file
/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/C0A8000C. If that file doesn't exist, the
least significant nibble is dropped from the name and the process
repeats. Therefore, in the example above, after C0A8000C is not found,
PXELINUX tries C0A8000, then C0A800 and so on. This makes it possible to
have a single configuration file for an entire subnet, provided that
the subnet boundary is nibble-aligned.
</p><p>
Listing 2 shows the contents of a PXELINUX configuration file. The
first line gives the name of a file containing a compressed kernel
image to be downloaded&mdash;all paths are relative to /tftpboot on the
server. The second line lists parameters that should be passed to the
kernel specifying that the root filesystem be a 64MB RAM
disk that should be mounted read/write. The last line causes
PXELINUX to generate an additional kernel parameter containing
<tt  >ip=<i>client-ip</i>:<i>server-ip</i>:<i>gateway-ip</i>:<i>netmask</i></tt>
and using the values
obtained by the PXE boot ROMs from the DHCP server's response. This
is useful if the kernel was built with kernel-level
autoconfiguration of IP networking enabled. If so, when the kernel
boots it uses these parameters to configure the network interface,
making it unnecessary to do so using ifconfig or ifup in a startup
script.

In order to use kernel-level autoconfiguration of
IP parameters, the
network device driver must be available early in the boot, even
before the root filesystem is mounted. Therefore, it cannot be a
loadable module. Because the kernels that come with most distributions
use loadable modules extensively, in practice this means it is
necessary to build a custom kernel for the X terminal. In addition,
the custom kernel should support RAM disks and initial RAM disks.
Kernel-level autoconfiguration of IP networking is also
convenient. It is not necessary to include any of the dynamic
methods of obtaining IP addresses (DHCP, BOOTP and RARP can be
selected), however, as the IPAPPEND line included in the PXELINUX
configuration file ensures that the kernel receives the correct IP
parameters. Finally, device filesystem support with devfs mounted
automatically on boot greatly simplifies the /dev directory in the RAM
disk root filesystem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1352580.0x144b898"></a>RAM Disk Root Filesystem</h2></div></div><p>
Building and populating the root filesystem would be the most
complicated part of setting up a diskless Linux box if it weren't for
the advent of Richard Gooch's device filesystem and Erik Anderson's
BusyBox combined binary. The device filesystem automatically manages
the /dev directory, creating device entry points as needed for the
devices loaded in the kernel. This means two things:
the directory has no unnecessary entries, and builders of RAM disk
root filesystems don't have to spend hours with mknod trying to
create all the needed device entry points. The BusyBox combined
binary is an executable that changes its personality depending on how
it is invoked. The usual methodology is to create symlinks to
/bin/busybox from /bin/ls, /bin/cat, /bin/ps, /sbin/mount and so on,
to create a minimalist UNIX system. No additional libraries or
binaries are needed; the BusyBox rolls them into one.
</p><p>
One way to think of this setup is that the device filesystem takes care of
/dev; the BusyBox takes care of /bin and /sbin; the kernel takes care
of /proc; a read-only NFS mount takes care of /usr; and /tmp can be
empty. So, all you need to worry about is /etc. In fact, /etc
can be starkly minimalist, containing only /etc/fstab, /etc/inittab
and /etc/init.d/rcS, the latter being the single startup script used
by BusyBox when running as init.
</p><p>
BusyBox was written for the world of embedded Linux and normally
would be built as a static executable. However, the XFree86 server itself
depends on a number of shared libraries normally found in /lib. We
are going to NFS-mount /usr, so we don't have to worry about shared
libraries found in /usr/lib, but we do have to provide the ones
XFree86 expects to find in /lib. Therefore, we might as well take advantage of
the space savings made possible by configuring BusyBox as a dynamic
executable. The minimum libraries required in /lib to run XFree86 can
be discovered by running <tt  >ldd /usr/X11R6/bin/XFree86</tt>.
They are glibc
(libc.so and libm.so), PAM (libpam.so and libpam_misc.so) and the
dynamic loader itself (libdl.so and ld-linux.so).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1352580.0x144baa8"></a>Configuring XFree86</h2></div></div><p>
The XFree86 executable normally is found in /usr/X11R6/bin, a
subdirectory of /usr. We don't need to provide the X server in the
RAM disk then, but can take it from the NFS mount. Although the
modular XFree86 server itself has not been hardware-specific since
about version 4.0, its configuration file definitely is. If you are
managing several X terminals with different video hardware, it is
impossible to use the same XF86Config file for all of them.
Therefore, we prefer not to keep it in the RAM disk root filesystem,
where it usually would be found in /etc/X11/XF86Config. Instead, we
can use a per-terminal configuration file stored in the NFS /usr
directory. Ultimately, the BusyBox init process is configured to
respawn a shell script continuously containing the single line:


<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/X11R6/bin/XFree86 \
-xf86config /usr/X11R6/configs/<i>iphex</i> -query \
<i>server</i>
</pre>
</p><p>
where <i>iphex</i> is the client's IP address in hexadecimal (a naming
convention borrowed from PXELINUX) and <i>server</i> is the server's IP
address in dotted-decimal. With a few clever awk-on-/proc/cmdline
tricks, we can entirely avoid hard coding any hostnames or IP
addresses into the RAM disk image.
</p><p>
A basic XFree86 configuration file can be created by running <tt  >XFree86
-configure</tt> on the terminal. In general, this correctly
identifies
the video hardware, and the resulting configuration file loads the
appropriate XFree86 modules. It is worth mentioning, however, that the
default pointer device, /dev/mouse, generally doesn't exist on a system
using the device filesystem. For example, the PS/2 mouse is found at
/dev/misc/psaux instead.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1352580.0x1442700"></a>Server-Side Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
The part that makes the X terminal an X terminal instead of a
Linux box with a graphical display is the <tt  >-query
<i>server</i></tt> part of
the XFree86 command line above. This causes the XFree86 server on the
terminal to run an XDMCP (X Display Manager Control Protocol) session
to try to get the server to manage its display. However, not every
server is going to agree to do so.
</p><p>
First, and most obviously, the server must be listening for incoming
XDMCP connections. XDMCP is normally on UDP port 177, and most
display managers (xdm, gdm, kdm) can be configured to listen for XDMCP
requests. Although most distributions are configured to run a display
manager on bootup, most do not listen for incoming XDMCP requests due
to security considerations. For example, the classic X display
manager, xdm, usually is distributed with the line:

<pre     class="programlisting">

DisplayManager.requestPort: 0

</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1352580.0x1442968"></a></h2></div></div><p>
in its configuration file (commonly /etc/X11/xdm/xdm-config). This
would have to be commented out in order for xdm to accept XDMCP
requests. In addition, xdm can be configured to restrict itself to
connections on a per-host or per-subnet basis using the configuration
file /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess (don't be confused by /etc/X11/xdm/Xservers,
which is largely a historical relic). For example, to restrict xdm
to terminals in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet, add a line containing
only 192.168.1.0/24 to the end of /etc/X11/xdm/Xaccess.
</p><p>
In addition, it can be convenient if the server also provides
fonts to the terminals, by way of the X font server process xfs. Once
again, although most distributions run a font server process, it
usually is configured not to listen for incoming requests. For example,
the configuration file for xfs, /etc/X11/fs/config, generally
contains the line <tt  >no-listen = tcp</tt>. If this is commented out,
the Files section of the terminal's XF86Config file (stored in
/usr/X11R6/configs/<i>iphex</i> on the server) can contain only one
FontPath instead of the usual half-dozen, as shown in Listing 3
(where a server IP of 192.168.1.1 is assumed).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1352580.0x1442b78"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Listing 3. Terminal XF86Config Fragment

        FontPath     "tcp/192.168.1.1:7100"
EndSection

</pre></div><p>
Finally, the server must be configured to NFS export its /usr
filesystem read-only to the terminal, as this is where the terminal
gets the XFree86 server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1352580.0x1442d88"></a>Some Words about Security</h2></div></div><p>
A number of security considerations should be kept in mind when
running X terminals. First, it should be fairly obvious that the
changes made to the xdm and xfs configurations are undoing things that
were done to increase the security of the server. Furthermore, the
setup described in this article does not encrypt any traffic.
Every
keystroke on the terminal goes over the network
unencrypted. The only reasonably safe way to run with X
terminals is to put them all on a private LAN that is used only by X
terminals and that does not route to the Internet. The terminals and
one interface on the server should be the only ones on the terminal
LAN.

Due to the space limitations of printed media, this article presented
a high-level view of how to configure a Linux box to boot diskless and
become an X terminal, without going into great detail about the
precise implementation. Interested readers are encouraged to download
the X Terminal Kit from the author's Web site; it includes shell
scripts, Makefiles and READMEs to guide you through the sometimes
complicated process. In addition, the software described in this
article has been drawn from numerous resources on the Internet,
all of which have more detailed information about their particular
packages. See the on-line Resources for pointers.
