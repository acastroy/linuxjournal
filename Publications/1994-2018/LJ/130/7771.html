Full-text and metadata search is no pipe dream. You
can make it happen today with this
library that searches for files based on content or many
other helpful attributes.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6c580.0xd64298"></a></h2></div></div><p>
The libferris Project began in early 2001 in order to create a
virtual filesystem operating as a shared library. Many tree-like
structures are presented through a single filesystem interface by
libferris. Operating in the user address space instead of in the kernel
allows libferris to expose a large number of tree-like sources. These
sources
would be difficult to access from the Linux kernel. All filesystems
are accessible through the root:// URI in libferris and include kernel
file:// URLs, relational databases, XML files and databases, network-accessible resources like HTTP/FTP servers and other composite files
like db4, tarballs and RDF, as well as standard kernel filesystems
like ext3 and XFS.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6c580.0xd643a0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Why libferris?
</b></p><p>
Here's why you
might choose libferris for filesystem indexing and querying:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Plugins can extract text that is trapped in files for full-text
indexing.
</p></li><li><p>
Unified interface for all data sources used as input for indexing&mdash;for example, the following are all indexable with libferris:
text inside SleepyCat dbxml files, inside tarballs and in individual
messages in mbox files or relational databases.
</p></li><li><p>
Metadata trapped inside files can be indexed and searched for.
For example, the ID3 tags for audio files can be indexed to provide
search-by-artist functionality.
</p></li><li><p>
Identical basic add/query commands for all indexing plugins, so you can
switch between indexing implementations fairly easily.
</p></li><li><p>
Combination searches for full-text and extended attributes for your
filesystem. The ferris-search tool allows you to combine many searches
into one result set.
</p></li><li><p>
Ability to search for files based on the metadata they once had.
</p></li><li><p>
Ability to search for files based on Supervised Machine Learning (SML)
judgments&mdash;spam filtering for your filesystem. Unfortunately, covering
SML is beyond the scope of this article.
</p></li></ul></div></div><p>
The notion of files and directories is merged in libferris into a
single abstraction. This allows things like tar archives to be
mounted as a filesystem implicitly by libferris. In this case, the
tarball is both a file and a directory at the same time.
</p><p>
The extended attribute (EA) interface presents data from many sources,
including the kernel's listxattr(2) interface, RDF/bdb repositories
and dynamically extracted values. An example of a dynamic EA is the
width of an image. When an image's width EA is read, libferris uses a
plugin to determine the width of the image file.
Another example is the sample rate for audio files.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0xc6c580.0xd64b30"></a><p class="title"><b>

More EAs and their descriptions are listed on the
libferris Web site (see the on-line Resources).
</p><p>
This leads to two distinct types of indexes
that libferris can create and query&mdash;full-text and EA.
Full-text indexes allow you to find files based on the words that they
contain. EA indexes allow you to find files based on the metadata for
the file. The indexing structures needed to resolve queries against
full text or EA are significantly different. For example, full-text
indexes may store the list of documents containing each word (an
inverted file) to resolve queries such as &ldquo;find all documents
containing the word libferris&rdquo;. EA indexes need to be able to handle
range queries such as &ldquo;find all files modified last month&rdquo;.
</p><p>
libferris uses plugins to handle the implementation of these indexes.
For full-text indexes, you can use any or all of these: an internal
format based on inverted files, Apache Lucene compiled with gcj, an
ODBC supporting relational database, Xapian or the TSearch2 module in
PostgreSQL. For EA indexes you can choose an internal design based on
sorted inverted files, LDAP, Apache Lucene compiled with gcj, an ODBC
supporting relational database or native PostgreSQL using some PGSQL.
The recommended choices for general use are Xapian or TSearch2 for
full text, and PostgreSQL or ODBC for EA indexes.
</p><p>
The PostgreSQL modules are similar to those of the ODBC, but they use PGSQL and
other PostgreSQL-specific functionality. Using the PostgreSQL TSearch2
plugin for full text requires a template database to be set up on your
PostgreSQL server. See the on-line Resources for details.
</p><p>
All indexes exist in their own directory in libferris.
Default full-text and EA indexes are in ~/.ferris in full-text-index and
ea-index, respectively. Indexes are created with either fcreate or
gfcreate from the ferriscreate package. Like many tools in libferris,
the gf prefixed tool does much the same thing as the f prefixed
tool, but it offers a GTK+2 interface. The following sections describe
creation, population and querying of both index types.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6c580.0xd65738"></a>
Full-Text Indexing</h2></div></div><p>
Jumping right in, I first create a full-text index in /tmp, add some
files to it and then query for files using the index. First, I create a
directory for the new index and use gfcreate to set up
the new index in that directory:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ mkdir /tmp/text-index
$ gfcreate /tmp/text-index
</pre>
</p><p>
The GUI for gfcreate shows the major MIME types in the leftmost tab,
with a misc tab for things that can be created and that are considered
distinct from MIME. After selecting misc, all the available index formats
are shown in a second level of tabs. In Figure 1,
I've chosen to create a Xapian full-text index using English
for word stemming and ignoring word case.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="7771f1.large.jpg"><img src="7771f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Making a Xapian Full-Text Index with
gfcreate
</p></div></div><p>
When adding files to the full-text index, libferris attempts to use
the as-text EA to obtain a textual representation of the file. Many
plugins have been created supporting the as-text EA; PDF files, HTML
files, man pages and djvu images all support as-text.
</p><p>
The findexadd and findexquery tools can be told which index to use
with the -P command-line option. The following uses a PDF file and man
page from the Samba 3.0.3 package as example input. As paths will vary
depending on your Linux distribution, prefixes to the files have been
replaced with /.../:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ findexadd -P /tmp/text-index \
/.../samba-3.0.3/docs/Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf
$ findexquery -P /tmp/text-index samba
ID 1 99% [file://.../Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf]
Found 1 matches at the following locations:
file://.../Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf

$ findexadd -P /tmp/text-index /.../samba.7.gz
$ findexquery -P /tmp/text-index smbstatus
ID 1 100% [file://.../Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf]
ID 5 93% [file://.../samba.7.gz]
Found 2 matches at the following locations:
file://.../Samba-HOWTO-Collection.pdf
file://.../samba.7.gz

</pre>
</p><p>
The most interesting options for findexquery are the -P for setting the
path to the index, the --ranked option for performing ranked full-text queries
and --xapian for passing raw Xapian format queries to the back end (see
Resources).
</p><p>
The default query format is Boolean. In this format, all alphanumeric
words are looked up in the index and there are four Boolean operators
that are used infix. These are &amp; (and), | (or), ! (not) and
- (minus). Ranked mode combines all terms and returns a list of
documents that are the most interesting based on your query. In
Xapian format, libferris hands the query directly to the back end for
processing; currently, only the Xapian back end can handle such queries.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6c580.0xd65c60"></a>
EA Indexing</h2></div></div><p>
The procedure for adding to and querying EA indexes closely follows
that of full-text indexing. EA indexes use the feaindexadd and
feaindexquery commands, which both accept the -P /path-to-index option.
</p><p>
There are three parameters for overall tuning of EA indexes. These can
be set when the EA index is created. They relate to the EA you are
interested in indexing for your files. For example, you can create a
lean EA index containing only filenames, sizes and some image
properties for use in image file searching. You also may choose to
ignore some EAs that take a while to calculate or that are not relevant
to your search. For example, if you are not planning to use
the index for integrity checking, ignoring the MD5, SHA-1 and
other checksums saves considerable time, because these checksums
require the entire file to be read for each file being added to the
index.
</p><p>
The first of the general EA index parameters is the
max-values-size-to-index parameter that defines the largest byte
length for a value to be added to the index for any attribute.
Most EAs should be fairly short values in the range of less than 100
bytes. The default is to be lenient and allow up to 1,024 bytes to be
used by any individual EA value. The other two attributes are
attributes-not-to-index and attributes-not-to-index-regex. These
define the names of EAs to be ignored when files are being
added to the index. There is a direct trade-off between indexing all
EAs, which makes adding files slower but preserves all information for
queries or indexing only a subset of EAs, which makes the adding faster but
then some queries will not execute.
</p><p>
The defaults for the not-to-index parameters should allow files to
be added fairly quickly but still allow many interesting
EAs to be indexed. These defaults for these three parameters can be
overridden by running the cc/capplets/index/ferris-capplet-index tool, which
sets the defaults for new index creation and alters your
~/.ferris indexes for future file indexing.
</p><p>
For the EA index we use a PostgreSQL database to store the index.
For seamless EA index creation, a minor setup step is required
before running the fcreate tools.
The PGSQL language must be enabled by default for new databases.
The command below does this when run as root:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# createlang -d template1 plpgsql
</pre>
</p><p>
If you don't want to change the template1 database, you can create
the PostgreSQL database manually, enable plpgsql for the new database and append
db-exists=1 to the fcreate command line below.
</p><p>
For PostgreSQL EA indexes, you also can set the user name, password,
host, port and dbname for use by the PostgreSQL database. By default
(db-exists=0) the database with name dbname must not exist and will be
created for this new EA index.
</p><p>
There is another tweakable parameter for EA indexes that use a
relational database as their implementation, allowing you to change
how some EAs are normalized in the relational database. Once again,
the default values should be acceptable. I explain this trade-off in a moment.
</p><p>
The extra-columns-to-inline-in-docmap gives a list of EAs that are so
important to searching they should be denormalized into the
docmap table. EAs that have a unique value for
almost every file will be stored more efficiently inline in the docmap
table. To denormalize an EA in this way, you must provide the SQL
type for that EA as well.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6c580.0xd5c910"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Normalization of EA in a Relational Database
</b></p><p>
To resolve a query on a normalized EA,
four tables are involved. The docmap table stores
the file's URL and a synthetic integral key, the
docid. The attrmap table stores the name of an EA and
assigns a synthetic integral key, the attrid. One of
many valuemap tables are used, depending on the type
of the value, but they all follow a similar style.
For example, strlookup assigns varchar values a
synthetic integral key, the vid. And finally, a join
table, docattrs, joins a docid with an attrid and a
vid to record that a file has an attribute with a
given value. Thus, to resolve a query (width&lt;=800)
if the width EA is normalized requires looking
up the attrid and vid to join in the docattrs
table, producing a list of docids that have a width
satisfying the query.
</p><p>
Normalized EAs are stored directly into the docmap table as a
column. To resolve the width query above, the relational database index
on the docmap.width column is used to find the matching docids
directly. This normalization is a space-time trade-off. Generally, for
EAs for which you are planning to search often, you would consider
inlining them. Many EAs that are not part of a stat(2) call or
deemed very interesting should be left indexed in the attrmap, valuemap
and docattrs tables.
</p></div><p>
For this example, I use my user name and a dbname of lj. The second
command below creates the EA index using the non-interactive
fcreate tool. The third command then adds all the JPEG files in
my shared image directory to that index. You also can use
feaindexadd with the -d option to list file paths explicitly
on the command line. Without -d, feaindexadd tries to recurse into
the paths you supply:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ mkdir /tmp/ea-index
$ fcreate --create-type=eaindexpostgresql \
--target-path=/tmp/ea-index dbname=lj user=ben
# if you have setup new db, append  db-exists=1
$ find /usr/share/backgrounds/images \
-name "*.jpg" \
| feaindexadd -P /tmp/ea-index --filelist-stdin

</pre>
</p><p>
My image directory contains 42 JPEG images. Here, I query the index:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ feaindexquery -P /tmp/ea-index '(width&gt;=640)'
Found 34 matches at the following locations:
file:///usr/share/backgrounds/images/dewdop_leaf.jpg
...
$ feaindexquery -P /tmp/ea-index '(size&gt;=100k)'
Found 42 matches at the following locations:
file:///usr/share/backgrounds/images/dewdop_leaf.jpg
...
$ feaindexquery -P /tmp/ea-index \
'(&amp;(width&lt;=800)(size&gt;=100k))'
Found 19 matches at the following locations:
file:///usr/.../images/space/apollo08_earthrise.jpg
...

</pre>
</p><p>
The EA index query syntax is based on &ldquo;The String
Representation of LDAP Search Filters&rdquo; as described in RFC 2254. This
is a simple syntax, providing a small set of comparative
operators to make lvalue operator rvalue terms and a means to
combine these terms with Boolean and (&amp;), or (|) and not (!)
operations. All terms are contained in parentheses, with operators
preceding their arguments. The operators are kept simple: == for
equality, &lt;= and &gt;= for value ranges and =~ for regex matches.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc6c580.0xd5cd30"></a>
Searching by Memory</h2></div></div><p>
The ODBC (optionally) and PostgreSQL (always) EA indexing plugins
allow you to store many versions of EAs for a file in the index. Having
many versions of metadata for a file allows you to query for files
based on the EA values those files once had.
</p><p>
To use this functionality, you have to select a time range to match the search
against when querying by using a special EA. The time-restricting EAs
are atime, ferris-current-time, multiversion-mtime and multiversion-atime.
The last two EAs match against the mtime and atime for the file you
are seeking.
The ferris-current-time EA for a version of a file's index data is the
time when that file was being indexed.
If no time range is
selected, only the latest version of metadata for each file is
considered when executing a query.
</p><p>
Time restrictions can be given as a string, and libferris tries its
best to work out the format of your time string. In the
tests/timeparsing directory of the libferris distribution
is a timeparse tool that accepts time values and tells you what
libferris makes of your time string. More details on the permissible
time strings are given in the libferris FAQ item (see Resources).
</p><p>
The following example of a time-based query looks for all image
files that were indexed over a year ago with a given width range:

<pre     class="programlisting">

$ feaindexquery -P /tmp/ea-index \
 '(&amp;(width&gt;=1600)(ferris-current-time&lt;=1 year ago))'

</pre>
</p><p>
If a large image file was indexed two years ago and
subsequently replaced with a thumbnail image and re-indexed,
the above query returns the file. This is because one of its versions of
metadata matches the given query.
</p><p>
Handling the time restriction for EA queries by using the same
interface as querying on EA values allows you to use all the standard
query mechanisms to select your matching time range. For example, I
could select documents that were indexed in 2003 with a given width or
those with a specific owner that were modified in the last month:

<pre     class="programlisting">


## note, all one line
$ feaindexquery -P /tmp/ea-index '
(|
  (&amp;
    (width&gt;=1600)(ferris-current-time&gt;=begin 2003)
    (ferris-current-time&lt;=end 2003)
  )
  (&amp;
    (owner-name==sarusama)
    (multiversion-mtime&gt;=end last month)
  )
)

</pre>

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Hopefully, I've conveyed enough of the information on what libferris
has to offer in terms of its current implementations for both EA and
full-text indexing to raise your interest. The current implementation is
a necessary stepping-stone toward the goal of a more formalized
semantic filesystem query and browse interaction style.
