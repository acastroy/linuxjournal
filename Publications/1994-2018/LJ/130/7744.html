Programs, the kernel and even your phone can keep you
in touch and make the whole desktop work the way you
want. Here's how D-BUS works, and how applications
are using it.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22da580.0x23d22f0"></a></h2></div></div><p>
D-BUS is an interprocess communication (IPC) system, providing a simple
yet powerful mechanism allowing applications to talk to one another,
communicate information and request services. D-BUS was designed from
scratch to fulfill the needs of a modern Linux system. D-BUS' initial
goal is to be a replacement for CORBA and DCOP, the remote object systems
used in GNOME and KDE, respectively. Ideally, D-BUS can become a unified
and agnostic IPC mechanism used by both desktops, satisfying their needs
and ushering in new features.
</p><p>
D-BUS, as a full-featured IPC and object system,
has several intended uses. First, D-BUS can perform
basic application IPC, allowing one process to
shuttle data to another&mdash;think UNIX domain sockets on
steroids. Second, D-BUS can facilitate sending events,
or signals, through the system, allowing different
components in the system to communicate and ultimately
to integrate better. For example, a Bluetooth d&aelig;mon
can send an incoming call signal that your music
player can intercept, muting the volume until the
call ends. Finally, D-BUS implements a remote object
system, letting one application request services and
invoke methods from a different object&mdash;think CORBA
without the complications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22da580.0x23d2450"></a>
Why D-BUS Is Unique</h2></div></div><p>
D-BUS is unique from other IPC mechanisms in several ways. First,
the basic unit of IPC in D-BUS is a message, not a byte stream. In this
manner, D-BUS breaks up IPC into discrete messages, complete with headers
(metadata) and a payload (the data). The message format is binary,
typed, fully aligned and simple. It is an inherent part of the wire
protocol. This approach contrasts with other IPC mechanisms where the
lingua franca is a random stream of bytes, not a discrete message.
</p><p>
Second, D-BUS is bus-based. The simplest form of communication is
process to process. D-BUS, however, provides a d&aelig;mon, known as the
message bus d&aelig;mon, that routes messages between processes on a specific
bus. In this fashion, a bus topology is formed, allowing processes to
speak to one or more applications at the same time. Applications
can send to or listen for various events on the bus.
</p><p>
A final unique feature is the creation of not one but two of these
buses,
the system bus and the session bus. The system bus is global, system-wide
and runs at the system level. All users of the system can communicate
over this bus with the proper permissions, allowing the concept of
system-wide events. The session bus, however, is created during user
login and runs at the user, or session, level. This bus is used solely
by a particular user, in a particular login session, as an IPC and remote
object system for the user's applications.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22da580.0x23d2608"></a>
D-BUS Concepts</h2></div></div><p>
Messages are sent to objects. Objects are addressed using path names,
such as /org/cups/printers/queue. Processes on the message bus are
associated with objects and implemented interfaces on that object.
</p><p>
D-BUS supports multiple message types, such as signals, method calls,
method returns and error messages. Signals are notification that a
specific event has occurred. They are simple, asynchronous, one-way
heads-up messages. Method call messages allow an application to request
the invocation of a method on a remote object. Method return messages
provide the return value resulting from a method invocation. Error
messages provide exceptions in response to a method invocation.
</p><p>
D-BUS is fully typed and type-safe. Both a message's header and payload
are fully typed. Valid types include byte, Boolean, 32-bit integer,
32-bit unsigned integer, 64-bit integer, 64-bit unsigned integer,
double-precision floating point and string. A special array type allows
for the grouping of types. A DICT type allows for dictionary-style
key/value pairs.
</p><p>
D-BUS is secure. It implements a simple protocol based on SASL profiles
for authenticating one-to-one connections. On a bus-wide level, the
reading of and the writing to messages from a specific interface are
controlled by a security system. An administrator can control access to
any interface on the bus. The D-BUS d&aelig;mon was written from the
ground up with security
in mind.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22da580.0x23d2818"></a>
Why D-BUS?</h2></div></div><p>
These concepts make nice talk, but what is the benefit? First, the
system-wide message bus is a new concept. A single bus shared by the
entire system allows for propagation of events, from the
kernel (see The Kernel Event Layer sidebar) to the uppermost
applications on the system. Linux, with its well-defined interfaces
and clear separation of layers, is not very integrated.
D-BUS' system message bus improves integration
without compromising fine engineering practices. Now, events such as disk
full and printer queue empty or even
battery power low can bubble
up the system stack, available for whatever application cares, allowing
the system to respond and react. The events are sent asynchronously,
and without polling.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22da580.0x23d2920"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
The Kernel Event Layer
</b></p><p>
The Kernel Event Layer is a kernel-to-user communication mechanism that
uses a high-speed netlink socket to communicate asynchronously with
user space. This mechanism can be tied into D-BUS, allowing the kernel
to send D-BUS signals!
</p><p>
The Kernel Event Layer is tied to sysfs, the tree of kobjects that lives
at
/sys on modern Linux systems. Each directory in sysfs is tied to
a kobject, which is a structure in the kernel used to represent objects;
sysfs is an object hierarchy exported as a filesystem.
</p><p>
Each Kernel Event Layer event is modeled as though it originated from a sysfs
path. Thus, the events appear as if they emit from kobjects. The
sysfs
paths are easily translatable to D-BUS paths, making the Kernel Event
Layer
and D-BUS a natural fit.
This Kernel Event Layer was merged into the 2.6.10-rc1 kernel.
</p></div><p>
Second, the session bus provides a mechanism for IPC and remote method
invocation, possibly providing a unified system between GNOME and
KDE. D-BUS aims to be a better CORBA than CORBA and a better DCOP than
DCOP, satisfying the needs of both projects while providing additional
features.
</p><p>
And, D-BUS does all this while remaining simple and efficient.

Adding D-BUS Support to Your Application</h2></div></div><p>
The core D-BUS API, written in C, is rather low-level and large. On
top of this API, bindings integrate
with programming languages and environments, including Glib,
Python, Qt and Mono. On top of providing language wrappers, the bindings
provide environment-specific features. For example, the Glib bindings
treat D-BUS connections as GObjects and allow messaging to integrate
into the Glib mainloop. The preferred use of D-BUS is definitely using
language and environment-specific bindings, both for ease of use and
improved functionality.
</p><p>
Let's look at some basic uses of D-BUS in your application. We
first look at the C API and then poke at some D-BUS code using the
Glib interface.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22da580.0x23d2d98"></a>
The D-BUS C API</h2></div></div><p>
Using D-BUS starts with including its header:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;dbus/dbus.h&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
The first thing you probably want to do is connect to an existing
bus. Recall from our initial D-BUS discussion that D-BUS provides two
buses, the session and the system bus. Let's connect to the system bus:

<pre     class="programlisting">

DBusError error;
DBusConnection *conn;

dbus_error_init (&amp;error);
conn = dbus_bus_get (DBUS_BUS_SYSTEM, &amp;error);
if (!conn) {
    fprintf (stderr, "%s: %s\n",
             err.name, err.message);
    return 1;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Connecting to the system bus is a nice first step, but we want to be
able to send messages from a well-known address. Let's acquire a service:

<pre     class="programlisting">

dbus_bus_acquire_service (conn, "org.pirate.parrot",
                          0, &amp;err);
if (dbus_error_is_set (&amp;err)) {
    fprintf (stderr, "%s: %s\n",
             err.name, err.message);
    dbus_connection_disconnect (conn);
    return;
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Now that we are on the system bus and have acquired the
org.pirate.parrot service, we can send messages originating from
that address. Let's send a signal:

<pre     class="programlisting">

DBusMessage *msg;
DBusMessageIter iter;

/* create a new message of type signal */
msg = dbus_message_new_signal(
          "org/pirate/parrot/attr",
          "org.pirate.parrot.attr", "Feathers");

/* build the signal's payload up */
dbus_message_iter_init (msg, &amp;iter);
dbus_message_iter_append_string (&amp;iter, "Shiny");
dbus_message_iter_append_string (&amp;iter,
                                 "Well Groomed");

/* send the message */
if (!dbus_connection_send (conn, msg, NULL))
        fprintf (stderr, "error sending message\n");

/* drop the reference count on the message */
dbus_message_unref (msg);

/* flush the connection buffer */
dbus_connection_flush (conn);

</pre>
</p><p>
This sends the Feathers signal from
org.pirate.parrot.attr with a payload consisting of two fields,
each strings: Shiny and Well Groomed. Anyone listening on
the system message bus with sufficient permissions can subscribe to this
service and listen for the signal.
</p><p>
Disconnecting from the system message bus is a single function:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if (conn)
        dbus_connection_disconnect (conn);
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22da580.0x23d3210"></a>
The Glib Bindings</h2></div></div><p>
Glib (pronounced gee-lib) is the base library of GNOME. It is on top
of Glib that Gtk+ (GNOME's GUI API) and the rest of GNOME is built. Glib
provides several convenience functions, portability wrappers, a family
of string functions and a complete object and type system&mdash;all in C.
</p><p>
The Glib library provides an object system and a mainloop, making
object-based, event-driven programming possible, even in C. The D-BUS
Glib bindings take advantage of these features. First, we want to
include the right header files:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#include &lt;dbus/dbus.h&gt;
#include &lt;dbus/dbus-glib.h&gt;

</pre>
</p><p>
Connecting to a specific message bus with the Glib bindings is easy:

<pre     class="programlisting">

DBusGConnection *conn;
GError *err = NULL;

conn = dbus_g_bus_get (DBUS_BUS_SESSION, &amp;err);
if (!conn) {
        g_printerr ("Error: %s\n", error-&gt;message);
        g_error_free (error);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, we connected to the per-user session bus. This call
associates the connection with the Glib mainloop, allowing multiplexed
I/O with the D-BUS messages.
</p><p>
The Glib bindings use the concept of proxy objects to represent
instantiations of D-BUS connections associated with specific services. The
proxy object is created with a single call:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DBusGProxy *proxy;

proxy = dbus_g_proxy_new_for_service (conn,
                                  "org.fruit.apple",
                                  "org/fruit/apple",
                                  "org.fruit.apple");
</pre>
</p><p>
This time, instead of sending a signal, let's execute a remote method
call. This is done using two functions. The first function invokes the
remote method; the second retrieves the return value.
</p><p>
First, let's invoke the Peel remote method:

<pre     class="programlisting">
DBusGPendingCall *call;

call = dbus_g_proxy_begin_call (proxy,
                    "Peel", DBUS_TYPE_INVALID);
</pre>
</p><p>
Now let's retrieve-check for errors and retrieve the results of the
method call:

<pre     class="programlisting">

GError *err = NULL;
int ret;

if (!dbus_g_proxy_end_call (proxy, call,
                          &amp;err, DBUS_TYPE_INT32,
                          &amp;ret, DBUS_TYPE_INVALID)) {
        g_printerr ("Error: %s\n", err-&gt;message);
        g_error_free (err);
}

</pre>
</p><p>
The Peel function accepts a single parameter,
an integer. If this call returned nonzero, it succeeded, and the variable
ret holds the return value from this function. The data
types that a specific method accepts are determined by the remote method.
For example, we
could not have passed DBUS_TYPE_STRING instead of
DBUS_TYPE_INT32.
</p><p>
The main benefit of the Glib bindings
is mainloop integration, allowing developers to manage multiple D-BUS
messages intertwined with other I/O and UI events. The header file
&lt;dbus/dbus-glib.h&gt; declares multiple functions for connecting
D-BUS to the Glib mainloop.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
D-BUS is a powerful yet simple IPC system that will improve, with luck,
the integration and functionality of Linux systems. Users are encouraged
to investigate new D-BUS utilizing applications. With this article
in hand, D-BUS shouldn't be a scary new dependency, but a shining new
feature. The on-line Resources list some interesting
applications that use D-BUS. Developers are encouraged to investigate implementing
D-BUS support in their applications. There are also
some Web sites that provide more information on using D-BUS. Of course, the best
reference is existing code, and thankfully there is plenty of that.
