<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> So Kyle, I hear you've got a shiny new wireless phone. What'd you get?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Well, after reviewing a Nokia N900 for a few months, when it was time to give
it back, I decided to buy one of my own [see Kyle's review of the Nokia
N900 in the May 2010 issue of <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>].
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Wow, you picked that over a BlackBerry, Droid or iPhone?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Yeah. Honestly, I was looking for more of a
portable Linux computer and less of a
smartphone. Because I wanted Linux, the iPhone and Blackberry were out of the
equation, so that left me with a choice between the Droid and the
N900. How many phones are
you carrying around these days?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Just two&mdash;one personal and one work-assigned. I try to keep a good work/home
separation these days. You're running two phones as well, from what I remember.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Between the Droid and the N900, the hardware was mostly the same (same
processor, hardware keyboard and so on), so it came down to the OS. In my opinion,
Maemo was just more open and hackable out of the box than Android. Plus, all
the apps for Android are written in a custom version of Java. Also, on Android, if
you really want to own the device, you have to run unauthorized firmware that relies
on exploits just to get root. On Maemo, root is easy to get out of the box without
voiding any warranties or getting any C&amp;D letters in the mail.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Yeah, well, those pesky cellular carriers don't like modified devices mucking
about on their networks.
</p><p>
In my experience, Android isn't quite like the Linux we use on our laptops.
Android is far more integrated and streamlined. For instance, there's no X server.
And thanks to your&mdash;I'll use the word &ldquo;distaste&rdquo;&mdash;of all things Java, you
decided to go with the Maemo-powered N900. How do you like it so far?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I have to admit, I've been pretty pleased with it so far. I think Maemo is
about as close to a regular Linux distribution that you'll get on a portable device
that still has lots of the features of some of the shinier smartphones. Speaking of
shiny, last I heard you were still on the iPhone bandwagon.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Oooh, shiny....
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> So, why no Android or Maemo device in your pocket?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Practicality. I got my iPhone 3GS last year,
and the only Android device then was
the T-Mobile G1, which is on the wrong network, and there was no Maemo device at
the time. Like all things Apple, the experience hasn't been all that bad.
</p><p>
It's like driving a BMW. You can't open the
hood and change the oil because
only the dealer can do that, but you can cruise down the road at 80 MPH, snubbing your
nose at the folks who don't have the nice ride and air conditioning you have.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Thanks for the car analogy, by the way, you know how I love those. Since you
did bring up the car analogy though, I thought we Linux users didn't want our hoods
welded shut? Since you got it, there have been a few different devices to come out
with similar hardware but with either Android or Maemo, so why not switch?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Well, for one, I'm not made of money. $300 for the iPhone last year, and then
another $500 for an unlocked Maemo device is just a little too much for my CFO at
home to handle. And, you're welcome on the analogy. I know how much you love those.
Although the hood may be welded shut, you <span   class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> pop the hood if you know how (via
jailbreak). And yes, my phone is jailbroken.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> See, that's the deal-breaker for me both on
the iPhone and on Android devices.
I don't think I should have to jailbreak anything
to run what I want on it. If you
truly own the device, you should be able to install your own software.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Another reason why I've stuck with the iPhone to date is that we have a
stable of iDevices around here. I swear, the things have procreated overnight.
Kelly's also running an iPhone, my daughter's got an iPod Touch, and my son has a
jailbroken first-generation iPhone without a SIM. All apps we buy can land on all the
devices because they are associated with the same iTunes account. I know, the next
thing you're going to bring up is &ldquo;walled garden&rdquo;! Although I get the whole freedom
argument, sometimes it's nice to have things that &ldquo;just work&rdquo;. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> And, every app is now tied to those devices, so even if you did want to switch
to a different OS, you'd have to face throwing that money you spent away.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> That's true, but things just work. That happens with any installed base of
commercial software, by the way.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I mean, it's a nice way to make sure you stick with a particular vendor, but
again, it seems to fly in the face of what we stand for as longtime Linux users.
It sounds like if it just worked, you wouldn't have to jailbreak your device, now
would you?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Hey, you're making a moral argument out of this. This is a practical thing.
After a day of hacking on servers and toiling in the data center, the last thing I
want to do is mess around on my daughter's handheld device.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Every geek I see with an iPhone seems to have a jailbroken one, so basically
to get to this magical &ldquo;just works&rdquo; state, people have to take their expensive
portable computer out of warranty. Anyway, nothing says I have to hack my N900. You
certainly can get plenty of use out of everything it offers by default. It just has
a whole other world of options open to you if you do want to tinker, just like any
other regular Linux install.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> To bring up another car analogy, my dad has been a mechanic forever. Yet my
mom's car, and his truck, are relatively new and covered by warranty. Why? Because
although he can build a kick-butt vehicle out of junk, he simply doesn't
<span   class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> to. He
can just hand the keys to someone and say &ldquo;fix it&rdquo;. He has the option to open the
hood, just like I do with my jailbreak, but he doesn't have to.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Not another car analogy.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Yes, another car analogy&mdash;cause you
know I'm all about that.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> You don't have to open the hood with the N900 either. There's a whole set of
default applications, plus many more are available with the standard application
manager.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I have an N800 Maemo device, and I had to tinker a lot with it to get it
where I wanted.
</p><p>
Do you get root right out of the box? I don't think you do.
You have to install gainroot, I believe.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> All you have to do is install one extra
program called rootsh, and root is
yours, and honestly, I think that is just so you can say you accept the
responsibilities of root. See, with your N800, I think you tinkered with it because
you knew you could tweak it. With an iPhone, basically it either does something you
want or you are out of luck.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Yeah, I wanted to tweak with the N800 more, I'll grant you that. I even wrote
an article on it. Although the N800 and N900 share an ancestry, the use case is
different. One's a tablet PC companion, the other is a phone. But jailbreaking
isn't much harder than installing your rootsh program. I ran one executable on the
computer, and it was done. Regarding the iPhone, I've gotten it to do the tasks I've
needed. I've clearly not been out of luck with it.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Yet I bet you didn't get that jailbreaking app from the app store did you?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> No, of course not. It was merely a google away.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> It's like saying, &ldquo;Sure, I can get any cable channel I want now that I got
this descrambler.&rdquo;
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Well, yeah, so what? I can get any cable channel I want. But that's not the
point of this column, is it? We're not here to discuss the morality of a device,
but its practicality.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Really the argument between the
iPhone and environments like Maemo is no
different from the argument about OS X versus Linux.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I'll agree there. Actually, they are precisely the same, as iPhoneOS uses the
OS X kernel, and Maemo uses Linux. That's the first analogy you've used in this
article that has legs.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> It comes down to whether you are willing to sacrifice the freedoms you are
used to in Linux to have something that allegedly &ldquo;just works&rdquo;, or if it doesn't,
you can buy apps until it does.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I'll bet you I've spent less on my iPhone + apps than you did on your N900.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Possibly. After all, I bought the N900 shortly after it came out at an
unsubsidized and <span   class="emphasis"><em>unlocked</em></span> price. Just like on OS X, you can
generally buy your way out of your problems.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Sometimes, that's the most efficient use of resources. My time is worth
something.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> But then, you seem to be fine with any and all locks, so I'm sure you are
fine being locked into a phone contract as well.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> I don't like most locks. I typically break them. I don't mind a phone
contract though. 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> See, my time is worth something, but so is
my freedom. The beauty of open-source software is that most of the time, I'm not the only one who wants a feature.
Because the platform is open, most of the time someone else adds a cool program or
feature for me. Even if others don't, at least I have the option if I want it. Plus,
on the N900, I can code in C, C++, Python or even bash and use either GTK or Qt if
I want, and I don't have to get Apple's blessing for others to use and help improve
my program.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> You're trying to pitch me on running Linux, man. I am on the editorial staff
here. I get it. I choose, <span   class="emphasis"><em>today</em></span>, for my wireless device not to run Linux. I'll
admit, that irks me a bit. But it's not enough to cause me to dump the installed base
and change my work paradigm...again.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> I'm just saying the same principles apply whether your computer is
desktop-sized or fits in your pocket. In fact, as more and more people use
pocket-sized computers, these issues are going to become more important, not less.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> Remember, I moved to the iPhone last year. I really don't feel up to changing
things drastically again. It's about practicality for me.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> The bottom line for me is that I want my portable computer to give me the
same freedoms I'm used to on my desktop or laptop. Right now, for me, the only
platform that seems to get close is Maemo. I think the open-source model works, and
I want it enjoy those advantages no matter what device I use.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> That's cool, and that's your priority. Mine is to have the device's tech just
get the heck out of my way so I can do what I need to do. At the end of the day,
I'm tired, and I want to get stuff done so I can get home to my kids.
</p><p>
I won't lie and say I've not thought about getting an N900. I have. They look
way cool, but playing with a device isn't my top priority right now.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle:</b></span> Like always, I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Bill:</b></span> You think we'll have to? I know we will. But
that's okay, we've done that
before too.
