Mandriva Enterprise Server</h2></div></div><p>
Mandriva bills its new Enterprise Server 5 (MES 5) as &ldquo;simple and
innovative&rdquo;, combining the best of Linux (reliability, security, low
admin costs) with the best of Mandriva Linux (easy to use, exclusive
Mandriva tools and professional services) for the administration and
integration of servers. The most noteworthy new feature in the update
is increased scalability in virtualization, driven by the added kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) technology. Other new features include the
integrated Mandriva Directory Server, reduced bootup times, increased
modularization to allow easier configuration of specialized servers and
reduced energy consumption, among others.

Terracotta's Ehcache</h2></div></div><p>
Terracotta's Ehcache, a popular open-source, enterprise-level caching
solution, has added a new feature set wrapped in its latest 2.0 release.
Terracotta says that Ehcache 2.0 adds enterprise-class capabilities of
high-priced and proprietary technologies like Oracle Coherence without
requiring application changes. Furthermore, this release brings instant
scale to the majority of Java applications without code changes or costly
database upgrades. Additional new features simplify the development
effort, testing and scale-out, such as an express mode that easily
clusters application data via configuration changes. Finally, a series
of enterprise features better integrate Ehcache with the database, such
as JTA for transactions and data write-behind to increase performance
while avoiding database bottlenecks.

6WIND's 6WINDGate</h2></div></div><p>
Embedded developer 6WIND's newly upgraded 6WINDGate, a packet processing
application for networking and telecommunications systems, adds new
features, such as ten-fold acceleration of packet processing functions
and support for the multicore, embedded Intel Xeon processors EC5549
and E5645. The 10x speed-up compared to a standard Linux implementation
allows customers to reuse their existing application software and
accelerate their time to market. 6WIND further adds that the 6WINDGate
SDS profile is optimized for platforms in which the networking Fast
Path runs on dedicated cores without the overhead of a Linux-based Slow
Path. 6WINDGate's architecture removes the complexity of integrating
high-performance packet processing with the Linux environment, because
it fully synchronizes the Fast Path and Linux, while preserving Linux
APIs. It includes complete Layer 2 through Layer 4 embedded networking
features (routing, IPsec, firewall, QoS, NAT, multicast and so on), reducing
development time by as much as 70%.

Scott F. Andrews' <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Guild Leader's Handbook</em></span> (No Starch Press)</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;Who said dragon slaying was easy?&rdquo; is author Scott F. Andrews' Bilbo
Baggins-esque invitation to try his new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Guild Leader's
Handbook</em></span>,
a guide to leading a guild in massively multiplayer on-line (MMO) games.
Subtitled &ldquo;Strategies and Guidance from a Battle-Scarred MMO
Veteran&rdquo;,
the book outlines not just how to create, build and maintain a successful
guild but also how to lead it to glory. Andrews should know, because
he leads one of the oldest-surviving guilds in <span   class="emphasis"><em>World of
Warcraft</em></span>.
He shares secrets from his long experience to illustrate how to plan
successful raids, player vs. player battles, role-playing sessions and
contests; deal with problem players and keep a lid on guild-fracturing
drama; solve loot issues and choose the best loot system; boost morale,
reputation and server presence; and promote and motivate an effective
officer corps. <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Guild Leader's Handbook</em></span> is published by No Starch
Press.

Imsys' SNAP Classic</h2></div></div><p>
The Swedish firm Imsys proudly announced a new generation of its SNAP
Classic module, a drop-in replacement for the DSTINI390 reference
design&mdash;a Java-based networked controller. Using the same module size and
interfaces, the SNAP Classic provides all interfaces supported on the TINI
platform. The new SNAP Classic offers greatly improved performance while
reducing cost and power consumption, retaining all the legacy and adding
new compelling features. For heavy-duty, floating-point computations,
SNAP Classic now offers a performance increase of more than 200 times that
of TINI, says Imsys. A &ldquo;crypto engine&rdquo; consisting of 27 new opcodes
supports ARC4, DES, AES, RSA, MD5, SHA1 and SHA256, accelerating them by
a factor of up to 43 times compared to their C code implementations
on the same processor.	For development, the SNAP Classic user can
use either free Java tools or purchase the optional Imsys Developer,
a professional IDE that enables the developer to use a mix of Java, C
and assembler programming.

Mobile Edge ScanFast Laptop Cases</h2></div></div><p>
From the &ldquo;Not Just for Linux Geeks Desk&rdquo; comes Mobile Edge's new ScanFast
line of laptop carrying cases and accessories, which the producer claims
to be &ldquo;the first TSA-Compliant Netbook case collection on the
market&rdquo;.
ScanFast is targeted at Netbook owners seeking a case more substantial
than a simple sleeve and encompasses the Edge Netbook Briefcase, Messenger
Bag and Backpack products. Each product has the additional advantage of
being checkpoint-friendly at airports. To be checkpoint-friendly, TSA
requires laptop compartments to be independent and clear of any other
gadgets, cords, metal zippers and so on, and screeners must have a clear
unobstructed view of the laptop itself. The cases support notebooks up
to 13.3" (34cm) wide.

DVEO's eYeCatcher ATSC-M/H</h2></div></div><p>
DVEO is now shipping the new eYeCatcher ATSC-M/H, a compact test modulator
for emulating Mobile DTV (digital TV) signals. Designed for use
in development labs and for technology demonstration purposes, the eYeCatcher ATSC M/H is a portable frequency agile modulator with IP, ASI
or SMPTE 310M input and ATSC M/H output. It delivers real-time or stored
video to cell phones, PDAs, handhelds and vehicles. The device is ideal
for laboratory applications, testing set-top boxes and mobile devices,
and in-store demonstrations of ATSC M/H devices.

Undo Software UndoDB</h2></div></div><p>
The Cambridge, UK-based Undo Software bills the new version 3.0 of its
reversible debugger for Linux, UndoDB, as &ldquo;a huge step
backwards&rdquo;.
UndoDB's reversible debugging capabilities (also known as replay or
historical debugging) allows a developer to step or run an application
backward and so answer the real question when debugging: &ldquo;How did
that happen?&rdquo; The Undo folks say that UndoDB 3.0 can debug nearly any
Linux process, including those using multiple threads, asynchronous
signal handlers and shared memory. The new edition also is reputed to be
faster than ever, running applications with a slow-down of just 1.7x while
still keeping full visibility of the program's entire execution history.
Finally, UndoDB 3.0 supports reverse watchpoints, allowing programmers
to find the root cause of elusive memory-corruption bugs easily.
