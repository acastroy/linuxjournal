&ldquo;What is a library? It's like Google made out of a
tree.&rdquo;&mdash;tevoul on Reddit.com
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1bea358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
At first glance, you might assume that I'm going to discuss code libraries in this
article,
but instead, I'm talking about an actual library&mdash;one made of books,
magazines and other dead-tree sources of wisdom. I
have always collected books, and each new project or pastime becomes an excuse
to
expand my library. I don't always know
what I have or, more important, where a certain book is. I try to keep my
library organized in
a physical sense, but I've always wanted a system that kept better track of
my
books.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1bea510"></a>
Goals and Deliciousness</h2></div></div><p>
The goals for this project are pretty straightforward. I need something
that can track
all of the books I own. A big part of my collection is in my library at
home,
but I also have a large set of technical books at my office. I'd love to be
able
to see images of the covers (&agrave; la Delicious Monster&mdash;a Mac
program that
originally inspired me to sort this out). I also need something to show me
where in
the library the book is physically&mdash;the cabinet and shelf would be
nice. One last thing is
data entry. I have several thousand books, and I'd prefer not to have to
type in a lot
of information.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1bea670"></a>
First Stop: Actual Library Software</h2></div></div><p>
The cool part about the Open Source world is that you can access 
software
that is way beyond the scale of what you need. In the case of this project,
I found
Koha. According to the Web site,
&ldquo;Koha is the first
open-source Integrated Library System (ILS). In use worldwide, its
development is
steered by a growing community of libraries collaborating to achieve their
technology goals.&rdquo; The project is targeted at actual libraries,
which sounded
like overkill, but I could not resist downloading and taking it for a spin.
</p><p>
I decided to play with the development version (as the last release was
June
2009). The first step was to check out the code repository:


<pre     class="programlisting">
git clone git://git.koha.org/pub/scm/koha.git kohaclone
</pre>
</p><p>
The repository actually had install instructions for several distributions.
Because
I'm running Ubuntu, I followed those instructions. Based on the differences
between the Web site instructions for installing on Hardy (8.04) and the
instructions in the development version, it looks like a number of packages
outside the standard package tree have been added. That is a good sign,
because it means installation will get easier and easier. Be warned though,
Koha is built using Perl, and a few Perl libraries are not
currently packaged in Jaunty. The instructions show you how to use CPAN to
install
them properly (although that means you will have CPAN versions that are not
controlled by the package system&mdash;a side effect of working with CPAN).
After
following all the instructions and getting everything installed, I ran
through the
Web install to set up the database.
</p><p>
Once everything was up and &ldquo;running&rdquo;, I was ready to dive in
to the heady
world of running my own library. After spending an inordinate amount of
time
figuring out that I needed to provide some default values for the library
and the
type of content I was going to track, I was ready to add my first book.
Pulling up
Koha's add form presents a huge page of options, most of which meant very little
to me
(such as Leader, Control Number Identified and Fixed Length Data Elements).
I forged
ahead by trying to search for one of my test books by ISBN. I had to do
something
called a Z39.50 search. This is a protocol used for getting book
information from
other libraries. In the process, I learned that I had to add my own Z39.50
sources. I used the Library of Congress, because I figured it would have
the most
complete records (Settings are z390.loc.gov:7090 Database:Voyager - Syntax
USMARC). Once all that was set up, I was able to add the book.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10764f1.large.jpg"><img src="10764f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The Koha catalog screen&mdash;something tells me this is
overkill.
</p></div></div><p>
All of the above was a lot of work, and I added only a single book. As much
as
I would like to use an industrial-strength tool, the system was too
confusing
for me as a layperson (my wife was kind enough to point out that there is a
reason
it is called Library Science). If you want to see what a properly
configured Koha
system is capable of, go to the Plano ISD library system
(see Resources), which is running a version of
Koha. It shows the
book covers and even has a shelf browser. So if you have your own public
library,
Koha is really neat, but I realized I needed something else.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1beabf0"></a>
&ldquo;Personal&rdquo; Is the Keyword</h2></div></div><p>
I eventually figured out that the problem with my previous searches for
software
was the omission of the word &ldquo;personal&rdquo;. Adding that word
narrows down the Google search a lot. As a result, I found two
different options to consider: Alexandria and GCstar. Unlike Koha, both are
available as Ubuntu packages. After dealing with the install guide for
Koha, it was
nice that all I had to do was <tt  >apt-get install</tt>, and I
could try
them both (well,
that was almost all I had to do). In the process of playing with these
tools, I found another
application called Tellico. It was nice to have several apps from which to
choose.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1beae00"></a>Alexandria</h2></div></div><p>
Alexandria is a Ruby GNOME
application for
managing a book collection. The current official version is 0.6.5. Things
got off
to a very bumpy start with Alexandria. The default version in Jaunty is
0.6.3. It
was not able to find either of the test books. Even worse than that, it
crashed
and exited when I tried to search by ISBN. Not one to give up easily, I
ended up
downloading a current beta version (0.6.6-beta1). There was a problem
related to
two Ruby libraries because I was installing it under Jaunty. To get
everything to
work, I had to install two gems (hpricot and htmlentities) and manually
install the
package:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo dpkg   --ignore-depends=libhpricot-ruby -i
 &#8618;Desktop/alexandria_0.6.6beta1.deb
</pre>
</p><p>
The system relies on Amazon for some of the
lookups. Due to a change in Amazon's policy, I had to sign up to get my
own Amazon AWS access key. An explanation and link are available on the
Alexandria
Web site (see Resources).
Technically, I could have removed Amazon as a provider and skipped
this step.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10764f2.large.jpg"><img src="10764f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Alexandria Loaded with Some Books
</p></div></div><p>
The application itself is very simple, which was a nice change after wading
through
so many screens on Koha. You can search for books by title or ISBN. It
lets you
browse your library and search by details.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1beb1c8"></a>GCstar</h2></div></div><p>
GCstar collection management started out as
GCfilms.
As a result, it supports many different kinds of collections, including
books, movies, music and board games, among others. It also allows you to
define
your own collection type, so you can track and collect anything you
want.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10764f3.large.jpg"><img src="10764f3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. GCstar Loaded with Books
</p></div></div><p>
Installing GCstar was easy. I installed the package and then
started the application. Obviously, I chose to start a collection of books.
I clicked 
Add and started the process of looking up a book. I tried to use Amazon
as an information source, but it never found anything. I assume this is
related
to the same policy change that affected Alexandria. I ended up using 
ISBNdb.com as
my main source and was able to pull up information and book covers for all
my
test books. To make sure this wasn't fixed in a later version, I upgraded
the package to 1.5.0, and it still had the same problem.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1beb4e0"></a>Tellico</h2></div></div><p>
Tellico is a collection management application for KDE. It was available as a
package, which installed with no problems. After creating a new collection
of books,
my first step was to add one of the test books. The process of adding a
book was
the most confusing out of the three applications. I clicked Create a new
entry, which pulled up a dialog with a lot of options spread out over six
different tabs. Title was on the first tab. ISBN was on the Publishing
tab. I entered in a title for a book and clicked Save Entry. On the
other applications, doing that triggered a lookup, but Tellico just sat
there
with no additional data. Eventually, I found an option to say Update
Entry, which was able to pull down information and update it (though no
book
cover was provided). I tried a second time, and this time, I filled out
only the ISBN
field. I saved the entry and asked it to update, but nothing changed.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="10764f4.large.jpg"><img src="10764f4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Default Tellico View
</p></div></div><p>
The version that shipped with Jaunty was 1.3.5. Version 2.1 was available
as a
Lucid package, so I decided to install that to see if any of these problems
had
been resolved. The good news is that the newer version fixed the problem
with
Amazon. The bad news is that it still was not able to look up the book with
only
the ISBN. The ISBN allows you to identify a book uniquely, which should
simplify
the process of confirming what book you are talking about. Searching by
title
provides a list of a lot of other books that are not the ones I want.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1beb7f8"></a>Adding Additional Lookup Sources</h2></div></div><p>
Now that I was able to add books to all three applications, I wanted to see
how
hard it was to add additional sources for lookup. GCstar ships with a
number of
sources. The application itself does not let you add or configure any of
the
sources, so your only option is to pick which one to use. The process of
adding a
book was straightforward. You just click Add and then put in the
information. I am not sure if the problem was with authentication or
something
else, but the tool never found anything using Amazon as a source. I was
able to
pull up information about my books using ISBNdb.com. Once GCstar
finds a book, the
system pulls in a lot of details, including the book cover. There also is
a field for storing the book's location. It is just a free-text field,
so I
would have to come up with my own way of encoding location. You can search
by
location, but there is no way to sort by it or store the search, so you
can't
browse the shelves based on where they are, which ends up being useful in
my
library, as I keep books on the same topic clumped together.
</p><p>
GCstar does not have any support for a scanner; however, it does have a
number of
different options for importing data. It even can import an Alexandria
collection.
One way to get the data into the system is to put the ISBN numbers into a
CSV file, and
GCStar then can import that CSV. Once the data is loaded, you have to go to
each
book to trigger the lookup in the remote repository.
</p><p>
Alexandria allowed me to add
my Amazon credentials. It also supports adding in custom Z39.50 sources.
Tellico
had the most extensive list of options for adding additional
sources. It
included support for Z39.50 as well as GCstar plugins.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1beba60"></a>
Where Is That Book?</h2></div></div><p>
One of the problems I run into with my library is that even if I remember I
have a
book, I don't remember where it is. Recently, I moved a large chunk of my
technical books to my office, making the situation even worse, so I want to
be able to
track books'
locations.
</p><p>
Alexandria does not have any concept of location
baked in. It does support tags, which would allow me to enter a tag to give
me a
better idea about a book's location (for example, Home:Cabinet 1:Shelf 3).
The
search allows me to search by tags, so I could see other things on the same
shelf,
which
would be useful because I tend to put books on the same subject next to
each other.
</p><p>
GCstar 1.3.2 had a field for location. The newer 1.5 version has replaced
that
with support for tags. Once the books were tagged, I could browse the books
by
grouping them by tags. The search function did not support tags, so I
couldn't limit my searches to books only at home or only at my office.
</p><p>
Tellico had the
most advanced features for this part. I actually could add specific fields
for
library, cabinet and shelf. Then, I could use those fields for grouping and
searching.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1bebc70"></a>Entering Books into the System</h2></div></div><p>
All this searching and sorting is useful, but I saved the most important
consideration for last. How do I get all my books into the system? The
first
option is simply to type in the ISBN of all my books. If your
library is small enough that you are willing to do this, you probably don't
need a
system to track your books.
</p><p>
The next option is a barcode scanner. I happen to have a Flic Bluetooth
barcode
scanner from a previous project, and I was fortunate enough to find a great
guide to
getting it working under Linux (see Resources).
Once everything was set up, I was able to scan the ISBNs from all the books
quickly
into a text file.
</p><p>
I tried to import the ISBNs into Tellico, but each time, it
crashed on the import. I wasn't able to confirm whether this was a problem
with the
program or the way I installed it.
</p><p>
GCstar was able to import the list of ISBNs
with no problem. The annoying part of that process was that once the books
were
imported, it did not do any lookup on the ISBN. I had to go to each book
individually to tell it to download the data. Once I did, I got the book
cover and
everything else.
</p><p>
Alexandria got it right. Not only did it do the import, but it
also downloaded the information about the books.
</p><p>
I realize that not everyone has a barcode scanner lying around. Don't
worry; you have
other options. If you have a Webcam, you can install ZBar. This
barcode-scanning software turns
your Webcam into a barcode scanner. I was able to get the same list of
barcodes
from ZBar that I got from my barcode scanner. The only downside is that I
had to
bring each book to the camera. It's a lot cheaper, but not nearly as
convenient if you are scanning in a lot of books.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1be27c0"></a>
Remote Options</h2></div></div><p>
All the solutions I looked at are downloadable, but it seems a little silly
to ignore
some of the options available on the Web. I looked at two different on-line
options:
Shelfari and LibraryThing. It was very easy to add a book on
both sites.
I also was able to import my list of ISBNs into both sites. On Shelfari,
the
import happened very quickly. On LibraryThing, it was thrown into a queue,
and I was
told that it would take up to an hour for the ISBNs to process.
</p><p>
As for sources,
LibraryThing supports more than 690 different sources for information.
Shelfari did not
offer any information source options. Amazon acquired
Shelfari in August 2008,
so I assume that is where it gets all its data.
</p><p>
Both sites support tags, so
I can use that to encode the books' locations.
</p><p>
Because these are both Web sites, they offer advantages and disadvantages.
You easily
can access the library data from multiple computers. On the other hand, you
may not want everyone in the world to know you have every book on Pokemon
ever
published. Originally, I was concerned any data I put into either site
would
be locked there, but after some surfing, I found that both sites will
provide you with a
complete download of your library data.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1af2580.0x1be29d0"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
I had a Shelfari account before I wrote this article. I often use it to
create
virtual bookshelves to talk about what I'm reading or to recommend a
reading list.
I thought about moving my collection into it, but I would prefer to work
locally
before I deal with putting everything on the Internet. After looking at the
various options, I decided to start with Alexandria. It was the easiest to
use and
was best for what I need it to do. Plus, it is built using Ruby
(a language I know), so I might have a shot at adding any features I need.
As a test,
I exported the information I already had put into Shelfari into Alexandria.
Then, I was
able to export the Alexandria data to both Tellico and GCstar. That means
once I collect all the data, I always can switch applications later, which
may be essential, as I noticed Alexandria started to slow down with only
400
books in it. Now, I just need to carve out the time to get scanning!
