A look at some of MongoDB's features, such as indexing and object
relationships.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11f1580.0x12e9358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Last month, I started discussing MongoDB, an open-source
non-relational &ldquo;document-based&rdquo; database that has been growing in
popularity during the past year. Unlike relational databases, which
store all information in two-dimensional tables, MongoDB stores
everything in something akin to a set of hash tables.
</p><p>
In a relational database, you can be sure that every record (that is, row)
in a table has the same number and set of columns. By contrast,
MongoDB is schema-less, meaning there is no enforcement of such
rules on columns. Two records in a MongoDB collection might have 
identical keys, or they might have no two keys in common. Ensuring
that the keys are meaningful, and that they will not be prone to abuse
or error, is the programmer's responsibility.
</p><p>
Working with MongoDB turns out to be fairly straightforward, as I showed
in several examples last month. Once you have set up a database and a
collection, you can add, remove and modify records using a
combination of objects in your favorite language and the MongoDB query
language.
</p><p>
The fact that it's easy to work with MongoDB doesn't mean that it's
lacking in high-powered features, however. This month, I describe
some of the features you're likely to use if you incorporate
MongoDB into your applications, such as indexing and object
relationships. If you're like me, you'll see there is a lot to
like; plus, using MongoDB prods you to think about your data in new
and different ways.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11f1580.0x12e96c8"></a>
Indexing</h2></div></div><p>
As I explained last month, MongoDB has its own query language, allowing you
to retrieve records whose attributes match certain conditions. For
example, if you have a book database, you might want to find all
books with a certain title. One way to perform such a retrieval
would be to iterate over each of the records, pulling out all those
that precisely match the title in question. In Ruby, you could express
this as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
books.find_all {|b| b.title == search_title}
</pre>
</p><p>
The problem with this approach is that it's quite slow. The system
needs to iterate over each of the items, which means as the list
of books grows, so too will the time it takes to find what you're
seeking.
</p><p>
The solution to this problem, as database programmers have long known,
is to use an index. Indexes come in various forms, but the basic idea
is that they allow you to find all records with a
particular value for the title immediately (or any column field), without having
to scan through each of the individual records.
It should come as no surprise, then, that MongoDB supports indexes.
How can you use them?
</p><p>
Continuing with this book example, I inserted about 43,000 books into a
MongoDB collection. Each inserted document was a Ruby hash, storing
the book's ISBN, title, weight and publication date. Then, I could
retrieve a book using MongoDB's client program, which provides an
interactive JavaScript interface:


<pre     class="programlisting">
   ./bin/mongo atf
&gt; db.books.count()
   38202
&gt; db.books.find({isbn:'9789810185060'})
   { "_id" : ObjectId("4b8fca3ef23f3c614600a8c2"),
     "title" : "Primary Mathematics 4A Textbook",
     "weight" : 40,
     "publication_date" : "2003-01-01",
     "isbn" : "9789810185060" }
</pre>
</p><p>
The query certainly seems to execute quickly enough, but if there were
millions of records, it would slow down quite a bit. You can give
the database server a speed boost by adding an index on the isbn
column:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.books.ensureIndex({isbn:1})
</pre>
</p><p>
This creates an index on the isbn column in ascending order. You
also could specify -1 (instead of 1) to indicate that the items should
be indexed in descending order.
</p><p>
Just as a relational database automatically puts an index on the
&ldquo;primary key&rdquo; column of a table, MongoDB automatically indexes the
unique _id attribute on a collection. Every other index needs to be
created manually. And indeed, now if you get a list of the indexes, you
will see that not only is the isbn column indexed, but so is _id:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.books.getIndexes()
   [
       {
               "name" : "_id_",
               "ns" : "atf.books",
               "key" : {
                       "_id" : ObjectId("000000000000000000000000")
               }
       },
       {
               "ns" : "atf.books",
               "key" : {
                       "isbn" : 1
               },
               "name" : "isbn_1"
       }
   ]
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can perform the same query as before, requesting all of the
books with a particular ISBN. You won't see any change in your result
set; however, you should get a response more quickly than before.
</p><p>
You also can create a compound index, which looks at more than one
key:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.books.ensureIndex({title:1, weight:1})
</pre>
</p><p>
Perhaps it doesn't make sense to combine the index for a book's title
with that of its weight. Nevertheless, that's what I have now done in the
example.
If you later decide you don't want this index, you can remove it
with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.books.dropIndex('title_1_weight_1')
   { "nIndexesWas" : 3, "ok" : 1 }
</pre>
</p><p>
Because I'm using the JavaScript interface, the response 
is a JSON object, indicating that there used to be three indexes (and
now there are only two), and that the function executed successfully. If
you try to drop the index a second time, you'll get an error message:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.books.dropIndex('title_1_weight_1')
   { "errmsg" : "index not found", "ok" : 0 }
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11f1580.0x12e9eb0"></a>
Enforcing Uniqueness</h2></div></div><p>
Indexes not only speed up many queries, but they also allow you to ensure
uniqueness. That is, if you want to be sure that a particular
attribute is unique across all the documents in a collection, you
can define the index with the &ldquo;unique&rdquo; parameter.
</p><p>
For example, let's get a record from the current collection:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.books.findOne()
   {
      "_id" : ObjectId("4b8fc9baf23f3c6146000b90"),
      "title" : "\"Gateways to Academic Writing: Effective Sentences,
                   Paragraphs, and Essays\"",
      "weight" : 0,
      "publication_date" : "2004-02-01",
      "isbn" : "0131408887"
   }
</pre>
</p><p>
If you try to insert a new document with the same ISBN, MongoDB won't
care:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.books.save({isbn:'0131408887', title:'fake book'})
</pre>
</p><p>
But in theory, there should be only one book with each ISBN. This
means the database can (and should) have a uniqueness constraint
on ISBN. You can achieve this by dropping and re-creating your index,
indicating that the new version of the index also should enforce
uniqueness:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.books.dropIndex("isbn_1")
   { "nIndexesWas" : 2, "ok" : 1 }
&gt; db.books.ensureIndex({isbn:1}, {unique:true})
   E11000 duplicate key errorindex: atf.books.$isbn_1  
   &#8618;dup key: { : "0131408887" }
</pre>
</p><p>
Uh-oh. It turns out that there are some duplicate ISBNs in the database
already. The good news is that MongoDB shows which key is the
offender. Thus, you could go through the database (either manually or
automatically, depending on the size of the data set) and remove this
key, re-try to create the index, and so on, until everything works. Or,
you can tell the ensureIndex function that it should drop any duplicate
records.
</p><p>
Yes, you read that correctly. MongoDB will, if you ask it to, not only
create a unique index, but also drop anything that would cause that
constraint to be violated. I'm pretty sure I would not want to
use this function on actual production data, just because it scares me
to think that my database would be removing data. But in this example case,
with a toy dataset, it works just fine:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.books.ensureIndex({isbn:1}, {unique:true, dropDups:true})
   E11000 duplicate key errorindex: atf.books.$isbn_1  
   &#8618;dup key: { : "0131408887" }
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, what happens if you try to insert a non-unique ISBN again?


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.books.save({isbn:'0131408887', title:'fake book'})
   E11000 duplicate key errorindex: atf.books.$isbn_1  
   &#8618;dup key: { : "0131408887" }
</pre>
</p><p>
You may have as many indexes as you want on a collection. Like with a
relational database, the main cost of an index is obvious when you
insert or update data, so if you expect to insert or update your
documents a great deal, you should carefully consider how many indexes
you want to create.
</p><p>
A second, and more subtle, issue (referenced in David Mytton's blog
post&mdash;see Resources) is that there is a
namespace limit in each MongoDB database, and that this namespace is
used by both collections and indexes.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11f1580.0x12ea6f0"></a>
Combining Objects</h2></div></div><p>
One of the touted advantages of an object database&mdash;or a
&ldquo;document&rdquo;
database, as MongoDB describes itself&mdash;is that you can store just
about anything inside it, without the &ldquo;impedance mismatch&rdquo; that
exists when storing objects in a relational database's two-dimensional
tables. So if your object contains a few strings, a few dates and a
few integers, you should be just fine.
</p><p>
However, many situations exist in which this is not quite enough.
One classic example (discussed in many MongoDB FAQs and interviews) is
that of a blog. It makes sense to have a collection of blog posts,
and for each post to have a date, a title and a body. But, you'll
also need an author, and assuming that you want to store
more than just the author's name, or another simple text string, you
probably will want to have each author stored as an object.
</p><p>
So, how can you do that? The simplest way is to store an object
along with each blog post. If you have used a high-level language,
such as Ruby or Python before, this won't come as a surprise;
you're just sticking a hash inside a hash (or if you're a Python
hacker, then a dict inside of a dict). So, in the JavaScript client, you
can say:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.blogposts.save({title:'title',
                        body:'this is the body',
                        author:{name:'Reuven', 
                        &#8618;email:'reuven@lerner.co.il'} })
</pre>
</p><p>
Remember, MongoDB creates a collection for you if it doesn't 
exist already. Then, you can retrieve your post with:



<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.blogposts.findOne()
   {
           "_id" : ObjectId("4b91070a9640ce564dbe5a35"),
           "title" : "title",
           "body" : "this is the body",
           "author" : {
                   "name" : "Reuven",
                   "email" : "reuven@lerner.co.il"
           }
   }
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, you can retrieve the e-mail address of that author with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.blogposts.findOne()['author']['email']
   reuven@lerner.co.il
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, you even can search:

<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.blogposts.findOne({title:'titleee'})
   null
</pre>
</p><p>
In other words, no postings matched the search criteria.
</p><p>
Now, if you have worked with relational databases for any length of
time, you probably are thinking, &ldquo;Wait a second. Is he
saying I should store an identical author object with each
posting that the author made?&rdquo; And the answer is yes&mdash;something
that I admit gives me the heebie-jeebies. MongoDB, like many
other document databases, does not require or even expect that you
will normalize your data&mdash;the opposite of what you would do with a
relational database.
</p><p>
The advantages of a non-normalized approach are that it's easy to work
with in general and is much faster. The disadvantage, as everyone
who ever has studied normalization knows, is that if you need to
update the author's e-mail address, you need to iterate over all
the entries in your collection&mdash;an expensive task in many
cases. In addition, there's always the chance that different blog
postings will spell the same author's name in different ways, leading
to problems with data integrity.
</p><p>
If there is one issue that gives me pause when working with MongoDB,
it is this one&mdash;the fact that the data isn't normalized goes against
everything that I've done over the years. I'm not sure whether my
reaction indicates that I need to relax about this issue, choose
MongoDB only for particularly appropriate tasks, or if I'm a
dinosaur.
</p><p>
MongoDB does offer a partial solution. Instead of embedding an object
within another object, you can enter a reference to another object,
either in the same collection or in another collection. For example,
you can create a new &ldquo;authors&rdquo; collection in your database, and then
create a new author:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; db.authors.save({name:'Reuven', email:'reuven@lerner.co.il'})

&gt; a = db.authors.findOne()
   {
           "_id" : ObjectId("4b910a469640ce564dbe5a36"),
           "name" : "Reuven",
           "email" : "reuven@lerner.co.il"
   }
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can assign this author to your blog post, replacing the object
literal from before:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; p = db.blogposts.findOne()
&gt; p['author'] = a

&gt; p
   {
           "_id" : ObjectId("4b91070a9640ce564dbe5a35"),
           "title" : "title",
           "body" : "this is the body",
           "author" : {
                   "_id" : ObjectId("4b910a469640ce564dbe5a36"),
                   "name" : "Reuven",
                   "email" : "reuven@lerner.co.il"
           }
   }
</pre>
</p><p>
Although the blog post looks similar to what you had before, notice that
it now has its own &ldquo;_id&rdquo; attribute. This shows that you are
referencing another object in MongoDB. Changes to that object are
immediately reflected, as you can see here:


<pre     class="programlisting">
&gt; a['name'] = 'Reuven Lerner'
   Reuven Lerner
&gt; p
   {
           "_id" : ObjectId("4b91070a9640ce564dbe5a35"),
           "title" : "title",
           "body" : "this is the body",
           "author" : {
                   "_id" : ObjectId("4b910a469640ce564dbe5a36"),
                   "name" : "Reuven Lerner",
                   "email" : "reuven@lerner.co.il"
           }
   }
</pre>
</p><p>
See how the author's &ldquo;name&rdquo; attribute was updated immediately? That's
because you have an object reference here, rather than an embedded
object.
</p><p>
Given the ease with which you can reference objects from other objects,
why not do this all the time? To be honest, this is definitely my
preference, perhaps reflecting my years of work with relational
databases. MongoDB's authors, by contrast, indicate that the main
problem with this approach is that it requires additional reads from
the database, which slows down the data-retrieval process. You will
have to decide what trade-offs are appropriate for your needs, both
now and in the future.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
MongoDB is an impressive database, with extensive documentation and
drivers. It is easy to begin working with MongoDB, and the
interactive shell is straightforward for anyone with even a bit of
JavaScript and database experience. Indexes are fairly easy to
understand, create and apply.
</p><p>
Where things get tricky, and even sticky, is precisely in the area
where relational databases have excelled (and have been optimized) for
decades&mdash;namely, the interactions and associations among related
objects, ensuring data integrity without compromising
speed too much. I'm sure MongoDB will continue to improve in
this area, but for now, this is the main thing that bothers me about
MongoDB. Nevertheless, I've been impressed by what I've seen so far,
and I easily can imagine using it on some of my future projects,
especially those that will have a limited number of cross-collection
references.
