In the March 2010 Point/Counterpoint column, Kyle Rankin pretends that he has to use --prefix to install apache to /usr/local instead
of /usr.
</p><p>
Well, he surely hasn't used any ./configure script in the past 15 years,
because it goes to /usr/local by default, and apache2 uses
/usr/local/apache2 as a default prefix.
</p><p>
One less &ldquo;point&rdquo; in favor of Kyle, heh?

<span   class="bold"><b>Kyle Rankin replies:</b></span>
You are right. When Bill and I do the Point/Counterpoint column, it's all
off-the-cuff responses, so I talked about --prefix with ./configure while I was
really thinking about --prefix in building and installing RPMs. I didn't
realize the default install location for ./configure was /usr/local
(although in my opinion, that makes an even stronger argument for
/usr/local: it's the default). To be honest, although I compiled many programs
back when I started using Linux (it was almost a requirement to compile the
kernel at the very least), I rarely compile anything anymore, especially
when it's going to be used in production. I think the moment you go down
that road, especially when you have a large environment, you lose all the
testing benefits you get with distribution packages, and you become a QA
department of one. Now, I know that many system
administrators still like to do everything by hand, but to me, the risks and
maintenance headaches of that far outweigh any benefits. It may be okay
with one or two servers, but in my opinion, it doesn't scale.
Thanks for the comment.

Mick Bauer's VPN series is long overdue [see Mick's Paranoid Penguin
columns starting with the February 2010 issue through this current issue].
But in practice, few medium-to-large companies are going to deploy an OpenVPN
server. Their corporate management has at least two requirements it can't meet:
<span   class="emphasis"><em>simplicity</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>support</em></span>. To them, simplicity means a proprietary appliance
from a name-brand vendor&mdash;they distrust software running on *nix in their
infrastructure, never mind that the black-box appliance is probably just
software running on embedded BSD or Linux. And, support is a euphemism for
&ldquo;somebody to sue&rdquo;.
</p><p>
This leaves those of us who need to make VPN connections to multiple
clients/partners in the unenviable position of being stuck with one or more
computers with a half-dozen incompatible proprietary VPN clients installed
(most of which work only on MS Windows).
</p><p>
How about an article on making the OpenVPN client, and/or other open-source VPN
clients, interoperate with servers from some of the popular VPN vendors, such as
Cisco, Juniper, Nortel and so on, and the issues involved in connecting and
authenticating to proprietary VPN servers?

<br><br>&mdash;<br>

</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Mick Bauer replies:</b></span> This particular series of articles was targeted at
home/small-office/medium-office administrators; it was no coincidence that all
my examples talked about connecting back to my house or that I showed a server
configuration allowing only two concurrent connections. But by all means, you're
correct, an article on connecting Linux clients to big commercial VPN
concentrators would be useful. I'll consider that for a future column!
</p><p>
In the meantime, I can offer a quick hint. Whereas in client mode, OpenVPN can
connect only to OpenVPN server processes, the free utility vpnc can connect
to Cisco and Juniper/NetScreen VPN servers.
Thanks for writing!

Making Linux Known to Computer Haters</h4><p>
Microsoft spends hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising
each year, reaching those in the community who own PCs but spend very little
time with them. Microsoft's goal is to reinforce that Microsoft and Windows are
what everyone uses on their PCs and that's just the way it is. I believe if a
survey was taken world-wide on what operating systems were available to home PC
users, a large number would say Windows and Mac. So, what's this letter all
about? It's about finding ways without spending money to get Linux out to
those who have no interest in operating systems in general. How (like Microsoft
and Windows) do we reach people and make them aware of the existence of Linux without spending
money? 
</p><p>
I propose you write a article on the &ldquo;Best Free Creative
Ideas&rdquo; that
promote Linux. Here's mine. Get your readers to leave old copies of
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span> in doctors' waiting rooms (and similar places) where you have a captive audience
looking for something to read. Maybe run a poll for the best ideas from your
readers. 

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
John Van Gaans  <br><br>
</p><p>
John, that's a great idea! Perhaps the Web site is a good place to get
feedback.&mdash;Ed.

Linux across the Age Spectrum</h4><p>
This is a great magazine, and I have learned a great deal from it. I can
safely say that with the help of this magazine, you made this 14-year-old learn
a lot more about Linux, open source and computer management in general. Gotta say,
mad props to you guys&mdash;keep the good news going. I look forward to reading the latest
issue!

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Alex Conrey  <br><br>
</p><p>
Aw shucks, Alex. It thrills me that a 14-year-old reads <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>! I
put my monthly issues in our local school library, but they don't get read
nearly as much as I'd like. The rest of the editorial staff isn't very
keen on my idea of including a centerfold each month with hot new hardware.
It's good to hear that even without such eye candy, the magazine is still
appreciated.&mdash;Ed.

dwm</h4><p>
On my PC running Debian GNU/Linux I use dwm (<a href="http://dwm.suckless.org" target="_self">dwm.suckless.org</a>) as my X window manager, and I
like it very much. Now, on Wikipedia, there is an article about dwm
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwm" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwm</a>), but
there is a discussion going on about deleting the dwm article
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dwm" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dwm</a>).
One of the reasons is &ldquo;This article needs references that appear in
reliable third-party publications.&rdquo;
</p><p>
So, I was wondering if <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> could publish an article about this
small and powerful window manager.

<br><br>&mdash;<br> 
Jan Wagemakers  <br><br>
</p><p>
Thanks for bringing this to our attention. 
We'll take a look at it, and see if it inspires anyone on staff to write
about it.&mdash;Ed.
