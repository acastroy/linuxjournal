VMKings' VPS Hosting Solution</h2></div></div><p>
The management team of cloud provider VMKing, as developers themselves, found standard
virtual servers not to be well tailored to the developer community&mdash;too much or too
little space, insufficient security and no support for their preferred Linux OS(!).
To meet the specialized needs of developers everywhere, VMKings developed a
fast, uncomplicated, developer-focused VPS (Virtual Private Server) hosting
solution. Now developers can serve as administrators of their own
maintenance-free, customizable solution that can be upgraded instantaneously
and scaled to match user needs. The hosting adapts itself to the preferences
of the user, not vice versa, says VMKings. Key features include the choice
of distributions and frameworks that best suit the project, spin up and
root access in minutes, flexible and scalable resource configurations, 99.9%
SLA, blazing-fast enterprise-grade SSDs, a 40-gigabit fault-tolerant network
with multi-regional data-center support and enterprise-grade
hypervisor technology at the back end.

Mender</h2></div></div><p>
The new production release of Mender 1.0, an open-source tool for updating
embedded devices safely and reliably, is now available. Mender's
developers describe the tool as the &ldquo;only open-source over-the-air (OTA)
software updater for embedded Linux devices that integrates both an updater
client and deployment management server&rdquo;, both of which are licensed
under Apache 2.0. Using Mender, embedded development teams venturing into
IoT can focus completely on developing their product instead of squandering
time on building and maintaining a homegrown software updater or cobbling
together a custom combination of tools or scripts to deploy software
updates. Mender utilizes a dual A/B rootfs partition layout to deploy full
image updates and provides automated rollback of failed updates for any
reason, including power loss on the device or poor network connectivity.
This feature allows users to deploy software updates confidently without the
fear of bricking their devices. The Golang-based Mender runs efficiently on
the embedded device and is tightly integrated with the Yocto Project and
U-Boot, making Mender easy to integrate with most production-grade embedded
boards. Going from a fresh system to completing your first managed
deployment with Mender, including server setup, sayeth Mender folk, should
take less than one hour.

MultiTaction's MT Canvus-Connect</h2></div></div><p>
&ldquo;A new era in visual collaboration&rdquo; is the promise of MT
Canvus-Connect, MultiTaction's new real-time collaboration software that
enables visual touchscreen collaboration across remote locations in real
time. The platform-agnostic solution provides remote users the means to
share, manipulate, draw and input information in real time wherever they are
based. MT Canvus-Connect grew out of MultiTaction's MT Canvus product,
which &ldquo;is already unique in the way that it helps visualize big data and
encourages collaborative working&rdquo;. It enables multiple sources, such as
video feeds, web-based applications and content from smart devices, to run in
parallel. MT Canvus-Connect extends this functionality by enabling multiple
remote locations to collaborate in real time. MultiTaction is also a leading
manufacturer of ultra-responsive large touch-display systems, so the software
solutions are all designed from the ground up to function in touch-enabled
environments. MT Canvus-Connect operates in both Linux and Windows
environments and integrates with current meeting-room technologies.

CodeLathe's Tonido Personal Cloud</h2></div></div><p>
CodeLathe counts Dropbox and OneDrive as competitors to its Tonido Personal
Cloud storage service. While the former can cost anywhere from $50 and up
per year to store a TB of data, CodeLathe's cross-platform Tonido for
the desktop is fully free, and storage space is limited only by users' hard
drive capacities. CloudLathe also boasts 100% private, secure file sharing due
to, for instance, not storing user credentials by effecting authentication
directly between the client device and the Tonido server running on a home
PC. Recently, the company launched a next generation of the Tonido personal
cloud software that offers remote access to all documents, photos, music and
videos stored on Intel Core processor-based desktop PCs from a web browser,
smartphone, tablet and DLNA-enabled devices. Seamless global access is
enhanced via Tonido Relay servers strategically placed across three
continents and six countries.

Omesh Tickoo and Ravi Iyer's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Making Sense of Sensors</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
In today's data-driven world, we are surrounded by sensors collecting
various types of data about us and our world. These sensors are the primary
input devices for wearable computers, IoT and other mobile devices.
Professionals seeking to better understand today's sensor-rich devices and
acquire knowledge and skills to develop innovative solutions that exploit
them will be pleased to learn about the new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Making Sense of
Sensors</em></span>.
Written by the team of Omesh Tickoo and Ravi Iyer and published by Apress, the
book is subtitled <span   class="emphasis"><em>End-to-End Algorithms and Infrastructure Design from
Wearable-Devices to Data Centers</em></span>. Presented in a manner that permits readers
to associate the examples with their daily lives, Tickoo and Iyer's book
covers the most common architectures used for deriving meaningful data from
sensors. This book provides readers with the tools to understand how sensor
data is converted into actionable knowledge and provides tips for in-depth
work in this field. Starting with an overview of the general pipeline to
extract meaningful data from sensors, the book then dives deeper into some
commonly used sensors and algorithms designed for knowledge extraction.
Practical examples and pointers to more information are used to outline the
key aspects of Multimodal recognition. The book concludes with a discussion
on relationship extraction, knowledge representation and management.

openHAB</h2></div></div><p>
Partners Canonical, openHAB Foundation and Azul Systems have collaborated
hard to drive development of the new openHAB 2.0 smart-home platform as a
snap package. An alternative to Apple Homekit and Samsung SmartThings,
openHAB from openHAB Foundation is completely free and open source, and acts
as a control hub for home IoT setups. The platform is easy to install,
highly customizable and comes with great performance across a wide range of
hardware, from PCs to Raspberry Pis. Furthermore, openHAB can be used to
control, automate and complement smart-home setups. As an open platform,
openHAB is not tied to any single brand and supports many protocols and
technologies, which enables consumers to mix and match devices. Ubuntu's
contribution to openHAB is snap, a secure universal Linux application format
that makes applications available as a simple one-click download and install
from the Ubuntu Appstore. The snap packaging of openHAB makes it simpler for
home-automation creators to build, test and distribute their smart-home
services. Finally, Azul System's contribution to openHAB is Zulu
Embedded Java Runtime, which is available for a wide range of hardware and
provides optimal performance on home gateways, PCs or ARM-compatible
devices. The sum of the partnership between openHAB, Ubuntu and Azul means
openHAB can be packaged and distributed as a single application, including a
tested Java Runtime, without click-through licenses.

PasswordPing Ltd.'s Exposed Password and Credentials API Service</h2></div></div><p>
The typical online user has an average of 90 active and inactive online
accounts. This exposure to threats, notes software and IT security
specialist PasswordPing Ltd., helps to inform us why billions of credentials
have been exposed in the past five years alone. To assist organizations and
companies to screen their user accounts for known, compromised credentials,
PasswordPing Ltd. announced the launch of its new password and credential
breach notification service. Organizations can be alerted of exposed
credentials and request users to update their credentials when they set up
their account, reset their password or log in to their account. At its core,
PasswordPing is a massive cloud database of exposed credential data. The
company's various web-based APIs provide different views into this data,
tailored for different use cases. The Passwords API, which can be used as
part of a sign-up form or a password-change form, takes a password and
returns a result indicating whether that password has been exposed. The
Credentials API takes a user name/password combination and returns a result
indicating whether those credentials have been exposed. If a user's credentials
are exposed, the user can be notified and prompted to change the password.

CyKick Labs Ltd.'s Telepath</h2></div></div><p>
When a shopper enters a store, the retailer doesn't know if the person
will simply browse, make purchases, shoplift or hold up the register. The
same goes for visitors to a website. The challenge is to prevent and stop
the bad guys without hindering beneficial customer transactions. A new
approach to threat protection, Telepath from CyKick Labs Ltd., leverages big
data to apply behavioral analytics and machine learning to protect web
applications against exploitation by individuals and bots alike. With
Telepath, cyber security teams get early and actionable intelligence on
emerging threats and comprehensive forensics capabilities, as well as
insight into sophisticated attacks. Telepath is able to stop fraud by
understanding normative site visitor behavior, inspecting enterprise web
application transactions non-intrusively. It employs a hybrid approach based
on rules and machine learning to identify suspect behavior. The solution
protects web applications from multiple threats, such as industrial espionage
information theft, account takeover, service disruption, business logic
abuse and insider threats.
