As robots become more prevalent, they soon will be working alongside
humans, relieving some of the burdens as well as taking on more
of the dangers. The systems to make that happen are being built today,
and they are using Linux in a major way.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e4250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
I grew up in the sixties, during the height of the space race. I vividly
remember watching the first moon landing, and I have loved space and all
things space since those early days. Alas, I did not become an astronaut;
instead, I ended up in the tech field writing software. And as much as I
loved NASA, the closest I have come to working with NASA is vicariously
through my nephew who works at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. I
spent many summers with my nephew building and programming robots, and it's
a hobby that I still enjoy very much. 
</p><p>
So, when I became aware that one of
NASA's Centennial Challenges was called the Space Robotics Challenge, I
immediately reached out to several friends to see if they were interested
in forming a team. After getting commitments from four other like-minded
individuals, I registered our team to compete in the challenge.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e4460"></a>
NASA and the Space Robotics Challenge</h2></div></div><p>
The Centennial Challenges program is part of NASA's Space Technology
Mission Directorate (STMD). The STMD creates various challenges in order
to bring together members of industry, academia and the government with
the goal being the advancement of innovation in key areas of technology
important to the agency. These challenges are meant to engage individuals
and teams from all walks of life. Whether you are a hobbyist, such as
myself, or a member of a team from a tier-one technology lab, such as MIT,
NASA has made these challenges accessible to everyone.
</p><p>
The technical coordinator for the Space Robotics Challenge (SRC)
is NineSights, and according to its website, &ldquo;The SRC focuses on
developing software to increase the autonomy of dexterous mobile robots
in humanoid format&mdash;specifically NASA's R5 robot&mdash;so they can complete
specific tasks during space travel or after landing on other planets
(such as Mars), as well as on Earth.&rdquo;
</p><p>
The SRC involved two rounds of competition: the first round, better known
as the qualifying round, and the second round, referred to as the virtual
competition. The qualifying round involved two tasks: a visual task and
a mobility task. The visual task had the robot positioned in front of a
panel that consisted of a number of LED lights. The lights would flash
in a random sequence, and the task was to identify the location and color
of the lights in the correct sequence (Figure 1).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12125f1.large.jpg"><img src="12125f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Using RVIZ to Check Line of Sight 
</p></div></div><p>
The mobility task started with the robot standing behind a red line
approximately four meters from a closed door. The robot needed to walk
up to the door, press a button to open the door and then walk through the
door for approximately one meter before ending up past a red line located
on the pathway. The scoring for this task was based solely on the time
it took the robot to walk from red line to red line (Figures 2 and 3).

As you can see, this challenge had two very important features: robots
and space. That was all I needed, but I was soon to find out the challenge
included a third element that was of great interest to me. The operating
platform that the challenge would be working in was Linux-based. In
addition, the challenge would be using the Robotics Operating System
(ROS), a simulation software called Gazebo and the Space Robotics
Challenge Simulation (SRCSim), a predefined simulation that included
the environment for the qualifying tasks, created for the Space Robotics
Challenge by the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e4c48"></a>
Robotics and Linux</h2></div></div><p>
Robots have been around for a long time, and during most of that time, if
you wanted to build your own system, you had to build the hardware, and
you also had to create the software that would control the robot. This
is no small task, and it required several skill sets that not everyone
had. Unfortunately, the need for special skills was a deterrent that
kept potential participants from jumping in to the robotics arena.
</p><p>
These days, there's a tremendous number of robot kits, like those made by
Vex Robotics and Makeblock, which utilize an Arduino controller. Robotics
kits like these greatly have reduced the need to fabricate your own robot;
however, if you possess the necessary talent to fabricate a robot from
scratch, you still can do so. For a long time, what the robotics community
was lacking was a solid software platform with which to work.
</p><p>
In 2006, Microsoft was the first major player to enter the mainstream
robotics software field with Robotics Studio version 1.0. Later, in
2008, Microsoft released Robotics Developer Studio (MRDS). The MRDS is
a Windows-based environment for robot control and simulation. As with
all Microsoft software, it is closed source. The primary programming
language for MRDS is C#. Besides the closed-source nature of the MRDS,
it has been described as overly complicated and requires a great deal
of overhead. Along with that, the latest version, RDS4, has not had
an update on its website since June 2012. A more sustainable solution
was needed. Software sustainability increases when the maximum number
of people are able to access it. Enter the Open Source community, led
by Linux.
</p><p>
In 2007, Willow Garage, a robotics incubator in California, stepped in
to extend work that was done by others, mainly at universities such
as Stanford, to create a well tested implementation of an open-source
operating environment for robotics. Linux, which has a long successful
history on which to rely, was the platform utilized to provide an open-source
foundation.
</p><p>
It makes complete sense that Linux would emerge as the dominant platform
for robotics. The open-source nature of Linux, and by extension ROS, allows
a greater audience to access, develop and maintain a robust environment
for the development and distribution of robotics-related software. Linux
is widely used in academia as well as by home hobbyists. It's free,
it's stable, and it runs on a variety of platforms, without the need
for cutting-edge hardware.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e4f08"></a>
Requirements for the SRC</h2></div></div><p>
The Technical Coordinators for the Space Robotics Challenge had specific
software requirements for the participants of the challenge. The challenge
organizers required teams to use the Linux-based Robot Operating System
(ROS) and the 3D multi-robot simulator software package called Gazebo.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e5010"></a>
Robot Operating System</h2></div></div><p>
ROS is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a
collection of tools, libraries and conventions that aim to simplify
the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide
variety of robotic platforms. The ROS ecosystem now consists of tens of
thousands of users worldwide, working in domains ranging from tabletop
hobby projects to large industrial automation systems.
</p><p>
ROS is mainly targeted for the Ubuntu distribution of Linux. However, the
source code is available for compilation in the many different flavors
of Linux. The Ubuntu distribution provides the easiest implementation
and the most support.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e5170"></a>
Gazebo</h2></div></div><p>
Robot simulation is an essential component in every roboticist's
toolbox. A well designed simulator makes it possible and quick to test
algorithms, design robots, perform regression testing and train
artificial intelligence (AI) systems using realistic scenarios.
</p><p>
Gazebo is a 3D multi-robot simulator that generates both realistic sensor
feedback and physically plausible interactions between objects, and it
includes a highly accurate simulation of rigid-body physics. Gazebo also
offers the ability to simulate populations
of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments accurately and
efficiently. It includes
multiple robust physics engines, high-quality graphics and convenient
programmatic and graphical interfaces. Best of all, Gazebo is free with
a vibrant user community that is constantly adding new simulations as
well as extending existing ones.
</p><p>
Gazebo comes with many built-in robot simulations that are ready to
use. Some of the more interesting ones include the Atlas Robot from
Boston Dynamics; Baxter, an industrial robot, built by Rethink Robotics;
and NASA's Robonaut2. Many more simulations are available, and
all of them are modifiable and extendible by anyone.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e5380"></a>
Installing ROS</h2></div></div><p>
For the SRC, the challenge rules mandated that a specific version of ROS
on a specific version of Ubuntu be used. The moderators of the challenge
wanted everyone to be working in the same environment and, therefore,
face the same challenges and have the same benefits. Specifically,
teams participating in the SRC were going to be using the ROS-Indigo
version targeted for Ubuntu Desktop 14.04 (Trusty 64-bit amd64).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e5488"></a>
Using Docker</h2></div></div><p>
Complying with the SRC technical requirements meant using ROS-Indigo
and the 14.04 version of Ubuntu. At the time, I was running a dual-boot
Windows 10 (I know, forgive me), Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial 64-bit
system. Initially, I thought this would not be a problem, as I had figured
I simply could install a Docker container running Ubuntu 14.04 and the
required versions of ROS and Gazebo.
</p><p>
Docker containers allow you to wrap software in a container that keeps
everything separate from the base operating system. The nice thing about
Docker containers is that there are tons of containers already available
for running various applications. I found a Docker container that was
already configured with Ubuntu 14.04. All I had to do was install Docker
on my 16.04 distribution and then install the 14.04 container. The install
was fast and easy, and even though I had not used Docker previous to this,
I found plenty of instructions on the web on how to set up my container
as well as how to save various versions of the container as I installed
other pieces of software. This allowed me to roll back to a working
version of the software whenever I messed things up.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, even though I was able to install ROS and Gazebo in my
Docker container, I never was able to get the SRC Simulation to run
properly. I spent the better part of a weekend trying to solve the
graphics problems, but in the end, simply gave up in lieu of an easier,
albeit less elegant solution. I installed an additional hard drive in my
computer and created a tri-boot system. Now I could boot into a separate
version of Ubuntu 14.04 and install the necessary software without
worrying about conflicting drivers. As a side note, I could have run
Linux from a USB stick, but I figured I would get better performance
using a hard drive. Plus, I had a spare 1 terabyte drive lying around,
so why not use it.
</p><p>
Installing ROS was a breeze. I simply navigated to the ROS website and
followed the instructions to install the version of ROS targeted for the
indigo distribution of Ubuntu. In less than five minutes, I had a working
version of ROS, complete with tutorials to get me up and running with
total ease.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e5698"></a>
Gazebo Installation</h2></div></div><p>
The SRC also mandated that teams use a specific version of Gazebo. The
version of Gazebo packaged with ROS-Indigo is version 2.x.x; however,
for the SRC, we needed to remove that version and upgrade to the latest
version, which at the time of the SRC was version 7.0.x.
</p><p>
After loading the correct versions of ROS and Gazebo, the next step
was to set up the SRC Simulation. The Open Source Robotics Foundation
(OSRF) created and maintained the SRCSim and they provided a web page
with all of the necessary steps to perform the SRCSim installation and
setup. Links to all of the software needed to run the simulation are
found at the Resources section at end of this article.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e57f8"></a>
Qualification Round</h2></div></div><p>
Once the install of the ROS, Gazebo and SRCSim software was completed
successfully, the teams would be ready to start the actual process of coding
solutions to the two qualifying tasks. The ROS environment allows you
to code in many languages. In fact, you can code in multiple languages
and have them work together seamlessly through the creation of separate
ROS nodes.
</p><p>
ROS nodes are basically pieces of code that help control the robot. Robot
control usually involves multiple nodes. Nodes can control things
like a laser range-finder or the motors associated with wheels on
the robot. Nodes also are used to perform path planning or to provide
a graphical view of the robot's world. For the SRCSim, our team had
nodes that controlled the robot's walking and the robot's arm
movement. We also had a node that controlled the vision system for
identifying LED lights.
</p><p>
The most often used languages for programming nodes are C/C++ and
Python, although C#, Java, Ada and Assembly, along with a variety of
other languages also will work. Our team chose Python mainly because
most of us already had some experience with the language, and because it
is a fairly easy language to pick up if you have never used it before.
</p><p>
The qualifying round lasted approximately three months. Three months is
not a long time when you are working a full-time job and are trying to
find any amount of spare time to work on maximizing robot performance. In
order to utilize our time as efficiently as possible, we split the team
into two sections with each section being responsible for a single
qualifying task. We also had an individual team member float between
the two tasks to pitch in wherever needed.
</p><p>
Working with ROS in the Linux environment involves a good deal of command-line interaction. The ability to open multiple terminals and have each
one dedicated to various operations was a real plus. Many times, I would
have one terminal to launch the simulation, another terminal to produce
output from the robot sensors and still another window to send commands
via messaging to the robot. It was not unheard of to have five or more
terminals open at a time all communicating via the ROS messaging network.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e5b10"></a>
Challenge Results</h2></div></div><p>
More than 400 teams from 55 countries around the world pre-registered for
the Space Robotics Challenge. Of those 400-plus teams, only 92 of
them submitted valid solutions for both qualifying tasks. From the 92
qualifying submissions, 20 teams qualified to move on to participate in
the Virtual Competition set for June 2017.
</p><p>
As a team, our goals for the challenge were simple. First and foremost,
we wanted to have fun. Second, we wanted to learn. Each of us had a
desire to become more proficient using ROS and Gazebo, while others
wanted to get some experience with Linux and Python, having never used
either of them. Finally, we wanted to be competitive. Our goal was to
submit real solutions to the two qualifying tasks in the hope that we
would be in the top 20 and move to the next round of the competition.
</p><p>
I am proud to say, we met all of our goals&mdash;well, almost all of them. We
did submit solutions for both tasks. Unfortunately, we fell short of
qualifying, but we definitely were competitive. All in all, it was a great
experience, and I recommend that anyone who has an interest in robotics
look seriously at utilizing the Linux stack of software mentioned in
this article as a starting point.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26e5cc8"></a>
Team Members</h2></div></div><p>
For the Space Robotics Challenge, my team, named Patriot Robotics,
consisted of myself and four other talented individuals: Erica Kane, Dan
Sionov, Marty Kube and William Marrieta. They were an absolute pleasure
to work with. All of us are amateurs in this arena, and although some
brought a bit more experience to the team than others, we all worked
together very cohesively. I want to thank each of them for making the
experience both rewarding and enjoyable.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x25ec580.0x26dc660"></a>
Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Working on the Space Robotics Challenge and collaborating with my team
was great fun. The truly remarkable thing about participating in the SRC
was that it cost nothing. In fact, for nothing more than the cost of your
time, you can utilize the software mentioned in this article to run the
same simulations that the Space Robotics Challenge used in its qualifying
round. The basics of ROS and Gazebo are pretty easy to pick up. Without
much effort and by using the supplied tutorials as well as other on-line
resources, anyone with little or no experience can set up and run the
software. You even can try your hand at creating solutions and seeing
if you can score well enough to have qualified for the Space Robotics
Challenge. If you do, feel free to email me your results. Good luck!

The TurtleSim Tutorial</b></p><p>
One of the best things about ROS is that it has a very rich tutorial
library. The tutorials are a great way to come up to speed with ROS and
Gazebo. If you are interested in learning ROS, one of the first tutorials
you should try is the turtlesim.
</p><p>
The turtlesim teaches you how to create ROS packages, work with multiple
nodes, publish and subscribe to topics, and work with ROS services.
</p><p>
The tutorial provides step-by-step instructions as well as several
online videos to walk you through the process of setting up and running
the simulation. The simulation involves hands-on programming and command-line interaction through ROS. Learning how to make the simulated turtle
move, rotate or spawn copies of itself are just some of the features
of this tutorial.
</p><p>
The turtlesim is a fun and easy way to get ROS up and running. If for
no other reason than to just control a simulated turtle, I encourage
you to give it a try.
