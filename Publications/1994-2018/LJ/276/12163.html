<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #276, April 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In the quest for ever-larger systems, the Linux kernel has to keep
retooling itself. It's not like other software where you can just
build a data structure that can keep growing without bound. At the OS
level, access to RAM must be as fast as possible. Any unnecessary
slowdown will be multiplied by however much work the system tries to
do.
</p><p>
So, when <span   class="bold"><b>Liang Li</b></span> wanted to raise the
<span   class="bold"><b>x86-64</b></span> limit of 46-bit physical
addresses to 52-bit, he couldn't simply fix the whole problem by
making address size limitless. He had to implement a highly efficient
stop-gap that would tide us over until the next time it needed to be
increased.
</p><p>
In fact, his patch cranked the limit up to 56 bits, which was what the
upcoming hardware would support.
</p><p>
The code hit a snag, however, when <span   class="bold"><b>Paolo
Bonzini</b></span> pointed out that
Liang's implementation might interfere with migrating virtual machines
from one hardware setup to another. The problem, it turned out, boiled
down to a hardware bug that may be difficult to work around. In
particular, using <span   class="bold"><b>LA57 mode</b></span> to access high memory addresses would work
on newer systems but not older ones. Thus, doing even one write with
LA57 mode would make a virtual system impossible to migrate.
</p><p>
This normally would be solved by catching the LA57 calls and rerouting
them to a workaround on older systems. But in this case, that would
reduce efficiency on the older systems, which would make that
particular change very unattractive.
</p><p>
It's possible that this hardware bug may slow down the adoption of
Liang's patch for quite a while. There'll definitely be support for
larger address spaces, but the question of how to go about it has not
yet been answered.
</p><p>
Like security, data integrity is one of those things that trumps all
other considerations. In fact, data integrity might even rank higher
than security in overall importance. Fortunately, I don't think that
choice has ever had to be made.
</p><p>
Security and data integrity do often go hand in hand, however. Recently,
<span   class="bold"><b>Yi Zhang</b></span> described a security exploit that could allow a hostile user
to corrupt data in the <span   class="bold"><b>ext4</b></span> filesystem. Unsurprisingly, Yi's patch is
on the fast track to get in the kernel tree.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Andreas Dilger</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Valdis Kletnieks</b></span> both liked Yi's patch and had
some feature requests. In particular, Valdis wanted the patch, in
addition to preventing the corruption, to alert the user to exactly
which filesystem had been attacked.
</p><p>
Yi had bigger ambitions though. He said that the ext4 exploit existed
in similar form across many other filesystems. He proposed building
the solution into the virtual filesystem (VFS) code itself, where all
filesystems had to pass in order to communicate with the user.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Al Viro</b></span>'s the <span   class="bold"><b>VFS</b></span> guy, and he seemed open to the discussion. At that
point, the conversation moved offline, but clearly, this fix will be
going in somewhere very soon.
</p><p>
The <span   class="bold"><b>RCU</b></span> code in Linux (short for read/copy/update) makes sure that
certain data is available to all CPUs during the boot process, before
any filesystems have been mounted. It's part of the Narnia that is
boot time.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Paul McKenney</b></span> recently posted some patches to make sure that RCU
really made the data available all the way through the boot process,
instead of only at certain specific times. In particular, data is
generally transferred between CPUs at <span   class="bold"><b>Synchronous
Grace Periods</b></span>, which
couldn't be induced properly at a certain phase of the boot process.
Meanwhile, the code that typically induces Synchronous Grace Periods
had begun to activate during that phase, which was leading to
occasional crashes.
</p><p>
Paul posted a patch to make Synchronous Grace Periods work throughout
the whole boot process, and a variety of folks offered comments.
</p><p>
There was some talk from <span   class="bold"><b>Rafael J. Wysocki</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>Borislav Petkov</b></span> and <span   class="bold"><b>Lv
Zheng</b></span> of possibly writing a separate version of Paul's patch for
<span   class="bold"><b>ACPI</b></span>.
The general consensus, however, was that it would overly complicate
the ACPI code in exchange for not much actual benefit. So that was
that.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Kirill A. Shutemov</b></span> recently posted a patch to allow Linux userspace
to access up to 56-bit memory addresses. This dovetails nicely with
Liang Li's work mentioned previously. However, it is apparently much more
controversial. There are many ways to give userspace this ability,
and the impact could affect code all over the kernel. In addition to
speed and security, it's important to make sure that the semantics&mdash;the
ways user code can interact with the kernel&mdash;remain consistent,
or at least clear.
</p><p>
After Kirill's patches, there was a long and wide-ranging
implementation discussion, with <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> ultimately weighing in
on the side of an implementation that was quite different from
Kirill's initial conception. There were a variety of complex proposals
on the table, involving exactly when and how user code could access
high address memory. Predictably, Linus favored an extremely simple
solution from the user perspective, in which anyone who wanted a given
binary to access high address memory simply could compile that binary
with the feature in place.
</p><p>
It's likely that the debate will continue, but at least now there's a
clear baseline. Any prospective solution should present the user with
a similarly simple interface. Any solution that favors elegance or
completeness over that level of simplicity is likely not to make the
cut.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: If Not This Then Stringify</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #276, April 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I love IFTTT (If This Then That: <a href="http://ifttt.com" target="_self">ifttt.com</a>), but
although it usually works
well, it's more and more common for triggers to fail. Sometimes they
don't fail, but take several minutes to activate. When you want a light
to turn on as you enter a room, several minutes of delay clearly
can be a deal-breaker. I'm not sure if the problem is capacity issues or
individual API problems, but I no longer feel confident that IFTTT will fire
reliably. Although it's still in beta, Stringify aims to be more reliable,
but also more robust.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163androidf1.large.jpg"><img src="12163androidf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
(Screenshot from Google Play Store)
</p></div></div><p>
With IFTTT, simplicity is king. You have a single trigger (If...) and a
single action (then that...). With Stringify, you have &ldquo;flows&rdquo;, which
allow multiple results along with conditionals. Basically, you write a
logical flow of triggers and results using the same sorts of triggers
and results IFTTT offers. Granted, the number of connected services is
significantly smaller, but the number is growing all the time. There's
also no web-based interface for the Stringify building process, which bums
me out. I would rather have a big screen to build flows, but it's only
possible to manipulate your account on a mobile device (Android or iOS).
</p><p>
It's not clear whether Stringify will end up being more popular and/or more reliable
than IFTTT. It certainly has the promise to surpass the usefulness of
IFTTT though. At the very least, the idea of competition likely will make both
services strive for excellence. (Perhaps IFTTT will need to add another
&ldquo;T&rdquo; and become &ldquo;If This Then These Things!&rdquo;) 
</p><p>
Thanks to using the idea
of building &ldquo;awesomer&rdquo; ideas on top of already awesome ideas,
Stringify gets this month's Editors' Choice award. Give it a try, and see if
you can push the service hard enough to stress its reliability. I'm hoping
it proves to be a viable alternative to the already awesome IFTTT!

<h2 class="title">Solving Physics Problems on Linux</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #276, April 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Several years ago, I wrote an article on using Elmer to solve complicated
physics problems. Elmer has progressed quite a bit since then, so I thought
it would be worth taking a fresh look at this simulation software
(<a href="https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer" target="_self">https://www.csc.fi/web/elmer</a>).
</p><p>
The
first step is to install Elmer on your system. It may exist within your
package management system, but those are likely older versions. If you are
running a Debian-based system, you can get the latest versions by adding the
Elmer repository to APT and installing it from there:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:elmer-csc-ubuntu/elmer-csc-ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install elmerfem-csc
</pre>
</p><p>
Those steps will conflict with the Elmer packages that exist in the main
Debian repositories, so be sure that they haven't been previously installed
on your system. The meta-package elemerfem-csc also will install a number of
sample files that I use here as part of my description of Elmer's
functionality.
</p><p>
The first step is to start Elmer. Depending on your desktop environment,
there may be an entry within the menu system. If there isn't, open 
a terminal and start it with the command <tt  >ElmerGUI</tt>. 
This command
opens the application and leaves you with an empty workspace. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163elmerf1.large.jpg"><img src="12163elmerf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Executing <tt >ElmerGUI</tt> starts the main application, which
controls all the other steps involved in using Elmer.
</p></div></div><p>
Most programs that
solve physics problems of this type follow three broad steps. The first, or
pre-processing, step involves preparing the problem for solution. This
includes defining any materials and their properties, along with any equations
that describe the processes that will be taking place. This is also when you
would apply a meshing function to break the geometry down into the
subsections that will be used during the actual calculation phase. The
second, or solver, step is when the input data is supplied to the actual
solver functions that apply the equations to the materials described in your
problem. The last, or post-processing, step is where you find the
solution to your problem. Humans interpret graphical information most
easily, so there are tools available in the post-processing step to visualize
the final solution and help you see the results of your problem.
</p><p>
Since Elmer's installation includes a number of sample files, let's go
ahead and use those to explore what kind of work is possible with Elmer.
These files should all be available in the 
/usr/share/ElmerGUI/samples directory, subdivided by the types of files contained
within the samples. 
</p><p>
Let's look at the heat distribution across a pump
section and see how the distribution happens. To start, you will want to
open the pump_carter_sup.stp step file, which is located in the step
subdirectory of the samples directory. When you open this file, it gets
loaded into the ElmerGUI geometry viewer. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163elmerf2.large.jpg"><img src="12163elmerf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The ElmerGUI geometry viewer allows you to see the object you'll
be using during your calculations.
</p></div></div><p>
This viewer allows you
to grab the object with your mouse cursor and rotate it around, so you can get a good
look at it and make sure it's structured properly. This object also
is meshed automatically by ElmerGUI, so that it can be used in the solver
stage. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163elmerf3.large.jpg"><img src="12163elmerf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. ElmerGUI also can handle meshing your objects in the pre-processing
step.
</p></div></div><p>
Here, you can see the set of triangles that have been
mapped onto your object to define the domains on which the solver should operate.
You can verify the actual meshing by clicking the 
Model&rarr;Summary menu item, and look at the top of the output for the summary
information. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163elmerf4.large.jpg"><img src="12163elmerf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. The model summary tells you things like the number of nodes, edges
and volume elements within your model.
</p></div></div><p>
In this case, you can see that the
meshing created 7,862 nodes and 34,195 volume elements. If this isn't fine
enough to handle the accuracy you need, you can click the
View&rarr;Cad model menu item to bring up the geometry viewer again and
then click Model&rarr;Preferences. If you do make any changes,
don't forget to click Mesh&rarr;Remesh to redo the meshing
process. This may take some time if you are adding a significant number of
subsections.
</p><p>
Now that the object is loaded, let's start setting some initial
conditions. For this example, you want to set the temperature on the
inside surfaces of the three holes. You can select surfaces by
double-clicking on them. If you need to select multiple surfaces, simply hold
the Ctrl key down at the same time.
</p><p>
Since you want to treat these three surfaces as a single unit, you'll need to
unify them. You can do this by clicking the Mesh&rarr;Unify
surface menu item. To set initial conditions for the entire problem, 
click the Model&rarr;Setup menu item. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163elmerf5.large.jpg"><img src="12163elmerf5.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. The model setup window allows you to set initial conditions for the
entire model as a whole.
</p></div></div><p>
Here you can set
input and output locations, constants, numbers of iterations or time step
procedures, among many other options. You also need to add the equations that
will define the physical processes you actually are trying to solve for.
</p><p>
Clicking Model&rarr;Equation&rarr;Add opens an editing
window to create a new equation. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163elmerf6.large.jpg"><img src="12163elmerf6.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 6. You can add equations to define the physical processes you are
trying to model.
</p></div></div><p>
In this case, let's just add
a heat equation to calculate how heat flows through this pump part. Since you
need to apply this to the entire object, you can click the apply box for Body
1 here in the equation editor. But, what kind of object is this? Clicking
Model&rarr;Material pops up a window where you can define all
the physical properties of the object. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163elmerf7.large.jpg"><img src="12163elmerf7.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 7. You can set all of the physical properties of the materials used
within your object.
</p></div></div><p>
There also is a button called
Material library that allows you to select from a set of predefined
materials. In this case, let's set the object to be aluminum. As with the
equation editor, you can apply the material type to the object directly here.
</p><p>
Clicking Model&rarr;Body Force pops up a window where you can
enter values that would represent the right-hand side of the equations.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12163elmerf8.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 8. You can set body forces that define forcing values for the
equations being used.
</p></div></div><p>
Clicking the Model&rarr;Boundary Condition menu item will pop
up a new window where you can set boundary conditions for your equations.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="12163elmerf9.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 9. You can set boundary conditions for your equations to be used by
the solver stage.
</p></div></div><p>
In this case, say you want to create a new boundary temperature of
293&deg;Kelvin, which is named RoomTemp. To apply this boundary
condition, go back to the main ElmerGUI interface and
double-click the surface of the inside of the holes again. A small window
will pop up asking you to set a boundary condition, where you can select the
RoomTemp condition that was just set. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163elmerf10.large.jpg"><img src="12163elmerf10.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 10. Select the sections that need to have a boundary condition applied
to it.
</p></div></div><p>
In order to run the solver, you need to generate the final input
file. You can do this by clicking the Sif&rarr;Generate menu item. If you want
to take a look at it, click Sif&rarr;Edit to pop up an
editor window. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163elmerf11.large.jpg"><img src="12163elmerf11.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 11. You can open an editor to manipulate the solver input
file directly.
</p></div></div><p>
You also will need to save the entire project so
that all of the required files are in a single location before starting the
solver. Now, click Run&rarr;Start Solver to start the
whole process. Once it's done, you'll see some new output windows.
The top one is the convergence monitor, showing you how quickly the
solver came to the final solution. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163elmerf12.large.jpg"><img src="12163elmerf12.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 12. After the solver is done, you'll see a window showing how quickly
convergence happened.
</p></div></div><p>
You can visualize the results in the post-processing step.
In this example, click the
Run&rarr;Start ElmerVTK menu item to get one type of visualization. If you also
installed paraview, you can get a very sophisticated visualization
application to look at your output files. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="12163elmerf13.large.jpg"><img src="12163elmerf13.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 13. Paraview can provide sophisticated visualization tools for
your output files.
</p></div></div><p>
This article was just a walk-through of one of the sample problems to show a
small cross-section of the available functionality. 
I hope this article has
whetted your appetite enough to look at the other sample problems and use
them as a jumping-off point for your own research interests.

I love to share images with people quickly. They could be cat photos or
screenshots. Usually I post those silly images to Twitter and Facebook
using Buffer, but occasionally, I just want to send a quick image to
a single person. (This is usually when I'm trying to show my computer
via screenshot.)
</p><p>
When I'm on a Mac, screenshots are really simple with the
Command-Shift-3 keystroke. Sharing them used to mean dragging them to my
Dropbox, and then finding the image and getting a public share link. It's
cumbersome. But, there's a great utility for OS X called Mac2Imgur, which
uploads an image to <a href="http://imgur.com" target="_self">imgur.com</a> and provides a link in the clipboard. It
even has options to remove the image after uploading, so you don't have
100 screenshots on your desktop. It's an incredibly useful utility,
and it's completely open source. 
</p><p>
If you ever share images from a Mac, head
over to <a href="https://github.com/mileswd/mac2imgur" target="_self">https://github.com/mileswd/mac2imgur</a> and grab a copy (and yes,
this screenshot is also on imgur at <a href="https://i.imgur.com/wv28w31.png" target="_self">https://i.imgur.com/wv28w31.png</a>).

<h2 class="title">I'll Gladly Pay You Tuesday for a Hamburger Today</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #276, April 2017</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
My day job pays me on the 15th and last day of every month, unless those
days land on a weekend, in which case I get paid the Friday before. With
those rules, creating a Google Calendar event is shockingly difficult. In
fact, it's not possible to create a recurring event with those rules using
Google's GUI scheduling tool. 
</p><p>
Thankfully, you can import an event from
an .ical file, and Google will understand the more complex schedules. In
my case, I needed two separate events. For the 15th of every month,
with weekends being paid on Friday, here is the .ical file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
BEGIN:VEVENT
DTSTART:20170101
DTEND:20170101
RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;BYMONTHDAY=13
RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=FR;BYMONTHDAY=14
RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYMONTHDAY=15
SUMMARY: Get Paid
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >DTSTART</tt> and <tt  >DTEND</tt> dates are set to when you first want the recurring
event to start. I just started on January 1, 2017. If you read through the
logic, basically the event is placed on Friday if Friday is the 13th,
on Friday if Friday is the 14th and on any weekday that lands on the
15th. The rules are evaluated in order, so if Friday is the 13th or 14th,
the event is scheduled then.
</p><p>
The last day of the month except for weekends was actually a bit more
complicated, but still doable. That event looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
BEGIN:VCALENDAR
BEGIN:VEVENT
DTSTART:20170101
DTEND:20170101
RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1;WKST=MO;
SUMMARY: Get Paid
END:VEVENT
END:VCALENDAR
</pre>
</p><p>
The logic is a little harder to follow,
and I actually had to adapt a post on Stack Overflow
(<a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/10929/how-to-make-a-task-repeat-on-the-last-day-of-each-month-in-google-calendar/17531#17531" target="_self">webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/10929/how-to-make-a-task-repeat-on-the-last-day-of-each-month-in-google-calendar/17531#17531</a>)
to get it to work. They both seem to work flawlessly, so I'm
not complaining.
</p><p>
In order to add them to your calendar, you just save two text files
with the above text. I'm not sure if the .ical extension is required,
but that's the type of file it is, so I recommend using it. Then you
&ldquo;import&rdquo; a calendar, and you'll be asked to which calendar to
add the event.
Unfortunately, if you need to make a change to the schedule, you'll
have to delete the event and re-create/import it, because it can't be
adjusted with the Google GUI. But, the whole point was to have the date
figured out so I wouldn't have to edit it anymore.

For years I've been jealous of folks with iOS devices who could just send
their phone screens to their Apple TV devices. It seems like the Android
screen-mirroring protocols never work right for me. My Sony Xperia has
multiple types of screen mirroring, and none of them seem to work on my
smart TVs or Roku devices.

YouTube is a completely different story. It doesn't matter if I'm on a
laptop, iPhone, Android device or Chromebook, I can &ldquo;cast&rdquo; the video
to any of my Roku devices or smart TVs without any problems at all. It
works and works well. The great part about casting is you can shut off
the connection from the sending device, and it keeps playing! Because 95%
of the stuff I want to display on the TV from my phone is YouTube videos,
I couldn't be happier. Plus, I can check email on my phone while the
family watches the latest &ldquo;Bad Lip Reading&rdquo; video on the big screen! Take
that Apple TV!
