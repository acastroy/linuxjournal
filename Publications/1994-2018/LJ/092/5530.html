    There are worse ways of opposing the Security Systems Standards and Certification Act.

version of the SSSCA being introduced to US legislators,
threatening to make software that is either open source or
source-available illegal, you may be asking yourself what a single
individual can do that will have much effect, short of turning
full-time activist.
</p><p>Technical Editor Don Marti, recently made a comparison
between the now burgeoning fight for the protection of digital
rights and the 1960s fight for environmental protection that
culminated in the formation of the EPA by President Nixon, pointing
out that in our current fight we have opponents who are highly
organized and that if we ourselves are not, we cannot hope to win.
Those who wanted to protect the environment started as simply a
bunch of individuals and small groups and became a powerful
lobbying body and eventually even got a government agency assigned
to protect their interests. Those individuals had at least two
factors that worked to their victory&mdash;fierce opposition and popular
support. The former we have, the latter we lack (at least it's
nowhere near the level it needs to be to win the fight).</p><p>Rachel Carson's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Silent Spring</em></span> was, to a
great extent, responsible for the degree of popular support that
the early environmentalists enjoyed. Lawrence Lessig's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Code</em></span> could play the role of our
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Silent Spring</em></span>, but obviously not nearly enough
people are reading it.</p><p>One reader wrote in (jokingly) advocating a &ldquo;Boston CD
Party&rdquo; where free software supporters would dump CDs, DVDs and
eBook readers into the Boston harbor to call public attention to
the plight of free software. He correctly points out that most of
the general public doesn't use nor understand free software, so
when presented with exaggerated claims by copyright-holding
entertainment companies and the resultant economic &ldquo;damage&rdquo;, many
will be inclined to believe them and see defenders of free software
as would-be thieves. The illogical fear of &ldquo;hackers&rdquo; instilled
into the public consciousness by the popular media doesn't help
either.</p><p>Fortunately the SSSCA has had its predecessors, and these
previous (though less menacing) threats have led to the
establishment of an organization for the protection of rights
digitally expressed and for the education of the public on the
dangers posed by the SSSCA and similar legislation&mdash;the Electronic
Frontier Foundation. This organization has the potential to be a
very powerful lobbying force, but it is up to those whose interests
it strives to protect to support it by becoming members and/or
supporting it with donations. If you want to learn more about the
