the system crashes frequently, something like once a week. The
crashes always occur soon after 4:00 <b  >A.M.</b> (after
cron.daily is executed). Kernel output is</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference

improvement.
</p><p>&mdash;Atsuko Crum, acrum@hood.edu</p><p>I had similar problems with a different distribution but a
2.4.x kernel. It turned out that a BIOS upgrade for the motherboard
took care of most of my problems. Although I still have similar
occurrences, they are much less frequent.</p><p>&mdash;David Brown, david@caldera.com</p><p>While hardware problems can happen at any time, if this
started after you upgraded, you should try downgrading the kernel
to the version you had on Red Hat 7.0, or if you don't mind
rebuilding a kernel, you can try getting the latest 2.4 available
(2.4.10 at the time of this writing). Many bugs were fixed in the
first versions of the 2.4 kernel. If you want to rule out hardware
issues, you can try an excellent stress tester, Cerberus, which you
can get from SourceForge at

installation to proceed. I could not believe it because I had 10GB
reserved. I partitioned my hard drive like this:</p><p>5GB WinNT 4.0512MB for root512MB for swap4GB for usr4GB for
home</p><p>&mdash;Cheppy, banggae@fisika.ui.ac.id</p><p>After formatting your partitions and setting up their
mountpoints, switch to a second virtual console (Alt-F2) and
verify, using df or mount, that they actually are mounted. If not,
you will be installing Slackware on your 512MB root partition. That
size may be too small if you are installing X or other large
applications.</p><p>&mdash;Chad Robinson, crobinson@rfgonline.com</p><p>I am betting here that you are mislabeling the / (root) with
a /root label. Try labeling your partitions like this: 5GB WinNT
4.0512MB /512MB swap4GB /usr4GB /home That should give you adequate
space for the installation.</p><p>&mdash;Paul Christensen, pchristensen@penguincomputing.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1811580.0x1909c90"></a>PAM on Slackware?</h2></div></div><p>As I install more applications on my Slackware server for my
users, I find that many require authentication, but there are a few
that don't read data from the passwd file. The result is that users
need to change their password in multiple locations.</p><p>There seems to be a movement toward PAM and LDAP so that if I
could switch to support them, users could change their password to
all of the services, including Samba, e-mail, pppd and phpgroupware
from one location (such as a web-based password change
application). However, Slackware doesn't support PAM, and I can't
find a HOWTO to install PAM.</p><p>&mdash;Brian Johnson, bjohnson@jecinc.on.ca</p><p>It is possible to install PAM on a non-PAM-aware
distribution, but it involves, among other things, replacing all
your applications that do authentication with PAM-aware ones (and
if your distribution doesn't provide them, you have to get the
source, find PAM patches if they're not integrated and recompile
everything with the right options for your system). It is a lot of
work, and unless you're looking for a special challenge, I
recommend you switch to a modern distribution like Debian Linux or
Red Hat Linux (which both support PAM natively). Those are only two
examples; many other distributions support PAM too.</p><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1811580.0x1909ef8"></a>SCSI Emulation for Just One Drive</h2></div></div><p>I have an HP IDE CD-Writer, so I am using SCSI emulation to
use it with cdrecord. Under the 2.2.18 kernel, I could tell the
ide-scsi module only to make use of my burner and leave my ATAPI
CD-ROM alone. I did this via an append option in lilo.conf:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
append="hdc=ide-scsi"
</pre><p>This worked well, as /dev/hdc is my burner and /dev/hdd is my
ATAPI CD-ROM. Unfortunately, under the 2.4 kernel, this no longer
works. The ide-scsi module grabs both devices, making /dev/hdd
unavailable, preventing cdparanoia from working with it and forcing
me to mount it with /dev/scd1. How do I get the same effect under
2.4 and force the ide-scsi module to emulate only /dev/hdc?
</p><p>&mdash;Michael Soulier, michael.soulier@home.com</p><p>What you want is for hdc to do SCSI emulation and hdd to
continue to be used as an IDE device. Usually IDE-CD support is
disabled and SCSI emulation is enabled so that both drives are seen
as SCSI devices. See

hosts). I always try to install the bare minimum of packages during
an install, figuring that if I don't include something the customer
decides they want later, I can always figure out how to add it.
Occasionally, a package requested will have such a fun list of
dependencies requested that what should be a simple <b  >rpm
-ivh package.rpm</b> becomes a 30 minute dependency adding
game. Is there a simple switch I can enter to have RPM tell me what
one package needs before I try to install it?</p><p>&mdash;Bruce D. Meyer, gh1@rocsoft.net</p><p>You describe one of the reasons why many Linux server
administrators use Debian Linux instead of a Red Hat derivative.
With Debian, it is just a matter of typing <b  >apt-get install
foo</b>. Last I checked, RPM doesn't have a magic switch to
do what you want. One way to do this on Red Hat is to use gnorpm or
rpmfind. The problem is that in either case, with RPM-based
solutions, RPMs are often incompatible across distributions and
even within different versions of the same distribution (like RH
6.2 and RH 7.1). While rpmfind/gnorpm will probably be your best
bet, if you get the option to install Debian Linux next time, it
would solve all these problems.</p><p>&mdash;Marc Merlin, marc_bts@valinux.com</p><p>One little gem is Red Carpet. Documentation and downloads can
