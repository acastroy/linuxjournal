    The threat of Microsoft's shared-source licenses.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1885580.0x197d608"></a></h2></div></div><p>A few proprietary software vendors argue
that there is something almost un-American about free software and
the GPL. Microsoft has been one of the loudest voices in that
chorus of fear. That company's web site describes it this way:
<div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The GNU General Public License (GPL)...poses a
significant threat to the IP base of companies seeking to build a
business around GPL-covered software. Even businesses who may
believe they are &ldquo;mere users&rdquo; of GPL software are threatened
since they combine what they believe to be separate applications
with GPL code. This licensing model has the effect of foreclosing a
business' choice of what IP to share with the community and on what
terms
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/business/licensing/ssfaq.asp" target="_self">www.microsoft.com/business/licensing/ssfaq.asp</a>).</p></blockquote></div>

I've already argued elsewhere (see
<a href="http://www.rosenlaw.com/html/GPL.PDF" target="_self">www.rosenlaw.com/html/GPL.PDF</a>)
that this supposed GPL threat is hogwash. But, there's a deeper
irony to this: Microsoft's own shared-source license is an even
greater threat to the software development community. That license
is a Trojan horse license that can destroy your open-source and
proprietary software unless you are very careful.
</p><p>The simplest version of Microsoft's shared-source licenses is
the one they use to distribute their Windows CE 3.0 source code.
That license states, in its second paragraph, &ldquo;You can use this
software for any noncommercial purpose, including distributing
derivatives.&rdquo; The license then makes it clear that running your
business operations &ldquo;would not be considered
noncommercial&rdquo;.</p><p>Commercial users&mdash;and I consider most open-source software
developers to be in that category&mdash;must look further in the license
to determine the restrictions on use that apply to them. The third
paragraph of the license conveys the bad news:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>For commercial purposes, you can reference this
software solely to assist in developing and testing your own
software and hardware for the Windows CE platform. You may not
distribute this software in source or object form for commercial
purposes under any circumstances.</p></blockquote></div><p>Note that Microsoft has not given you permission to copy
their code or to incorporate it into your own software in a
derivative work. Your use of their software for commercial purposes
is limited to reference purposes only.
</p><p>Obviously, you can agree not to make a copy of any portion of
the Microsoft software or to use it to create derivative works. But
what happens if later you, independently and without consciously
remembering what you saw in Microsoft's code, create something
substantially the same as their code? Can you still be liable for
infringement?</p><p>That's where the Trojan horse comes into play. The courts
have made it clear that, under copyright law, proof of substantial
similarity between your work and another work, along with proof of
access to the other work, may be enough to prove infringement, even
when you don't realize that you're making a copy.</p><p>How easy is it to forget something important that you read? A
copyright infringement case from the 1970s will illustrate the
problem. In 1976, George Harrison's music company was sued for
copyright infringement. A music publisher claimed that Harrison
plagiarized his successful song, &ldquo;My Sweet Lord&rdquo;, from an earlier
successful song, &ldquo;He's So Fine&rdquo;. In order to prove copyright
infringement, the publisher of &ldquo;He's So Fine&rdquo; had to prove not
only that there was &ldquo;striking similarity&rdquo; between the two songs,
but that Harrison had copied the original song when composing his.
Harrison admitted that he was familiar with the original song, but
that while he was working on &ldquo;My Sweet Lord&rdquo; he wasn't conscious
of the fact that he was using the &ldquo;He's So Fine&rdquo; melody. The
court concluded:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In seeking musical materials to clothe his
thoughts...there came to the surface of [Harrison's] mind a
particular combination that pleased him....Did Harrison
deliberately use the music of &ldquo;He's So Fine&rdquo;? I do not believe he
did so deliberately. Nevertheless, it is clear that &ldquo;My Sweet
Lord&rdquo; is the very same song as &ldquo;He's So Fine&rdquo; with different
words, and Harrison had access to &ldquo;He's So Fine&rdquo;. This is, under
the law, infringement of copyright, and is no less so even though
subconsciously accomplished.
</p><p>&mdash;Bright Tunes Music Corp. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd., 420
F.Supp. 177 (S.D.N.Y. 1976).</p></blockquote></div><p>Subsequently, Harrison's music company was found liable for
some $1.6 million in damages.
</p><p>Anyone familiar with the art of computer programming will
recognize that, as with music, there are rather standard ways to
express certain thoughts. Having once seen Microsoft's code, will
an expert programmer be able to erase that example from his mind?
Even if he or she consciously attempts to forget and does not
intend to copy, will his or her subconscious memories be expressed
in his later code with sufficient similarity that a court will find
copyright infringement has occurred?</p><p>I encourage open-source programmers to avoid that risk. Don't
look at source code licensed under Microsoft's shared-source
licenses unless you're one of the rare breed of humans who can
control his or her subconscious.</p><p>Legal advice must be provided in the course of an
