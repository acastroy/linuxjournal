    Reuven introduces an infrastructure for creating distributedapplications using JBoss, the Java application server.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6f580.0xf67660"></a></h2></div></div><p>As web applications become more serious,
developers have become increasingly demanding about their tools.
Over the last two months, we looked at two object-to-relational
mapping tools (Alzabo and DODS) that make it possible to work with
databases using object methods, avoiding the use of SQL inside of
your program.
</p><p>But there are a number of issues that many of these
object-relational mapping tools fail to address: how can objects be
separated onto different computers? Once separated, how can objects
find each other? And if an object's state reflects the state of one
or more database rows, how do we handle transactions?</p><p>These are messy and difficult questions, and we can expect to
wrestle with them for years to come. One of the most comprehensive
answers to these questions (and many others) is the J2EE (Java 2
Enterprise Edition) platform and its Enterprise JavaBeans object
model. EJB, as it is known, is designed for use in complex,
large-scale web sites and reduces the need for programmers to
handle infrastructure issues.</p><p>This month, we will begin to look at EJB as implemented by
the JBoss application server. JBoss is distributed under the GNU
Lesser General Public License (LGPL), does not require much memory
and is relatively easy to use. As is often the case with Java
programming projects, working with EJB requires learning and
working with a new set of tools, configuring several XML files in
the right way and making sure that your CLASSPATH contains the
right values during compilation and at runtime. If you can overcome
these logistical hurdles, then JBoss provides an excellent basis
for working with a powerful set of server-side technologies.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6f580.0xf67870"></a>Java, Enhydra and Other Problems</h2></div></div><p>Before we continue, it's important to stress that neither EJB
nor the Java language are truly free software. While you might not
have to pay to download Java or the J2EE libraries, Sun owns
everything having to do with Java, including the specifications.
Sun's Community Source License is more open than many other
licenses, but it is far from an open-source license.</p><p>This is particularly evident now that Lutris Corporation, who
sponsored the open-source Enhydra application server, has pulled
the plug on its J2EE-certified Enhydra Enterprise server. Lutris
has turned Enhydra Enterprise into a closed-source project,
claiming that Sun's license makes it impossible to deliver a fully
compliant, open-source J2EE server. There has been a great deal of
anger (and defensiveness) on the main Enhydra e-mail list, and many
unanswered questions remain. Perhaps Lutris was legally (and
financially) obligated to do what they did, but the manner in which
they did it is an example of how not to close down an open-source
project.</p><p>Luckily, the JBoss team has made it clear that JBoss will
continue to be an open-source project, and that it will continue to
grow and support all of the J2EE standards even if it lacks the
official J2EE certification, largely because of the money required
to receive such approval from Sun.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6f580.0xf67a28"></a>What Is EJB?</h2></div></div><p>A good first question to ask is, &ldquo;Why would I need EJB?&rdquo;
And indeed, there are many applications for which EJB is overkill.
However, EJB provides functionality that would be difficult for us
to implement on our own, inside of the server or container as it is
known:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>EJBs can reside on the same computer as your
application, or on a remote computer. Thus, you can create
multitiered applications in which each tier sits on a different
computer, and your software continues to run unaltered as you move
it from computer to computer or change the configuration of one or
more tiers.</p></li><li><p>The EJB container can handle object-relational
mapping issues for you. You define the database tables and the
objects that map to them, and the container can handle the rest. Or
if you prefer to fine-tune things yourself, you can let your bean
manage its own persistence layer.</p></li><li><p>Relational databases provide transactions, allowing
you to treat two or more operations as if they were a single
operation. EJB gives your objects similar transactional
capabilities, making it possible for a method to perform multiple
actions as an all-or-nothing group.</p></li></ul></div><p>It is also important to understand what EJB is not; despite
the similar names, Enterprise JavaBeans have almost nothing to do
with run-of-the-mill JavaBeans. JavaBeans have a standard API that
allows us to access them from JSPs using little or no code. EJBs,
by contrast, are designed to be used from any Java program,
including servlets. Moreover, the standard API for EJBs is more
rich, complex and flexible than that of JavaBeans. It's unfortunate
that the term JavaBeans has been overloaded by these two popular
server-side technologies, but there isn't anything we can do about
it now.</p><p>One of the most compelling arguments for EJB is that the API
is standard across application servers. Thus, you can begin working
with an open-source EJB server such as JBoss, and then deploy on a
commercial server when the time is ripe. (Although once you learn
how much commercial servers cost, you may want to reconsider
switching away from JBoss.)</p><p>Perhaps the most annoying part of working with Java is the
great number of acronyms, project names and version numbers you
must remember. This article works with the JDK (Java Development
Kit) 1.3 and JBoss 2.4.1a server, which implements the EJB 1.1
standard. Moreover, while it is not particularly difficult to write
the EJB classes themselves, the logistics associated with compiling
and deploying them can be annoying and difficult for the
uninitiated.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6f580.0xf67ea0"></a>Working with EJBs</h2></div></div><p>Basing your application on EJBs means moving as much of the
business logic into separate objects as possible. In EJB, these
objects come in two different flavors:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Entity beans are objects that map to a relational
database. Each instance of an entity bean typically corresponds to
a single row in a database table. Each instance variable
corresponds to a single column in the database table. We normally
need to define a table in our database to correspond to our entity
bean, but the EJB container writes and executes SELECT, INSERT,
UPDATE and DELETE queries according to our needs.</p></li><li><p>Session beans perform actions, by themselves or by
using one or more entity beans. Session beans normally have no
state of their own, which makes them more efficient than entity
beans. However, there are times when it might help to keep some
state around within a session bean. For this reason, EJB offers the
stateful session bean, whose state is kept around between
invocations.</p></li></ul></div><p>If we were to create an on-line forum using EJBs, we probably
would have to define entity beans (and the corresponding tables)
for users, threads and postings. We also would have to define
session beans that support adding, modifying and deleting each of
these types of entity beans and for retrieving entire threads and
individual postings.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6f580.0xf681b8"></a>Installing JBoss</h2></div></div><p>JBoss is a Java application server that makes it possible to
create and deploy multitier J2EE applications. JBoss doesn't
pretend to handle the application side of things; for that, you
will need to use Jakarta-Tomcat or another servlet container. But
JBoss does provide the back-end features, such as a directory
service and messaging service, as well as the EJB container.</p><p>Installing JBoss is extremely easy, assuming that you already
have installed the JDK. Sun provides a copy of the JDK in RPM
format, which you can download from
<a href="http://java.sun.com" target="_self">java.sun.com</a>. You also
will need to download and install the Ant utility, a Java program
meant to replace the venerable UNIX make program. If you are
familiar with make and XML, you will find Ant's build.xml format as
shown in Listing 1 [available at
<a href="../listings/092/5497.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue92/5497.tgz</a>]
to be relatively straightforward.</p><p>Once you have installed the JDK and Ant, installing JBoss is
a cinch. I downloaded the binary code from &lt;j
href=&ldquo;http://boss.org&rdquo; target=&ldquo;_blank&rdquo;&gt;boss.org, opting for the
integrated JBoss and Jakarta-Tomcat support. The file comes as a
zip archive, meaning that you'll need the Info-Zip utilities (which
come with all Linux distributions that I've used) to unpack
them.</p><p>When unpacked, the JBoss-Jakarta distribution contains two
subdirectories, appropriately named jboss and tomcat. Set the
JBOSS_DIST environment variable to point to the jboss directory, so
that various JBoss-related utilities and features will be able to
find the appropriate files.</p><p>At this point, you can start the JBoss server with the
following two commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
cd $JBOSS_DIST/bin
sh run.sh
</pre><p>By default, JBoss logs quite a bit of information to the
terminal window.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6f580.0xf68580"></a>Writing the Calculator Bean</h2></div></div><p>Our first EJB will be Calculator, a stateless session bean
whose multiply() method takes two integers and returns their
product. After writing Calculator and its necessary EJB interfaces,
we will see how we can use it from within a standalone Java
program.</p><p>Writing a simple Calculator class with a multiply method
normally would not be very difficult. We would create the file
Calculator.java and define a method with the following
signature:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
public int multiply (int num1, int num2)
</pre><p>EJB allows us to find and invoke our Calculator bean
remotely, which means that we must write several classes that make
it possible to find Calculator. In the end, our application will
manipulate a remote reference to the actual Calculator bean, rather
than the object itself. Writing a session bean thus involves
writing one Java class and two interfaces.
</p><p>The Java class is the bean class itself, which performs the
actual work. The bean class doesn't know that it has been invoked
by an object on another computer; it can learn about its
environment by querying its &ldquo;context&rdquo; but normally doesn't need
to do that very much. The bean class typically is called the EJB's
simple name, with the word Bean attached. The bean class for our
Calculator EJB is thus CalculatorBean, defined in the file
CalculatorBean.java. The bean class must implement either the
SessionBean or EntityBean interface, depending on what type of bean
it is.</p><p>The first interface is the remote interface, which allows the
application to locate and get a reference to the Calculator EJB.
The remote interface traditionally is given a simple name, such as
Calculator and thus is defined in the file Calculator.java. The
remote interface should define a method for each public method in
the bean class. The remote interface must extend the EJBObject
class.</p><p>The second interface is the home interface, which allows the
EJB container to create, locate, destroy and otherwise manage an
Enterprise JavaBean. The home interface is traditionally given the
same name as the remote interface, with the word Home attached. The
name of our EJB's home interface is thus CalculatorHome, which we
define in the file CalculatorHome.java. The home interface must
extend the EJBHome class.</p><p>One of the nice things about EJB is that your classes can
rely on the default EJB behavior much of the time. This might not
be the most efficient way to go about things, but it allows us to
focus on writing the functional part of our code, allowing the EJB
container to handle almost all of the infrastructure.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6f580.0xf688f0"></a>Writing the Classes</h2></div></div><p>Now that we understand which classes we have to create, we
can begin to write some code. You'll quickly notice that there is
not that much code to write, and that in the case of our
CalculatorBean class, many of our methods are defined with empty
bodies. This is because the SessionBean interface, from which
CalculatorBean inherits, forces us to define these methods, even if
our bean is simple enough not to use them. Using empty method
bodies fulfills our obligations to the interface, while keeping our
class simple.</p><p>I put all of the Java source files in the
il.co.lerner.calculator package, reflecting the fact that they come
from my commercial domain and that this is the calculator project.
As such, all of the .java source files are in a directory hierarchy
il/co/lerner/calculator.</p><p>Our bean class, CalculatorBean (see Listing 2), defines a
single multiply() method, which takes two integer inputs and
returns an integer to its caller. Other than implementing the
SessionBean interface, CalculatorBean really doesn't have much to
do with EJB; indeed, it is a fairly boring class with a single
method. Anything we write to System.out will be printed to the
JBoss session log.</p><p><a href="5497l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2. CalculatorBean.java, the
Bean Class for Our EJB Calculator</a></p><p>Our home interface, CalculatorHome, allows us to create a new
instance of CalculatorBean. Other than defining the interface's
signature, including the fact that it returns an instance of the
remote interface (Calculator), the home interface is extremely
short:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
package il.co.lerner.calculator;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import javax.ejb.CreateException;
import javax.ejb.EJBHome;
public interface CalculatorHome extends EJBHome
{
   Calculator create() throws RemoteException,
   CreateException;
}
</pre><p>Finally, our remote interface, Calculator, lists one method
signature for each public method in CalculatorBean:
<pre     class="programlisting">
package il.co.lerner.calculator;
import javax.ejb.EJBObject;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
public interface Calculator extends EJBObject
{
    public int multiply(int num1, int num2) throws
    RemoteException;
}
</pre>


Client programs will be invoking methods via the remote interface,
rather than directly on the bean. The signatures for the remote
interface and the bean class must match, or you will encounter
serious problems later on.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6f580.0xf68cb8"></a>Deploying the Bean</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have defined them, we can deploy our Calculator
session bean to our running JBoss server. Deploying our session
bean means taking all of its elements and turning them into a
single Java archive (jar) file. Our .jar file will contain the
compiled classes for Calculator, CalculatorHome and
CalculatorBean.</p><p>But, it will also contain a &ldquo;deployment descriptor&rdquo;, an XML
file named ejb-jar.xml that describes the contents of the .jar file
to the EJB container. Deployment descriptors are a mandatory part
of the EJB standard and do not vary from one application server to
another. They tell the EJB container the names of the interfaces
and classes that we have chosen, and also allow us to define such
items as the type of transactions our bean will support. The
deployment descriptor for our Calculator EJB is in Listing 3 and
should be placed in the same directory as the .java source
files.</p><p><a href="5497l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. ejb-jar.xml, the
Deployment Descriptor for Our Calculator Bean</a></p><p>Our .jar file will also contain a short XML file named
jboss.xml, which we will place alongside ejb-jar.xml:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;jboss&gt;
  &lt;enterprise-beans&gt;
    &lt;session&gt;
      &lt;ejb-name&gt;Calculator&lt;/ejb-name&gt;
      &lt;jndi-name&gt;calculator/Calculator&lt;/jndi-name&gt;
    &lt;/session&gt;
  &lt;/enterprise-beans&gt;
&lt;/jboss&gt;
</pre><p>The jboss.xml file is specific to JBoss, binding our bean to
the Java's Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI). With jboss.xml in
place, a client program that asks JNDI for calculator/Calculator
will get a reference to it in return.
</p><p>We could build the .jar file by hand, but it's easier to use
Ant to build the .jar file and deploy it into the right place.
Listing 1
[<a href="../listings/092/5497.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue92/5497.tgz</a>]
contains an Ant build.xml that supports the targets ejb-jar (the
default) and deploy. If you place build.xml in $CALCULATOR, then
your .java files, ejb-jar.xml and jboss.xml should be in
$CALCULATOR/il/co/lerner/calculator. Ant will place the results of
compilation in $CALCULATOR/build/calculator, as specified in the
build.calculator.dir property in build.xml.</p><p>With Ant installed in $ANT, we can compile our .java files,
turn them into an EJB-compliant .jar file (with the ejb-jar.xml
file in the mandatory META-INF directory) and deploy it to JBoss
with the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ANT/bin/ant deploy
</pre><p>You should see a number of messages on the screen describing
the compilation and deployment process. If the compilation or build
fails, check that your environment variables are set correctly,
that the Java files don't have any syntax errors and that the
directories have appropriate permissions.
</p><p>If your JBoss server already is running before you deploy the
Calculator .jar file, you will notice that it automatically detects
and deploys the file without any need for restart. This is one of
the great pleasures of JBoss; in order to deploy your EJB .jar
file, you simply copy it into the $JBOSS_DIST/deploy
directory.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6f580.0xf5fa70"></a>Writing an Application</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have deployed our Calculator EJB, let's write a
short Java program that uses it. Listing 4 contains the source code
for such a class, UseCalculator.java.</p><p><a href="5497l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. UseCalculator.java, Which
Connects to and Uses Our Calculator EJB</a></p><p>While our program is completely independent from our EJB
classes and can be compiled and run separately (or even on a
separate computer), we use Ant to keep track of the CLASSPATH
(which must include the JBoss classes, as well as those from our
.jar file), compile our code and then run it. In order to run our
application, we simply can say</p><pre     class="programlisting">
$ANT/bin/ant use-calculator-ejb
</pre><p>This runs our program after ensuring that our EJB is
compiled, turned into a .jar file and deployed.
</p><p>Anything that UseCalculator.main() writes to System.out (also
known as the stdout filehandle) is printed on the screen when we
run Ant. However, anything that our CalculatorBean method writes to
stdout is printed to the JBoss logging output. By keeping JBoss
open in one terminal window and running Ant in another, we can see
them communicate with each other.</p><p>UseCalculator's main() method consists of several standard
steps for connecting to and using our EJB. We first connect to
JNDI, which keeps track of the objects currently deployed to JBoss.
This connection is known as a context. Our program looks for
jndi.properties, a short Java properties file that tells it where
it can go to find a context (this file should be placed in
$CALCULATOR/resources/, as specified in build.xml). This file is in
Java resources format, where every line contains name=value:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
java.naming.factory.initial=
java.naming.provider.url=localhost:1099
java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces
</pre><p>Once we have our context, we look up our object using the
name that we gave it in jboss.xml, which is inside of our
ejb-jar.xml. Without jboss.xml, JBoss will not associate the right
name with our EJB, making it impossible to find using JNDI.
</p><p>JNDI returns an object reference, which we then cast into an
instance of CalculatorHome, which is then used to create an
instance of Calculator. Notice how we create an instance of
Calculator (the remote interface), rather than one of
CalculatorBean. The remote interface provides us with a transparent
connection to an instance of CalculatorBean on the server, wherever
that might be. At no time do we actually know where the real
instance of CalculatorBean resides.</p><p>Finally, we invoke one of the methods that has been defined
in Calculator (the remote interface). Our method invocation is
passed along to CalculatorBean (the bean class), where it executes
(and prints out some logging information) and returns (where we
print the result to stdout).</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xe6f580.0xf5ff40"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>This month we started to look at Enterprise JavaBeans, an
infrastructure for creating distributed applications using Java.
While EJB is far more complex than SOAP, XML-RPC or other
distributed object systems, it is also designed to handle more
complicated tasks. (For example, SOAP doesn't attempt to handle
transactions; that's left to the application layer to
implement.)</p><p>At the same time, working with Java often means spending more
time on administrative and logistical issues, rather than on
programming. Determining which file must be in which directory can
often be frustrating, especially if you are used to working with a
more dynamic language such as Perl or Python. Nevertheless, the
pain quickly subsides when you see how easily you can create
distributed applications with EJB. The fact that JBoss is so easy
to download, install and run, and has a very small memory
footprint, makes it simple for newcomers to try EJB.</p><p>Next month, we will continue working with EJB, looking at the
heart of EJB, the entity beans that provide an object interface to
our relational databases.</p><p><a href="5497s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
