    It can write tape faster than your disk subsystem can supply data.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x17c3580.0x18bb710"></a></h2></div></div><p>The HP Ultrium 230 low-voltage
differential (LVD) tape drive is fast. It can write tape faster
than your disk subsystem can supply data. If you want to stream,
you'll need several systems feeding it at once, which made it a
good choice for our application of backing up several systems each
night. The 230 is about twice as fast as the 215 model, but also
costs significantly more.
</p><p>We bought one of the first HP Ultrium generation 1 tape
drives, together with the Qualstar TLS-8211 tape library robot.
Both are connected to an Adaptec PCI SCSI controller. It has been
in service since December 2000, and we have done both file and
system restores for the systems it protects.</p><p>The robot and tape drive are available in standalone and
rackmount configurations. We ultimately chose the rackmount, and I
advise others to do the same: something this big sitting on the
floor will draw attention from the cleaning people. In the rack,
the device occupies 36.75" (21U) of space, and it is a two-man job
to get it installed. It is best to mount the cabinet with the
robot, and then install the tape drive and magazine. The magazine
has an 11-tape capacity. The tape drive slides easily into place
once the cabinet is mounted.</p><p>Our selection of the device was driven by two considerations.
First, the device had to be able to hold all of our data. The
single-largest server potentially holds over 200GB of data,
uncompressed, and the other servers roughly match that. The second
requirement was that the data had to be written during the
off-hours. We cannot have backups running during the day. We prefer
full backups; restoration is much simpler in this case. Since
periodic full backups must be made anyway, we do it
consistently.</p><p>This drove us to a trial of the LVD tape subsystem, which
promised to write 50GB/hour and hold 100GB (raw) on a tape. Our
informal tests show that the drive can really stream data at these
speeds. Unfortunately, these same tests show that none of our
systems can supply data at this rate! The tape drive can accept
data far, far faster than a RAID-5 controller can supply
them.</p><p>Our solution was to prepare a backup aggregation program. It
collects backup streams from several computers and writes them all
to tape together with headers identifying their origins. Several
computers, combining their efforts, come closer to keeping the tape
drive streaming. A companion program deaggregates the streams,
providing the desired stream for restoration. Each system supplies
a tar stream, and on restore the system receives the same.</p><p>Our installation combined the tape drive with a tape-loading
robot. We use the mtx program to operate the robot, under the
control of a fairly simple shell script. The shell script
determines the next tape number, invokes the robot to load the
tape, and starts the backup program. When the tape program is done,
another script unloads the tape. For convenience, we throw a sheet
on the printer showing the date and tape number used.</p><p>The robot and tape drive can be moody, and like small
children will misbehave in order to receive attention. Loading and
unloading the tape require care. If not done correctly, the
subsystem will achieve a state in which one must manually extract
the tape. Sometimes a power cycle is even required.</p><p>The tape drive tracks usage to decide when it needs cleaning.
When the tape drive wants to be cleaned, it really wants to be
cleaned: be sure you have a cleaning tape in the shop.</p><p>Preparing to use a tape consists of two stages: directing the
robot to pick a tape and put it in the drive, and then encouraging
the tape drive to do the actual load. The mtx command handles the
former. In order to use the tape, however, you must then wait for
it to become ready. We use a shell loop, waiting until the mt
rewind command returns successfully when the drive has loaded the
tape.</p><p>After the tape is written, we want to unload it and put it
back in the magazine. Normally, when the tape-writing program
finishes and closes the device, it will wait some time for the tape
to rewind. The tape will be left in a loaded state, and in this
drive the robot cannot remove it and return it to the
magazine.</p><p>You must use <b  >mt rewoffl</b> or something
similar to ensure that the tape is rewound and unloaded. Our
experience is that, due to the length of the tape, the first
issuance of the command may return prematurely. To avoid problems,
wait several seconds and re-issue the command. The rule &ldquo;This
time, for sure!&rdquo; applies.</p><p>Only when the tape is really unloaded can the robot pluck it
from the drive and return it to the magazine. We have found that
occasionally, if the robot tries to pluck the tape prior to
unloading, the tape drive will get grumpy. This can sometimes be
cured by manually pressing the unload button and waiting; it is
often necessary to cycle power and then press the unload
button.</p><p>So as long as you don't do anything to upset its routine, the
robot will take good care of your tapes. The drive is big and fast.
If you have a regular need to back up a lot of data, this
combination may be right for you.</p><p>The tape drive and library are available from Zzyzx. They
were kind enough to provide us with an evaluation unit that we kept
for about a month, in order to determine suitability. We found that
we would require the optional bar code reader, and we preferred a
rackmount model over the freestanding unit. Zzyzx took back the
evaluation unit and supplied the rackmount unit, with a bar code
reader. While we have not needed to do so, the unit can be
painlessly upgraded with a second tape drive, and/or more tape
cartridges.</p><p><a href="5412s1.html" target="_self">Product Information/The Good/The
