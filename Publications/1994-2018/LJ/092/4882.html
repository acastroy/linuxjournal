    The best way to stop the spread of e-mail-based viruses is not to let them into your system.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x13c0580.0x14b8558"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the most threatening and
irritating problems I deal with as a network administrator is
viruses. It seems that the virus threat has increased tenfold over
the last couple of years. I have found it increasingly unnerving to
see what the newer viruses are capable of doing. It's not even
their ability that is most disturbing, it's the ease with which
they get into our systems. Recently I spent two hours cleaning the
MTX and Navidad viruses off of a user's machine.
</p><p>The usual first approach that administrators take in virus
prevention is to install a desktop virus protection program. That
is wise, but it seems to me the most fail-safe way to protect a
corporate network from viruses is to prevent their entrance into
the system in the first place. By far the most common entry point
for viruses, especially macro viruses, is corporate e-mail systems.
However, this is usually the most neglected piece in any virus
detection solution. The e-mail virus software on the market today
is often application-specific, expensive or both (not to mention
unreliable). Being a mid-sized business, we did not have it in our
budget this year to buy an antivirus suite off the shelf, so I
turned to Linux and open source. I did find a couple of interesting
projects on the Internet that might meet our needs, but I decided
to write my own instead. I wanted our system to be extremely easy
to follow and easy to extend without a user having to know C or be
a Perl guru. Also, I wanted the system to take advantage of the
power of the utilities that every base Linux installation usually
has. All of this would ensure that another could administer the
system in my absence and that it would be portable.</p><p>The basic outline of the system consists of using Bash
scripts, metamail, grep, the Obtuse Systems' smtpd product, Samba
and a command-line virus scanner. A flowchart-style diagram can be
found in Figure 1. The Obtuse Systems' SMTP store and forward
package is freely available at
<a href="http://www.obtuse.com/smtpd.html" target="_self">www.obtuse.com/smtpd.html</a>.
The current version as of this writing is version 2.0. The virus
scanner I chose was McAfee Virus Scan for UNIX/Linux, but there are
quite a few others to choose from. Some are free and some are not.
Do make sure you choose one that sets exit status codes based on
what it finds and that is well supported with frequent signature
updates.</p><p>The system can be set up on an existing Linux firewall or a
separate machine, if you do not already have a Linux firewall in
place. If you choose to set up a separate machine as the e-mail
firewall, it doesn't have to be very powerful. A 200MHz 586 with
32MB of RAM would be plenty. Our network is attached to the
Internet via SDSL and is protected by a Mandrake Linux machine
running IP masquerade. This design made it easy to set up the
system on our current firewall machine. The internal e-mail system
used is not important as long as it speaks SMTP or ESMTP. In our
case, we use Novell's Groupwise product. All SMTP traffic (port 25)
should be redirected from the SMTP port on the firewall to the
machine you have set up as your e-mail firewall on the inside (or
to the firewall itself in our case). Now let's move on to the
actual setup.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4882f1.large.jpg"><img src="4882f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. Setup of Network Traffic and
Firewall</p></div></div>
</p><p>Our first step is to set up the filesystem hierarchy. A
diagram of this can be found in Figure 2. We will set up our system
in a directory named /var/spool/smtpd. If you have an average
e-mail volume of over 25,000 e-mails a day, I suggest partitioning
a separate hard drive dedicated to the e-mail firewall and mounting
it in this directory. The base directory will be /var/spool/smtpd.
In this directory we will make five subdirectories named incoming,
outgoing, etc, bin and quarantine. To start, become root and issue
this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
mkdir -p /var/spool/smtpd/ {etc,bin,incoming,outgoing,quarantine}
</pre><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="4882f2.large.jpg"><img src="4882f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 2. Filesystem Hierarchy</p></div></div>
</p><p>Next, change the permissions on the whole hierarchy to be
accessible only by the uucp user, since all the programs will be
run as this user. These commands will do the trick:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chown -R uucp.uucp /var/spool/smtpd
chmod -R 700 /var/spool/smtpd
</pre><p>Now we will set up the first component of the system. You
will need to grab the smtpd package from the Obtuse Systems' web
site mentioned earlier. Switch to the download directory and unpack
the tarball by issuing the command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
tar -zxvf smtpd-2.0.tar.gz
</pre>


Now change to the smtpd-2.0 directory and edit the Makefile to
reflect the following changes:
<pre     class="programlisting">
SPOOLDIR = /var/spool/smtpd
SPOOLSUBDIR = incoming
POLL_TIME = 300
PARANOID_SMTP = 1
JUNIPER_SUPPORT = 0
CHECK_IDENT = 0
</pre>


What we want is for smtpd to store mail in the incoming
subdirectory and smtpfwdd to read mail from the outgoing directory.
To make this possible we have to insert a line into the file
smtpfwdd.c. Insert the following two lines at line number 75:
<pre     class="programlisting">
// Pull mail from the outgoing subdir.
#define SPOOLSUBDIR "outgoing"
</pre>


Finish up by compiling and installing the package with these
commands:
<pre     class="programlisting">
make
make install
</pre>


Next, we need to populate the /var/spool/smtpd/etc directory with
some files to allow smtpd to operate correctly. Copy the
resolv.conf file from /etc to the /var/spool/smtpd/etc directory,
and then copy the file localtime from /etc to here. You also should
copy the antirelay_check_rules_example file from the smtpd-2.0
distribution directory to /var/spool/smtpd/etc and rename it
smtpd_check_rules. You can look on the Obtuse Systems' web site for
instructions on how to create check rules if you need this. I would
at least put in an antirelay rule to start. To have the smtpd
program start automatically, place an entry in your /etc/inetd.conf
file similar to this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
smtp    stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/sbin/smtpd    smptd
</pre>


This line should replace any other SMTP entries that may be there.
We will need to start smtpfwdd manually from /etc/rc.d/rc.local (or
whatever your local rc file is). So go ahead and add an entry like
this to your startup file:
<pre     class="programlisting">
### Start the smtpfwdd forwarding daemon
/usr/local/sbin/smtpfwdd
</pre>


Finally, you will need to shut down any other mail transfer agent
(MTA) that might be running. These would include Postfix, sendmail,
qmail and the like. On Red Hat systems you can do this simply by
running the setup utility, unchecking any MTAs from the system
services menu and rebooting. Be aware that some MTAs run as
children of other processes, such as Postfix, and simply can't be
killed directly. If you can reboot the machine, then go ahead and
do that now. If not, then you can issue these commands to get smtpd
and smtpfwdd up and running:
<pre     class="programlisting">
kill -HUP <span   class="emphasis"><em>inetdpid</em></span>
/usr/local/sbin/smtpfwdd
</pre>


where <span   class="emphasis"><em>inetdpid</em></span> is the Process ID for inetd.
</p><p>Once the smtpd and smtpfwdd d&aelig;mons are running, you can
test the setup by launching a Telnet session on port 25 (the smtp
port) of the e-mail firewall, like so:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
telnet <span   class="emphasis"><em>email.firewall.com</em></span> 25
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>email.firewall.com</em></span> is the hostname
of your e-mail firewall.
</p><p>You should get a prompt that says</p><pre     class="programlisting">
220 email.firewall.com SMTP ready,
Who are you gonna pretend to be today?
</pre><p>If you get any other prompt, then you probably forgot to shut
down a running MTA on the server. A <b  >ps -e</b> should
bear this out.
</p><p>Let's look at what we have so far. At this point you should
have a machine with the smtpd d&aelig;mon running and accepting
e-mail. All received e-mail is being stored in the
/var/spool/smtpd/incoming directory as simple ASCII text files. To
test this out, try issuing these commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
telnet email.firewall.com 25
helo firewall.com
mail from: joe@firewall.com
rcpt to:
data
This is a test.
.
quit
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>you@domain.com</em></span> is your e-mail
address. Be sure to end your message body with a period on a line
all by itself. This tells the server you are through sending text.
</p><p>If all went well, you should now see a text file in the
/var/spool/smtpd/incoming directory containing the contents of our
SMTP session. Now move the file into the /var/spool/smtpd/outgoing
directory. In a few minutes the file should disappear, and you
should receive the e-mail in your main mailbox.
<span   class="bold"><b>smtpd</b></span> saves e-mails as text files
named smtpd<span   class="emphasis"><em>??????</em></span>, where
<span   class="emphasis"><em>??????</em></span> is a randomly generated message ID.
<span   class="bold"><b>smtpfwdd</b></span> reads these text files
and forwards them to the destination server. After a file is
successfully forwarded, it is deleted.</p><p>So how does the mail get from incoming to outgoing? Here is
where our e-mail scanning script will come into play. The script
will search through each e-mail file in the incoming directory one
by one and look for viral content. If the file doesn't contain a
virus, it is moved to the outgoing directory. If it does, then it
gets moved to the quarantine directory. It's as simple as that. But
before the mail scanning script will work, we need to have a
functional piece of virus detection software installed. Let's focus
on that now.</p><p>What we need is a command-line based virus scanner. I chose
McAfee Virus Scan for UNIX/Linux, so that is what I describe here.
The McAfee product has a intuitive list of exit status codes, so it
is easy to integrate into shell scripts. You can get this product
by going to <a href="http://www.nai.com" target="_self">www.nai.com</a> and
using the e-store. After you install the product you will need to
make sure it is executable by uucp. To do this, go to the
/usr/local/uvscan directory and execute this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
chmod -R 755 *
</pre><p>Now test it out and make sure it works. Become uucp and issue
this command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/uvscan/uvscan --version
</pre>


If the test is successful, then we can move on to updating the
virus signature files. The signature files (or definition files as
they are sometimes called) are the lifeblood of any virus scanner.
Therefore, we will want to automate the process of updating them on
a frequent basis. It is important to check for these updates at
least biweekly, since new versions usually are put out at least
three times a month. To do this we must first create a Bash script
called sigupdate and place it in the /var/spool/smtpd/bin
directory. As always, make sure the script is owned and executable
by the uucp user. The contents of the script are shown in Listing 1
and should be easy to follow. The sigupdate file should be set to
run once a week, preferably at a low-volume time of day. We will do
this later by inserting a crontab entry for it. You also will need
to create a file in the uucp user's home directory called .netrc.
Edit this file to look as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
machine ftp.nai.com
login anonymous
password admin@domain.com
macdef init
cd pub/antivirus/datfiles/4.x
bin
prompt
mget dat-*.tar
close
bye
</pre>


<a href="4882l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1. sigupdate Script</a>
</p><p>The .netrc file controls sessions for predefined FTP hosts.
This is the best way to make our FTP session automatic. You can
reference the FTP man page for help with the netrc syntax. Go ahead
and run sigupdate as soon as it, and .netrc, are ready. After the
update finishes, execute this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/usr/local/uvscan/uvscan --version
</pre><p>Look at the virus data file creation date; it should be
recent, usually no more than a month old. If it is not, you will
need to check that sigupdate is running properly from the command
line.
</p><p>Now let's move on to the main mail scanning script. We will
name it scanmail, and it will be stored in the /var/spool/smtpd/bin
directory. This script will do all of the direct manipulation of
the e-mail text files created by smtpd. Create the file and make it
owned and executable by uucp. You will find the complete script in
Listing 2 [available at
<a href="../listings/092/4882.tgz" target="_self">ftp.linuxjournal.com/pub/lj/listings/issue92/4882.tgz</a>].
It is heavily commented so I will just give you an overview
here.</p><p>Starting on line 19, scanmail first switches to the incoming
directory and stores the e-mail filenames in an array variable. It
then loops through each filename and uses grep to search for
specific patterns within the files. Two passes are made through
each e-mail. The first pass greps for attachments that are
obviously bad. The patterns for this pass are stored in a file
named matches.bad, which we will create later. If grep hits a
match, that file is quarantined and an e-mail is sent to the
administrator containing a timestamp, the name of the file, who it
came from and who was to receive it.</p><p>If no match was made, a second pass is made on the e-mail.
This time grep uses a file named matches.doc to search for
attachments that could contain macro viruses or embedded viruses.
If a match is made this time, the attachment is decoded into a
dynamically generated temporary directory using the metamail
program. The temporary directory is created by using the name of
the e-mail with a &ldquo;_d&rdquo; concatenated onto the end. The contents of
the temp directory are then scanned with our command-line virus
scanner. If a virus is detected here (by checking the exit status
of the scanner), scanmail quarantines the e-mail and the
attachment(s) and sends the administrator an e-mail alert. A
courteous e-mail also is sent to the sender saying that they may
need to check their system for viruses and giving the name of the
virus detected.</p><p>At this point, if no viruses have been found, the e-mail is
moved over to the outgoing directory where it is delivered to the
internal e-mail server by smtpfwdd.
<span   class="bold"><b>smtpfwdd</b></span> scans the outgoing
directory for mail to deliver every five minutes.</p><p>The next thing to do is set up our filename lists that
scanmail will use to search for suspicious attachments.
<span   class="bold"><b>scanmail</b></span> uses the grep tool to
search through files. We will take advantage of the -f switch to
make grep pull a list of patterns from a specific text file. The
layout of the text file is simple, only one pattern per line.
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> will then match any pattern
listed in the file. Switch to the /var/spool/smtpd/etc directory
and create two files called matches.bad and matches.doc. In the
matches.bad file we list all the filename patterns that we
definitely don't want to come into our network without being
inspected by the administrator.</p><p>The matches.doc file, on the other hand, should contain
filename patterns for documents that may contain embedded viruses,
such as Word documents or spreadsheets. When creating these files,
use the form <b  >filename=.*\.exe</b> for each line.
This is so you will not get false alarms because of random strings
in the mime encoding that happen to match what grep is scouting.
Also, be sure not to have any blank lines in the file because grep
will interpret a blank line as a pattern to be searched for and
will match all e-mails. Vim is a good editor to use for creating
these files since you easily can see any blank lines. You can find
the contents of the files I use in Listing 3.</p><p><a href="4882l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3. grep Pattern
Files</a></p><p>The other script we will use is called daysumm and resides in
/var/spool/smtpd/bin. Create this file as shown in Listing 4.
<span   class="bold"><b>daysumm</b></span> sends a report of the
day's e-mail activity to the administrator. It shows how many
e-mails were received that day, how many viruses were detected and
which viruses they were. This file should be set up in cron to run
at 11:59 <b  >P.M.</b> each evening. The daysumm script
relies on the virus.$date and email.$date files in
/var/spool/smtpd/etc. These are text files that are created
dynamically, updated by scanmail and are date-dependent. For this
reason, daysumm must be run before midnight or the timestamp will
change and the wrong files will be read.</p><p><a href="4882l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4. daysumm
Script</a></p><p>If you will notice, each time we send an e-mail from the
firewall itself, such as from a script, we follow it up with the
command <b  >sendmail -q</b>. The -q switch tells
sendmail to start up, check for any outgoing mail, send it and then
exit. It effectively flushes all local outbound sendmail queues.
This is necessary since there is no MTA running on the machine
anymore. The smtpd package is not an MTA but a store-and-forward
agent only. It can be thought of as a dedicated mail relay program.
Without this command, you would never get any mail that originated
on the e-mail firewall itself.</p><p>We should now automate the whole process via the cron
d&aelig;mon. We will do this by way of the uucp user's personal
crontab file. Make sure you are logged on as uucp and issue the
command <b  >crontab -e</b>. This will open up uucp's
cron table for editing. Make the following entries for the
scanmail, daysumm and sigupdate scripts:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
MAILTO=""
# Run the scanmail script every two minutes
*/2 * * * * /var/spool/smtpd/bin/scanmail
# Run the daysumm script every night at 11:59PM
59 23 * * * /var/spool/smtpd/bin/daysumm
# Run sigupdate every Thursday at 4:00PM
0 16 * * 4 /var/spool/smtpd/bin/sigupdate
</pre><p>You can adjust the runtimes as necessary to suit your needs.
The main consideration as to how often to run scanmail is your
average daily e-mail volume. If you have a daily volume of over
10,000, I would set the interval to every two minutes and set
smtpfwdd to run every five minutes. This is so you don't send huge
batches of e-mail to your internal server all at once. If you have
a volume of around 1,000 a day or less, then scanmail could be run
every ten minutes and smtpfwdd could scan every 20 minutes. Also,
don't leave out the <b  >MAILTO=""</b> entry at the top
of the crontab. This is so crond will not send the uucp user any
mail about completed cron jobs. E-mail every two minutes will add
up quickly, and uucp never checks its own mail.
</p><p>I also have a Samba share set up to allow me access to the
/var/spool/smtpd hierarchy from my Windows machine. This is helpful
to administrators that mainly use Windows. It keeps me from having
to open up an ssh session each time I need to check a virus warning
message. You can do that by adding an entry such as this to your
/etc/smb.conf file:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
[mail-gate]
   Comment = Email firewall directories
   Path = /var/spool/smtpd
   Valid users =
   Admin users =
   Browseable = No
   Read Only = No
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> is your Samba user name.
</p><p>The final step is to divert all incoming SMTP connections
from your firewall to your new scanning server. If your firewall
uses IP masquerade, this is an easy task. Simply execute the
command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
ipmasqadm portfw -a -P tcp -L <span   class="emphasis"><em>firewall</em></span> 25 -R <span   class="emphasis"><em>destination</em></span> 25
</pre><p>where <span   class="emphasis"><em>firewall</em></span> is the address of the
firewall and <span   class="emphasis"><em>destination</em></span> is the address of
your new scanning server.
</p><p>If you have decided to run the e-mail firewall directly on
your existing firewall, then you don't need to make any changes. If
you have another firewall product, you will need to read the
documentation to figure out how to do port redirection. It should
not be too much trouble, but you may need to contact the maker of
your product to find out. Be sure to put this redirection command
in your startup scripts so that they will persist through
rebooting.</p><p>If everything went well, you should now have an operational
e-mail-virus firewall. Try sending yourself some test messages from
a free web e-mail account to make sure everything is in working
order. I periodically send myself macro-virus infected documents to
make sure the system is still functioning correctly. I can think of
many ways to expand this basic system to do other things.
Especially promising is the daysumm script, which could be enhanced
greatly. I currently am working on a CGI script that will report
current statistics, such as average daily volume, in an intranet
page. That is only one of a hundred ways this system could help you
manage and safeguard your e-mail system with little or no impact on
the company budget. If anyone comes up with some cool ways to
expand the system, please let me know. I'd love to hear about
it.</p></div></div>
