    Rick gives his impressions of all things embedded andembeddable at August's mega-Linux event.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f9c450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Despite the somewhat subdued mood of this
year's big West Coast LinuxWorld, there was near-universal
agreement that one thing seemed to have grown stronger over the
past six to twelve months: embedded Linux. Although the event does
not particularly focus on the embedded market, a host of new
products, technologies and strategies catering to the needs of
embedded systems and smart device developers and manufacturers was
unveiled and showcased. Everywhere you turned, you ran across
companies embedding Linux inside PDAs, entertainment devices
(especially TV set-top boxes), automotive telematics systems, thin
clients, etc.
</p><p>In the past, embedded Linux products and technologies
accounted for roughly 10% of what was showcased at LinuxWorld. At
this show, the embedded Linux fraction seems to have increased to
around 15-20%, which is not surprising, given the strong growth in
developer interest in embedded Linux reported in recent months by
market analysts VDC, Evans Data Corporation, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Embedded
Systems Programming</em></span> magazine, LinuxDevices.com and
others.</p><p>For those unable to make it to the show, or whose attention
was elsewhere, here's my traditional walk on the embedded side of
LinuxWorld in which I offer a summary of all things embedded and
embeddable (in alphabetic order). My apologies in advance, to
anyone or anything I missed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f9c660"></a>Applied Data Systems</h2></div></div><p>Visitors to ADS' booth were treated to a dazzling array of
LCD-adorned StrongARM-based, single-board computers&mdash;truly a
hardware geek's paradise. ADS has created their own embedded Linux
implementations that are offered as an option with all of their
SBCs, but in addition ADS was showcasing three Java-enabled,
graphically oriented application environments: Insignia's Jeode VM
running on Lineo's Embedix, IBM's VisualAge Micro Edition running
on MontaVista's Hard Hat Linux and Blackdown's JDK running on ADS'
own flavor of embedded Linux. ADS also announced this week that
they have been selected by Intel as a third-party platform provider
for Intel's StrongARM and XScale processors and will be developing
a modified version of their Graphics Master SBC for use as a
reference platform by Intel customers. (See

booth, David Anders was showing off his company's tiny Linux
system&mdash;definitely a cool little Linux box. Anders said a new
version, which is coming out soon, adds a CompactFlash slot that
facilitates system expansion and the use of removable media. Nice
touch. (See

Red Hat's large pavilion. Century's big announcement at the show
was PIXIL, a respin and enhancement of its previous key products
(Microwindows and ViewML) into a new suite of graphical
environments, tools and applications targeting Linux-based PDAs,
webpads and thin-client devices. Demonstrations included PIXIL
running on a Compaq iPAQ PDA, as well as a PIXIL-based set-top box
based on National Semiconductor's SP1SC10 set-top box development
platform. Greg Haerr (Century's CEO) made the claim that, whereas
the TV Linux Alliance Project is just at the point of beginning to
define standards, Century/National's newly announced Linux4.TV is
available for immediate use by customers and already provides
support for both digital and analog TV, personal video recorder
(PVR) functions and APIs for both kernel and middleware software
interfacing. (See

technology that allows Linux systems to use Windows browsers and
application helpers. According to Jeremy White (president), an
embedded version of CrossOver is being developed that will occupy
on the order of 1MB of RAM and 4.5MB of storage. Unfortunately, the
Windows plugins are sometimes quite greedy in terms of the system
resources they require in order to run under CrossOver.
CodeWeavers, a driving force behind WINE, can provide services for
getting embedded applications to run on Linux under WINE or can
port the apps directly to Linux APIs. (See
<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com" target="_self">www.codeweavers.com</a>.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x1f9cd98"></a>Earthlink's R&amp;D Group</h2></div></div><p>This group showcased the prototype of an open-standards
Automotive Vehicle Location (AVL) telematics platform that was
created to serve as a platform to demonstrate automotive software
applications, study how Linux and internet technologies can be
applied to the automotive environment and test the feasibility and
effectiveness of systems such as remote diagnostics, m-commerce and
location-sensitive applications. Earthlink is sponsoring a contest
for Linux, XML, Java, wireless and web application developers. Come
up with a clever idea and get one of these interesting systems to
play with. (See

recently, including Future Sound Technologies, Intel Corporation,
American Megatrends, Inc., Aleph One, Ltd. and Vibren Technologies.
Based on the roster at the ELC web site, the consortium currently
has 68 corporate members (36 executive and 32 affiliate level). One
bit of hot news is that the ELC's Board of Directors recently
approved a change to the ELC's bylaws to allow the ELC to own
intellectual property, thereby clearing the way for ELC to engage
in developing and licensing embedded Linux standards. (See

announcement in connection with LinuxWorld. Per the announcement,
embedded Linux is now the OS of choice for all HP-developed
devices. HP's embedded Linux system is called Chai-LX. HP also
demonstrated the new Digital Entertainment Center audio system,
which contains an x86 processor and uses Chai-LX as its embedded
OS. (See

modified Ford Explorer 2002 Limited Edition that has been outfitted
with Linux-powered computers running a variety of web-enabled
applications. In the demo, a simple user interface on a
Bluetooth-enabled PDA controls the car's headlights, door locks and
engine starter. Other IBM technologies showcased in various
locations on the show floor with applicability to embedded
Linux-based systems included the DB2 database, VisualAge Micro
Edition (shown by MontaVista) and Embedded ViaVoice (also at
MontaVista's booth). (See

locations on the show floor due to having acquired several other
Embedded Linux companies, Lineo was not an exhibitor this time, but
instead held a press conference to make several strategic
announcements. These included: the selection of Lineo's Embedix
Digital Media core by Motorola for use in the DCT5000 set-top box
and the planned release of a &ldquo;GPL Compliance Toolset&rdquo; to help
developers and their companies identify which licenses govern their
software and what the implications of those licenses are. (See

Linux pre-installed, they'll probably refer you to Lisa Systems.
Lisa demonstrated their iPAQ/Linux combo, which makes use of
Trolltech's Qt/Embedded as its GUI framework, at a pedestal in
Compaq's large LinuxWorld pavilion. (See
<a href="http://www.lisa.de" target="_self">www.lisa.de</a>.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x23960c0"></a>LynuxWorks</h2></div></div><p>Like Lineo, LynuxWorks decided not to have their own booth at
LinuxWorld. They did, however, have a small presence at a pedestal
within Intel's pavilion, where they demonstrated their port of
BlueCat Linux to Intel's Internet Exchange Architecture (IXA). (See
<a href="http://www.lynuxworks.com" target="_self">www.lynuxworks.com</a>.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x2396220"></a>MontaVista</h2></div></div><p>Like a show within a show, MontaVista's large pavilion-style
booth was bristling with product and technology demonstrations.
Beneath a giant hard hat-adorned Tux suspended from the convention
hall ceiling, were:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A demo of Hard Hat Linux (HHL) 2.0's
cross-development tools targeting an Alchemy AU1000 system-on-chip
based set-top box reference platform. The use of the new KDevelop
IDE was also being shown, as were MontaVista's Target Configuration
Tool and newly GPLed Library Optimizer Tool.</p></li><li><p>A demo that dramatized the improvement in interrupt
latency that can be obtained using MontaVista's &ldquo;fully preemptable
kernel&rdquo; enhancement, in which streaming audio was being played in
a system that was under a heavy load (repeated disk saves).
Interrupt latencies were captured and graphed for visual
comparison.</p></li><li><p>A demo of MontaVista's newly announced High
Availability Framework, in which a CompactPCI-based Linux system
was shown to maintain a video display reliably from a network-based
streaming video source while one or more of three Ethernet cables
were disconnected.</p></li><li><p>A set-top box demo based on HHL and the recently
announced Hard Hat Graphics running on IBM's &ldquo;Redwood&rdquo; PowerPC
405-based reference platform.</p></li><li><p>HHL running on an iPAQ PDA, using two
approaches&mdash;Hard Hat Graphics and Trolltech's
Qt/Embedded&mdash;including demonstrations of both tools' GUI-builder
development methods.</p></li><li><p>Demos of two IBM products: VisualAge Micro Edition,
a Java-like VM; and ViaVoice, speech recognition software that
supports both desktop and embedded systems. ViaVoice-based
speaker-independent command and control supposedly can fit within
200KB of RAM.</p></li><li><p>A delightful demonstration of embedded Linux-based
machine control, in which Intrinsyc's tiny StrongARM-based
CerfBoard SBC running HHL was shown controlling the walking of a
Lego MindStorm Robot that looked like something out of a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Star Wars</em></span> movie. (See

reference platform and Tynux Linux OS. They also had a
Korean-manufactured cell phone/PDA on display. (See

version of a new Red Hat Embedded Linux Developer Kit. The tool is
meant to make it easy for developers to embed Red Hat Linux.
According to deBlaquiere, the tool makes use of standard Red Hat
SRPMS, so it &ldquo;leverages the stability of Red Hat Linux
transitioned to the embedded space&rdquo;. A number of predefined
baseline configurations are available, including minimum bootable
system, minimum networked system, etc., to which developers can add
whatever they require by means of an easy-to-use, GUI-based
configurator. One unique aspect to Red Hat's target OS builder
approach, according to deBlaquiere, is that unlike Lineo's LIPO and
MontaVista's LOT, Red Hat's library reduction/optimization process
makes use of the four defined EL/IX profiles, with the result that
embedded systems will be characterizable as being compliant with a
specific well-defined API set. Additionally, Red Hat's RedBoot
debugger/boot loader has been integrated into the new Embedded
Linux kit as a standard component. deBlaquiere said the first beta
release of the new kit is expected within a few weeks. Speaking of
which, both RedBoot and Red Hat's other OS, eCOS, were also being
demonstrated in Red Hat's pavilion. (See
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/embedded" target="_self">www.redhat.com/embedded</a>.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1ea4580.0x2396d78"></a>REDSonic</h2></div></div><p>REDSonic demonstrated four new products, including: Secure
SOHO, a gateway/firewall software solution; Windows-Based Terminal,
software that provides thin-client, Linux-based access to Windows
applications and services; LinuxBIOS, a ROM-based Linux kernel that
replaces legacy BIOS code for secure, fast boot; and a REDSonic
PowerPC starter kit for the MPC 823. REDSonic also showcased an
interesting customer application: SignSite, manufactured by Clarity
Visual Systems. It is a bright, full-color &ldquo;digital billboard&rdquo;
that is used for advertising and information display in public
places. The device contains an embedded Ampro Encore 500
Pentium-based SBC running REDSonic's REDICE-Linux OS. (See

camera reference platform based on the TI TMS320DSC21 dual-core
(RISC + DSP) system-on-chip processor. That chip, according to Rudy
Prince (RidgeRun CEO), is used in several high-end digital cameras
from HP and Kodak. Also demonstrated was the DSPLinux development
environment's very slick &ldquo;appliance simulator&rdquo;. Can we expect to
find DSPLinux inside digital cameras sometime soon? &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;,
replied Prince. Embedded Linux will play a growing role in devices
that feature Ethernet, 802.11 or Bluetooth connectivity and other
high-end functions, according to Prince. (See

new set-top box reference platform and also on some very nice
looking thin-client systems. They also gave the first LinuxWorld
demonstration of their TASTE OS running on an iPAQ PDA. The iPAQ
demo included TUXIA's Nanozilla small footprint browser with 802.11
wireless web connectivity. The company issued two key news
announcements in conjunction with the show: an agreement with
system-on-chip maker Rise to support Rise's SOCs with TASTE
Embedded Linux and the selection of TASTE as the Embedded Linux OS
