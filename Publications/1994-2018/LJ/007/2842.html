deal on the ez editor and on the multi-media user mail agent,
messages, but these are only two of a rich set of applications.
Here are a few other applications that you'll find useful:
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>bush</b></span> (see Figure 1) provides
a graphical interface to the file system. It shows the directory
hierarchy, filenames and their attributes. It also provides a
window where the ez editor will run as well as a means to invoke an
arbitrary command on a file. With <span   class="emphasis"><em>bush</em></span> you can
sort the list, rename, and delete files, too.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2842f1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Bush Showing a Tree of Directories
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>chart</b></span> allows you to create
simple graphs from numeric data. The data can be presented as a
histogram, pie chart, or line graph.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>ezdiff</b></span> is not actually an
application, but rather a procedure you can call from all
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ez</em></span> windows. This is used to run the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>diff</em></span> command on the data in two windows and
then interactively see the difference between the files.</p><p>To try <span   class="emphasis"><em>ezdiff</em></span>, edit two files (e.g.,
<b  >ez/etc/hosts .deny/etc/hosts.equiv</b>). In each
window, select the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Start</em></span> item on the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Ezdiff</em></span> menu card. As you select the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Next</em></span> item on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Ezdiff</em></span>
menu card, the differences in each file are shown as highlighted
data. This makes it very easy to copy lines selected in one window
and paste them in the other. And yes, <span   class="emphasis"><em>ez</em></span>
correctly remembers the locations of all the other differences when
you make changes to either document. This is a life saver when
looking at various versions of a file.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>figure</b></span> (see Figure 2) is a
fairly conventional drawing editor. The files usually have an
extension of <b  >.fi</b>. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Figure</em></span>
can create a document with lines, circles, boxes, and other insets
(e.g., rasters or text), and then move them around, reshape, etc.
Since <span   class="emphasis"><em>figure</em></span> creates an ATK data-stream, you
can easily insert figures in other AUIS documents.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2842f2.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. Sample AUIS Figure
</p></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>pipescript</b></span> (see Figure 3)
reads data from stdin and displays it in a window. This is very
convenient with pipes, because the output data does not disturb
your <span   class="emphasis"><em>xterm</em></span> window and yet is not in a file you
need to remove. The data can be conveniently scrolled, searched or
saved. I use it all the time for commands like <b  >tar tzvf
auis63L1-wp.tgz | pipescript</b>.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>raster</b></span> provides a simple
means to edit digitized pictures (called rasters). The data must be
in AUIS data-stream format. The
<span   class="bold"><b>pbmplus</b></span> package (available on
sunsite) provides a wide set of filters to convert between various
forms of digitized data. For example, to convert from a TIFF to an
AUIS-raster, I'd use this command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
tifftopnm test.tif | ppmquant 256 | ppmtopgm\
| pgmtopbm | pbmtocmuwm &gt; test.ras
</pre><p><span   class="bold"><b>typescript</b></span> (see Figure 4)
provides an alternative to <span   class="emphasis"><em>xterm</em></span>. You enter
commands to your shell in the input window and the results are
shown in the same window where they can be scrolled, searched or
saved. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Typescript</em></span> does not support curses like
xterm does, so you cannot run vi or bash in a typescript, for
example. However, you can use the tcsh or pdksh (ksh)
shells.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2842f3.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. grep InitializeClass *.c | pipescript
</p></div></div><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Typescript</em></span> has several other features
that I find very useful. The <b  >README</b> for the word
processing package describes how you can cause the current working
directory to be kept in the title of the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>typescript</em></span> window.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Typescript</em></span> is &ldquo;smart&rdquo; about these paths, too.
Notice in Figure 4 that the path shown in the title of the window
is &ldquo;~&rdquo;, my home directory, and not a fully qualified path.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Typescript</em></span> supports the use of several
PC keys to make it easier to enter commands. The Cursor-Left and
Cursor-Right keys can be used to edit the current command
(regardless of whether my shell supports this). The Home and End
keys will move the cursor to the beginning or end of the line (or
selected area). The cursor keys are also mapped to allow me to move
up and down through the command history. Cursor-Up gets the
previous command entered, Cursor-Down the next.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="2842f4.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Sample Typescript Window
</p></div></div><p>In my opinion an even more useful feature is command
completion. If I type <b  >ls</b> and then press
Cursor-Up, I get the previous command that began with &ldquo;ls&rdquo;. File
completion is supported with the tab key. If I enter <b  >ls
src/tp</b> and then press the tab key,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>typescript</em></span> will complete the path &ldquo;src/tp&rdquo; to
&ldquo;src/tpg-config&rdquo; (in my case). It makes entering paths to files ten
times easier. I love it!</p><p>If I enter a command like <b  >ls /etc</b>, the
window will likely fill and scroll automatically. If I want to see
the beginning of the scrolled data, I must use the mouse (or
Page-Up/Down keys) to scroll. However, if I enter <b  >ls /etc
control-J</b> (where I enter the command with a control-J
keystroke, rather than the normal Enter), the command is executed,
but the output is pushed to the top of the current window so I do
not need to scroll.</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Typescript</em></span> also allows me to create my
own menus in the file <b  >~/.shmenu</b>. In Figure 4,
you can see I have a menu card <span   class="emphasis"><em>Internet</em></span> on the
menubar. This is from my own <b  >.shmenu</b> file which
looks like this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
#  User's .shmenu file
#       Do help .shmenu for more information.
#       Establish the pop up menus for the
# typescript window.

modify a selected area. The <span   class="emphasis"><em>Misc</em></span> menu card
provides items to fold data to lower case, upper case or to &ldquo;flow&rdquo;
the data together. To use filters, simply select an area (so it is
highlighted) and select the correct item. There is also an item
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>Filter Prompt</em></span>) which allows you to specify
your own filter. For instance, specifying the filter sort would
cause the selected text to be sorted&mdash;just like you would in a
conventional Unix pipe.</p><p><a href="2842s1.html" target="_self">Introduction to AUIS</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d8580.0x27c8a70"></a>Personalizing AUIS</h2></div></div><p>You can tailor the behavior and appearance of your AUIS
applications with your own <b  >~/preferences</b> file.
Each time an application begins, it checks a set of resources you
have specified in your <b  >preferences</b> file. The
resources in the <b  >preferences</b> file are similar to
other X-resources. A sample <b  >preferences</b> file is
provided in <b  >/usr/andrew/sample.preference</b>. If
you edit this file you will find lines like these:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
Messages.Geometry: 750x600
Figure.BackgroundColor: White
*.BackgroundColor: LightSkyBlue4
</pre><p>The first field (e.g., Messages, Figure or &ldquo;*&rdquo;) is the
application name. The asterisk means it applies to all AUIS
applications. AUIS resource names are case insensitive, so
&ldquo;Messages&rdquo; is the same as &ldquo;messages&rdquo;. The second field is specific
to the application. Most of these, like &ldquo;Geometry&rdquo; or
&ldquo;BackgroundColor&rdquo;, will be pretty obvious. Others, like
&ldquo;XStyleSelections&rdquo;, will be a mystery unless you read the
preferences help file (<b  >auishelp preferences</b>).
Some of these resources are specific to a single application and
others apply to all AUIS applications.</p><p>The third field (after the colon) is the value of the
resource and is tied directly to the second field. These resources
can be rather confusing. To make it easier to understand what
resources can be set for which applications, a specialized
preferences editor was written,
<span   class="bold"><b>prefed</b></span>. As you can see in Figure
5, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>prefed</em></span> window is divided into four
areas. You select the application name in the upper left hand
window (&ldquo;EZ&rdquo; in this case). The upper right hand window has the
list of resource names (&ldquo;OverwriteFiles&rdquo;). The middle window shows
you what the current setting is and allows you to change it.
Finally, the bottom window provides a description of what the
resource controls. When you select the item
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Save</em></span>, your <b  >preferences</b> file
will be modified, just as you would expect with any editor. The
addition of <span   class="emphasis"><em>prefed</em></span> has made it much easier to
figure out this bewildering array of resource names. When an
application initializes, it searches for all resources that apply
to that application. The resources are applied in the order that
they are read. The search order is first in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>~/preferences</em></span> and then in the machine-wide
&ldquo;preferences&rdquo; file in
<b  >/usr/andrew/lib/global.prf</b>. Thus, if you specify
any resources that apply against all applications (e.g.,
*.BackgroundColor), these should be at the bottom of your
preferences file. This is sightly different than resources for
conventional X-applications.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that
<span   class="emphasis"><em>preferences</em></span> are only read when an application
initializes. If you change the <span   class="emphasis"><em>ez</em></span>
BackgroundColor, for example, this will not take effect until you
start a new <span   class="emphasis"><em>ez</em></span> from the command line (from an
<span   class="emphasis"><em>xterm</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>typescript</em></span>).</p><p><span   class="emphasis"><em>Messages</em></span>, the multi-media mail user
agent, is unique with respect to its treatment of preferences.
Since there are a great many preferences resources for messages, a
long time ago the author of messages added his own specialized way
to set preferences for messages by selecting the Set Options item
on the Other menu card.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d8580.0x27c93b8"></a>Printing</h2></div></div><p>Printing is an area where it seems everyone needs to &ldquo;have
their own way&rdquo;. AUIS printing involves two steps. Applications
generate <span   class="emphasis"><em>groff</em></span> data and the first step is to
format this to generate the printer-specific datastream. The second
step is to simply deliver the stream to the printer. These two
steps can be overridden with your <span   class="emphasis"><em>preferences</em></span>.
The default preferences settings are:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*.FormatCommand: /usr/andrew/etc/atkprint /tmp/%s.n |
*.PrintCommand:  lpr -P$PRINTER
</pre><p>These two commands are joined in a pipeline (hence the pipe
character, &ldquo;|&rdquo;, at the end of <span   class="emphasis"><em>FormatCommand</em></span>).
When this command is built, the <b  >%s</b> will be
changed to the name of the <span   class="emphasis"><em>groff</em></span> input
file.</p><p>Many AUIS applications actually generate PostScript data with
just a simple <span   class="emphasis"><em>groff</em></span> &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; around the
PostScript. In the next major release, AUIS will generate
PostScript directly and the need for a FormatCommand will be
eliminated. But for now, if you are having difficulty you might
want to copy <b  >/usr/andrew/etc/atkprint</b> and make
your own version which you can modify to meet your needs. You can
then specify your own <span   class="emphasis"><em>FormatCommand</em></span> resource
to invoke your own version of atkprint.</p><p>Sometimes I want to capture the groff input, so I simply make
a quick <span   class="emphasis"><em>preferences</em></span> change</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*.FormatCommand: cat /tmp/%s.n &gt; /tmp/test.n
</pre><p>to copy in the input file to <b  >/tmp/test.n</b>.
   I can then execute the print sequence manually with:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
/tmp/atkprint /tmp/test.n | pipescript
</pre><p>so I can see exactly what's happening in the shell script. On the
other end, if I want to simply capture the PostScript, I can change
<span   class="emphasis"><em>preferences</em></span> to:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
*.PrintCommand:  cat &gt; /tmp/test.ps
</pre><p>There are obviously many ways to accomplish either of these steps.
The point to remember is that AUIS printing is entirely
externalized. You can control it to any degree you need.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d8580.0x27c9bf8"></a>Initialization Files</h2></div></div><p>At startup AUIS applications look for several initialization
files. There are two classes of these, global or machine-wide files
found in <b  >/usr/andrew/lib</b> and personal files,
found in your home directory. Each application can have its own
initialization file. For example, ez would check for files in this
order:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
~/.ezinit
/usr/andrew/lib/global.ezinit
~/.atkinit
/usr/andrew/lib/global.atkinit
</pre><p>If the <b  >.ezinit</b> file is found, the
<b  >global.ezinit</b> is not read. Similarly, if
<b  >.atkinit</b> is found, the
<b  >global.atkinit</b> file is not read. This ordering
means that when you create an initialization file, you should make
it refer to the files that it masks by using an &ldquo;include&rdquo;
statement. So, if you are going to make a
<b  >.ezinit</b> file, you would want to include the
<b  >global.ezinit</b> by:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
include /usr/andrew/lib/global.ezinit
include $HOME/.atkinit
</pre><p>and your <b  >~/.atkinit</b> should probably
include <b  >/usr/andrew/lib/global.atkinit</b>.
</p><p>If you don't include the global file, you will not get
important default settings. Note, though, that not all programs
have global initialization files. When something is defined more
than once, the last definition stays in effect.</p><p>While I used <span   class="emphasis"><em>ez</em></span> in this example, this
works exactly the same for <span   class="emphasis"><em>typescript</em></span> or any
other AUIS application. <span   class="emphasis"><em>Typescript</em></span> would read
<b  >~/.typescriptinit</b>, or if that file did not
exist, it would read
<b  >/usr/andrew/lib/global.typescriptinit</b> instead.
All applications look for <b  >~/.atkinit and
/usr/andrew/lib/global.atkinit</b>. These files are described
in more detail with the command auishelp initfiles.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d8580.0x27ca438"></a>Controlling Menus</h2></div></div><p>In AUIS applications menus are simply a means to call a
procedure (method) for an object. AUIS has hundreds of these
defined and they provide enormous functionality. To define a menu,
edit one of the initialization files described previously (a
personal initialization file is probably best) and add lines like
these:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
addmenu filter-filter-region-thru-command
"Misc,Flow~20"  textview \
        filter inherit "flowtogether"
addmenu textview-lowercase-word         "Misc,Lower~21"
textview
addmenu textview-uppercase-word         "Misc,Upper~22"
textview
addmenu filter-filter-region            "Misc,Filter
Prompt~25" textview
</pre><p>The entries shown add items like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Flow</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Lower</em></span> to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Misc</em></span>
menu card. The order of these items is determined by the numbers
(20, 21, etc.). When you select a item like
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Lower</em></span>, the procedure
<span   class="emphasis"><em>textview-lowercase-word</em></span> will be called and the
selected area will be folded to lower case.</p><p>Knowing the procedure names is important to create menu
cards. There is no fixed list of all the procedures that are in
AUIS because the AUIS objects are dynamically loaded. To help you
find out what is available, select <span   class="emphasis"><em>Describe Proc
Table</em></span> on the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Misc</em></span> menu card. This
will open a window which displays a list of all the procedures and
a short description of purpose for each.</p><p>A more complex example is shown when the procedure
<span   class="emphasis"><em>filter-filter-region-thru-command</em></span> is called
when the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Flow</em></span> item is selected. In this case
the procedure calls the filter <span   class="emphasis"><em>flowtogether</em></span>.
Flowtogether is a simple filter which combines lines together to
remove excess whitespace and create data in paragraphs. I use this
filter in messages when I want to quote part of some mail and make
it nicer looking.</p><p>Most of the menus you see in the Linux distribution were
added using addmenu in the various initialization files. You can
add your own menu cards by adding addmenu commands in your private
initialization files. More details on adding menu cards can be
found with the command <b  >auishelp
initfiles</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d8580.0x2ade060"></a>Filetypes</h2></div></div><p>If I issue the command <b  >ez test.d</b>, the data
in this file will be an AUIS text document, but if I edit the file
<b  >test.document</b>, it will be just simply ASCII
data. The difference obviously has something to do with the
extension of the file. Linux, like all conventional Unix systems,
really has no innate &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; of what is in a file, but we all
have expectations for what's in the file <b  >test.c</b>.
It's just a matter of convention. AUIS has its own conventions and
these are controlled in the file
<b  >/usr/andrew/lib/global.filetypes</b> which has
entries like these:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
addfiletype .Xdefaults     rawtext   "template=rawtext"
addfiletype .c          ctext     "template=c"
addfiletype .h          ctext     "template=h"
addfiletype .d          text      "template=default"
addfiletype .doc        text      "template=default"
addfiletype .help       text      "template=help"
</pre><p>Addfiletype commands allow you to map extensions to inset
types so that new documents you create with a certain extension
will get the proper inset type specified by the &ldquo;template=&rdquo;
keyword.</p><p>Editing <b  >.Xdefaults</b> will have the template
<span   class="bold"><b>rawtext</b></span> (which will insure that
copying an AUIS datastream results in a simple ASCII string and not
some bold text) and editing <b  >.Xdefaults.old</b>
results in the <span   class="bold"><b>default</b></span> template
(which allows you to copy and retain
<span   class="bold"><b>bold</b></span> text) which is probably not
what you want. The current AUIS distribution does not allow you to
use wildcards in addfiletype commands, so you must explicitly map
.Xdefaults and <b  >.Xdefaults.old</b> individually. More
details on filetypes can be found with the command
<b  >auishelp initfiles</b>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d8580.0x2ade638"></a>Key Definitions</h2></div></div><p>In AUIS applications, keystroke combinations are another
means to get a procedure called for an object. The same procedures
are available for keybinding as for menu items. To define a set of
keybindings, edit one of the initialization files described
previously and add lines like these:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
addkey compile-build          ^X^E srctextview compile
addkey compile-next-error     ^X^N srctextview compile
addkey compile-previous-error ^X^P srctextview compile
addkey fcomp-complete-command-forward \eB typescript fcomp inherit
addkey fcomp-complete-filename ^I typescript
addkey fcomp-possible-completions \e^I typescript
</pre><p>The first line of the example says that when you are in a
srctextview inset (e.g., editing C-source), the procedure name
compile-build will be called when you press the keystrokes
&lt;control&gt;X followed by &lt;control&gt;E. (The
<b  >\eB</b> in the fourth line means you should press
the escape key and then &lt;shift&gt;b.) You can see a dynamically
created list of all the keys that are bound to a procedure by
selecting the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Describe Bound Keys</em></span> item on the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Misc</em></span> menu card. You can also query what
procedure will be called for any keystroke by selecting the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Describe Key</em></span> item on the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Misc</em></span> menu card.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x26d8580.0x2ade9a8"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>AUIS is far more than just <span   class="emphasis"><em>ez</em></span> or
<span   class="emphasis"><em>messages</em></span>--and yet in many ways it is no more.
AUIS is built on a toolkit of objects which combine to provide a
set of tools which are consistent in their look and feel and which
can be extended or combined with new applications with remarkable
ease. In these four articles on AUIS I have not attempted to show
any of the underlying toolkit. The Andrew Consortium is dedicated
to extending and disseminating this technology. If you think your
organization could benefit, I'd encourage you to contact the
consortium and talk with us about what else has been done and
what's new.</p></div></div>
