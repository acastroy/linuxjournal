        <span   class="emphasis"><em>Recompiling your Linux kernel might not be as scary as you think. Clarence Smith gives us a good step-by-step process for building your own customized kernel.</em></span>
      </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e2580.0x12da348"></a></h2></div></div><p>Have you ever wondered why in the blazes
someone would want to <span   class="emphasis"><em>recompile</em></span> a Linux system
kernel? For some, that is a challenging question. Many new users to
Linux are under the impression that when they install Linux, the
installation itself is perfect. Don't assume that Linux is set up
efficiently for your exact setup out of the box. Here's why (and
how) to change it.
</p><p>Let's say you have bought a new laptop, and you want to run
Linux on it. You've got only 4MB of RAM, and you've got only 100MB
of hard drive space. A finely tuned Linux kernel is key to having
all possible memory space available on your system, and thus is the
key to having a faster system for a small-time investment.</p><p>You are probably aware that Linux provides &ldquo;virtual memory&rdquo;
(also known as swap space or paging space) that allows programs to
use more memory than is really on the system by temporarily moving
the contents of some of that memory to disk. You may not be aware,
however, that no parts of the kernel can be paged out to disk.
Every byte taken up by the kernel is a byte that can't be used by
<span   class="emphasis"><em>anything</em></span> else.</p><p>If the kernel you are running has SCSI support, networking,
and sound all compiled in, but you don't have or use SCSI,
networking, or a sound card, you are wasting memory. This is
probably the case if your kernel came with your Linux distribution,
because those kernels are generally compiled to work with a very
wide selection of devices, and are not tuned to your
hardware.</p><p>If you only have 4MB of memory, you are also likely wasting a
lot of time as other programs get swapped out to disk and then back
into memory. By compiling a new kernel without the unnecessary
pieces, you can make your Linux computer run a lot faster.</p><p>Fortunately, Linux makes this easy.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e2580.0x12da6b8"></a>Think First</h2></div></div><p>First of all, you need to consider the hardware you have.
What types of peripherals do you have? What type of mouse do you
have? Do you have a sound card?</p><p>To build and compile the best kernel for your system, you
must be aware of your hardware make-up. You may find it helpful to
sit down and list all the parts of your computer. Not only will
this help you now, but it will also help you post good problem
reports if you encounter a problem or bug, since you need the same
information about your configuration when posting problem
reports.</p><p>To configure your system, you first need to have the Linux
source code installed on your system. This is available via
<b  >ftp</b> from <b  >nic.funet.fi</b> in
<b  >/pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus</b>,
<b  >tsx-11.mit.edu</b> in the directory
<b  >/pub/linux/sources/system</b>, or
<b  >sunsite.unc.edu</b> in
<b  >/pub/Linux/kernel</b>, or other mirrors around the
world. The directory name will depend on the kernel version: Linux
versions 1.1.x are kept in the <b  >v1.1</b> directory,
and have names like <b  >linux-1.1.45.tar.gz</b>, with
patch named like <b  >patch46.gz</b>. You only need to
get patches with numbers later than the version of the tar file you
get.</p><p>Alternately, if you bought Linux from someone, they are
required by Linux's GPL copyright to have provided the source, or
to provide it (possibly for a nominal fee) upon request.</p><p>The source code should be unpacked into
<b  >/usr/src/linux</b>, because it expects to be there.
See the sidebar <a  href="#unpack">&ldquo;Unpacking the Linux
Source&rdquo;</a> if you do not know how to do this.</p><p>After unpacking the source, you should apply any
<span   class="bold"><b>kernel patches</b></span> that are needed to
get the version you want. You should insert your patches (while
they are still compressed, or gzipped) into
<b  >/usr/src/linux</b>. Then from
<b  >/usr/src/linux</b>, type:</p><p><b  >gunzip -c patch?.gz | patch -s -p1gunzip -c
patch??.gz | patch -s -p1</b></p><p>The <b  >?</b> gets patches 1-9
<span   class="bold"><b>in order</b></span>, and should be done only
if you are using one of those patches. The <b  >??</b>
will get all patches (that exist, and that you have downloaded)
between 10 and 99 <span   class="bold"><b>in order</b></span>. It is
important that all the patches be applied <span   class="bold"><b>in
order</b></span>. The <b  >-s</b> argument to
<b  >patch</b> tells <b  >patch</b> to work
silently, and only complain about errors. The
<b  >-p1</b> tells <b  >patch</b> that we are
in the <b  >/usr/src/linux</b> directory, so that it
knows how to find files, and puts new files in the right place. The
<b  >-s</b> flag is optional; the <b  >-p1</b>
argument is mandatory.</p><p>Alternately, you can run each patch separately:</p><p><b  >gunzip -c patch8.gz | patch -p1gunzip -c patch9.gz |
patch -p1...gunzip -c patch46.gz | patch -p1</b></p><p>and so on.</p><p>Once you've completed the patches, you may want to remove any
unnecessary files created by the patches. These files are the
original versions of the files that are changed in any way, so they
can take up a substantial amount of space. You can find and remove
them by typing:</p><p><b  >find /usr/src/linux -name '*.orig' -o -name
'*~'-exec rm -f {} ;</b></p><p>You can look for any files that did not patch correctly, and
thus find out in advance that there has been a problem that will
likely make it impossible to compile your kernel, by typing:</p><p><b  >find /usr/src/linux -name '*.rej'
-print</b></p><p>That will list any files for which there were &ldquo;rejected
hunks&rdquo;; patches that could not be fitted into the source correctly.
If you find any of these files, start over. If you still see these
files, ask someone for help; there are too many things that could
be wrong to cover in this article.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e2580.0x12db7e8"></a>Configuring the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Now, from within <b  >/usr/src/linux</b>, type
<b  >make config</b>. You are now prompted to answer many
questions about your system. If you say you don't have hardware
that you do have, that particular hardware will not be supported by
the new kernel. Likewise, if you say you have hardware that you
don't have, you will waste memory. Also, you want to enable only
the software features that you are going to use.</p><p>I will attempt to point out some of the most significant
configuration questions. One of the first questions is:</p><p><b  >'Kernel math emulation' CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION
?</b></p><p>If you don't have a math co-processor, you should answer this
question YES. Those who do have a math co-processor chould answer
NO. A kernel with math-emulation compiled in it will still use the
processor if one is present. The math-emulation simply won't get
used in that instance. This will result however in a somewhat
larger kernel and a waste of memory.</p><p>There are a couple of questions about hard disk support. One
in particular can cause a bit of confusion:</p><p><b  >'XT harddisk support'
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_XD</b></p><p>I answer this question NO. This really doesn't have to do
with hard disks&mdash;it has to do with your
<span   class="bold"><b>controller card</b></span>.
<span   class="bold"><b>AT</b></span> controller cards are 16-bit
cards supported by the standard hard disk driver.
<span   class="bold"><b>XT</b></span> controller cards are 8-bit
cards that are <span   class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> rare in 386-class
machines.</p><p><b  >'TCP/IP networking' CONFIG_INET :</b></p><p>Answer YES if you plan to have your system interactive on the
net. This includes SLIP and PPP connections. Answer NO if you
aren't going to connect to the net right now; you can always
compile another kernel later.</p><p><b  >'System V IPC' CONFIG_SYSVIPC :</b></p><p>This isn't used for many things, but doesn't use much memory.
YES is recommended.</p><p><b  >'Use -m486 flag for 486-specific optimizations'
CONFIG_M486 :</b></p><p>If you have an i386 system, answer NO. Otherwise you should
select YES. This uses a little bit of memory. Adding this flag will
not slow a 386 down, other than using extra memory, but will speed
up a 486 quite a bit.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e2580.0x12d2968"></a>Types of Devices</h2></div></div><p>There are a series of questions which have to do with
different types of SCSI drivers and interfaces. If you have a SCSI
controller, then you would want to enable the drivers via the
configuration process. For those who don't have a SCSI controller,
select NO, and move on to the next step in the configuration. If
you don't select SCSI support, you won't be asked whether or not to
include SCSI devices.</p><p>Network device support mainly has to do with selecting the
proper Ethernet device or other network connection. PPP and SLIP
are used to connect to TCP/IP networks over the serial port; PLIP
is used to connect TCP/IP networks over the parallel port, and the
rest are ethernet controllers. <span   class="bold"><b>Do
not</b></span> select drivers of devices you do not have. This can
sometimes cause conflict later when you are booting.</p><p>Another important section in the kernel config process has to
do with the different filesystems. There is an advantage to
compiling the kernel to have only the filesystems you need. There
are several different filesystems supported by Linux:</p><p><b  >'Standard (minix) fs support' CONFIG_MINIX_FS
:</b></p><p>This is the <span   class="emphasis"><em>original</em></span> Linux filesystem.
It is considered to be one of the more stable filesystems, and is
still widely used. You probably want this unless you are really
desperate for space or will really never use it.</p><p><b  >'Extended fs support' CONFIG_EXT_FS
:</b></p><p>Only select this if you still have filesystems from the 'old
days' that will use this precursor of the second extended
filesystem. This filesystem is slow and no longer actively
maintained. It is there only for backwards compatibility.
NO.</p><p><b  >'Second extended fs support' CONFIG_EXT2_FS
:</b></p><p>The ext2 filesystem is the most 'full-featured' of the
filesystems. It is a super rewrite of the original extended
filesystem, with improved speed as well. This is by far the most
popular filesystem. A filesystem debugging package is available for
this filesystem that can help you recover from fairly bad
filesystem crashes. YES.</p><p><b  >'xiafs filesystem support' CONFIG_XIA_FS
:</b></p><p>This is a modification of the Minix filesystem (allowing for
such things as longer filenames). If you plan to use it (YES),
otherwise (NO).</p><p><b  >'msdos fs support' CONFIG_MSDOS_FS
:</b></p><p>This filesystem allows for access to the FAT filesystem used
by MS-DOS. It is a great advantage for those who need to access
floppies or hard disk partitions that use that filesystem. In
addition, if you use the UMSDOS filesystem (usually because you
installed Linux on an MSDOS partition), you need to include MSDOS
filesystem support.</p><p><b  >'/proc filesystem support' CONFIG_PROC_FS
:</b></p><p>The PROC filesystem does not touch your disk. It is used by
the kernel to provide data kept within the kernel itself to system
programs that need that information. Many standard utilities will
not function without this filesystem. YES.</p><p><b  >'NFS filesystem support' CONFIG_NFS_FS
:</b></p><p>The NFS filesystem is necessary for those who have a physical
network and need to mount NFS filesystems from other computers. If
you are on a TCP/IP network, you probably want this option.
Otherwise, you don't.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e2580.0x12d3308"></a>Possible Confusion</h2></div></div><p><b  >'Kernel profiling support' CONFIG_PROFILE
:</b></p><p>This is used only by seasoned kernel hackers. You don't need
this if you need to read this article...</p><p><b  >'Selection (cut and paste for virtual consoles)'
:</b></p><p>Self explanatory. If you want to be able to use your mouse in
any of your VC's, then you would select YES. Note that this
requires a separate <b  >selection</b> program to work.
Your mouse will be inactive without this program. This has nothing
to do with X-windows.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e2580.0x12d3620"></a>Sound Tricks</h2></div></div><p>The last section of the configuration process that needs
insight has to do with sound card options. If you want sound card
support, then you would definitely select YES. The confusing part
are the next two questions; confusing because of the order they
fall in.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Full driver?</b></span> NO. I select NO
because I want to configure my kernel to handle only my particular
sound card. I don't want to enable drivers for cards I don't have.
This simply wastes space.</p><p>Immediately following is:
<span   class="bold"><b>Disable?</b></span> NO. It seemed strange to
me that the driver question would come <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span>
a question about disabling the sound drivers altogether.
Nonetheless, you should select NO, and answer the questions that
follow accordingly, depending on what hardware you have.</p><p>That was the last part of the configuration process. All that
remains is to make the system dependencies. After that, the actual
kernel compile!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e2580.0x12d3938"></a>Making System Dependencies</h2></div></div><p>There isn't any confusing part about making the dependencies.
All you do is type <b  >make depend</b> (in the
<b  >/usr/src/linux</b> directory, which you should
already be in); this sets up the system dependencies that all the
files have. This allows <b  >make</b> to intelligently
recompile only the right files if you have to make changes to the
source code.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e2580.0x12d3b48"></a>Compiling the Kernel</h2></div></div><p>After the system dependencies have been created, you are
ready to compile the newly configured kernel. At this point, you
should type <b  >make zImage</b> to create a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>compressed</em></span> kernel. This helps in the process
of keeping your kernel small. Depending on the speed of your
machine, the amount of memory you have, and how many things you are
compiling into your kernel, your compile could take anywhere from
around 15 minutes on a fast 486 or Pentium to several hours on a
slow 386sx with 4MB of memory.</p><p>When the compiling process is complete, you will find a newly
created kernel, <b  >zImage</b>, in the
<b  >/usr/src/linux</b> directory. The process of
installing the new kernel however is not yet complete. If you
reboot right now, even though you have compiled a new kernel, you
will still boot your old kernel. You still need to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>install</em></span> the new kernel.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e2580.0x12d3e60"></a>Installing the New Kernel</h2></div></div><p>Before you install the new kernel, you should rename your old
kernel, so that you can use it in the case of an emergency. In the
<b  >/</b> directory, there should be an image of your
old kernel (<b  >zImage</b>). Simply rename it to
<b  >zImage.old</b> using the <b  >mv</b>
command. This will be useful in the event that your new kernel will
not boot up; you at least have a backup that still allows for a
functional system.</p><p>Now, you must edit (if necessary) the LILO configuration
file, so that it will accept your new kernel. It is most often
found in the file <b  >/etc/lilo/config</b>, but may be
found as <b  >/etc/lilo.conf</b>. Basically, editing the
configuration file and running <b  >lilo</b> tells the
LILO which kernel to use upon bootup. The first image to be set up
in the config file will be the default. By putting the new kernel
image first, we will ensure that the new kernel boots by default;
if we were to put the DOS entry first, DOS would boot by default.
Here's an example:</p><p><b  >boot = /dev/hda</b></p><p>#This is the path to the NEW kernel image to be bootedimage =
/zImagelabel = linux</p><p>#This is the path to the OLD kernel image to be booted#if the
other should fail to bootimage = /zImage.oldlabel =
linux.old</p><p>#This is the path to the DOS operating systemother =
/dev/hda1<b  >table = /dev/hdalabel = dos</b></p><p>Once you've edited the configuration file, copy or move the
new kernel image to the <b  >/</b> directory. Make sure
that <b  >/zImage</b> and <b  >/zImage.old</b>
are present before going any further. Next, you need to go back
into the <b  >/etc/lilo</b> directory and type
<b  >./lilo</b> to run <b  >lilo</b>.
Alternately (if <b  >/etc/lilo</b> doesn't exit), you may
need to <b  >cd</b> to <b  >/etc</b> and run
<b  >/sbin/lilo</b>. In either case, this is the
&ldquo;installation&rdquo; step which makes it possible for you to boot your
new kernel.</p><p>You are now ready to boot your new kernel. To do this, type
<b  >shutdown -r now</b>.</p><p>If you have not installed your new kernel as the default
kernel by making it the first entry in
<b  >/etc/lilo/config</b>, you will need to manually
select your new kernel as you boot up. You activate the LILO menu
by pressing &lt;shift&gt;, &lt;control&gt;, or &lt;alt keys&gt; as
LILO is starting, or by pressing the &lt;CapsLock&gt; or
&lt;ScrollLock&gt; key before LILO starts.</p><p>At the LILO prompt, make sure you type the
<span   class="bold"><b>label</b></span> of the image, and not the
filename of the image. If LILO can't find the image you ask for, it
will tell you. Typing <b  >?</b> will give you a list of
labels to choose from.</p><p>During the boot process, be sure to look at the information
that relates the version of the kernel being booted, and the day
that it was compiled (it's all on the same line). Mine looks like
this:</p><p><b  >Linux version 1.0.9 (root@HoMiEz.ShOpPiN.NeT) Thu
Jul 14 22:45:16 1994</b></p><p>This particular line tells which version of the kernel is
being booted, and the date and time that it was
<span   class="emphasis"><em>last</em></span> compiled. The information shown here
should coincide with the compile process you just recently
completed. If there is an inconsistency, be sure to check your
<b  >/etc/lilo/config</b> file. Make sure that you put
the proper label name for the particular table on the hard
drive.</p><p>Once the new kernel is booted, you are free to hack away.
Kernel compiling can be a confusing process. Some new
administrators are intimidated by compiling a new kernel, but it is
a prerequisite to running an optimized system. After a few kernel
upgrades, you can become skilled in maintaining your system
optimally. Then you can pass that knowledge to those who are as
unsure as you once were. Remember, the more you know about your own
system, the more optimized <span   class="bold"><b>you</b></span>
become in using it.</p><p><a name="unpack"></a>Unpacking the Linux Source</p><p>Before you unpack the kernel source, it is a good idea first
to backup you <span   class="emphasis"><em>old</em></span> kernel. You should do this,
just for the moment, until you completely get the new kernel
functioning properly. You can even shrink the size of the old
kernel source by using <b  >tar</b> and then compressing
it. It is better to use both, as a double strength method:</p><p><b  >cd /usr/srctar cvf linux-old.tar linuxgzip -9
linux-old.tar</b></p><p>The resulting file should be
<b  >linux-old.tar.gz</b>. After you've done this, it is
safe to remove the old source directory by typing:</p><p><b  >rm -rf linux</b></p><p>After you've done this, you can uncompress the new kernel.
You must first move the new kernel source to
<b  >/usr/src</b>. Then type the following:</p><p><b  >gunzip -c new-kernel-name.gz | tar xvof
-</b></p><p>Once this process is complete, you are ready to move on. I'd
also suggest keeping the new compressed kernel source in a backup
directory. This way, if an error occurs in the process of upgrading
and compiling your new kernel, you always have un-patched, &ldquo;virgin&rdquo;
source to start over with. This eliminates the time it takes to
download the kernel source again and also leaves you more time to
concentrate on the task at hand.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x11e2580.0x15e87f0"></a>Kernel Resources</h2></div></div><p>The kernel sources are available at a large number of Linux
<b  >ftp</b> sites, including
<b  >sunsite.unc.edu</b> in
<b  >/pub/Linux/kernel</b>,
<b  >tsx-11.mit.edu</b> in
<b  >/pub/linux/sources/system</b>, and
<b  >nic.funet.fi</b> in
<b  >/pub/OS/Linux/kernel/src</b>. Kernel sources stored
at these sites are typically gzipped tar files with filenames of
<b  >linux-<i><tt>version</tt></i>.tar.gz</b>.</p><p>If you got Linux from a distributor, they may have already
given you the kernel source. If they haven't, they are required by
the GNU General Public License to make it available to you.</p></div></div>
