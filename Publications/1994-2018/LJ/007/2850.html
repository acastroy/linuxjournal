    In this article Phil Hughes describes the basics of choosing
    a hardware platform for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167f580.0x17773a0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Although Linux software is virtually
free, the required hardware isn't. This makes some people hesitate
to jump into the Linux movement. But it doesn't need to be
complicated, scary or expensive. Linux runs on most common
hardware. In this article I will point out how to make the right
choices and hopefully keep you away from costly mistakes. If you
currently have a system that adequately runs MS-Windows, you
probably have all you need for a decent Linux system. Although
Linux is more sophisticated than MS-Windows, it doesn't require
more hardware. In fact, because Linux is a pre-emptive
multi-tasking system (this means that programs can be interrupted
to service other requests), you can get a lot more useful work from
the same computer. Before I get into specifics, I would like to
point out that there is a lot of documentation on Linux. This
includes HOWTOs which detail many of the specifics. These HOWTOs
are available at Linux archive sites on the Internet, on most
CD-ROM Linux distributions and on paper from various sources. A
short article is no substitute for the details presented in the
HOWTOs. I highly recommend that you get a copy and that you read
them.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167f580.0x17774a8"></a>CPU and RAM</h2></div></div><p>To run Linux you need a 386 or higher processor. For
text-based applications even a slow 386SX system will perform very
well. Although the Linux kernel is capable of emulating floating
point arithmetic functions, it is significantly slower than a math
co-processor; either in the form of a separate chip or a 486DX or
better that has a built-in co-processor. The server system at the
<i  >Linux Journal</i> advertising/editorial offices is
a 386DX40. It has proved to be a great performer with three
high-speed modem lines connected to it, a local user and 2 or more
active telnet sessions. It has 8MB of RAM but an upgrade to 16MB is
planned. The system we use for running X-windows is a 486DX33 with
16MB of RAM. The built-in co-processor and additional RAM make this
an excellent workstation for compute-intensive work. Linux needs a
system that is based on the ISA (AT) or EISA bus. Linux does not
support MicroChannel Architecture (MCA) machines such as the IBM
PS/2. It does, however, support local bus systems such as VESA and
PCI. What you need will depend on what you intend to do with the
system. The minimum RAM is 4MB. If you currently have a 386SX with
4MB of RAM, give it a try. It may do all that you want with no
investment. If, however, you need to purchase hardware to run
Linux, look at higher performance systems such as something based
on a 486DX chip and at least 8MB of RAM. The additional cost is not
very great for a large performance increase.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167f580.0x1777608"></a>Disks</h2></div></div><p>There are two considerations: type and size. Linux supports
MFM, RLL, ESDI and IDE disks with virtually any controller board.
It also supports a fairly wide assortment of SCSI controllers. If
you already have a system, you can probably stick with what you
have. But, if you are purchasing new hardware, SCSI disks are well
worth considering. Here's why: Many of the supported SCSI disk
controllers use direct memory access (DMA) to transfer information.
Under MS-DOS this has little advantage because MS-DOS (and
MS-Windows) waits for input/output operations. On Linux, however,
processing is overlapped with I/O. This means that a DMA controller
can be transferring data while the CPU is processing other tasks.
One of the most popular controllers supported by Linux is the
Adaptec AH-1542C. It is relatively inexpensive ($200 range), uses
DMA and has reasonable performance. For EISA bus systems, the
AH-1742 may be used. If your system has a VESA local bus, the
Buslogic 445S controller seems to offer the best performance at a
reasonable cost. Other supported SCSI controllers include the
Adaptec 152x series, Allways IN2000, Adaptec 1542 clones (including
Buslogic 445S and 447S and DTC 3290 and 3292), Seagate ST01 and
ST02, Western Digital 7000, Trantor T128 and T130B, Ultrastor 14F
and 24F. The SCSI HOWTO has many details that will help you weigh
the costs and performance of the various SCSI controllers. Another
consideration when choosing between IDE and SCSI disks is that you
can have two disks with IDE controllers and with SCSI you can have
up to seven. Selecting the disk size requires some forethought
about what applications you'll be running. The price of disk
storage is dropping, and you can add one or more disks later on
(depending upon your disk type). Linux can run on as small a
partition as 20MB, but 200MB is a common size. Some applications
may require disk sizes of 1GB or more.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167f580.0x1777710"></a>CD-ROM</h2></div></div><p>If you have a SCSI disk controller, a SCSI-based CD-ROM drive
makes the most sense. It plugs into the same controller and works
fine. With the advent of double and triple-speed CD-ROM drives,
prices have dropped significantly on the single-speed drives which
are adequate if all you intend to do is load files from a
distribution CD-ROM. And prices for these devices on the surplus
market seem to be in the $50-$80 range. If you are not using SCSI
disks, using a non-SCSI CD-ROM is more cost-effective. Although
others are supported, drives made by Mitsumi (and marketed under
many names including BSR and Tandy) work well. They include their
own controller card and can usually be found in the $150 price
range.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167f580.0x1777818"></a>Printers</h2></div></div><p>There is nothing special about Linux and printers. Standard
parallel port connections are supported as well as serial port
connections for printers. If you have a PostScript laser printer
there are programs included with most Linux distributions that
support these devices directly. If you don't have a PostScript
printer, ghostscript, a program that comes with most Linux
distributions, will translate PostScript into the necessary control
codes for most printers. If you choose this options, be aware that
ghostscript's default fonts are not as pretty as the fonts that
come with a PostScript printer.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167f580.0x1777920"></a>Serial Communications</h2></div></div><p>Serial devices which include mice, modems and terminals can
be connected to the system. Because Linux is multi-user as well as
multi-tasking, multiple people can be using the computer system at
one time. Most MS-DOS systems come with two serial ports. Linux can
use these ports but you may want additional ports to support
multiple devices. Serial communications boards come in various
flavors. The standard 2-port board that comes in most systems uses
16450 UARTs (Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitters). This
UART has no buffering which means the CPU must stop what it is
doing and grab each input character. For one line running at 38,400
bits per second, this means that the processor could have to get a
character about every .00025 seconds. With multiple ports this
could consume most of the CPU time and result in dropped
characters. The 16550A UART is very similar to the 16450 except it
has a built-in 16 character buffer. This means that the processor
could fetch characters 1/16th as often and still get all the input
data. The difference in price is not that big between boards based
on the 16450 and 16550A so it is well worth considering. Also, it
is possible to replace the 16450s with 16550As in boards where the
UARTS are in sockets. If you are considering adding ports, there
are various 4, 8 and 16-port boards that use 16550As and support
interrupt sharing. This means that up to 16 ports could be
configured all on one board using one interrupt line on the bus.
There are other serial communications boards that Linux supports or
will soon support. Intelligent serial boards are boards that
contain an on-board CPU. This CPU handles specifics of the serial
transfer, freeing up more of the main CPU. They vary from boards
with &ldquo;intelligent UARTS&rdquo; to those that include a general- purpose
CPU and DMA I/O. Many manufacturers including Spectrix, Stallion,
Computone, Arnet and DigiBoard make these boards. They require
special drivers and, at this time, the only one supported is the
Cyclades 8Y, which uses Cirrus Logic RISC chips. Performance-wise,
these boards should offer better performance than the 16550A-based
boards. An alternative to serial communications boards is a
terminal server. This is a device that connects to the host system
via Ethernet and handles serial communications itself. Any terminal
server that supports the TCP/IP protocol should work with a Linux
system.

FTP</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167f580.0x1777ad8"></a>Networking</h2></div></div><p>Linux has built-in support for networking including TCP/IP
and NFS. If you already have a network that supports TCP/IP
protocol (used by Unix and other systems) you should be able to add
your Linux box to the network. The one piece of hardware you will
need is an Ethernet adapter. Ethernet comes in three flavors:
thick-net, thin-net and UTP. Thick-net is thick coaxial cable where
you connect to it via a tap and a transceiver with an AUI
interface. Thick-net was the original but is no longer very
popular. Most common today is thin-net, with UTP running second.
Thin-net consists of machines connected on a single line of RG-58
coaxial cable. Each machine is connected using a BNC T-connector.
Each end of the line is terminated with a 50-ohm terminator. Adding
a new computer means either adding to the end of the line and
moving the terminator along or splitting an existing cable and
adding a new T. UTP (unshielded twisted pair) uses a different
configuration. You have a hub and then the systems fan out from the
hub. They are also called 10baseT where the T stands for twisted
pair. Generally, thin-net is the least expensive, most practical
approach. There are a large number of Ethernet boards out there. If
you are looking for the quick answer; reasonable cost, reliability
and reasonable performance, the WD8013 or SMC8013 card is a good
choice. Other cards that generally work are NE2000 clones and the
3Com 3c503. Again, the Ethernet-HOWTO contains much more helpful
information than I can include here.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167f580.0x1777be0"></a>Video</h2></div></div><p>Character-based Linux applications will work with any video
board available for the PC. If, however, you want to run X-windows,
you will need to select a supported video board. Although there is
nothing difficult about supporting any boards, some manufacturers
have refused to make the specifications available; therefore, Linux
drivers could not be written for their hardware. One major vendor
who has not released specifications (and is therefore not
supported) is Diamond. The most cost-effective accelerated video
boards supported by Linux are the low-end S3 boards. STB and Orchid
are two vendors who have cards available for about $130-$150 that
will be adequate for almost all Linux users. High-end S3 and ATI
boards which are supported are available in the $350-$500, and will
increase your video performance. You will want to check the
XFree86-HOWTO for more current details when you are making your
decision.

High-Performance Systems</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x167f580.0x1777d98"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>Shopping for Linux hardware isn't harder than shopping for
DOS/Windows hardware. If you are comfortable selecting video boards
and talking about RAM chips, you should have no problem selecting
what you need. On the other hand, if you don't want to know what a
SCSI is, you may be better off to let someone else pick the
hardware for you. Much like picking DOS/Windows hardware, define
what you want to do; what sort of things you will be running on the
computer system. Then give your requirements to a
Linux-knowledgeable hardware vendor and see what they have to
offer. Whether you do your own hardware selection or just get some
ideas from this article and let someone else pick, expect the end
result to be a real Unix-like com-puter system; for your work, for
fun or for both.
