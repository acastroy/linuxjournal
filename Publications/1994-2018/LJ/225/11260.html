Have you ever wanted to log in to your system from a hotel kiosk or
Internet caf&eacute;? That's risky business, but Todd A. Jacobs shows you how
to work hard and play safe on public terminals. Todd walks you through
the configuration and day-to-day usage of one-time password
authentication using OTPW, and even shows you how to integrate it with
SSH. Sadly, he offers no advice on what coffee tastes best while
connecting safely from a trendy hotspot.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212a580.0x2222250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Password authentication contains a lot of assumptions about security and
trust. Encrypted SSH tunnels and public key verification are two common
ways to ensure that your password is not compromised in transit. But,
what if it's the computer you're currently typing on that can't be
trusted?
</p><p>
This isn't just a tinfoil-hat scenario for paranoid penguinistas. There
are many everyday situations and common locations where you probably
should <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> use your system password, even over a secure tunnel.
Examples include:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
A public computer in a hotel, library or Internet caf&eacute;.
</p></li><li><p>
A coworker's virus-infested computer.
</p></li><li><p>
A shared workstation while pair-programming.
</p></li><li><p>
Any place someone could watch you type in your password.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
What do all these examples have in common? Essentially, that you're
trying to connect to a trusted destination from an untrusted source.
This is a complete reversal of what most authentication systems were
designed to address.
</p><p>
Take public key authentication. SSH public key authentication certainly
bypasses the password prompt on the remote host, but it still requires you
to trust the local machine with your private key password. In addition,
once the key is decrypted with your password, the local system has full
access to the sensitive key material inside.
</p><p>
Uh-oh&mdash;luckily, there's already a solution for this
frequently overlooked problem: one-time passwords.
</p><p>
The combination of SSH and one-time passwords is powerful:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
The SSH protocol provides encryption of the login sequence across the
network.
</p></li><li><p>
A good SSH client allows you to inspect the remote host's public key
fingerprint before entering your credentials. This prevents a rogue
host from collecting your one-time passwords.
</p></li><li><p>
The one-time password system ensures that a password can't be reused.
So, even if the password is captured in transit, it's worthless to an
attacker once you've logged in with it.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
A number of one-time password solutions are available for
UNIX-like systems. The two most well-known are S/KEY and OPIE (One-Time
Passwords in Everything).
</p><p>
With the recent removal of OPIE from the Debian and Ubuntu repositories, the OTPW one-time password system
created by Markus Kuhn provides a viable alternative. Although not a
drop-in replacement for OPIE, OTPW offers comparable functionality while
providing some interesting features not found in either S/KEY or OPIE.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212a580.0x2222ca0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>OPIE Removal from Debian and Ubuntu Repositories</b></p><p>
Debian began removing OPIE-related packages in early 2011, following
some discussions about the security of the binaries, licensing issues
and lack of upstream activity.
</p><p>
If you're interested in the details, the following Debian bug reports
are relevant:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=511582" target="_self">bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=511582</a>
</p></li><li><p>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=622220" target="_self">bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=622220</a>
</p></li><li><p>

</p></li><li><p>
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=622246" target="_self">bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=622246</a>
</p></li></ul></div><p>
While the OPIE packages remain in the current Debian stable release at the time of
this writing
(code-named &ldquo;Squeeze&rdquo;), and some unofficial platform ports can be found
in the debports repository, OPIE is not available in testing or
unstable, and it appears unlikely to be included in the next stable
release.
</p></div><p>
In particular, OTPW provides:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Two-factor authentication, consisting of a &ldquo;prefix password&rdquo; and a set
of autogenerated, disposable suffixes. Even if the list of suffixes
falls into the wrong hands, brute force is necessary without the prefix
password.
</p></li><li><p>
Protection against certain race conditions and man-in-the-middle
attacks through the use of password locks and triplet challenges.
</p></li><li><p>
Shared-filesystem support. Because OTPW checks passwords against a list
of hashed values stored in a user's home directory, one password list
will work for all systems mounting the same $HOME directory.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Next, I cover installing and using OTPW, with a special focus on
integration with OpenSSH.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212a580.0x22237a0"></a>
Package Installation</h2></div></div><p>
To make use of OTPW, you need two binaries:
otpw-bin and libpam-otpw.
With Debian and Ubuntu, installation is as easy as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo apt-get install otpw-bin libpam-otpw
</pre>
</p><p>
If your distribution does not provide OTPW, you can download the source
directly from the author's home page. The source tarball does not use
GNU autoconf, so you will need to compile and install the
binaries manually in accordance with the author's instructions.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212a580.0x2223958"></a>
Configure PAM</h2></div></div><p>
The next step in preparing the system for OTPW is configuration of
libpam-otpw. A full treatment of PAM is outside the scope of this
article, but I cover the most common use cases here.
</p><p>
Changing your PAM configuration can lock you out of your workstation or
server, so it's a good idea to keep your existing terminal open until
you're sure that things are working correctly. If you have console
access, keep a bootable distribution or rescue disk handy. See the Testing
One-Time Password Authentication with SSH sidebar
for more information about
testing PAM over SSH.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212a580.0x2223ab8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Testing One-Time Password Authentication with SSH</b></p><p>
If you are configuring a remote system for OTPW, you should test your
PAM stack without closing your current SSH connection. Remember, if you
make a mistake with your PAM configuration, you may be unable to
authenticate&mdash;even with console access&mdash;so keep a bootable
distribution,
such as Knoppix, SystemRescueCD or Finnix handy just in case.
Meanwhile, existing logins remain unaffected because they already
are authenticated.
</p><p>
In order to test the PAM stack properly, you can't re-use your existing
SSH connection. Most recent distributions support SSH multiplexing and
persistent connections out of the box, so explicitly disable these
options for testing.
</p><p>
In addition, SSH prefers public key authentication by default. So, in
order to test OTPW authentication, public key authentication needs to be
temporarily disabled too.
</p><p>
The following invocation enables accurate testing of the SSH PAM stack,
without making any system changes:

<pre     class="programlisting">

read -p 'Hostname: ' REMOTE_HOST &amp;&amp;
SSH_AGENT_PID= SSH_AUTH_SOCK= \
  ssh \
  -o PreferredAuthentications=keyboard-interactive \
  -o ControlPersist=no \
  -o ControlPath=none \
  "$REMOTE_HOST"

</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have confidence that OTPW is working correctly, you also
should verify that your other authentication mechanisms (namely SSH public keys
and normal system passwords) continue to work as expected.
</p></div><p>
The easiest way to enable OTPW is to put it immediately above
<tt  >pam_unix</tt>
in your common-auth configuration file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/pam.d/common-auth
auth       sufficient pam_otpw.so
session    optional   pam_otpw.so

auth       sufficient pam_unix.so nullok_secure
auth       required   pam_deny.so
</pre>
</p><p>
The order of the PAM libraries is very important. When placing OTPW
first, users with an ~/.otpw file are prompted for a one-time password
first, allowing fallback to standard system passwords if the OTPW login
fails. Users without a ~/.otpw file simply will see the standard
password prompt.
</p><p>
If you prefer to reverse the order, prompting for a system password
before falling back to one-time passwords, just ensure that
<tt  >pam_deny</tt>
comes last:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/pam.d/common-auth
auth       sufficient pam_unix.so nullok_secure

auth       sufficient pam_otpw.so
session    optional   pam_otpw.so

auth       required   pam_deny.so
</pre>
</p><p>
If you're tempted to remove standard system passwords altogether,
especially from console logins, please don't. On some systems, most
notably Ubuntu systems with ecryptfs-encrypted home directories,
recovering from OTPW mishaps is extremely difficult without standard
system passwords.
</p><p>
Modifying common-auth is usually the right thing to do on a headless
server or console-only system. However, workstations or servers that
provide the X Window System present special problems for one-time password
systems.
</p><p>
Some tools or applications won't work properly with OTPW because they
can't display the challenge to the user. The typical symptom is usually
a password dialog that never completes or seems to ignore user input. In
times past, gksu and GNOME Display Manager (GDM) had this issue with
OPIE. In such cases, the solution is to move OTPW out of common-auth
and include it only in specific services.
</p><p>
For example, you can add OTPW authentication to SSH connections while
using just the standard password prompt for console or GUI logins. You
can do this in three easy steps:
</p><p>
1. Delete any lines from common-auth that reference pam_otpw.so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/pam.d/common-auth on Debian Squeeze
auth       sufficient pam_unix.so nullok_secure
auth       required   pam_deny.so
</pre>
</p><p>
2. Create a new OTPW include file for PAM:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/pam.d/otpw
auth           sufficient      pam_otpw.so
session        optional        pam_otpw.so
</pre>
</p><p>
3. Include OTPW immediately <span   class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> common-auth in /etc/pam.d/sshd:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# Other stuff ...

# Enable OTPW authentication.
@include otpw

# Standard Un*x authentication.
@include common-auth

# More stuff ...
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212a580.0x221ad98"></a>
SSH Configuration</h2></div></div><p>
In addition to configuring the PAM libraries, OTPW needs the following
three settings in the SSH d&aelig;mon's configuration file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config
UsePrivilegeSeparation yes
UsePAM yes
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
</pre>
</p><p>
These are usually there, but possibly commented out or set to
&ldquo;no&rdquo;, so
modify them accordingly. Next, reload the SSH d&aelig;mon after
modifying its configuration file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# Generic Linux
sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload

# Debian 6.0.4+
sudo service ssh reload

# Ubuntu 11.04+
sudo reload ssh
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212a580.0x221b000"></a>
Generating OTPW Passwords</h2></div></div><p>
Once the OTPW PAM module has been configured properly, only users with
an ~/.otpw file will be challenged with a one-time password dialog
during login. This file contains some metadata about its contents, as
well as a list of one-way hashes that will match only a valid response
to a challenge.
</p><p>
To create this file, or to re-populate it with new passwords, use the
otpw-gen utility. By default, it will create 280 password suffixes,
formatted to fit on a single side of US letter-sized (8.5" x 11") paper.
Because only the one-way hashes are stored in ~/.otpw, not the passwords
themselves, you must capture or print the standard output of this
command when the passwords are generated. You will not be able to
retrieve the password list after the fact; you'll need to generate new
passwords instead.
</p><p>
Here is what it looks like when you run the command for the first time,
piping the output to your default printer:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ otpw-gen | lpr
Generating random seed ...

If your paper password list is stolen, the thief
should not gain access to your account with this
information alone. Therefore, you need to memorize
and enter below a prefix password. You will have to
enter that each time directly before entering the
one-time password (on the same line).

When you log in, a 3-digit password number will be
displayed. It identifies the one-time password on
your list that you have to append to the prefix
password. If another login to your account is in
progress at the same time, several password numbers
may be shown and all corresponding passwords have to
be appended after the prefix password. Best generate
a new password list when you have used up half of
the old one.

Enter new prefix password:
Reenter prefix password:

Creating '~/.otpw'.
Generating new one-time passwords ...
</pre>
</p><p>
When generating a new password list, the prompts that appear on standard
error are slightly different:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Overwrite existing password list '~/.otpw' (Y/n)?

Enter new prefix password:
Reenter prefix password:

Creating '~/.otpw'.
Generating new one-time passwords ...
</pre>
</p><p>
The first prompt ensures that you don't accidentally over-write your existing
password list; the second prompt asks you for a new password. There's
nothing stopping you from reusing the same prefix password on each
invocation&mdash;the random seed makes duplicate hashes unlikely&mdash;but best
practice is to use a new prefix each time you regenerate the password
list.
</p><p>
If you want to generate a password list on a remote host but print to a
local printer, you can do this over your SSH connection as long as you
trust your localhost:

<pre     class="programlisting">

read -p 'Hostname: ' &amp;&amp;
{
    stty -echo
    ssh "$REPLY" otpw-gen | lpr
    stty echo
}

</pre>
</p><p>
Note the use of <tt  >stty</tt> to ensure that your prefix password isn't echoed to
the screen. As long as your prefix password remains secure, you are no
worse off using an untrusted printer than you are if your password list
falls into the wrong hands. This is often a valuable security trade-off
for frequent travelers.
</p><p>
Finally, to disable OTPW challenges for a given user, just delete the
.otpw file in that user's home directory.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212a580.0x221b4d0"></a>
Using OTPW to Log In</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have your password list in hand, you're ready to use one-time
password authentication for your SSH connection. Assuming that you don't
have any identities loaded into your SSH agent, your dialog should look
similar to this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh localhost
Password 015:
</pre>
</p><p>
The prompt with the digits is the OTPW challenge. To respond, find the
matching challenge ID on the password sheet you printed earlier. Next,
enter your prefix password followed by the string that follows the
challenge ID.
</p><p>
Using &ldquo;foo&rdquo; as a prefix password, the following suffix list was
generated. Your list and suffixes will be different, even if you use the
same prefix password.


<pre     class="programlisting">
OTPW list generated 2012-05-06 13:40 on localhost

000 SWvv JGk5 004 =qfF q2Mv 008 sb5P h94r 012 o5aH +/GD 016 8eLV VxuA

            !!! REMEMBER: Enter the PREFIX PASSWORD first !!!
</pre>
</p><p>
To respond to this challenge successfully, type:

<pre     class="programlisting">
foo fWI% MB9e
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212a580.0x221b898"></a></h2></div></div><p>
at the prompt. The spaces are optional; OTPW ignores them if present.
</p><p>
If you answered the challenge correctly, login will proceed. Otherwise,
you will be prompted with the standard system login. At this point, you
can enter your standard system password, or press Return to give OTPW
another try. After the system-defined number of password attempts
(usually three), the login will fail and return you to the command
prompt:


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh localhost
Password 013:
Password:
Password 013:
Password:
Password 013:
Password:
Permission denied (publickey,password,keyboard-interactive).
</pre>
</p><p>
To prevent simultaneous logins, or when SSH is interrupted during OTPW
authentication, OTPW may lock a password. When a password is locked,
your next login attempt will present a triplet challenge that requires
one prefix and three suffixes to respond:

<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh localhost
Password 004/011/005:
</pre>
</p><p>
Given the same password list as before, enter your triplet response as a
single line, with or without spaces. The following shows how the
response is composed (note that the first line below is just an
informational aid; you would type only the second line below, without the
pipe characters):

<pre     class="programlisting">
prefix | suffix 004 | suffix 011 | suffix 005
foo    | =qfF q2Mv  | fNKT vo84  | B=bq =mHN
</pre>
</p><p>
Once you have successfully responded to a triplet challenge, login will
proceed and the ~/.otpw.lock symlink should be removed, and your next
challenge will again be a single challenge ID number.
</p><p>
In some cases, the lock is not removed properly. If you continue to be
prompted for a triplet, you can remove the lockfile manually:

<pre     class="programlisting">
rm ~/.otpw.lock
</pre>
</p><p>
Users with encrypted home directories that are not already mounted
before login will need to take a few additional steps. See the
OTPW and Encrypted Home Directories sidebar for an example.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x212a580.0x221bd68"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
OTPW and Encrypted Home Directories</b></p><p>
The ecryptfs filesystem presents special problems for SSH and OTPW. By
default, distributions like Ubuntu unwrap the special passphrase
required to mount an encrypted home directory with the user's system
password.
</p><p>
This is handled by the pam_ecryptfs.so module, which is included
through /etc/pam.d/common-auth and others. If you authenticate using
anything other than your system password, the module prompts you for a
system login password in order to mount the encrypted home directory.
</p><p>
In practice, this means that your system password is exposed on
untrusted terminals when mounting your remote home directory. This is
obviously not ideal.
</p><p>
The best way to avoid this is to leave a console session running at all
times. For example, log in at the console using your system password,
and then lock the screen. As long as your console session remains
active, your home directory remains mounted. As a result, you can use
OTPW authentication without further changes to the system, and you won't
reveal your system password during login or mounting.
</p><p>
However, if you still want to be able to use OTPW for SSH logins when a
console session isn't running&mdash;and understand the security implications
of doing so&mdash;here's how it's done.
</p><p>
First, you need to create a wrapper script for calling otpw-gen:

<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
set -e
otpw-gen "$@"
mv ~/.otpw /usr/local/lib/otpw/$LOGNAME/
ln -s /usr/local/lib/otpw/$LOGNAME/.otpw ~/
</pre>
</p><p>
The wrapper should be placed in your path
and made executable.
</p><p>
Next, place otpw4ecryptfs.sh (listed below) in ~/bin or
/usr/local/sbin:

<pre     class="programlisting">

#!/bin/bash

# Purpose:
#     Enable OTPW for all users on systems with
#     ecryptfs-mounted home directories.

set -e

# Expose the underlying directories that may be
# hidden by ecryptfs.
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/real_home
sudo mount -o bind /home /mnt/real_home

# Collect all non-system users.
users=$(
    awk -F: '$1 != "nobody" \
             &amp;&amp; $3 &gt;= 1000  \
             &amp;&amp; $3 &lt; 65534  \
             {print $1}' /etc/passwd
)

# Enable OTPW for each non-system user.
for user in $users; do
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/otpw/$user
    sudo touch /usr/local/lib/otpw/$user/.otpw
    sudo chown -R $user: /usr/local/lib/otpw/$user
    sudo chmod 755 /mnt/real_home/$user
    ln -sf /usr/local/lib/otpw/$user/.otpw \
           /mnt/real_home/$user/
    ln -sf /usr/local/lib/otpw/$user/.otpw \
           /home/$user/
done &lt; /etc/passwd

sudo umount /mnt/real_home

</pre>
</p><p>
When you run the script, it creates OTPW files that are
readable by pam_otpw.so even when the user's home directory is
unmounted.
</p><p>
Please note that this script gives read and execute permissions to all
users' home directories so that pam_otpw.so can read the OTPW password
files. This is not inherently a risk, but users who rely on more
restrictive directory permissions may want to tighten up the permissions
of files and folders in their home directories immediately afterward.
</p><p>
Finally, all users should run <tt  >otpw-gen-wrapper.sh</tt> to populate and
maintain their OTPW password list. Always use the wrapper instead of
calling otpw-gen directly, or password generation will break the
symlinks required for proper operation.

Check for Remaining Passwords</h2></div></div><p>
If your password list is exhausted, you will no longer be able to use
OTPW to log in until a new list is generated. Likewise, if your password
list doesn't contain at least three unused responses, you will not be
able to use OTPW to log in when ~/.otpw.lock exists, because there are
not enough challenge IDs to issue a triplet.
</p><p>
In addition, some of the security of OTPW comes from the randomness of
the remaining challenges. The use of triplets in particular can 
exhaust your unused passwords rapidly, so it's a good idea to regenerate the
password list whenever you fall below a minimum amount.
</p><p>
The OTPW author recommends regenerating the password list when less than
half the original passwords remain unused, but doesn't define a minimum
bound for number of passwords required for adequate randomness of
challenges. A small number of unused passwords makes you more vulnerable
to brute-force attacks, since there are fewer challenges to present.
</p><p>
The pam_otpw.so PAM module is supposed to inform the user when unused
passwords fall below half of those generated. However, the PAM session
functionality doesn't seem to work on Debian or Ubuntu. In addition,
even if it worked, the module doesn't establish a floor to ensure
sufficient randomness of challenges.
</p><p>
The otwp-stats.sh script shown in Listing 1 provides this missing functionality. It also
allows you to define a sensible minimum for unused passwords by
adjusting the MIN_PASSWORDS variable at the top of the script.

Add otwp-stats.sh to your ~/.profile (or other shell startup script)
to provide feedback at login:

<pre     class="programlisting">

# Only run script when logging in via SSH.
[ -n "$SSH_CONNECTION" ] &amp;&amp; ~/bin/otpw-stats.sh

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
OTPW provides a one-time password implementation that compares favorably
against OPIE and S/KEY. It is easy to integrate with SSH on most Linux
systems, and remains possible to use on Ubuntu systems with encrypted
home directories.
