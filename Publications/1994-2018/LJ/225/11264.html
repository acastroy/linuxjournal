Elliptic Curve Cryptography provides stronger security at much
smaller key sizes than an RSA. This article explains how it works
and how to use it with OpenSSH.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263e580.0x2736250"></a></h2></div></div><p>
When it comes to public key cryptography, most systems today are still stuck in
the 1970s. On December 14, 1977, two events occurred that would change the
world: Paramount Pictures released <span   class="emphasis"><em>Saturday Night
Fever</em></span>, and MIT filed the
patent for RSA. Just as <span   class="emphasis"><em>Saturday Night Fever</em></span> helped popularize disco through its
choreography and soundtrack, RSA helped popularize cryptography by allowing two
parties to communicate securely without a shared secret.
</p><p>
Public key techniques, such as RSA, have revolutionized cryptography and form the
basis for Web site encryption via SSL/TLS, server administration via SSH, secure
e-mail and IP encryption (IPsec). They do this by splitting the shared secret
key used in traditional cryptography into two parts: a public key for
identifying
oneself and a secret key for proving an identity electronically. Although the
popularity of disco has waned, most Web sites today that use encryption still
are using RSA.
</p><p>
Since the 1970s, newer techniques have been developed that offer better security
with smaller key sizes than RSA. One major breakthrough is the development of
cryptography based on the mathematical theory of elliptic curves, called ECC 
(Elliptic Curve Cryptography). Although ECC has a reputation for being quite
complex, it has been integrated into popular open-source cryptographic software
including OpenSSH and OpenSSL, and it's not inherently any more difficult to use than
RSA. In this article, I describe ECC and show how it can be used with recent
versions of OpenSSH and OpenSSL.
</p><p>
Not all cryptographic algorithms are equal. For a fixed key or output length,
one algorithm may provide much more security than another. This is particularly
true when comparing different types of algorithms, such as comparing public and
symmetric key algorithms. To help make sense of this, the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) reviews the academic literature on attacking
cryptographic algorithms and makes recommendations on the actual security provided
by different algorithms (see Table 1 from 2011).
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x263e580.0x2736618"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. NIST Recommended Key Sizes</b></p><table     summary="Table 1.

<span   class="emphasis"><em>Note: for
new applications, I think AES-128 should be used over triple DES even if
128-bit
security isn't needed. Attacks have been found on SHA-1, and NIST now
estimates that SHA-1 provides
only 69 bits of security in digital signature applications.</em></span>
</p><p>
If the system you are designing is expected to protect information
only until 2030, NIST recommends that you use cryptography providing at least 112
bits of security. For applications that need longer-term protection, NIST
recommends at least 128 bits of security.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263e580.0x2737590"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Department of Defense Requirements</b></p><p>
Although NIST guidance is well respected, the Department of Defense has stronger
requirements for classified information. For the Defense Department, 128 bits is
only good enough for protecting information classified SECRET. Use of RSA isn't
approved, and TOP SECRET information requires use of AES-256, SHA-384 and ECC
with a 384-bit key size. Furthermore, systems must use two separate encryption
implementations for protection. For example, use both IPsec and TLS, so that the
information is still protected by one layer if a flaw in the other is found.
Although this may not be very practical for most Internet applications, it's
interesting to see what the requirements are when security is paramount.
</p></div><p>
Just because NIST makes these recommendations, doesn't mean that applications
follow them. Many Web sites, including on-line banks, still will use SHA-1 and
pair it with AES 128 and a 1024- or 2048-bit RSA key. According to NIST,
achieving true 128-bit security means that the RSA key should be at least 3072
bits&mdash;a size most Internet certificate authorities don't even
offer. At
present, Verisign will sell you an SSL certificate that it claims offers
&ldquo;256-bit security&rdquo;, because you can use it with AES-256. The signature itself
uses SHA-1 and a 2048-bit RSA key.
</p><p>
At present, the security on the Internet is still sufficiently weak that it 
almost always will be easier to find a vulnerability that allows an attacker to
bypass security rather than directly attack the encryption. However, it is still
worthwhile to be aware of how much security the overall encryption
implementation provides. In cryptography, more bits are usually better, but an
implementation is only as strong as its weakest length. Both ECC and SHA-2
represent essential algorithms to getting real 128-bit or 256-bit
security.

The Mathematics of Elliptic Curve Cryptography</h2></div></div><p>
Elliptic Curve Cryptography has a reputation for being complex and highly
technical. This isn't surprising when the Wikipedia article introduces
an elliptic curve as &ldquo;a smooth, projective algebraic curve of genus
one&rdquo;. 
Elliptic curves also show up in the proof of Fermat's last theorem and the
Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. You can win a million dollars if you
solve that problem.
</p><p>
To get a basic understanding of ECC, you need to understand four things:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The definition of an elliptic curve.
</p></li><li><p>
The elliptic curve group.
</p></li><li><p>
Scalar multiplication over the elliptic curve group.
</p></li><li><p>
Finite field arithmetic.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
Essentially, elliptic curves are points on that satisfy an equation with the
form:
</p><p>
y<sup  >2</sup> = x<sup  >3</sup> + ax + b 
</p><p>
Figure 1 shows a picture of an elliptic curve over the real numbers where a
is &ndash;1
and b is 1. Elliptic curves satisfy some interesting mathematical properties. The
curve is symmetric around the x axis, so that if (x,y) is a point on the curve,
then (x,&ndash;y) is also on the curve. If you draw a line between any two points on
the line with different x coordinates, they will intersect the line at a
unique third point. Finally, for each point on the curve, if you draw a straight
line tangent to the cover from that point, it will intersect the curve once
again at another point.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11264f1.large.jpg"><img src="11264f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Elliptic Curve over Real Numbers
</p></div></div><p>
Mathematicians use these properties to form a structure called a group from the
points on the elliptic curve. A group consists of a set of elements containing a
special point (denoted <span   class="bold"><b>0</b></span>), an operation
for negating an element (denoted &ndash;x),
and an operation for adding two elements (denoted x + y). The elements in the
group defined by an elliptic curve consist of the points on the curve plus an
additional point for <span   class="bold"><b>0</b></span> that is not on the
curve, but as you'll see below is
easiest to visualize as a line on the x-axis. To negate a point, you just
negate the y-coordinate of the point, and adding a point to its negation
is defined to return <span   class="bold"><b>0</b></span> (Figure 2). To add two points P and Q with different
x-coordinates, draw a line connecting the two points and extending beyond them.
This line should intersect the curve at a third point. The sum R = P + Q is the
negation of the third point. Finally, to add a point P to itself, draw the line
tangent to P (Figure 3). The sum R = 2P is the negation of the point that
line intersects (Figure 4).
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11264f2.large.jpg"><img src="11264f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

Figure 4. Doubling a Point
</p></div></div><p>
Once the group is defined, we can talk about scalar multiplication&mdash;the
fundamental operation that makes elliptic curves useful in cryptography.
The kth scalar multiple of P is the point obtained
by adding P to itself k times. This can be done efficiently by representing
k as a binary number and using a double-and-add multiplication method.
If you are familiar with RSA, scalar multiplication plays a similar role in ECC
that modular exponentiation plays in RSA.
</p><p>
The real numbers used in diagrams for explaining ECC are not practical to use
in actual implementations. Real numbers can have an arbitrary number of digits,
and computers have only a finite amount of memory. Most applications, including
OpenSSL, use elliptic curves over coordinates that use modular arithmetic, where
the modulus is a large prime number. Figure 5 shows the elliptic curve with
the same equation as in Figure 1, but where arithmetic is performed modulo 19.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11264f5.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 5. Elliptic Curve over Prime Field (mod 19)
</p></div></div><p>
For the different key sizes in Table 1, NIST recommends a specific elliptic curve
with a prime modulus for that key size (see the Binary Fields sidebar). For each key size,
NIST specifies three things:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The coefficients in the elliptic curve equation.
</p></li><li><p>
The size of the underlying field for representing x and y. 
</p></li><li><p>
A <span   class="emphasis"><em>base point</em></span> that is a point of the curve to be used when calling scalar multiplication.
</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x263e580.0x272f5d8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>Binary Fields</b></p><p>
For each bit size, NIST also recommends two other elliptic curves over
a type of field called a binary field. Although prime fields are more
common in software, binary fields are common when implementing ECC in
low-power hardware. I focus on prime curves in this article, because
that's what OpenSSL uses, and there are a lot more patents on binary
curve implementations than prime curves. Unless you have some specific
hardware needs and also money to spend on lawyers to deal with patents,
I'd recommend sticking to prime curves.
</p></div><p>

To see how big the numbers for a 256-bit curve are, the NIST P-256 curve
equation has the coeffients a=&ndash;3 and
b =
41058363725152142129326129780047268409114441015993725554835256314039467401291.
</p><p>
The coordinates are in a prime field modulo p_256 where:
</p><p>
p_256 = 2<sup  >256</sup> &ndash; 2<sup  >224</sup>
+2<sup  >192</sup> +2<sup  >96</sup> &ndash; 1
</p><p>
The base point is
G=(x<sub  >G</sub>,y<sub  >G</sub>) 
and defined by:
</p><p>
x<sub  >G</sub> = 48439561293906451759052585252797914202762949526041747995844080717082404635286
</p><p>
y<sub  >G</sub> = 36134250956749795798585127919587881956611106672985015071877198253568414405109
</p><p>
If these numbers look big to you, just think that the 256-bit elliptic curve is equivalent
to RSA with 3072-bit numbers. RSA public keys contain more than 12 times the number of
digits.
</p><p>
If you'd like to learn more about Elliptic Curve Cryptography, there are
many references
available. Certicom, a company founded by some of the inventors of ECC,
hosts an on-line tutorial at <a href="http://www.certicom.com/ecc-tutorial" target="_self">www.certicom.com/ecc-tutorial</a>. For a
more comprehensive understanding of cryptography, the book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Understanding
Cryptography</em></span> by Christof Paar, Jan Pelzl and Bart Preneel has a chapter
about ECC and also covers the AES and SHA.
I've just touched the basic definitions here, and I've not discussed the
optimizations used
to make a high-performance implementation like the one in OpenSSL. For a
quite comprehensive reference on fast ECC algorithms, the &ldquo;Handbook of
Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www.hyperelliptic.org/HEHCC" target="_self">www.hyperelliptic.org/HEHCC</a>) has yet to let me down.

Using Elliptic Curve Cryptography in OpenSSH</h2></div></div><p>
A little more than a year ago, OpenSSH 5.7 added support for ECC-based cryptography.
Although it's still not in every Linux distribution, support for ECC finally
is becoming widespread enough that it's starting to be worth considering a migration.
Support for ECC requires OpenSSH version 5.7 or later and OpenSSL version
0.9.8g or later.
OpenSSH can use ECC both to help you authenticate that you really are talking to
the server you want and to help the server perform key-based authentication of
users.
</p><p>
Host authentication is used by the client to authenticate the server. It is used
to detect man-in-the-middle attacks and normally is set up automatically and
used by OpenSSH. When OpenSSH is installed, it should create one or more host
keys, which normally are stored in /etc/ssh. The ECC private key normally
is named <tt  >ssh_host_ecdsa_key</tt>, and the corresponding
public key normally is named
<tt  >ssh_host_ecdsa_key.pub</tt>. See the man pages for
<tt  >sshd_config</tt> if you would like
to change this path. Just make sure that the private key can be read only by
authorized admins; anybody with access to the host private key potentially
could impersonate the server.
</p><p>
Client authentication is used to authenticate the client against the server.
Using keys to authenticate rather than passwords is both more convenient
(because
you can use <tt  >ssh-agent</tt> or another program to cache
the key) and more secure (because
the password is never sent in plain text to the server). If you have used SSH for
significant work in the past, you've probably set this up using RSA keys, and
the exact same process, namely using <tt  >ssh-keygen</tt>, is used to create ECC keys.
The only difference is to pass <tt  >-tecdsa</tt> to create the key. The man page for
<tt  >ssh-keygen</tt> will have more details, and there are many tutorials for setting
up SSH keys available on-line if you need a walk-through. 
</p><p>
For most people, once encryption software supporting ECC is more widely deployed,
converting to ECC should be quick and painless. RSA still is probably
&ldquo;good enough&rdquo;
for most applications, but ECC is significantly more secure, and it may be essential
to getting strong security on tiny, low-power, networked devices that are becoming
more widespread. Its introduction into open-source tools like OpenSSL and OpenSSH
is definitely a great step toward gaining more widespread use.
