<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #225, January 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Linus Torvalds</b></span> recently explained why
<span   class="bold"><b>ABI</b></span> (Application Binary Interface) changes
are virtually never acceptable in the kernel. He even said that the existing ABI
trumps published standards and specifications. He'd rather keep a non-compliant
ABI than fix it if even a single user relied on that ABI.
</p><p>
He listed off what he considered to be the valid reasons to change the ABI. In
each case, he said, there was a real external reason justifying the
change:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
Security: in some cases, an ABI has exposed too much information, and that
just had to be fixed. Security trumps user convenience.
</p></li><li><p>
Implementation: in rare corner-cases, an ABI has just been bad. It's made it
into the official kernel, but in a nightmare-Frankenstein way that really didn't
work right. Apparently, a bad enough breakage could justify a fix.
</p></li><li><p>
Applications: in some cases, an application should have been portable to
Linux, but broke because of the ABI. A fix in that case was warranted.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
And aside from the security case, Linus felt that it made more sense to maintain
a compatibility layer that included the old behavior, just in case anything
really did depend on the old ABI. So it would be cruft, but it would be our
cruft, and we'd protect it.
</p><p>
Linus closed his e-mail/rant by saying that anyone who intentionally wanted to
change an ABI for some reason other than the ones listed above, or because a
change crept in accidentally and needed to be reverted, should not work on the
kernel or on library development either&mdash;harsh.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Dan Luedtke</b></span> has produced <span   class="bold"><b>LanyFS</b></span>, a new minimalist Flash filesystem. The idea is
that it would work with anything&mdash;even <span   class="bold"><b>Arduino</b></span>&mdash;and allow quick, easy
transportation of files between hardware, without a lot of messing about with
file ownership, special permissions or anything like that. The assumption would
be that the user had full ownership of everything, which, for regular users, is
almost always the case.
</p><p>
There was a lot of initial resistance, because <span   class="bold"><b>FAT32</b></span> traditionally has been the
filesystem used on such drives. But FAT32 has a file size limit, and Dan had hit
that limit with an Arduino project and wrote LanyFS partly to overcome that.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, <span   class="bold"><b>exFAT</b></span> is <span   class="bold"><b>Microsoft</b></span>'s solution to the same use case. The only problem
is, as <span   class="bold"><b>Carlos Alberto Lopez Perez</b></span> put it, exFAT was encumbered by patents
and licensing fees, which put it out of the running. But, Microsoft might be
reluctant to support LanyFS, if it's pushing its own exFAT solution onto users.
</p><p>
As it turns out, <span   class="bold"><b>Arnd Bergmann</b></span> also is
working on a minimalist Flash filesystem.
Although because he was working with a third-party vendor and didn't want to mess up
the time frame, he didn't offer any details, except to say that the
filesystem would be optimized for Flash.
</p><p>
The appealingly named <span   class="bold"><b>Unified Extensible Firmware
Interface</b></span> (UEFI) probably
will be supported in the Linux kernel at some point. Its purpose is to prevent users
from having control of their own systems, so that third-party vendors can run the
show. Look it up. It's ugly.
</p><p>
A variety of technical problems are standing in the way of UEFI support.
<span   class="bold"><b>Matthew Garrett</b></span> recently posted some patches to prevent the root user from
modifying the kernel. But, <span   class="bold"><b>Alan Cox</b></span> didn't think the kernel alone could
guard against the root user successfully. After all, the foundation of Linux
security rests on the idea that once anyone gets to be root, that's the ballgame,
and so it's more important to try to prevent that from happening, than to try to
interfere with root's actions once it did.
</p><p>
I'd say UEFI almost certainly will be part of the kernel. But at the same time,
it wouldn't be enabled by default on any system other than those third-party
systems being distributed specifically in order to have UEFI enabled.
Hopefully,
it won't go too far beyond that.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: WiFi Analyzer</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #225, January 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I have a new day job, and as part of the hiring package, I was issued a
smartphone. I'm a little bitter that it doesn't include a tethering
plan, but that doesn't upset me nearly as much as the lack of Wi-Fi
analysis apps. See, my new job issued me an iPhone. I really like the
iPhone (it's true, I can't lie), but in order to scan Wi-Fi, I'd have to
jailbreak my phone!
</p><p>
Thankfully, the world of Android has no such silly limitation. If you've
ever wanted to scan for access points or check signal levels in different
parts of your house, WiFi Analyzer is an excellent (and free!) tool. WiFi
Analyzer will show currently available access points, graph signal
strength as you walk around the house, and even give information on
signal quality.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11414androidf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Screenshot from the Google Play Store
</p></div></div><p>
I've used WiFi Analyzer to determine the best placement of access points
when deploying a building-wide wireless infrastructure. I've used it to
pick the best channel for my home access points. I've even walked down
the road with it to see what my neighbors use as SSIDs. (That last one
might be a little creepy, but really, if people name their wireless
networks after Teletubbies, you want to keep an eye on them.)
</p><p>
Because it's incredibly useful, completely free and not available on iOS,
WiFi Analyzer gets this month's Editors' Choice award. Check it out at

If you're a developer, you've no doubt heard of the SCRUM project
development method. In fact, it's very likely you use it. If you're
tired of sticky notes on a whiteboard, however, you might want to check
out ScrumBoard.

ScrumBoard is an open-source Windows application that provides a digital
whiteboard for manipulating project tasks. Tasks can be created, moved
and reassigned all inside a completely digital environment. Some people
benefit from a physical, visual look at project tasks, but for 
others, the convenience of a portable digital version is perfect. If
you're a SCRUM user, and you're stuck on Windows, check out ScrumBoard:

<h2 class="title">Gnuplot&mdash;the Grandfather of Graphing Utilities</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #225, January 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In these columns, I have covered several different scientific packages for
doing calculations in many different areas of research. I also have 
looked at various packages that handle graphical representation
of these calculations. But, one package that I've never looked at
before is gnuplot (<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info" target="_self">www.gnuplot.info</a>). Gnuplot has been around since
the mid-1980s, making it one of the oldest graphical plotting programs
around. Because it has been around so long, it's been ported to most
of the operating systems that you might conceivably use. This month,
I take a look at the basics of gnuplot and show different ways to use it.
</p><p>
Gnuplot is a command-line-driven program. As such,
it has been co-opted to provide graphic capabilities in several other
applications, such as octave. Thus, you may have used gnuplot without even
realizing you were doing so. You can use gnuplot in several ways. 
It not only can accept input data to plot, but it also can
plot functions. Gnuplot can send its output either to the screen
(in both a static file format display or an interactive display), or
it can send output to any of a large number of file formats. 
Additionally, lots of functions are available to customize your plots, changing the
labels and axes, among other things.
</p><p>
Let's start by installing gnuplot. Binaries are available for
many different operating systems. Most Linux distributions also should 
come with a package for gnuplot, so installation should be a breeze. If
you want the latest and greatest features available, you always
can download the source code and build gnuplot from scratch. 
</p><p>
Once gnuplot is
installed, you can start it by executing the command
<tt  >gnuplot</tt>. When
executed this way, you are launched into an interactive session. Let's
start by trying to plot a basic function. You should be able to plot
any mathematical function that would be accepted in C, FORTRAN or
BASIC. These mathematical expressions can be built up from built-in
functions like <tt  >abs(x)</tt>, <tt  >cos(x)</tt>
or <tt  >Bessel</tt>. You can use integer,
real and complex data types as arguments to these functions. 
</p><p>
When using
gnuplot to generate a plot, you either can have all of the commands in
a single file and hand them in to gnuplot as a script, or you can start
gnuplot up in interactive mode and issue these commands one at a time in
the command environment. To run a gnuplot script, you simply need to add
it at the end of the command when you run gnuplot&mdash;for example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
gnuplot script_to_run
</pre>
</p><p>
When you run gnuplot in interactive mode, you can quit your session
with the command <tt  >quit</tt>. The two most basic commands
are <tt  >plot</tt> and
<tt  >splot</tt>. <tt  >plot</tt> generates
two-dimensional plots, and <tt  >splot</tt> generates
three-dimensional plots. To plot a simple function, you can use:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plot sin(x)/x
</pre>
</p><p>
This generates a plot window, displaying the graphical results (Figure 1).
If you want to add a title to the plot, you can add this
option to the plot command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plot sin(x)/x title "Example 1"
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11414gnuplotf1.large.jpg"><img src="11414gnuplotf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Plotting commands open a new window for display.
</p></div></div><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11414gnuplotf2.large.jpg"><img src="11414gnuplotf2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. A Basic Plot of <tt >sin(x)/x</tt>
</p></div></div><p>
You even can plot multiple expressions on the same plot window with:

   
<pre     class="programlisting">
plot sin(x)/x title "Example 1", sin(x) title "Example 2"
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11414gnuplotf3.large.jpg"><img src="11414gnuplotf3.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 3. You can plot multiple functions on the same graph.
</p></div></div><p>
To plot a three-dimensional graph, simply hand in an expression with two
independent variables to <tt  >splot</tt>, such as:

<pre     class="programlisting">
splot x**2+y**2
</pre>
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11414gnuplotf4.large.jpg"><img src="11414gnuplotf4.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 4. Gnuplot even can handle 3-D plots.
</p></div></div><p>
If you run into a problem, the first place to look is the built-in help
function. To get help with the <tt  >plot</tt> command, execute the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
help plot
</pre>
</p><p>
This pulls up the help documentation that gnuplot has regarding the
<tt  >plot</tt> command.
</p><p>
This is fine if you are just trying to see what some expression looks like
when it is plotted out, but in real science, you often collect data in
experiments that need to be plotted so you can do some graphical
analysis and get ideas as to what may be happening. Gnuplot can
handle this type of plotting too. To do so, you simply need to hand in
the filename of the file containing the data to be plotted. This file
should have the data elements arranged in columns, where the columns are
separated by white space of some kind. Any lines that start with #
are treated as comments by gnuplot and are ignored. If your data file
contains several data columns, you can select which columns are pulled in
to be plotted as options to the plot or splot functions. As an example,
say you have a data file that has the temperature and pressure
for each day. You can plot the temperature with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
plot "weather.dat" using 1:2 title "Temperature"
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to get the pressure graph, you would use:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
plot "weather.dat" using 1:3 title "Pressure"
</pre>
</p><p>
If you want to plot all three columns, you can use:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
splot "weather.dat"
</pre>
</p><p>
There are two ways of customizing your plots when using gnuplot. The first
is to use options to the <tt  >plot</tt> and
<tt  >splot</tt> commands. In this case, you define
things like the title of the plot, the axes or the style. The styles
available can be lines, points, linespoints, impulses, dots, steps,
fsteps, histeps, errorbars, xerrorbars, yerrorbars or xyerrorbars. To use
one of the styles, you can include the option with the
<tt  >with</tt> keyword. So,
if you want to plot both the lines and points of your graph, you could
add <tt  >with linespoints</tt> to your
<tt  >plot</tt> command. You also can use shortcuts
for these options. For <tt  >with</tt>, you can use
<tt  >w</tt>. For the <tt  >title</tt> option,
you can use <tt  >t</tt>. For the <tt  >using</tt>
option shown earlier, you can use
<tt  >u</tt>. 
</p><p>
The second option for customizing your plots is to use the
<tt  >set</tt>
command. With this command, you are free to set the values for several
graphing options. Using the second option, you can set all types of
options, like the title, xlabel, yrange, xtics or key, among other
options. For example, you can set the y-range with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set yrange [20:500]
</pre>
</p><p>
After setting the various plotting options, you need to tell gnuplot
to redraw the plot you are working on. You can do this with the
command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
replot
</pre>
</p><p>
Many of these <tt  >set</tt> options also use shortcuts. For example, the shortcut
version of the above command is:

<pre     class="programlisting">
set yr [20:500]
</pre>
</p><p>
Gnuplot is not only a capable utility to plot data and functions,
but it also can do some analysis on the data being plotted. For example,
you can get gnuplot to do curve fitting on the data. To do so, you 
first need to define a function, as well as some initial guesses before
calling the <tt  >fit</tt> command. An example would look like
this:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
f1=a1*tanh(x/b1)
a1=300; b1=0.005;
fit f1(x) 'data_file.dat' using 1:2 via a1,b1
</pre>
</p><p>
This tells gnuplot to try to fit the data from the columns 1 and
2 from the file data_file.dat to the function defined by
<tt  >f1(x)</tt>.
</p><p>
When you have an environment created for a particular research area, you
can save all of the settings you may have set up with the command
<tt  >save</tt>. This command essentially saves off all of the gnuplot
commands you issued to the text file. This text file can be
loaded into a new gnuplot session with the <tt  >load</tt> command. This will
take all of the commands saved to the &ldquo;save&rdquo; file and re-run them in
the new session. 
</p><p>
You always can see what options have been set by using
the command <tt  >show</tt>. This command shows you what values have been set
within the current session. To see all of the options, use the
command <tt  >show all</tt>. When you are playing with options, you sometimes
can get yourself into an odd condition. Just remember that you always
can reset any values created with the <tt  >set</tt> by using
the <tt  >reset</tt> command. This
command resets these session options to their default values.
</p><p>
Sometimes you may need to interact with the system on which gnuplot is
running. In those cases, you need to start a shell session from
gnuplot. There are two ways to do so. The first is to use the command
<tt  >system</tt>. In this case, you can hand in a string containing the system
commands that need to be run outside of gnuplot. The other option is
to use the command <tt  >!</tt>. This command actually is just a shortcut for
the command <tt  >system</tt>, and the commands can be used interchangeably.
</p><p>
This article has covered only the most basic functions available in
gnuplot. It's definitely worth your time to look deeper into the
documentation to see what else it can do for you in analyzing your
data. Even if you don't use gnuplot directly, learning more about it will
help you when you use other applications like octave. Take this article
as a jumping-off point and explore just what is possible in data analysis.

<h2 class="title">Native(ish) Netflix!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #225, January 2013</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
The folks over at <a href="http://www.iheartubuntu.com" target="_self">www.iheartubuntu.com</a> recently put up a challenge to
the Linux community to get Netflix to work natively under our beloved
OS. Thankfully, Erich Hoover stepped up to the challenge and patched
the Wine Project in a way to allow Firefox/Silverlight to be installed
and actually work with Netflix's DRM'd Silverlight!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11414netflixf1.large.jpg"><img src="11414netflixf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>

</p></div></div><p>
The process is a little complex, and it involves patching source code before
compiling, but Erich plans to create a PPA with all the compiling already
done. Eventually, he intends to create a standalone Netflix-playing app
that incorporates all the pieces of Wine and Silverlight. Thankfully,
Erich didn't wait until the project was complete before sharing his
success. If you want to play native(ish) Netflix on your Linux desktop
without virtualization, check out his instructions at:

I'm often compared to the Absent-Minded Professor. I take it as a
great compliment, because in the movie, he's brilliant. Unfortunately,
when people refer to me as him, it's the &ldquo;absent-minded&rdquo; part they're
stressing&mdash;not the &ldquo;professor&rdquo; part.
</p><p>
During the past few years, I've written about task-management systems,
&ldquo;get things done&rdquo; digital tools and ways to keep track of to-do lists in
Linux. This month, I'm sharing Wunderlist, which is a cross-platform
task-management and sharing utility that is truly amazing. When I say
cross-platform, I really mean it too. Wunderlist works in Windows, OS X,
Linux, iOS, Android, Blackberry, the Web and probably another half-dozen interfaces I've yet to encounter.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11414wunderf1.large.jpg"><img src="11414wunderf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Although it has a robust feature set including task list sharing, due dates,
task notes, the ability to drag tasks between lists and keep track of completed
items, for me, its real value is in its simplicity. Wunderlist doesn't
try to do too much; it just does task lists really, really well. If
you haven't seen Wunderlist in action before, put it on your list
today: <a href="http://www.wunderlist.com" target="_self">www.wunderlist.com</a>.
