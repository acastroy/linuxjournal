Infrastructure, like geology, is temporary. Both work on a LIFO basis.
Dunes built by surf and wind are the first landforms to go when the weather
gets wild&mdash;likewise human constructions, such as beach houses and
boardwalks. As I write this, on Halloween 2012, the dunes and boardwalks of
the Jersey Shore, where I spent my summers as a kid, have been torn apart
and deposited inland by Superstorm (n&eacute;e Hurricane) Sandy, which came
ashore two nights ago. A broken gas line feeds a fire that already
has burned ten houses in Mantoloking. Nearly every clear summer day, from 1949
to 1961, when I was age 2 to 14, we'd go to Mantoloking Beach. That's
where I learned to swim and ride the surf. Since then, Mantoloking has
become an upscale enclave. From what I can tell, all the houses that just
burned were put up since I knew the place. Last in, first out.
</p><p>
Infrastructure is the geology we make and re-make for ourselves. Across
eastern Massachusetts, where I am now, bike paths have replaced railroads
that replaced the tow paths of canals that replaced paths of animals and
other natives through the woods. Construction is the world's oldest and
biggest business. Much of that work is re-construction. There is no urge
more human, Stewart Brand once said, than the urge to alter a permanent
structure. Using natural and manufactured materials, we build and re-build,
constantly. On the island of Majorca, which is one big piece of marine
limestone, it is said that every building block has been lifted by a
thousand hands a thousand times. A single block holding up an olive terrace
also may have served time in pavement, a lookout tower and the wall of a
house. How that works also is a good model for code. A few years ago, on a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> Geek Cruise (I still miss those), I asked Andrew Morton if
hackers would still be improving the Linux kernel 200 years from
now. He said yes. To me, that makes Linux a form of infrastructure.
Something of its nature is geological. That is, its purposes transcend the
temporary, and even the specific. It's made for wide usability more than
for any specific use. &ldquo;I don't know what happens outside the kernel, and I
don't much care&rdquo;, Linus says (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6427" target="_self">www.linuxjournal.com/article/6427</a>). &ldquo;What happens inside the kernel I care
about.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Given the nature of human attention, it's amazing that infrastructure gets
made at all. Even for hackers, attention tends to be partial and
provisional, and always subject to rot. The sentences we hear verbatim are
forgotten within seconds, leaving only meaning behind&mdash;and partial
meaning at that. Each cycle of human life runs about a century at best. If
we're lucky, we might get 60 productive years. Within those years, one's
lasting effects are so rare that others treasure them. My own favorite
treasure is the George Washington Bridge, which my father helped build, as
a cable rigger (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/3503894401" target="_self">www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/3503894401</a>). He's long gone,
but his work is not. Yet, it too shall pass.
The purpose of the bridge&mdash;to carry traffic in and out of New
York&mdash;surely will outlive all of us, but it is unlikely to outlast the
geology in which it is anchored. On the New York side, the rock is
Manhattan Schist
(<a href="http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/000457.html" target="_self">www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/000457.html</a>),
formed in the Cambrian, about a half-billion years ago.
On the New Jersey side, it's the Palisades
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palisades_(Hudson_River)" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palisades_(Hudson_River)</a>): cliffs that began as an
intrusive sill at the end of the Triassic, a little more than 200 million years
ago. That's when Pangea began to break up. If you want to see the adjacent
geologies of that time, visit the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.
</p><p>
On the stellar scale, the rock flanking the Hudson is young. The solar
system is 4.65 billion years old; the universe about 2.8 times older than
that. Conveniently, the first half-dozen billion years of matter's
existence were enough time to populate most of the periodic table. This
required compressing light elements into stars and exploding those stars,
over and over, scattering the building materials of new stars and planets
in all directions. Most heavy elements involved in Earth's creation sank
early to the core. The ones found in Earth's crust&mdash;gold, titanium and
tungsten, for example&mdash;were deposited by meteorites
(<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091018141608.htm" target="_self">www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/10/091018141608.htm</a>) after the surface
hardened. Surely much of it came during the same Heavy Bombardment
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment</a>) that put
a face on the moon, during a 300-million-year span, starting 4.1 billion
years ago. More than 90% of the iron mined so far on Earth was
deposited as ferrous sludge on ocean floors a little more than two billion years
ago, when life began to bloom and metabolize out the iron then saturated in
the seas. This was an event that will not be repeated. If our species'
appetite for iron persists long enough, we'll re-mine it from landfills
after exhausting its supply in ancient rock. Helium, the second-lightest
element and one of the most common in the universe, is currently produced
on Earth only by decay of a certain breed of natural gas. At the current
usage rate, helium is due to run out in a few dozen years
(<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/11/AR2010101104496.html" target="_self">www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/11/AR2010101104496.html</a>).
As yet, we have
no other way to make it, but that doesn't stop us from using it up, just as
we use up other non-renewable things, deferring the problem of resource
exhaustion to future generations. We are, undeniably, a pestilential
species.
</p><p>
Our summer home was about ten miles inland from Mantoloking, in Brick
Township, on the edge of the Pine Barrens
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Barrens_(New_Jersey)" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Barrens_(New_Jersey)</a>). My parents had an acre and a
half there, which they bought in 1948 for $150. Pop and Uncle Archie, his
brother-in-law, cut a driveway to a clearing and brought in a small old
shack on a flat-bed truck, which they deposited on a shallow foundation of
cinder blocks. They named it The Wanigan, a native term for a portable
abode. They drove a well by hand, pounding lengths of galvanized steel pipe
down into the ground. Their driver was a capped iron pipe half filled with
lead, weighing about 80 pounds. They fit this over the top of the well
pipe, then lifted and dropped it, over and over again. After they got water
flowing with a hand pump, they built a kitchen around the pump and then a
one-hole privy in the back. A few years later Pop added a bedroom, dug a
septic tank and built a small indoor bathroom. Electricity arrived early
on, but telephony never did. Grandma and other relatives bought adjacent
properties, and put up their own little houses. I still remember every foot
of the paths between them. For my sister and me, plus countless cousins, it
was paradise. The forest floor was a thick mass of blueberries,
huckleberries and wintergreen, under a canopy of scrub oak and pitch pine.
Clearings and paths were established by deer and other woodland creatures.
We went barefoot all summer, running from one secret place to another,
grazing on berries like sheep on grass, and riding our bikes to the country
store to buy candy and comic books, which we read and re-read on our bunk
beds. Bedtime came when the whip-poor-will called
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Whip-poor-will" target="_self">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Whip-poor-will</a>), and we fell asleep to a
hubbub of crickets and tree frogs.
</p><p>
The LIFO geology under The Wanigan was sand deposited in the Pliocene, when
the whole coast was under water. The sand was easy to dig up, which we
often did, to make castles, forts and other structures. Our hands and feet
would always turn black when we did. Pop told us this was because countless
wildfires destroyed the forest over and over, turning the sand gray with
ash. Later, when I looked more deeply into the matter, I found he was
right. In fact, the whole forest ecosystem was adapted to fire. Also,
apparently, to suburban sprawl, since the Wanigan, Grandma's place and
nearly everything around it is now a strip mall.
</p><p>
The main influence on my life in those days was my cousin Ron, who was five
years older than me and much more hip to what mattered in the world, such
as girls, cars and rock &amp; roll. I was too shy and geeky to recruit a
girlfriend and wasn't old enough to drive, but I could sublimate my
yearnings through music. My main source for that was WMCA, then New York's
main Top 40 station. I loved to gawk at WMCA's transmitter when we passed
it on the New Jersey Turnpike, on our way down to The Shore (pronounced
&ldquo;Da
Shaw&rdquo;). I saw WMCA's three-tower rig as the well from which all cool music
came.
</p><p>
It was from this that I became obsessed with the mysteries of wireless. Why
did some AM stations have one tower while others had more? Why did AM
signals fade under bridges wile FM ones didn't? What made signals at the
bottom end of the AM band travel farther along the ground than those at the
top end? What made the ionosphere reflective of AM and shortwave signals
but not of FM and TV signals? Why did TV work best with a roof antenna
while AM radio didn't?
</p><p>
At age 12, I got a ham radio license and began to build electronic
stuff, sometimes on advice from engineers I met at the transmitters of New
York's AM stations, nearly all of which stood, like WMCA's, in stinky
swamps along the Hackensack and Passaic Rivers. I'd ride my bike down there
from our house in Maywood, knocking on doors of transmitter buildings, and
then asking questions of the engineers while they took readings off meters,
threw big scary switches and whacked vegetation away from the bases of
towers. At night I'd &ldquo;DX&rdquo;&mdash;listening to far-away
stations&mdash;on my
Hammarlund HQ-129X ham receiver, which did a great job picking up AM
signals, mostly through my 40-meter dipole antenna, which hung like a
clothesline between my bedroom and a tree in our backyard. By the time we
moved away from Maywood, I had logged about 800 stations, or about 10% of
all the stations transmitting in the US at that time. Later, as an adult
in North Carolina, I did the same with FM signals, which occasionally
refract at a low angle, like a mirage above a hot road, off the same
ionospheric layer that reflects AM signals, bringing in clear signals from
800 to 1,000 miles away. The thrill of this was less in signal fishing than
in gaining an empirical understanding of how things work.
</p><p>
It was because of that understanding that I blogged this two days ago,
while Sandy was headed ashore
(<a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2012/10/29/riding-out-the-storm" target="_self">blogs.law.harvard.edu/doc/2012/10/29/riding-out-the-storm</a>):
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
Given the direction of the storm, and the concentrating effects of the
coastlines toward their convergence points, I would be very surprised if
this doesn't put some or all of the following under at least some water:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
All three major airports: JFK, La Guardia and Newark.
</p></li><li><p>
The New York Container Terminal.
</p></li><li><p>
The tower bases of New York's AM radio stations. Most of them transmit from
the New Jersey Meadows, because AM transmission works best on the most
conductive ground, which is salt water. On AM, the whole tower radiates.
That's why a station with its base under water won't stay on the air. At
risk: WMCA/570, WSNR/620, WOR/710, WNYC-AM/820, WINS/1010, WEPN/1050,
WBBR/1130, WLIB/1190, WADO/1280 and several others farther up the band.
WFAN/660 and WCBS/880 share a tower on High Island in Long Island Sound by
City Island, and I think are far enough above sea level. WMCA and WNYC
share a three-tower rig standing in water next to Belleville Pike by the
New Jersey Turnpike and will be the first at risk.
</p></li></ul></div></blockquote></div><p>
I got most of that right. Two of the three airports took water, and WMCA,
WNYC, WINS, WLIB and some number of other stations went off the air when
the tide surge rose over their transmission equipment and tower bases. The
main reason I called them right is that I've been studying infrastructure
in various ways ever since Ron turned me on to rock &amp; roll. It also
has occurred to me gradually, during the decade and a half I've been writing
here, that my interest in Linux and infrastructure are of a single piece
with my interest in geography, aerial photography and fault lines where
the converging forces of business, hackery and policy meet. In the parlance
of geologists, much of what happens amidst all of it is &ldquo;not well
understood&rdquo;.
</p><p>
According to the <span   class="emphasis"><em>Oxford English Dictionary</em></span>, the word
<span   class="emphasis"><em>infrastructure</em></span> first
appeared in the early 1900s
(<a href="http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/infrastructure" target="_self">oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/infrastructure</a>).
According to Google's Ngram Viewer
(<a href="http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=infrastructure&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3%E2%86%A6share=" target="_self">books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=infrastructure&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&#8614;share=</a>), which
graphs usage of words in books across time,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>infrastructure</em></span> did not
hockey-stick until the 1960s. Relatively speaking, academic work on
infrastructure is sparse. There are few university departments devoted to
infrastructure. (The University of Melbourne's Department of Infrastructure
Engineering is one: <a href="http://www.ie.unimelb.edu.au" target="_self">www.ie.unimelb.edu.au</a>). It's more of a topic in many fields than a field of
study itself. I have come to believe this is a problem. If we'd had a
better understanding of infrastructure, we might have suffered fewer losses
from Katrina, Sandy and other natural disasters. We might also have a
better understanding of why it's nuts to build on barrier dunes, fault
lines and places nature likes to burn every few dozen years&mdash;unless
the inevitability of loss is a conscious part of our deal with nature.
Likewise, I believe we'd have a better understanding of human inventions
with vast positive externalities, such as those produced by Linux and the
Internet, if we also understood their leverage as the same as that provided
by infrastructure.
</p><p>
Without that understanding, it's hard to make full sense of modern
oddities,
such as Google's giant data centers. A few days ago, as I write this,
Google took the wraps off of what had been, until then, largely a secret
matter. Now it's bragging on the giant, nameless buildings that
together comprise, Google says, &ldquo;where the Internet lives&rdquo;. Google does its
best to pretty up these places with gorgeous photos and copy like, &ldquo;Steam
rises above the cooling towers in The Dalles data center in Oregon. These
plumes of water vapor create a quiet mist at dusk.&rdquo; Still, they look like
prisons (<a href="http://www.google.com/about/datacenters/gallery/#/places" target="_self">www.google.com/about/datacenters/gallery/#/places</a>)&mdash;or
data-fired power plants, which is basically what they are.
</p><p>
Think about it. These places are no less central to what civilization does
today than are power plants and container ports. Yet there is little if any
regulatory oversight of them, outside concerns over power use and
environmental impact. Nor could there be. Knowledge of what the Internet
is, and how it works, is minimal to most of those who use it, and worse
than absent in legislative and regulatory circles, both of which have long
since been captured by Hollywood and the phone and cable companies. Because
of this, the Net is slowly turning into a &ldquo;service&rdquo; through which Hollywood
and the carriers can bill us in fine detail for &ldquo;content&rdquo; and data usage.
And, because of this, we risk diminishing or losing the most productive
generator of positive economic externalities the world has ever known.
Google is both at war and allied with these forces, and that war is being
played out inside these data centers. I believe we'd understand all of this
a lot better if we also had a better understanding of what infrastructure
is, and what it does.
</p><p>
Sometime soon I'll re-start work on <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Giant Zero</em></span>: my book about
infrastructure and the Internet, and how the two overlap. The title comes
from a description of the Net as &ldquo;a hollow sphere in which every point is
visible to every other point across an empty space in the middle&mdash;a
vacuum where the virtual distances are zero&rdquo;. That insight is Craig
Burton's, and he provided it in an interview I did for a <span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux
Journal</em></span>
piece in the mid-1990s. Learnings from Linux will be at the core of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Giant
Zero</em></span>. Anybody interested in helping build the prose base for that work,
please get in touch. I can't, and won't, build it alone.
