Creating a multiplayer game can be a lot of fun, but navigating the
complexities of IP network programming can be a headache. That's kind of a
strange statement, but the two go hand in hand. You can't write a
multiplayer game without some sort of network-based communications, and
game-related network programming introduces difficulties not often found
with more simple applications. For example, most game developers are
concerned with bandwidth utilization and throttling. There's also player
session management to contend with. Then, there's the problem of message
fragmentation, acknowledgement and sequencing. Oh, and you'd really like to
be able to make your game run on both Linux and Windows. That's a tall
order for developers who probably are more concerned with writing their games
than they are in becoming experts in cross-platform network programming.
Fortunately, the ENet library (<a href="http://enet.bespin.org" target="_self">enet.bespin.org</a>) takes care of these
details and presents developers with a simple, flexible and consistent
API.
</p><p>
ENet's event-driven programming model makes client session management very
simple. The library dispatches an event when a peer connects or
disconnects, and when a message is received from a peer. The developer
simply writes event handlers that take care of initializing and
deallocating resources, and acting upon incoming messages. This means you
don't have to worry about the complexities of forking, preforking,
threading or nonblocking calls to connect() and accept() in order to
handle multiple connections. With ENet, all you do is make periodic calls
to its event dispatcher and handle the events as they come in.
</p><p>
ENet provides for both reliable and unreliable transmission. The
networking industry really needs to find a better term than
&ldquo;unreliable&rdquo;, however. Unreliable means that a
packet will be sent out, but the receiving end won't be expected to
acknowledge receiving the packet. In a &ldquo;reliable&rdquo; protocol, every
packet must be acknowledged upon receipt. If a peer sends out a packet and
requests acknowledgement and doesn't receive it in a timely fashion, the
packet will be resent automatically until it is acknowledged, or the peer
is deemed to be unreachable. The nice thing about ENet is that the same
API provides both reliable and unreliable semantics.
</p><p>
ENet also makes it easy to write real-time client-server applications by
taking care of packet fragmentation and sequencing chores for you. Put
simply, fragmentation and reassembly is done automatically and is
transparent to the developer. Sequencing also is handled transparently and
can be turned on and off at will. ENet's concept of a communications
channel is related to sequencing. ENet buffers each channel separately
and empties each buffer in numerical sequence. The end result is that you
can transmit multiple data streams and that lower-numbered channels have
higher priority. For example, you could put all real-time game update
packets into channel 1, while system status packets could be in a lower-priority channel.
</p><p>
For the sake of demonstration, I discuss both the client and
server for a simple chat program. The code I'm using is based on a 3-D
video game I'm writing in my limited free time. However, while stripping
the code down to its basics, I left something out and couldn't get it to
work. So, I posted a description of my problem and code snippets to the
ENet e-mail list. Within an hour, I had a reply that showed me how to fix
my problem. Thanks, Nuno. 
</p><p>
In this example, a user starts the client and provides a user name as a
command parameter. Once a client session has been created, the client is
expected to tell the server the name of the user, as the very first message
sent from the client. Then, anything the user types will be sent to the
server. Any messages that come from the server will be displayed on the
client's screen. Because all user input is taken in a blocking fashion, the
user won't actually see any incoming messages until pressing the Enter
key. This isn't ideal, but the point of the code is to demonstrate the
ENet library, not nonblocking I/O on STDIN and the necessary cursor
control. (In a real-world situation, your programs would be generating
messages, such as player movement and projectile impact, in real time
anyway.) If the user simply presses the Enter key, no message is sent to
the server, but any queued-up messages will be displayed. If the user
types the letter q and presses Enter, the client disconnects and
terminates.
</p><p>
The server also is very simple. When a client connects, the server waits
for the client to identify the user. Then, the server sends a broadcast
message announcing the new user's connections. When a client disconnects,
that fact also is broadcast to all connected users. When a client
sends a message, that message is sent to every connected client, except the
one who sent it. Like I said, it's a very simple chat system.
</p><p>
Let's look at some code.
First, let's get a few #defines out of the way. Take a
look at config.h shown in Listing 1.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1158580.0x1250828"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Listing 1. config.h</b></p><pre     class="programlisting">
#define HOST "localhost"
#define PORT (7000)
#define BUFFERSIZE (1000)
</pre></div><p>
This is pretty straightforward, so let's look at the client code shown in
Listing 2.

71    enet_deinitialize();
72  }

</pre></div><p>
Lines 1&ndash;17 are boilerplate. Note that on line 3, I include
enet/enet.h
and not simply enet.h. The ENet documentation indicates that enet.h may
conflict on some systems, so the enet directory must be used. The global
buffer defined on line 6 is where I will put user input. Lines 7&ndash;11
simply define some variables that the ENet library requires.
</p><p>
The real ENet code begins on line 18 with the call to enet_initialize().
Once the library is initialized, I create the client host on line 22. As
you'll see, clients and servers are both created with a call to
enet_host_create(). The only difference is that for a client, you send NULL
as the first argument. For a server, this argument tells ENet what address
to bind to. Because a client doesn't have to bind, you pass in NULL. The
second argument sets the limit on how many connections to make room for.
This example client will connect only to one server, so I pass in 1. These two
arguments are the only differences between creating a client and a server!
</p><p>
The third argument indicates how many channels I expect to use, 0-indexed
by the way. Finally, the last two arguments indicate bandwidth limitations
in bits per second for upload and download, respectively. Of course, I
check to see if the call to enet_host_create() was successful and continue.
</p><p>
Lines 27&ndash;33 tell the client what address and port the server
is on and to try to connect to it. If the client can't connect, it will
terminate.
</p><p>
If the program gets to line 34, it has connected to the server, and it's
time to identify the user. The enet_host_service() function is ENet's
event dispatcher, but this will be made more clear in the server code. For
now, understand that all I'm doing is waiting for the server to confirm
the connection so you can identify yourselves. If you don't see the
ENET_EVENT_TYPE_CONNECT, you know you didn't really get connected and 
should terminate. On lines 38&ndash;41, I create and send a packet to the
server that simply contains the user's name. (I'll have more to say about
packets when I examine the server code.)
</p><p>
The rest of the program, from line 46, is the main event loop. (I'll
discuss enet_host_service() and the switch statement that follows it in
more detail when I discuss the server.) The code starting from line 58 is
fairly simple. Here I get input from the user and check if it's an empty
line or if it's a line with just a q on it. Otherwise, I create a
packet and send it. Obviously, I never really get to line 71, but I
included it for instructional purposes.
</p><p>
The client really isn't very difficult to write and understand. As you're
about to see, the server code is almost identical. Let's take a look at
the server code in Listing 3.

62    }

63    enet_host_destroy(server);
64    enet_deinitialize();
65  }

</pre></div><p>
As you can see, the first 24 lines of code are almost identical to those
found in the client code, with two notable exceptions. On lines
17&ndash;19, I
tell the server to bind to the default IP address, 0.0.0.0, and allocate
space for up to 100 client connections. In this case, I don't set any
limits on bandwidth utilization.
</p><p>
On line 25, I call enet_host_service() until it returns 0. Each time
enet_host_service() returns a nonzero value, I know that something has
happened, and the switch statement that follows is used to determine what
happened. Note the third argument indicates how many milliseconds to wait
for something to happen. If I had passed a 0 in this argument, the call
to enet_host_service() would be completely nonblocking.
</p><p>
The ENET_EVENT_TYPE_CONNECT event indicates that a client has connected to
the server. Normally, you'd want to initialize resources for the client.
But in this case, there is nothing to do until the client has identified
itself. I left this case intact for instructional purposes.
</p><p>
The ENET_EVENT_TYPE_RECEIVE event is dispatched when the server receives a
message from a client. For this event, there are two possible scenarios:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>
The client hasn't identified itself yet, and this is the first message
I've received from them.
</p></li><li><p>
The client has been identified, and this is a normal chat message.
</p></li></ol></div><p>
I check to see which is the case in the conditional on line 30. This line
also points out an issue that comes up in the forums from time to time, so
I'll explain it in a bit more detail.
</p><p>
Most server applications have to store at least some information about each
client. Typically, they use an array of structures to store this
information. Intuition tells you that one of the things you should store in a
given client's structure is a pointer to whatever data type allows you to
communicate with it. But with ENet, that intuition is wrong. Instead,
ENet's peer data type provides a field, data, that you can use to store a
pointer. This pointer presumably would point to the client's information
structure. So, it's almost backward from what you expect. But, this is kind
of an elegant solution; ENet manages its data, and you manage yours,
separately.
</p><p>
The only client data that you care about is the name of the user associated
with a given client. If you don't already have the user's name, and you
receive a message from his or her client, you can assume that the client is
identifying itself to you and you should store the user's name. I do this
in lines 31 and 32. Then, in lines 33&ndash;36, I announce the new user to the
rest of the clients. Note that I create a packet on line 34, but the call
to enet_host_broadcast() deallocates it. It is a major error to deallocate
that data structure yourself.
</p><p>
In lines 37&ndash;49, you can see the case where the client already is identified.
All you have to do is send a message to the other clients indicating the
name of the &ldquo;speaker&rdquo; and what he or she &ldquo;said&rdquo;.
To do this, you
loop over ENet's list of peers. For each peer, check to see if it's the
same peer that sent the message. If it is, you skip it, as people really
don't want their own messages echoed back to them. Otherwise, you create a
message and send it. This way, each client knows what was said, and by
whom.
</p><p>
The ENET_EVENT_TYPE_DISCONNECT event indicates that a client has
disconnected. In this case, you announce that the user has disconnected and
deallocate the space used to store the user's name. On line 55, I set the data
pointer back to NULL just in case ENet decides to re-use this structure when
another client connects.
</p><p>
If no event is received, the default case is executed, and the server simply
prints &ldquo;Tick tock&rdquo; to the console, as a reassurance that it is
still running.
</p><p>
And, there you have it&mdash;a chat client in 72 lines of code and a multi-user
chat server in 65 lines of code, and much of the code was
identical. In
fact, in the program upon which this code is based, I actually use identical code
for both the client and server. Rather than have a block of code in the
switch statement, I simply call an event handler, which is implemented in a
separate code module, one for the client and one for the server. Then,
depending on which module I link against, I can have a client or a server.
This has the added benefit of isolating all of the ENet-specific code in
one source file.
</p><p>
As you can see, the ENet library is almost trivial to use, but it encapsulates
sophisticated network communications capabilities. Of course, what this
really means is that it's just fun to use.
