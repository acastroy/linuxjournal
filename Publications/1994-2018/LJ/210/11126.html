Roll your own image inclusion utility.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d64580.0x1e5c358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
As an old-school tech guy, I can appreciate all the shiny new widgets we have
on our computer applications, but I still usually prefer a command line and
being able to fine-tune exactly what's produced rather than just hope
it'll work. This is particularly true when it comes to HTML generators
and Web page creation tools. 
</p><p>
You need only look at the output of Microsoft Word's &ldquo;Save as
HTML&rdquo; feature to know what I mean. (All right, that's not a fair
comparison because it's so bloody ghastly that even the Microsoft people
avoid using Word for this purpose.)
</p><p>
It's fair to call me a prolific writer too, and much of what I write is
for the on-line world. This gives me the chance to compare different tools, and
since I'm &lt;cough&gt; a bit of a perfectionist &lt;cough&gt;, it also lets me see
which content creation tools allow fine-tuning and which trap you in the
world their developers have created. 
</p><p>
In particular, I'm thinking of WordPress, a super-popular open-source
blogging utility, versus Movable Type, a more closed development tool that is
unfortunately a bit in limbo due to a change in corporate ownership. My main
blog, Ask Dave Taylor.com, operates on Movable Type (as does the Huffington
Post, among others), whereas the film reviews I write for ScienceFiction.com
come through its WordPress system. 
</p><p>
WordPress makes it complicated to add images to your articles, and when it
does, I find that I invariably switch into the HTML source and tweak the code
produced. If nothing else, there's always insufficient padding between
the image and the text adjacent, which is something I often puzzle
about&mdash;how I
can be the only person who notices?
</p><p>
Movable Type could have the same issues, but because it doesn't have such
a fancy HTML edit widget, it instead has encouraged me to roll my own image
inclusion utility, and that's what we're going to examine this month. 
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d64580.0x1e5c778"></a>
scale.sh</h2></div></div><p>
The purpose of the utility is to take an image, either in GIF, JPEG or PNG
format, calculate its size and produce the HTML necessary to have it
properly included in a blog post. To make it more useful, it can
automatically scale the image dimensions in the HTML, add image borders if
needed and even add captions as specified. 
Here's a simple example of it at work: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
$ scale 1 ../Desktop/test-image.png  
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.askdavetaylor.com/blog-pics/
&#8618;test-image.png"
alt="test image" border="0" width="256" height="384" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt; 
</pre>
</p><p>
It has lots of smarts, including the knowledge to convert the local image into an
equivalent URL that instead references the archive layout on my server,
calculates height and width, and even includes an ALT attribute
(which is good SEO juju) based on the name of the file. 
</p><p>
The <tt  >1</tt> in the command invocation says that I want the image to be at
its full size (scale=100%). To make it smaller, say 75%, I could invoke it as
<tt  >scale 0.75</tt>, and if I wanted to constrain it by a specific pixel
width, perhaps because of a page layout issue, I can do that too with
<tt  >scale 200</tt>.
</p><p>
The two most important lines in the script are those that invoke the terrific
ImageMagick command-line utility <tt  >identify</tt> and parse the image
dimensions: 

  
<pre     class="programlisting">
width="$(identify $filename | cut -f3 -d\  | cut -f1 -dx)"
height="$(identify $filename | cut -f3 -d\  | cut -f2 -dx)" 
</pre>
</p><p>
Extract a multiplier based on the starting parameter, and it's then
straightforward to use <tt  >bc</tt> and get the new dimensions: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
width="$(echo "$width * $multiplier" | bc | cut -d. -f1)"
height="$(echo "$height * $multiplier" | bc | cut -d. -f1)" 
</pre>
</p><p>
To understand this, imagine we're using the original image with its
256x384 dimensions. If we constrain it to a max of 200 pixels in width, the
multiplier can be calculated as:


<pre     class="programlisting">
multiplier="0$(echo "scale=2 ; $maxwidth / $width" | bc)" 
</pre>
</p><p>
Or, if we want to do the math ourselves, 200/256 = 0.78. Calculate both
dimensions by that figure and we arrive at the scaled-down image size of
200x300. 
</p><p>
If the user specifies a percentile multiplier, say 0.75 for a 25% reduction
in image size, then the math is even easier because, we don't have to
calculate the multiplier. It already has been specified by the user: 0.75.
The resultant image: 192x288.
Not rocket science, but darn helpful.

The Search Engine Impact of Scaled Images</h2></div></div><p>
The problem that creeps up here is one that's tied more to search engine
optimization and so-called SERP, search engine results placement. In a
nutshell, slow-loading pages now are penalized in the search results, and if
you're loading up lots of large images and then automatically scaling
them down with the attributes in your HTML code, you're hurting your page
and its ability to rank well in user searches&mdash;not good.  
</p><p>
If it's a 10% shrinkage or you're just shaving off a few pixels to
make it fit a particular page design (for example, I keep my images to 500
pixels or narrower on my DaveOnFilm.com site), no worries. At that point, the
difference in file size is usually negligible.  
</p><p>
This brings us to another important task that scale.sh performs:
testing and warning if you're going to be scaling an image down to the
point where you can experience an SERP penalty. Here's how that's
calculated: 


<pre     class="programlisting">
sizediff=$(echo "scale=3; ( $width / $owidth ) * 100" |
   bc | cut -d. -f1) 
</pre>
</p><p>
<tt  >owidth</tt> is the original width, so in the case where we constrained
the image to 200 pixels, we'd have the mathematical formula:

<pre     class="programlisting">
sizediff=( 200 / 256) * 100 
</pre>
</p><p>
The <tt  >cut -d. -f1</tt> is the equivalent of the
&ldquo;floor&rdquo;
mathematical function; it just converts a float back into an integer. 
</p><p>
Do the math, and sizediff = 78. That sounds right based on what we calculated
earlier with the multiplier. I've set an arbitrary limit so that anything
that's more than a 20% reduction in size is worthy of generating a
warning message, like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
if [ $sizediff -lt 80 ] ; then
  echo "*** Warning: $filename scaled to $sizediff%"
  echo ""
fi 
</pre>
</p><p>
Sure enough, if we run <tt  >scale.sh</tt> with the 200-pixel width
constraint, here's what we see: 
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
*** Warning: ../Desktop/test-image.png scaled to 77% 
</pre>
</p><p>
In my next article, I'll dig farther into the script and describe some of the tricks
I'm using to generate the best, smartest HTML code I can manage. In
the meantime, think about how you are adding images to your own on-line
content and whether your method is optimized for both the user experience and the
search engines.
