Last month, I started to explore how to figure out what words we could make from
a set of letter cubes, based on a letter that a reader sent me. If you think about
the problem, however, you realize that it has more general applicability in games
like <span   class="emphasis"><em>Scrabble</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Words with Friends</em></span>
too: &ldquo;Here's a set of letters, some
possibly repeating, what words can I make with them?&rdquo;
</p><p>
Of course, in games where there are interlocking words, there's always a spare
letter or two that you're working with above and beyond what's on your
rack or in your hand, but the same basic principle holds true, right?
In my last article, we ascertained that the fast way to identify possible word candidates for a set of
letters was through a rather tricky regular expression:
  
<pre     class="programlisting">
^[word]{length}$
</pre>
</p><p>
You'll doubtless recall that ^ is the special character that matches
the very beginning of the line, and $ is the one that matches the last
character. In a regular expression (or &ldquo;regex&rdquo; as we old-timers call
them), anything with a {} notation is a repeat count, so what we're
basically looking for here are words that are composed exclusively of the letters
in the [] notated set that are {} characters long.
</p><p>
In practice, <tt  >^[chicken]{7}$</tt> matches the word chicken
(of course), along with any
other seven-letter words that can be spelled by using just those letters&mdash;which turns
out to be &ldquo;chicken&rdquo;. So, that wasn't a great demo. But, let's say we
remove the trailing character, allowing matching words that include all the
letters but are longer than just seven characters. Now the results are a smidgen more
interesting:

<pre     class="programlisting">
checking
chicken
chickens
chinning
</pre>
</p><p>
You can see that they don't work simply by length, but the first has a
&ldquo;g&rdquo; that we don't have in the original set, the third an
&ldquo;s&rdquo;,
and the last has one &ldquo;n&rdquo; more than the original pattern included. 
</p><p>
That's why this is a two-step solution!
</p><p>
Let's capture this first portion in code before we proceed, however, keeping
in mind that we can simplify the expression by removing duplicate characters (so
&ldquo;chicken&rdquo; can become &ldquo;chiken&rdquo;). Here's my code snippet:

<pre     class="programlisting">

length="$(echo "$1" | wc -c)"
length=$(( $length - 1 ))

unique="$(echo $1 | sed 's/./&amp;\
/g' | tr '[[:upper:]]' '[[:lower:]]' | sort | \
uniq | fmt | tr -C -d '[[:alpha:]]')"

regex="^[$unique]{$length}"

echo "Raw word list of matches for letterset $unique:"

grep -E $regex "$dictionary"

</pre>
</p><p>
As you immediately can see, the real work of the script is in removing duplicate
letters from the word pattern&mdash;a rather crazy-complicated pipe that works like
this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
echo user specified pattern |
  append a carriage return to each individual letter |
  translate uppercase to lowercase |
  sort the letters alphabetically |
  remove duplicates with "uniq" |
  merge the multiple lines to a single line with "fmt" |
  remove any non-alphabetic characters with "tr"
</pre>
</p><p>
That's a lot of work, but it's a tricky task. We need to explode the word
so it's all separate letters, process those letters, then reassemble the word
afterward.
</p><p>
In this case, running this with our word of &ldquo;chicken&rdquo; (but with the
trailing $ still missing) produces:

<pre     class="programlisting">
Raw word list of matches for letterset cehikn:
checking
chicken
chickens
chinning
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice the alphabetically sorted, dupe-removed &ldquo;cehikn&rdquo; in the prompt.
</p><p>
So we don't forget, let's go back into the code and change the pattern assembly line
to include the $:

<pre     class="programlisting">
regex="^[$unique]{$length}$"
</pre>
</p><p>
But first....
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ca580.0x23c3068"></a>
Back to Those Letter Blocks</h2></div></div><p>
The thing about everything we've written so far is that it assumes we want to
use every single letter every time we run the program, and that might not be a
valid assumption. For example, perhaps a four-letter word out of five blocks is an
acceptable solution, with the spare block put aside for that particular day.
</p><p>
To match that scenario, a single comma will do the work as long as the length
parameter in the regular expression indicates the minimum acceptable
length. In
other words, instead of something like <tt  >[chicken]{7}</tt>, use a pattern like
this: <tt  >[chicken]{5,}</tt>.
</p><p>
The good news? This provides a lot more matches:


<pre     class="programlisting">
Raw word list of 5 or longer matches for letterset cehikn: 
check
cheek
chick
chicken
chink
hence
niche
niece
</pre>
</p><p>
What I did in the code was change the length calculation always to calculate two
less than the actual length&mdash;really the only change needed:

<pre     class="programlisting">
minlength=$(( $length - 3 )) 
</pre>
</p><p>
Well, I guess I tweaked the echo statement too:

<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "Raw word list of $minlength or longer matches \
   for letterset $unique:"
</pre>
</p><p>
Still, that's not much of a change and a big boost to the number of possible words that
match the given set of characters!
</p><p>
But which actually can be assembled without needing duplicates of letters that
aren't available?
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x22ca580.0x23c35e8"></a>
Making Sure We Use Only the Available Letters</h2></div></div><p>
My first thought on solving this problem involved sorting the letters in the words
and comparing, but that works only if the two words are the same length. Consider
the pattern &ldquo;cats&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;cast&rdquo;. Sort them by letter and
they're the same: &ldquo;acst&rdquo;. Easy. 
</p><p>
But can you spell &ldquo;chick&rdquo; with the letters in &ldquo;chicken&rdquo;? Can you
spell &ldquo;cheek&rdquo;? Yes, and no. 
</p><p>
The smarter way to manage the process is through a &ldquo;picking&rdquo; algorithm
where the program goes through each letter of the input pattern (for example, the letters
on the blocks) and checks against the potential match. Each time a letter is
matched, it's removed. This then makes it easy to identify the situation where
there are letters that are used too often, as the double &ldquo;e&rdquo; of
&ldquo;cheek&rdquo; above demonstrates.
</p><p>
If there are letters that aren't axed in the potential word by the time all
the letters of the pattern are exhausted, that's a fail too (representing a
letter that doesn't appear in the input set), but that already should be
caught earlier in the program when we are screening against our letter set. 
</p><p>
In other words, the word &ldquo;cheek&rdquo; can't be made out of
&ldquo;chicken&rdquo;, but neither can &ldquo;chicky&rdquo;: there's no
&ldquo;y&rdquo;.
But that situation will have been identified in the first half of the program
anyway, and the word would never have made it into the test list at this point.
</p><p>
Still, a bit of analysis shows that it's not really a big deal because
the algorithm remains the same: start with the test word and the pattern. For each
letter in the pattern, remove that letter from the test word if present. When
done, the test word should be consumed entirely by the substitution process and no
letters should remain standing.
</p><p>
If it meets the minimum length requirement (because &ldquo;hi&rdquo; shouldn't be
a good match for the letter set &ldquo;chicken&rdquo;) and has no remaining letters,
it's a win! We've found another word that can be made from the letters of
the pattern.
</p><p>
And coding it? That's next month. Stay tuned.
