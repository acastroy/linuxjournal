Ever get stuck on a strange and untrusted network? Use your RPi to get
around that!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b9580.0x29b11f8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Like many <span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> readers these days, I've been leading a bit of a
techno-nomadic lifestyle as of the past few years&mdash;jumping from network
to network, access point to access point, as I bounce around the real
world while maintaining my connection to the Internet and other networks I
use on a daily basis. As of late, I've found that more and more networks
are starting to block outbound ports like SMTP (port 25), SSH (port 22)
and others. It becomes really frustrating when you drop into a local
coffee house expecting to be able to fire up your SSH client and
get a few things done, and you can't, because the network's blocking you.
</p><p>
However, I have yet to run across a network that blocks HTTPS outbound
(port 443). After a bit of fiddling with a Raspberry Pi 2 I have at home,
I was able to get a nice clean solution that lets me hit various services
on the Raspberry Pi via port 443&mdash;allowing me to walk around blocked
ports and hobbled networks so I can do the things I need to do. In a
nutshell, I have set up this Raspberry Pi to act as an OpenVPN endpoint,
SSH endpoint and Apache server&mdash;with all these services listening on
port 443 so networks with restrictive policies aren't an issue.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b9580.0x29b14b8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Notes</b></p><p>
This solution will work on most networks, but firewalls
that do deep packet inspection on outbound traffic still can block
traffic that's tunneled using this method. However, I haven't been on a
network that does that...yet. Also, while I use a lot
of cryptography-based solutions here (OpenVPN, HTTPS, SSH), I haven't
done a strict security audit of this setup. DNS may leak information,
for example, and there may be other things I haven't thought of. I'm not
recommending this as a way to hide all your traffic&mdash;I just use this
so that I can connect to the Internet in an unfettered way when I'm out
and about.

Getting Started</h2></div></div><p>
Let's start off with what you need to put this solution together. I'm
using this on a Raspberry Pi 2 at home, running the latest Raspbian,
but this should work just fine on a Raspberry Pi Model B, as well.
It fits within the 512MB of RAM footprint quite easily, although performance
may be a bit slower, because the Raspberry Pi Model B has a single-core
CPU as opposed to the Pi 2's quad-core. My Raspberry Pi 2 is behind
my home's router/firewall, so I get the added benefit of being able
to access my machines at home. This also means that any traffic I send
to the Internet appears to come from my home router's IP address, so
this isn't a solution designed to protect anonymity. If you don't have a
Raspberry Pi, or don't want this running out of your home, it's entirely
possible to run this out of a small cloud server too. Just make sure
that the server's running Debian or Ubuntu, as these instructions are
targeted at Debian-based distributions.

Installing and Configuring BIND</h2></div></div><p>
Once you have your platform up and running&mdash;whether it's a Raspberry
Pi or otherwise&mdash;next you're going to install BIND, the nameserver that
powers a lot of the Internet. You're going to install BIND as a caching
nameserver only, and not have it service incoming requests from the
Internet. Installing BIND will give you a DNS server to point your OpenVPN
clients at, once you get to the OpenVPN step. Installing BIND is easy;
it's just a simple <tt  >apt-get</tt> command to install it:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@test:~# apt-get install bind9
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree

The following extra packages will be installed:

 &#8618;0 not upgraded.
Need to get 490 kB of archives.
After this operation, 1,128 kB of additional disk 
 &#8618;space will be used.
Do you want to continue [Y/n]? y
</pre>
</p><p>
There are a couple minor configuration changes that need
to be made to one of the config files of BIND before it can
operate as a caching nameserver. Both changes are in
/etc/bind/named.conf.options. First, you're going to uncomment the
&ldquo;forwarders&rdquo; section of this file, and you're going to add a nameserver
on the Internet to which to forward requests. In this case, I'm going to add
Google's DNS (8.8.8.8). The &ldquo;forwarders&rdquo; section of the file should look
like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
forwarders {
    8.8.8.8;
};
</pre>
</p><p>
The second change you're going to make allows queries from your internal
network and localhost. Simply add this line to the bottom of the
configuration file, right before the <tt  >};</tt> that ends the file:

<pre     class="programlisting">
allow-query { 192.168.1.0/24; 127.0.0.0/16; };
</pre>
</p><p>
That line above allows this DNS server to be queried from the network it's
on (in this case, my network behind my firewall) and localhost. Next,
you just need to restart BIND:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@test:~# /etc/init.d/bind9 restart
[....] Stopping domain name service...: bind9waiting 
 &#8618;for pid 13209 to die
. ok
[ ok ] Starting domain name service...: bind9.
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can test <tt  >nslookup</tt> to make sure your server works:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@test:~# nslookup
&gt; server localhost
Default server: localhost
Address: 127.0.0.1#53
&gt; www.google.com
Server:		localhost
Address:	127.0.0.1#53
	
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	www.google.com
Address: 173.194.33.176
Name:	www.google.com
Address: 173.194.33.177
Name:	www.google.com
Address: 173.194.33.178
Name:	www.google.com
Address: 173.194.33.179
Name:	www.google.com
Address: 173.194.33.180
</pre>
</p><p>
That's it! You've got a working nameserver on this machine. Next, let's
move on to OpenVPN.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b9580.0x29b1fb8"></a>
Installing and Configuring OpenVPN</h2></div></div><p>
OpenVPN is an open-source VPN solution that relies on SSL/TLS for
its key exchange. It's also easy to install and get working under
Linux. Configuration of OpenVPN can be a bit daunting, but you're not
going to deviate from the default configuration by much. To start,
you're going to run an <tt  >apt-get</tt> command and install OpenVPN:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@test:~# apt-get install openvpn
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
The following extra packages will be installed:
  liblzo2-2 libpkcs11-helper1

 &#8618;0 not upgraded.
Need to get 621 kB of archives.
After this operation, 1,489 kB of additional disk 
 &#8618;space will be used.
Do you want to continue [Y/n]? y
</pre>
</p><p>
Now that OpenVPN is installed, you're going to configure it. OpenVPN is
SSL-based, and it relies on both server and client certificates to work.
To generate these certificates, you need to configure a Certificate
Authority (CA) on the machine. Luckily, OpenVPN ships with some wrapper scripts
known as &ldquo;easy-rsa&rdquo; that help to bootstrap this process. You'll start by
making a directory on the filesystem for the easy-rsa scripts to reside
in and by copying the scripts from the template directory there:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@test:~# mkdir /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
root@test:~# cp -rpv 
 &#8618;/usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0/* 
 &#8618;/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, copy the vars file to a backup copy:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@test:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa# cp vars vars.bak
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, edit vars so it's got information pertinent to your
installation. I'm going specify only the lines that need to be edited,
with sample data, below:

<pre     class="programlisting">
KEY_SIZE=4096
KEY_COUNTRY="US"
KEY_PROVINCE="CA"
KEY_CITY="Silicon Valley"
KEY_ORG="Linux Journal"
KEY_EMAIL="bill.info@linuxjournal.com"
</pre>
</p><p>
The next step is to source the vars file, so that the environment
variables in the file are in your current environment:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@test:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa# source ./vars
NOTE: If you run ./clean-all, I will be doing a 
 &#8618;rm -rf on /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
</pre>

Building the Certificate Authority</h2></div></div><p>
You're now going to run <tt  >clean-all</tt> to ensure a clean working environment,
and then you're going to build the CA. Note that I'm
changing <tt  >changeme</tt> prompts to something that's appropriate for this
installation:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@test:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa# ./clean-all
root@test:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa# ./build-ca

The next step may take a while&mdash;building the Diffie-Hellman key for the
OpenVPN server. This takes several minutes on a conventional desktop-grade
CPU, but on the ARM processor of the Raspberry Pi, it can take much,
much longer. Have patience, as long as the dots in the terminal are
proceeding, the system is building its Diffie-Hellman key (note that many
dots are snipped in these examples):

<pre     class="programlisting">

Building the Client Certificate</h2></div></div><p>
Now you're going to generate a client key for your client to use when
logging in to the OpenVPN server. OpenVPN is typically configured for
certificate-based auth, where the client presents a certificate that
was issued by an approved Certificate Authority:

<pre     class="programlisting">

Now you're going to generate an HMAC code as a shared key to 
increase the security of the system further:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@test:~# openvpn --genkey --secret 
 &#8618;/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys/ta.key
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x28b9580.0x29b2b10"></a>
Configuration of the Server</h2></div></div><p>
Finally, you're going to get to the meat of configuring the OpenVPN
server. You're going to create a new file, /etc/openvpn/server.conf, and
you're going to stick to a default configuration for the most part. The
main change you're going to do is to set up OpenVPN to use TCP rather than
UDP. This is needed for the next major step to work&mdash;without OpenVPN
using TCP for its network communication, you can't get things working
on port 443. So, create a new file called /etc/openvpn/server.conf,
and put the following configuration in it:


<pre     class="programlisting">
port 1194
proto tcp
dev tun
ca easy-rsa/keys/ca.crt
cert easy-rsa/keys/test.linuxjournal.com.crt ## or whatever 
 &#8618;your hostname was
key easy-rsa/keys/test.linuxjournal.com.key  ## Hostname key 
 &#8618;- This file should be kept secret
management localhost 7505
dh easy-rsa/keys/dh4096.pem
tls-auth /etc/openvpn/certs/ta.key 0
server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0 # The server will use this 
 &#8618;subnet for clients connecting to it
ifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt
push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp" # Forces clients 
 &#8618;to redirect all traffic through the VPN
push "dhcp-option DNS 192.168.1.1" # Tells the client to 
 &#8618;use the DNS server at 192.168.1.1 for DNS - 
 &#8618;replace with the IP address of the OpenVPN 
 &#8618;machine and clients will use the BIND 
 &#8618;server setup earlier
keepalive 30 240
comp-lzo # Enable compression
persist-key
persist-tun
status openvpn-status.log
verb 3
</pre>
</p><p>
And last, you're going to enable IP forwarding on the server, configure
OpenVPN to start on boot and start the OpenVPN service:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@test:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys# echo 
 &#8618;"net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.conf

 &#8618;/etc/sysctl.conf

net.core.rmem_max = 12582912
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 10240 87380 12582912
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 10240 87380 12582912
net.core.wmem_max = 12582912

Setting Up OpenVPN Clients</h2></div></div><p>
Your client installation depends on the host OS of your client, but you'll
need to copy your client certs and keys created above to your client, and
you'll need to import those certificates and create a configuration for
that client. Each client and client OS does it slightly differently and
documenting each one is beyond the scope of this article, so you'll need
to refer to the documentation for that client to get it running. Refer
to the Resources section for OpenVPN clients for each major OS.

Installing SSLH&mdash;the &ldquo;Magic&rdquo; Protocol Multiplexer</h2></div></div><p>
The really interesting piece of this solution is SSLH. SSLH is a protocol
multiplexer&mdash;it listens on port 443 for traffic, and then it can analyze
whether the incoming packet is an SSH packet, HTTPS or OpenVPN, and it
can forward that packet onto the proper service. This is what enables
this solution to bypass most port blocks&mdash;you use the HTTPS port for
all of this traffic, since HTTPS is rarely blocked.
</p><p>
To start, <tt  >apt-get install</tt> SSLH:

After SSLH is installed, the package installer will ask you if you want
to run it in inetd or standalone mode. Select standalone mode, because you want
SSLH to run as its own process. If you don't have Apache installed, the
Debian/Raspbian package of SSLH will pull it in automatically, although it's
not strictly required. If you already have Apache running and configured,
you'll want to make sure it <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> listens on localhost's interface and not
all interfaces (otherwise, SSLH can't start because it can't bind to port
443). After installation, you'll receive an error that looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
[....] Starting ssl/ssh multiplexer: sslhsslh disabled, 
 &#8618;please adjust the configuration to your needs
[FAIL] and then set RUN to 'yes' in /etc/default/sslh 
 &#8618;to enable it. ... failed!
failed!
</pre>
</p><p>
This isn't an error, exactly&mdash;it's just SSLH telling you that it's
not configured and can't start. Configuring SSLH is pretty simple. Its
configuration is stored in /etc/default/sslh, and you just need to
configure the <tt  >RUN</tt> and
<tt  >DAEMON_OPTS</tt> variables. My SSLH configuration looks
like this:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# Default options for sslh initscript
# sourced by /etc/init.d/sslh
	
# Disabled by default, to force yourself
# to read the configuration:
# - /usr/share/doc/sslh/README.Debian (quick start)
# - /usr/share/doc/sslh/README, at "Configuration" section
# - sslh(8) via "man sslh" for more configuration details.
# Once configuration ready, you *must* set RUN to yes here
# and try to start sslh (standalone mode only)
	
RUN=yes

# binary to use: forked (sslh) or single-thread 
 &#8618;(sslh-select) version
DAEMON=/usr/sbin/sslh
	
DAEMON_OPTS="--user sslh --listen 0.0.0.0:443 --ssh 
 &#8618;127.0.0.1:22 --ssl 127.0.0.1:443 --openvpn 
 &#8618;127.0.0.1:1194 --pidfile /var/run/sslh/sslh.pid"
</pre>
</p><p>
Save the file and start SSLH:
	
<pre     class="programlisting">
root@test:/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys# 
 &#8618;/etc/init.d/sslh start
[ ok ] Starting ssl/ssh multiplexer: sslh.
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, you should be able to <tt  >ssh</tt> to port 443 on your
Raspberry Pi, and have it forward via SSLH:
	
<pre     class="programlisting">
$ ssh -p 443 root@test.linuxjournal.com
root@test:~#
</pre>
</p><p>
SSLH is now listening on port 443 and can direct traffic to SSH, Apache
or OpenVPN based on the type of packet that hits it. You should be ready
to go!

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
Now you can fire up OpenVPN and set your OpenVPN client configuration
to port 443, and SSLH will route it to the OpenVPN server on port 1194.
But because you're talking to your server on port 443, your VPN
traffic won't get blocked. Now you can land at a strange coffee shop,
in a strange town, and know that your Internet will just work when you
fire up your OpenVPN and point it at your Raspberry Pi. You'll also
gain some encryption on your link, which will improve the privacy of
your connection. Enjoy surfing the Net via your new landing point!
