<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #258, October 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
Over time, memory can become more and more fragmented on a system,
making it difficult to find contiguous blocks of RAM to satisfy ongoing
allocation requests. At certain times the running system may compact
regions of memory together to free up larger blocks, but <span   class="bold"><b>Vlastimil
Babka</b></span> recently pointed out that this wasn't done regularly enough to
avoid latency problems for code that made larger memory requests.
</p><p>
Vlastimil wanted to create a new per-CPU d&aelig;mon, called <span   class="bold"><b>kcompactd</b></span>,
that would do memory compaction as an ongoing system activity.
</p><p>
The basic objection, voiced by <span   class="bold"><b>David
Rientjes</b></span>, was that creating a
whole new thread on all CPUs carried its own overhead issues. He suggested
having one of the other per-CPU threads simply take on the additional
memory compaction responsibilities. He identified the <span   class="bold"><b>khugepaged</b></span> d&aelig;mon
as the best candidate.
</p><p>
Vlastimil actually had identified khugepaged as a candidate and rejected
it, on the grounds that khugepage dealt only with <span   class="bold"><b>THP</b></span> (Transparent
HugePages) memory use cases. These are an abstraction layer above regular
memory allocation, so it wouldn't cover all possible cases, only
user code that dealt with THPs.
</p><p>
David argued that THP allocations were where most compaction problems
occurred, and that other allocation systems, like the <span   class="bold"><b>SLUB</b></span> allocator (used
for highly efficient kernel allocations), were not part of the problem.
</p><p>
Eventually, it came out that David actually envisioned two forms of memory
compaction. The first would be a periodic compaction effort that would
happen regardless of the state of RAM. The second would be a compaction
effort that would be triggered when particular regions of RAM were
detected as being overly fragmented. By splitting these two forms of
memory compaction from each other, David felt it would be possible
to piggy-back various pieces of functionality onto different existing
threads and avoid having to create a new per-CPU thread in the kernel.
</p><p>
A final design did not get hashed out during the discussion, but no one
seemed to be saying that memory compaction itself was a bad goal. The
question always was how to implement it. <span   class="bold"><b>Mel
Gorman</b></span> even suggested that
a fair bit of the work could be done from user space, via the <span   class="bold"><b>SysFS</b></span>
interface. But, that idea wasn't explored during the discussion, so
it seems that only technical obstacles could get in the way of some
background memory compaction going into the kernel.
</p><p>
One problem with enabling the <span   class="bold"><b>CONFIG_TRACING</b></span> option in the kernel,
as <span   class="bold"><b>Tal Shorer</b></span> recently pointed out, is that it would enable absolutely
every tracepoint, causing a significant performance penalty. It made
more sense, he felt, to allow users to enable tracepoints on just the
subsystems they were interested in testing.
</p><p>
He posted a patch to do this. Or rather, he posted a patch to ditch
the old system and allow users to enable tracepoints on only the <span   class="bold"><b>GPIO
subsystem</b></span>. He picked GPIO, he said, as a test case. If it met with
approval, he offered to submit patches for all the rest of the subsystems.
</p><p>
Because of the overall kernel development cycle, it took a couple weeks
for his patches to make the rounds. The new merge window had opened,
so folks like <span   class="bold"><b>Steven Rostedt</b></span>, who
ordinarily would be the one looking
over Tal's submission, were too busy for any new code, until after the
merge window had closed again.
</p><p>
Once that was ironed out though, he seemed to have mostly positive
feedback for Tal. It looks as though tracepoints soon will be
per subsystem, rather than kernel-wide.
</p><p>
In order to allow non-root users to write good system monitoring software,
<span   class="bold"><b>Prarit Bhargava</b></span> wanted to expose the
<span   class="bold"><b>MSR</b></span> values to non-root users, on
a read-only basis. MSR registers are an <span   class="bold"><b>Intel</b></span>-specific set of registers
that Intel originally intended for its own debugging purposes and made
no guarantees that future chipsets would provide the same values. But
over time, those registers seem to have coalesced around debugging
and monitoring features, and the Linux kernel does expose them to the
root user.
</p><p>
Prarit felt that allowing read-only access would avoid any potential
security issues, because users would be unable to mess around with the
actual values of those registers. But as other folks pointed out, the
dangers of the MSR registers also existed in the kernel objects and regions
of memory they exposed. Even read-only access could be sufficient
for a hostile user to gain enough information to attack a
running system successfully.
</p><p>
So, working with <span   class="bold"><b>Andy Lutomirski</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>Pavel Machek</b></span>, Prarit wrote a
<span   class="bold"><b>PMU</b></span> (Performance Monitoring Unit) driver that would expose only a
specifically whitelisted set of MSR data to users. This way, they could
write their system monitoring software without risking a new attack,
and if Intel changed the MSR registers in future chips, the changes would
need to be vetted and the whitelist would need to be updated before any
of that altered data would be exposed to regular users.
</p><p>
As an example of the importance of this particular issue, <span   class="bold"><b>Len Brown</b></span>
mentioned during the discussion that <span   class="bold"><b>Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory</b></span> was keenly interested in the design and outcome of Prarit's
efforts. The folks there wanted a secure and efficient way to access those MSR
registers, and this work would provide it.

<h2 class="title">Android Candy: Who Ya Gonna Call? Anyone!</h2>

I have a love/hate relationship with the contact manager on my phone. I
absolutely love having all of that information available, and I love even more
that it syncs with my Google contacts. What I don't love, however,
is the cumbersome way you have to scroll around looking for who you
want to call. Yes, I normally just look at my recent calls to find who
I want, but it seems like there should be a better way to look
at my contacts.
</p><p>
Enter Drupe. It feels a bit like a mix between a game and a standardized
test's matching exercise. That might sound like an odd comparison, but
Drupe makes it easy not only just to call, but also to communicate with contacts with
a simple drag. Want to call Mom? Drag her face to the phone icon. Want
to text your significant other? Drag his or her face to the SMS icon.
(Okay,
maybe &ldquo;drag her face&rdquo; sounds a bit violent.)

(Screenshot from <a href="http://getdrupe.com" target="_self">getdrupe.com</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
If you like a graphical, easy way to start communicating with your
contacts, I urge you to give Drupe a try. It's completely free, supports
a huge number of protocols, and it even offers free themes so you can change
the way it looks.

<h2 class="title">Non-Linux FOSS: Code Your Way To Victory!</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #258, October 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
One of my favorite things about grade school was when the teacher would
review for a test by playing <span   class="emphasis"><em>Jeopardy</em></span>. I'm pretty old, so my version
of classroom <span   class="emphasis"><em>Jeopardy</em></span> was done on a chalkboard with the teacher reading
answers from index cards, but the new computer-based versions I see in
schools are at least as cool. There's just something about learning
while playing games that is awesome.
</p><p>
Learning to write code is a chore that often is considered boring. Heck,
the only way I'm able to slog through the process is to have a project
in mind. I need to be solving a problem in order to find the motivation
to write the code, and learning the &ldquo;tools&rdquo; really becomes part of the
enjoyment. Thankfully, I'm not alone in my desire to tie learning into fun. The
folks over at CodeCombat have created a gaming system that uses
proper coding techniques to help your hero solve a quest.
</p><p>
The &ldquo;game&rdquo; actually feels like a cross between <span   class="emphasis"><em>The
Incredible Machine</em></span>
(or <span   class="emphasis"><em>Crayon Physics</em></span> if you're too old to remember
<span   class="emphasis"><em>TIM</em></span>), and the old LOGOS
turtle we guided around the screen in the 1980s and 1990s. Some of the
gaming elements seem like a stretch (magic boots give you the ability
to write code that moves your character), but the goofiness adds to the
fun a bit. Plus, the graphics are really well done, and the background
music rocks.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11917fossf1.large.jpg"><img src="11917fossf1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
CodeCombat is free to use, and it includes 100 or so coding exercises. If
you're really into the game and want to improve your coding skills
further, there is a $9.99/month subscription that opens up video
tutorials, more levels and so on. There's even a price break if you buy
multiple subscriptions for those little coders in your life.
</p><p>
Even though the game itself isn't FOSS, and actually runs in a Web browser
instead of a particular platform, I put Code Combat in our Non-Linux FOSS
spot this month because it teaches code. Teaching people to write code
is the first step in creating a FOSS world, and for that reason, I also
award Code Combat this month's Editors' Choice Award. Check it out today,
and see if it's a good fit for you or other potential coders in your life:

<h2 class="title">Science on Android</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #258, October 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I have covered a lot of different scientific packages that are
available under Linux in this space, but the focus has been on Linux running on desktop
machines. This has been rather short-sighted, however, as lots of
other platforms have Linux available and shouldn't be neglected.
So in this article, I start looking at the type of science you can do
on the Android platform. For my next several articles, I plan to include 
occasional Android applications that you may find useful.
</p><p>
The first application I want to explore
is Maxima for Android (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/maximaonandroid" target="_self">https://sites.google.com/site/maximaonandroid</a>). 
Maxima has been under development since the 1960s at MIT,
and it continues to this day under an open-source license. It is a full
computer algebra system, written in Common Lisp. Luckily, Embeddable
Common Lisp has been ported to Android, so this provides the Lisp engine
needed to run the Maxima engine. 
</p><p>
Installing Maxima on your
Android device is a two-step process. The first step is to install the
base application from the Google Play store. Once it is installed and
you run it for the first time, the application will unpack the bulk of
the application. Because this section is so large, the app will ask you
where to unpack it, so you can put it on some other media if
you don't have a lot of room in internal storage.
</p><p>
When you initially start Maxima, you get a display of the licensing
information and the version number, and then you are presented with an input
prompt labeled as &ldquo;(%i1)&rdquo;. Depending on the device you
are using and the age of your eyes, you may have a hard time seeing the
output displayed on the screen. If so, you can zoom in and out with
a two-finger pinch or zoom, just like in other Android applications. Your
other option is actually to change the font size. You can use
the command <tt  >textSize:XX</tt>, where XX is the size you want to use for the
font in pixels. The suggested range is 10&ndash;50 pixels. 
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11917maxf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. When you start Maxima, you get the standard license and version information.
</p></div></div><p>
At
the bottom of the screen, you will find a text entry box outlined
in orange. This is where you enter the Maxima commands you want to
run. Once you have entered your command and press Enter, it is displayed
in the main window, along with the results. 
The MathJax library handles the pretty-print display of
this mathematical information.
The history mechanism used in order to re-use previous commands is very
intuitive. When you tap a previous command, it is copied and pasted
into the text input command box, ready for you to make any necessary
edits before executing it again.
</p><p>
The Android version of Maxima includes a full set of documentation that
is available by tapping on the menu icon and selecting the &ldquo;Manual&rdquo;
option. A lot of examples are available in each section of the
manual that you may want to try. Assuming that this would be a common
thing people would want to do, you simply can tap the example you want
to work with, which will copy the example into the command text input
box. This way you can find an example that is close to what you want to
try to do and easily copy it into the command box. You then can edit it
and make any required changes before running it. This really can speed
up any research work you are trying to do with Maxima. 
</p><p>
There is also a
function named <tt  >example()</tt>. If you call
<tt  >example</tt> without any
parameters, it will generate a list of all of the subjects that have
examples provided. You then can look at the examples for a specific
subject by calling <tt  >example</tt> with the named subject.
For instance, you can
learn about arrays with the command <tt  >example(arrays)</tt>. This will pull
up and run a series of examples on how to use arrays within Maxima. 
</p><p>
The
other useful function for speeding up research is the ability to load
files of Maxima commands. Maxima for Android automatically looks in
the main Download directory when you try to load files. Also, files
with the &ldquo;.txt&rdquo; filename ending are found and loaded without having to
include the file ending. This means if you have a file
named &ldquo;my_script.txt&rdquo; in the Download directory, you can load it with
the command <tt  >load(my_script)</tt>. If you use Dropbox and synchronize the
Download directory, you easily can move files back and forth between
your Android device and your desktop.
</p><p>
One major area that is not completely implemented yet is the graphical
system for plots and graphs. However, new features are being added
with each new version. The graphical functions actually are provided by
gnuplot. The functions currently implemented are <tt  >plot2d</tt>,
<tt  >plot3d</tt>,
<tt  >implicit_plot</tt>, <tt  >contour_plot</tt>,
<tt  >draw</tt>, <tt  >draw2d</tt> and
<tt  >draw3d</tt>. These commands
pop open a new window to display the results of the <tt  >plot</tt>
command.
</p><p>
Because
everything is full screen on Android, you need to tap on the back
icon to get back to the main Maxima window. If you want to see the
plot again, you can tap on the menu and select the &ldquo;Graph&rdquo; option. This
will re-open the last plotting window. 
</p><p>
Another major issue is the lapack
library. Trying to load it will cause an error, so you won't have access
to the optimized linear algebra functions provided through lapack.
</p><p>
When you are doing complicated research, you may need to stop part way
through the process and pick it up again at a later time. This is handled
by the concept of a session. Tapping the menu icon, you can select the
&ldquo;Session&rdquo; option. This will pop open a sub-menu where you can choose
either to &ldquo;Save&rdquo;, &ldquo;Restore&rdquo; or &ldquo;Playback&rdquo; your session. You have
just one saved session state at a time, however, so it is really useful
only when you need to stop in the middle of a workflow. 
</p><p>
If you are working
on a larger project where you are using the same libraries for
an extended period of time, you can set initialization code that gets
run whenever Maxima starts. This code needs to be stored in the file
/data/local/tmp/maxima-init.mac. Any arbitrary Maxima code can be placed
here, so you can initialize a pretty complicated environment if you like.
</p><p>
Now you can carry Maxima around in your pocket, ready to work out all
of those troublesome problems that come up in everyday life. So, you won't
have any excuse for not solving the equations you need in order to
plot out your space travel, all on the train ride to work. Just promise
to be good, and don't try to use it on your next physics exam.

<h2 class="title">Protection, Privacy and Playoffs</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #258, October 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I'm not generally a privacy nut when it comes to my digital life. That's
not really a good thing, as I think privacy is important, but it often
can be very inconvenient. For example, if you strolled into my home office,
you'd find I don't password-protect my screensaver. Again, it's not because
I want to invite snoops, but rather it's just a pain to type in my password
every time I come back from going to get a cup of tea. (Note: when
I worked in a traditional office environment, I did lock my screen. I'm
sure working from a home office is why I'm comfortable with lax security.)
</p><p>
Somewhere I don't like to slack off on security is when I'm out and
about, especially on someone else's network. Make that a public Wi-Fi
network, and my paranoia level skyrockets. I always have a VPN set up
at home so I can connect remotely, but sometimes my home bandwidth is
just too slow for comfortable remote use. Recently I paid $39.95 for a
year subscription to <a href="http://www.privateinternetaccess.com" target="_self">www.privateinternetaccess.com</a>, and I couldn't be
any happier with my decision.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11917privf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
PIA offers PPTP, OpenVPN, L2TP/IPSec and the ability to connect up
to five devices at the same time. That means I can protect my network (I
don't really trust Charter) and connect my laptop while on the road. PIA
offers unlimited bandwidth, it doesn't log traffic, and even the account
purchasing is anonymous. You can buy your subscription with a Starbucks
gift card if you want!
</p><p>
One of my favorite features, however, is that with the option of
multiple VPN gateway locations, you can mask your traffic to get around
blackout restrictions. For me, that means I can watch Tigers baseball
games normally unavailable to me in the MLB app by routing my traffic
through the West coast. The $40 price tag seemed pretty steep at first, but with
the amount of use I've gotten out of PIA, I'll be signing up again next
year without question. You get a seven-day money-back guarantee, so there's
no reason not to try it. Visit <a href="http://www.privateinternetaccess.com" target="_self">www.privateinternetaccess.com</a>
for more details!

<h2 class="title">Roll Your Own Enterprise Wi-Fi</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Shawn Powers</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #258, October 2015</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
As you can tell by my Wi-Fi focus in The Open-Source Classroom this month,
I really love wireless networking. I've implemented wireless solutions
for schools on a shoestring budget, and I've helped plan campus-wide
rollouts of redundantly controlled enterprise solutions. The one thing
I really like about the enterprise solutions is the single point of
management. The problem is those controllers and enterprise-capable
access points are so darn expensive! That's why I love Ubiquiti.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11917unifif1.large.jpg"><img src="11917unifif1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
The UniFi line of products from Ubiquiti is affordable and reliable, but
the really awesome feature is its (free!) Web-based controller app. The
only UniFi products I have are wireless access points, even though the
company also has
added switches, gateways and even VoIP products to the mix. Even with
my limited selection of products, however, the Web controller makes
designing and maintaining a wireless network not just easy, but fun!
</p><p>
The Web controller runs happily on a little Atom Web server, and if it
happens to go off-line, the access points keep working independently. If
you'd like robust hardware with a powerful Web controller application,
but you're not ready to invest the thousands of dollars for a traditional
enterprise solution, check out the UniFi product line (<a href="https://www.ubnt.com" target="_self">https://www.ubnt.com</a>). If you're half
as nerdy as I am, you won't regret the decision!
