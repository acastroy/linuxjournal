The other evening a bunch of us were sitting in a friend's living room
while a series of photos scrolled across her TV. The photos were a screen
saver served up by her new Apple TV box. Some of the pictures were of
people, birds, flowers, cats and other typical stuff. But in the mix were
also shots of price tags, bar codes, bags of mulch and other stuff she had
thought about buying at some point.
</p><p>
&ldquo;What are those doing there?&rdquo; somebody asked.
</p><p>
&ldquo;I don't know&rdquo;, she said. &ldquo;I thought I threw those
away.&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;That's scary&rdquo;, somebody said. &ldquo;What if some of your shots were nude
selfies, or porn?&rdquo;
</p><p>
&ldquo;I don't have that&rdquo;, she replied. &ldquo;But I don't like not knowing why shots I
never intended to share are showing up on my TV.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Even though most people in the room were Apple customers, and some knew a
bit about Apple TV, the room itself had no clear sense about how Apple TV
decides what photos to show, or whether the photos on the screen come from
the user's phone, laptop or iCloud (the non-place where Apple may or may
not store some or all of what customers shoot with their cameras or
phones). So finally, a rough agreement emerged out of collective un-knowing.
</p><p>
&ldquo;It's probably the cloud&rdquo;, somebody said.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Yeah, the damn cloud&rdquo;, another agreed. What else to blame than the most
vague thing they all knew?
</p><p>
Then my wife said something that knocked me over.
</p><p>
&ldquo;The cloud has boundary issues.&rdquo;
</p><p>
Her point was about the psychology of the cloud, not its technology. In
psychology, boundary issues show up when one person doesn't respect the
boundaries set by another. And in today's networked world, personal
boundaries are ignored as a matter of course, mostly because people don't
have ways to set them.
</p><p>
In pre-Internet days, personal computers came with their own built-in
boundaries. Even when they were connected to shared printers and filesystems, it was clear where the personal stuff ended and the shared stuff
began.
</p><p>
In today's networked world, smart geeks mostly still know where local stuff
ends and remote (cloud-located) stuff begins&mdash;or at least where the
logical boundaries are. But for most of the rest of us, most of the time,
the cloud is a hazy thing. And that haze has been troubling us ever since
we chose &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; over better terms that would have made more sense.
(Such as calling it a &ldquo;utility&rdquo;, which Nicholas Carr suggested in his 2010
book <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Big Switch</em></span>.)
</p><p>
According to Google's Ngram Viewer, mentions of &ldquo;cloud computing&rdquo; in books
hockey-sticked in 2004 and continued to rise after that
Usage of &ldquo;the
cloud&rdquo; also rose over the same period. According to Google Trends, which
looks at search terms, &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; hockey-sticked in 2011 and flattened
after that, because its usage became ubiquitous.
</p><p>
William F. Buckley, Jr., once said his purpose in life was &ldquo;to stand athwart
history, yelling 'stop'&rdquo;. In a similar way, Richard M. Stallman stood
athwart history when, in September 2008, he called the cloud &ldquo;worse than
stupidity: it's a marketing hype campaign&rdquo;. &ldquo;In What Does That Server Really
Serve?&rdquo;, published in March 2010, RMS wrote:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
The information technology industry discourages users from considering ...
distinctions. That's what the buzzword &ldquo;cloud computing&rdquo; is for. This
term is so nebulous that it could refer to almost any use of the Internet.
It includes SaaS, and it includes nearly everything else. The term only
lends itself to uselessly broad statements.
</p><p>
The real meaning of &ldquo;cloud computing&rdquo; is to suggest a devil-may-care
approach towards your computing. It says, &ldquo;Don't ask questions, just
trust every business without hesitation. Don't worry about who controls
your computing or who holds your data. Don't check for a hook hidden
inside our service before you swallow it.&rdquo; In other words, &ldquo;Think like a
sucker.&rdquo; I prefer to avoid the term.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
About SaaS (Software as a Service), he adds:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
These servers wrest control from the users even more inexorably than does
proprietary software. With proprietary software, users typically get an
executable file, but not the source code. That makes it hard for
programmers to study the code that is running, so it's hard to
determine what the program really does, and hard to change it.
</p><p>
With SaaS, the users do not have even the executable file: it is on the
server, where the users can't see or touch it. Thus it is impossible
for them to ascertain what it really does, and impossible to change it.
</p><p>
Furthermore, SaaS automatically leads to harmful consequences equivalent to
the malicious features of certain proprietary software. For instance, some
proprietary programs are &ldquo;spyware&rdquo;: the program sends data about
users' computing activities to the program's owner....
</p><p>
SaaS gives the same results as spyware because it requires users to send
their data to the server. The server operator gets all the data with no
special effort, by the nature of SaaS.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
And, sure enough, spying on individuals by commercial entities is now so
normal and widespread that most of us living in the networked world can
hardly tell when it's not happening. This is why ad and tracking blockers
have become so popular, and why survey after survey shows that more than 90%
of people are concerned about privacy on-line.
</p><p>
But spying is just the symptom. The deeper issue is boundaries. In the
networked world we don't have them, and because of that, others take
advantage of us.
</p><p>
&ldquo;Give me a place to stand and I can move the world&rdquo;, Archimedes said. Note
that he didn't say, &ldquo;Give a lot of people a place to stand.&rdquo; He meant
himself. And his point applies to personal boundaries as well. Each of us
needs to set our own. That's our fulcrum.
</p><p>
Free software provides a good model for approaching this problem, because
its framing is personal:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
&ldquo;Free software&rdquo; means software that respects users' freedom and community.
Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute,
study, change and improve the software. Thus, &ldquo;free software&rdquo; is a matter
of liberty, not price....We campaign for these freedoms because everyone
deserves them.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
Most of us don't write software, but all of us create and use data. We also
have containers for data in our computers. We call those containers
<span   class="emphasis"><em>files</em></span>,
which live in <span   class="emphasis"><em>directories</em></span>, which are visualized as
<span   class="emphasis"><em>folders</em></span> in graphical
user interfaces.
</p><p>
As a mental concept, containers could hardly be more
important. In &ldquo;The
Metaphorical Structure of the Human Conceptual System&rdquo;, George Lakoff and
Mark Johnson say, &ldquo;the nature of the human conceptual system...is
fundamentally metaphorical in character&rdquo; and involves &ldquo;ontological concepts
arising in physical experience, among which is the container&rdquo;. They provide
examples: 
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
When you have a good idea, try to capture it immediately in words. Try to
pack more thought into fewer words. His words carry little meaning. Your
words seem hollow. The ideas are buried in terribly dense paragraphs. I
can't get the tune out of my mind. He's empty-headed. His brain is
packed with interesting ideas. Do I have to pound these statistics into
your head? I need to clear my head.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
All those statements presume containers: spaces with boundaries. We have
those with files, directories, folders, drives and storage systems. We
don't with clouds, beyond knowing that something resides &ldquo;in the
cloud&rdquo;. We
also don't with cookies and tracking beacons that get injected (from
clouds) into who knows where inside our computers and mobile devices. 
</p><p>
In the absence of boundaries we set, controlling entities (such as Amazon,
Apple, Facebook and Google) assume that boundary-setting is their job and
not ours, because so much of the world's work can only be done by big
systems that enjoy degrees of &ldquo;scale&rdquo; not available to individual human
beings.
</p><p>
Yet personal freedom has scale too, if it is grounded in our nature as
sovereign and independent human beings. This is why free software was such
a powerful idea in the first place, and why it remains the world's most
rigorous guide for software development. We may not always obey it, but we
always know it's there, and why it is valuable.
</p><p>
While free software respects code and what can be done with it, we need a
similar set of guiding principles that respect personal data and what can
be done with that. I believe these should be terms that we assert, and to
which others can agree, preferably automatically.
</p><p>
In fact, there is a lot of work going on right now around personal terms. I
am involved with some of it myself, through Customer Commons. Figure 1 shows one
straw-man example of terms, drawn up by Mary Hodder at the 19th Internet
Identity Workshop (IIW) last year.

</p></div></div><p>
Terms and privacy policies (that we assert, as individuals) will also be on
the table at two events this month.
</p><p>
The first is the 21st IIW, which takes place twice per year at the Computer
History Museum, in the heart of Silicon Valley. It's a three-day
unconference, with no keynotes and no panels&mdash;just breakouts on topics of
the participants' choosing. It costs money, but it's cheap compared to most
other conferences, and it's far more intense and productive than any other
conference I know. The dates are October 27&ndash;29, 2015. Register here:
<a href="http://iiwxxi-21.eventbrite.com" target="_self">iiwxxi-21.eventbrite.com</a>.
</p><p>
The second is VRM Day, which happens on October 26, 2015, the day before IIW, in
the same location. The purpose is to discuss VRM (Vendor Relationship
Management) development, which is all about freedom and independence for
individuals in the commercial world. It's free, and you can register here:
<a href="http://vrmday2015b.eventbrite.com" target="_self">vrmday2015b.eventbrite.com</a>.
</p><p>
See you there.
