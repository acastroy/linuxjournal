If terms like 802.11ac, MIMO, channel bandwidth and frequency overlap are
confusing, read on!
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185e580.0x1956358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
My family and I recently moved into a new house. Well, that's only partially
true. We moved into a 63-year-old house, but it's new to us. One of
the first things I did in the &ldquo;new&rdquo; house was to set up Wi-Fi. Thanks
to the multiple floors and old plaster and lath walls, setting up a
reliable wireless network proved to be quite challenging. I learned a
lot along the way and figured it would be a perfect topic for an
Open-Source Classroom series. So in this article, I discuss the technologies
themselves. It's important to understand how Wi-Fi works so you know what
sort of setup you want to install. Is 802.11ac worth the cost? Will
it make a difference? Should you abandon the 2.4GHz frequency range
altogether? Those questions will be easier to answer once you understand
how the various standards work.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185e580.0x1956568"></a>
Frequency Ranges</h2></div></div><p>
There currently are three common frequency ranges used in wireless
networking. The most common is the 2.4GHz range. The newer 802.11ac
standard (and oddly, the mostly failed 802.11a standard) uses the 5GHz
range. And, a handful of devices currently are utilizing the 900MHz
range of the spectrum for networking. The latter isn't used very commonly,
but that likely will change with the ratification of 802.11ah, which will
standardize the spectrum for some really interesting use cases. For now,
however, Wi-Fi access points are either 2.4GHz, 5GHz or both.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185e580.0x1956670"></a>
2.4GHz</h2></div></div><p>
The frequencies between 2.4 and 2.5GHz are broken up into 14 channels, all
5MHz apart. Channel 1 starts at 2.412GHz, and channel 14 is actually 12MHz
above channel 13 (Figure 1). Every country handles the availability of
those channels differently, but in the US, channels 1&ndash;11 are available
for public use. If wireless networks used only 5MHz of bandwidth to
transmit and receive data, that would mean we'd have 11 channels to use,
and we could have up to 11 access points in one place without worrying
about interference.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11930f1.large.jpg"><img src="11930f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. The 2.4GHz spectrum is so crowded and has so few usable
channels (image from Wikipedia).
</p></div></div><p>
Unfortunately, that's not how Wi-Fi works. Every wireless device using
the 2.4GHz frequency range actually uses 22MHz of bandwidth when sending
and receiving data. That increased bandwidth allows for more data to
get through, and 22MHz was decided to be the standard. That means if
a user transmits on channel 1, it bleeds 11MHz above and 11MHz below
2.412GHz. If you do the math, that means channel 1 actually bleeds over
channel 2 and channel 3! Since each channel bleeds over its two adjacent
channels, the only usable channels in the 2.4GHz range are
channel 1, channel 6 and channel 11. (Again, see Figure 1 for a visual
representation.) In Japan, channels 12&ndash;14 are available for public use,
and that makes channel 14 an option, but only barely. If you look at
the graph, you can see channels 13 and 14 bump right up against each other.
</p><p>
In order to be complete, I also should mention that 802.11n allows for
40MHz of bandwidth per channel, even in the 2.4GHz frequency range. That
increased bandwidth per channel means more throughput, but it comes at a
terrible cost. Since the entire usable spectrum between channels 1 and
11 is 55MHz, there's really room only for a single device in
the 2.4GHz spectrum to operate at 40MHz! It might seem like you could
fit two channels in that space, but there's just not enough space in
the legally usable spectrum to fit more than one channel that wide. So
although it's technically possible to use 40MHz-wide channels with 2.4GHz
using 802.11n, by default, it has to use 20MHz. Even when changing the
default setting to force 40MHz, devices must scale back to 20MHz if
they sense interference. There are a few notable products that ignore
that requirement (the original Apple Airport Extreme for instance),
but it's just not wise to waste all the available spectrum on a single
channel! If you want to use 40MHz-wide channels with 802.11n, the answer
is to use 5GHz.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185e580.0x1956a38"></a>
5GHz</h2></div></div><p>
The world of 5GHz networking is an interesting one. All the way back
in 1999, 802.11a was released that functioned in the 5GHz range. The
spectrum at that frequency is far less busy, and using a different signal
modulation, it allowed for up to 54Mbps speeds. 802.11a used 20MHz
of bandwidth, and since there is much more room in the 5GHz spectrum
range, overlapping channels were far less of an issue. Unfortunately,
802.11a suffered from range and interference problems. The higher
frequency doesn't penetrate walls as well, and as such, it wasn't as
reliable in a building environment. Because it offered more potential
bandwidth (54Mbps over 802.11b's 11Mbps), it was popular in corporate
environments, but it was outmoded quickly by 802.11g. In 2003, 802.11g
took the frequency modulation technology from 802.11a and applied it in
the 2.4GHz spectrum. That allowed the best of both worlds, because it
achieved up to 54Mbps while penetrating walls just as good as 802.11b did.
</p><p>
I mentioned that 802.11n can use 2.4GHz, but it also can use 5GHz for
transmitting and receiving. The main problem is that not all devices that
claim to be 802.11n are equipped with 5GHz radios. They're technically
802.11n-compatible, but only if that 802.11n is using the 2.4GHz
spectrum. It's very frustrating. Most people end up implementing 802.11n
on <span   class="emphasis"><em>both</em></span> 2.4GHz and 5GHz spectra. Thankfully, the 5GHz spectrum is both
bigger and less busy, because not as many devices currently are utilizing
it. Also, thanks to MIMO technology (more on that later), the penetration
and interference isn't as much of an issue as it was with 802.11a.
</p><p>
Figure 2 shows the 5GHz band along with available channels. If you use
the same 20MHz channel width used by the 2.4GHz channels, that means you
have upwards of 25 non-overlapping channels from which to choose! The reality
isn't quite that rosy, however, because more than half the available
frequencies are called DFS channels, or Dynamic Frequency Selection
channels. They work, but if your hardware finds them being used by
military or weather radios, it is forced to switch to another channel,
even if you assigned the DFS channel manually. It's nice that we're able
to use those frequencies, but we're truly second class citizens, because
we always get moved if the channels are officially in use.
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="11930f2.large.jpg"><img src="11930f2.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 2. The 5GHz Channel Allocation (image from <a href="http://securityuncorked.com" target="_self">securityuncorked.com</a>)
</p></div></div><p>
For most people, that means using the nine available non-overlapping
channels that are outside the DFS range. You can see that channels 36,
40, 44, 48, 149, 153, 157, 161 and 165 are available to use without
concern of getting bumped by weather or military. Things do become a
little more complicated if you want to use more bandwidth per channel,
however. Remember that 802.11n can use 40MHz per channel, which you
see in Figure 2 will limit your available channels to four non-DFS, or
12 if you include DFS. Still, four completely open 40MHz channels is far,
far better than the single 40MHz channel available in the 2.4GHz spectrum!
</p><p>
The new kid on the block is, of course, 802.11ac. This new standard
uses <span   class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span> the 5GHz spectrum, and it allows a wide variety of channel
widths. The old standard of 20MHz is allowed, but also widths of 40, 80
and even 160MHz are allowed for some serious throughput! As channel width
increases, the number of non-overlapping channels decreases, of course,
so Figure 2 shows how many options you have in each scenario. I don't
think there are any devices currently on the market that support 160MHz
channels, but I could be wrong.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185e580.0x1956fb8"></a>
Why Is 802.11ac So Much Faster? (MIMO)</h2></div></div><p>
You might be wondering why 802.11ac is touted as so much faster than
even 40MHz-wide 802.11n access points. The answer is similar to why
802.11n is so much faster than 802.11g. You probably noticed that 802.11n
and 802.11g both use the 2.4GHz spectrum (Table 1), and yet although
802.11g is limited to 54Mbps, the &ldquo;n&rdquo; standard can achieve speeds up to
300Mbps. That's because with 802.11n, Multiple Input Multiple Output
(MIMO) technology allows multiple antennas to transmit and receive at
the same time.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x185e580.0x1957170"></a><p class="title"><b>

You can shop at the store and see 802.11n access points and routers
boasting speeds of 150Mbps and others boasting 300Mbps. That's a
multiplier based on the number of antennas the access points use at
once. (Note: some vendors claim 802.11n access points can achieve 600Mbps,
but they're just using fancy marketing to sound faster than they really
are. They're simply adding 300Mbps transmit and 300Mbps receive to get 600;
you can't really get 600Mbps transfer rates.) The 802.11n spec allows
for four data streams at once, which is what makes it so much faster than
802.11g, which uses only a single data stream.
</p><p>
With 802.11ac, that number has been increased to a possible eight simultaneous
data streams, meaning the potential throughput is more than 2Gbps. No
hardware currently supports that many data streams, nor the channel
width required to achieve it, but the standard supports a very fast
future for 802.11ac.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185e580.0x194e920"></a>
5GHz Flexibility Solves Penetration Problem</h2></div></div><p>
The original problem faced by 802.11a's use of the 5GHz spectrum has been
solved by several means. First, far more channels are available,
so an increased number of access points can be near each other without
concern of overlapping each other. That means a higher density of access
points and a higher density of supportable clients.
</p><p>
The other &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to the 5GHz propagation problem is that with MIMO
technology, a weaker signal is still very fast, because multiple antennas can
work together even on a degraded connection. With 802.11a, there was only
a single stream of data, so if the signal got weak, the throughput slowed
way down. With MIMO, you get the advantage of multiple weaker signals,
which add up to a decent speed even in an area of weak reception.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x185e580.0x194eb30"></a>
So What on Earth to Buy?!?!?</h2></div></div><p>
Although it would be nice simply to decide to go 5GHz only and buy the
newest, fastest 802.11ac access point you can, it's not really a
practical idea. Many devices still contain only 2.4GHz 802.11n radios,
so you have to provide something on the overly saturated 2.4GHz
spectrum. Thankfully, most access points provide dual-band support,
and you can have both 5GHz and 2.4GHz options available.
</p><p>
Sometimes it's better to have separate 2.4GHz and 5GHz access points,
because you might need more 5GHz APs to cover the same area. Sometimes
devices that support 5GHz networks will default to 2.4GHz if both are
available with the same SSID. It can be very frustrating to figure
out how best to support your devices! 
</p><p>
In my next article, I'll tackle the
actual planning, purchasing and installation of a wireless network in
your home or business. Thankfully, having a firm understanding of the
technology makes the next part a lot more fun. In the meantime,
I recommend checking out your wireless devices to see what type
of radios they have. Do you have anything that will take advantage of
a 5GHz network? Anything that is 802.11ac-compatible? Do you want to
future-proof your wireless network? Answer those questions to prepare for
Part II of this series.
