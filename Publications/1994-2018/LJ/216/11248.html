<h2 class="title">diff -u: What's New in Kernel Development</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Zack Brown</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #216, April 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>Arjan van de Ven</b></span> recently found a way to
reduce <span   class="bold"><b>boot times</b></span> on most
systems by a staggering amount. Instead of the usual approach,
starting each CPU in turn, Arjan's patch starts them all at once. On
his system, he achieved a 40% faster bootup with this patch.
This also seems to be just the beginning. Arjan has plans to get
userspace started up after just the first CPU starts up, while the
other CPUs are still pending. This could give the user a usable system
extremely quickly. However, as he and <span   class="bold"><b>Ingo
Molnar</b></span> both agreed, this
would involve some highly invasive changes to the kernel that would
certainly result in much breakage throughout the entire system. Their
plan is to go slowly and carefully, fixing problems as they're
revealed, and ultimately achieve massive goodness.
</p><p>
Several kernel developers, including <span   class="bold"><b>Pavel
Emelyanov</b></span>, <span   class="bold"><b>Oleg Nesterov</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>Tejun Heo</b></span> are working on a way to
control the <span   class="bold"><b>process ID</b></span> (PID) of
a given process. Most of the time the PID is not relevant to ordinary
users&mdash;what typically matters most is that the process runs
correctly. But, sometimes the ability to change the PID can enable
really cool features, such as migrating processes cleanly from one
computer to another or allowing a debugger to switch cleanly between
several saved states of a running process.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, finding the best place in the kernel source tree to
provide control over PIDs is not easy. And, <span   class="bold"><b>Linus
Torvalds</b></span> has said
that it's important to keep this kind of feature from running away
with itself, adding strange new functionality in places where such
things aren't needed and only muddy the interfaces.
</p><p>
Believe it or not, it's official kernel policy to restrict patches to
<span   class="bold"><b>80 columns</b></span> of text or less. This ancient requirement dates back to the
era of text-mode consoles that were themselves restricted to 80
columns. But there are some places in the kernel source that violate
that rule, and a very large number of kernel developers would love to
ditch the restriction altogether or at least make it something a bit
more palatable, like 100 columns or (for the sake of
multiple-of-8-ness) 96 columns.
</p><p>
Folks like Ingo Molnar and <span   class="bold"><b>Andrew Morton</b></span> endorsed changing the policy,
and a lot people were very pleased. But, apparently Linus Torvalds is
dead set against changing it. In his post to the mailing list, he said
that yes, some parts of the kernel were exceptions and used more than
80 columns. He also said that it was important to <span   class="emphasis"><em>keep</em></span> those places
exceptional, and not get the idea that more and more code on a single
line would be a good thing.
</p><p>
So, for now at least, and really probably for a good number of years
to come, the 80-column limit on kernel patches remains in effect.

<h2 class="title">Make TV Awesome with Bluecop</h2>

A few weeks back, I was whining that although <span   class="emphasis"><em>Doctor
Who</em></span> was available
on Amazon Prime streaming, I didn't have any way to watch it on my
television. Thankfully, my friend Richard Servello pointed me to
the bluecop repo for XBMC. Not only does bluecop support Amazon Prime
streaming, but it also has add-ons for Hulu and countless other
network-video-streaming collections.

</p></div></div><p>
Now, not only can I take advantage of my Amazon Prime membership on our
55" TV, but also my family can watch clips of <span   class="emphasis"><em>The Target
Lady</em></span> on Hulu. I
don't think the add-ons in the bluecop repo are endorsed by any of the
streaming-media providers, but it seems they pull video only from the
Web. If you want to extend your XBMC setup to include a huge selection
of streaming media, check out the bluecop repository (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/bluecop-xbmc-repo" target="_self">code.google.com/p/bluecop-xbmc-repo</a>). Richard, thanks
for the tip!

IRC is one of those chat protocols that really lends itself well to the
command line. Irssi works very well, and because it runs on a server, all
a person needs to use it is a terminal window. For many users, however,
a friendly GUI makes the chatting experience a lot nicer. In Linux and
Windows, there are many options from which to choose, but in OS X, the
options are a little more limited. Thankfully, one of the nicest IRC
clients for OS X also happens to be open source!
</p><div       class="mediaobject"><img src="11248fossf1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p>
</p></div></div><p>
Colloquy has the familiar look of an OS X program, but it doesn't sacrifice
any of the text-based power of IRC. It supports file transfers,
notification sounds, and if you read Bill Childer's article
&ldquo;Seamlessly Extending IRC to Mobile Devices&rdquo; in the March
2012 issue,
you'll know it can work with your Irssi install for some really awesome
multi-endpoint chatting.
</p><p>
Colloquy is available for OS X, and also for mobile devices. Check it

<h2 class="title">Chemistry the Gromacs Way</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Joey Bernard</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #216, April 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
In this article, I'm diving into chemistry again. Many packages,
both commercial and open source, are available to make chemistry calculations
at the quantum level. The one I cover here is gromacs (<a href="http://www.gromacs.org" target="_self">www.gromacs.org</a>). It should be available for your
distribution via its package manager.
</p><p>
The gromacs package is actually a full complement of
small applications to take care of all of the steps from creating the
initialization files, to doing the computational run, to doing analysis
and visualization of the results. You also may notice more than one
version available. For example, Ubuntu has both a single-processor version and an MPI version to do the calculations
on a parallel machine. If you have a multicore machine
or a cluster of machines at your disposal, this can help speed up
your calculations quite a bit.
</p><p>
Before I start, here's a little background as to what types
of calculations are possible and what methods gromacs uses. Ideally in
computational chemistry, you should be able to take the Schrodinger's
equations for the system in question and solve them completely. But,
outside of very simple systems of only a few atoms, doing so becomes
impossible rather quickly. This means some sort of approximation is
required to get a result. In gromacs, the approximation method
is molecular dynamics (MD). MD simulations solve Newton's equation for a
set of interacting particles to get their trajectories. The total force
on a particle from all of the other particles is calculated and then
divided by the mass of the particle to get its acceleration. This is
calculated for all of the particles, and every one moves according to
its acceleration. Then, time is stepped one unit, and the whole thing is
calculated again. You can increase the spatial and temporal resolution,
at the cost of more computer time, until you get results that are accurate
enough for your purposes.
</p><p>
MD simulations have several limitations.
The first is that it
is a classical simulation. In most cases, this is fine, but there are
situations when you need to know the quantum effects of the atoms in
your system. The second limitation is that electrons are in their ground
state and are treated as if they move instantly to remain in orbit around
their atoms. This means you can't model chemical reactions or any
other electronic interactions. The next limitation is that long-range
interactions are cut off. This becomes a serious issue when dealing with
charged particles. The last limitation that I look at here is the fact
that periodic boundary conditions are being used to try to simulate
bulk systems. This, combined with the cut-off mentioned above, means
you can end up with some unphysical results, especially during long runs.
</p><p>
Now that you have some background, how do you actually use gromacs? You
need to start with the inputs: the initial position of all the atoms,
the initial velocities and the interaction potential describing the
forces between all of the atoms. The center of mass of the entire system
is usually defined as having zero velocity, meaning there are no
external forces on the system. Once this initial data is entered, gromacs
needs to calculate the forces, apply these forces to each particle and
calculate their new positions. Once they have moved, gromacs needs to
recalculate the forces. This is done using the leapfrog algorithm. To
get a better feel for what this looks like, let's consider a concrete
example: a protein in water.
</p><p>
The first step is to come up with the initialization files needed to
do your calculation. This can be done completely from scratch, but in
many cases, it isn't necessary. In the case of proteins, there is the
Protein Data Bank (PDB), located at <a href="http://www.pdb.org" target="_self">www.pdb.org</a>. Make
sure the protein structure has the required detail you are looking for
in your simulation. You also can load it up in PyMOL and see what it
looks like. When you are happy with your selection, you can use it to
generate the required initialization files for gromacs with
<tt  >pdb2gmx</tt>:

<pre     class="programlisting">
pdb2gmx -f my_protein.pdb -water tip3p
</pre>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
where <tt  >tip3p</tt> is one of the water models that you can select. This
command generates several output files, the most important of which are
conf.gro, topol.top and posre.itp. At this point, you still haven't
added the water to the initialization files. To do so, you first need to
define a box to hold the water and the protein. To do that, you
would edit the configuration files with the following:


<pre     class="programlisting">
editconf -f conf.gro -bt dodecahedron -d 0.5 -o box.gro
</pre>
</p><p>
This defines a box with the shape of a dodecahedron and a diameter of
0.5nm. You also can use boxes with cubic or octahedron shapes. Now that
you have a box, you can add the water with the command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
genbox -cp box.gro -cs spc216.gro -p topol.top -o solvated.gro
</pre>
</p><p>
This command takes the box (box.gro) and fills it with water molecules
as defined in the file spc216.gro. The <tt  >-p topol.top</tt> option adds this
water to the topology of the system. Finally, all of this is written
out to the file solvated.gro.
</p><p>
If you tried to run it now, you probably would run into issues because
of large forces caused by the introduced water molecules. To deal with
that, you can minimize the energy of the system before actually doing
any calculations. You can do this by creating a parameter file to define
how to do the minimization. For example:

<pre     class="programlisting">
------em.mdp------
integrator   = steep
nsteps       = 200
nstlist      = 10
rlist        = 1.0
coulombtype  = pme
rcoulomb     = 1.0
vdw-type     = cut-off
rvdw         = 1.0
nstenergy    = 10
------------------
</pre>
</p><p>
In this example, the minimization is being done by steepest-descent,
over 200 steps. You can look up the details of all the other options
in the gromacs documentation. With this finished, you can do all of the
necessary pre-processing with the <tt  >grompp</tt>
command:


<pre     class="programlisting">
grompp -f em.mdp -p topol.top -c solvated.gro -o em.tpr
</pre>
</p><p>
The actual minimization is handled through:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mdrun -v -deffnm em
</pre>
</p><p>
The prefix <tt  >em</tt> is used for all of the relevant filenames, with different
extensions. This makes it easier to do all of the pre-processing and
get the initialization steps completed on your desktop, then doing
the actual run on a supercomputer.
</p><p>
When you are ready to do the final run, you need to set up a parameter
file describing the details. In this example, you could use something like
this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
------run.mdp------
integrator   = md
nsteps       = 5000
dt           = 0.002
nstlist      = 10
rlist        = 1.0
coulombtype  = pme
rcoulomb     = 1.0
vdw-type     = cut-off
rvdw         = 1.0
tcoupl       = Berendsen
tc-grps      = protein non-protein
tau-t        = 0.1 0.1
ref-t        = 298 298
nstxout      = 1000
nstvout      = 1000
nstxtcout    = 100
nstenergy    = 100
------------------
</pre>
</p><p>
With this parameter file, you can do the pre-processing with:

<pre     class="programlisting">
grompp -f run.mdp -p topol.top -c pr.gro -o run.tpr
</pre>
</p><p>
The actual MD calculation is done with the command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
mdrun -v -deffnm run
</pre>
</p><p>
Now you can go off and drink a few days' worth of coffee. The actual
runtime will depend on how many processors you have to throw at the
problem.
</p><p>
Once this run is completed, you still need to analyze it to see what you
can learn from it. You can compare the results to experimental results
from X-ray structure measurements. You can measure the displacement of
the heavy atoms from the X-ray structure with the g_rms program. You
can analyze distance and hydrogen bonds with the g_dist and
g_hbond programs. You can even make a movie with the trjconv program:

<pre     class="programlisting">
trjconv -s run.gro -f run.xtc -e 2500.0 -o movie.pdb
</pre>
</p><p>
This will export 2.5ns to a movie of the trajectories. You then can view
it using PyMOL.
</p><p>
This short article has provided only the faintest taste of what gromacs can
do. I hope it sparks your interest in reading up on it and doing some new
and interesting work.

If you're interested in how much energy your electronics use, it's hard
to find a device better than a Kill A Watt&mdash;except maybe the Kill A Watt
EZ! P3 International now offers model P4600, which provides the same
features as its predecessor, but it also automatically calculates device
cost per day, week, month or year.

</p></div></div><p>
P3's new version does automatic calculation, and it also has a battery-powered memory to retain measurements even when unplugged. We still
recommend using a short extension cord, because it's often difficult to read
the Kill-A-Watt when it's plugged in to the wall. We recommend checking
devices you suspect of high usage, and also those you don't. A laser
printer, for example, uses very little power when idle, but things like
an electronic pet-containment fence or even a doorbell can use much more
than you'd suspect. Visit <a href="http://p3international.com/products/p4460.html" target="_self">p3international.com/products/p4460.html</a> for more

Nuvola Player (formerly known as google-music-frame) is a Linux
application that integrates cloud-based music services into your Linux
desktop. I've tested it only with Google Music, but Nuvola now supports
Google Music, Grooveshark, Hype Machine and 8tracks. It also supports
Last.FM scrobbling.

</p></div></div><p>
What makes Nuvola better than a standard Web browser is that it
integrates with the Linux desktop. Nuvola gets its own tray icon and
supports multimedia keys on keyboards that have them. I traditionally
store my music files in Dropbox, but since Google Music has excellent
support on Android phones, I find myself using the cloud-based
service almost exclusively. Nuvola makes that experience much nicer.

<h2 class="title">2-Plan Desktop&mdash;the Free Project Management App</h2>
<div class="titlepage"><div><div class="author"><h3 class="author">Scott Anderson</h3></div><div class="issuemoyr">Issue #216, April 2012</div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><p>
I have been searching for an eternity for a suitable project management software package that
doesn't conflict with my limited budget.
My needs seem like they should be 
relatively easy to fulfill: something simple, flexible, stable and
robust that has the ability to grow with my needs, even though I may
 not be aware of what those needs actually are yet. My options have been
extremely limited, as most of my peers have grown accustomed to the
mainstream software (Microsoft Project) and the standard output it has
produced for them. But, my situation has, without a doubt, changed for the
better!
</p><p>
I recently found the answer to my endless on-line searches&mdash;2-Plan
Desktop. 2-Plan is available as an open-source solution that runs on
multiple operating systems, including my bread-and-butter Linux. It also
comes with a feature set that is very comparable to Microsoft Project, but
without the hefty price tag. Other features further distinguish 2-Plan from
many of the other well-known solutions. 
</p><p>
One of these features is the simple
but effective graphical work breakdown structure (WBS). Users have the
ability to create and reuse similar work packages across multiple
projects with ease, saving time by eliminating duplication of work. By
utilizing the drag-and-drop abilities within the WBS, users can
define work packages with little-to-no requirements quickly and create a
generalized top-down overview during the initiation phase. Then at a later
time, users can revisit these work packages and further define as the requirements
become available.
</p><p>
A second great feature is the ability to define various duration types for
work packages. This feature is not common among all applications with the
exception of Microsoft Project. Whether it be a fixed duration, manual or
effort-driven, I can specify the duration type and work toward
achieving an overall better-executed project plan. 
</p><p>
Another great feature
(or downloadable plugin that is available from the 2-Plan site) is the
Extended Project Explorer. This feature is similar to mind-mapping software
applications where the software displays your work packages in an animated
graphical snapshot. Microsoft Project and Gantt Chart don't even offer
this solution. 
</p><p>
Despite the fact that 2-Plan is open source, it definitely does not come
with a limited set of features or options that are available only in the
so-called &ldquo;premium packages&rdquo;, as often is the case.
There is no set limit to the amount of projects users are allowed to create
within the software. An adequate forum is also available from the software creators 
to assist with any problems or suggestions for improvements
you may have. The reporting features are more than adequate and similar to
most other project management software packages.
</p><p>
Project managers tend to become very familiar with the ability to assign
project milestones directly to work packages. Project milestones typically
play an integral part within a project plan. 2-Plan is similar to MS
Project as this feature is built in. 
</p><p>
Template creation is a snap within
2-Plan. These templates include the basics, such as work packages, teams and
roles that will cut down overall project planning time tremendously. 
</p><p>
2-Plan incorporates the best of both the standard project management and
Agile philosophies. I have found other software packages to lean more
toward one side of the spectrum or the other, not allowing the
flexibility or straightforwardness that is needed in real-world projects.
I truly believe the software I use should allow me to work in a way
that fits my standards best instead of making me alter everything I do
to fit the software I'm using. 
</p><p>
2-Plan allows me to do exactly that and work more efficiently in a manner
to which
I have now grown accustomed. Having tried many products during the years
that claim to be similar to MS Project or Gantt Chart in their overall
feature sets, most seem to fall short in their promises. Very few have
delivered something close, and still fewer have delivered a software
package with similar features and a price tag I could afford.
2-Plan Desktop has the features I need, and I have to say only one word
when it comes to the pricing of the package&mdash;<span   class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span>. If you find yourself
looking to stay on a more flexible OS and also needing a project
management solution that can grow with you and your responsibilities,
consider 2-Plan Desktop. It will fit into
your budget&mdash;big or small. You will not be disappointed.
