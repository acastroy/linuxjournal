System administrators at the USENIX LISA 2011
conference (LISA is a great system administration conference, by the way)
in Boston in December got to hear Michael Perrone's
presentation &ldquo;What Is Watson?&rdquo;
</p><p>
Michael Perrone is the Manager of Multicore Computing from
the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. The entire presentation
(slides, video and MP3) is available on the USENIX Web site
at <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa11/tech" target="_self">www.usenix.org/events/lisa11/tech</a>, and if you
really want
to understand how Watson works under the hood, take
an hour to listen to Michael's talk (and the sysadmin Q&amp;A
at the end).
</p><p>
I approached Michael after his talk and asked if there was a sysadmin
on his team who would be willing to answer some questions about
handling Watson's system administration, and after a brief introduction to
Watson, I include our conversation
below.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc92580.0xd8a568"></a>
What Is Watson?</h2></div></div><p>
In a nutshell, Watson is an impressive demonstration of the
current state of the art in artificial intelligence: a computer's
ability to answer questions posed in natural language
(text or speech) correctly.
</p><p>
Watson came out of the IBM DeepQA Project and is an application
of DeepQA tuned specifically to <span   class="emphasis"><em>Jeopardy</em></span> (a US TV trivia game show).
The &ldquo;QA&rdquo; in DeepQA stands for Question Answering, which means the
computer can answer your questions, spoken in a human language
(starting with English).
The &ldquo;Deep&rdquo; in DeepQA means the computer is able to analyze deeply
enough to handle natural language text and speech successfully.
Because natural language is unstructured, deep analysis is required
to interpret it correctly.
</p><p>
It demonstrates (in a popular format) a computer's capability to interface with
us using
natural language, to &ldquo;understand&rdquo; and answer questions correctly
by quickly searching a vast sea of data and correctly picking out
the vital facts that answer the question.
</p><p>
Watson is thousands of algorithms running on thousands of cores using
terabytes of memory, driving teraflops of CPU operations to deliver
an answer to a natural language question in less than five seconds. It is
an exciting feat of technology, and it's just a taste of what's to come.
</p><p>
IBM's goal for the DeepQA Project is to drive automatic Question
Answering technology to a point where it clearly and consistently
rivals the best human performance.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc92580.0xd8a988"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Watson's Vital Statistics</b></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
90 IBM Power 750 servers (plus additional I/O, network and cluster
controller nodes).
</p></li><li><p>
80 trillion operations per second (teraflops).
</p></li><li><p>
Watson's corpus size was 400 terabytes of data&mdash;encyclopedias, databases
and so on. Watson was disconnected from the Internet. Everything it knows
about the world came from the corpus.
</p></li><li><p>
Average time to handle a question: three seconds.
</p></li><li><p>
2880 POWER7 cores (3.555GHz chip), four threads per core.
</p></li><li><p>
500GB per sec on-chip bandwidth (between the cores on a chip).
</p></li><li><p>
10Gb Ethernet network.
</p></li><li><p>
15TB of RAM.
</p></li><li><p>
20TB of disk, clustered. (Watson built its semantic Web from the 400TB
corpus. It keeps the semantic Web, but not the corpus.)
</p></li><li><p>
Runs IBM DeepQA software, which has open-source components: Apache Hadoop
distributed filesystem and Apache UIMA for natural language processing.
</p></li><li><p>
SUSE Linux.
</p></li><li><p>
One full-time sysadmin on staff.
</p></li><li><p>
Ten compute racks, 80kW of power, 20 tons of cooling (for comparison,
a human has one brain, which fits in a shoebox, can run on a tuna-fish
sandwich and can be cooled with a handheld paper fan).
</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc92580.0xd8b488"></a>
How Does Watson Work?</h2></div></div><p>
First, Watson develops a semantic net.
Watson takes a large volume of text (the corpus) and parses that with
natural
language processing to create &ldquo;syntatic frames&rdquo;
(subject&rarr;verb&rarr;object).
It then uses syntactic frames to create &ldquo;semantic frames&rdquo;, which have a
degree
of probability.
Here's an example of semantic frames:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Inventors patent inventions (.8).
</p></li><li><p>
Fluid is a liquid (.6).
</p></li><li><p>
Liquid is a fluid (.5).
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Why isn't the probability 1 in any of these examples? Because of 
phrases like &ldquo;I speak English fluently&rdquo;. They tend to skew the
numbers.
</p><p>
To answer questions, Watson uses Massively Parallel Probabilistic
Evidence-Based Architecture. It uses the evidence from its
semantic net to analyze the hypotheses it builds up to answer
the question. You should watch the video of Michael's presentation
and look at the slides, as there is really too much under the hood
to present in a short article, but in a nutshell, Watson
develops huge amounts of hypotheses (potential answers) and uses
evidence from its semantic Web to assign probabilities to the answers
to pick the most likely answer.
</p><p>
There are many algorithms at play in Watson. Watson even
can learn from its mistakes and change its <span   class="emphasis"><em>Jeopardy</em></span> strategy.

runs on Linux, and uses xCAT and Ganglia for configuration management
and monitoring&mdash;all open-source tools.

Interview with Eddie Epstein on System Administration of the Watson
Supercomputer</h2></div></div><p>
Eddie Epstein is the IBM researcher responsible for scaling out
Watson's computation over thousands of compute cores in order
to achieve the speed needed to be competitive in a live
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Jeopardy</em></span>
game. For the past seven years, Eddie managed the IBM team doing
ongoing development of Apache UIMA. 
Eddie was kind enough to answer my questions about system administration
of the Watson cluster.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AT:</b></span> Why did you decide to use Linux?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>EE:</b></span> The project started with x86-based blades, and the researchers
responsible for admin were very familiar with Linux.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AT:</b></span> What configuration management tools did you use? How did you
handle updating the Watson software on thousands of Linux servers?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>EE:</b></span> We had only hundreds of servers. The servers ranged from
4- to 32-core machines. We started with CSM to manage OS installs,
then switched to xCat.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc92580.0x11842e0"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Configuration Management of the Watson Cluster</b></p><p>
CSM is IBM's proprietary Cluster Systems Management software
(<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/software/csm" target="_self">www-03.ibm.com/systems/software/csm</a>). It is intended
to simplify administration of a cluster and includes parallel
execution capability for high-volume pushes:
</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
[CSM is] designed for simple, low-cost management of distributed
and clustered IBM Power Systems in technical and commercial
computing environments. CSM, included with the IBM Power Systems
high-performance computer solutions, dramatically simplifies
administration of a cluster by providing management from a single
point-of-control....In addition to providing all the key functions
for administration and maintenance of typical distributed systems,
CSM is designed to deliver the parallel execution required to manage
clustered computing environments effectively.
</p></blockquote></div><p>
xCAT also originated at IBM. It was open-sourced in 2007. The xCAT
Project slogan is &ldquo;Extreme Cloud Administration Toolkit&rdquo;, and
its logo is a cat skull and crossbones. It now lives at
<a href="http://xcat.sourceforge.net" target="_self">xcat.sourceforge.net</a>,
which describes it as follows:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
Provision operating systems on physical or virtual machines:
SLES10 SP2 and higher, SLES 11 (incl. SP1), RHEL5.x, RHEL 6,
CentOS4.x, CentOS5.x, SL 5.5, Fedora 8-14, AIX 6.1, 7.1
(all available technology levels), Windows 2008, Windows 7,
VMware, KVM, PowerVM and zVM.
</p></li><li><p>
Scripted install, stateless, satellite, iSCSI or cloning.
</p></li><li><p>
Remotely manage systems: integrated lights-out management, remote
console, and distributed shell support.
</p></li><li><p>
Quickly set up and control management node services: DNS, HTTP, DHCP and
TFTP.
</p></li></ul></div><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>
xCAT offers complete and ideal management for HPC clusters,
render farms, grids, WebFarms, on-line gaming infrastructure,
clouds, data centers, and whatever tomorrow's buzzwords may be.
It is agile, extendible and based on years of system administration
best practices and experience.
</p><p>
xCAT grew out of a need to rapidly provision IBM x86-based machines
and has been actively developed since 1999. xCAT is now ten years
old and continues to evolve.
</p></blockquote></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AT:</b></span> xCat sounds like an installation system rather than a
change management system. Did you use an SSH-based
&ldquo;push&rdquo; model to push out changes to your systems?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>EE:</b></span> xCat has very powerful push features, including a multithreaded
push that interacts with different machines in parallel. It handles
OS patches, upgrades and more.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AT:</b></span> What monitoring tool did you use and why? Did you have any
cool visual models of Watson's physical or logical activity?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>EE:</b></span> The project used a home-grown cluster management system for
development activities, which had its own monitor. It also
incorporated ganglia. This tool was the basis for managing about
1,500 cores.
</p><p>
The Watson game-playing system used UIMA-AS with a simple
SSH-based process launcher. The emphasis there was on measuring
every aspect of runtime performance in order to reduce the overall
latency. Visualization of performance data was then done after
the fact. UIMA-AS managed the work on thousands of cores.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xc92580.0x1184ee8"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
What Is UIMA-AS?</b></p><p>
UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) is an open-source technology framework enabling Watson. 
It is a framework
for analyzing a sea of data to discover vital facts. It is computers
taking unstructured data as input and turning it into structured
data and then analyzing and working with the structured data to
produce useful results.
</p><p>
The analysis is &ldquo;multi-modal&rdquo;, which means many algorithms are employed,
and many kinds of algorithms.
For example, Watson had a group of algorithms for generating hypotheses,
such as using geo-spatial reasoning, temporal reasoning
(drawing on its historical database), pun engine and so on, and another group of
algorithms for scoring and pruning them to find the most likely answer.
</p><p>
In a nutshell, this is Massively Parallel Probabilistic Evidence-Based
Architecture. (The evidence comes from Watson's 400TB corpus of data.)
</p><p>
The &ldquo;AS&rdquo; stands for Asynchronous Scaleout, and it's a scaling framework for
UIMA&mdash;a way to run UIMA on modern, highly parallel cores, to benefit from
the continuing advance in technology.
UIMA brings &ldquo;thinking computers&rdquo; a giant step closer.
</p><p>
To understand unstructured information, first let's look at structured
information. Computers speak with each other using structured information. 
Sticking to structured information makes it easier to extract meaning from
data.
HTML and XML are examples of structured information. So is a CSV file.
Structured information standards are maintained by OASIS at
<a href="http://www.sgmlopen.org" target="_self">www.sgmlopen.org</a>.
</p><p>
Unstructured information is much more fluid and free-form.
Human communication uses unstructured information.
Until UIMA, computers have been unable to make sense out
of unstructured information.
Examples of unstructured information include audio (music), e-mails,
medical records, technical reports, blogs, books and speech. 
</p><p>
UIMA was originally an internal IBM Research project.
It is a framework for creating applications that do deep analysis
of natural human language text and speech.
</p><p>
In Watson, UIMA managed the work on nearly 3,000 cores.
Incidentally, Watson could run on a single core&mdash;it would take it six hours
to
answer a question. With 3,000 cores, that time is cut to 2&ndash;6 seconds.
Watson really takes advantage of massively parallel architecture to speed
up its processing.
</p></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AT:</b></span> What were the most useful system administration tools for you in
handling Watson and why?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>EE:</b></span> clusterSSH (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/clusterssh" target="_self">sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/clusterssh</a>)
was quite useful. That and simple shell scripts with SSH did most of the
work.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AT:</b></span> How did you handle upgrading Watson software? SSH in, shut down the
service, update the package, start the service? Or?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>EE:</b></span> Right, the Watson application is just restarted to pick up changes.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AT:</b></span> How did you handle packaging of Watson software?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>EE:</b></span> The Watson game player was never packaged up to be delivered elsewhere.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AT:</b></span> How many sysadmins do you have handling how many servers? You
mentioned there were hundreds of operating system instances&mdash;could
you be more specific? (How many humans and how many servers?)
Is there actually a dedicated system administration staff, or do
some of the researchers wear the system administrator hat along with
their researcher duties?
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>EE:</b></span> We have in the order of 800 OS
instances. After four years we finally
hired a sysadmin; before that, it was a part-time job for each of
three researchers with root access.
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>AT:</b></span> Regarding your monitoring system, how did you output the system
status? 
</p><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>EE:</b></span> We are not a production shop. If the
cluster has a problem, only
our colleagues complain.
