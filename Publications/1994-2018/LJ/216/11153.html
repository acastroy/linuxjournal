In my last article, I described the process of installing Linux on an EFI-based
computer. With any luck, that should have gotten your system up and
running; however, a number of problems can occur during or after
installation. In this article, I look at these issues, as well as general EFI
maintenance. Specifically, I describe how to use an emergency disc on an
EFI system, how to make your firmware recognize your bootloader, how to
configure GRUB and rEFIt to chainload to Windows (or to other OSes), how to
update your kernel and how to deal with miscellaneous kernel problems.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20b0580.0x21a8408"></a>
Booting an Emergency Disc</h2></div></div><p>
If you're like me, you keep a number of Linux emergency discs on hand.
These include both distribution installation discs, many of which contain
recovery systems, and specialized tools, such as Parted Magic,
SystemRescueCD and RIPLinuX. Such tools can be invaluable aids in
recovering from various system problems.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, most emergency discs don't yet include EFI boot support, the
rescue mode of distribution installers being an exception to this
rule.
Thus, if you want to use a rescue disc, such as Parted Magic,
SystemRescueCD or RIPLinuX, you may need to do so in BIOS mode. This is
usually not difficult. Most EFI implementations automatically switch to
BIOS mode when they detect BIOS-bootable optical discs; however, some might
need some coaxing to boot the disc. Check your firmware boot options if you
have problems booting a rescue disc in BIOS mode.
</p><p>
For the most part, using a BIOS-mode emergency disc is fine. You can mount
or repair your filesystems, edit configuration files, modify your partition
layout and even edit your EFI bootloader configuration. There is,
however, one important exception to this rule: the efibootmgr program,
which you use to register a bootloader with the EFI, is useless when the
computer is booted in BIOS mode. This program also is missing from the
usual emergency disc programs.
</p><p>
If you're having problems that necessitate using efibootmgr, therefore,
your best bet may be to use a distribution's installer in EFI mode. For
this purpose, you even can use a distribution other than the one you
normally use. Ubuntu includes a good live CD mode, and you can install
software to it using apt-get, as in <tt  >sudo apt-get install
efibootmgr</tt>.
Thereafter, you can use efibootmgr to manage bootloaders, even if your
computer doesn't normally run Ubuntu.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20b0580.0x21a86c8"></a>
Making EFI Recognize Your Bootloader</h2></div></div><p>
One common post-installation problem on EFI computers is that the computer
doesn't recognize your bootloader. The computer might inform you that it
couldn't find a bootable OS, or it might boot directly into Windows, OS X
or whatever other OS you had installed previously. Several solutions to
this problem exist, such as renaming your bootloader to the default name
or using efibootmgr to manage your EFI's list of bootloaders.
</p><p>
If no other OS exists on the computer, the simplest solution to the problem
is to rename your bootloader to use the default bootloader name,
EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the EFI System Partition (ESP). As described in
Part II of this series, this is the filename the EFI uses when you
haven't registered any other bootloader with the firmware. Thus, you can
rename your bootloader's default location (such as EFI/SuSE or EFI/ubuntu)
to EFI/BOOT and then rename the bootloader file itself (such as grub.efi
or elilo.efi) to bootx64.efi. In the case of GRUB Legacy, you should rename
the configuration file from grub.conf to bootx64.conf too.
</p><p>
If the computer boots straight into another OS, you may be able to rename
an existing EFI/BOOT directory and then rename your Linux bootloader as
just described. Alternatively, you can boot Linux in EFI mode using an
EFI-enabled emergency system and use efibootmgr to add your bootloader to
the EFI's boot list:

<pre     class="programlisting">
efibootmgr -c -l \\EFI\\elilo\\elilo.efi -L ELILO
</pre>
</p><p>
The details vary depending on the bootloader, of course. You may need to
change the path to the bootloader, which is specified using double
backslashes (\\) rather than the more conventional forward slash (/).
You can use efibootmgr to manipulate the boot list in other ways too.
Table 1 summarizes some of efibootmgr's options, but you can consult its
man page for more obscure options.
</p><div class="table"><a name="N0x20b0580.0x21a8930"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. The efibootmgr utility manages the EFI's list of

If you use efibootmgr without any options, it displays a summary of the
system's current bootloaders. You can add the -v option to produce
additional information. The preceding example used the -c option to create
a new boot manager entry, thus adding ELILO to the list of boot options
that the firmware provides. This command, though, might leave another bootloader earlier in the EFI's boot order. If you want to change that order,
you would use the -o option, as in:

<pre     class="programlisting">
efibootmgr -o 5,A,3
</pre>
</p><p>
This example tells the EFI to attempt to boot using bootloader #5; if that
fails, to try #A (hexadecimal); and if that fails, to try #3. The -n option
sets the bootloader to use on the next boot, overriding the default boot
order for that boot.
</p><p>
Some options require you to use the -b option to identify a specific bootloader. For instance, if you want to give a bootloader a new name in a
menu, you might type the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
efibootmgr -b 3 -L "Windows 7"
</pre>
</p><p>
This example gives entry #3 the label &ldquo;Windows 7&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, efibootmgr's effects are not 100% reliable. For instance, on
one of my computers, the -o option has no real effect. I must use the
firmware's own interface to adjust the boot order. More distressingly, some
reports indicate that efibootmgr damages some Macs' firmware, requiring
re-flashing the firmware. (The OS X &ldquo;bless&rdquo; utility serves a role similar
to efibootmgr on Macs.) Nonetheless, it's worth trying efibootmgr if you
want to add bootloaders or adjust the boot order on a UEFI-based PC.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20b0580.0x21a1000"></a>
Configuring GRUB to Chainload to Windows</h2></div></div><p>
If you're using GRUB Legacy or GRUB 2 and you want to dual-boot with
Windows, you may need to add an entry to the bootloader to make it work
correctly. On a BIOS-based computer, this entry would reference the Windows
boot partition, where part of the Windows bootloader resides. On an
EFI-based computer though, you must reference the Windows bootloader on
the ESP. A suitable entry in GRUB Legacy's grub.conf file looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
title Windows 7
        root (hd0,0)
        chainloader /EFI/microsoft/bootmgfw.efi
</pre>
</p><p>
This entry might need to be changed if your ESP is not the first partition
on the first disk, or if the bootloader isn't in its usual location. An
equivalent entry in GRUB 2's grub.cfg file looks like this:

<pre     class="programlisting">
menuentry "Windows 7" {
        set root='(hd0,gpt1)'
        chainloader /EFI/microsoft/bootmgfw.efi
}
</pre>
</p><p>
In GRUB 2, you probably would add such an entry to /etc/grub.d/40_custom
and then rebuild grub.cfg by using update-grub or some other configuration
script.
</p><p>
You can chainload other bootloaders in a similar way. One twist on Macs is
that the OS X bootloader resides on the OS X boot partition, as
/System/Library/CoreServices/boot.efi. GRUB Legacy can't mount Mac OS X's
HFS+ though, so you can't chainload OS X using GRUB Legacy. GRUB 2 can
mount HFS+ and so can chainload OS X in this way. GRUB 2 also can load the
OS X kernel directly, and your GRUB 2 configuration scripts might create a
rather wordy entry that does just that. If you want to dual-boot Linux and
OS X though, rEFIt is generally the best way to do the job. It gives you a
graphical menu showing OS X and your Linux bootloader.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20b0580.0x21a1318"></a>
Configuring rEFIt to Chainload to Windows</h2></div></div><p>
If you use ELILO to boot Linux, you'll need to use another boot manager to
boot non-Linux OSes. Although EFI implementations provide boot managers for
this purpose, they're generally quite awkward, so you may want to use rEFIt
to present a friendlier menu for dual booting.
</p><p>
As described in Part I of this series, rEFIt can chainload another bootloader, but it can't load a Linux kernel itself. You don't need to
configure rEFIt explicitly to boot any OS; it scans all the partitions it
can read for EFI bootloader files and generates a menu automatically.
Thus, rEFIt should detect Microsoft's bootloader file (called
bootmgfw.efi) and label it appropriately.
</p><p>
The trick is in rEFIt installation. The version available from the rEFIt
Web site is a &ldquo;fat binary&rdquo; (32-/64-bit) that works only on Macs. To use
rEFIt on a UEFI-based PC, you need a 64-bit-only version. Debian and Ubuntu
both ship with such versions; check the Resources section of this article for another
source.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20b0580.0x21a1528"></a></h2></div></div><div class="sidebar"><p class="title"><b>
Secure Boot and UEFI</b></p><p>
In September 2011, a small firestorm erupted concerning an obscure UEFI
feature known as Secure Boot. This feature, if enabled, causes the firmware
to boot only bootloaders that have been cryptographically signed using a
key stored in the firmware's Flash memory. The intent of Secure Boot is to
block one avenue that malware has used for decades: to load before the OS
loads, hang around and wreak havoc.
</p><p>
Microsoft is requiring that computers bearing its Windows 8 logo ship with
Secure Boot enabled. The problem is that the Linux community is very
diverse and has no centralized key, and manufacturers might not include
keys for individual Linux distributions. Thus, Secure Boot could become an
extra obstacle for installing Linux.
</p><p>
If you have a computer with Secure Boot enabled, and if this feature is
preventing you from booting Linux, you can look for an option to disable
this feature or to import or generate a key for your Linux distribution.
Unfortunately, I can't be more precise about how to work around this
problem, since computers with Secure Boot are still extremely rare.
</p><p>
In a worst-case scenario, a computer that ships with Windows 8 might lack
the ability to disable Secure Boot or to add your own keys. In such a case,
you won't be able to install Linux on the computer&mdash;at least, not without
replacing the firmware or hacking it in some way. If you've got such a
computer, your best bet is to return it to the store for a refund.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20b0580.0x21a1840"></a>
Updating Your Kernel</h2></div></div><p>
Assuming you've successfully installed Linux on an EFI-based computer, you
can use the system just as you'd use a BIOS-based installation. Most
operations, including most software updates, will work just as they do on a
BIOS-based computer. One possible exception to this rule is in kernel
updates.
</p><p>
Most distributions include scripts that automatically update your bootloader configuration to add a new kernel when you install one via the
distribution's package management system. This process usually works fine
if you use the distribution's own bootloader; however, as detailed in
previous articles in this series, you're more likely to have to deviate
from your distribution's default bootloader if you use EFI than if you use
BIOS. If this happens, you may need to manage the bootloader
configuration yourself manually.
</p><p>
Details of bootloader configuration vary with the bootloader. Part II of
this series described ELILO configuration, so you can use it as a reference
if you use ELILO. If you use GRUB Legacy or GRUB 2, any source of
documentation on those bootloaders under BIOS applies almost as well to
the EFI version. The main exception is in handling chainloading, as noted
earlier.
</p><p>
If you manage your bootloader yourself, the biggest problem is to
note carefully when you upgrade your kernel so that you can make suitable
changes to your bootloader configuration. If you miss an update, you'll
end up booting an old kernel. If your distribution uninstalls your old
kernel, your system might end up being unbootable. If you're comfortable
compiling your own kernel, you might consider doing so. That should give
you a kernel you manage yourself outside the package system, which
should give you a secure backup kernel.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20b0580.0x21a1a50"></a>
Dealing with Kernel and Video Problems</h2></div></div><p>
For the most part, Linux works equally well on BIOS-based and EFI-based
computers. The kernel interacts directly with hardware; once it's booted,
it has little need to use the firmware. There are exceptions to this rule though. Sometimes, kernel options (passed via your bootloader
configuration) can be helpful. Specifically:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >noefi</tt> &mdash; this option disables the kernel's support for EFI runtime
services. Ordinarily, you wouldn't want to do this, but sometimes bugs
cause Linux's EFI runtime services to misbehave, causing a failure to
boot or other problems. Using the noefi option can work around such
problems, at the cost of an inability to use the efibootmgr utility.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >reboot_type=k</tt> &mdash; this option disables the EFI's reboot runtime service.
This option can work around problems with failed reboot operations.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >reboot=e</tt> &mdash; this option is essentially the opposite of the preceding one;
it tells the kernel to attempt to reboot using the EFI's reboot runtime
service. It's normally the default on EFI boots, but you can try it if
Linux is rebooting improperly.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >reboot=a,w</tt> &mdash; this option tells Linux to perform warm reboots using
ACPI. This can work around bugs in some EFI implementations that cause
a system hang when rebooting.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >add_efi_memmap</tt> &mdash; this option alters how Linux allocates memory, which
can avoid memory conflicts with some EFI implementations.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >nomodeset</tt> &mdash; this option sometimes works around problems that cause a
blank video display.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
EFI implementations vary among themselves, and the Linux kernel has yet to
incorporate surefire workarounds for every quirk and bug. Thus, you may
need to experiment with these and perhaps with other options.
</p><p>
If you build your own kernel, you should be sure to include a few options:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
<tt  >CONFIG_EFI</tt> &mdash; this option, near the end of the Processor Type and
Features kernel configuration area, enables Linux to use the EFI runtime
services.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >CONFIG_FB_EFI</tt> &mdash; EFI provides its own framebuffer device, and this option
(available in the Graphics Support&rarr;Support for Frame Buffer Devices
kernel configuration area) enables the kernel to use the EFI's
framebuffer. You often can use a more device-specific framebuffer driver,
but this one can be an important fallback on some computers.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >CONFIG_EFI_VARS</tt> &mdash; this option, available in the Firmware Drivers kernel
area, provides access to EFI variables via Linux's sysfs. You need this
support to use efibootmgr.
</p></li><li><p>
<tt  >CONFIG_EFI_PARTITION</tt> &mdash; you'll find this option
in the File Systems&rarr;Partition Types kernel area. It enables support for GPT, so of course you
need it to boot from a GPT disk.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Some EFI-based computers present video difficulties. Such problems are
particularly common with Macs booted in EFI mode. Typically, the video
display goes blank in text mode, in X or in both. Unfortunately, there's
no easy solution to such problems. Sometimes though, switching bootloaders
can help. You also can try experimenting with framebuffer options
and your X configuration. Typing <tt  >Xorg -configure</tt> as root and with X
<span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> running generates an X configuration file, /root/xorg.conf.new.
Copying and renaming this file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf sometimes gets X up
and running.

Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>
EFI provides a number of improvements over the older BIOS it replaces.
These include quicker boot times, an integrated boot manager and the
ability to manage more complex bootloaders as files on a filesystem. In an
ideal world, the transition from BIOS to EFI should be painless, but in the
real world, developers require time to write the software to use EFI. At
the moment, all of the pieces for handling EFI exist&mdash;you have a choice
of EFI bootloaders, partitioning tools exist, the Linux kernel supports
EFI, and you even can use efibootmgr to configure the EFI's boot manager.
Distribution maintainers, however, have not yet worked out all the kinks in
integrating all of these tools. A few programs also have bugs or are
awkward to use. Knowing your way around these problems will help you make
the transition from a BIOS-based computer to one built around EFI. I hope
this series of articles helps you with that task.
