How to engineer an OpenLDAP directory
service to create a unified login for heterogeneous environments.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec82a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>
Directory services is one of the most interesting and crucial
parts of computing today. They provide our account management, basic
authentication, address books and a back-end repository for the
configuration of many other important applications.
</p><p>
It's been nine long years since Craig Swanson and Matt Lung originally
wrote their article &ldquo;OpenLDAP Everywhere&rdquo;
(<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, December 2002),
and almost six years since their follow-up article &ldquo;OpenLDAP Everywhere
Revisited&rdquo; (<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span>, July 2005).
</p><p>
In this multipart series, I cover how to engineer an OpenLDAP directory
service to create a unified login for heterogeneous environments. With
current software and a modern approach to server design, the aim is to reduce
the number of single points of failure for the directory.
</p><p>
In this article, I describe how to configure two Linux servers to host core network services
required for clients to query the directory service. I configure these
core services to be highly available through the use of failover pools
and/or replication.

Figure 1. An Overall View of Core Network Services, Including
LDAP (Note: the image of the hard disk icon in this figure was taken from the Open Icon
Library
Project: <a href="http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net" target="_self">openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net</a>.)

</p></div></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec88d8"></a>
Assumptions and Prerequisites</h2></div></div><p>
Certain approaches were taken in this design with small-to-medium
enterprises (SMEs) in mind. You may wish to custom-tailor the design if
you are a small-to-medium business (SMB) or large-scale enterprise.
</p><p>
The servers discussed in this article were installed with the latest
stable version of the Debian GNU/Linux. At the time of this writing, this
was Debian 6.0.2.1 (Squeeze). Although it has not been tested for Ubuntu,
Ubuntu users should be able to log in as root (run <tt  >sudo su
-</tt>) and have
few problems.
</p><p>
As per Figure 1, the fictional local domain name is
example.com. Four fictitious subnetworks exist: 192.168.1.0/24,
192.168.2.0/24, 192.168.3.0/24 and 192.168.4.0/24. Routing between
the four subnets is assumed to be working correctly. Where appropriate,
please substitute applicable values for your domain name, IP addresses,
netmask addresses and so on.
</p><p>
LDAP users are assumed to have home directories in /export/home rather
than /home. This allows LDAP credentials to be compatible for operating
systems other than Linux. Many proprietary UNIXes, for example, use
/export/home as the default home directory. /home on Solaris is also
reserved for other purposes (automount directories).
</p><p>
The design assumes that /export/home is actually a shared disk.
</p><p>
This is typically implemented as a mountpoint to an NFS server on a host
or NAS; however, the design makes no determination about how to achieve
the shared disk, which is beyond the scope of the article, so I'm leaving
it
to the reader to decide how to implement this.
</p><p>
You can opt not to implement the shared disk, but there are some serious
drawbacks if you don't. All LDAP users will need their $HOME directory
to be created manually by the administrator for every server to which they
wish to log in (prior to them logging in). Also, the files a user creates on one server
will not be available to other servers unless the user copies them to the
other server manually. This is a major inconvenience for users and creates
a waste of server disk space (and backup tape space) because of the
duplication of data.
</p><p>
All example passwords are set to &ldquo;linuxjournal&rdquo;, and it's
assumed you'll replace these with your own sensible values.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec8d50"></a>
Install Packages</h2></div></div><p>
On both linux01.example.com and linux02.example.com, use your preferred
package manager to install the ntp, bind9, bind9utils, dnsutils,
isc-dhcp-server, slapd and ldap-utils packages.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec8e58"></a>
Start with Accurate Timekeeping (NTP)</h2></div></div><p>
Accurate timekeeping between the two Linux servers is a requirement for
DHCP failover.
There are additional benefits in having accurate time, namely:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
It's required if you intend to implement (or already have implemented) secure
authentication with Kerberos.
</p></li><li><p>
It's required if you intend to have some form of Linux integration with
Microsoft Active Directory.
</p></li><li><p>
It's required if you intend to use N-Way Multi-Master replication in OpenLDAP.
</p></li><li><p>
It greatly assists in troubleshooting, eliminating the guesswork when comparing logfile timestamps between servers, networking equipment and client devices.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Once ntp is installed on both
linux01.example.com and linux02.example.com, 
you are practically finished. The Debian NTP team creates very sensible
defaults for ntp.conf(5). Time sources, such as 0.debian.pool.ntp.org
and 1.debian.pool.ntp.org, will work adequately for most scenarios.
</p><p>
If you prefer to use your own time sources, you can modify the lines
beginning with <tt  >server</tt> in /etc/ntp.conf. Replace the address with that
of your preferred time source(s).
</p><p>
You can check on both servers to see if your ntp configuration is correct
with the ntpq(1) command:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@linux01:~# ntpq -p
     remote           refid      st t when poll reac
h   delay   offset  jitter
====================================================
==========================
+warrane.connect 130.95.179.80    2 u  728 1024  377
   74.013  -19.461 111.056
+a.pool.ntp.uq.e 130.102.152.7    2 u  179 1024  377
   79.178  -14.069 100.659
*ntp4.riverwillo 223.252.32.9     2 u  749 1024  377

   78.818    6.485  72.161
root@linux01:~# 
</pre>
</p><p>
Don't be concerned if your ntpq output shows a different set of
servers. The *.pool.ntp.org addresses are DNS round-robin records that
balance DNS queries among hundreds of different NTP servers. The
important thing is to check that ntp can contact upstream NTP servers.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1dd0580.0x1ec9488"></a>
Name Resolution (DNS)</h2></div></div><p>
If the LDAP client can't resolve the hostname of the Linux servers
that run OpenLDAP, they can't connect to the directory services they
provide. This can include the inability to retrieve basic UNIX account
information for authentication, which will prevent user logins.
</p><p>
As such, configure ISC bind to provide DNS zones in a
master/slave combination between the two Linux servers. The example workstations
will be configured (through DHCP) to query DNS on linux01.example.com,
then linux02.example.com if the first query fails.
</p><p>
Note: /etc/bind/named.conf normally is replaced by the package manager
when the bind9 package is upgraded. 
Debian's default named.conf(5) has an <tt  >include
/etc/bind/named.conf.local</tt> statement so that site local zone
configurations added there are not lost when the bind9 package is upgraded.
</p><p>
On linux01.example.com, modify /etc/bind/named.conf.local
to include the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
//// excerpt of named.conf.local on linux01

// --- Above output suppressed

zone "168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
   type master;
   file "/etc/bind/db.168.192.in-addr.arpa";
   notify yes;
   allow-transfer { 192.168.2.10; }; // linux02
};

zone "example.com" {
   type master;
   file "/etc/bind/db.example.com";
   notify yes;
   allow-transfer { 192.168.2.10; }; // linux02
};

// --- Below output suppressed
</pre>
</p><p>
On linux01.example.com, create the zone files
/etc/bind/db.168.192.in-addr.arpa and /etc/bind/db.example.com, and populate
them with appropriate zone information. For very basic examples of
the zone files, see the example configuration files available on the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>LJ</em></span> FTP site (see Resources for the link).
</p><p>
Before committing changes to a production DNS server, always check that no
mistakes are present. Failure to do this causes the named(8) d&aelig;mon to
abort when restarted. You don't want to cause a major outage for production
users if there is a trivial error. On linux01.example.com:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# named-checkconf /etc/bind/named.conf
# named-checkconf /etc/bind/named.conf.local
# named-checkzone 168.192.in-addr.arpa /etc/bind/db.
168.192.in-addr.arpa
zone 168.192.in-addr.arpa/IN: loaded serial 20111003
01
OK
# named-checkzone example.com /etc/bind/db.example.c
om
zone example.com/IN: loaded serial 2011100301
OK
# 
</pre>
</p><p>
On linux01.example.com, instruct the named(8) d&aelig;mon to
reload its configuration files, then check that it didn't abort:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@linux01:~# /etc/init.d/bind9 reload
Reloading domain name service...: bind9.
root@linux01:~# ps -ef|grep named|grep -v grep
bind      1283     1  0 16:05 ?        00:00:00 /usr
/sbin/named -u bind
root@linux01:~# 
</pre>
</p><p>
It is possible during normal operations that the named(8) d&aelig;mon on
linux01.example.com could abort and the rest of the server would otherwise
continue to function as normal (that is, single service failure, not entire
server failure). As linux02.example.com will have a backup copy of the zones
anyway, linux01.example.com should use linux02.example.com as its secondary
DNS server.
</p><p>
On linux01.example.com, create and/or modify
/etc/resolv.conf. Populate it with the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
search example.com
nameserver 127.0.0.1
nameserver 192.168.2.10
</pre>
</p><p>
On linux01.example.com, check, and if necessary, modify
/etc/nsswitch.conf to include the following &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; definition. This line
already was in place for me, but it strictly does need to be present
for you if it isn't:

<pre     class="programlisting">

## /etc/nsswitch.conf on linux01 &amp; linux02

# --- Above output suppressed

hosts:          files dns

# --- Below output suppressed

</pre>
</p><p>
Finally, test that linux01.example.com can resolve records from
the DNS server:

<pre     class="programlisting">
root@linux01:~# dig linux02.example.com +short
192.168.2.10
root@linux01:~# dig -x 192.168.2.10 +short
linux02.example.com.
root@linux01:~# nslookup linux02.example.com
Server:         127.0.0.1
Address:        127.0.0.1#53

Name:   linux02.example.com
Address: 192.168.2.10

root@linux01:~# nslookup 192.168.2.10
Server:         127.0.0.1
Address:        127.0.0.1#53

10.2.168.192.in-addr.arpa       name = linux01.example.com.

root@linux01:~# 
</pre>
</p><p>
Now, configure linux02.example.com as the slave server. First,
modify /etc/bind/named.conf.local to include the following:

<pre     class="programlisting">
//// excerpt of named.conf.local on linux02

// --- Above output suppressed

zone "168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
   type slave;
   file "/var/lib/bind/db.168.192.in-addr.arpa";
   masters { 192.168.1.10; }; // the linux01 server
};

zone "example.com" {
   type slave;
   file "/var/lib/bind/db.example.com";
   masters { 192.168.1.10; }; // the linux01 server
};

// --- Below output suppressed
</pre>
</p><p>
Take careful note of the placement of the slave zone files in
/var/lib/bind, not in /etc/bind!
</p><p>
This change is for two reasons. First, /etc/bind is locked down with
restrictive permissions so named(8) is not able to write any files there.
named(8) on linux02.example.com cannot and should not write a transferred
zone file there.
</p><p>
Second, the /var partition is intentionally designated for files that will
grow over time. /var/lib/bind is the Debian chosen directory for named(8) to
store such files.
</p><p>
Please resist the urge to change permissions to
&ldquo;fix&rdquo; /etc/bind! I cannot
stress this enough. It not only compromises the security on your RNDC key
file, but also the dpkg package manager is likely to revert any change you made on
/etc/bind the next time the bind9 package is upgraded.
</p><p>
If you require a single location for both servers to store their zone files,
it would be better to move the local zone files on linux01.example.com
to /var/lib/bind, rather than force a change to /etc/bind on
linux02.example.com. Don't forget to update the paths for the zone files
in linux01.example.com's /etc/bind/named.conf.local accordingly.
</p><p>
On linux02.example.com, run named-checkconf(1) to check
the new configuration, as you did before for linux01.example.com. If the
new configuration checks out, tell named(8) to reload by running the
<tt  >/etc/init.d/bind9 reload</tt> command. Also check that
the d&aelig;mon didn't
abort by running <tt  >ps -ef|grep named|grep -v grep</tt> as was done before.
</p><p>
If the zone transfer from linux01.example.com was successful, you
should have something like the following appear in /var/log/syslog on
linux02.example.com:

<pre     class="programlisting">

</p><p>
On linux02.example.com, create and/or modify

search example.com
nameserver 127.0.0.1
nameserver 192.168.1.10
</pre>
</p><p>
This is the only device on the network that will ever have
linux02.example.com as its primary DNS server. It's done for performance
reasons, on the assumption that linux01.example.com will fail first. Of
course, you never can predict which server will fail first. However, if
linux02.example.com happens to fail first, the workstations, in theory,
won't notice it&mdash;DHCP tells them to query linux01.example.com before
linux02.example.com.
</p><p>
Now, on linux02.example.com, check, and if necessary, modify
/etc/nsswitch.conf to include the <tt  >hosts: files dns</tt> in the same way
performed previously. Check that dig(1) and nslookup(1) can resolve
linux01.example.com in a similar manner as done before.

IP Address Assignment (DHCP)</h2></div></div><p>
If your LDAP clients can't receive an IP address to communicate with
the network, they can't communicate with the OpenLDAP servers.
</p><p>
As such, configure ISC dhcpd to use failover pools
between the two Linux servers. This ensures that IP addresses always
are being handed out to clients. It also ensures that the two Linux
servers are not allocating the duplicate addresses to the workstations.
</p><p>
The failover protocol for dhcpd is still in development by ISC at the time
of this writing, 
but it is subject to change in the future. It works fairly well most
of the time in its current state, and it's an important part of mitigating
the risk of server failure for the directory service.
</p><p>
Create a new file on both linux01.example.com and
linux02.example.com by running the command <tt  >touch
/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.failover</tt>.
</p><p>
Separate the failover-specific configuration from the main
/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file. That way, /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf can be
synchronized between both servers without destroying the unique
configuration in the &ldquo;failover peer&rdquo; stanza. You never should synchronize
/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.failover between the two Linux servers.
</p><p>
On linux01.example.com, populate /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.failover
as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
failover peer "dhcp-failover" {
   primary;
   address linux01.example.com;
   port 519;
   peer address linux02.example.com;
   peer port 520;
   max-response-delay 60;
   max-unacked-updates 10;
   load balance max seconds 3;
   mclt 3600;
   split 128;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Notice that the parameters <tt  >split</tt> and
<tt  >mclt</tt> are specified only on the
primary server linux01.example.com.
</p><p>
<tt  >max-response-delay</tt> controls how
many seconds one server will wait for communication from the other
before it assumes a failure.
</p><p>
<tt  >split</tt> controls how many IP addresses
available in the pool are pre-allocated to each DHCP server. The only
valid values are from 0 to 255. As per the example, a <tt  >split
128;</tt> value governs that each server takes
50% of the leases of the entire pool.
</p><p>
On linux02.example.com, populate /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.failover
as follows:

<pre     class="programlisting">
failover peer "dhcp-failover" {
   secondary;
   address linux02.example.com;
   port 520;
   peer address linux01.example.com;
   peer port 519;
   max-response-delay 60;
   max-unacked-updates 10;
   load balance max seconds 3;
}
</pre>
</p><p>
Note: IANA has not allocated a reserved port number for ISC
dhcpd failover at the time of this writing. This means the port/peer port
numbers of 519 and 520 are subject to change.
</p><p>
On both linux01.example.com and
linux02.example.com, you now should populate
/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf with appropriate subnet information. For a very basic
example of dhcpd.conf, see the example configuration files provided in
the Resources section.
</p><p>
The crucial parameters to have in /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf are:

<pre     class="programlisting">
# excerpt of dhcpd.conf on linux01 and linux02

#-----------------
# Global DHCP parameters
#-----------------

# --- outputs heavily suppressed ----

#-----------------
# Failover parameters
#-----------------

include "/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf.failover";

# --- outputs heavily suppressed ---

subnet 192.168.3.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
   option routers 192.168.3.1;
   option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
   option broadcast-address 255.255.255.255;
   pool {
      failover peer "dhcp-failover";
      range 192.168.3.20 192.168.3.250;
   }
}

subnet 192.168.4.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
   option routers 192.168.4.1;
   option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
   option broadcast-address 255.255.255.255;
   pool {
      failover peer "dhcp-failover";
      range 192.168.4.20 192.168.4.250;
   }
}
</pre>
</p><p>
These parameters alone are not enough to get a new DHCP server up and
running. But, once a working dhcpd.conf is built for your network, add
the above parameters for DHCP failover.
</p><p>
Restart dhcpd(8) on both linux01.example.com and
linux02.example.com. Do this by running the command
<tt  >/etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server restart</tt>. Check that the dhcpd(8) process
did not abort by running <tt  >ps -ef|grep dhcpd|grep -v
grep</tt>.
</p><p>
If dhcpd(8) is no longer running, the problem is usually a typo. Re-check
in dhcpd.conf and dhcpd.conf.failover that every opening parenthesis
(the { character) has a closing parenthesis (the } character). Also check
that lines not ending with open/closed parentheses are terminated by a
semicolon (;).
</p><p>
Check /var/log/syslog on both servers for messages from dhcpd. When DHCP
failover works, both servers should say the pool is &ldquo;balanced&rdquo;, and
that &ldquo;I move from communications-interrupted to normal&rdquo; or
&ldquo;I
move from startup to normal&rdquo;.
</p><p>
Synchronize /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf from linux01.example.com to
linux02.example.com every time you modify it. This can be done manually,
via an rsync(1) script, via puppetd(8) or via the Network Information Service
(though I don't recommend NIS&mdash;it's insecure and obsoleted by DNS/LDAP
and rsync/puppet).
</p><p>
The drawback to the failover protocol is that it's a long way off from being
considered mature. There are plenty of weird situations where the protocol
fails to do its job. However, it will not be young forever, and when it does
work, it works well. I recommend you monitor your logs and sign up to
ISC's dhcp-users mailing list for assistance when things go wrong (see
Resources for a link).
</p><p>
One last note on the DHCP failover protocol: if you have more devices on
one subnet than 50% of the overall amount available in the pool
range, seriously consider re-engineering your network before implementing
DHCP failover.
</p><p>
The protocol inherently relies on having an excess of free addresses
to allocate, even after the pool range is cut in half by <tt  >split
128;</tt>.
</p><p>
The maximum amount of available IP addresses for DHCP in a C Class subnet
most of the time is 253 (255 addresses, minus 1 address for broadcast,
minus 1 address for the router).
</p><p>
If you have more than 126 devices within one failover subnet, either
split it into more subnets (for example, one subnet for each floor of
the building), or use a larger subnet than C Class. Configure the subnet
declaration in /etc/dhcpd.conf to increase its pool range accordingly. It
will save you problems later on.
</p><p>
Now that the DHCP servers are configured with failover pools, the final
thing to do is configure the 192.168.3.0/24 and 192.168.4.0/24 to
forward DHCP client broadcasts through the LAN/WAN to 192.168.1.10 and
192.168.2.10.
</p><p>
This is done on router03.example.com with IP Helper addresses. On
linux03.example.com, it's done with ISC's DHCP Relay Agent.
</p><p>
Assume router03.example.com is a Cisco Catalyst Multi-layer
Switch. Configure IP Helper addresses by entering privileged mode
(run the <tt  >enable</tt> command). Using the <tt  >ip
helper-address</tt> command,
apply the two DHCP server IP addresses to the router interface that has
the 192.168.3.1/24 address. On the Catalyst 3750G in my lab, this is
interface &ldquo;vlan20&rdquo;. The commands are applied like so:

<pre     class="programlisting">
router03#show running-config
Building configuration...

  --- output suppressed ---

interface Vlan20
 description linuxjournal_vlan
 ip address 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0
end

  --- output suppressed ---

router03#configure terminal
router03(config)#interface vlan 20
router03(config-if)#ip helper-address 192.168.1.10
router03(config-if)#ip helper-address 192.168.2.10
router03(config-if)#end
router03#copy running-config startup-config
Destination filename [startup-config]?
Building configuration...
[OK]
0 bytes copied in 8.715 secs (0 bytes/sec)
router03#show running-config interface vlan 20

Current configuration : 154 bytes
!
interface Vlan20
 description linuxjournal_vlan
 ip address 192.168.3.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 192.168.1.10
 ip helper-address 192.168.2.10
end

router03#
</pre>
</p><p>
On linux03.example.com, you need to install the isc-debian-relay
package. Once it's installed, it will ask for the &ldquo;multiple server
names be provided as a space-separated list&rdquo;. Enter
&ldquo;linux01.example.com linux02.example.com&rdquo;, or if this host isn't
configured to resolve from our DNS server pair, &ldquo;192.168.1.10
192.168.2.10&rdquo;.
It will
ask on which interface to listen. If you have no preference, leave
it blank and press Enter. It will ask you to specify additional options,
but you simply can press Enter.
</p><p>
If you make a mistake, you can reconfigure by running the command
<tt  >dpkg-reconfigure isc-dhcp-relay</tt> or modify the
<tt  >SERVERS</tt> variable in
/etc/default/isc-dhcp-relay.
</p><p>
Your DHCP clients now should be able to contact either DHCP server.
</p><p>
In Part II of this series, I'll explain how to configure OpenLDAP
on the two Linux servers and start to populate the directory with data.
