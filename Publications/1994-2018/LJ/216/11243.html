NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit</h2></div></div><p>
NVIDIA, a leading force in graphics processing units (GPUs), recently
released a major new update to the CUDA parallel computing platform. This
new version features three key enhancements that make parallel programing
with GPUs easier, more accessible and faster, improving options for
scientists and engineers seeking to advance their simulations and research.
These enhancements include a redesigned Visual Profiler with automated
performance analysis, a new and nimbler compiler based on the LLVM
open-source compiler infrastructure and hundreds of new imaging and signal-processing functions, with the latter doubling the size of the NVIDIA
Performance Primitives library. The latest CUDA release is available for
free download for Linux, Mac OS and Windows from NVIDIA's Web site.

CloudPassage's Halo NetSec</h2></div></div><p>
A survey by cloud-computing company CloudPassage found the top concern of
45% of IT managers to be a lack of perimeter defenses in their public
cloud. This lack of solutions is exacerbated by the fluctuating nature of
on-demand computing. To the rescue comes CloudPassage's new Halo NetSec, an
automated solution that provides advanced network access control for
servers running in public clouds. &ldquo;Securing cloud servers doesn't
have to be a full-time job&rdquo;, says CloudPassage. Halo NetSec
incorporates a cloud-ready firewall, two-factor authentication and an open
API for integration with other systems. It is purpose-built for the cloud
so it can scale up instantly to accommodate large development projects and
back down again. The result is &ldquo;a solution providing network security
functions expected in private data centers, enabling cloud developers and
security engineers to embrace IaaS computing with confidence&rdquo;.

Caringo Object Storage Platform</h2></div></div><p>
Got (massive unstructured) data stores? Then Caringo has something just for
you. Caringo Object Storage Platform 5.5 is the new, updated version of the
company's three-application solution that &ldquo;makes Big Data manageable
via powerful reporting, increased serviceability and massive object size
support.&rdquo; The Object Storage Platform is composed of the CAStor
object storage engine that can now store files of unknown size via chunked
encoding, as well as objects as large as 4 terabytes; the Content Router
rules-based work-flow engine for metadata-driven global replication; and the
Cluster Services Node Web-based management application. In version 5.5,
each component of the platform was upgraded, including increased service
and support functions, reporting and management capabilities, and the
aforementioned support for objects up to 4 terabytes.

Morgan Ramsay's <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gamers at Work</em></span> (Apress)</h2></div></div><p>
Tech startups fascinate us for many reasons. Among them are quirky
tech-savvy personalities, impeccable (or lucky) timing and a penchant for
garages. Morgan Ramsay's new book <span   class="emphasis"><em>Gamers at Work: Stories Behind the Games
People Play</em></span> uncovers the founding stories of the most successful and
fascinating game-company startups, including Linden Lab, Obsidian
Entertainment, Atari, Persuasive Games, Appy Entertainment and Oddworld
Inhabitants. Targeted at those considering setting up their own independent
studios, as well as those interested in the history of the video-game
industry, Ramsay's book explores the formation of entertainment software
companies from the perspectives of successful founders who risked it all.
It offers insights into why experienced professionals sacrifice the comfort
of gainful employment for the uncertainty and risk of the startup and
shares the experiences and lessons that shape the lives, decisions and
struggles of entrepreneurs in this volatile business. Will you be the next
gaming sensation, or will you crash and burn?

Digi's ConnectPort X2e for Smart Energy</h2></div></div><p>
The greener Smart Grid is coming, but scaling it will take open
architecture, lower cost and improved management of the dispersed device
network. Digi International engages these issues with the help of its new
Linux-powered ConnectPort X2e for Smart Energy gateway. The gateway
connects ZigBee Smart Energy devices from a home area network to an energy
service provider via broadband. A key advancement is the device's
additional processing power and memory, which not only permits more
efficient establishment and management of large deployments, but also
enables support for more complex local energy-efficiency applications and
the impending ZigBee Smart Energy 2.0 standard. As part of the open Digi
X-Grid Solutions, the gateway can connect to numerous types of devices to
enable a wide range of services. All Digi Smart Energy gateways feature the
iDigi Device Cloud, allowing Smart Energy devices to 
integrate energy consumption data into new and existing Smart Energy
applications easily and securely.

Opengear ACM5500</h2></div></div><p>
According to device-maker Opengear, existing tools for remote monitoring
and management tend to be complex and costly. Problem solved, says
Opengear, thanks to the firm's new Opengear ACM5500 family of customizable
remote monitoring and management gateways. The product line makes it
convenient for managed service providers to monitor and manage
their customers' network infrastructure remotely, whether on the road, in an
office or at another customer site. Customized alert thresholds
proactively track device status, and problems often can be fixed earlier
than ever, allowing for satisfied customers and avoided crises. A key
product feature is Opengear's dedicated secure hardware agent, which
gives MSPs visibility into and the ability to monitor and control
customers' network infrastructure devices even behind a firewall. Based
on open standards, the Opengear ACM5500 product family complements the
tools currently used to manage customers' IT environments (such as Cisco,
Juniper, Avaya, F5 and so on), so there is no &ldquo;rip and
replace&rdquo;.

Halon Security Router Firewall</h2></div></div><p>
The aim of the new Halon Security Router Firewall is to bring the Internet
firewall into the IPv6 age. Halon Security claims that despite the move to
IPv6 looming on everyone's doorstep, &ldquo;few firewall manufacturers
seem to focus on the greatest change in how the world communicates since the
Internet was born&rdquo;. The company's innovation is to build a custom,
OpenBSD-based OS from the ground up with a focus on IPv6, security and
performance. Core features include high-performance routing, wire-speed
throughput and hardware-accelerated AES IPSec VPN, load balancing and
failover. Customers can choose a hardware appliance, a virtualization
environment or a standard server hardware solution, all of which offer
identical security, performance and management capabilities. A free
evaluation copy is available for download from Halon Security's Web
site.

Strategic Test's i.MX283 Computer-on-Module</h2></div></div><p>
Expanding on its line of Freescale-based i.MX Computer-on-Modules,
Strategic Test recently announced the addition of the low-cost TX-28S COM
for Linux and Windows CE 6.0. The little guy measures in at 68 x 25 mm
(2.6" x 1") and contains a 454MHz i.MX283 processor coupled with
64MB DDR SDRAM, 128MB NAND Flash memory and a 200-pin SODIMM connector.
The TX-28S, says its producer, is targeted at embedded fanless applications
where low price, small size and low power consumption are critical factors.
As a member of the well-received TX family of COMs, the TX-28S allows
developers to design one baseboard that accepts different modules. This
permits protecting design against obsolescence and scalability. Strategic
Test also notes the advantage of Freescale Semiconductor's seven-year
Longevity Program, which further prevents rapid obsolescence.
