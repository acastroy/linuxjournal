LTSP5 allows thin clients to be customized unlike ever before.
This article shows you how.
</p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b2580.0x28aa358"></a></h2></div></div><p>
In my last column, I walked through the process of setting up an LTSP server
and explained the boot process for thin clients. If you need only a simple
thin-client environment consisting of a single server with a few clients,
that article is really all you need. If you want more power from
your LTSP setup, Part II of the series is where things start to get really
cool. I'm going to assume you have a basic LTSP server set up and that your
thin clients are booting successfully.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b2580.0x28aa510"></a>
The Oddly Placed Config File</h2></div></div><p>
LTSP thin clients don't need a configuration file in order to work. To
take advantage of the really cool things it can do, however, you
need to create one. The file is called lts.conf, and it lives in your tftp
root directory. For Ubuntu running 32-bit clients, this means
/var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/. Although it may seem like a strange place for a
config file to live, keep in mind that the entire LTSP chroot is converted into
an NBD block image. Changing the configuration within that image takes a
lot of work, so instead of keeping the config inside the LTSP chroot, it's
next to the kernel image and fetched during bootup from tftp. That means
any changes made to lts.conf are picked up by the thin client on reboot
without the need to re-create the chroot NBD image.
</p><p>
Oodles of configuration options can be set within
lts.conf. To get a description of them, be sure you have the ltsp-docs
package installed, and type <tt  >man lts.conf</tt> at the command line. The format
is fairly simple. Everything under the <tt  >[default]</tt> section will be applied to
all thin clients. For options pertaining only to certain devices, a new
section is created in square brackets with either the device's IP address
or the MAC address&mdash;either works. Here is my lts.conf file:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
# This is a sample lts.conf file
# It's stored in /var/lib/tftpboot/ltsp/i386/
   
[default]
VOLUME = 50
LDM_DIRECTX = True
LDM_XSESSION = "gnome-session session=classic-gnome"
CUPS_SERVER = 192.168.1.100
DNS_SERVER = 192.168.1.1
SEARCH_DOMAIN = example.com
   
# The following is a powerful thin client
[00:a4:5a:44:42:ff]
LOCAL_APPS = True
LOCAL_APPS_MENU = True
LOCAL_APPS_MENU_ITEMS = firefox,vlc,tuxtype
</pre>
</p><p>
Let's start with the <tt  >[default]</tt> section. The man page for lts.conf will
give you an explanation for all the options I've set here, but a couple aren't
obvious even after reading the description. The
<tt  >VOLUME</tt> setting is fairly
easy to understand. For some reason, the thin clients I use are maxed out
by default, and the Ubuntu login sound rattles windows and can knock out loose
dental fillings on startup. It's loud. By setting the
<tt  >VOLUME</tt> level in
lts.conf to 50, the volume is happily at half its normal level. Users can
change the level, but on every reboot, it is set back to 50%.
</p><p>
The next line is <tt  >LDM_DIRECTX</tt>. This line tells the
client to forgo the
normal encrypted connection to the server and connect directly via X. This
is less secure, but it saves on CPU load. You'll have to determine which is
more important in your environment. Keep in mind some older thin clients
will really slow down unless you set this option.
</p><p>
<tt  >LDM_XSESSION</tt> tells the thin client, or more precisely the display
manager LDM, what type of session to load. In Ubuntu 11.04, I force this to
the classic GNOME desktop. That's not an option with more recent versions
of Ubuntu, but I leave the option here so you can see it if you want to
tweak it for other less-common desktop environments.
</p><p>
The printers can be installed on each server, or if you have a central
CUPS server, you can specify it here with the
<tt  >CUPS_SERVER</tt> directive. This
makes it very simple to set up printing on multiple LTSP servers. Because
there is nothing to install, just point to the existing CUPS server, and
you're ready to go. (This also applies for local apps, which I'll cover
in a minute.)
</p><p>
The <tt  >DNS_SERVER</tt> and
<tt  >SEARCH_DOMAIN</tt> settings usually aren't needed. There
was a strange bug for years that required the settings in some
circumstances. If you have problems resolving DNS on your thin client for
whatever reason, setting these options is a good thing to try. I leave them
in out of habit more than anything; however, having them here certainly
doesn't hurt.
</p><p>
The next few lines are specified for a specific thin client. I actually
have these settings in my <tt  >[default]</tt> section and turn them off for
particularly old thin clients, but this way I can demonstrate how to apply
settings to a specific device as well. The device specified by the MAC
address will take all the <tt  >[default]</tt> settings, then apply the settings in
its section as well. It's important to note that you can override settings in
this manner. If you wanted the volume for this specified device to be 100%,
you could add <tt  >VOLUME = 100</tt> to this section. I'll refer back to the
<tt  >LOCAL_APPS</tt> declarations in the next section.

Local Apps, the LTSP Secret Sauce</h2></div></div><p>
One of the more recent issues facing thin-client proponents are
inexpensive workstations. That might seem backward, but although management
of thin clients is much nicer on a sysadmin, it's hard to convince users a
thin client is better than a $299 computer from Walmart. In fact, if you
purchase a new Atom-based thin client, it's running the same CPU and RAM a
Netbook uses, most of which run Microsoft Windows! Even low-power thin-client devices are quite powerful, so LTSP takes advantage of that
power by offloading some of the work to the thin client itself.
</p><p>
This concept is a little rough to visualize, but if you understand
tunneling X11 applications over SSH, it shouldn't be too bad. Like I
explained in Part I of this series, the local thin client loads a very
stripped-down
version of Linux over the network. It has enough to start X11 and then
connect to the server where it runs all its applications. This is sort of
like running all your applications over an SSH tunnel from a powerful
remote server. With local apps, you're still doing that, but instead of
running all apps on the server, a few of the memory/CPU-heavy ones are run
locally. For the end user, this is completely transparent. As the sysadmin,
however, you'll appreciate Firefox with Flash running on the thin client
instead of having 50 copies of Firefox with Flash running on your server.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b2580.0x28aafb8"></a>
Preparing the chroot</h2></div></div><p>
The first thing you need to do in order to use local apps is install
the apps locally! Because the NBD image is created from the chroot
environment that lives in /opt/ltsp/i386, the first step is to chroot to
that, update the apt repositories and install some apps (note that you
also mount the proc system once inside the chroot environment):
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo chroot /opt/ltsp/i386
mount -t proc proc /proc
apt-get update
apt-get install firefox adobe-flashplugin
exit
sudo umount /opt/ltsp/i386/proc
sudo ltsp-update-image
</pre>
</p><p>
A quick walk-through shows that I installed Firefox and Adobe Flash
inside the chroot. Then I exited the chroot and ran
<tt  >ltsp-image-update</tt>,
which creates a new NBD image from the chroot environment. Remember the
chroot isn't mounted directly, so changes made to the chroot take
effect only after a new NBD image is created and the thin clients are restarted.
(If you get an error about the Flash plugin not existing, you may have to
add the Ubuntu partner repository to the sources.list inside your chroot.)
</p><p>
Now that Firefox is installed locally, peek back at the lts.conf
file from earlier. The three lines look similar, but there are subtle
differences. <tt  >LOCAL_APPS</tt> is the directive that makes local apps possible.
Without this set, the thin client will always launch applications from the
server, and not its own system. <tt  >LOCAL_APPS_MENU</tt> goes one step further and
tells the thin clients it can rewrite the menu system so that specified
applications are launched from the local computer when selected from the
menu. The final directive, <tt  >LOCAL_APPS_MENU_ITEMS</tt>, tells the thin client
which applications are to be run from the local machine and not the server.
With the settings I've listed, any time a user on the specified machine
selects Firefox from the menu, it will launch Firefox as a local
application. The confusing part is that for the end user, it won't be any
different from launching it from a thin client <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> configured for local
apps. The difference is easy to tell when a lab of users starts using an
Adobe Flash site, however, because instead of 30 instances of Flash running
on the server, each thin client runs it locally.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b2580.0x28ab380"></a>
Consequences, Consequences</h2></div></div><p>
This new way of launching applications locally seems simple once you wrap
your brain around what's actually happening. It does introduce a few
frustrating things, however. Because the application (let's take Firefox as
an example) is running on the thin client, any Web plugins required will
have to be installed in the chroot. This also means printing has to be
working inside the chroot, because Firefox is running locally, in order to
print. Thankfully, that <tt  >CUPS_SERVER</tt> directive takes care of things if you
have a separate print server. If you have a locally installed printer on
the server, you need to make sure your CUPS settings allow for other
machines to connect. In that case, the thin-client local apps connect to
the server's own CUPS server to print.
</p><p>
There are other complications, like downloaded files. Where do they go?
Thankfully, the thin client automatically mounts the user's home directory
over SSH, so downloads are stored in the user's folder on the server, even
though they're downloaded with Firefox as a local app. Local apps are a
powerful way to utilize your thin client's hardware, but keeping in mind
the complications involved might help you determine when local apps are
appropriate. Sometimes, they're not.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x27b2580.0x28ab538"></a>
Just Because You Can, Doesn't Mean You Should</h2></div></div><p>
A few apps might seem logical to run as local apps to
save strain on the server. One of those apps is OpenOffice.org (or
LibreOffice in newer distros). Interestingly enough, some applications run so
well in the shared server environment, it's silly to run them as local
apps. LibreOffice is one of those. Granted, the office suite uses a lot of
resources and can hog memory, but with concurrent users, that memory
usage is shared by many, many people. In fact, once one user is running
LibreOffice, subsequent users can start the application almost instantly,
because the program is already in RAM.
</p><p>
The moral of the local app story is to identify which applications are
bogging down your server and then see how they behave as local apps. Every
LTSP release gets better and better at handling local apps, so if you were
burned several releases ago, I recommend giving it a try now.

Tips &amp; Tricks</h2></div></div><p>
<span   class="bold"><b>SSH Keys</b></span>
</p><p>
One nifty feature of the new LTSP chroot model is that it's possible to
tweak your thin client's system any way you like. For me, that includes
activating the root user and adding public key authentication for that
root user. Creating SSH keys for auto-login is something we've covered in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Linux Journal</em></span> many times before, but setting it up inside your chroot
environment might not be something you considered.
</p><p>
If you have the ability to log in to your thin client over SSH (again,
this requires installing openssh-server inside the chroot), you easily can 
reboot a thin client remotely. You also can log in and see if a particular
local app is bogging down the thin client. And, because all thin clients share
a single chroot environment, it means you can log in to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> thin client
automatically if you set up SSH keys! This means you can shut down a lab
with a single bash loop or reboot a failing thin client without ever
leaving your desk. SSH is awesome, and with LTSP,
it's easy to set up.
</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>
VNC on Clients</b></span>
</p><p>
If the ability to SSH in to a thin client is useful, the ability to
control a thin-client screen remotely is absolutely invaluable. This is
slightly more complicated, but well worth the effort (thanks to
bootpolish.net for originally posting this method).
</p><p>
Log in to chroot:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
sudo chroot /opt/ltsp/i386
mount -t proc proc /proc
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, install x11vnc:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
apt-get update
apt-get install x11vnc
</pre>
</p><p>
Next, create a vnc password file. You'll need to remember this when you
want to connect:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
echo "yourpassword" &gt; /etc/vncpassword
chmod 400 /etc/vncpassword
chown root:root /etc/vncpassword
</pre>
</p><p>
Then, you can exit the chroot:
   
<pre     class="programlisting">
Exit
sudo umount /opt/ltsp/i386/proc
</pre>
</p><p>
And the last step, which is a little tricky, is to create two files.
These files tell LDM (the thin client's display manager) to start and stop
VNC. The first file is /opt/ltsp/i386/usr/share/ldm/rc.d/I99-x11vnc:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# /opt/ltsp/i386/usr/share/ldm/rc.d/I99-x11vnc
# LDM Script to start x11vnc

XAUTH=`find /var/run/ldm-xauth* -type f`
start-stop-daemon --start --oknodo --pidfile /var/run/x11vnc.pid
&#8618;--background --nicelevel 15 --make-pidfile --exec /usr/bin/x11vnc --
&#8618;-display :7 -loop -passwdfile /etc/vncpassword -nossl -logfile
&#8618;/var/log/x11vnc -auth $XAUTH
</pre>
</p><p>
Note that the <tt  >start-stop-daemon</tt> line is one
continuous line ending with <tt  >$XAUTH</tt>.
</p><p>
The second file is
/opt/ltsp/i386/usr/share/ldm/rc.d/X99-x11vnc:


<pre     class="programlisting">
# /opt/ltsp/i386/usr/share/ldm/rc.d/X99-x11vnc
# LDM Script to stop x11vnc

start-stop-daemon --stop --oknodo --pidfile /var/run/x11vnc.pid
</pre>
</p><p>
Once created, run <tt  >sudo ltsp-update-image</tt>, and any rebooted thin clients
should be accessible over VNC using the password you created in the second
step. It's a complex setup, but definitely worth it.

Until Next Time...</h2></div></div><p>
I threw a lot of LTSP information at you in this article. If you got lost, or
felt overwhelmed, my apologies. Hopefully with a few reviews, it will all
make sense. If nothing else, I urge you to try getting local apps working.
Harnessing the power of modern thin clients is a great way to stretch your
server budget, because with the thin clients running programs like Firefox,
your server can handle many more actual thin-client connections.
</p><p>
My next column will finish up the LTSP series as I discuss
scaling. LTSP can be scaled in multiple ways, all of which have advantages
and disadvantages. The great thing about Linux is that regardless of the
number of thin clients you add, you'll never have to pay license fees!
