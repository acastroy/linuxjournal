    An examination of the issues involved with the use of open-source
    software components in closed-source applications.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14da580.0x15d24a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Use of open-source software is
mushrooming with the use of Linux. The benefits of open source are
becoming more widely known&mdash;software quality is improved from
peer-review, and future risk is reduced if the source is available.
</p><p>Open-source projects depend on contributions by motivated,
talented developers. Big, important projects like Linux attract
many contributors; a project for a software development tool may
interest a variety of software developers; UNIX systems gurus
contribute to projects for Internet tools. However, a project for
software that identifies butterflies may not attract much interest,
and the only people who are going to contribute to a project for a
company's accounts receivable system are those who are paid to do
so. Not all software benefits equally from being open
source.</p><p>The development of closed-source software will continue. As
Eric Raymond observes in &ldquo;The Magic Cauldron&rdquo;, some applications
(as opposed to operating systems and utilities) can be good
candidates for being closed-source. The owner of an application may
find more benefit in the software being secret and/or rentable than
being open source, at least for a while.</p><p>It may be undesirable for the source of a homegrown business
system to be open, because it reveals so much about the business's
procedures and capabilities. A company may want to keep the source
of its business systems confidential.</p><p>The owner of an application may want to keep the source
closed so that the software can be rented (i.e., licensed for
money). Many applications are developed only when someone believes
they can make money renting them.</p><p>While the benefits of open source are becoming more widely
appreciated, closed-source software will continue to be
developed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14da580.0x15d2768"></a>Open-Source Components in Closed-Source
Applications</h2></div></div><p>Closed-source applications can benefit from using open-source
components.</p><p>Applications generally make use of pre-existing software
components. Almost all programs use general-purpose function
libraries that come with compilers. Many applications provide a
front end using a GUI framework that comes with the compiler or a
third party. Some software uses special-purpose libraries to do
things like statistical analysis or mapping projections. Many
applications include, or know where to find, a self-contained
&ldquo;component&rdquo; that provides sophisticated functionality, such as a
database engine or a map-drawing system.</p><p>There is less risk in using a third-party component if it is
open source. This is particularly true of components developed by
small companies and individual developers. It's very difficult to
develop software components and make money renting them. People
think, &ldquo;I don't know these guys. Who knows what they've done in
there? My application depends on this functionality.&rdquo; They also
think, &ldquo;What if these guys disappear? Or find something else to
do? Or change the component so I can no longer use it? Or not fix
what I need fixed?&rdquo; They may also think, &ldquo;This component does
what I need to do now. What about next year? What if I want some
enhancements? Are these guys going to care what I want?&rdquo; Being
open source addresses these concerns. Developers can see what an
open-source component does and how it does it. They always have the
option of making improvements themselves (or paying someone to do
it).</p><p>If a component is open source, its owner cannot rent it.
However, money can be made in support services, and the people best
poised to do so are developers. A tiny outfit without the
credibility to rent a component may find that the best way to make
money is to make it open source.</p><p>It might be easier to attract contributors to an open-source
project for a component than to a project for a narrow application.
The users of a component are programmers, and they make up a
natural pool of potential contributors whereas the users of a
narrow application might be, for example, dentists.</p><p>Developers may be motivated to improve the component if an
improvement is all that is necessary for the component to be used.
Companies using the component may be motivated to spend money to
improve it.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14da580.0x15d2a28"></a>Objections to Collaborating With the
Enemy</h2></div></div><p>Concerns arise over using open-source components in
closed-source applications. The most commonly used open-source
license is the General Public License (GPL). It grants users the
freedom to modify the software and distribute this derived work
only if, among other restrictions, the derived work is also
licensed under the terms of the GPL. This license ensures that all
users of a piece of software, even users of modified versions, have
the freedom to see and modify the source code. The Free Software
Foundation promotes the use of the GPL.</p><p>A component licensed under the terms of the GPL cannot be
used in a closed-source application, but some developers of
open-source components would like to see them used in any
application, open-source or not. The Library General Public License
(LGPL, also known as the Lesser General Public License) was
developed for this situation. A component licensed under the LGPL
may be included in a closed-source application as long as users can
get the source for the component, modify it and rebuild the
application.</p><p>In many cases, however, developers of closed-source
applications cannot (or will not) make use of components licensed
under the LGPL. Developers of commercial products and companies
writing software for their own use frequently don't want any given
component badly enough to submit to the restrictions of this
license.</p><p>There are less restrictive open-source licenses. A component
licensed under the terms of the MIT License can be used by anybody
for anything. Such licensing makes a component practical to use in
closed-source development. Many people in the Open Source community
find this license to be subversive, precisely because it makes it
practical to bring open-source software into closed-source
applications.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14da580.0x15d2c38"></a>Open Source and the Hacker Culture</h2></div></div><p>The people who write open-source software are the
hackers&mdash;the community that had its origins at the MIT AI
Lab.</p><p>It began in 1959, when a group of people in the Signals and
Power group of the Tech Model Railway Club got access to a small
computer&mdash;the TX-0. This was different from the big IBM mainframe,
where one submitted a deck of punched cards, then waited around for
their own job to run. With the TX-0, one could actually sit at a
console and deal with the machine directly. The club loved it. They
loved the challenge of trying to make it do what they wanted, and
the feeling of power when it finally did. They started with
practically nothing in the way of an operating system. They wrote
their own system functions and simple tools and used them to build
better tools.</p><p>These were the original hackers&mdash;a group of people who
thought programming was the most important thing in the world. They
were explorers. They were a community. They shared information and
ideas, and they shared the belief that if information and ideas
move freely, everyone benefits. They shared the product of their
work&mdash;tools, utilities, experiments, games and jokes. A person's
standing in the hacker community was based on almost nothing except
that work.</p><p>People moved in and out of the community at MIT. Some hackers
moved to other institutions and kept in touch via the ARPA-Net (a
precursor to the modern Internet). The community became a network
community and stopped having a specific geographic location. As
Internet access became available to anyone in college, this
community grew. The Internet became the focus for many hackers; its
infrastructure was developed largely by hackers. Now the focus has
shifted to Linux, and the software that runs under it.</p><p>As Eric Raymond describes in his paper &ldquo;Homesteading the
Noosphere&rdquo;, the hacker culture is a gift culture&mdash;status within
the community is based on what a person creates and gives away.
Open-source software is the product of people programming (testing
and debugging) and giving away the results. Most of this work is
done in the spare time by people who also hold paying jobs.</p><p>People contribute to open-source projects for a variety of
reasons: fascination with the problem, desire for a meaningful
programming project, wanting to participate in the community, an
opportunity to prove themselves, or a desire to use the new
software personally. They continue to contribute to the community
and culture because it works. People who have never physically met,
each doing whatever they feel like doing, can in their spare time
create great software.</p><p>The General Public License is seen as strongly supporting the
hacker culture. It can be difficult to attract contributors to a
project for software that is not licensed under the GPL. It can be
particularly difficult for projects involving components licensed
under the MIT license.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14da580.0x15d2f50"></a>Components and the Open Source Movement</h2></div></div><p>In the past, people in the Open Source community were the
primary users of open-source software, but this has changed. Many
new Linux users are not programmers and many of them will never
contribute to open-source projects. Open-source developers don't
feel cheated by this; they feel vindicated. To a hacker, the
ultimate measure of software's worth is whether people find it
useful.</p><p>Linux has been very good for the Open Source movement. Huge
numbers of people are trying it. Many more are hearing about it.
People are pushing for its use where they work. More and more
people are learning about the Open Source movement and its values,
and becoming involved in open-source projects and a part of the
Open Source community. The community benefits from increasing use
of open-source software, whether that use directly supports
open-source development or not. The community benefits when
dentists, for instance, use Linux.</p><p>Suppose, however, that a dentist and I want to get together
and write an application that implements his top-secret super-duper
billing technique. The technique is a trade secret, so the
application must be closed source. Now, suppose that as I'm writing
it, I want to use an open-source library to do statistics. If this
makes my billing application a &ldquo;derived work&rdquo; and I'm going to
get a bunch of licensing hassles, I'll do something else. I'm not
trying to derive a new statistics library&mdash;I just want to use it.
If it's a good thing for a dentist to run his billing application
on Linux, why wouldn't it be a good thing for the application to
use open-source parts?</p><p>The more people who use open-source components, the more
people will decide some component needs a wee change and they
should do a little work for the open-source project. If open-source
components are used in business applications, businesses will, from
time to time, find it in their interest to pay someone to work on
the components. This is good for the Open Source movement.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14da580.0x15d3160"></a>Generations of the Internet</h2></div></div><p>The Internet has gone from being tiny to small to huge to
gigantic. The use of open-source software has gone from being tiny
to small to huge. The parallels between open source and the
Internet are particularly interesting, because the cultures
overlap&mdash;the infrastructure of the Internet was developed by and is
maintained by hackers.</p><p>The Internet and its culture can be viewed as having passed
through four generations:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>The U.S. Defense Department connects the ARPA-net
with other defense networks to support military research. This
proves to be a great way for researchers to communicate and share
information. Demand for networking grows, but access is limited to
a small community of computer science researchers, government
employees and government contractors. A culture based on sharing is
established.</p></li><li><p>The National Science Foundation commissions the
NSF-NET to connect colleges with five supercomputer centers. The
NSF pays for campus connections if access will be generally
available to students. Anyone at a four-year college can get on the
network. Everything still revolves around sharing; commercial use
is forbidden by the people providing the funding.</p></li><li><p>Demand for networking increases, and commercial
Internet Service Providers appear. Commercial use of the Internet
is still frowned upon (and sometimes flamed upon), but for people
and businesses paying for their own access, there is no one to
forbid it. The emphasis shifts from sharing to using&mdash;surfing,
chatting, e-mailing, browsing, finding cool stuff and being
entertained. Commercial use increases. The idea of a business
having a web site goes from being flaky to being obvious. The
original culture, with its strict mores enforcing an ethic of
sharing, is apparently losing its dominance.</p></li><li><p>Millions and millions of people are on the
Internet. You can do just about anything you want. Strict mores
have given way to true freedom. It's changing the world. More
people are sharing on the Internet than ever before. It's the
hacker spirit on a gigantic scale.</p></li></ol></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x14da580.0x15d35d8"></a>Conclusion&mdash;Closed Source as Users of Open
Source</h2></div></div><p>Linux began as an operating system used primarily by
programmers. Now it is used by all kinds of people, and the
proportion of Linux users who are programmers is steadily
decreasing. Most of these non-programmers know very little about
the traditions of the hacker culture. Many of them use Linux simply
to make money, and it's just about the best thing that could have
happened to the Open Source movement.</p><p>Open-source software isn't going to replace closed-source
software any time soon. People write closed-source applications
because they believe they can make money renting them, and they
will continue to believe this. Companies write software for their
own use, and want to guard their trade secrets.</p><p>Closed-source development is a wonderful market for
open-source components. The more companies use open-source
components, the more they will contribute to open-source
development.</p><p>It's great that programmers can create something like Linux
in their spare time, but they also spend a lot of time at their
paying jobs. Component development may be where the Open Source
movement invades company time.</p><p><a href="3893s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p><p><a href="3893s2.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p></div></div>
