    Structuring tables can improve database performance--
    here's how to do it.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2501580.0x25f95b0"></a></h2></div></div><p>Relational databases are becoming
increasingly popular for web applications. This is generally a good
thing, allowing us to focus on the way in which our data is
structured, rather than the way it is stored on disk. Offloading
data storage and retrieval tasks to a relational database server
means our programs can be smaller and easier to maintain.
</p><p>However, incorporating a database server on a web site is not
a cure-all. The database might take care of many necessary tasks,
but it cannot design your tables for you, nor determine the best
way in which to work with them.</p><p>This month, we will look at the art of database design and
how we can structure tables to improve performance. Getting the
most out of a database is something of a black art, which is why
good database administrators (DBAs) are always in high demand. But
with a few simple techniques, we can overcome some of the most
basic performance problems experienced by web programmers. We will
design a database that can handle train schedules. In so doing, we
will touch on a number of issues database programmers face when
deciding how to design tables in a database.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2501580.0x25f9768"></a>Trains and Tables</h2></div></div><p>I love trains, and often take the train between Tel Aviv and
Haifa when I must travel between those two cities. One day, after
leafing through the small paper schedule that Israel's Rail
Authority distributes, I realized the implementation of a
computerized train schedule is not as obvious as it would appear at
first.</p><p>Rail schedules often come in the form of a printed table,
with the columns representing individual trains and each station in
its own row. Each table lists trains on one rail line, in a single
direction.</p><p>Since relational databases store all of their data in tables,
you might think this is a perfect way in which to store the
information. In order to allow us to add and delete trains more
easily, we will swap the axes from the printed schedule, putting
the individual trains in the rows and the stations in the
columns.</p><p>To define such a table in SQL, we could use a query like
this:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE HaifaToTelAviv (
   haifa_central   TIME NOT NULL,
   haifa_bat_galim TIME NOT NULL,
   binyamina       TIME NOT NULL,
   hof_hacarmel    TIME NOT NULL,
   ta_central      TIME NOT NULL,
   ta_hashalom     TIME NOT NULL
);
</pre><p>Given such a table, we could enter our trains as follows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO HaifaToTelAviv
   (haifa_central, haifa_bat_galim, binyamina, hof_hacarmel,
     ta_central, ta_hashalom)
VALUES
   ("12:05", "12:10", "12:17", "12:37", "13:16",
    "13:21");
</pre>


If you have any experience with databases, you can quickly see the
terrible problems in store for us here. For starters, what happens
if a new station is built between Haifa and Tel Aviv? That would
require us to redefine our table, adding a new column, and that's
only the beginning. It is a bit absurd that each train line
requires two tables, one for each direction. And there isn't any
way for me to determine whether a particular rail line serves any
two cities&mdash;if the cities are represented by columns. What can we
do about Tel Aviv? If two cities are close to each other and I can
take a train to either one, I will have to query two tables in
order to find the answer.
</p><p>In addition, trying to query information from the above
HaifaToTelAviv table would be difficult, requiring us to know the
name of the column corresponding to each station. The problems just
continue from there&mdash;for instance, what do we enter if the express
train passes Binyamina? We could define the &ldquo;binyamina&rdquo; column to
be NULL and enter a NULL value in that column. However, NULL
normally indicates that a value is unknown or missing, whereas the
reason in this case is much simpler.</p><p>Finally, what happens if a new schedule comes out, making
each train later by a different amount of time? Editing the
schedule in this format would be quite difficult.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2501580.0x25f9b30"></a>Designing for Flexibility</h2></div></div><p>How should we model the train schedule, then, if we cannot do
so from the printed schedule? The solution is to break the
information into smaller tables, bringing them together to answer
questions. Relational databases specialize in this sort of
operation, allowing us to &ldquo;join&rdquo; two or more tables
together.</p><p>Breaking the single large table into many smaller tables
makes the database more flexible, allowing us to ask many more
questions than would otherwise be possible. For example, we should
be able to ask questions like:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>What is the last train from Haifa that will arrive
in Tel Aviv before 11:00 a.m.?</p></li><li><p>Are there any express trains from Tel Aviv to
Haifa?</p></li><li><p>What time will the 10:00 a.m. train from Binyamina
get to Tel Aviv?</p></li></ul></div><p>If we model our data correctly, breaking it down into
sufficiently small and flexible tables, it should be possible to
answer any of these questions with a single SQL query.
</p><p>These examples all use MySQL, a &ldquo;mostly free&rdquo; database
popular with many web sites. MySQL lacks some of the advanced
features of other databases, such as transactions and referential
integrity. However, it is easy to install and administer and is
extremely fast. You can learn more about MySQL at
<a href="http://www.mysql.com" target="_self">http://www.mysql.com/</a>.</p><p>For example, here is a definition of the RailStations
table:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE RailStations (
   id TINYINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   UNIQUE(name)
);
</pre><p>The only reason for RailStations to exist is to associate a
numeric ID with each station. It might seem silly to create such a
table, when we could enter station names directly wherever we need
them.
</p><p>However, giving each station an ID number gives us two
advantages. First of all, we can be sure the station names will be
spelled consistently, without variations in spelling,
capitalization and abbreviations. Second, an integer consumes less
space than the name to which it points. Each
<b  >tinyint</b> consumes a single byte, whereas a
20-character station name will consume 20 bytes. Referring to the
full name would thus consume 20 times as much RAM and disk
space.</p><p>Notice that we define <b  >id</b> to be a column of
type <b  >TINYINT&nbsp;UNSIGNED</b>. This allows us to
assign values between 0 and 255. Large rail systems, with more than
255 stations, would need to use a
<b  >SMALLINT&nbsp;UNSIGNED</b>, which ranges between 0
and 65535.</p><p>We ensure each station name in RailStations is unique by
giving it the <b  >UNIQUE</b> qualifier. The ID numbers
are already guaranteed to be unique because they have been declared
the primary key. Better yet, because we specified
<b  >AUTO_INCREMENT</b>, MySQL will automatically assign
an ID number if an INSERT query ignores it. For example:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO RailStations (name)
VALUES ("Nahariya");
</pre><p>If we now query the database:
<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT id
FROM RailStations
WHERE name = "Nahariya";
</pre>


we learn that Nahariya has been automatically assigned an ID of 1.
</p><p>We can insert one or more new rows into the table with a
single INSERT statement. For example, the following adds several
more rows to RailStations:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO RailStations (name)
VALUES ("Akko"),
       ("Hof Hacarmel"),
       ("Tel Aviv Central"),
       ("Tel Aviv Hashalom"),
       ("Lod"),
       ("Rehovot"),
       ("Herzliya")
;
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2501580.0x25fa5d8"></a>Handling Rail Lines</h2></div></div><p>Unlike cars, buses and airplanes, trains run along fixed
lines. Each line must have at least two stations, and each station
is on one or more lines.</p><p>We could have included an additional &ldquo;lines&rdquo; column in
RailStations, identifying the line with which each train is
associated. But given such a table, how would we handle stations
that sit on more than one line? It would not make sense to treat
the station as two separate stations, particularly if people will
need to switch trains.</p><p>A better solution uses a separate RailLines table, defined
similarly to RailStations:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE RailLines (
   id TINYINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
   UNIQUE(name)
);
</pre><p>Now that we have a list of lines and stations, we will create
a third table that describes the intersection between the two:
<pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE StationLines (
   station_id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
   line_id    TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
   north_to_south TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
   UNIQUE(station_id, line_id),
   INDEX(station_id),
   INDEX(line_id),
   INDEX(north_to_south)
);
</pre>


StationLines is a table that brings together the train stations and
the lines on which they sit. <b  >station_id</b> and
<b  >line_id</b> contain values from the &ldquo;id&rdquo; columns
in RailStations and RailLines, respectively. And
<b  >north_to_south</b> is an integer value that counts
the number of stops between the beginning of the line and the named
station. Thus, the northernmost station on a rail line would be
assigned 1, the next station would be assigned 2, the station after
that would be assigned 3, and so forth.
</p><p>Because each station can sit on more than one rail line, and
each rail line contains more than one station, we should not use
the <b  >UNIQUE</b> modifier with those columns. However,
we do not want the combination of any station and line to appear in
the table more than once. We enforce this by naming both
<b  >station_id</b> and <b  >line_id</b> as
arguments to <b  >UNIQUE</b>. Either of those columns may
appear multiple times, but the combination of any two values may
appear only once.</p><p>For example, the following row places <b  >station_id
1</b> as the northernmost station on <b  >line_id
1</b>:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO StationLines
   (station_id, line_id, north_to_south)
VALUES
   (1, 1, 1);
</pre><p>The following indicates that <b  >station_id 7</b>
is 11 stops from the beginning of <b  >line_id 4</b>:
<pre     class="programlisting">
INSERT INTO StationLines
   (station_id, line_id, north_to_south)
VALUES
   (7, 4, 11);
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2501580.0x29f3068"></a>Joins</h2></div></div><p>With StationLines defined, we can begin to ask the database
basic questions. For instance, we can list the stations on line
two:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT station_id
FROM StationLines
WHERE line_id = 2
ORDER BY north_to_south;
</pre><p>This query produces the following result:
<pre     class="programlisting">
+------------+
| station_id |
+------------+
|          6 |
|          4 |
|          5 |
+------------+
</pre>


While this answer is indeed correct, it is not very useful. After
all, why should I have to remember various stations' ID numbers in
order to use the system?
</p><p>Fortunately, relational databases permit us to join two
tables, allowing us to connect the station's ID number with its
name. To avoid confusing columns from the two tables, we name each
column using the <b  >table.column</b> syntax, separating
the two with a period. And to reduce the amount of typing we must
do, we give each table a nickname.</p><p>For example, we can structure our query such that it selects
information from both RailStations and StationLines:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT S.name
FROM RailStations S, StationLines L
WHERE L.line_id = 2
  AND S.id = L.station_id
ORDER BY north_to_south;
</pre><p>The query now produces the following results:
<pre     class="programlisting">
+-------------------+
| name              |
+-------------------+
| Lod               |
| Tel Aviv Central  |
| Tel Aviv Hashalom |
+-------------------+
</pre>


Beginning database programmers often make the mistake of not
qualifying their joins enough; that is, not putting enough
statements in the <b  >WHERE</b> clause. This is because
a database server produces a join by combining every row in
RailStations with every row in StationLines. The
<b  >WHERE</b> clause tells the server which rows to
remove from the resulting table.
</p><p>In the example above, the database server first creates a
table of 112 rows (8 rows in RailStations x 14 rows in
StationLines). It then removes all rows in which
<b  >L.line_id</b> is not 2, producing 24 rows. It then
applies the final criterion, throwing out those rows in which
<b  >S.id</b> and <b  >L.station_id</b> are
unequal. The result is three rows.</p><p>Because we have broken down the data into three tables and we
can join any combination of tables with any set of criteria, our
database can already help us answer some basic questions. For
example, which rail lines connect to the Tel Aviv Central station?
Knowing the ID of that station is 4, I can compose the following
query:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT L.name
FROM  RailLines L, StationLines SL
WHERE SL.station_id = 4
  AND L.id = SL.line_id;
</pre><p>That query produces the following results:
<pre     class="programlisting">
+-------------------------------+
| name                          |
+-------------------------------+
| Nahariya  - Tel Aviv          |
| Tel Aviv  - Be'er Sheva       |
| Binyamina - Tel Aviv suburban |
+-------------------------------+
</pre>


If I join a third table in my query, I can use the station's name,
rather than its ID number:
<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT L.name
FROM RailLines L, StationLines SL, RailStations S
WHERE L.id = SL.line_id
  AND SL.station_id = S.id
  AND S.name = "Tel Aviv Central";
</pre>


You might think the latter query, in which we name the station
explicitly, would be the more common and useful when designing
database applications for the Web. In fact, it's not.
&lt;select&gt; lists and other HTML form elements distinguish
between the value passed to the server and the value displayed to
the user. For example:
<pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;select name="station"&gt;
  &lt;option value="4"&gt;Tel Aviv Central
&lt;/select&gt;
</pre>


The above one-element &lt;select&gt; list gives us the best of both
worlds&mdash;it displays the station name to the user, but actually
passes the ID associated with that station. This means our query
can join two tables rather than three, which reduces the amount of
memory it uses, as well as the speed with which results are
returned to the client.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2501580.0x29f38a8"></a>Indexing</h2></div></div><p>In addition to the column definitions and the
<b  >UNIQUE</b> qualifier, our definition for the
StationLines table included three <b  >INDEX</b>
lines&mdash;one for each of the <b  >station_id</b>,
<b  >line_id</b> and <b  >north_to_south</b>
columns.</p><p>While it often helps to think of a relational database table
as a glorified spreadsheet with rows and columns, there are some
important differences. One is that a database table does not store
its rows in any particular order. If we are interested in
retrieving rows from the table in a certain order, we must specify
it with the <b  >ORDER BY</b> clause in our query.</p><p>Because rows are not ordered in any particular way, a
<b  >SELECT</b> query can often take quite a while to
fulfill. For example, take the following query:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT id
FROM RailStations
WHERE name = "Tel Aviv Central";
</pre><p>This might not seem like a time-consuming query, given that
it involves a single table and a simple <b  >WHERE</b>
clause. But since the rows of RailStations are not stored in any
particular order, finding the rows where the name is &ldquo;Tel Aviv
Central&rdquo; can take quite a while. This might be a negligible amount
of time in the case of a 100-row table, but when a table contains
1,000 or 10,000 rows, the time can become noticeable. In this
particular example, the database server is probably smart enough to
realize that RailStations.name has been declared
<b  >UNIQUE</b>, meaning our query will return one row,
if it returns anything. This means the server will, on average,
have to search through only half of the rows&mdash;but that can still
take quite a while.
</p><p>An index changes this picture by adding a pointer to each
column value. If RailStations.name is indexed, the MySQL server can
almost immediately find those rows containing a particular value.
It can also determine whether a value exists at all.</p><p>If indexes can increase query speeds so dramatically, why are
rows unindexed by default? The main answer is that indexes are
written and updated each time an <b  >INSERT</b> or
<b  >UPDATE</b> operation is performed on a table. Since
the majority of database queries are <b  >SELECT</b>s, in
which the index can substantially improve performance, this is
normally an acceptable trade-off. However, certain applications
must <b  >INSERT</b> and <b  >UPDATE</b> at
maximum speed, in which case creating an index can cause
problems.</p><p>Since indexes are used in locating columns of a certain
value, they are necessary for only those columns that will be named
in <b  >WHERE</b> clauses. There is no need to index a
column that is displayed, but rarely used as a search
criterion.</p><p>In some cases, it is enough to index the first part of each
column rather than the entire column. For example, if we are
indexing a column of type <b  >VARCHAR(50)</b>, then we
might be able to index only 10 of those characters. This will
retain most of the advantages of a full index (since the first ten
characters are rarely identical in such a text field), while
reducing the amount of information the index must store.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2501580.0x29f41f0"></a>Entering Train Information</h2></div></div><p>Now that we have thoroughly examined the tables describing
the train system, it is time to put some trains on those tracks.
The question of how to model this data is a tough one, since there
are a number of ways in which to accomplish it. I decided to split
this information into two tables, Trains and DepartureTimes.</p><p>Each row of Trains describes a particular train, indicating
the line on which it runs, the ID numbers of its origin and
destination stations, and the time it departs from its
origin:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE Trains (
  id SMALLINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  line_id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  origin_id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  destination_id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  depart_origin_time TIME NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(line_id, origin_id, destination_id,
    depart_origin_time),
  INDEX(line_id),
  INDEX(origin_id),
  INDEX(destination_id),
  INDEX(depart_origin_time)
);
</pre><p>The first column is a primary key, allowing us to describe
each train with a single number. The combination of a rail line,
origin, destination and hour should be unique, so we ask the
database server to enforce this condition with the
<b  >UNIQUE</b> keyword.
</p><p>Finally, we define the DepartureTimes table, which stores
information on when a train will leave from a particular
station:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
CREATE TABLE DepartureTimes (
   train_id SMALLINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
   station_id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
   departure_time TIME NOT NULL,
   INDEX(train_id),
   INDEX(station_id),
   INDEX(departure_time)
);
</pre><p>Once we enter information into these tables, we can start to
perform sophisticated queries. For example, which trains arrive at
&ldquo;Tel Aviv Central&rdquo; before 8 a.m.?
<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT train_id
FROM DepartureTimes
WHERE departure_time &lt; "08:00"
  AND station_id = 4;
</pre>


Sure enough, this query returns a table containing two rows:
<pre     class="programlisting">
+----------+
| train_id |
+----------+
|        1 |
|        2 |
+----------+
</pre>


Now we know two trains will arrive in Tel Aviv early enough for us
to catch a morning meeting. But which trains are those? It would be
nice to get more information than that. One possibility is to print
the name of the origin station and the hour at which the train
leaves:
<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT S.name, T.depart_origin_time
FROM DepartureTimes DT, Trains T, RailStations S
WHERE DT.departure_time &lt; "08:00"
  AND DT.station_id = 4
  AND DT.train_id = T.id
  AND S.id = T.origin_id;
</pre>


Notice how SQL allows us to use &lt; and &gt; when handling dates
and times, for columns declared as <b  >DATE</b>,
<b  >TIME</b> or <b  >DATETIME</b>. Given the
contortions one must use in order to compare dates and times in
nearly any programming language, this built-in date comparison is
still one of my favorites.
</p><p>Assuming we want to take the first train of the day
(<b  >ID 1</b>), we can print the list of when it will
arrive at each station:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT T.id, S.name, DT.departure_time
FROM RailStations S, DepartureTimes DT, Trains T,
  StationLines SL
WHERE T.id = DT.train_id
  AND T.id = 1 AND T.line_id = SL.line_id
  AND SL.station_id = DT.station_id
  AND DT.station_id = S.id
ORDER BY T.id, SL.north_to_south
;
</pre><p>We can even print a full schedule for trains to Tel Aviv
(<b  >ID 5</b>):
<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT T.id, S.name, DT.departure_time
FROM RailStations S, DepartureTimes DT, Trains T,
  StationLines SL
WHERE T.id = DT.train_id
  AND T.line_id = SL.line_id
  AND SL.station_id = DT.station_id
  AND DT.station_id = S.id
  AND T.destination_id = 5
ORDER BY T.id, SL.north_to_south
;
</pre>


Finally, we can retrieve a full schedule for trains to Tel Aviv
(<b  >ID 5</b>) that leave after 9 AM:
<pre     class="programlisting">
SELECT T.id, S.name, DT.departure_time
FROM RailStations S, DepartureTimes DT, Trains T,
  StationLines SL
WHERE T.id = DT.train_id
  AND T.line_id = SL.line_id
  AND SL.station_id = DT.station_id
  AND DT.station_id = S.id
  AND T.destination_id = 5
  AND T.depart_origin_time &gt; "09:00"
ORDER BY T.id, SL.north_to_south
;
</pre>

and retrieving information in a web application, it is not always
obvious how to go about structuring the tables in that database.
Splitting information into separate tables, as we have seen, makes
it possible to mix and match data in a wide variety of ways. By
using numeric primary keys and indexing the columns we will need
most, we can make our queries efficient as well as flexible.</p><p>Now that we have seen how to define our database tables in an
intelligent way, it is time to create some applications to use
them. Next month, we will look at a variety of applications that
