    An introduction to RTAI for deterministic and preemptive
    real-time behaviour for Linux.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14fbfa8"></a></h2></div></div><p>Before jumping headlong into our
discussion of RTAI, a quick review of what real time means and how
standard Linux relates to real time is appropriate. The term &ldquo;real
time&rdquo; can have significantly different meanings, depending on the
audience and the nature of the application in question. However,
computer science literature generally defines only two types: soft
and hard real-time systems.
</p><p>A &ldquo;soft real-time system&rdquo; is characterized by the ability
to perform a task, which on average, is executed according to the
desired schedule. A video display is a good example, where the loss
of an occasional frame will not cause any perceived system
degradation, providing the average case performance remains
acceptable. Although techniques such as interpolation can be used
to compensate for missing frames, the system remains a soft
real-time system, because the actual data was missed, and the
interpolated frame represents derived rather than actual
data.</p><p>&ldquo;Hard real-time systems&rdquo; embody guaranteed timing, cannot
miss timing deadlines and must have bounded latencies. Since
deadlines can never be missed, a hard real-time system cannot use
average case performance to compensate for worst-case performance.
One example of a hard real-time task would be monitoring
transducers in a nuclear reactor, which must use a complex digital
control system in order to avoid disaster. RTAI provides these
necessary hard real-time extensions to Linux, thus enabling it to
be targeted at applications where the timing deadlines cannot be
missed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14fc160"></a>Issues with Real-time Support in the Linux
Kernel</h2></div></div><p>RTAI provides hard real-time extensions to Linux, yet
standard Linux has support for the POSIX 1003.13 real-time
extensions, so how does the &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; capability of standard
Linux fall short?</p><p>The POSIX 1003.13 standard defines a &ldquo;Multi-User Real-Time
System Profile&rdquo; which allows for &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; processes to be
locked into memory to prevent the process from being paged to hard
disk, and a special scheduler which ensures these processes are
always executed in a predictable order.</p><p>Linux meets this standard by providing POSIX-compliant memory
lock (mlock), special schedule (sched_setsched) system calls and
POSIX RT signals. While those features do provide improved
deterministic performance, the resultant tasks cannot be defined as
hard real-time tasks, since the soft real-time process can be
blocked by kernel activity.</p><p>The standard Linux real-time POSIX API and the real-time
kernel offer dramatically distinct services, especially within a
multi-user and multi-tasking application. A simple program in
pseudo-code, shown in Listing 1, can be used to demonstrate the
system performance and issues surrounding the POSIX
approach.</p><p><a href="3838l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>This program reads the absolute time before entering a system
call which is used to suspend the process for a predetermined
interval. Next, the program reads the absolute time after the
system call returns. If the system is heavily loaded with a high
level of kernel activity, the return from the system call will be
delayed by that activity, thus the magnitude of this delay is
defined by the difference between the expected sleep time (i.e.,
100 milliseconds) and the actual sleep time.</p><p>For a standard Linux system that is idle, the above task
performance is extremely stable and the timing deviation is very
low, yielding a worst-case deviation from an average of
approximately 100 microseconds on a Pentium II 300MHz
system.</p><p>However, if the program is run on a standard Linux system,
using the same POSIX approach but with simultaneous I/O activity,
the performance dramatically deteriorates, since the facilities of
standard Linux do not allow any way for the test program to preempt
the I/O-intensive application. The average execution quickly
becomes unacceptable when, for example, one edits a very large file
and causes hard disk activity at the same time the test program is
running. This inability to preempt causes the test program to
suffer typical deviations of 30 milliseconds, and for the worst
case, in excess of hundreds of milliseconds. Consequently, standard
Linux processes using the POSIX approach cannot be used for
reliable hard real-time performance in multi-tasking
environments.</p><p>Although members of the Linux community have discussed
introducing a low-latency scheduler in future kernels to enhance
soft real-time performance, standard Linux will still fall well
short of the guaranteed response time required by a hard real-time
task.</p><p>The performance advantage of real-time Linux is easily seen
by running this same test program as a real-time task, yielding
worst case deviations of less than 12.5 microseconds regardless of
I/O activity.</p><p>Along with the scheduling benefits of the real-time kernel,
the efficiency of the real-time architecture allows Linux to run
under aggressive task iteration rates. For example, when running
this program at 500-microsecond intervals as a POSIX real-time
task, Linux stops completely. Running this program as a real-time
task leaves enough resources for Linux to continue to run.</p><p>The operating requirements of a general-purpose operating
system such as Linux are different from those of a hard real-time
system. This difference leads to other issues, summarized below,
which limit the potential for standard Linux to act as a real-time
operating system.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The Linux kernel uses coarse-grained
synchronization, which allows a kernel task exclusive access to
some data for long periods. This delays the execution of any POSIX
real-time task that needs access to that same data.</p></li><li><p>Linux does not preempt the execution of any task
during system calls. If a low-priority process is in the middle of
a <span   class="bold"><b>fork</b></span> system call and a message
is received for the video display process, then the message will
unfortunately be held in the queue until the call completes,
despite its low priority. The solution is to add preemption points
in the kernel, having the deleterious effect of slowing down all
system calls.</p></li><li><p>Linux makes high-priority tasks wait for
low-priority tasks to release resources. For example, if any
process allocates the last network buffer and a higher-priority
process needs a network buffer to send a message, the
higher-priority process must wait until some other process releases
a network buffer before it can send its message.</p></li><li><p>The Linux scheduling algorithm will sometimes give
the most unimportant and nicest process a time slice, even in
circumstances where a higher-priority process is executable. This
is an artifact of a general-purpose operating system that ensures a
background maintenance process; e.g., one that cleans up log files
and runs even if a higher-priority process were able to use all the
available processor time.</p></li><li><p>Linux reorders requests from multiple processes to
use the hardware more efficiently. For example, hard-disk block
reads from a lower-priority process may be given precedence over
read requests from a higher-priority process in order to minimize
disk-head movement or improve the chances of error recovery.</p></li><li><p>Linux will batch operations to use the hardware
more efficiently. For example, instead of freeing one page at a
time when memory gets tight, Linux will run through the list of
pages, clearing out as many as possible, which will delay the
execution of all processes. This is clearly desirable for a
general-purpose operating system, but is undesirable for real-time
processes.</p></li></ul></div><p>Real-time and general-purpose operating systems have
contradictory design requirements. A desirable effect in one system
is often detrimental in the other.
</p><p>Unfortunately, any attempt to satisfy both requirements in
the same kernel often results in a system that does neither very
well. That is not to say general-purpose functionality and
real-time determinism cannot be achieved simultaneously. In fact,
operating systems that combine these requirements exist now, and
they are indeed deterministic, preemptive and contain bounded
latencies (thus meeting the requirement for a hard real-time
system). However, the worst-case behavior for those latencies can
be unacceptably slow.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14fcc08"></a>An Introduction to RTAI</h2></div></div><p>In order to make Linux usable for hard real-time
applications, members of the Department of Aerospace Engineering,
Politecnico di Milano (DIAPM) envisioned a real-time hardware
abstraction layer (RTHAL) onto which a real-time applications
interface (RTAI) could be mounted. Unfortunately, further
investigation revealed that the Linux kernel available in late
1996, 2.0.25, was not yet mature enough for the concept.</p><p>Around the same time, a group headed by Victor Yodaiken at
the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT) in
Soccorro, NM introduced its real-time Linux (RTLinux), which
provided the DIAPM team with the opportunity to learn further about
the Linux kernel, the hardware and the modifications necessary to
provide preemptive and deterministic scheduling. The turning point
came in 1998 when the Linux 2.2.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> kernel
featured key improvements, including much-needed architectural
changes to the Linux/hardware interface. These changes, combined
with the experience gained by the DIAPM team while working with
their own evolution of the NMT-RTLinux kernel, and the concepts of
1996, resulted in RTAI.</p><p>RTAI provides guaranteed, hard real-time scheduling, yet
retains all of the features and services of standard Linux.
Additionally, RTAI provides support for UP and SMP&mdash;with the
ability to assign both tasks and IRQs to specific CPUs, x486 and
Pentiums, simultaneous one-shot and periodic schedulers, both
inter-Linux and intra-Linux shared memory, POSIX compatibility, FPU
support, inter-task synchronization, semaphores, mutexes, message
queues, RPCs, mailboxes, the ability to use RTAI system calls from
within standard user space and more.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f36a8"></a>RTAI Architecture</h2></div></div><p>The underlying architecture for RTLinux and RTAI is quite
similar. For each implementation, the Linux operating system is run
as the lowest priority task of a small real-time operating system.
Thus, Linux undergoes no changes to its operation from the
standpoint of the user or the Linux kernel, except that it is
permitted to execute only when there are no real-time tasks
executing. Functionally, both architectures provide the capability
of running special real-time tasks and interrupt handlers that
execute whenever needed, regardless of what other tasks Linux may
be performing. Both implementations extend the standard Linux
programming environment to real-time problems by allowing real-time
tasks and interrupt handlers to communicate with ordinary Linux
processes through a device interface or shared memory.</p><p>The primary architectural difference between the two
implementations is in how these real-time features are added to
Linux. Both RTLinux and RTAI take advantage of Linux's loadable
kernel modules when implementing real-time services. However, one
of the key differences between the two is how these changes, to add
the real-time extensions, are applied to the standard Linux
kernel.</p><p>RTLinux applies most changes directly to the kernel source
files, resulting in modifications and additions to numerous Linux
kernel source files. Hence, it increases the intrusion on the Linux
kernel source files, which can then result in increased code
maintenance. It also makes tracking kernel updates/changes and
finding bugs far more difficult.</p><p>RTAI limits the changes to the standard Linux kernel by
adding a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) comprised of a structure
of pointers to the interrupt vectors, and the interrupt
enable/disable functions. The HAL is implemented by modifying fewer
than 20 lines of existing code, and by adding about 50 lines of new
code. This approach minimizes the intrusion on the standard Linux
kernel and localizes the interrupt handling and emulation code,
which is a far more elegant approach. Another advantage of the HAL
technique is that it is possible to revert Linux to standard
operation by changing the pointers in the RTHAL structure back to
the original ones. This has proven quite useful when real-time
operation is inactive or when trying to isolate obscure
bugs.</p><p>Many have surmised that the HAL could cause unacceptable
delays and latencies through the real-time tasking path. In fact,
the HAL's impact on the kernel's performance is negligible,
reflecting highly on the maturity and design of the Linux kernel
and on those who contributed to its development.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f3910"></a>Real-Time Application Interface</h2></div></div><p>The HAL supports five core loadable modules which provide the
desired on-demand, real-time capability. These modules include
<span   class="bold"><b>rtai,</b></span> which provides the basic
rtai framework; <span   class="bold"><b>rtai_sched,</b></span> which
provides periodic or one-shot scheduling;
<span   class="bold"><b>rtai_mups,</b></span> which provides
simultaneous one-shot and periodic schedulers or two periodic
schedulers, each having different base clocks;
<span   class="bold"><b>rtai_shm,</b></span> which allows memory
sharing inter-Linux, between real-time tasks and Linux processes,
and also intra-Linux as a replacement for the UNIX V IPC; and
<span   class="bold"><b>rtai_fifos,</b></span> which is an adaptation
of the NMT RTLinux FIFOs (file in, file out).</p><p>Like all kernel modules, these can be loaded and unloaded
(using the standard Linux <span   class="bold"><b>insmod</b></span>
and <span   class="bold"><b>rmmod</b></span> commands) as their
respective capabilities are required or released. For example, if
you want to install only interrupt handlers, you have to load only
the rtai module. If you also want to communicate with standard
Linux processes using FIFOs, then you would load the rtai and
rtai_fifos modules. This modular and non-intrusive architecture
allows FIFOs to run on any queue and use immediate wake-ups as
necessary.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f3cd8"></a>The Real-Time Task</h2></div></div><p>The real-time task is implemented similarly to RTAI; i.e., it
is written and compiled as a kernel module which is loaded into the
kernel after the required RTAI core module(s) has been loaded. This
architecture yields a simple and easily maintained system that
allows dynamic insertion of the desired real-time capabilities and
tasks. The example below shows all that is required for a task to
be scheduled in real time:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
insmod /home/rtai/rtai
insmod /home/rtai/modules/rtai_fifo
insmod /home/rtai/modules/rtai_sched
insmod /path/rt_process
</pre><p>To stop your application and remove the RTAI:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rmmod rt_process
rmmod rtai_sched
rmmod rtai_fifo
rmmod rtai
</pre>


The facilities <span   class="bold"><b>ldmod</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>remod</b></span> may be used to load and
unload the core modules.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f3f98"></a>Task Scheduler</h2></div></div><p>RTAI's task scheduler allows hard real-time, fully preemptive
scheduling based on a fixed-priority scheme. All schedules can be
managed by timing functions and real-time events such as semaphore
acquisition, clocks and timing functions, asynchronous event
handlers, and include inter-task synchronization.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f40a0"></a>One-Shot and Periodic Scheduling</h2></div></div><p>RTAI supports both one-shot and periodic timers on Pentium
and 486-class CPUs. Although both periodic and one-shot timers are
supported, they may not be instantiated simultaneously; i.e.,
one-shot and periodic tasks may not be loaded into the kernel as
modules at the same time.</p><p>Using these timers (instantiated by rtai_sched), periodic
rates in excess of 90KHz are supported, depending on the CPU, bus
speed and chip set performance. On Pentium processors, one-shot
task rates in excess of 30KHz are supported (Pentium II, 233 MHz),
and on 486 machines, the one-shot implementation provides rates of
about 10KHz, all while retaining enough spare CPU time to service
the standard Linux kernel.</p><p>The limitation of rtai_sched to support simultaneously
one-shot and periodic timers is mitigated by the MultiUniProcessor
(MUP) real-time scheduler (rtai_mups), which provides the
capability to use, simultaneously, both a periodic and a one-shot
timer or two periodic timers with different periods, at a
performance equivalent to that noted above under rtai_sched. Note
that, since the MUP uses the APIC (advanced programmable interrupt
controller) timer, it cannot operate under SMP and requires each
MUP-scheduled task to be locked to a specific CPU (thus the
MultiUniProcessor designation); however, the MUP retains all
coordination and IPC services, so that no other capabilities are
lost.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f4258"></a>Floating-Point Operations</h2></div></div><p>Floating-point operations within real-time tasks/ISRs
(interrupt service routines) are possible, provided these tasks are
marked, upon loading, as tasks which require the FPU. This method
provides real-time task access to the FPU while still allowing FPU
access to standard Linux tasks.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f4360"></a>Interrupt Handling</h2></div></div><p>RTAI provides efficient and immediate access to the hardware
by allowing, if one chooses, interaction directly with the
low-level PC hardware, without first passing through the interrupt
management layers of the standard Linux kernel.</p><p>The ability to individually assign specific IRQs to specific
CPUs, as described in further detail below, allows immediate,
responsive and guaranteed interface times to the hardware.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f44c0"></a>Inter-Process Communication</h2></div></div><p>The term inter-process communication (IPC) describes
different ways of message passing between active processes or
tasks, and also describes numerous forms of synchronization for the
data transfer.</p><p>Linux provides standard system V IPC in the form of shared
memory, FIFOs, semaphores, mutexes, conditional variables and pipes
which can be used by standard user processes to transfer and share
data. Although these Linux IPC mechanisms are not available to do
real-time tasks, RTAI provides an additional set of IPC mechanisms
which include shared memory, message queues, real-time FIFOs,
mutexes, semaphores and conditional variables. These are used to
transfer and share data between tasks and processes in both the
real-time and Linux user-space domains.</p><p>RTAI's remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism is similar in
operation to QNX messages available to real-time tasks, and
transfers either an unsigned integer or a pointer to the
destination task(s).</p><p>The RTAI mailbox implementation provides the ability to send
any message from user space to real-time tasks, real-time tasks to
real-time tasks, and user tasks to user tasks (using LXRT) via any
definable mailbox buffer size. Multiple senders and receivers are
allowed, where each is serviced according to its priority.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f46d0"></a>proc Interface</h2></div></div><p>From version 0.9, RTAI includes a proc interface which gives
useful information on the current status of RTAI, including
schedulers loaded; real-time tasks activity, priority and period;
and FIFOs in use and their associated buffer sizes. The development
of even more features is currently underway.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f47d8"></a>SMP Support</h2></div></div><p>RTAI provides true support for symmetric multi-processing
(SMP) architectures through its task and IRQ management.</p><p>By default, all tasks are assigned to run on any CPU (of a
SMP platform). Each task, however, can be individually assigned to
any CPU subset, or even to a single CPU. Additionally, it is
possible to assign any real-time interrupt service to any specific
CPU. Because the ability to force an interrupt to a specific CPU is
not related to the SMP scheduler, RTAI retains the flexibility to
perform these two operations independently.</p><p>These capabilities provide a method of statically optimizing
the real-time application, if manual task distribution handles the
task more efficiently than the automatic SMP load-distribution
services of Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f4990"></a>Linux-RT (LXRT)</h2></div></div><p>Since real-time Linux tasks are implemented as loadable
modules, they are, for all practical purposes, an integral part of
the kernel. As such, these tasks are not bounded by the memory
protection services of Linux, and they have the ability to
overwrite system-critical areas of memory, bringing the system to
an untimely halt. This limitation has been a large frustration to
those of us who have erred during real-time task
development.</p><p>RTAI's LXRT solves this problem by allowing the development
of real-time tasks, using all of RTAI's hard real-time system calls
from within the memory-protected space of Linux and under a
&ldquo;firm&rdquo; real-time service. When the developer is satisfied with a
task's performance within LXRT, the task is simply recompiled as a
module and inserted into the kernel (along with the associated
modules which provide RTAI's real-time features) to transition from
firm to hard real-time.</p><p>LXRT's firm real-time service, similar to that offered by the
Kansas University Real-Time (KURT) patch, provides soft real-time
combined with fine-grained task scheduling. Performance under LXRT
is quite good, yielding latencies not much greater than for a
standard Linux system call leading to a task switch. Although this
is very valuable as a development tool, we should not lose sight of
the fact that RTAI's firm real-time implementation can prove
especially useful for those tasks which don't require hard
real-time, but yet are not quite satisfied with the scheduling
performance of standard Linux.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f4b48"></a>POSIX Compatibility API</h2></div></div><p>RTAI implements a compliant subset of POSIX 1003.1.c through
the use of a single loadable module. These calls support creation,
deletion, attribute control and environment control for threads,
mutexes and condition variables. The resultant POSIX support is
similar to standard Linux threads, except that parent-child
functions (which are not appropriate for real-time tasks, since all
threads are considered to be part of a single process) and signal
handling (which is currently in development) are not
supported.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f4c50"></a>Typical Performance</h2></div></div><p>RTAI is now competitive from both a cost and performance
perspective with the commercial RTOS currently available.</p><p>Since the performance of any RTOS system is determined by the
performance of the RTOS itself, the performance of the hardware on
which it is running, and the test procedure used to acquire the
data, absolute performance figures are very difficult to quantify,
often making comparisons difficult between fundamentally similar
RTOSes. However, the data below was measured on, and is
representative of, typical Pentium II 233MHz and 486
platforms.</p><p>For these performance characterizations, an early version of
the RTHAL module was demonstrated running a timer at 125KHz
(Pentium II, 233MHz) while simultaneously servicing Linux, which
was working under a heavy load. During this demonstration, the
average and maximum jitters about the periodic timer were
0&lt;\#181&gt;s and 13&lt;\#181&gt;s, respectively. This
performance, combined with additional tests, can be summarized in
this way:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Maximum periodic task iteration rate: 125KHz</p></li><li><p>Typical sampling task rate: 10KHz (Pentium
100)</p></li><li><p>Jitter at maximum task iteration rate:
0-13&lt;\#181&gt;s UP, 0-30&lt;\#181&gt;s SMP</p></li><li><p>One-shot interrupt integration rate: 30KHz
(Pentium-class CPU), 10KHz (486-class CPU)</p></li><li><p>Context switching time: approximately
4&lt;\#181&gt;s</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1403580.0x14f51d0"></a>Future Developments</h2></div></div><p>RTAI continues to grow and mature through the combined
contributions of the DIAPM development team and those across the
Internet who are encouraged by RTAI's flexible architecture, high
performance and feature set. While this real-time Linux extension
is very capable, stable and mature today, work is far from
finished. The future holds many things, including:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>VxWorks compatibility libraries</p></li><li><p>pSOS compatibility libraries</p></li><li><p>Enhanced development tools</p></li><li><p>Enhanced debug tools</p></li><li><p>Real-time Ethernet functionality</p></li></ul></div><p><a href="3838s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a>

the current performance and feature sets of RTAI and RealTime
Linux. However, the RTAI and Zentropix home pages always contain
