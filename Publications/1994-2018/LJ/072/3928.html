simple, but highlights many of the strengths and flexibilities of
Linux, which we believe are especially important in the era of
Internet-centric computing. To make this a more complete
description of the several technologies related to &ldquo;differentiated
services&rdquo;, we include some background material on the purpose and
structure of Diffserv as well as highlights of other, more complex
implementations of Diffserv environments which have benefitted from
the sophistication of the Linux kernel.
</p><p>Although our implementation of a Diffserv environment is
fairly straightforward, we feel it's also interesting for these
reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>We use an approach that allows reconfiguration of
the entire network instantaneously and on-demand from a &ldquo;network
management workstation&rdquo;. This was a key component of our
environment, because one of our main goals was to demonstrate
concisely, for a non-technical audience, using real-time
applications, the &ldquo;before-after&rdquo; effects of a Diffserv-enabled
network.</p></li><li><p>We developed this environment supported, in part,
by one of the major Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) and
by the National Science Foundation through a &ldquo;Research Experiences
for Undergraduates&rdquo; (REU) supplement to an existing NSF grant. As
such, the system configurations, software and most of the
architecture was developed primarily by undergraduate engineering
students at our university.</p></li></ul></div><p>Our demonstration environment has been used for live,
hands-on demonstrations at two large regional meetings: the
Southeastern Universities Research Association (SURA) Applications
Workshop (Sept. 1999) and the Bellsouth Science &amp; Technology
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Innovations Showcase</em></span> (Oct. 1999).
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bbdf0"></a>Diffserv: Some Important Background</h2></div></div><p>The key to &ldquo;service differentiation&rdquo; (or Quality of
Service, QoS) in the Internet is the way routers handle (or can be
easily modified to handle) multiple classes of traffic with various
requirements for transport. The term &ldquo;Diffserv&rdquo; refers to an
approach for implementing such capabilities which is being defined
(through the usual method of constructing Internet standards) to be
broadly compatible with the scope and flavor of the global Internet
(see Resources 1).</p><p>The architecture of Diffserv can be viewed in terms of
relatively simple functional units in the Internet's &ldquo;forwarding
nodes&rdquo; (routers) (see Resources 2). The simplicity of Diffserv is
important because, in theory, it has the potential to provide
coarse differentiation between types of Internet traffic without
requiring a fundamental change to the current configuration of the
Internet.</p><p>One of the functional units described by Diffserv is a set of
&ldquo;per-hop behaviors&rdquo; (PHBs). The idea behind PHBs is to let each
router easily and quickly classify packets into different types of
output queues based on a &ldquo;tag&rdquo; embedded in the packet header.
Square tags go in &ldquo;square&rdquo; queues. Round tags go in &ldquo;round&rdquo;
queues. Packets in the &ldquo;square&rdquo; queue get treated differently
than packets in the &ldquo;round&rdquo; queue.</p><p>The scheme works in much the same way airline passengers are
allowed to check bags or board the plane: &ldquo;first class&rdquo; goes
first, &ldquo;coach class&rdquo; is next, and &ldquo;standby&rdquo; is last if there's
enough room. There are also other functional units in Diffserv
which are often called <span   class="emphasis"><em>packet classification</em></span>
and <span   class="emphasis"><em>traffic conditioning</em></span>. In keeping with the
airline analogy, packet classification is akin to the act of
purchasing a type of ticket (or having one assigned to you, based
on some rules) and traffic conditioning is like the disturbances
(e.g., bumping and rerouting) experienced by a group of passengers
when a flight is canceled or delayed. For our demonstration
environment, we focus primarily on the PHBs and differences between
particular classifications of traffic when the network is
congested. To put it another way, we essentially ask the following
questions: &ldquo;Is first class <span   class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> better than
coach?&rdquo; and &ldquo;How can I tell?&rdquo;</p><p>In Diffserv, the &ldquo;first class&rdquo; designation is called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>expedited forwarding</em></span> (EF) (see Resources 3).
The idea of EF is to simulate a &ldquo;virtual leased line&rdquo; by ensuring
minimal queuing of packets within each router along the transport
path. As such, the EF class hopes to provide
<span   class="emphasis"><em>guarantees</em></span> on delay and jitter, which are
important for isochronous data streams (i.e., video and audio).
This is one of Diffserv's weak points, in our opinion. Due to an
explicitly designed inability to distinguish between individual
traffic streams, the <span   class="emphasis"><em>aggregate</em></span> EF flow
receives the desired treatment. There can be no &ldquo;hard promises&rdquo;
made to individual flows unless there are <span   class="emphasis"><em>very
few</em></span> EF flows. This result has been noted with some
chagrin in many publications (see Resources 4). The effect of EF
classification is the presence of high amounts of jitter between
subsequent packets in individual streams. As a result of the stated
goals and the architecture of Diffserv, the only way to minimize
these effects is to practice &ldquo;gross overprovisioning&rdquo;, where only
a small percentage of the available bandwidth is made available to
the EF class, and only a few EF streams are allowed. In the airline
analogy, the number of first-class passengers on any flight would
have to be limited strictly to a tiny proportion of the available
seats. Otherwise, the flight attendants wouldn't be able to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>guarantee</em></span> good service.</p><p>The &ldquo;coach class&rdquo; designation in Diffserv is called
<span   class="emphasis"><em>assured forwarding</em></span> (AF) (see Resources 5) and
is a bit more complicated than EF. The complication of AF is
primarily due to the fact that there are four different classes of
AF, and each class has three subtypes. The difference between AF
classes is related to different levels of &ldquo;forwarding
assurances&rdquo;. The difference between subtypes in each AF class is
related to different levels of &ldquo;drop precedence&rdquo; or relative
importance within the class (i.e., low, medium, high).</p><p>The relationship between &ldquo;class&rdquo; and &ldquo;drop precedence&rdquo; is
subtle. Each class is allocated resources (such as buffer space,
bandwidth and so on) at each forwarding node (router). These
resources comprise a level of &ldquo;assurance&rdquo; that packets from each
class will be forwarded as desired. Transmissions can
<span   class="emphasis"><em>exceed</em></span> these resources at their own peril,
described by the &ldquo;drop precedence&rdquo;. So, within the AF
designation, forwarding depends on the relationships between the
instantaneous traffic load at a router, the &ldquo;available&rdquo; resources
compared to the &ldquo;desired&rdquo; resources and the drop precedence of
each packet.</p><p>The &ldquo;standby class&rdquo; designation in Diffserv is the
well-known <span   class="emphasis"><em>best effort</em></span> (BE) behavior of the
current Internet. So, coarse differentiation between service levels
is made by classifying packets as BE (poor), AF (better with
conditions) or EF (best).</p><p>As a result of the functional unit architecture of Diffserv,
and in an effort to push per-stream complexity to the
<span   class="emphasis"><em>edge</em></span> of the network, there are actually at
least two different types of routing/forwarding nodes in a Diffserv
domain. According to the Diffserv specification, &ldquo;edge&rdquo; routers
use a (possibly complex) set of rules to insert tags into the
header of each IP packet. These tags are called &ldquo;Diffserv Code
Points&rdquo; or DSCP (see Resources 6). Once the packets have been
tagged and admitted into the interior of the Diffserv domain,
&ldquo;core&rdquo; routers simply have to examine each packet's DSCP and
assign it to the corresponding output queue to be forwarded on to
the next node. With proper network architecture, each packet should
be able to consume the forwarding resources it needs and is
entitled to as a result of its &ldquo;tag&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bc5d8"></a>Linux Support for Diffserv Capabilities</h2></div></div><p>The ability to implement advanced routing behavior using
Linux, including those proposed by Diffserv, is provided by the
rich set of traffic-control features present in the Linux kernel.
Alexey Kuznetsov is the author of these kernel features and the
user-space programs used to control them. The architecture of the
Linux traffic control features is described nicely by Almesberger
(see Resources 7), and the motivation and control of these features
is also summarized in an excellent <i  >LJ</i> article
by Hadi-Salim (see Resources 8). For clarity, we include a brief
review of the Linux traffic-control capabilities used in our
implementation and our approach to configuring them. In general, to
enable &ldquo;differentiated services&rdquo; for Linux, first the Linux box
has to be able to route IP packets correctly, and several rules for
traffic control must then be put in place.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bc738"></a>Kernel Configuration</h2></div></div><p>In preparation for use as a Diffserv router, the kernel of
the Linux router must be configured to allow the use of advanced
routing features. To implement Diffserv-type behaviors effectively,
several &ldquo;subsystems&rdquo; of the kernel must be available. These
subsystems include the routing capabilities of the kernel, the
packet scheduling functions, and the netlink functionality to
configure the traffic-control modules. The traffic-control
functions can be compiled into a monolithic kernel or loaded as
modules.</p><p><a href="3928l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p><a href="3928l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>A summary of the pertinent features compiled into our
Diffserv routers is shown in Listings 1 and 2. All locations given
are representative of the option list given during
<b  >make  menuconfig</b>. You may be checking your
kernel configuration menu now, and saying to yourself, &ldquo;Hmm... I
don't see those choices!&rdquo; That's because you haven't acquired the
necessary kernel patch. The web site for &ldquo;Differentiated Services
on Linux&rdquo; is maintained by Werner Almesberger at the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology (see Resources 9). Here you will find the
&ldquo;Diffserv for Linux&rdquo; distribution (as of this writing, the
current version was ds-6). The distribution comes with a set of
patches for both the kernel and for a user-space application to
configure traffic-control kernel features (called &ldquo;tc&rdquo;). Also
included in the distribution is a set of example scripts and some
documentation. It is a good idea to acquire a copy of the package
<span   class="bold"><b>iproute2+tc</b></span> at this point (see
Resources 10). The patch from the Linux Diffserv distribution is
version-sensitive with iproute2+tc, and since our project took
place mainly in the summer of 1999, we used version ss990630 of
iproute2+tc.</p><p>Once your Linux router has been configured properly
(depending on your router's job), you are ready to configure your
machine for traffic control.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x21bcb00"></a>Traffic-Control Configuration</h2></div></div><p>To enable differentiated services on a Linux router, the
traffic-control features must be configured. This configuration is
achieved through a user-level program, appropriately named
<span   class="bold"><b>tc</b></span> (traffic control). The
command-line syntax for tc is quite long and complex, so scripts
are generally used for configuration. An example tc configuration
script is shown in Listing 3. In the listing, tc is being used to
configure kernel traffic control for a core router in our Diffserv
application. This entails attaching a parent queuing discipline to
the applicable interface, then creating the queues for the varying
classes of traffic. Finally, filters are created to classify
packets into the appropriate classes.</p><p><a href="3928l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>As can be seen in Listing 3, the structure of the tc
configuration scripts for a Diffserv-enabled Linux router can be
broken down into parts:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Creation of the root queuing discipline. This uses
the syntax <b  >tc&nbsp;qdisc&nbsp;add</b> followed by
several parameters. These parameters describe attributes of this
queuing discipline. These parameters include which network
interface the queuing discipline is attached to (<b  >dev
eth3</b>), an identifier for
<span   class="bold"><b>qdisc</b></span> (<b  >handle
1:0</b>), where in the qdisc hierachy to insert this qdisc
(<b  >root</b>) and which queuing discipline to use
(<b  >tcindex</b>). The remaining parameters are specific
to the particular queuing discipline. Diffserv maps naturally into
a class-based queuing scheme. Therefore, each Diffserv router
(regardless of job) will employ class-based queuing
(<b  >CONFIG_NET_SCH_CBQ</b>) to house its various
per-hop behaviors.</p></li><li><p>Creation of classes for each type of per-hop
behavior. This uses the syntax
<b  >tc&nbsp;class&nbsp;add</b> followed by several
parameters. These parameters are similar to the
<b  >tc&nbsp;qdisc&nbsp;add</b> syntax. These parameters
will identify which queuing discipline the class belongs to, and
other parameters define the behavior of the class. Our
demonstration made extensive use of two per-hop behaviors: best
effort (BE) and expedited forwarding (EF). The configuration in
Listing 3 clearly shows the two sections defining BE and EF
PHBs.</p></li><li><p>Creation of queuing disciplines for each class.
Each class must have a queuing discipline to determine how packets
are enqueued and dequeued. The syntax for this step is identical to
that for step 1. The EF PHB class uses a simple FIFO (first-in,
first-out) for its queuing discipline, since we wanted the traffic
to get in and out of the class as quickly as possible. The BE PHB
class uses a token bucket filter in an attempt to throttle the
traffic-generation machines during times of extreme
congestion.</p></li><li><p>Creation of filters (classifiers) to assign marked
traffic to the appropriate class. This uses the syntax <b  >tc
filter add</b> followed by several parameters used to
describe which packets are bound for what classes. Our sample
script is from a core router. Packets arriving at this interface
have already been marked by edge routers. Classifying packets at
this step requires matching the TOS (type of service) bits from the
IP header to values suggested by the IETF (Internet Engineering
Task Force) Differentiated Services workgroup for various per-hop
behaviors (denoted by the value following the &ldquo;mask&rdquo; parameter).
The filter creation varies, based on which job the router fulfills.
Core routers solely use the
<span   class="bold"><b>tcindex</b></span> packet classifier
(<b  >CONFIG_NET_CLS_TCINDEX</b>) included with the
Diffserv distributions. Edge routers use the firewall packet
classifier (<b  >CONFIG_NET_CLS_FW</b>) along with
<span   class="bold"><b>ipchains</b></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>Complete Diffserv functionality really assumes two different
types of routing capabilities: &ldquo;core&rdquo; and &ldquo;edge&rdquo; routers. With
a Linux-based Diffserv implementation, &ldquo;edge&rdquo; routers use
ipchains to handle their tasks. Replacing the application
<span   class="bold"><b>ipfwadm</b></span> from earlier kernels,
ipchains is a user-space program that configures the firewalling
functionalities of Linux kernels 2.1.<span   class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and
higher. Configuring ipchains has been well-documented in this
magazine (see Resources 11) and other arenas, and is beyond the
scope of this document. Our Linux Diffserv testbed uses ipchains to
assign handles to incoming traffic based on IP address rules. These
handles are then used by a filter (classifier) installed with tc
(the user-space application) to replace the current IP TOS
bytefield setting with the appropriate Diffserv field marking
(DSCP). This method proved to be very effective. Dynamic
configuration was easily attainable, and the speed of ipchains held
up to very high demand. Even though ipchains will be superceded by
<span   class="bold"><b>iptables</b></span> in future versions of the
Linux kernel (see Resources 12), the functionality will be very
similar. So, the approach we've used will still be applicable.
</p><p>The specific scripts used to provide Diffserv capability in
our testbed environment are available at
<a href="ftp://cter.eng.uab.edu/Diffserv" target="_self">ftp://cter.eng.uab.edu/Diffserv/</a>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x25b59b0"></a>A Diffserv Environment</h2></div></div><p>The ability to change router configurations on the fly in our
&ldquo;demonstration environment&rdquo; is achieved via a web-based network
management console which uses JavaScript bundled with Dynamic HTML.
The network administrator can interact with this interface to
initiate various levels of traffic priority. We use this to
simulate a service-level agreement (SLA) between the network
provider and the end user.</p><p>A goal of our demonstration environment, in addition to
concisely demonstrating the effect of differentiated services, was
to prove that the queuing mechanisms within the Linux Diffserv
implementation were robust enough to enforce various SLAs
throughout our Diffserv domain. As shown in Figure 1, the domain
was composed of three routers (one core router, two leaf routers),
two Litton CAMVision-2 MPEG-2 codecs (up to 15Mbps) or two Vbrick
MPEG-1 codecs (up to 3Mbps), two client workstations, one web
server and one network management workstation (NMS).</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3928f1.large.jpg"><img src="3928f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>Figure 1. The General Architecture of Our Diffserv
Domain and a</p></div></div>
</p><p>In the figure, the classification of traffic is performed by
the leaf routers &ldquo;obiwan&rdquo; and &ldquo;nimitz&rdquo;, and the core router
&ldquo;quigon&rdquo; is configured for the corresponding DSCP-based
forwarding and queueing. The traffic streams are color-coded to
correspond to particular types of PHBs (blue=BE, red=EF and so on).
Notice from the figure that the link between quigon and nimitz is
10 MBps Ethernet and is consistently
<span   class="emphasis"><em>oversubscribed</em></span> with multiservice traffic. This
is the situation where differentiation between SLAs is critical. To
make sure the instantaneous change between SLAs was clearly visible
to the casual observer, we used the MPEG video stream as well as
some interactive, web-based streaming media (RealAudio, RealVideo,
etc.).</p><p>In order to simulate the dynamic nature of the signaling
between the network administrator and each of the routers, we
decided to use a socket interaction. When the network administrator
wishes to configure a certain service level, he accesses the web
interface via the NMS. By using JavaScript, DHTML and GIFs with
transparent sections within the page, we were able to present the
administrator with a visual representation of the desired SLA
before actually committing to it. This is shown in the screenshot
of Figure 1 as the collection of color-coded traffic streams
between the end points.</p><p>As shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, we were able to configure
several service levels with our approach, each of which was
available via a single mouse click. Note that the values and
configurations shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 reflect a particular
set of SLAs which used only BE and EF traffic classes. When the
user clicks on the desired SLA icon, the value from the HTML form
field is passed to the web server via an HTTP
<span   class="bold"><b>POST</b></span> operation. The form values
are passed via CGI to a Perl script that processes the POST, then
reconfigures each router in the domain. The routers are contacted
one by one, and the SLA chosen by the administrator is invoked.
Sample Perl pseudocode for the client portion of router control is
shown in Listing 4, and the server portion is shown in Listing 5.
As can be seen from the Perl client code in Listing 4, the NMS (or
other web server) can easily pass the &ldquo;current SLA&rdquo; to all
routers in the domain based on input from the network manager. This
&ldquo;control channel&rdquo; interface was protected in all network
configurations by a high-priority, low-rate queuing configuration,
shown as the black line in Figure 1.</p><p><a href="3928l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p><a href="3928l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p><p>To provide positive user feedback at the NMS, the web
interface is refreshed for the administrator while each router
begins its unique network setup. Each Diffserv-enabled router in
the domain receives the desired SLA and must set up its rules
accordingly, depending on its position within the domain and the
collection of statically defined SLAs. This is done dynamically via
a <span   class="bold"><b>system</b></span> call to
<span   class="bold"><b>ipchains-restore</b></span> according to the
new SLA. When the ipchains-restore command finishes, the network
setup is complete. The Perl pseudocode for this operation is shown
in Listing 5 for a typical core router. As our system is defined,
we maintain essentially a simple &ldquo;database&rdquo; of network/SLA
configurations in pre-stored ipchains mappings.</p><p>To attempt to simulate some typical end-user traffic in
addition to the constant MPEG stream, we used a number of FTP
downloads, some streaming audio/video sources and a small flood
ping throughout the network. Due to the interactive nature of our
demonstration environment, these network-based data sources were
also available &ldquo;on demand&rdquo; from a web-based GUI.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x25b6198"></a>Other Linux-based Diffserv Work</h2></div></div><p>It would be inappropriate, particularly with respect to any
open-source developments, to neglect mentioning related efforts, or
efforts which have contributed to the system described in this
article. Two Linux-based Diffserv projects we feel are especially
interesting and mature are the efforts underway at the University
of Karlsruhe (see Resources 13) and the University of Kansas (see
Resources 14). Many of the conclusions and insights made available
through these projects correspond with our own observations, and
they are excellent sources of further information on Diffserv and
differentiated services under Linux. We highly recommend them to
the interested reader.</p><p>In particular, we want to call attention to the differences
between the demonstration environment described in this article and
the DiffSpec tool under construction at the University of Kansas.
The Diffserv approach to resource allocation for each class of
service very explicitly requires external intervention in the form
of what has been called a &ldquo;bandwidth broker&rdquo; (BB). The DiffSpec
tool entails a much grander system concept than the demonstration
environment discussed here. For example, DiffSpec includes an API
for managing queue/class/filter combinations, CORBA-based system
calls for automated configuration of DS parameters, and a general
web-based user interface to the Linux traffic-control
capabilities.</p><p>In contrast, for the purpose of our demonstration
environment, we unwittingly followed a &ldquo;separation of powers&rdquo;
philosophy well known to students of political science. We
carefully segregated the &ldquo;service level definition&rdquo; (or
&ldquo;legislative branch&rdquo;) functions of the BB into a manually
crafted, static database of allowable configurations. At the same
time, we placed the &ldquo;network instantiation&rdquo; (or &ldquo;executive
branch&rdquo;) functions of the BB onto a cleverly distributed
arrangement of ipchains rules. In this fashion, we are able to
reconfigure the entire network instantly to one of several
predefined &ldquo;looks&rdquo; through either an operator's input or by an
automated means. This approach may be scalable in some contexts,
and it may provide for convenient &ldquo;governance&rdquo; of network
resources, but it was not specifically intended for mass
consumption.</p><p>Additionally, the structure of the Karlsruhe Diffserv
implementation seems to be somewhat different than the
implementation maintained by Werner Almesberger at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. For our project, we
used Almesberger's distribution, so we don't have specific
experience with the Karlsruhe distribution or the differences
between the two implementations.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x20c3580.0x25b63a8"></a>Conclusions</h2></div></div><p>In reviewing the architecture and explicit results provided
by the K.I.D.S. project (see Resources 4), we agree with their
conclusions regarding strengths and weaknesses of Diffserv. In
particular, through the use of our &ldquo;before-after&rdquo; scenario for
configuring a Diffserv domain, we have experienced first-hand
corroboration of these factors in the context of our &ldquo;real
applications&rdquo;.</p><p>We also agree with Metz, who states (see Resources 1) that
&ldquo;In the long run it will most likely be a combination (of
technologies) that will enable the Internet to offer QoS.&rdquo; When
the long run materializes, we're confident that Linux will be a
part of the solution, because QoS in the Internet is definitely
&ldquo;where you want to go tomorrow&rdquo;.</p><p><a href="3928s1.html" target="_self">Acknowledgements</a></p><p><a href="3928s2.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>

          is a Linux
          enthusiast who happens to be employed in the UAB Dept. of
          Electrical and Computer Engineering. When he isn't &ldquo;playing
          Professor&rdquo; by hustling research money or teaching classes, he can
          be found wandering around, pestering students for &ldquo;interesting results&rdquo;
