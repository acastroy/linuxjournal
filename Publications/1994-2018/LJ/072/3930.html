    AOL Time Warner makes Microsoft look like the corner store.
    --John Katz
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1d07580.0x1dff5b0"></a></h2></div></div><p> The AOL/Time Warner deal is the &ldquo;News
that Won't Go Away&rdquo;. Almost overnight, Microsoft became a
non-issue. Some commentators even began to see Bill Gates as a
sympathetic figure, like Caesar in his last days. Suddenly, we had
new Caesars to worry about: AOL's Steve Case and Bob Pittman. The
feds could shatter Microsoft into a dozen Baby Bills (or Baby
Borgs), and everyone would still be wondering if AOL could actually
pipe-weld the Net to the rusty back end of TV's history.
</p><p>Break up Microsoft? Like, so what? All the pieces will still
be caught in the Net, and more than half the people who log on have
@aol.com addresses. Which is creepier: a crashy OS, or a giant ISP
that dumbs down the Net?</p><p>Well, are we going to do something about that? Can we?
Slashdot's Jon Katz thinks the situation could hardly get worse.
&ldquo;There is no way for innovators or entrepreneurs to challenge
it,&rdquo; Katz writes about the AOL/Time Warner deal. &ldquo;No one can
compete with the software, the cheap access, the wide range of
content. This company is bigger than many countries.&rdquo; How big,
exactly? Let's take a look at what Time Warner brings to the
table:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Publishing: Time Inc. has 33 magazines, including
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Time</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Life</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>People</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Southern Living</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>In Style</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Sports
Illustrated</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Parenting</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Money</em></span>, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Health</em></span>,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Sunset</em></span> and <span   class="emphasis"><em>Fortune</em></span>.
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Time</em></span> alone accounted for more than 1/5 of all
revenue generated by consumer magazines in 1998. Little Brown,
Sunset Books and other Time imprints account for dozens of
best-selling books every year.</p></li><li><p>Cable: CNN, TBS and HBO each have multiple
channels, enormous production operations and massive libraries of
programs. Then there is Time Warner Cable, which serves 21.3
million homes.</p></li><li><p>Motion pictures: Warner Brothers has 5,700 feature
films, 32,000 television shows and 13,500 animated titles. New Line
Cinema is one of the top studios as well.</p></li><li><p>Music: Warner Music Group accounted for about 1/4
of 1998's top-selling albums.</p></li></ul></div><p>Meanwhile, AOL sells the Internet on training wheels to
nearly 55% of the people who log on from the U.S. alone, and they
make money doing it&mdash;more than $5 billion US a year. That's on top
of Time Warner's $26+ billion US.
</p><p>Against that, we've got what? A bunch of hackers? Well,
yeah&mdash;and that's why we'll win.</p><p>AOL didn't invent the Net. Hackers did. They didn't invent it
as yet another way to pump out <span   class="emphasis"><em>content</em></span> and
suck back credit card purchases. They invented it so no one could
own it, anyone could use it, and nothing could threaten it.</p><p>&ldquo;All the significant trends start with technologists,&rdquo; Marc
Andreessen told us back in 1998, when we interviewed him about the
open sourcing of Netscape's Mozilla code (&ldquo;Betting on Darwin&rdquo;,
<i  >Linux Journal</i>, August 1998). In the same
interview, he added, &ldquo;Technologists are driving progress, and it's
easier to drive with Linux than with anything else.&rdquo;</p><p>So let's savor this irony: while Netscape now belongs to AOL,
and Mozilla (still funded by what's left of Netscape) lags behind
Microsoft's Internet Explorer in the consumer market, Intel is
quietly building its new home Internet appliances&mdash;TV set-top boxes
and thin network clients&mdash;with Mozilla code running on Linux. If
these catch on, they'll bypass AOL and every other mass-market
megalith that continues to regard the Net as yet another one-way
shipping system between a few suppliers and a zillion consumers.
These appliances will prove yet again that the connections which
matter most are the ones between human beings, and that includes
the human beings who do e-business with each other.</p><p>From the day the first packet moved across a TCP/IP network,
economic power has been shifting steadily from supply to demand.
Wars and marriages between giant suppliers still make great
stories, but those stories have little or nothing to do with what's
really going on. Hackers&mdash;the programmers, inventors, developers
and architects who are building this new world&mdash;have been trying to
make sure the stuff that matters most is what works for everyone
because it belongs to no one. They do it by turning markets into
what they were thousands of years before industry turned &ldquo;market&rdquo;
into a verb: places where people gather, talk about what matters to
them and do business together.</p><p>Demand will win because it is equipped to win.
Mouse-to-mouse, link-to-link, page-to-page, e-mail-to-e-mail,
voice-to-voice, customers are going to come out on top, along with
the companies who make it easy to do business with them. Those
companies will know that the best way to relate to customers is as
human beings, not as abstract populations to attack, control,
capture and herd like dumb beasts.</p><p>The real war is between markets and marketing. For decades,
marketing has been the military wing of business, working
&ldquo;strategically&rdquo; to &ldquo;attack&rdquo;, &ldquo;capture&rdquo; and &ldquo;deliver impact&rdquo;
to populations it calls &ldquo;eyeballs&rdquo;, &ldquo;seats&rdquo;, &ldquo;end users&rdquo;,
&ldquo;demographics&rdquo; and &ldquo;consumers&rdquo;. (Jerry Michalski calls them
&ldquo;gullets that live only to gulp products and crap cash.&rdquo;) The
problem with marketing is that there is no demand&mdash;no market&mdash;for
its insults. That's why markets will win.</p><p>Is the AOL/Time Warner deal a bet on markets or on marketing?
Credit where due: AOL has done a terrific job of equipping demand
to deliver clues (as well as money) to supply. But the consumers
AOL wants to &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; and &ldquo;deliver content&rdquo; to will only
become better equipped to screen out unwanted content, and more
significantly, to converse with its sources.</p><p>What happens when the mute buttons on remote controls send
&ldquo;we hate this&rdquo; messages directly back to the advertisers who pay
for the media? What happens when consumers turn into real customers
with real names who express no desire for
<span   class="emphasis"><em>messages</em></span> mostly intended for someone else? The
business model for mass media advertising falls like a bad tent,
that's what.</p><p>There's an old advertising adage that says, &ldquo;I know half my
money is wasted. I just don't know which half.&rdquo; In the advertising
tradition, even that's a lie. Direct mail, one of the most
efficient forms of advertising, counts a 3% response rate as a
success. The dirty truth about most advertising is that it has
always been woefully inefficient, especially in mass markets.
However, much of it has been successful, which is why it's still
around.</p><p>That success, of course, came in the absence of alternatives.
Worse, it came in the absence of demand from consumers. But
consumers were never advertising's real market; they paid nothing
for advertising's goods, and exerted no direct influence over it.
As a result, countless marketers and &ldquo;creatives&rdquo; in advertising
agencies (including the hip new &ldquo;interactive&rdquo; agencies) still
labor over screens and keyboards to come up with
<span   class="emphasis"><em>messages</em></span> to deliver to people who have little
or no interest in it.</p><p>The notable exceptions, of course, are classifieds, yellow
pages and trade publications like <i  >Linux Journal</i>, which are sources of both useful editorial
content and relevant information paid for by companies of interest
to readers.</p><p>So here's a clue for mass marketers who think AOL's customers
are going to sit still for the kind of heavy abuse that television
has been delivering to its addicts for decades: there is no demand
for messages. There never was. When that clue finally arrives, it
will be like a fist through the screen.</p><p>Provided, of course, that the hackers keep doing their good
work.</p><p>The fight is far from over. The good guys will win the OS war
and maybe even the browser war, but there are other enabling
technologies that still belong to suppliers with controlling
intentions. Streaming media is one. Instant messaging is another.
Both could be far more useful than the bait-for-advertising
vehicles we see today. Look at the differences between AOL's
Instant Messenger and what's starting to come from the Jabber
people. Better yet, join the movement. Let's start to show these
guys what's really valuable.</p></div></div>
