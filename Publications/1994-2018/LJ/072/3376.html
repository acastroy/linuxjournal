    Every web site needs a way to get accurate statitics&mdash;here's
    a freely available program to give you that information.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2a7f450"></a></h2></div></div><p>One of the many responsibilities of being
a webmaster is keeping tabs on the traffic your site receives. This
information can help when it comes time to update: you will know
which pages are requested most often and which could use a little
more promotion.
</p><p>Analog is an open-source program that analyses log files from
web servers, creating as many as 32 different reports. It works on
many operating systems, including Linux, and supports 35 different
languages. It's extremely flexible and fast. Its author is Stephen
Turner, a Research fellow at Sidney Sussex College at the
University of Cambridge. His research has to do with mathematical
problems in communications networks, so he has a good solid
background when it comes to log file analysis.</p><p>Analog's versatility can make it seem very complicated; it
has over 200 configuration options. The number of choices is also
what makes it very useful for hostmasters and webmasters
alike.</p><p>A common question on the analog-help mail list is, &ldquo;How do I
setup Analog for virtual hosts?&rdquo;. This article will cover setup
for both virtual hosts and individual pages. In addition, I'll
describe how to use configuration and script files to get monthly,
hourly, daily and specialized reports.</p><p>I've used Analog for several years, first on a FreeBSD
system; I was a dial-in customer curious about my personal web
pages. Later, I used Analog with Win95/98, and now use it on a
Linux system as a web administrator. An example of my publicly
available log analysis setup can be found at
<a href="http://vcsweb.com/logs" target="_self">http://vcsweb.com/logs/</a>.</p><p>Analog is the type of program that no two users will use in
the same way, due to the vast number of options, only the items I
have experience with will be discussed.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2a7f768"></a>Myths About Analysing Log Files</h2></div></div><p>Before delving into Analog's configuration files, it's
important to understand what you can and can't learn about your
site from log files. First, the log files should be considered only
as an estimation of traffic. Log references aren't available when
web pages have been accessed from either browser or ISP cache
files. According to Analog's author, it's impossible to tell the
number of distinct visitors or the total number of visits.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The bottom line is that HTTP is a stateless
protocol. People don't log in and retrieve several documents: they
make a separate connection for each file they want. Many times,
they don't even behave as if they were logged in to one site.
Hence, Analog's emphasis on requests, rather than visits.</p></blockquote></div><p>What we can learn varies, depending on what the web server
writes to the logs. In general, this usually includes the computer
name (or IP number) requesting information, whether the request was
for a page (generally an HTML document) or another type of file,
the status of the request, the time and date the request was made,
and the number of bytes transferred. If the log file reports it, we
can also learn which web site or page referred the visitor to our
site and the browser they were using.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2a7f978"></a>Installation</h2></div></div><p>Analog's home page is at http://www.analog.cx/, and it can be
downloaded from
<a href="http://www.analog.cx/analog4.01.tar.gz" target="_self">www.analog.cx/analog4.01.tar.gz</a>.
This web site also lists several mirror sites for the file.</p><p>Installation is rather painless: simply type
<b  >make</b> while in the analog4.01 directory. Several
options can be set in the analhead.h file prior to using the
<span   class="bold"><b>make</b></span> command, such as host or
organization name, the log file path and name; I've found it more
practical to use the configuration files for these items instead.
The only item I needed to change in analhead.h was the directory
path of /usr/local/etc/httpd to /etc/httpd so it matched my Red Hat
Linux system, which allows me to use it from the /etc/httpd/analog
directory.</p><p>It should be noted that Analog will work from any directory,
as long as it can find its /lang directory. This can be
accomplished by adding the language file and path name to Analog's
configuration file(s), but for my use, it's easier to compile the
program to the directory in which I want to work. When using the
program as a single user, you can compile and use it from your home
directory.</p><p>As a second step to installing Analog, I highly recommend
viewing and bookmarking the local set of Analog's documentation in
your favorite web browser. If you use Analog for creating
HTML-format reports, this lets you have the documentation open in
one browser window while viewing the reports you've generated in
another. Analog isn't the type of program for which you can read
the documentation from start to finish, create one configuration
file and quit. Rather, the documentation provides information on
each of its over 200 commands; you experiment to find the settings
that suit your preferences.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2a7fc90"></a>Log Files</h2></div></div><p>Analog can be configured to use customized log formats, which
is a very good thing if you happen to have log files in various
formats created by different servers. Even though I've used a
number of different servers, I've been able to continue using
Analog to analyze new and old log files (of different formats) by
listing the type of log format before giving the name and path of
the log file. I now use the Apache web server's combined log
format, which produces a common log file that lists the referrer
and browser information with the log entry for each access.
Otherwise, I'd have separate log files, one for the referrer and
another for the browser, and would need to include these log files
when working with Analog's configuration files.</p><p>If you're a hostmaster, you can configure Apache to use a
different log file for each virtual host. This keeps the
information for each host separate and makes using Analog to
analyze your virtual host log files much more straightforward. This
is done using Apache's virtual host directive:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
&lt;VirtualHost vhost1.com&gt;
ServerAdmin webmaster@vhost1.com
DocumentRoot /www/docs/vhhost1.com
ServerName vhost1.com
ErrorLog logs/vhost1.com-error_log
CustomLog logs/vhost1.com-access_log combined
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2a7fe48"></a>Configuration Files</h2></div></div><p>While you can use Analog with just the analog.cfg file to
tell it what to do and where to save its report, if you want to
create different reports for virtual hosts and individual pages,
it's best to use multiple configuration files. Each configuration
file serves a different purpose and can be combined with script
files containing command-line switches for Analog.</p><p>In this scenario, Analog is run not once, but several times;
each run creates a separate report. The analog.cfg file includes
only a very few base commands that relate to our main site, not the
virtual host sites. When creating reports for virtual hosts, I
exclude analog.cfg from being called with the <b  >-G</b>
command-line switch.</p><p>The basic arrangement is similar to a pyramid format. All
major items are in a master.cfg file to cover the broad category of
all virtual hosts on our system. Items relating only to a specific
virtual host and their general preferences are in the next tier,
and finally, individual page.cfg files are in the last category.
This allows me to create specialized setups as needed and still
track individual hosts, sites and pages without making major
changes.</p><p>When Analog is run for a virtual host, the master.cfg file is
called first, followed by the master-vhost.cfg (I replace &ldquo;vhost&rdquo;
with the name of the host when naming the file), and finally,
single-page configuration files for separate pages. An example
master.cfg file is included here (see Listing 1).</p><p><a href="3376l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2a80160"></a>Virtual Host Master Configuration Files</h2></div></div><p><a href="3376l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>An example vhost.cfg file is shown in Listing 2, and as you
can see, it's fairly general, since most of the report formatting
and such is handled by the master.cfg file. The vhost.cfg file can
be used to create a &ldquo;total activity&rdquo; report for the virtual host.
The command-line prompt (or script file), shown without paths for
clarity, is:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
analog -G +gmaster.cfg +gvhost1.cfg
  +Ovhost1-total.html
</pre><p>The <b  >-G</b> tells Analog not to use analog.cfg
(which is used for the main host only). <b  >+g</b> is
used whenever we use additional configuration files: there's no
space between it and the file name. <b  >+O</b>
designates the output file name: it's the letter O, not the number
zero.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2a804d0"></a>Individual Page or Site Configuration
Files</h2></div></div><p>Single configuration files are used to give the basic
information on the files(s) to include in the report (using the
FILEINCLUDE command). The <b  >HOSTNAME</b> and
<b  >HOSTURL</b> directives are the items that will
appear at the top of each report after the words &ldquo;Web Server
Statistics for&rdquo;. For individual pages, we use the name and URL of
the page rather than the host name or URL. A single-page
configuration file can be three or more lines, as shown in Listing
3.</p><p><a href="3376l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>Notice that the log file to use, output file and
report-formatting commands aren't included; these items are set
either in the master.cfg files or within the script file when
Analog is run. This lets me use the same information when creating
the daily and monthly reports, even though the two reports are very
different.</p><p>The <b  >FILEINCLUDE</b> command causes Analog to
search through the logs and retrieve data relating to only the file
you've specified. It's a very powerful command, and is normally
used in the configuration files for individual pages or sites. It
can also be used with a wild card; if I wanted to include all files
in the widgets directory, I would use:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
FILEINCLUDE http://vhost1.com/widgets/*
</pre><p>The command line used to create a daily report for this page
(all on one line), shown without path information for clarity, is:
<pre     class="programlisting">
analog -G +gmaster.cfg +gmaster-vhost1.cfg
+gwidgets.cfg +Owidget.html
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2a80948"></a>Monthly Text Report Configuration Files</h2></div></div><p>I mail a monthly report of web stats to a few of my customers
who aren't on-line and who have found the daily reports were too
long to print and took too much time to edit. To solve the problem
and save time, I created month-vhost.cfg files which create ASCII
text format reports. The month-vhost.cfg files are used in
conjunction with the individual configuration files described
above. A sample month-vhost.cfg file is shown in Listing 4. To
produce the monthly text reports, <b  >+a</b> is used on
the command line to designate ASCII output:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
analog -G +gmonth-vhost1.cfg +gwidgets.cfg\
+Owidget.txt +a
</pre><p><a href="3376l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a>
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2a80bb0"></a>Server Activity Configuration File</h2></div></div><p>As I'm responsible for the entire system, it's important to
have a review of the overall picture, including all our hosts. To
accomplish this, I have a separate activity configuration file and
run Analog once a day with a <span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>
entry. The activity configuration file includes the log files for
all hosts, and this requires giving extra information to Analog so
it can format the results; otherwise, /index.html would be
considered as belonging to one host. Commands in configuration
files must be on one line. The LOGFILE command allows you to
specify the name of the host corresponding to the log file (ignore
line wrap):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
LOGFILE /var/log/httpd/access_log
 http://main-isp.com/LOGFILE /var/log/httpd/vhost1.com-access_log
 http://vhost1.com
</pre></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2e78fb8"></a>Keeping Information Private</h2></div></div><p>Our daily reports are published on the Web, so I prefer to
keep cgi-bin information confidential. A daily webmaster e-mail
report (described below) takes care of informing me of web-related
exploits, so the information isn't required on the public reports.
The cgi-bin directories and file names need to be aliased so that
this information isn't available to the public. Analog can use
output aliases to give control over how a file or directory is
displayed within reports. This can be used to keep complete path
and file names from the public, if desired. I use the following
alias commands in my master.cfg files to translate cgi-bin path and
file information to simply admin (ignore line wrap):</p><pre     class="programlisting">
REQOUTPUTALIAS */cgi-bin/* "admin"
DIROUTPUTALIAS */cgi-bin/* "admin"
FAILOUTPUTALIAS */cgi-bin/* "admin"
FAILREFOUTPUTALIAS */cgi-bin/* "admin"
TYPEOUTPUTALIAS */cgi-bin/* "admin"
REFOUTPUTALIAS http://main-isp.com/cgi-bin/*  "admin"
REDIROUTPUTALIAS */cgi-bin/* "admin"
</pre><p>The last two items are used in Virtual Host master.cfg files,
so we're still not giving away information on other local hosts in
referral reports. If you want to be more specific, you could alias
file names to match what they do, such as the following line
(ignore wrap):
<pre     class="programlisting">
REQOUTPUTALIAS */cgi-bin/bannerpro.pl* "Banner Program"
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2e791c8"></a>Excluding Pages and Requests</h2></div></div><p>I have a number of partial pages such as footers, sidebars
and headers in a global directory that could cause Analog to
inflate the request totals out of proportion. When you exclude
information, it usually relates to the entire host, so it makes
sense to use <span   class="bold"><b>exclude</b></span> commands in
the master.cfg instead of in individual page or site configuration
files. To exclude global directory accesses from being counted as
requests, I use the command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
REQEXCLUDE */global/*
</pre><p>Partial web pages, such as header-and footer-type files, can
also be excluded individually with the
<b  >PAGEEXCLUDE</b> command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
PAGEEXCLUDE */footer.html
</pre>


or (for those who use PHP):
<pre     class="programlisting">
PAGEEXCLUDE */footer.php3
</pre>


</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2e794e0"></a>Daily Webmaster E-mail</h2></div></div><p>I use a small script to receive a daily Webmaster report.
This is basically the same as the Activity report, but it includes
information that's excluded from the public version. When I read my
e-mail in the morning, I can see the status of my system over the
last 24 hours. The script runs from cron, and since Analog will
send results to STDOUT if no outfile is listed, I use this to my
advantage. The output becomes the body of the e-mail. A bare-basics
webmaster.cfg file is included in Listing 5.</p><p><a href="3376l5.html" target="_self">Listing 5</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2e79698"></a>Automating with Scripts and cron</h2></div></div><p>Using script files allows Analog to create several reports,
one after the other. After the configuration files, the script
files are the next step. I use one hourly script to create the
Activity Report, and two daily script files: one for daily reports
that are published on the Web, and the other to send the webmaster
e-mail each morning. A monthly script file creates the text files
that are mailed to customers each month. These scripts are shown in
Listings 6-9.</p><p><a href="3376l6.html" target="_self">Listing 6</a></p><p><a href="3376l7.html" target="_self">Listing 7</a></p><p><a href="3376l8.html" target="_self">Listing 8</a></p><p><a href="3376l9.html" target="_self">Listing 9</a></p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2987580.0x2e79a60"></a>Web Index for Published Reports</h2></div></div><p>When working with the web-published statistics reports, or
when simply checking them periodically, it's much easier if you
create an index web page for reports and bookmark it. While this
may seem a common-sense thing to do, I remember my early days of
experimenting with Analog and fumbling around directories to find
the resulting reports. Every step toward making analyzing our logs
easier means we have a little extra time to work on developing
other web projects to add to the list and continue the
cycle.</p></div></div>
