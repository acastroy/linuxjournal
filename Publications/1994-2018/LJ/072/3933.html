across glorious ground</h2></div></div><p>Welcome to another episode of typical brilliance. Yes, it's
time for another round of Stupid Programming Tricks. We've been
doing tricks for a while, and we can make some neat stuff, but are
we as cool as the guys who wrote arcades such as Ms. PacMan,
Arkanoid and Joust? Those were pretty fun video games, even if they
were 2-D and took place on stationary backgrounds. The point is,
software can be truly fun even if it's simple, and the most elegant
game would likely be the simplest. (I imagine you can find Go
enthusiasts who would agree.) Now, imagine if thousands of people
across the world were playing a video game you wrote&mdash;that'd be
pretty amazing.</p><p>The C language, libraries and GNU/Linux tools make it
possible to develop software quickly, and game programming is one
of the very best ways to learn how to code. It involves challenges
of interface design, graphics and animation, real-time scheduling,
collision detection, physics, sound, hardware interfaces (such as
keyboard, joystick and mouse), as well as limitless creative scope.
Best of all, game programming techniques are applicable to
<span   class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> kind of programming, from audio and video
applications to user interfaces and indeed any program from &ldquo;Hello
World!&rdquo; on up.</p><p>Programing an entire game is a mildly difficult project that
could take a few days, but we'll look at one of the most basic
elements, something applicable to any application involving
graphics. We've already discussed how to initiate console graphics,
how to scroll text across a screen and how to play music and sound.
Now, we'll take a look at something simple but important: how to
move an object smoothly over a background without damaging the
background.</p><p>For our purposes, we'll start with the usual SVGAlib (you
know, runs-as-root-not-very-safe SVGAlib), and initialize two
screens: our virtual screen and our physical screen. The standard
procedure, as you may remember from previous episodes, is to do all
our drawing to the virtual screen (because it's
<span   class="emphasis"><em>much</em></span> faster and flicker-free), then copy the
virtual screen to the physical screen and hold it still for 1/60th
of a second (the duration of a vertical refresh, which could even
be 1/85th of a second on really fast equipment). For our
background, we'll generate something cool by drawing a few lines
and applying some sine equations to the pallette. As for the shape
we intend to slide over the background, we'll use some equations to
make a very funky square. Obviously, it's a small step to go from
this situation to loading a custom-drawn background and an animated
character, but we'll stick with our simple approach, largely
because algorithms that generate graphics are inherently
cool.</p><p>If you draw a background and then move your graphic across
the screen, you'll leave a trail of pixels and ruin the background,
which often happens periodically on slow computers running X. (You
may remember the grey smears caused by moving a window, especially
in Netscape and advanced window managers.) One solution is to
redraw the entire background, then stamp your graphic in its new
location. The problem with this approach is it severely wastes
processor resources (you'll be redrawing the background at least 60
times every second), which makes for slow programs. Personally, I
favor fast code and hack-job optimizations over structurally
organized, procedural code; for example, loops instead of recursive
algorithms. Redrawing the background often makes sense, if you're
making changes to the entire background or if you do not have
hardware scrolling capabilities. Suppose you have a 320x200x256
background (320 pixels wide, 200 pixels tall, with 256 8-bit
colors), and you want to move only a 16x16 graphic across it. Think
Ms. PacMan. Why not just draw the heroine and the ghosts? Why
redraw the maze all the time, if it doesn't change? How much is
actually moving?</p><p>The procedure we'll use is known as the cookie-cutter
technique. It involves making a backup copy of the area onto which
you want to stamp your graphic (on an Amiga, we'd call it
&ldquo;blitting&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;stamping&rdquo;). Essentially, you make a
backup copy of the target area, stamp your graphic over that area
on the screen, hold it for a vertical refresh (so that the image is
present long enough for the eye to register it), then replace the
stamped area with the backup (cookie-cut) you made, stamping the
background over your old image, and start again. As long as your
graphic uses transparent or masked bits (instead of stamping solid
black), you'll see your graphic sitting nicely on top of the
background. It's the same situation as laying a graphic on the
background of a web page, only here it's moving.</p><p>In our actual program, you'll notice we're using a physical
screen and a virtual screen, when we could get by if we used only a
physical screen (after all, copying a virtual screen to a physical
screen is a more processor-intensive procedure than copying 16x16
pixels of background to a backup buffer, blitting a 16x16 image,
and replacing the 16x16 background segment). The point is that
drawing to a virtual screen is very fast, and if you ever want to
do more than a single moving box, you'll be very happy you're
already using the virtual screen. Extensibility is a good idea,
especially when you leave things open for your own
imagination.</p><p>The routine for moving the box will be simple. We'll use a
sine for the x coordinate and a sine for the y coordinate (it'll
look very smooth). We need to avoid accidentally drawing parts of
the graphic out of bounds (which can lead to a segmentation fault),
so the equations won't look exactly like 160*sin(x)+160 or
100*sin(x)+100, but they'll be fairly close. Sine equations are
very useful, and chips these days are very fast at trig so you
don't have to worry about optimizing, for example, by building a
table of already-calculated sine values. For fun, we could also
cycle the colors so that the image would look groovy, but you can
try to implement this yourself, if your computer is fast enough.
Here we go, and remember, this time we'll need the math library, so
compile with</p><pre     class="programlisting">
gcc -Wall -O2 joyousbox.c -lvgagl -lvga -lm -o\
  joyousbox
</pre><p>(recent gcc/egcs versions will automatically link the math
library, but to be sure, we like to include it). See Listing.

<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3933bf1.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Using Linux and Informix to register for conferences is a
reality; it happened at ALS (Atlanta Linux Showcase) last year. I
talked to Tim Costello, the man who made it happen, by e-mail on
January 31. Tim is a Senior Systems Analyst for Conference
Management Systems, LLC. This company specializes in convention
services, e.g., registration, travel and hotel booking, message
centers, booth locators, temporary staffing and related
services.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Tell me a bit about
yourself.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: I have worked with CMS
since April 1994. I have been in the computer industry since about
1984&mdash;before that, it was just a hobby&mdash;when I started doing some
Dbase programming and general consulting for a local
company.</p><p>When I first started college in 1986, I planned on an EE
degree with a CS minor. In 1992, I graduated with a degree in
Technical Theatre (Lighting and Sound Design) with a CS minor.
After college, I worked as a consultant Monday through Thursday and
did lighting for local events most Fridays through Sundays. Then in
late 1993, I got a call from a friend who was touring with Disney's
&ldquo;Beauty and the Beast on Ice&rdquo; in Europe. They needed an
electrician ASAP, so for the next six months I toured Europe with
Disney. At the end of the tour, I received a job offer from CMS, a
consulting client of mine. So the day after I flew back from
Barcelona, I was at work at CMS buying equipment for one of our
early shows.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How long have you
been involved in the Linux community?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: I first started using
Linux early in my tenure at CMS, so I would guess late 1994. I
haven't contributed any programming to the community, but I answer
questions in the newsgroups whenever I can and submit as many bug
reports as possible.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How did you come to
be taking care of ALS registration? Do you belong to ALE?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: We submitted a proposal
for registration services in response to a request from ALS. One
stipulation in the Request For Proposal from ALS was the use of
open-source software, which we were already using&mdash;we were a
perfect fit. No, I am not part of ALE; CMS is based in Park Ridge,
IL.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Have you done
registration of shows before?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Convention registration
is a core business for us. We do registration for several hundred
shows a year, ranging from small corporate meetings to ones with
over 20,000 attendees.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: How did you come to
pick Informix as your database of choice? How did the combination
of Linux/Informix work for you? Have you used other systems to take
care of registrations? How did Linux compare?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: I'll answer all these
questions in a group. When we first started doing registration, we
used HP9000s/HP-UX and Informix&mdash;all purchased prior to my coming
on board. During this time, I was using a Linux box as my office
desktop and was the system administrator for both systems. As time
went by, whenever we needed a new server, I would use a Linux box;
e.g., our dial-in/fax server is a Linux box using
<span   class="bold"><b>mgetty-sendfax</b></span>. Until Informix
came around and ported to Linux, I was stuck with the HP9Ks. I was
involved in the lobbying effort (I signed the e-petitions) to get
Informix to port to Linux, and as soon as it was available as a
public beta, I started testing with it. I find the Linux boxes
easier to administer than the HPs, and on a price/performance
curve, I find them much more attractive.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Would you have
preferred to use some other system?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: No. We began a move to
SCO UNIX as a stop-gap when Informix was still publicly undecided
about a port. Those systems were wiped and moved to Linux as soon
as possible.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What do you feel are
the main advantages to using Linux/Informix over other
systems?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Ease of system
administration and availability of assistance.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Drawbacks?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: Commercial software
availability, or the lack thereof. One of the other services we
offer for conventions is a voice-messaging system, using Dialogic
voice cards. I am currently forced to use Windows and Visual Basic
to access them, and until a month or so ago, there seemed to be no
hope unless I switched vendors&mdash;something I may still do, but I
hate to waste my existing investment. However, when Intel recently
acquired Dialogic, they announced they would support Linux!</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Do you use
Linux/Informix in other business situations? If so, tell us about
them.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: We use Linux for all
our servers, web (with Apache), fax (with mgetty), file and print
(with Netatalk) and database (with Informix).</p><p>Other open-source systems in use at our location are Python,
PHP3 and Perl, among others. We use Red Hat and Linux-Mandrake on
our servers, with some updates/patches.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: What did you think
about the ALS event itself?</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Tim</b></span>: I enjoyed every minute
of it! Next year, we plan on additional people from our staff going
to the show, so we can trade off working at registration. There
were several sessions I would have liked to attend, but missed due
to my duties at registration.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>Margie</b></span>: Thanks for your
time. &mdash;Marjorie Richardson</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc4580.0x10bd948"></a>THE BUZZ</h2></div></div><p>Marc Torres leaving SuSE to head up Atipa.

was, as any Amiga freak would love the chance to tell you) came out
in 1985 with a 7.1MHz MC68k, 4096 colors, stereo sound, and was
enough to convert even Commodore 64 fanatics. Oddly enough,
Commodore acquired Amiga for $40 million back in July of '85, and
then destroyed its hopes of success by hapless marketing ploys.
Commodore itself died in 1995, and was sold to ESCOM for $12
million. Gateway ultimately acquired what remained of Amiga, and it
looked as though they were poised to bring back the once and future
queen. However, Gateway had bought Amiga for the patents, not for
its devotees, and the new vaporware Amigas never materialized. (You

community more or less collectively called for a boycott, ranging
from DVDs to the entire motion picture industry and even extending
to every single product, film-related or not, produced by any of
the big seven (Disney, Sony, MGM, Paramount, Fox, Universal Studios
and Warner Bros.). The 2600 community organized large protests
outside movie theaters across the country. This charming graphic
featured prominently in the thousands of flyers we
distributed.</p><p>

operating system, because it tends to inhabit boxes designed first
for other operating systems. This has been especially true for
clients. While special-purpose servers have been built around Linux
for years, clients have mostly been Window boxes with Linux
flowers, instead of the more familiar sort.</p><p>
<div       class="mediaobject"><img src="3933kf2.jpg"></div>
</p><p>Portables have been especially vexing to Linux hardware
manufacturers. All your familiar laptops are packed with arcane
drivers and embedded characteristics that make running Linux
somewhat of an iffy proposition.</p><p>Not any more. Now we are seeing a new generation of portables
designed from the ground up to run Linux. One of the first out of
the gate appears to be a remarkable new machine from Boxx,
<a href="http://www.boxx.net" target="_self">http://www.boxx.net/</a>.
Described as &ldquo;the first portable/slim desktop hybrid computer
designed from the ground up for Linux-compatible multi-platform
computing&rdquo;, it's a veritable arsenal for the road warrior.</p><p>Despite its extreme variety of physical features, its best
talent may be its dual-boot capabilities. The user can install and
run two x86-compatible operating systems, one off the primary hard
drive and the other off the swappable device bay, key-selecting
between the two&mdash;it's like having two computers in one.</p><p>Here are a few more features of Boxx computers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Convertible from notebook to slim desktop,
presentation easel and pen tablet configurations</p></li><li><p>Detachable wireless (IR) keyboard and wireless

touch-sensitive panel (laser-pointer pen stylus)</p></li><li><p>Swappable device bay allowing a second HDD, CDRW,
DVD ROM, CD-ROM, LS 120, FDD or battery</p></li><li><p>3-D stereo sound with built-in active diaphragm

PowerPC were listed, including NetBSD (often not recognized as a
flavor of Linux, and for good reason&mdash;it isn't one!), MkLinux (an
implementation that sits on top of the Mach kernel) and LinuxPPC (a
typical Linux distribution for PPC). Three species? Diversity is a
big evolutionary advantage, and Linux intends on stickin' around,
so maybe you can see what's coming up 5th Avenue.</p><p>Linux for PowerPC is available from a number of sources, the
latest of which is SuSE. The chameleon enthusiasts from Germany
have delivered a beta of 6.3, and once the kinks get ironed out, we
can look forward to lizards on our Apples. TurboLinux, even though
it does not have a cute mascot of any kind, is nevertheless able to
bring its Japanese, Chinese and English language distribution to
users of the Motorola. Getting back to fuzzy furry animals, Terra
Soft's Yellow Dog Linux is yet another offering for Apple PowerPCs
and IBM RS/6000s.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>PowerPC Linux resources:

Merge</h2></div></div><p>A year ago, the term &ldquo;Linux business&rdquo; was something of an
oxymoron. Business? With &ldquo;free software&rdquo;? Well, that was before
the Red Hat IPO, which was when the world changed. By the time 1999
was out, &ldquo;Linux business&rdquo; included VA Linux, Andover.net, Cobalt
and other relatively new publicly traded companies whose combined
market value totaled in the dozens of millions of dollars.</p><p>Suddenly the question was, &ldquo;Who are these guys going to buy
with all this new market cap?&rdquo; Red Hat started with Cygnus. VA
started with Andover (which had its own spectacular IPO at about
the same time as VA's). All eyes turned toward a pair of
well-established PC software companies that had recently
repositioned themselves as Linux businesses: Corel and
Inprise/Borland.</p><p>Both looked like they would help fill out the product
portfolios of either Red Hat or VA Linux. Neither Corel nor Inprise
would be easy to buy: both were profitable, with revenues in the
hundreds of millions despite relatively depressed market stock
values. But it looked do-able.</p><p>Then, on February 7, the two companies did something no one
expected: they merged with each other. The new company looked to
boast total sales of over $400 million, profits of a quarter that
sum, and a market cap at merger of $2.44 billion. It would be
called Corel, finally retiring Inprise/Borland's identity crisis
(though key Inprise products would still bear the Borland
brand).</p><p>Olive branches were immediately extended to the rest of the
Linux community. In an interview with <i  >Linux Journal</i>, Dale Fuller (the Inprise interim president and CEO who will become
chairman of Corel's board of directors) declared his intention to
partner with all the other Linux players, as well as its growing
legion of developers. &ldquo;We want to work with all the distributions
and with all the development communities,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They'll all
need applications and development tools. That's our business. We're
here to help.&rdquo;</p><p>The true test will come when Corel finishes coming out with
its complete office application suite, and Borland's Kylix project
completes the Delphi and C++ Builder development products for
Linux. With all those products ready, Linux will become truly
competitive (as well as compatible) with Microsoft on the desktop.
Will customers buy it? Stay tuned.</p><p>&mdash;Doc Searls</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xfc4580.0x164b9c8"></a>VENDOR NEWS</h2></div></div><p><span   class="bold"><b>DataViews Corporation</b></span>
