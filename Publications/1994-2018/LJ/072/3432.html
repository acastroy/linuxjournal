    A quick look at what you need to build a web site for your
    personal or business needs, with pointers to the details.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cdf580.0x1dd7558"></a></h2></div></div><p>When I needed to build a development and
demonstration system to start my own Internet-based business, I
decided to explore how to build an Internet site for education and
low-end business support. The technologies I chose allow an
individual to build a site he or she can control and use for
experimentation.
</p><p>If you own your own site, you have complete freedom to
explore technologies like Internet security, CGI (Common Gateway
Interface) and Java servlet development. Much of the work in this
area is handled behind the doors of an ISP (Internet Service
Provider); there are significant costs involved in CGI and other
server-side programming.</p><p>These technologies are difficult to deal with, since they may
introduce security flaws to an Internet site. Trying to stress the
security would certainly stress the system administrator. Features
like CGI and Java Servlets are programs that attach to the back
side of a web server. The owner of the web server would be
negligent if he simply allowed a customer to add programs without
serious testing.</p><p>When you are using an ISP, you are limited by the ISP to
specific technologies. Many ISPs will not permit CGI and Java
servlet programs to be used with even their basic ISP plans. More
advanced business plans often allow CGI or Java servlets, but will
restrict upgrades to your site by requiring that you pay them to
test your code before it goes live. This introduces delay, and
control limitations that may prohibit some features from being
deployed on your site.</p><p>To the small business, a personal Internet site offers
flexibility that is usually the domain of larger competitors. When
you own the site, you can make changes quickly and at relatively
low cost. You must also bear the responsibility for maintaining a
secure site and liability for the content of the site.</p><p>To keep the cost of our proposed &ldquo;Personal Internet Site&rdquo;
low, the majority of the software used will be freely available
operating system, programming tools and network software. The Free
Software Foundation and thousands of developers around the world
have contributed to a large base of freely available software. The
availability of free or nearly free software makes constructing the
system outlined in this article an achievable goal.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cdf580.0x1dd7818"></a>Scope of the Initial System</h2></div></div><p>The initial system will consist of several Intel-based
personal computers running Linux. For this project, I have selected
SuSE Linux 5.3. This is a recent distribution, with support for
most of the features needed for an Internet site. The system will
support a web server with a Java servlet runtime module. This
configuration supports dynamically created web pages using a JDBC
(Java Database Connectivity) compliant database.</p><p>Three PC class systems (AMD 5x86 133) and two K6-2 systems at
300+ MHz will constitute the processing core of this site. One
system will handle firewall, proxy and routing duties. (For details
on setting up these services, see &ldquo;My Linux Home Network&rdquo; by
Preston Crow in this issue.) These are the services that allow our
site to be visible to the Net and able to see the Net safely. The
other systems will support production services and development
support, respectively. Possibly an old 486 DX2 66 will be dusted
off for a very light Internet appliance task.</p><p>An appropriate modem supporting the physical and link-level
connectivity will be installed on the slowest system that can keep
up with the data stream while handling the task of firewall chores,
DNS and routing. By trimming the OS down to minimal-required
functionality, it can be small enough to allow an older machine to
be used for this dedicated connectivity task. The Linux Router
Project (LRP) has a minimal configuration defined to support
systems as small as a 386SX 16 with 8MB of RAM. (For details, see
&ldquo;The Linux Router Project&rdquo; by David Cinege,
<i  >LJ</i>, March 1999.) This is an input- and
output-intensive process, and it doesn't take much computer to keep
up with a 128KBps data stream.</p><p>The Linux OS with networking support for IP configuration
will be standard on all systems. In order to best optimize the OS,
I have reconfigured and compiled the Linux kernel using the
parameters required to provide networking features for an Internet
site. This includes all support for the hardware network interfaces
as well as IP networking and firewall options. All nonessential
capabilities, such as multimedia features, are removed.</p><p>Web support consisting of the Apache web server with Java
servlet extensions is already installed and running. Early
prototyping of production systems will include Java JDBC
server-side support. (See &ldquo;Using Java Servlets with Database
Connectivity&rdquo; by Bruce McDonald, <i  >LJ</i>, June
1999.) Database chores will initially be handled by PostgreSQL.
(See &ldquo;PostgreSQL&mdash;The Linux of Databases&rdquo; by Rolf Herzog,
<i  >LJ</i>, February 1998.)</p><p>Fast Ethernet is used between the existing systems at the
site. Systems not visible to the Internet will use IP (Internet
Protocol) masquerading to enhance their security. (See &ldquo;Setting Up
a Linux Gateway&rdquo; by Lawrence Teo in this issue.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cdf580.0x1dd7be0"></a>Required Services</h2></div></div><p>Connecting to the Net requires that we deal with issues
related to physical and logical connectivity. The physical
connectivity issues are based on the selection and provisioning of
telco (telephone company) or cable lines. The options for physical
connectivity with modest bandwidth appear to be ISDN (Integrated
Services Digital Network), DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) and cable
IP services.</p><p>The services I need to connect to the Internet fall into two
categories: telco services and IP access provider. I really don't
need ISP (Internet Service Provider) services, because I will be my
own ISP. All the services an ISP usually provides are available on
the system as I have it configured.</p><p>Of the technologies available, ISDN is the oldest, dating
back to 1978. DSL and cable modems are relatively new technologies
and availability is limited for all these technologies. (See &ldquo;The
(not so) Wonderful World of High-Speed Internet Access&rdquo; by Jason
Schumaker in this issue.) Since DSL and cable IP are not available
in my area, connectivity will be provided by an ISDN line. Internet
access is provided by US West and can be connected 24x7 (24 hours a
day, 7 days a week) with &ldquo;on demand&rdquo; service. In the interest of
keeping the initial cost of the site down, I have arranged to
obtain a used 3Com Impact IQ ISDN network adapter (they really
aren't modems) to attach my system to my selected IP access
provider.</p><p>On the logical side of connectivity, we need routing support
and an Internet address. In this case, the US West Network will
provide routing and DNS (Domain Name Services) support to my site.
To be addressable, I need an IP number for my site. Eight static IP
numbers are being rented from US West for $15.00 US per month. This
yields five usable IP addresses, with the remainder used for
configuration purposes. (See &ldquo;Simplified IP Addressing&rdquo; by Gene
E. Hector, <i  >LJ</i>, January 2000.)</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cdf580.0x1dd7e48"></a>Becoming Visible</h2></div></div><p>This configuration has been successfully tested from the Net.
I connected the system, noted its dynamic address, then logged in
to the system with HTTP, TELNET and FTP sessions from a remote
location. This assures me the system configuration is ready to
support the services I plan to use for this Internet site.</p><p>To be visible to users of the Internet, the site will need to
have a domain name that is registered with an organization called
Internic. The web page at
<a href="http://www.internic.net" target="_self">http://www.internic.net/</a>
has the information and forms to register a domain name. In order
to register for a domain, you must have a primary and a secondary
DNS with which you define your system. The people who are
responsible for those systems should be aware of your intentions,
or you may find your site falling off the Net.</p><p>A domain name is required to be visible as something other
than its assigned IP number. It would be difficult to remember
network addresses in the IP number format of ###.###.###.### (e.g.,
192.168.1.1), so a domain name puts our site in the form of
&ldquo;mySite.com&rdquo;. The Internet Access Provider will have to provide
DNS visibility to the rest of the Net for my five static IP
addresses and the domain name or names they represent.</p><p>Once I have a domain name, I can add aliases and extensions
to define additional systems and services. For web access, a simple
<a href="http://www.mySite.com" target="_self">http://www.mySite.com/</a>
produces a URL to access web pages. E-mail provided by an ISP is
usually rather limited, often to five or fewer mailboxes. When you
own the site and the mail router, you can have as many mailboxes as
you wish. An outside user can send mail to me@mySite.com, and my
own mail server will get it to my mailbox.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1cdf580.0x1dd8108"></a>Conclusion</h2></div></div><p>It is possible to start up an Internet site with typical ISP
services in your home office. The availability of industrial-grade
software for free is one of the key elements that makes this
possible. Low-cost computers would not be enough if you had to add
tens of thousands of dollars in license fees to the system. This
quickly becomes prohibitive without free software.</p><p>From an educational perspective, this is an excellent
platform for expanding skills. The OS and tools provide a
high-quality system, with source code to delve into as necessary.
Open standards are strongly supported and all major Internet
development languages are available.</p><p>A variety of skills are related to developing and managing an
Internet presence. This configuration can be used to study Internet
site security, including common tools like Satan or Tripwire. These
two tools help an administrator verify security and help detect
breaks in activity, respectively. Other uses of the site once it's
up include e-commerce and application server development. Using
technologies like JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and CORBA allow
the development of significant commercial projects.</p><p>Of course, if you should outgrow these systems, it is
possible to move up to RISC-based hardware with Linux, as it runs
on DEC Alpha, PowerPC, SPARC and MIPS processors as well as Intel.
The upgrade path to other hardware and other UNIX implementations
is much easier from Linux than from an Apple, a Windows NT Server
or proprietary network elements.</p></div></div>
