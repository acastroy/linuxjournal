    Mr. Collyer continues his discussion with a detailed
    description of the addpath function.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1955580.0x1a4d4a8"></a></h2></div></div><p>In my previous article, I described a
shell function that handled command-line options. In Part 2, we
will use it in the path variable functions I promised to describe.
</p><p>Each of the path variable shell functions is structured in a
similar fashion. First, local variables are declared. Next comes
the option-handling code, which employs the options function we
became familiar with last month. Finally, the main functionality of
the code is implemented. Because each function has the same
structure, I will describe only one in detail this month. The next
installment will describe various implementation features of the
remaining functions.</p><p>We must first understand what the &ldquo;environment&rdquo; of a
process is. The path variables we manipulate will usually be
variables in the environment of a process, and we need our
functions to alter their values (for example to add or remove
directories).</p><p>In a nutshell, the environment of a process is a group of
named variables (similar to shell variables) which are passed to
any created child process. (A process, of course, is the entity
which runs a program. If you type <b  >ls</b> to a shell,
for example, this creates a process to run the
<span   class="bold"><b>ls</b></span> program.) A shell variable can
be put into the environment by &ldquo;exporting&rdquo; it. For example, the
commands</p><pre     class="programlisting">
A=fred
export $A
</pre><p>create a shell variable called <b  >A</b> and turn
it into an environment variable. So, if you start a new process
from this shell, it can examine its environment, find the
<b  >A</b> variable and notice it has a value of
<b  >fred</b>. Environment variables, therefore, provide
a one-way channel of information&mdash;from parent process to child. The
parent and child processes don't share the environment
variables&mdash;the child is given a new copy of them. Thus, if a child
process changes the value of an environment variable, the parent
will not be aware of the change.
</p><p>Now, we <span   class="emphasis"><em>wish</em></span> to modify the path
environment variables so that we can't start a new process when we
run our shell utilities. Our utilities are implemented as
functions, because functions run in the context of the calling
process. Although they do not get a copy of the environment
variables, they do have access to the existing set.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x1955580.0x1a4d9d0"></a>The addpath Function</h2></div></div><p>The purpose of <span   class="bold"><b>addpath</b></span> is to
add a pathel (path element) to a pathvar (path variable) in an
idempotent fashion. Idempotent literally means &ldquo;of equal power&rdquo;
and figuratively means &ldquo;doing it <span   class="emphasis"><em>N</em></span> times is
the same as doing it once&rdquo;. So, for example,</p><pre     class="programlisting">
NEWP=
addpath -p NEWP /abc
addpath -p NEWP /abc
</pre><p>adds <b  >/abc</b> to the pathvar
<b  >NEWP</b> exactly once.
<span   class="bold"><b>addpath</b></span> checks the pathvar to see
if the pathel is already present. If not, it adds it; if so, it
doesn't.
</p><p>This function is helpful, because if you use it to add to
your <b  >PATH</b>, for example, you won't end up with
multiple copies of the same directory in your path. The code to do
this is shown split up into various listings to make discussion
easier.</p><p><a href="3768l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>In Listing 1, we create some variables local to the function.
The set in the first three lines is for options handling; the set
in the final 4 lines contains variables specific to this function.
The options handling variables tend to be very similar in each
function that uses the options function.</p><p><a href="3768l2.html" target="_self">Listing 2</a></p><p>In Listing 2, we handle the options supplied to the function.
We do this by calling the options functions described last month.
We tell it the names of the options we are prepared to handle, and
give it a quoted list of the supplied arguments. When options
returns, it will give us information on the supplied arguments in
the form of variables which it has created. In addpath, we are
prepared to handle <b  >-h, -f, -b</b> and
<b  >-p</b>, (<b  >-p</b> options. The -p
option requires an argument, which is the name of a pathvar, such
as <b  >PATH</b>. When options returns, it also creates a
variable called <b  >options_shift_val</b>. We can use
this to shift away those command-line arguments it has already
handled (i.e., arguments like <b  >-h, -b</b> and so on).
We do this immediately after the call to options. So, if the user
had specified <b  >-h</b> only, then
<b  >options_shift_val</b> would be set to 1, and we
would shift away one argument; if <b  >-b</b> and
<b  >-p</b> were specified, we would shift away three
arguments (<b  >-b</b>, <b  >-p</b> and its
required pathvar).</p><p>The next four &ldquo;if&rdquo; blocks appear in each pathvar function
because they perform the following common tests:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>If options created a variable called
<b  >opt_h</b>, then a <b  >-h</b> argument was
supplied and the user wanted some help. This we give by printing
out usage information for the function and calling
<span   class="bold"><b>return</b></span>. When a function call
returns, it terminates, like a function call return in C. Don't
make the mistake of calling <span   class="bold"><b>exit</b></span>
in a function --this will terminate the shell process calling the
function, which is probably not what you wanted to do.</p></li><li><p>We examine the <b  >options_missing_arg
variable</b>, which options creates if you didn't supply a
required argument for an option. If this occurs, we print out the
usage message, tell the user what went wrong and return.</p></li><li><p>We examine
<b  >options_unknown_option</b>.
<span   class="bold"><b>options</b></span> sets this when you supply
an argument that we're not prepared to handle (i.e., one that is
not <b  >-h</b>, <b  >-f</b>,
<b  >-b</b> or <b  >-p</b>, in this case). We
return after giving the user some help.</p></li><li><p>Finally, we look at
<b  >options_num_args_left</b>. This gives us a count of
the number of arguments that remain after we shifted away the ones
that have already processed. The code here will be specific to each
function, but for addpath, we require the user to specify the name
of the directory to append. We check for this (sloppily) by
complaining if no arguments are left at this point.</p></li></ol></div><p>So far, we have performed the type of options processing that
crops up over and over in shell scripts and functions that take
arguments. We have checked that we haven't been supplied any
options we don't know about, and that required arguments have been
given. We have also provided a basic help facility via the
<b  >-h</b> handling.
</p><p><a href="3768l3.html" target="_self">Listing 3</a></p><p>Listing 3 shows the option handling code specific to the
addpath function. The first two lines in this section set values
for the variables <b  >COMMAND</b> and
<b  >pathvar</b> to be used later. These lines may seem a
little cryptic at first sight, but essentially they set up the
default path variable to which we add (<b  >PATH</b>) and
the default command we execute to add to it. Note that there are
single quotes around the contents of <b  >COMMAND</b>.
The shell will store the literal string between the quotes into
<b  >COMMAND</b>, and no variable substitution will be
attempted.</p><p>If we type <b  >addpath /def</b>, then pathvar will
contain <b  >PATH</b>, <b  >sep</b> will
contain <b  >:</b> and <b  >dirname</b>, will
contain <b  >/def</b>. Later, when we evaluate a line of
code containing <b  >COMMAND</b>, the shell will
substitute the literal strings <b  >${pathvar}</b>,
<b  >${sep}</b> and <b  >${dirname}</b> with
their values to produce &ldquo;${PATH}:/def&rdquo;. Note that we used three
individual characters inside <b  >COMMAND</b>:
<b  >$</b>, <b  >{</b> and
<b  >}</b>. this ensures the shell interprets them
literally and that they appear in the evaluated output.</p><p>The next two lines of code override the defaults if either
the <b  >-f</b> or <b  >-p</b> option is given.
If <b  >-f</b> was given, the user wishes to add to the
front of the pathvar and we set <b  >COMMAND</b>
accordingly, putting the pathvar variable at the end. If
<b  >-p</b> was given, the user supplied the name of a
path variable; the options function stores this in
<b  >opt_p</b> and we set the <b  >pathvar</b>
variable to this value. So, if the user typed:</p><p><b  >addpath -f -p NEWP /def</b></p><p>then <b  >opt_p</b> and thus
<b  >pathvar</b> will contain <b  >NEWP</b>,
and <b  >COMMAND</b> will look like
<b  >$dirname$sep\$$pathvar</b>, with the
<b  >dirname</b> variable sitting at the front.</p><p>Next, we set the value of the <b  >sep</b>
variable. Usually we want this to contain <b  >:</b>, as
that character separates path elements. However, if the path
variable to which we are adding is initially empty, we don't want
anything in <b  >sep</b>. This ensures we don't add
leading or trailing <b  >:</b> characters to the path.
The three lines of code starting <b  >sep=:</b> implement
this.</p><p>Finally, we store the name of the path element to be added in
<b  >dirname</b>. Note that at this point, it will be in
<b  >$1</b>; any other command-line arguments were
shifted away immediately after options returned.</p><p><a href="3768l4.html" target="_self">Listing 4</a></p><p>In Listing 4, we actually add the path element to the path
variable. The first thing to note is that the real work of the
function takes five lines of code. We have already performed all
the required setup and argument checking, so there is little left
to do. Essentially, we check to see whether the path element is
already present in <b  >pathvar</b>; if not, we add
it.</p><pre     class="programlisting">
element=$(eval echo \$$pathvar | colon2line |
  grep -x "$dirname")
</pre><p>First, note the <b  >variable=$(...)</b> syntax.
This is equivalent to the older <b  >variable="..."</b>
syntax and means &ldquo;Run the commands within the brackets, and use
what they write to standard output as the value of variable.&rdquo; This
is called command substitution. In our example, we have a pipeline
of commands; the output of the final command
(<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span>) becomes the value of
element. Let's look at each command in the pipeline. Remember that
<b  >$pathvar</b> contains the name of the path variable
we wish to add to, and <b  >$dirname</b> contains the
name of the directory to add.
</p><p>Assuming the value of <b  >$pathvar</b> is
<b  >PATH</b>, the command line is
<b  >eval&nbsp;echo pathvar&nbsp;</b> first expanded by
the shell to <b  >eval&nbsp;echo&nbsp;$PATH</b>. Next,
because of the <b  >eval</b>, the shell reevaluates the
line. This time it, expands <b  >$PATH</b> into something
like &ldquo;/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11&rdquo; and echoes its contents into
the next command in the pipeline.</p><p><span   class="bold"><b>colon2line</b></span> is another shell
function, with code we have not yet seen. It merely prints each
element of a colon-separated string on a separate line (i.e., it
converts the <b  >:</b> character to a newline
character). This can be done in many ways. Here, for example, is an
<span   class="bold"><b>awk</b></span> one-liner for this
purpose:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
awk `BEGIN{RS=":"}{print}'
</pre><p>This command tells awk to assume that <b  >:</b>
separates records in a piece of text, and then to print each
colon-separated record it sees. Each separate line is then read by
the third command in the pipeline.
</p><p>The command <b  >grep&nbsp;-x  "$dirname"</b>
is used to check for the presence of the path element we wish to
add. The shell will replace <b  >$dirname</b> with its
value before grep is executed. It is surrounded by quotes so we can
correctly handle the pathological case of
<b  >$dirname</b> containing spaces.</p><p>We tell grep we want only exact matches
(<b  >-x</b>). This ensures that if we run the following
commands:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
addpath /abc
addpath /ab
</pre><p>we add both of the distinct path elements. Without -x, grep
would report it had seen a match when the second command was run,
because &ldquo;/ab&rdquo; is a substring of &ldquo;/abc&rdquo;.
</p><p>If grep sees <b  >$dirname</b> in its input, it
writes the name to the standard output. Because we are using grep
in command substitution brackets, its output is assigned as the
value of the element variable.</p><p>In a nutshell, the pipeline ensures the element has a
non-null value if it is already present in the path variable, and a
null value otherwise. If the element is null (<b  >[ "$element"
= "" ]</b>), we add it with the following command:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
eval eval $pathvar=$COMMAND
</pre><p>By now, you should be familiar with the purpose of the eval
command: it tells the shell to reevaluate the line being processed,
and on each evaluation, shell variables are expanded. The only
question here is, why do we need two of them? Assume the user types
the following:
<pre     class="programlisting">
addpath /abc
</pre>


Assume further that PATH contained /usr/bin only, and that /abc was
not already present in $PATH. Let us look at how this line is
expanded step by step.
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>$pathvar=$COMMAND: initially</p></li><li><p>PATH=\$\{${pathvar}\}${sep}${dirname}: after first
shell expansion</p></li><li><p>PATH=${PATH}:/abc: after first eval</p></li><li><p>PATH=/usr/bin:/abc: after second eval</p></li></ol></div>

It should be clear that if we had applied only one eval to the
command, the shell would have executed the command in step 3 and we
would have replaced the current contents of <b  >PATH</b>
with the literal characters &ldquo;${PATH}:/abc&rdquo;. The final
<b  >eval</b> forces the replacement of the embedded
&ldquo;${PATH}&rdquo; string with its current value. Remember also that the
<b  >PATH</b> variable we alter here is not local to this
function; any changes made are visible to the calling shell.
</p><p>That ends the description of the addpath function. The
structure of the other pathvar functions is very similar to that of
addpath, so in Part 3, I will describe only one or two points of
interest about each of them.</p></div></div>
