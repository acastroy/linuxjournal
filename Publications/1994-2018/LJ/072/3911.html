    Some clues for protecting your privacy on the Internet.

restaurant, &ldquo;Chez Marcel&rdquo;. Please, sit down. This month, the
special is Internets and Intranets. The world, you see, has become
a very small place, with every other person or business spinning a
web site. Even Chez Marcel is considering opening the restaurant to
the world, but Fran&ccedil;ois feels it would spoil the intimate
nature of the place.
</p><p>Fran&ccedil;ois! What are you doing sitting around? Wine for
our guests. Vite! Vite!</p><p>While Fran&ccedil;ois is getting your Chablis, I would like
to tell you about the features on tonight's menu&mdash;cookie cutters,
munchers and crunchers. Now, I am well aware that my fellow
columnist, Reuven Lerner, once provided you with a recipe for
making cookies (see &ldquo;At the Forge&rdquo; in <i  >LJ</i>
issue 45). What I want to do today is share recipes for destroying
or deleting cookies. After all, too many cookies can be quite
fattening, non?</p><p>Before sampling our first item, it might be interesting to
delve into a history and explanation of the cookie. Internet
cookies are sometimes called &ldquo;magic cookies&rdquo; and should in no way
be confused with &ldquo;magic mushrooms&rdquo;, since Internet cookies are
not edible. Cookies are simply small text files transmitted to your
browser (or system) when you visit a web site. Cookies do nothing
on your system, other than sit there. This is because, as I
mentioned before you finished off that last glass of wine,
<span   class="emphasis"><em>cookies are just text</em></span>--no code or
programs.</p><p>The whole idea behind cookies was that a server would give
you a cookie as a marker to indicate where you had previously
visited. That cookie might store a user name and password to access
a particular web site. (Sites will often&mdash;but not always&mdash;have this
information encoded so that somebody viewing your cookie file would
see only what appears to be junk text. Have a look at your own
cookie file.) When you next visit the site, the server would ask
you whether it had served you any cookies, and your browser would
reply by sending the cookies from before. In this way, the web site
would recognize you, directing you to your virtual table. You see,
no web site, no matter how clever, has Fran&ccedil;ois to recognize
you as you walk in.</p><p>Originally, cookies were left by a site and picked up by the
same site, allowing for a kind of interactive session. For example,
after a long night of shopping at your favorite web store, you
decide to pack it in and come back in the morning. The next day,
the store's web site requests the cookies it left with you and
&ldquo;knows&rdquo; that you had three pounds of cheese, two jars of Dijon
mustard and a nice Cabernet in your shopping cart. Cookies can be
quite useful, as you see.</p><p>The problem is that cookies can also be shared within larger
domains, such as advertising rings. Using these shared cookies,
advertisers can build a profile of your likes and dislikes,
tailoring and targeting advertising to you specifically. After a
while, every site you visit that deals with certain banner
advertisers knows your weakness for Brie, and in no time, you are
broke. Your privacy has been compromised, so that others may offer
to sell you what you cannot resist. Many people object to this
method of building user profiles, and consider the use of cookies
to be quite unethical. If you are concerned about cookies, consider
the following items from our menu.</p><p>The easiest way of all is <span   class="emphasis"><em>simply to refuse all
cookies</em></span> in the browser itself. If you are using
Netscape, click on &ldquo;Edit&rdquo;, then choose &ldquo;Preferences&rdquo;. In the
window that pops up, look to the left-hand menu. Click on
&ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; and select the level at which you want to handle
cookies. Notice that you can refuse cookies entirely, accept them
all at face value, or request that you be warned before the browser
accepts them. (See Figure 1.) You can also further specify this
behavior based on whether the cookie originated on the server of
the page being viewed. In other words, no cookies from a banner
advertising server or any other hosts being linked to by the site
you are visiting.</p><div       class="mediaobject"><a href="3911f1.large.jpg"><img src="3911f1.jpg"></a><div class="caption"><p>
Figure 1. Netscape's Cookie Dialog
</p></div></div><p>If you don't want to bother with selecting this cookie or
that cookie, you may find the next items more to your taste. After
all, clicking &ldquo;OK&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; over and over again when
visiting a page that serves up dozens of cookies can be tiring. How
do we avoid this?</p><p>You could do it the hard way. Each time you want to launch
your browser, remove the cookies file from your user name's
.netscape directory and start Netscape. Allow me to demonstrate,
non?</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rm -f ~/.netscape/cookies
</pre><p>The tilde character (~) is a way of referring to your home
directory. The <b  >$HOME</b> variable also works here.
This simple command will do a nice job of cleaning things up. Then,
just click on your Netscape icon, or start Netscape from the
command line. You could also do what I did, and write a very simple
shell script to do the job. Let's call it &ldquo;netscape_clean&rdquo;. It
would look something like this:
<pre     class="programlisting">
#!/bin/bash
# This starts Netscape with a clean cookie file.
rm -f ~/.netscape/cookies
/usr/bin/netscape
</pre>


Keep in mind that the path to the
<span   class="bold"><b>netscape</b></span> executable may vary from
system to system. On my system, it lives under /usr/bin.
</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, cookies can be quite useful, so
simply removing everything is not necessarily the way to go. Tech
support web sites may not be able to process your queries, web
stores and their shopping carts may simply not work, or content may
be refused to you entirely. You may want to be more selective in
what you destroy.</p><p>The recipe shown in Listing 1 requires a little Perl for
added bite. You still need to run this outside of your current
browser session. The difference here is you will be prompted, line
by line, for cookies you wish to keep. If they appear to be what
you want, simply answer with a capital &ldquo;A&rdquo; for &ldquo;Accept&rdquo; and
continue on. The sharper eyes will note that to delete a cookie
from the active file, you need only press <b  >RETURN</b>
or <b  >ENTER</b>. Et voil&lt;\#224&gt;! A much leaner
cookies file, filled with only nutritious information.</p><p><a href="3911l1.html" target="_self">Listing 1</a></p><p>Of course, you do not have to do it this way, but my Perl
script should serve as a great starting point for you to season to
your tastes. One idea might be to add a check for the Netscape
comment lines at the top of the file, so that you would not need to
accept or delete these. They would simply be copied into the other
file. Then again, perhaps not. They are simply comments, and my
Netscape program re-adds them if they are missing.</p><p>After experimenting with the above recipe, I decided to
strike out into the very heart of the Web itself in order to
provide you, my esteemed guests, with an alternative recipe. My
travels took me to LinuxBerg where a search on the word &ldquo;cookie&rdquo;
brought me to Phil Darnowsky's &ldquo;cookiecutter&rdquo;, another Perl
script that includes a &ldquo;ban and allow&rdquo; list. His script takes a
different approach from my own creation, but the results are the
same&mdash;no cookies you do not want.</p><p>Before I wrap up this month's column, might I suggest that
your on-line privacy may be more important than simply deciding who
can collect information on you via cookies. There are other ways to
track your surfing habits and, to some degree, your identity,
simply by asking your browser for information. For a demonstration
of this, check out Privacy.Net's Anonymizer privacy analysis at
<a href="http://privacy.net/anonymizer" target="_self">http://privacy.net/anonymizer/</a>.
You may find it quite fascinating (and maybe a bit scary) to sample
what a site can discover about you and the system you are
running.</p><p>How does one block such information, you ask? One way is to
run a proxy between your browser and the rest of the world. One
example is the Internet Junkbusters Proxy, a program released under
the GPL that is available for Linux and a number of other
platforms.</p><p>You may also wish to completely block all your surfing from
prying eyes by doing it behind a service provided for just such
anonymity. This is where the Anonymizer comes into play. Using this
company's service (they offer both a free and a premium service),
you can enter the page you want to visit into the form provided and
surf completely <span   class="emphasis"><em>incognito</em></span>.</p><p>These methods of securing your anonymity on the Web extend
beyond the realm of the cookie, but the cookie remains a
fascinating beast. If you want to know about all things cookie, you
should pay Cookie Central a visit. This site contains a wealth of
information about Internet cookies.</p><p>Well, mes amis, that terrible horloge on the wall tells me it
is once again nearly closing time. Before you go, consider trying a
fun little demonstration of the cookie&mdash;pay a visit to
Privacy.Net's cookie page at
<a href="http://privacy.net/cookies" target="_self">privacy.net/cookies</a>.
I mention this one because, as part of the demonstration, they will
&ldquo;bake&rdquo; your favourite cookie for you (in a virtual sense). Your
chef admits to being a bit of a sucker for Fig Newtons, which was
my choice. Your tastes may be different. Chocolate chip,
perhaps?</p><p>Au revoir, mes amis. Remember, you are always welcome here at
<span   class="emphasis"><em>Chez Marcel</em></span>. Bon App&eacute;tit!</p><p><a href="3911s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
