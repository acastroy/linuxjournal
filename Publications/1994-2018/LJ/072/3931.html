has written in his article &ldquo;Musings on Linux Profiteering&rdquo;
published on the <i  >Linux Journal</i> web site
(<a href="../000/5233.html" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/articles/misc/012.html</a>).
I've always had the same fears and beliefs, especially because of
the love I feel for GNU/Linux, the one and only OS that actually
<span   class="emphasis"><em>came</em></span> to me, without asking me for money or
anything&mdash;on the contrary, offering me great amounts of knowledge I
wouldn't have with another OS. The moment I noticed the existence
of GNU/Linux, a big change was made in the course of my life. In a
country where you have to pay to get proper education, these things
mean a lot to all of us&mdash;the people who don't have the resources to
pay for private education. Not only to us, but to all people who in
some way work with computers, providing a way to expand and improve
our knowledge.</p><p>That's why I fear the monster of money so much, and the harm
it could cause the entire GNU/Linux community. And this is why I'm
not using FreeBSD, regardless of its good aspects: its license
promotes commercial development, allowing anyone to prohibit the
use of the software to someone like me, who does not have the
resources to pay for software.</p><p>Thanks a lot for the article; it could help people realize
how much they have to protect.</p><p>&mdash;Pablo Baena greyheart@fnmail.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2455580.0x254d558"></a>Love that Penguin</h2></div></div><p>It was great to see Feathers McGraw featured on your magazine
cover. I accidentally discovered Wallace and Gromit while flipping
channels a few years ago. PBS was playing two of Nick Park's
features; we later purchased a tape of &ldquo;The Wrong Trousers&rdquo;.
These movies have become favorites of the entire family. The Linux
box I set up at work is named Feathers after this character,
because he's an outlaw. Hopefully that will soon change.</p><p>&mdash;Steve Brant steve@brant.nu</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2455580.0x254d6b8"></a>Upgrade Error</h2></div></div><p>Kirk Petersen's &ldquo;Using the Red Hat Package Manager&rdquo;
(January 2000) is a nice article, but has one problem. In the
paragraph on &ldquo;Upgrade Mode&rdquo;, the example given:</p><pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -u penguin-3.26.i386.rpm
</pre><p>will return the following error messages: &ldquo;error: --u and
-uninstall are deprecated and no longer work.&rdquo; and &ldquo;Error: Use -e
or -erase instead.&rdquo; At least, it will if you use RPM version 3.0.2
as I do. The command:
<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -Uvh penguin-3.26.i386.rpm
</pre>


would work much better. The man page is not very clear, but the
info page calls it out correctly.

Public Trust&rdquo; (<i  >LJ</i> web site,
<a href="../000/4979.html" target="_self">http://www.linuxjournal.com/articles/buzz/027.html</a>).
How timely it seems, given the announcement today of the Linux Open
Source Expo &amp; Conference Program to be held in Sydney,
Australia in March. All the &ldquo;big names&rdquo; of the Linux world will
be there, with keynote addresses by Robert Bishop of SGI and Robert
Young of Red Hat, Inc. Bob Young's credentials include &ldquo;a career
in the computer finance arena, with 20 years of computer industry
finance and marketing... which allowed him to see an opportunity
with a phenomenon called Linux in 1993.&rdquo; And here I was, thinking
these guys were just hackers in suits!</p><p>By the way, the price of a ticket on this gravy train is
$1350 AUS. For an extra $125, you can attend the TUXedo Night,
featuring none other than John &ldquo;maddog&rdquo; Hall. How many other
Linux luminaries are attending? Only time will tell. Perhaps one
(or more) <i  >Linux Journal</i> staff would also like
to attend, if only to let the rest of us poorer Linux users know
how the other half live. Public Trust? I'll drink to that, but with
a virtual beer, at home in front of my computer.</p><p>Thanks for what is still an informative and enjoyable
magazine, even if the suits appear to be more numerous these
days.</p><p>&mdash;Laurie Darerough planet@ozemail.com.au</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2455580.0x254e0b0"></a>Spinning the Web</h2></div></div><p>I read with interest Doc Searls' comments on operating
systems being used on web servers (upFRONT, January 2000). My own
site is being hosted by Virtualis, and they use FreeBSD quite
extensively for virtual hosting. Their dedicated servers come with
two options, namely NT/FreeBSD. Upon enquiring for a client, one of
the support staff for Virtualis stated that NT is buggy as far as
virtual hosting is concerned.</p><p>To come back to the Media Metrix survey, two of the five
sites being hosted on NT belong to Microsoft&mdash;namely, msn.com and
microsoft.com. I guess one can ignore those two, which brings the
NT tally to 3...</p><p>Thanks for a most enjoyable magazine!</p><p>&mdash;Johan Pretorius JohanPretorius@flysaa.com</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2455580.0x254e2c0"></a>Ranting and Raving</h2></div></div><p>Do you wanna know what really pisses me off about Linux? It's
touted as a &ldquo;free&rdquo; OS (in other words, you can get it without
paying a cent) but it's obviously <span   class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>. I'd
like to try Linux and see if it really <span   class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a
good competitor to Windows. I understand there is <span   class="emphasis"><em>very
little</em></span> software sold that can actually run under Linux,
but I am still interested to see how the OS works. My question is
simple: why pay some vendor my hard-earned money for an OS that
finding software for is such a chore? And why should I trust anyone
that says &ldquo;it's free&rdquo; and then wants to charge me for it?! I
understand it costs money to make and distribute CD-ROMs, but why
can't I simply download it if it really is free? Your web site
<span   class="emphasis"><em>says</em></span> I can, yet I see no link to the FTP site.
It doesn't take a brain surgeon to spot this lie.</p><p>As for Windows, I firmly believe Microsoft
<span   class="emphasis"><em>earned</em></span> their market share by the fact that
they created a terrific OS that a vast majority of computer users
love. It's called supply and demand (duh). Yet I tend to scratch my
head in wonder when I hear about some OS that's being touted as
better (more stable), and free (when I can't even find the free
software on the Internet) and <span   class="emphasis"><em>especially</em></span> when
I don't see software that says it works under Linux. Usually, when
a better product exists, there is a very competitive market for it
(such as cars&mdash;Ford and GM are a perfect example).</p><p>My conclusion is this: Linux is nothing more than a cult
following, like Apple's Macintosh. Mac users are cut from a strange
cloth. They seem to insist on using a Mac, simply because they want
to be different. They also appear to hate Microsoft, just because
Microsoft has created some of the best software on Earth and
<span   class="emphasis"><em>millions</em></span> of people gobbled it up like turkey
sales at Thanksgiving.</p><p>As for the (corrupted) Justice Dept. vs. Microsoft... well,
just because someone makes a superior product that has overwhelming
customer demand doesn't make them a criminal enterprise.</p><p>&mdash;Scott Moore scottbomb@hotmail.com</p><p>Actually, we didn't think it took a brain surgeon to find
Linux on the Internet. Just click on our &ldquo;How to Get Linux&rdquo;
button, and you will find many download sites. More and more
software products support Linux every day. Check out the ads in our
magazine and the Linux Software Map at
