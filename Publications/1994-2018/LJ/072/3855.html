    An outline of key test areas to identify security issues in a
    web application and provide measures to minimize them.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a0f450"></a></h2></div></div><p>Web sites are moving away from static
HTML to dynamic interactive web applications. It is the dynamic,
interactive web application that is making the Internet the
universal medium. Web applications bring a new level of risk to web
sites. Security of these web applications is paramount to the
security of the site.
</p><p>Awareness of security threats from the Internet is increasing
the adoption of secure technologies. Deploying firewalls is a
standard first step adopted by many organizations. Firewalls
protect against many attacks on the network and system
infrastructure. In addition, some firewalls provide filtering
capability and contain inbound malicious Java and Active-X
applications. However, firewalls do little to protect against
inbound malicious requests to legitimate applications. Web-based
applications are very popular due to the ubiquity of the Internet.
Providing access to customer information, user profiles, financial
records and health records are common examples of services that web
applications can provide. Most often, these applications access a
back-end database to serve dynamically generated content to the
users. Applications designed without security in mind may result in
loss of data integrity, availability, confidentiality and
privacy.</p><p>Most web application testing can be classified as static or
dynamic. Static testing involves manually inspecting the source
code and automatically testing for dangerous constructs. On the
other hand, dynamic testing involves executing the web application
to detect anomalous behavior on unexpected inputs. The focus of
this article is on dynamic testing.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a0f608"></a>The Malicious Intent</h2></div></div><p>Some information seekers think maliciously. Hackers are
sometimes able to anticipate inadequacies and the coding practices
adopted by programmers. Often, the &ldquo;speed to market&rdquo; attitude
pushes application developers to overlook standard and secure
coding practices. This is especially true in the e-commerce
environment, where standard practices such as Change Management are
often overlooked. Security is thus usually an afterthought. Often,
this results in a vulnerable first release of an application. The
process of fixing the vulnerabilities is a fairly expensive
one.</p><p>Code templates and examples in different development
environments provide developers with an approach to implement the
desired functionality. These code snippets may not, however,
account for application security. The malicious user is sometimes
able to identify the development environment just by viewing the
HTML code generated by a web application. Comments and some HTML
tags can provide information on the development environment. Upon
identifying the development environment, a malicious user is able
to exploit vulnerabilities where the example or template may have
been used.</p><p>Another common area for exploitation is the way the
application maintains session state information. The HyperText
Transport Protocol (HTTP) by itself is stateless. Cookies are
commonly used to maintain state information between subsequent HTTP
requests. Cookies are simply sets of strings written to the browser
by the web application server. They are used to maintain session
state, remember passwords and user names, for personalization and
configuration features. A malicious user could hijack applications
that do not implement strong session controls.</p><p>Application vulnerabilities are important because they give
access to confidential information such as credit card numbers,
account numbers or names and customer lists, without having to
break into the web server. The difference between a malicious user
and a regular user is <span   class="emphasis"><em>intent</em></span>.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a0f870"></a>Are You At Risk?</h2></div></div><p>In a recent incident that stunned the on-line community, a
hacker posted up to 25,000 stolen credit-card numbers on a public
web site (see Resources). These numbers were stolen from the CD
Universe web site. The hacker claims to be in possession of more
than 300,000 credit card numbers from this site. Further, the
hacker claimed that the credit card numbers were compromised due to
a flaw in the software used to process credit card transactions.
Are you at risk? It depends. You may be at risk if:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>You are a large corporation that attracts many
users to your corporate web site.</p></li><li><p>You have just released a statement boasting about
the security of your site.</p></li><li><p>You are completing and releasing a new product in
the marketplace.</p></li><li><p>You are a financial institution.</p></li><li><p>You are a government organization.</p></li><li><p>You are a provider of many knowledge-related or
data services.</p></li><li><p>You are an e-commerce site.</p></li></ul></div><p>If you do not fit any of the above categories, you may still
be vulnerable. In the event of a compromise, only your
organization's data classification policy and the value of the data
lost will determine the extent of the damage. Just last year, the
numbers of web site defacements rose over 900% (see Resources).
This can result in embarrassment and unnecessary media exposure.
Some publicly traded companies have seen their stock value go down
as a result of a breach in the security of their web site.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a0fef8"></a>Securing the Applications</h2></div></div><p>Now we know in theory how a malicious user thinks. We also
have some idea about who may be at risk. The remainder of this
article will focus on security issues and measures that can be
implemented by web site developers in protecting an organization's
assets. This is important because the web site administrators
cannot easily enforce the client-side security measures. What
follows is a list and description of security-related
exposures.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a10000"></a>Cookie Poisoning</h2></div></div><p>A cookie is a small piece of data which is sent from a web
server to a web browser when that browser visits the server's site.
The cookie is stored on the user's machine, but it is not an
executable program and cannot do anything to that machine. However,
cookies may allow a malicious user to hijack web sessions and view,
modify or otherwise exploit the information related to another
user's session. A hacker may obtain the cookie by various means,
including physical access or network sniffing, as well as guessing
the cookie's contents. Next, the hacker can try to impersonate the
user by hijacking the user's sessions. This is an especially
serious issue with shared workstations, cyber caf&eacute;s and
public kiosk environments.</p><p>Sometimes cookies are used to store information such as user
host name, password, account ID, session ID and other user profile
information. Cookies are often used to maintain session information
between the user and his shopping cart. Two types of cookies
exist:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Persistent cookies</b></span>
have an expiration date and are stored on a user's hard disk until
that date. A persistent cookie can be used to track a user's
browsing habits by identifying her whenever she returns to a
site.</p></li><li><p><span   class="bold"><b>Non-persistent
cookies</b></span> are stored in the web browser's memory. They
last only until the browser is closed and are then
destroyed.</p></li></ul></div><p>If a user is able to capture the cookies by sniffing on the
network, or by any other means, he may be able to gain unauthorized
access to personal information, including credit card number,
passwords, user ID and mailing address.
</p><p>The security measures you can take are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Use non-persistent cookies instead of persistent
cookies.</p></li><li><p>If you must use persistent cookies, then specify a
short duration for the cookie's life. The longer the time until
cookie expiration, the larger the risk.</p></li><li><p>Avoid application features that use persistent
cookies to store privacy-related information. Example: &ldquo;Please
check to remember user name and password.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p>Use the secure tag, so that the cookie is sent only
if a secure channel (https) is being used.</p></li><li><p>Encrypt the information in the cookies. Some web
sites split one cookie into many cookies that are further
encrypted.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a10840"></a>Form Manipulation</h2></div></div><p>Very simply, form manipulation involves saving a web site's
form and editing it off-line. Many times, this involves adding more
entries to pull-down lists or increasing the size of text fields.
The intent is usually to cause a buffer overflow on the server. In
the past, client-side form validation has been used to offload the
performance load from the server. While client-side validation is a
good technique from a performance point of view, it is not the
preferred solution from a security point of view. Poorly designed
web applications may contain hidden fields that contain user IDs,
account IDs or other key fields that define user sessions. Again,
all this information can be manipulated off-line to gain access to
another user's session.</p><p>Form manipulation is a simple technique and requires only a
knowledge of HTML. Experienced programmers may be able to alter and
submit forms by guessing the server-side code used to process the
forms.</p><p>The following measures should be implemented to improve the
security of an application against form manipulation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Perform referrer checks on the server side. This
will ensure that a given form was reached from the page that
contains the hyperlink providing access to the form.</p></li><li><p>Do not rely on the form field-length checks or
JavaScript to ensure form input integrity. Perform form
input-length checks on the server as well.</p></li><li><p>Process and validate the form input field values
entered by the user for range, expected input (e.g., numeric vs.
alphabets), strange characters and any other associations specific
to the user.</p></li><li><p>Do not store critical user information in hidden
fields in the form.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a075a0"></a>Bypassing Intermediate Forms in a Multiple-Form
Set</h2></div></div><p>Sometimes forms are filled out in sequence. This may be
necessary because the information provided in one form is used to
take the user to the next form in the web application.
Additionally, the entire web application may be divided into
multiple forms for ease of use.</p><p>Malicious users may be able to bypass the intermediate forms
by typing out the entire form name in the browser URL field instead
of using the navigation controls provided by the web site pages.
This may result in unexpected application behavior, accessing a
defunct application, incomplete database records or buffer
overflow.</p><p>Security measures you can take are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Ensure the user progresses to the next form only
after all the required information requested in the preceding forms
is provided. Furthermore, ensure the user visited all preceding
forms.</p></li><li><p>Perform referrer checks on the server side. This
will ensure a given form was reached from the page that contains
the hyperlink providing access to the form.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a07910"></a>Embedded Queries to a Relational
Database</h2></div></div><p>Many times, form fields are used to send input provided by
users to the back end web site for further processing. For example,
a user may input their user ID or full name to list information
pertaining to their user account. Once the web server receives this
information, it will issue a query to a relational database. The
results of the query are displayed to the user.</p><p>A malicious user may input field entries in such a way that
the returned result provides additional information about other
users as well. In addition, the embedded queries may run other SQL
commands, such as pipe commands, which may result in disclosure of
confidential information.</p><p>Security measures you can take are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The web application must carefully examine the
input fields used to create the database queries for illegal
characters, for example an asterisk (*).</p></li><li><p>Validate and ensure that input fields contain only
the relevant user-related information.</p></li><li><p>Ensure proper permissions exist on the database
objects accessed by the web application.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a07d30"></a>Session Timeouts</h2></div></div><p>Many site administrators feel secure simply because the site
is using SSL for all its sessions. SSL provides for data
transmission security between the web client and the web server.
Once an SSL session is established, all information exchanged
between the web server and the web client is encrypted. The session
timeout specifies the &ldquo;no activity&rdquo; duration beyond which the
user will have to re-authenticate himself to the web site. The
session timeout is usually based on the type of application.
Serious financial institutions may specify a very short session
timeout period. Regular applications, such as web-based e-mail, may
use longer timeout periods.</p><p>A malicious user may be able to hijack another user's session
if session timeouts are too long. The implications of this are
widespread, ranging from embarrassment to loss of confidentiality
and integrity of user information. This is a major issue in kiosk,
cyber caf&eacute;, laboratory and shared workstation
environments.</p><p>Your security measure is to evaluate carefully the session
timeouts for your application. If you are using multiple
application servers, then ensure the session timeouts for the
multiple applications are consistent with the timeouts determined
for the entire web site.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a07ee8"></a>Directory Listing</h2></div></div><p>Most servers are configured with automatic directory listing.
This means any directory that does not contain any of the default
files (for example, index.htm or default.htm) served by the server
will display the contents of the directory. This is dangerous for
directories where CGI program sources or executables reside.
Further, these directories may contain other files (for example,
files with the ~ prefix or the .bak suffix) that may provide more
information on the web-site application.</p><p>Malicious users may be able to browse the directories and
download key files. Files that contain source code may be examined
to identify trap doors to gain access into the web server or
applications.</p><p>The security measures you can take are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Configure the web server to specify all default
files that may be used and to disable directory browsing.</p></li><li><p>Establish proper procedures when adding the
web-application files.</p></li><li><p>Ensure that unnecessary files are periodically
removed.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0x2917580.0x2a08308"></a>Summary</h2></div></div><p>Dynamic content on web sites will continue to enhance the
business functionality of web sites; it is supported by a growing
number of e-commerce sites. Also, these web applications are
increasingly connected to databases that were previously accessible
only through internally built custom applications. Malicious
individuals can exploit these web-based applications to gain access
to privileged information. Several simple methods, such as cookie
poisoning and forms manipulation, can be used to exploit poorly
designed web applications; most often, just a text editor and a
browser are sufficient. The tools used to execute the exploits are
easily available and require minimal knowledge. The very same tools
and methods may be used to test the robustness of web
applications.</p><p>An exhaustive testing of web applications will require
building test scenarios to identify vulnerabilities. Proper
web-application designs, web-server configuration, secure
programming practices and good housekeeping are necessary for the
security of any web site and a site's privileged resources. Due to
the custom nature of web applications, they pose a challenge to the
security of web sites. In the future, web applications are expected
to be more secure, as certified components used to build
applications gain support. For now, we will have to rely on both
static and dynamic testing of web applications.</p><p><a href="3855s1.html" target="_self">Resources</a></p></div></div>
