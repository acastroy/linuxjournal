who use RPM-based distributions (Red Hat, Caldera, Mandrake, SuSE,
etc.). Or is it? You may have noticed that RPMs from one
distribution don't always work on another. They don't install due
to dependency problems (even though they would run just fine), or
they install but segfault (library incompatibilities), etc. So you
grab a .src.rpm file, and try to build it. Often, that doesn't work
because some distributions have seen fit to make slight alterations
to their version of RPM. What about those who can't even build an
RPM .spec file and the patches required? Well, you might want to
check out
<a href="http://specs.pananix.net" target="_self">http://specs.pananix.net/</a>.
The .spec and patch files are thin at the moment, but with help
from the RPM community, this could be a great site for grabbing a
.spec file and patches that work for your distribution. Hopefully,
all that's required is the software archive file, the .spec and
patches. The command
<pre     class="programlisting">
rpm -bb &amp;&amp; rpm -i ../RPMS/i386/
</pre>


should do the trick.
</p><p>webnotebook:
<a href="http://www.entropia.com.mx/~roadmr/webnotebook" target="_self">http://www.entropia.com.mx/~roadmr/webnotebook/</a></p><p>This is a small web notebook with fields for subject and
body. It automatically adds the creation date, modification date
and a note number. <span   class="bold"><b>webnotebook</b></span> is
similar to <span   class="bold"><b>note</b></span>, but is used via a
web browser (lynx works just fine). You can search for any term,
and the notes found will be listed. Searching on nothing returns
everything. Unlike note, which sorts on note number, the default
sort in webnotebook is the modification date (latest first). It
requires MySQL server, web server configured for CGI, Perl and the
Perl DBI/DBD module.</p><p>darxite:
<a href="http://darxite.cjb.net" target="_self">http://darxite.cjb.net/</a></p><p>Much like Downloader for X, this program will download a
number of files. While slightly more complex than Downloader for X,
<span   class="bold"><b>darxite</b></span> runs a daemon in the
background, which you can connect to in order to pass URLs for
downloading (including downloading directories recursively).
Several client programs, for X and the command line, can be used to
pass commands, URLs and monitor download progress. This program
will continue downloading even after you log out. It requires
libpthread and glibc.</p><p>AoNettool:
<a href="http://134.130.48.9/~alex/AoNettools-0.9a-rev1.tar.gz" target="_self">134.130.48.9/~alex/AoNettools-0.9a-rev1.tar.gz</a></p><p>This tool is a Tcl/Tk front end for
<span   class="bold"><b>ping</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>traceroute</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>nslookup</b></span>,
<span   class="bold"><b>finger</b></span> and
<span   class="bold"><b>whois</b></span>. Output is displayed in the
window and can be saved for future reference. This tool works well
for those not accustomed to a command line. I would only add
<b  >netstat</b> <b  >-rn</b>,
<b  >netstat</b> <b  >-an</b> and
<span   class="bold"><b>ifconfig</b></span> to have a relatively
complete set of tools for viewing the network status of the host.
It requires Tcl/Tk.</p><p>Advanced Packet Sniffer:
<a href="http://www.swrtec.de" target="_self">http://www.swrtec.de/</a></p><p>This packet sniffer provides a wealth of information about
packets on your network, as well as a display of the entire packet.
The header is put into human-readable form and presented, starting
with the MAC address. A number of options are available, such as
whether to include or exclude a particular MAC or IP address. This
sniffer can be run only by root, but that constitutes a fairly good
reason not to allow rogue Linux systems on your network. It
requires glibc.</p><p>filetraq:
<a href="http://filetraq.xidus.net" target="_self">http://filetraq.xidus.net/</a></p><p>This particular utility seeks to replace the no-longer-free
<span   class="bold"><b>tripwire</b></span>, but
<span   class="bold"><b>filetraq</b></span> works from a slightly
different perspective. Rather than track large numbers of files
daily, it looks for changes in a few key files at very short
intervals. Changes in any of these files are reported via e-mail
when the change is detected. Key files include one of /etc/passwd
or /etc/shadow and a few others, such as /etc/services and
/etc/inetd.conf and easily editable startup files. Basically,
filetraq uses <span   class="bold"><b>diff</b></span> to compare the
file against the database, so you could include /bin/login also. It
requires bash and recommends
<span   class="bold"><b>cron</b></span>.</p><p>anteater:
<a href="http://www.profzone.ch/anteater" target="_self">http://www.profzone.ch/anteater/</a></p><p>This utility will search through your mail log file using
<span   class="bold"><b>grep</b></span> and display important
statistics gleaned from that file: largest messages, source of most
messages, etc. One problem this particular utility suffers from is
the lack of a usage message. Both <b  >-h</b> and help
tell you to read the manual, but the manual isn't installed with
the software&mdash;an oversight, I'm sure. It requires libstdc++, libm
and glibc.</p><p>nutcrack:
<a href="http://www.birdnest.org/zzrhear" target="_self">http://www.birdnest.org/zzrhear/</a></p><p>It has been awhile since a new password-cracking program has
appeared. The ones currently available are difficult to compile or
require mega-swap space and more resources than most modest systems
have. <span   class="bold"><b>nutcrack</b></span> is quick. One
caution: the dictionary used is extremely important. I created a
new account, and used the account name as the password&mdash;it wasn't
caught. So, be sure to add the contents of your password file (user
name and GECOS field) to the dictionary. It requires Perl and a
good dictionary file.</p><p>weedlog:
<a href="http://www.firepool.com/weedlog" target="_self">http://www.firepool.com/weedlog/</a></p><p>This particular daemon is yet another IP logger, but with one
big difference: unlike many loggers, this one does not rely on
promiscuous mode and logs the packets in an easily understood,
human-readable format (configurable). This makes for fewer mistakes
when manually reading the log, and it can be machine-processed
easily. You can choose among logging TCP, UDP, ICMP or IGMP (or any
combination). Caution: if you get many simultaneous connections,
you will see a <span   class="bold"><b>weedlog</b></span> spawned to
report each one (it will die, but you could end up with a very
large process table). It requires libpthread and glibc.</p></div></div>
