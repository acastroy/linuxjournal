    Discover the joys of using the new technology of DSL and
    cable modems to make your link to the world.
    </p></div></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbc580.0xdb4558"></a></h2></div></div><p>The idea seemed simple enough: I wanted
to get a high-speed Internet connection at home, preferably using
DSL (digital subscriber line). Thinking a quick phone call and a
few hundred bucks in connection/installation fees would do the
trick, I found instead that the business is still in its infancy
and mired in a not-so-nice competition between telephone companies
(telcos), DSL providers, cable providers and ISPs. There is a lot
of money to be made and monopoly theories already abound. These
have brought in the FCC, special-interest groups and others. It
really is a mess. This is cutting-edge technology that may soon
connect a majority of computer users to the Internet, and yet
again, big businesses are too concerned with private interests.
Legal wrangling will continue to delay the expansion of service and
lead to much frustration for those waiting.
</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbc580.0xdb4660"></a>What are the Options?</h2></div></div><p>When I began to research alternatives for high-speed access,
I felt DSL service was the best solution. We use it here at
<i  >Linux Journal</i> and the speed of the connection
is wonderful. For no particular reason, I had a negative opinion
toward a similar service offered through cable companies. I was
surprised by what I found. As it turns out, cable has advanced
quite a bit more than DSL service&mdash;there are over two million
subscribers to cable, and only some 500,000 to DSL services
nationwide
(<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/ctg704.htm" target="_self">www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/ctg704.htm</a>).
Both DSL service and cable are viable options.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbc580.0xdb4818"></a>What is DSL?</h2></div></div><p>DSL is technology that uses ordinary copper phone wires to
transmit high-bandwidth information to homes and small businesses.
Your phone company receives information in analog and digital form.
Digital information is converted to analog (voice) information and
sent to your computer. Your modem converts the analog information
back to digital. With DSL technology, the phone company can send
digital information directly to your computer as digital data (you
need a DSL modem, actually, a router), which allows for a more
efficient use of bandwidth. Most importantly, the signals are
separated, allowing you to talk on the phone and surf the Web at
the same time.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbc580.0xdb4920"></a>Speed</h2></div></div><p>The main advantages of DSL are speed and always-on Internet
access. Having used DSL service here at work, I no longer have the
patience for &ldquo;old&rdquo; dial-up modems. On Whatis.com, I found the
statement &ldquo;Using DSL, up to 6.1 megabits per second of data can be
sent downstream and up to 640Kbps upstream.&rdquo; This will
dramatically improve the speed of your Internet connection&mdash;as much
as 25 times faster than a 56k modem, according to US West&mdash;and
without all the horrible squeaks and scratches of a modem. With a
DSL line, you can quietly and quickly zip through the Internet,
download images or just surf at your leisure.</p><p>The service I could afford would provide a 384Kbps downstream
connection and a 128Kbps upstream connection. This is called ADSL
(asymmetric), since different speeds are used for the downstream
connection (the data sent to the user) and the upstream connection
(the user requests). Requesting data uses little bandwidth, but the
transmission of video, audio and 3-D images requires more.
Splitting bandwidth in this manner allows for a small portion of
the downstream connection to be used for phone conversations.
Imagine being able to talk on the phone to a friend while checking
out the same web site, or sending a fax without having to
disconnect from the Net!</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbc580.0xdb4a80"></a>Requirements and Cost</h2></div></div><p>On average, DSL service runs between $30 and $60 per month.
The initial installation and activation fees can be $300 or more,
but special offers abound. The service I chose will cost $60 per
month and has an eight-week waiting period before installation. As
far as hardware is concerned, I need a router and an Ethernet card.
You can spend close to $250 on a router and another $50 for the
Ethernet card. If you are technically inclined, handling the
installation of the router and Ethernet card yourself can save you
as much as $200. The router or &ldquo;DSL modem&rdquo; runs about $250, but
again, rebates and special offers seem common. My initial fees
after all the rebates, etc. would be around $250, which seems
reasonable.</p><p>Frustration comes from having to pay $60 per month. Our
Editor in Chief, Marjorie Richardson, lives a mere 20 blocks from
me, but falls within US West coverage. She pays $30 per month, and
US West supplied the router and Ethernet card (initial fee $140). I
pay more because I am not within US West coverage, and therefore
subscribe through the competition. I would go through Covad
Communications, who leases the lines from US West. Then Covad
recommends an ISP (oz.net), and I get a headache&mdash;three companies
to deal with! This is very common and leads to customer service
problems. If I have a problem with my service, I would first call
my ISP who might say the problem is with the DSL provider (in my
case, Covad), who might then point a finger at US West in an
endless round of blame-placing, rather than trying to find a
solution.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbc580.0xdb4be0"></a>The G.lite Standard</h2></div></div><p>It has been more than a year since the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) voted in favor of making G.lite ADSL
(or ADSL Lite) standard
(<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/pcwtoday/article/0,1510,8546,00.html" target="_self">www.pcworld.com/pcwtoday/article/0,1510,8546,00.html</a>).
This <span   class="emphasis"><em>PC World</em></span> article states, &ldquo;The G.Lite
modem standard, called G.992.2, uses a stripped-down version of
asymmetric digital subscriber line.&rdquo; The connection is a bit
slower than full-rate ADSL, but, according to ADSL Forum
(<a href="http://adsl.com" target="_self">http://adsl.com/</a>), &ldquo;the
full-rate standard is more costly and problematic. Installation
requires the phone company to come out and install a splitter on
your phone line.&rdquo; With the G.lite modem, this feature is installed
into the modem, leaving only the installation of the modem to the
customer. This keeps costs down for both customers and telcos,
which is why many in the industry expect the G.lite modem to
prosper.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbc580.0xdb4df0"></a>And Then There was Cable</h2></div></div><p>Cable is currently more popular and more readily available
than DSL service. Currently, cable modem services are capable of
reaching nearly 52 percent of U.S. households, compared to just 23
percent for telephone companies (John Borland, CNET News.com,
1/13/00). This trend is expected to continue for a few years, but
by 2003, twice as many DSL installations as cable are forecast. The
cited reason is phone lines are more available, especially in
business districts (&ldquo;Cable vs. DSL&rdquo;, <span   class="emphasis"><em>Seattle
Times</em></span>, May 2, 1999). There are those who would disagree,
believing cable's current market position will only increase. AOL's
recent acquisition of Time Warner could be evidence enough to
support such claims. With access to Time Warner's cable lines, many
believe AOL will place a higher priority on cable than DSL.
Regardless, phone lines reach further into rural areas, and
currently provide a more consistent service in higher-populated
areas.</p><p>Cable service is supposed to be faster than DSL (by up to
10MBps), but since users are clumped together in hubs, speed can be
greatly affected as the number of users rises. The cost of cable is
slightly lower, as are installation fees. Prices for TCI's @Home
cable Internet service is currently $39.95 per month, with a $150
installation fee. However, you do not have the option of choosing
an ISP&mdash;that is part of the package, and not surprisingly has led
to a few lawsuits. The basics are that smaller ISPs want access to
cable lines, and the larger companies don't want to give it. As it
stands now, AT&amp;T has one ISP it uses&mdash;Excite@Home. Another ISP
wanting to use AT&amp;T lines would be charged for using those
lines, which would mean the customer cost would go up
accordingly.</p><p>I should note that I could find no indication that the TCI
cable service supports Linux, while all those involved in my
potential DSL plan do. And the TCI@Home web site says it &ldquo;is for
residential, casual use only and does not support servers.&rdquo;</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbc580.0xdb5000"></a>Jockeying for Position</h2></div></div><p>Bringing costs down will have to become a major priority for
both cable companies and the telcos. In an interesting move, on
December 6 AT&amp;T decided to offer the lines to competitors,
although terms are not yet clear. What is clear is that many are
fighting for entry into what promises to be a lucrative industry. A
few ISP's are attempting to offer free DSL service by as early as
March 15. Broadband Digital Group (a southern California company),
iNYC (New York) and Staruni (Beverly Hills) are currently working
to do just that (John Borland, CNET News.com, 1/13/00). The ISPs
will collect demographic information by requiring users to click on
a certain number of banner ads daily. They will then, no doubt,
turn around and sell their findings to advertisers, who will
complete the circle with more banner ads. Analysts are skeptical of
this plan, since the cost of providing high-speed Internet access
will still be high.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbc580.0xdb5108"></a>The FCC to the Rescue?</h2></div></div><p>Covad extends DSL coverage but has to buy lines from US West,
resulting in an extra $20 to $30 charge per month. Basically, I am
forced to split my phone line into two lines (which is exactly what
I had hoped to avoid) and am being charged accordingly. This
situation may soon change. An article in
<span   class="emphasis"><em>ZDNet</em></span>, &ldquo;FCC Mandates Line Sharing&rdquo; from
November 18th, 1999, states, &ldquo;The Federal Communications
Commission today ruled that regional telephone companies must share
local-loop lines with Digital Subscriber Line competitors.&rdquo; Of
course, the telcos are less than happy about this, as they are
reluctant to undercut their current T1 services. Regardless, it
seems the result will be cheaper DSL subscriptions, which should
ensure the propagation of DSL technology. The mandate will be
challenged, and people like me will just have to deal with inflated
prices until the legal wrestling is finished.</p></div><div class="simplesect" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title"><a name="N0xcbc580.0xdb5268"></a>Do I Need High-Speed Internet Access?</h2></div></div><p>I have decided I am not ready to be a part of this tangled
web just yet, as I don't want to pay the extra fees. While I do not
possess the patience of Job, I can manage with a 56K modem for now,
at least until the big corporations hammer out accords and mergers,
etc. I will stress that I <span   class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> DSL service.
Once you have tried it, you will want it, too. Why run when you can
drive? Why cook with an oven when there's a microwave? The speed
achieved by using DSL or cable modem makes browsing the Internet
fun again.</p><p>Whether or not you make the plunge depends on what you wish
to accomplish and how much patience you have. If you run a
business, be it from home or not, a super-fast Internet connection
makes sense. Overall, the service is more of a
<span   class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span> than a <span   class="emphasis"><em>need</em></span>, but
that will change. We are a society hungry for speed and technology.
Dial-up modems have served a purpose and will now give way to
innovation. Within the next five years, you will most likely be
receiving Internet access, phone service, long-distance service and
cable from one company. In December 1999, Bell Atlantic was cleared
by the FCC to offer long-distance telephone service. This is the
first time, since the breakup of AT&amp;T, that this has been
allowed. What it means for Bell Atlantic is the ability to extend
coverage. If other telcos are given the same clearance and DSL
technology becomes widespread, thoroughly understood, and fully
supported, prices will drop and the traditional dial-up modems will
become door stops.</p></div></div>
